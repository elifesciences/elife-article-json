We analysed Dystrophin binding dynamics in vivo for the first time. Within maturing fibres of host zebrafish embryos, our analysis reveals a pool of diffusible Dystrophin and complexes bound at the fibre membrane. Combining modelling, an improved FRAP methodology and direct semi-quantitative analysis of bleaching suggests the existence of two membrane-bound Dystrophin populations with widely differing bound lifetimes: a stable, tightly bound pool, and a dynamic bound pool with high turnover rate that exchanges with the cytoplasmic pool. The three populations were found consistently in human and zebrafish Dystrophins overexpressed in wild-type or <i>dmd<sup>ta222a/ta222a</sup></i> zebrafish embryos, which lack Dystrophin, and in <i>Gt(dmd-Citrine)</i><sup><i>ct90a</i></sup> that express endogenously-driven tagged zebrafish Dystrophin. These results lead to a new model for Dystrophin membrane association in developing muscle, and highlight our methodology as a valuable strategy for in vivo analysis of complex protein dynamics."

We analysed Dystrophin binding dynamics in vivo for the first time. Within maturing fibres of host zebrafish embryos, our analysis reveals a pool of diffusible Dystrophin and complexes bound at the fibre membrane. Combining modelling, an improved FRAP methodology and direct semi-quantitative analysis of bleaching suggests the existence of two membrane-bound Dystrophin populations with widely differing bound lifetimes: a stable, tightly bound pool, and a dynamic bound pool with high turnover rate that exchanges with the cytoplasmic pool. The three populations were found consistently in human and zebrafish Dystrophins overexpressed in wild-type or <i>dmd<sup>ta222a/ta222a</sup></i> zebrafish embryos, which lack Dystrophin, and in <i>Gt(dmd-Citrine)</i><sup><i>ct90a</i></sup> that express endogenously-driven tagged zebrafish Dystrophin. These results lead to a new model for Dystrophin membrane association in developing muscle, and highlight our methodology as a valuable strategy for in vivo analysis of complex protein dynamics."

Mutations in the gene that encodes Dystrophin can cause several different types of muscular dystrophy, a group of diseases in which muscle progressively weakens. Some mutations in Dystrophin can lead to mild symptoms that may affect the quality of life but are not life threatening. However, in more serious cases, patients lose the ability to walk in childhood and have shortened life expectancy. There is no cure for these diseases, and there are still big gaps in our understanding of how Dystrophin works, which makes it more difficult to develop efficient therapies."

For example, many current approaches for gene therapy in DMD aim to restore \u2018short\u2019 Dystrophins, known to be partially functional from studies of patients with BMD and murine transgenic models (<a href=\"#bib38\">Konieczny et al., 2013</a>). How the dynamics of these proteins compare with those of full-length Dystrophin has not been addressed due to the lack of a suitable method. However, if some short Dystrophin forms bind more efficiently and stably than others this will have an impact on the relative amount of protein necessary to recover function.

Several mutant and transgenic lines have been used as model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and testing potential therapeutic targets (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kunkel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Johnson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kawahara and Kunkel, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Waugh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wood and Currie, 2014</a>).

Both species show developmental progression towards the adult localisation of Dystrophin. In human embryos, Dystrophin first appears in the cytoplasm, at the tips of myotubes, then becomes widespread throughout the myofibres in foetal stages (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wessels et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Clerk et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chevron et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mora et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Torelli et al., 1999</a>). In embryonic zebrafish muscle, Dystrophin transcripts are reported to accumulate initially in the cytoplasm, and from 24 hr post fertilization (hpf) until early larval stages, Dystrophin protein and transcripts are primarily located at muscle fibre tips (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bassett et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Guyon et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">B\u00f6hm et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ruf-Zamojski et al., 2015</a>).

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) requires stable confocal imaging of submicron volumes and is thus sensitive to drift in living tissue. Moreover, FCS is only applicable over a limited range of fluorophore concentrations and is greatly impeded by the presence of significant quantities of immobile fluorophores. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) avoids these problems. However, imaging in a living organism is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio that worsens as tissue thickness increases and protein abundance decreases. In addition, cells are located at variable optical depths and have varying shapes and protein levels, all of which introduces variability. This hampers identification of real variation in protein dynamics and prevents the common procedure of pooling data from multiple cells to reduce noise."

We thoroughly characterize the expression of the exogenous human Dystrophin within zebrafish host muscle cells. Overexpression often results in an excess of cytoplasmic Dystrophin, which is taken into account on the analysis of Dystrophin binding dynamics. We demonstrate that Dystrophin diffuses freely in the zebrafish muscle fibre cytoplasm and determine its diffusion constant. At the binding sites localised at the muscle cell tips, we found the existence of two membrane-bound pools with distinct binding constants: an immobile pool bound stably during our imaging timescale and a mobile-bound pool with a highly dynamic turnover. We test several potential factors that could potentially interfere with the binding dynamics of Dystrophin, or with its analysis, and result in wrong identification of a labile-bound pool: lateral diffusion of bound Dystrophin, transient dark state of fluorescent proteins, artificial increase of the cytoplasmic pool, competition with endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin, or weak interaction between inter-species proteins. Our data allowed us to dismiss all these hypotheses, supporting the real existence of two bound forms of Dystrophin in maturing fibres of the zebrafish embryo. Taken together, these results suggest a model for Dystrophin association with the membrane and provide a baseline and a validated methodology to analyse how modifications in Dystrophin structure may alter its dynamics."

In contrast, the fluorescence at the tips does not increase with the total fluorescence of the fibre (green circles in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), indicating that tip binding is limited by the presence of a limited number of binding sites that easily saturate. Thus, the accumulation of huDysGFP in the fibre cytoplasm does not appear to affect the binding at the tips. Also, fibre tips generally had greater fluorescence intensity than fibre cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). High intensities at the tips can be achieved even with low cytoplasmic huDysGFP concentrations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Moreover, at low overall fibre intensities, there is clear preference for accumulation at the tips (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). All these data indicate that human Dystrophin is preferentially bound at the zebrafish fibre tips regardless of the amount of cytoplasmic Dystrophin."

Even in the best imaging conditions, one faces the challenge of low signal-to-noise ratio that worsens as tissue thickness increases and protein abundance decreases. Although we are able to detect cytoplasmic huDysGFP, the signal is weak and the signal-to-noise ratio in single pixels or even small volumes is low (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To address these issues, we increase the signal by increasing laser power and studying large areas (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Under these conditions, we acquire a consistent signal both for GFP and huDysGFP. However, using a high laser power to image over large areas results in significant photobleaching during imaging, and, even at 100% laser power, bleaching is so slow that significant diffusion occurs during bleaching (<a href=\"#bib64\">Weiss, 2004</a>). We compensate for both using a mathematical model applied to the FRAP experimental data (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). This was integrated in a user-friendly application written to allow easy data analysis of multiple experiments (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

We studied diffusion along the long axis of the muscle cell (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The selected fibre is oriented such that the image <i>X</i>-axis aligns to the fibre long axis (i.e., roughly anterior-posterior in the animal) and the <i>Y</i>-axis is dorso-ventral (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013F</a>). In each cell, one or two large rectangles of different sizes (narrow and wide) were bleached, avoiding nuclei (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The bleached rectangles are shorter along the <i>X</i>-axis than in <i>Y</i> and cross the entire cell transversely. This makes recovery almost entirely due to mobility along the <i>X</i>-axis, simplifying modelling and fitting. We analyse the profile along the <i>X</i>-axis taken immediately after bleaching GFP-expressing fibres (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This profile is not a top-hat but a Gaussian, much wider than the region actually bleached, consistent with diffusion during the bleaching phase.

The small cell-to-cell variation in huDysGFP, relative to the variation between cells suggests that the mobility of huDysGFP genuinely varies from one fibre to another.

The width of the bleached region in pixels is indicated for each data set (one pixel is 0.147 \u03bcm wide). Intentional bleaching was performed between time points 20 and 21. Two-parameter, <i>D</i> and <i>\u03b2,</i> fits were performed to long acquisition times, either to time points 21 to 200 (\u223c40 s) or time points 21 to 500 (\u223c110 s). One-parameter fits were also performed to only the initial recovery curve (points 21 to 50, or \u223c7 s). For the latter fits, bleaching during imaging is too small to fit <i>\u03b2</i>, so we fix <i>\u03b2</i> = 0. Results of fits to FRAP curves for GFP and huDysGFP are presented for a model using either the actual fibre length and bleach position or with the standard length of 90 \u03bcm and a bleach position at 45 \u03bcm. Note that in most GFP cases, the difference between the fitted <i>D</i> values for standard and actual lengths and bleach positions is less than 1 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s. This is smaller than our estimate of the uncertainties in these <i>D</i> values, which is several \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s. For huDysGFP, there was no difference within two significant figures. Due to the smaller diffusion constants of huDysGFP, varying the cell length within these limits makes no difference to the values of <i>D</i>. During a \u223c30-s experiment, the bleached profile is not affected by a fibre tip \u223c45 \u03bcm away, for values of <i>D</i> typical of huDysGFP. Values of <i>D</i> in the main text are obtained using all <i>D</i> values obtained for two-parameter fits to data to point 200, using model cells with the standard cell length and bleach position."

The Dystrophin profile immediately after bleaching, similar to that of GFP, is not a top-hat but a Gaussian, wider than the region actually bleached, and consistent with diffusion during the bleaching phase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). However, the Gaussian's amplitude is narrower and the depth greater for huDysGFP than GFP, consistent with slower diffusion (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>). Indeed, <i>D</i><sub>huDysGFP</sub> best-fit values (fitted to data over \u223c40 s) ranged from 1.4 to 10.1 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>, with a mean of 4.4 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Again, the Gaussian profile and our ability to fit a simple diffusion model to the recovery are strong evidence for huDysGFP diffusion, and rule out large scale (above \u03bcm) directed motion along the long axis of the cell, or significant binding of huDysGFP to immobile structures."

By comparing narrow and wide bleaches in the same cell across our population of muscle fibres, we found that <i>D</i><sub>huDysGFP</sub> appears to vary between cells, that is, there is real variability in huDysGFP cytoplasmic dynamics from one cell to another. The difference between <i>D</i><sub>huDysGFP</sub> values for a pair of experiments in the same cell is significantly smaller than between values in different cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Pairs of <i>D</i> values obtained from the same cell are well correlated (<i>R</i><sub>huDysGFP</sub> = 0.9813; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). This indicates that Dystrophin's diffusion in the cytoplasm shows important variations from cell to cell but that it is consistent within one cell. Further, this finding highlights the limitations of reducing noise by \u2018pooling\u2019 FRAP results from more than one cell. Therefore, each FRAP curve was analysed independently throughout this study and pooling was deliberately avoided. The original data and relevant analysis files for each case are available online (<a href=\"#bib70\">Bajanca et al., 2015</a>) to complement representative examples shown in figures and main data summarised in tables. We conclude that, although there is fibre-specific variation of <i>D</i>, there is no evidence that cytoplasmic Dystrophin either binds cytoskeletal elements or is actively transported towards fibre tips."

FRAP can test whether huDysGFP is able to bind stably at the tips and reveal binding dynamics, but this is a challenging task. Diffusion of cytoplasmic protein into the bleached area, combined with bleaching-due-to-imaging, masks the real binding dynamics. We tested diffusion-plus-binding models to analyse the tip FRAP curves but these require too many variables to be reliably fitted, reflecting the complexity of the binding dynamics, as will be shown. The relatively featureless, and noisy, recovery curves of in vivo FRAP within a complex tissue cannot adequately constrain this number of variables (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sadegh Zadeh et al., 2006</a>). Instead, to understand human Dystrophin dynamics at the tip, we use direct semi-quantitative analysis of bleaching and recovery. A FRAP protocol that bleached only part of the tip allowed comparison of bleached and unbleached regions of the tip (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We combined this with analysis of the cytoplasm intensity near the tip in each cell to measure how much recovery to expect due to diffusion. In addition, recovery is followed at an initial fast acquisition rate to detect fast recovery, and then at a slower pace over longer time periods with reduced bleaching-due-to-imaging (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

Second, the normalized intensity difference between the unbleached and bleached regions in most tips (black crosses in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a>) reaches a plateau above zero (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). At the end of the experiment, both halves of the tip have received the same amount of light (and thus bleaching) for \u223c250 s after the intentional bleaching phase, so the difference observed is created by the huDysGFP bleached earlier that did not turn over. Third, in the unbleached half of the tip, which receives the same bleaching-due-to-imaging as the cytoplasm, both the normalized and the absolute drops in intensity from start to end of the experiment are much larger than in the cytoplasm (compare drops in the tips with those in the cytoplasms in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>).

Surprisingly, the FRAP curves revealed complex binding dynamics of Dystrophin at the tips that vary between fibres. We analysed the recovery pattern in the bleached region when switching to a slow acquisition regimen (transition from step 3 to 4 in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Despite the very slow turnover that characterizes the immobile-bound pool at the tips, for many fibres there is an almost immediate partial recovery (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a>). A shift of the dynamic equilibrium between dark-state and excitable GFP could result in apparent recovery following a switch to slow acquisition speed (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mueller et al., 2012</a>). However, we verified that the extent to which this phenomenon occurs in huDysGFP could only justify a very small fraction of recovery (&lt;1%, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We next evaluated the contribution of free diffusion of cytoplasmic huDysGFP into the bleached region, occurring as demonstrated with a <i>D</i> around 4 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>. As the bleached region contains bound and unbound huDysGFP and both are subjected to bleaching, it is not straightforward to analyse the recovery against a control cytoplasmic region, which is not subjected to intentional bleaching. Therefore, we compared unbleached tip and cytoplasm traces, which were submitted to comparable experimental conditions, without intentional bleaching but with strong bleaching-due-to-imaging during the fast acquisition phase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). On switching to slow acquisition, any recovery on the unbleached tip would be expected to parallel the recovery on the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, the immediate recovery is in most cases larger than that expected from diffusion of cytoplasmic huDysGFP despite a steady state is reached soon after, characteristic of the large immobile pool (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, compare open or hatched squares [unbleached tip] with the respective open or hatched triangles [cytoplasm]). In most cases, at least 50% of the total recovery of unnormalised unbleached minus cytoplasm curves occur within 10 s (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). This indicates that there is an unaccounted third pool of huDysGFP, in addition to the immobile-bound pool and the cytoplasmic-free diffusible pool: a rapidly turning-over dynamic bound huDysGFP pool."

However, the extent of the recovery is still dependent on the amount of cytoplasmic huDysGFP in a fibre (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,F</a>). Note that in the scatter plot of fractional recovery against cytoplasmic huDysGFP intensity, fibre tips with negligible cytoplasmic huDysGFP show very low recovery (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This suggests that cytoplasmic protein is required for the dynamic recovery. Interestingly, tips with high cytoplasmic huDysGFP intensity near the tip do not necessarily recover more (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,E,F</a>) indicating real tip-to-tip variation in the dynamic bound pool. The two tips of the same fibre behave similarly in some but not all cases (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

Thus, recovery of the dynamic bound pool is fast enough that it may be limited by diffusion. If there is a characteristic binding lifetime, it is at most a few seconds. In summary, our data indicate that most fibres have two pools of huDysGFP bound at their tips, a tightly bound pool stable for at least minutes and another with a sub-second to a few seconds turnover time."

We examined intensity profiles along the <i>X</i><sub>T</sub> axis, parallel to the tip membrane (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). After deliberately bleaching part of the tip, we looked for a gradient in fluorescence recovery along <i>X</i><sub>T</sub> that could arise from mobility of bound Dystrophin. If the bound Dystrophin is mobile at the tip in the plane of the membrane, bleached bound huDysGFP would leave the deliberately bleached half of the tip and be replaced by fluorescent huDysGFP from the unbleached half. This would help drive fluorescence recovery and would be especially pronounced at the boundary between the bleached and unbleached halves of the tip, generating a gradient of fluorescence along the <i>X</i><sub>T</sub> axis. We see no evidence of such gradients (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In particular, in the middle panel of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, although there is substantial recovery (compare the turquoise crosses with the immediately post-bleach orange triangles), there is no overall tendency in the intensity in the unbleached part of the tip to decrease from right to left as the bleached tip area is approached. The same applies to cases of little recovery (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), where only substantial bleaching-due-to-imaging is observed on the unbleached tip half. The lack of evidence of lateral mobility of bound huDysGFP argues in favour of the existence of a bound-mobile pool with a fast turnover rate responsible for the fast fluorescence recovery observed in most fibres."

In the absence of competition with the endogenous protein, huDysGFP appears to occupy more of the available binding sites, showing a 2.5-fold increase in the intensity ratio tips:cytoplasm compared to that found in wild-type background. This indicates that fibres expressing the same intensity in the cytoplasm can accumulate more at the fibre tips in the mutant background, consistent with the view that huDysGFP overexpression in the wild-type background does not displace all endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin."

Regardless of the genotype, most tips show the three typical signatures of an immobile-bound population described above: only partial recovery in the tip bleached region independently of the cytoplasmic intensity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>), the normalized intensity difference between the unbleached and bleached regions in most tips reaches a plateau above zero (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>), and unbleached tip half intensity shows higher drop than the cytoplasm in the fast acquisition phase (see original curves in <a href=\"#bib70\">Bajanca et al., 2015</a>). Also regardless of the genotype, the tip intensity registers a rapid recovery that is uncharacteristic of an immobile fraction while higher than the estimated contribution of the cytoplasmic pool. Evidence is clear when comparing events on switching between fast and slow acquisition in the unbleached tip half and cytoplasm unnormalised intensity curves. At least 50% of the total recovery occurs within 10 s in most fibre tips, too fast for the immobile-bound pool (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Overall, our analysis found no significant differences between huDysGFP binding dynamics in wild-type, <i>dmd</i><sup><i>ta222a/ta222a</i></sup> or their siblings. These results suggest that the presence of two bound populations of huDysGFP with different turnover times is not due to competition with endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin."

Exogenous zfDysGFP is able to rescue the dystrophic phenotype in <i>dmd</i><sup><i>ta222a/ta222a</i></sup> mutants (32/32, p = 0.003; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Like huDysGFP, most zfDysGFP tips show the typical signatures of an immobile-bound population regardless of the genotype (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013F</a>; <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). There are no statistically significant differences between the fractional recoveries of Dystrophin of the different species and in the different genetic backgrounds (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). However, the final unbleached minus bleached intensity of huDysGFP is statistically significantly lower than zfDysGFP (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). Using a two-way ANOVA to test the effect of genotypic background (wild-type or <i>dmd</i><sup><i>ta222a/ta222a</i></sup>) and Dystrophin origin (human or zebrafish) on the immobile fraction, we observed a significant effect of Dystrophin origin (human vs zebrafish) [F(1,87) = 11.21, p = 0.0012] but not of the host genotype [F(1,87) = 0.02326, p = 0.8791], and there was no significant interaction between origin and genotype [F(1,87) = 1.367, p = 0.2455]. While a final unbleached minus bleached intensity above zero indicates the existence of an immobile-bound fraction, its value is not a direct measurement of the amount of immobile-bound Dystrophin. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that huDysGFP forms less, or less stable, immobile-bound links than zfDysGFP, in the zebrafish environment. The background genotype appears not to influence this trait, suggesting that if there is a difference in the immobile fraction that is independent from competition with endogenous Dystrophin."

Typically, at least 50% of the total recovery of unbleached tip half minus cytoplasm intensity curves occurs within 10 s in the majority of the cases, regardless of species and genotype (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>; <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). This recovery is very fast and the characteristic immobile pool plateau is soon reached, suggesting the existence of an additional bound pool of zfDysGFP with rapid turnover. These results show that, like huDysGFP, zfDysGFP can be found in three populations, one diffusible and two bound with different binding lifetimes. Therefore, regardless of any differences between huDysGFP and zfDysGFP, our results confirm that the mobile-bound pool previously found for the human Dystrophin is not caused by weaker interactions with a different species environment."

As every muscle fibre expresses Citrine-tagged Dystrophin (zfDysCitrine; <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>), and different tissues may have different background fluorescence, it is not easy to evaluate with confidence whether there are low levels of cytoplasmic zfDysCitrine above the background. We hypothesized that if there is zfDysCitrine in the cytoplasm, we should register a recovery after photobleaching. Control siblings lacking zfDysCitrine show a flat and noisy FRAP curve that reflects the background fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>, plot a). In contrast, the very low zfDysCitrine intensity detected in the cytoplasm could be bleached to even lower levels, and a recovery curve is registered, indicating the presence of diffusible zfDysCitrine in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>, plot b). The switch from a dark state of Citrine was evaluated and contributes little to the recovery (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>, plot c). Another signature of the presence of diffusible zfDysCitrine was the inverted bell-shaped, instead of top-hat, Gaussian curve that results from diffusion during intentional bleaching (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). Finally, zfDysCitrine recovery curves can be fit using a diffusion model (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). <i>D</i><sub><i>zfDysCitrine</i></sub> best-fit values ranged from 0.9 to 4.3 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> and mean 2.2 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>).

This suggests the presence of a mobile-bound pool, regardless of the statistically significant difference in the time it takes for zfDysCitrine and zfDysGFP to recover (p = 0.0016). The tendency to take longer to recover is likely to reflect the dependency of the mobile-bound pool on cytoplasmic availability of free Dystrophin. This is in accordance with our previous observations that recovery of the mobile-bound pool is fast enough that it may be limited by diffusion. The data therefore indicate that endogenous Dystrophin with an inserted Citrine, like exogenous zfDysGFP and huDysGFP, can be found in two states, immobile and mobile, regardless of a very low, but detectable, cytoplasmic pool."

A stable-bound pool is consistent with Dystrophin's well-described function of sustaining mechanical stability upon muscle contraction (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Levine et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ervasti and Campbell, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rybakova et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2000</a>). Additionally, the presence of a dynamic pool with weak and short-term binding points to a new aspect of Dystrophin biology. Based on these results, we propose a model for Dystrophin association with the membrane (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Even very low levels of freely diffusible cytoplasmic Dystrophin can stochastically bind to molecules at the plasma membrane, entering a mobile-bound state (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>, arrows). This may represent an intermediate state towards Dystrophin stabilization, possibly more abundant in the immature fibres of the developing embryo (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>, dashed arrow 1). Alternatively, Dystrophin may coexist in two distinct bound forms with specific roles, possibly reflecting the mature state of the membrane association."

Here, we show that exogenous zebrafish and human Dystrophin have subcellular localizations, at both mRNA and protein levels, equivalent to that of endogenous Dystrophin (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ruf-Zamojski et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, exogenous zebrafish and human Dystrophin have diffusion and binding dynamics similar to those of endogenous zebrafish Dystrophin, in spite of the artificially raised cytoplasmic levels caused by over-expression. Furthermore, we found that Dystrophin dynamics is not affected by the position of the fluorescent tag (internally close to the actin binding site [Citrine] or in C-terminal position [GFP]). Importantly, both zebrafish and human Dystrophins were able to rescue the dystrophic phenotype of <i>dmd</i><sup><i>ta222a/ta222a</i></sup> embryos. Taken together, these data indicate that the zebrafish embryo is a good model system to study the dynamics of human Dystrophin in live muscle cells in vivo using fluorescently tagged versions of the protein. It is important to keep in mind that human Dystrophin may behave differently in zebrafish than in human muscle. The FRAP analysis methodology developed in this study could be applied for studies on human primary muscle cell cultures, or even pluripotent human stem cells differentiated into muscle fibres (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chal et al., 2015</a>). However, until a suitable 3D ex-vivo physiologically relevant human muscle system is readily available for routine experimentation, our methodology and findings provide a baseline for future comparative studies. For instance, the strategy presented here can be used to study the effects of shortening the protein on Dystrophin dynamics, as occurs in patients with BMD and planned exon-skipping gene therapies (<a href=\"#bib37\">Koenig et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cirak et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Konieczny et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Verhaart et al., 2014</a>)."

Despite considerable apparent variation in measured diffusion constant (<i>D</i>) from fibre to fibre (1.4\u201310.1 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> for <i>D</i><sub><i>huDysGFP</i></sub>, 0.6 to 6.7 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> for <i>D</i><sub><i>zfDysGFP</i></sub>, 0.9 to 4.3 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> for <i>D</i><sub><i>zfDysCitrine</i></sub>, mean 4 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>, 3 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u20141</sup>, and 2 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u20141</sup>, respectively), it is clear that the mobility of Dystrophin is on average around a fourth that of GFP, at approximately 13 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>. However, whereas GFP is a small (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 nm) globular protein, Dystrophin is thought to be a rod perhaps 100 nm long (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pons et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arrio-Dupont et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bhasin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kameta et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kinsey et al., 2011</a>), so a diffusion constant only a quarter that of GFP is surprising. As Dystrophin appears to diffuse, perhaps so-called \u2018active diffusion\u2019 due to energy-using cellular processes (e.g., molecular motors) enhances its apparent mobility in a non-directed manner (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brangwynne et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Weber et al., 2012</a>). As whole Dystrophin structure has not been reported, one can imagine that a compact rapidly diffusing Dystrophin conformation may account for Dystrophin dynamics in vivo. For now, it is not known whether cytoplasmic Dystrophin also exists in low amounts in adult human skeletal muscle cells. However, many studies have shown that, in human embryos and foetuses, Dystrophin first appears in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wessels et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Clerk et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chevron et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mora et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Torelli et al., 1999</a>). Interestingly, a cytoplasmic Dystrophin pool was also found in the adult heart (<a href=\"#bib50\">Peri et al., 1994</a>) and in both regenerating fibres (<a href=\"#bib32\">K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen et al., 2000</a>) and differentiating human primary muscle cultures (<a href=\"#bib45\">Miranda et al., 1988</a>), where Dystrophin localisation was suggested to recapitulate the embryonic process of Dystrophin deposition, accumulating initially in the cytoplasm and muscle\u2013tendon junctions at the fibre ends, prior to maturing towards costameric localisation. Therefore, it would be particularly interesting to analyse Dystrophin dynamics in the cytoplasm of human dystrophic muscle cells, which undergo repeated cycles of regeneration."

It is not clear whether the dynamics of early tip-localised Dystrophin is different from the later costameric Dystrophin.

Dystrophin in the bound mobile pool presumably cannot transmit significant force. However, weak binding would allow response to weak short-lived (sub-pN/molecule, sub-second) forces or may fulfil another function, such as structure assembly, sensing, or signalling. Interestingly, studies of mutants of ezrin, which, like Dystrophin, binds both \u03b2-dystroglycan and actin, revealed immobile and mobile membrane bound forms (<a href=\"#bib20\">Coscoy et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Spence et al., 2004</a>). The dynamic membrane-bound ezrin was suggested to be an intermediate conformation state leading to actin anchoring and full complex assembly. Similarly, it is possible that Dystrophin binding to \u03b2-dystroglycan facilitates a conformation change to promote actin binding and stabilization of the complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Friedel et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Membrane localization, turnover, and clustering of other adhesion molecules such as cadherins is known to be influenced by the tension experienced by the cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Delano\u00eb-Ayari et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yonemura et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">De Beco et al., 2015</a>).

Nonetheless, we observed that muscle cells accumulate Dystrophin protein much more frequently than other cell types, suggesting that human Dystrophin stabilization is tissue dependent. The availability of suitable docking sites or specific partner proteins may play a role in stabilization (<a href=\"#bib42\">Le Rumeur et al., 1804</a>). In addition, sub-cellular accumulation of the mRNA itself may contribute to Dystrophin positioning at the tip. Like zebrafish Dystrophin mRNA, RNA encoding human Dystrophin localized near the tips of fibres. The expression constructs engineered in the present study do not contain the Dystrophin 5\u2032- or 3\u2032-UTR or introns. Instead, the coding sequence is preceded by a standard chimaeric intron. While previous studies showed a role for 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR regions into controlling tissue-specific expression and transcriptional regulation of Dystrophin (see <a href=\"#bib41\">Larsen and Howard, 2014</a> and references therein), our results show that UTR regions are dispensable for accumulation of the mRNA at the tip. It is therefore unlikely that Dystrophin RNA accumulation at the tips is due to specific RNA transport since that would most likely require the presence of the untranslated regions (for review see <a href=\"#bib36\">Kloc et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Holt and Bullock, 2009</a>). Thus, the signals controlling the correct localization of the mRNA remain unclear. One possibility is anchorage by numerous nascent protein chains (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). This might then facilitate transition of Dystrophin into the strongly bound form."

These advances may be generally valuable for studies of embryos and thick tissues or biomaterials by allowing higher laser powers. Also, our results show that pooling results from different cells in a complex in vivo environment may lead to error and mask individual cell-to-cell variability.

Photobleaching due to imaging lowers the final intensity; this effect and a small immobile pool may be indistinguishable.

Unnormalized intensity plots (background-subtracted) allow direct comparison of the amount that is unintentionally bleached and then recovers in the tip and the cytoplasm. Presumably, the size of the cytoplasmic component in a tip pixel is at most equal to that in a cytoplasmic pixel, and its FRAP dynamics are similar. Therefore, a permanent drop in tip intensity that is much larger than the drop in the cytoplasmic intensity indicates a large immobile pool. In addition, a dip for the tip signal that is much larger than that in the cytoplasm, and that rapidly recovers, indicates that there is a dynamic bound pool at that tip. Analysis of unnormalized minus cytoplasm intensity curves evaluates if at least 50% of the final recovery occurred at the first or second time points after switching from fast to slow (every 10 s) acquisition rates."

To image the whole cell, a 20\u00d7/1.0 W Plan-Apochromat (Zeiss) objective was used. Due to the size of a muscle cell, similar tests bleaching the entire cell are not possible to perform using exactly the same conditions as in our FRAP experiments, where a 40\u00d7/0.8 Achroplan (Zeiss) objective was used. However, the laser power per area is higher in the conditions we use both in cytoplasmic and tips FRAP experiments, which is demonstrated by <a href=\"#bib48\">Mueller et al. (2012)</a> to further decrease the effect of dark state. After whole-cell bleaching very low recovery after photobleaching is detected (&lt;1%), presumably due to a shift from dark state to excitable huDysGFP."

A WB analysis of total dystrophin would have clarified the level of overexpression. The cytoplasmic pool may be simply a consequence of the over expression and may not exist in a wt animal. Moreover, in order to conclusively demonstrate that human dystrophin functionally replaces the fish counterparts, experiments should have been performed in dystrophic zebrafish embryos, with the double advantage to be able to modulate the level of expression to wt levels and, equally important, to demonstrate that human dystrophin rescues muscular dystrophy in the fish. The authors mention that human dystrophin rescues muscular dystrophy in the fish only as \u201cunpublished\u201d in the Discussion. While it is understandable that they may want to publish these data separately, the problem of level of expression remains."

Moreover, accumulation at the muscle fibre tip is not observed in human muscle and this is a matter of concern to extrapolate that what observed in the zebrafish also occurs in human muscle. To conclusively demonstrate this, the experiments should be repeated in a well-differentiated DMD muscle fibre in vitro, as it is now possible to obtain with biomaterials and stretching.

While, of course, work in a model organism cannot be thoughtlessly applied to humans, it has nevertheless proved highly relevant in many areas of biomedicine. Secondly, it is incorrect to suppose, as Reviewer 2 seems to do, that we regard the observed cytoplasmic pool of Dystrophin as a key feature of our findings. We obviously did not explain clearly enough, for which we apologize. Like Reviewer 2, we think the large cytoplasmic pool present in some fibres is simply an artefact of over-expression. Nevertheless, we showed that the size of the cytoplasmic pool does not determine Dystrophin binding dynamics, and specifically, does not determine our new weakly membrane-bound Dystrophin pool. Thirdly, Reviewers 1 and 2 both thought we needed to demonstrate functional relevance. We now have data showing that human Dystrophin-GFP rescues the fish <i>dmd</i> mutant phenotype cell autonomously at a single fibre level.

Unfortunately, western blots are not relevant as our expression is intentionally mosaic in single isolated cells to permit FRAP. In addition, note that immunostaining using MANDRA1 antibody, which recognizes a conserved epitope on both human and zebrafish Dystrophins, does not show increased accumulation at the ends of fibres containing huDysGFP compared with adjacent fibres lacking huDysGFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, the presence of excess cytoplasmic huDysGFP likely displaces some of the endogenous Dystrophin, rather than forcing extra binding sites to form. Further, the huDysGFP intensity in the whole fibre and locally at the fibre tips was measured in wild-type embryos (where it coexists with the endogenous Dystrophin) and in <i>dmd</i><sup><i>ta222a</i></sup> dystrophic embryos (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). In the absence of competition with the endogenous protein, huDysGFP can occupy all the available binding sites, showing a 2.5 fold increase in the intensity ratio tips:cytoplasm comparing with that found in wild-type background. Or, in different words, fibres expressing the same intensity in the cytoplasm can accumulate more at the fibre ends in the mutant background. This nicely shows that our experiments in the wild type background were made in non-saturating conditions. Moreover, we have repeated the key FRAP experiments in the dystrophic background and our analysis found no differences regarding the cytoplasmic pool or the mobile and immobile bound fractions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>; Results section \u201cHuman Dystrophin efficiently rescues zebrafish dystrophic embryos and two bound pools are still found in the absence of competition with endogenous Dystrophin\u201d)."

Secondly, the weakly-bound Dystrophin pool can be found in fibres with no detectable or very low levels of cytoplasmic unbound huDysGFP (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,F</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), and cells with high cytoplasmic huDysGFP intensity do not necessarily recover more (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,E,F</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

Several other studies from different labs and using a wide range of different antibodies (including some of the most extensively used nowadays like DYS-1, DYS-2, DYS-3) confirm the initial cytoplasmic accumulation in human embryos and that the level of internal staining declines with age and is considerably lower in adult muscle (<a href=\"#bib18\">Clerk et al., 1992</a>; see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> in <a href=\"#bib16\">Chevron et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mora et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Torellia et al., 1999</a>).

In the original submission, it was our mistake not to properly highlight the similarity between human and zebrafish Dystrophin localisations, when both cell location and developmental stage are taken into account. Human Dystrophin localises in zebrafish embryonic muscles just as it localises in human embryonic muscles. As already mentioned above, several studies showed that in human embryos and foetuses Dystrophin first appears in the <i>cytoplasm</i>, at the ends of myotubes and then widespread, before becoming restricted to the sarcolemma (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a> in <a href=\"#bib65\">Wessels et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Clerk et al., 1992</a>; see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> in <a href=\"#bib16\">Chevron et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mora et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Torelli et al., 1999</a>).

While at the time they did not have the tools available to test their hypothesis, our results confirm the existence of a cytoplasmic pool of dystrophin in embryonic muscle cells. It would be nice to be able to analyse this cytoplasmic pool directly in human muscle cells. We now mention this point in the Discussion. We believe it is advantageous to analyse Dystrophin dynamics in developing muscle fibres in the embryo, where binding complexes are actively forming. In the adult, there are presumably more stable complexes with a slower turnover and the discrete details of the assembly mechanism may become harder to spot. However, in human DMD therapy situations the complexes will be forming de novo in existing and nascent regenerating fibres."

The fact that most studies focus on the costameres expression (which is commonly all that can be observed in a biopsy as surgeons do not perform biopsies near tendons) may in fact contribute to an incomplete view of the biology of Dystrophin in human cells. However, we would like to stress that as our data stands, we do not make direct extrapolations to the human muscle or DMD patients, but the working model arising from our data raises new questions and opens a new avenue for more applied research to follow. We added a statement to the Discussion acknowledging the importance of confirming the dynamics of human Dystrophin in human cells in future studies. We also integrate better the literature on dystrophin in human cells to make it clearer that what we observe in our experimental system fits with previous studies in embryonic and regenerating human muscles (Introduction and Discussion sections)."
