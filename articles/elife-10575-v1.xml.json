How these lesions give rise to diverse pathology is not well understood, partly because their proximal consequences have not been well-studied in mammalian cells. Here we provide two lines of evidence that mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction leads to alterations in one-carbon metabolism pathways. First, using hypothesis-generating metabolic, proteomic, and transcriptional profiling, followed by confirmatory experiments, we report that mitochondrial DNA depletion leads to an ATF4-mediated increase in serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration. Second, we show that lesioning the respiratory chain impairs mitochondrial production of formate from serine, and that in some cells, respiratory chain inhibition leads to growth defects upon serine withdrawal that are rescuable with purine or formate supplementation. Our work underscores the connection between the respiratory chain and one-carbon metabolism with implications for understanding mitochondrial pathogenesis."

How these lesions give rise to diverse pathology is not well understood, partly because their proximal consequences have not been well-studied in mammalian cells. Here we provide two lines of evidence that mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction leads to alterations in one-carbon metabolism pathways. First, using hypothesis-generating metabolic, proteomic, and transcriptional profiling, followed by confirmatory experiments, we report that mitochondrial DNA depletion leads to an ATF4-mediated increase in serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration. Second, we show that lesioning the respiratory chain impairs mitochondrial production of formate from serine, and that in some cells, respiratory chain inhibition leads to growth defects upon serine withdrawal that are rescuable with purine or formate supplementation. Our work underscores the connection between the respiratory chain and one-carbon metabolism with implications for understanding mitochondrial pathogenesis."

In yeast, early application of genomic profiling and genetic studies identified a transcriptional program (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liu and Butow, 2006</a>) that senses respiratory chain dysfunction, rewires metabolism to bypass a congested tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and promotes cellular survival. In worms, errors in mitochondrial biosynthesis trigger the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) to activate transcription of mitochondrial proteases and chaperones, proteins that reduce oxidative stress, and glycolytic enzymes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nargund et al., 2012</a>).

In some cell lines, this leads to dependence on exogenously provided serine in the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction.

Inhibition of complex I using rotenone gives subtle activation. Membrane potential dissipation using the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide <i>m</i>-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) fails to elicit activation of these genes, and indeed partially reversed ATF4 activation from mtDNA depletion. These results suggest that mtDNA depletion-triggered activation of ATF4 arises from redox stress due to a stalled respiratory chain, and not from defects in ATP synthesis or membrane depolarization."

Cells grown in media for 24\u2009hrs with 1\u2009mM lactate showed significantly higher expression of ATF4 target genes than with 1\u2009mM pyruvate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>). However, the magnitude of the changes is modest compared to those seen with either antimycin treatment or with mtDNA depletion. Therefore, while altered cellular redox balance appears to contribute to ATF4 activation, other factors, such as oxidative stress from stalling of the respiratory chain, may also be important when mtDNA is depleted."

To determine the contribution of serine biosynthesis to our observed increase in serine abundance, we performed isotopic tracer analysis using <sup>13</sup>C labeled glucose (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chaneton et al., 2012</a>). To avoid product inhibition of serine biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fell and Snell, 1988</a>), we used a low (50\u2009\u03bcM) concentration of unlabeled serine in the labeled glucose media. The analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>) shows that in response to mtDNA depletion, cells both produce more serine from glucose and take up less serine from the media. We estimate that the cell volume is at least 1000 fold smaller than the media volume in our experiments. Therefore, decreased serine uptake implies decreased overall serine consumption and not simply decreased serine accumulation in the cytoplasm."

Thus, loss of NAD+ reoxidation due to the loss of the mitochondrial respiratory chain could conceivably lead to impairment of mitochondrial 1C metabolism, as theorized previously (<a href=\"#bib12\">Desler et al., 2010</a>)."

Our model thus predicts an increase in abundance of methylene-THF. We inferred increased methylene-THF abundance by determining rates of serine isotopic scrambling (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Briefly, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-labeled serine generates <sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>-glycine and a <sup>13</sup>C labeled methylene-THF in mitochondria by the action of SHMT2. This labeled methylene-THF can recombine with an unlabeled glycine \u2013 which is present in excess \u2013 by the reverse action of SHMT2 to generate <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-serine. The rate of emergence of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-serine thus reads out methylene THF abundance. We performed these experiments in SHMT1 knockout cells (see below) to avoid interference from cytoplasmic folate reactions, and found increased emergence of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-serine upon mtDNA depletion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). We observed similarly increased serine scrambling by treatment with rotenone, which directly inhibits NADH reoxidation through respiratory complex I. Measurement of cellular NAD+:NADH ratios confirms that these are altered with both mtDNA depletion and rotenone treatment (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration likely shifts the redox state of the mitochondrial folate pool in favor of reduced species such as methylene-THF."

In mammals, homocysteine has two major fates: conversion to cysteine via transsulfuration, and conversion to methionine via remethylation; the latter process consumes cytoplasmic 1C units. Our hypothesized mitochondrial 1C compromise might therefore lead to increased homocysteine abundance and be in direct conflict with the strong observed decrease in homocysteine levels in both spent media and cell extract."

We conclude that remethylation is not a major fate for homocysteine in T-REx-293 cells, regardless of 1C availability.

Exogenous formate bypasses the need for its mitochondrial synthesis, and hypoxanthine is an alternate source of purines, the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of which requires 1C units. Experiments on OXPHOS-inhibited T-REx-293 cells with serine withdrawal showed near-complete rescue of growth when media was supplement with either 30 \u00b5M hypoxanthine or 3\u2009mM sodium formate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>).

To further determine the compartment specificity of serine fluxes, we used CRISPR/Cas9 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ran et al., 2013</a>) to knock out serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) genes in T-REx-293 cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). SHMT catalyzes the first step in folate-mediated production of formate from serine. Two isoforms exist in mammals: SHMT1, which is exclusively cytoplasmic, and SHMT2, which is mostly mitochondrial but has a cytoplasmic splice variant (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson and Stover, 2009</a>). As expected, knockout of SHMT2, but not SHMT1, abolished formate synthesis from serine in isolated mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2c</a>). In the presence of serine, neither SHMT1 KO nor SHMT2 KO cell lines required formate or hypoxanthine for growth, indicating that serine can be used to generate 1C units in either compartment. Without serine in the culturing media, SHMT2 KO cells showed strongly suppressed growth that could be rescued with formate, similarly to cells treated with RC inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>), whereas SHMT1 KO cells did not. We hypothesize that high levels of exogenous serine are required to drive conversion of serine to formyl-THF in the cytoplasm via SHMT1, likely because MTHFD1, the cytoplasmic enzyme that makes formate, is coupled to NADPH and thus favors formyl-THF consumption rather than generation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tibbetts and Appling, 2010</a>).

To investigate the roles of these other 1C precursors, we generated T-REx-293 cells with simultaneous knockout of both SHMT1 and SHMT2 genes. Supplementation with hypoxanthine and thymidine (HT) is required for cell growth in the absence of 1C metabolism (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hakala, 1957</a>), since 1C units are used for the synthesis of purines and of thymidylate (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tibbetts and Appling, 2010</a>). Therefore, we supplemented media with HT when we generated these double-KO (DKO) clones. DKO cells so generated were unable to grow on unsupplemented media, whereas most single knockouts and WT cells were able to grow (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). In all cases, formate (3\u2009mM) could replace HT to support DKO cell growth (not shown). We conclude from this that other sources of 1C are unable to completely replace serine-derived 1C units. Interestingly, hypoxanthine alone was also able to partially rescue DKO cell growth (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2e</a>), suggesting that an alternative pathway might be sufficient to supply 1C for thymidylate synthesis. Finally, DKO cells, when rescued using either formate or hypoxanthine, were no longer serine dependent even with antimycin treatment (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2f</a>), indicating that no other functions of serine account for its requirement in cells undergoing RC inhibition."

Indeed, ATF4 has recently been shown to mediate purine synthesis induction by mTORC1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ben-Sahra et al., 2016</a>). Transsulfuration constitutes another potentially adaptive element of the ATF4 response program, since it supports synthesis of glutathione, a key cellular ROS scavenger.

Since the ATF4 integrated stress response program encompasses a number of different genes and functions, we hypothesize that it contains both adaptive and maladaptive components.

First, we measured a media volume change of 12.0% in 6 cm plates with 3\u2009ml media over the course of 3 d, and re-scaled media metabolite measurements accordingly. Then, we used the log mean cell extract metabolite differences between the different samples to estimate the per-day growth rate difference due to doxycycline treatment. We then used the growth rate difference to estimate changes in the area-under-the-curve (AUC) exposure of media to cells and adjusted accordingly. While this adjustment entailed straightforward flux multiplication in the case of metabolites released to the media, metabolites strongly absorbed from the media were more difficult to treat because multiplication would give rise to cells absorbing more metabolite than was present in the base media. We therefore used an ad-hoc adjustment function for uptaken metabolites that satisfied three criteria: (1) its value and slope would match that for released metabolites at the zero flux boundary case; (2) it would be continuous for all uptake fluxes; (3) measurements of near-100% uptake would adjust to yield near-100% uptake.

We amplified this fragment from T-REx-293-derived complementary DNA using the PCR primers GATGAAGAGGAGGGTGAGGTCAAG and GCCACGCCTCCCACTGAGG, performed an additional 30 cycles of PCR using Gateway-flanked primers that also incorporated an ATG start codon, and recombined the resulting PCR product into the pDONR221 Gateway entry vector using BP Clonase II (Thermo\u00a0Fisher). We call the protein product of this insert GADD34\u25b3N. We encountered difficulties in selecting for lentivirally-transduced GADD34\u25b3N expression using puromycin resistance, and suspected that inhibition of the ATF4 response might make cells more susceptible to puromycin treatment. To work around this, we used restriction digestion to remove the puromycin resistance open reading frame from the pLX302 lentiviral expression vector (Addgene,\u00a0Cambridge,\u00a0MA) and used Gibson isothermal assembly (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gibson et al., 2009</a>) to replace it with GFP.

They were first seeded at 4.0\u00d710<sup>6</sup> each into three sets of replicate 15-cm plates with heavy (R10K8), medium (R6K4), and light (R0K0) SILAC media and grown for 3 d. They were then split into eight 15-cm plates for each condition. Doxycycline was added at 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml 2 d before the split to heavy labeled cells, and 1 d after the split to medium labeled cells. 3 d after the split, cells were trypsinized, and cells from replicate plates pooled and counted. 7\u00d710<sup>6</sup> cells from each condition were mixed, pelleted, aspirated, suspended in 8\u00a0M urea and sonicated. This sample was treated with dithiothreitol (1\u2009mM final), and iodoacetamide (6\u2009mM final) and proteins fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Each gel lane was cut into ten slices of approximately equal staining intensity, in-gel digested with trypsin, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry on a LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo, Inc.) following the procedure in <a href=\"#bib58\">Sancak et al.

A minimum of two quantified peptides was required for each quantified protein. The FDR for protein and peptide identification was set at 0.01. The IPI human database ver 3.65 was used and supplemental sequences from mitochondrial DNA and common contaminants such as keratins and serum proteins were included at search time.

Briefly, cell extracts (10\u2009\u03bcL) were diluted using 90\u2009\u03bcL of 74.9:24.9:0.2 vol/vol/vol acetonitrile/methanol/formic acid containing stable isotope-labeled internal standards (valine-d8, Isotec; and phenylalanine-d8, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories; Andover, MA). The samples were centrifuged (10\u2009min, 9000\u2009g, 4\u00b0C) and the supernatants were injected directly onto a 150 \u00d7 2\u2009mm Atlantis HILIC column (Waters; Milford, MA). The column was eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 250\u2009\u03bcl/min with 5% mobile phase A (10\u2009mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in water) for 1\u2009min followed by a linear gradient to 40% mobile phase B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) over 10\u2009min. The electrospray ionization voltage was 3.5 kV and data were acquired using full scan analysis over m/z 70\u2013800 at 70,000 resolution. LC-MS data were processed and visually inspected using TraceFinder 3.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA)."

Ethidium bromide was applied at 100 ng/ml, antimycin at 500 nM, rotenone at 100 nM, and oligomycin at 500 nM. CCCP was used at 5\u2009\u03bcM when alone and 3\u2009\u03bcM to rescue oligomycin treatment. On each split, cells were trypsinized, counted, and re-seeded to the original density. We used the cell counts to compute growth curves. Growth rates shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c</a> were computed by performing least-squares line fits to individual log-transformed growth traces from days 2\u20136. We omitted growth between days 0 and 2 because the drug-induced growth effects did not appear fully developed before day 2. 293MSR cells were grown identically. U251 cells were grown in triplicate in 6-cm plates at 1.2\u00d710<sup>5</sup> per plate, and rotenone treatment on U251 was at 50 nM. U251 cells were split at 2 d intervals, and the growth rates shown in <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a> are from days 2\u201310 in the U251 growth curves and days 0\u20136 in the 293MSR growth curves."

After 2 days, cells were taken from plates, re-suspended into liquid YPD, and counted. Next, an appropriate amount of cells were taken to inoculate a 3\u2009mL culture of SD +2% Dextrose (Sunrise Science, San Diego, CA) at 1x10<sup>6</sup>cells/ml. The resulting 3\u2009mL culture was placed in a New Brunswick Scientific (Edison,\u00a0NJ) model TC-7 roller drum on the fastest rotation until saturated (16\u2009hr). The cells were then counted and diluted back to 1x10<sup>6</sup>cells/ml in SD-serine-adenine+2% glycerol+2% ethanol with 5 nm Antimycin A. For the serine and adenine additions, 1X corresponds to 85.6 mg/L and 21 mg/L, respectively. To monitor growth in each condition, 150 uL of culture was placed in the wells of a 96-well plate and growth curves were done using the Bio Tek (Winooski,\u00a0VT)\u00a0Synergy H1 multi-mode plate reader. The growth conditions were 30\u00b0C with continuous low shaking. OD<sub>600</sub> was measured every 15 min for 48\u2009hr."

The primary stressor employed is a doxycyline inducible POLG dominant -negative mutant that depletes mitochondrial DNA. Upon doxycycline treatment, the metabolite profiling experiments identified commonly seen indicators of metabolic stress, such as an increase lactate or decrease in uridine. However, they also observed novel changes, including increases in serine and decreases in homocysteine. RNA profiling identified changes in genes that might be responsible for these changes. They determine that the transcripts of enzymes involved in serine biosynthesis increase upon doxycycline treatment, as do enzymes involved in transsulfuranation. The authors next identified ATF4 as a possible transcription factor that mediates the transcriptional response to mtDNA depletion, and determined that ATF4 responsive genes also changed in expression in response to other mitochondrial stresses. Proteomic profiling confirmed that core mitochondrial protein complexes decreased in abundance, and that enzymes involved in serine biosynthesis are increased."

Numerous reports have demonstrated that doxycycline inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis. The lab of Johan Auwerx has published work recently, including a study in Nature, showing that 1 ug/ml doxycycline (the dose used in this study to turn on POLGdn expression) substantially decreases COX1 levels and decreases oxygen consumption in hek293 cells. Furthermore, other reports have determined that doxycycline increases ATF4 levels, in a POLGdn-independent manner. This study would be strengthened if the effect of doxycycline-dependent mtDNA depletion and doxycycline-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis were differentiated. An appropriate control was performed for the transcription analysis. Within this data-set, it would be useful to compare which genes are doxycycline sensitive and which respond only to mtDNA depletion (i.e. do the levels of ATF4 responsive genes change upon exposure to doxycycline)?"

In the original paper describing this system, Jazyeri et al. determined a copy number of ~500 before mtDNA depletion in this system (compared to ~20, 000 here), which is more consistent with other analyses in mammalian cell lines. In this manuscript, the cells still have ~1000 copies of mtDNA per cell following depletion. Given that mtDNA depletion is the primary stressor used, it will be useful to re-assess whether the values in the Figure are correct, or whether a minor technical error has occurred and these values need to be re-normalized."

These experiments were performed using an alternative supplier of DMEM (US Biological compared to Invitrogen), so as the media could be made without serine. For those looking to repeat these experiments, it will be useful to specify more clearly in the Methods the DMEM components in the US Biological derived media. Specifically, it is necessary to state whether the home-made media contains the same amount of pyruvate as the Invitrogen media (1 mM pyruvate). Many commercial DMEMs do not contain pyruvate (including the base US biological DMEM), and variation in pyruvate experiments will greatly affect the results of these experiments."

The authors hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction impacts upon NAD+/ NADH levels and that this then perturbs mitochondrial 1C metabolism. This is a very plausible hypothesis, but it is difficult to test directly, and the follow up experiments do not appear to fully and unambiguously resolve how mitochondrial dysfunction increases serine levels, lead to serine dependency and fully clarify the role of 1C metabolism in these processes. To further explore the role of 1C metabolism a detailed study of the levels of mitochondrial 1C metabolites would have been useful, although it is technically difficult, so may be beyond the scope of this study. For example, as the authors note, in CFD caused by mitochondrial DNA depletion 5-methyltetrahydrofolate levels are substantially decreased \u2013 it would be useful to measure 5-mTHF levels in these cells. Similarly, the authors do not directly demonstrate that mitochondrial NAD+/NADH levels are altered."

A disadvantage of this system is that these cells are tolerant of severe mitochondrial stress (i.e. they can be used to make viable proliferating cells which contain no mtDNA). In fully differentiated cells, such as neurons or myocytes, which mtDNA depletion seems to affect most in vivo, the relative importance of the energetic component of mitochondrial stress and these secondary metabolic pathways is likely to be different. Full assessment of the relevance of these findings (such serine dependency upon mitochondrial stress) to metabolic disease will require the use of an animal model, but is beyond the scope of this study. The Discussion would be strengthened if a description of the limitations of the in vitro model were included."

Numerous reports have demonstrated that doxycycline inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis. The lab of Johan Auwerx has published work recently, including a study in Nature, showing that 1 ug/ml doxycycline (the dose used in this study to turn on POLGdn expression) substantially decreases COX1 levels and decreases oxygen consumption in hek293 cells. Furthermore, other reports have determined that doxycycline increases ATF4 levels, in a POLGdn-independent manner. This study would be strengthened if the effect of doxycycline-dependent mtDNA depletion and doxycycline-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis were differentiated. An appropriate control was performed for the transcription analysis. Within this data-set, it would be useful to compare which genes are doxycycline sensitive and which respond only to mtDNA depletion (i.e. do the levels of ATF4 responsive genes change upon exposure to doxycycline)?</i>"

We have performed the requested analysis of ATF4 activation in T-Rex-293 cells treated with doxycycline. Using motifADE, we observed a subtle but significant association between the ATF4 motif TGATGCAA and increased expression upon doxycycline treatment. However, the magnitude of this association is much stronger in cells expressing PolGdn: the \u03b4 median metric for the association was 0.213 (with nominal <i>P</i>\u22485.5\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>) for PolGdn-expressing cells, whereas it was 0.016 (with nominal <i>P</i>\u22481.6\u00d710<sup>-2</sup>) for the parent T-REx-293 cells. Indeed, if we perform motifADE analysis on the doxycycline control data and consider all possible 8-mers, the signal associated with TTGCATCA is not significant due to Bonferroni correction of the <i>p</i>-value. Individual ATF4 target genes also show much weaker \u2013 if any \u2013 activation with doxycycline treatment in the absence of POLGdn expression (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2). We now include a discussion of this finding in the main text, and compare degrees of gene activation in the two different cell lines in the new Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2. Furthermore, we note that we confirmed ATF4 activation in cells treated with ethidium bromide (EtBr) to induce mtDNA depletion (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Therefore, while doxycycline alone might contribute some small part of the transcriptional changes that we observe, the majority of those changes can be attributed to PolGdn overexpression and the ensuing mtDNA depletion."

We have included new data showing increased serine and decreased homocysteine levels in spent media when cells are treated with ethidium bromide to induce mtDNA depletion (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3). Furthermore, we note that our serine dependency growth studies were also performed using EtBr.

To further explore the role of 1C metabolism a detailed study of the levels of mitochondrial 1C metabolites would have been useful, although it is technically difficult, so may be beyond the scope of this study.

This conclusion is supported by our observation of very low rates of remethylation of homocysteine using formate-derived 1C units (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4) despite a high expression level of methionine synthetase in our cells, because 5-mTHF is a cofactor in that reaction."
