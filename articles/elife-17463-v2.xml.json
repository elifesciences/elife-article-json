While the TIM22 machinery has been well characterised in yeast, the human complex remains poorly characterised. Here, we identify Tim29 (C19orf52) as a novel, metazoan-specific subunit of the human TIM22 complex. The protein is integrated into the mitochondrial inner membrane with it\u2019s C-terminus exposed to the intermembrane space. Tim29 is required for the stability of the TIM22 complex and functions in the assembly of hTim22. Furthermore, Tim29 contacts the Translocase of the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane, TOM complex, enabling a mechanism for transport of hydrophobic carrier substrates across the aqueous intermembrane space. Identification of Tim29 highlights the significance of analysing mitochondrial import systems across phylogenetic boundaries, which can reveal novel components and mechanisms in higher organisms."

While the TIM22 machinery has been well characterised in yeast, the human complex remains poorly characterised. Here, we identify Tim29 (C19orf52) as a novel, metazoan-specific subunit of the human TIM22 complex. The protein is integrated into the mitochondrial inner membrane with it\u2019s C-terminus exposed to the intermembrane space. Tim29 is required for the stability of the TIM22 complex and functions in the assembly of hTim22. Furthermore, Tim29 contacts the Translocase of the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane, TOM complex, enabling a mechanism for transport of hydrophobic carrier substrates across the aqueous intermembrane space. Identification of Tim29 highlights the significance of analysing mitochondrial import systems across phylogenetic boundaries, which can reveal novel components and mechanisms in higher organisms."

Thus, the true architecture of the human TIM22 complex remains an open question. Given the many elaborate functions of mitochondria in human cells, including, cell death, metabolism, tumorigenicity and neurodegenerative disorders, we reasoned the composition of the TIM22 complex in human cells is likely different to yeast.

We generated a stable tetracycline-inducible HEK293T cell line expressing C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup>. Hypo-osmotic swelling and carbonate extraction treatments were performed on the isolated mitochondria. C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> was present in isolated mitochondria and only became accessible to external protease when the outer membrane was disrupted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, compare lanes 2 and 4), indicating the C-terminal FLAG tag is exposed to the intermembrane space. Outer membrane proteins Bak and Mfn2, Opa1 that is exposed to the intermembrane-space and matrix-located NDUFAF2 served as controls. C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> was resistant to carbonate treatment, like the membrane integrated Bak and Mfn2, indicating that it is likely an integral membrane protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In a similar manner, subfractionation and carbonate extraction of mitochondria isolated from cells expressing C19orf52<sup>1-89</sup> revealed that the truncated protein is also an integral membrane protein that exposes it\u2019s C-terminal FLAG tag to the intermembrane space (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Taken together this data indicates that C19orf52 is an integral inner membrane protein with a C-terminal domain exposed to the intermembrane space. Surprisingly, upon subfractionation and carbonate extraction of mitochondria isolated from cells expressing C19orf52<sup>\u25b316</sup> and C19orf52<sup>17-89</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C and D</a>) we noticed that these proteins failed to sort properly to the inner membrane, but appeared trapped in the outer membrane, most likely in the TOM complex (indicated by accessibility to protease and presence in both the pellet and supernatant fractions upon carbonate treatment). Thus, although the first 16 amino acids originally appeared to be dispensable for mitochondrial targeting, closer examination revealed that these residues are indeed crucial for subsequent sorting of C19orf52 to the inner membrane."

Mitochondria from hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> and C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> expressing cells were solubilised in digitonin-containing buffer prior to analysis by BN-PAGE and immunodecoration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). C19orf52 specific antibodies revealed the presence of a high molecular weight complex of approximately 450-kDa, reminiscent of the TIM22 complex in both control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, lane 1) and hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, lane 2). We observed a slight delay in the migration of the C19orf52-containing complex in mitochondria isolated from hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, lane 2 and 4). This suggested that C19orf52 is located within a hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup>-containing complex and the presence of the FLAG-tag is causing the observed delay in mobility. To interrogate this observation further, we performed antibody-shift analysis of the human TIM22 complex. In this case, [<sup>35</sup>S]-hTim22 was imported into mitochondria isolated from control, hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> and C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> expressing cells where it assembled into the mature TIM22 complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, lane 1, 4 and 7). Following import, mitochondria were isolated, solubilised in digitonin-containing buffer and incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-SDHA antibodies prior to BN-PAGE. As can be seen (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, lanes 2, and 8), the FLAG antibodies shifted [<sup>35</sup>S]-hTim22 (hTIM22 complex) in both hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> and C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> containing mitochondria, suggesting the presence of all three proteins within the same complex. In an alternative approach C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> was shown to specifically immunoprecipitate hTim22 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), while C19orf52 could be co-immunoprecipitated with hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). As a final source of confirmation immunoprecipitation of C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> and subsequent quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis revealed the presence of all known TIM22 complex subunits, including hTim22, hTim10b, hTim10a and hTim9 (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). These findings confirm that C19orf52 is a <i>bona fide</i> subunit of the human TIM22 complex, and represents a novel metazoan specific subunit of the translocation machine. Given that the molecular weight of the protein is 29\u2009kDa and the nomenclature of the mitochondrial protein import machinery (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pfanner et al., 1996</a>), we henceforth rename this protein as Tim29 and its gene as <i>TIMM29</i>."

To address the global impact of Tim29 and hTim22 KD on cell health and viability we monitored the impact of Tim29 and hTim22 KD on mitochondrial respiration, cell proliferation and cell viability. We measured mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates in intact cells by high-resolution respirometry to determine if the KD of Tim29 and hTim22 affects mitochondrial metabolism.

This observation and the decrease of endogenous TIM22 complex substrates in Tim29 KD cells, prompted us to address if this decrease was due to: (i) an active role of Tim29 in the import of substrates into the inner membrane, or (ii) a role of Tim29 in the biogenesis of the TIM22 complex itself. To address this, we investigated the in vitro\u00a0import and assembly of two well-established substrates of the TIM22 pathway, ANT1 and hTim23. While the assembly of ANT1 was reduced in the absence of hTim22 at 60\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; right panel), assembly of the protein proceeded like WT in the absence of Tim29 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; left panel). In contrast, the assembly of hTim23 was mildly reduced in mitochondria depleted of either Tim29 or hTim22 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We next addressed the assembly of the TIM22 complex itself using the radiolabelled hTim22. In mitochondria isolated from control cells, [<sup>35</sup>S]-hTim22 efficiently assembled into the 450-kDa TIM22 complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>, lanes 1\u20134), while there was a clear assembly defect into the TIM22 complex in mitochondria isolated from Tim29 KD cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lanes 5\u20138). The amount of assembled TIM22 complex in Tim29 KD mitochondria was lower than that in the control mitochondria by 53%, after a 60 min-import. To support this observation, we examined the difference in hTim22 protein assembly in control and Tim29 KD mitochondria using a two-tailed Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test. We obtained a <i>t</i>[2]\u00a0= 6.02 (p&lt;0.05), demonstrating a significant reduction in the assembly of hTim22 into the mature complex in Tim29 KD mitochondria. On the contrary, we consistently detected a moderate increase (~20%) in assembled TIM22 complex in hTim22 KD mitochondria after a 60 min-import compared to control mitochondria (<i>t</i>[2]\u00a0= \u22125.07, p&lt;0.05)."

Rather, the carrier pathway is described as a series of five stages, with stage 3 encompassing the transfer of substrates between the TOM and TIM22 complexes by the soluble intermembrane space Tim9-Tim10 complex (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chacinska et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rehling et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ryan et al., 1999</a>)."

While the yeast TIM22 complex and import pathway have been extensively characterised, the human TIM22 complex has remained ill defined. Conservation of members of the human TIM22 complex (hTim22 and small TIM proteins) based on sequence homology was originally published approximately 17 years ago (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bauer et al., 1999</a>). Advances and accessibility in techniques for purification of native complexes and mass spectrometry have now provided us with an opportunity to unravel the true subunit composition of the human complex. Our work brings the number of known subunits of the human TIM22 complex to five: hTim22 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sirrenberg et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bauer et al., 1999</a>), hTim9, hTim10a, hTim10b (<a href=\"#bib34\">M\u00fchlenbein et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gentle et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bauer et al., 1999</a>) and Tim29 (this study). Interestingly, our immunoprecipitations and mass spectrometry data for both hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> and C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> did not reveal the presence of SDHC, suggesting the human protein is not a subunit of the human TIM22 complex, at least under the conditions in which we perform the immunoprecipitation experiments. <a href=\"#bib16\">Gebert et al. (2011)</a> showed that the assembly of yeast Sdh3 at both Complex II and TIM22 is influenced by the formation of different sub-complexes with the highly homologous Sdh4 and Tim18. The Sdh3-Sdh4 and Sdh3-Tim18 subcomplexes subsequently deliver the protein to either Complex II or TIM22, respectively. It is feasible to suggest that the lack of Tim18 in human mitochondria could prevent the association of SDHC to the hTIM22 complex."

Mitochondrial subfractionation and carbonate extraction confirmed that Tim29 is an integral protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Given that there is only one predicted transmembrane region, we propose Tim29 is inserted into the mitochondrial inner membrane via this single transmembrane segment, with its amino-terminus facing the matrix and carboxyl-terminus exposed to the intermembrane space. Interestingly, we confirmed that targeting and proper sorting of Tim29 to the inner membrane relies on the first 89 amino acids of the protein. Although fluorescence microscopy suggested that constructs lacking the first 16 amino acids (Tim29<sup>\u25b316</sup> and Tim29<sup>aa17-89</sup>) could be targeted to mitochondria, closer investigation using mitochondrial subfractionation and carbonate extraction reveals these proteins failed to sort to the inner membrane. Given this observation and that the knockdown of hTim22 did not influence the levels of Tim29, the protein is most likely imported via the TIM23 complex, however this needs to be experimentally verified."

In contrast, hTim23, which is also a substrate for the hTIM22 complex showed an assembly defect both in vitro and at the steady state level. Such a scenario has previously been reported for the yeast TIM22 complex, with deletion of Tim18 differentially affecting the import kinetics of the AAC and Tim23 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kerscher et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Koehler et al., 2000</a>). It is possible that depletion of Tim29 affects the activity of the human TIM23 complex by a more direct mechanism, whereas the import of ANT only requires the TIM22 complex and the residual complex remaining following knockdown is enough to import and assemble the small amounts of radiolabelled protein used in the in vitro import assay."

Given that hTim22 is integrated into the membrane in mitochondria isolated from the Tim29 KD cells, we conclude that Tim29 is required for the assembly of hTim22 into the TIM22 complex. In addition to this role our data indicate that Tim29 facilitates cooperation between the TIM22 and TOM complexes, by directly interacting with hTom40. Cooperation between the TOM and TIM23 complexes is well established in yeast cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chacinska et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Waegemann et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mokranjac et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Popov-\u010celeketi\u0107 et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chacinska et al., 2010</a>), however a similar interaction between the TOM and TIM22 complex has not been reported thus far. We have captured an interaction between the TOM and TIM22 complexes <i>in organello</i> using both Tim29 and hTom22 as bait. Furthermore, using chemical crosslinking we narrowed down specific interactions between: (i) Tim29 and hTim9; (ii) Tim29 and hTim10b; hTim10b and hTim9; and Tim29 and hTom40. We were puzzled to see an interaction between Tim29 and hTom40, since in yeast TIM23 interacts with TOM via Tom22, which exposes a domain into the intermembrane space (<a href=\"#bib49\">Waegemann et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chacinska et al., 2010</a>). However, Shiota and colleagues (2015) recently showed that the intermembrane space chaperone, Tim10 interacts with an N-terminal region of Tom40. This suggests that the N-terminal region of Tom40 extends through the \u03b2-barrel pore into the intermembrane space (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shiota et al., 2015</a>), and such a mechanism could be mediating the interaction between hTom40 and the intermembrane space localised region of Tim29."

Why would a TOM-TIM22 interaction be necessary in human mitochondria? The answer could lie with the nature of the small TIM chaperones within mammalian mitochondria. Early studies by M\u00fchlenbein and colleagues (2004) suggested that human mitochondria lack soluble Tim9-Tim10 complexes, but rather these proteins are more tightly associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. Thus, even though the function of the small TIM proteins has been conserved through evolution, the import of carrier proteins into mammalian mitochondria is efficient even in the absence of soluble Tim9-Tim10 complexes. Therefore, it is likely that other mechanisms have evolved that serve to prevent the hydrophobic carrier proteins from aggregating in the intermembrane space. A close association between the TOM and TIM22 complexes could be one such mechanism. Our data represents a major conceptual advance and challenges the common dogma that carrier proteins are transported across the mitochondrial intermembrane space via soluble intermediates. Further investigation is necessary to tease out the precise role of the TOM-TIM22 interaction and how it is influenced by the presence of precursor protein."

Briefly, the gel bands were subjected to reduction by 10\u2009mM DTT (Bio-Rad), alkylation by 25\u2009mM iodoacetamide (Sigma), tryptic digestion overnight with 150 ng of trypsin (Promega). Subsequently, the tryptic peptides were further extracted using acetonitrile (50% w/v) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%). Extracted tryptic peptides were concentrated to ~10\u2009\u03bcL by centrifugal lyophilisation and analysed by LC-MS/MS using LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) fitted with nanoflow reversed-phase-HPLC (Model 1200, Agilent). MGF files were generated using MSConvert using peak picking. The MGF files were searched against the NCBI RefSeq database (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2085424\">AB_2085424</a>)\u00a0in a target decoy fashion using MASCOT (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2085424\">AB_2085424</a>\u00a0v2.4, Matrix Science, UK). Search parameters used were: fixed modification (carbamidomethylation of cysteine; +57 Da), variable modifications (oxidation of methionine; +16 Da), three missed tryptic cleavages, 20 ppm peptide mass tolerance and 0.6 Da fragment ion mass tolerance. Peptide identifications with mascot ion score greater than the identity score were deemed significant. The relative protein abundance between the samples was obtained by estimating the ratio of normalised spectral counts (RSc) as previously described (<a href=\"#bib23\">Keerthikumar et al., 2015</a>)."

Mitochondrial metabolism critically depends on these solute carrier proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Global metabolic adaptations of mitochondria are cornerstones of cellular development, stress responses and pathophysiological processes, e.g. in cancer cells. In view of that, surprisingly little is known about the TIM22 protein sorting machinery (carrier translocase) that integrates metabolite carriers into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Therefore, the identification and characterization of a novel subunit of the human TIM22 complex presented in this work by Stojanovski and co-workers is of great importance for our understanding of mitochondrial biogenesis and physiology."

Moreover, they provide evidence that Tim29 directly contacts the general preprotein translocase of the outer membrane, the TOM complex, and may thus be involved in the formation of membrane contact sites. This finding represents a major conceptual advance in the field of mitochondrial biogenesis, because it challenges the common dogma that carrier proteins are transported across the mitochondrial intermembrane space via soluble intermediates."
