                    "text": "Several neurodegenerative diseases are driven by the toxic gain-of-function of specific proteins within the brain. Elevated levels of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) appear to drive neurotoxicity in Parkinson's disease (PD); neuronal accumulation of tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD); and their increased levels cause neurodegeneration in humans and model organisms. Despite the clinical differences between AD and PD, several lines of evidence suggest that \u03b1-Syn and tau overlap pathologically. The connections between \u03b1-Syn and tau led us to ask whether these proteins might be regulated through a shared pathway. We therefore screened for genes that affect post-translational levels of \u03b1-Syn and tau. We found that TRIM28 regulates \u03b1-Syn and tau levels and that its reduction rescues toxicity in animal models of tau- and \u03b1-Syn-mediated degeneration. TRIM28 stabilizes and promotes the nuclear accumulation and toxicity of both proteins. Intersecting screens across comorbid proteinopathies thus reveal shared mechanisms and therapeutic entry points."

Elevated levels of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) appear to drive neurotoxicity in Parkinson's disease (PD); neuronal accumulation of tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD); and their increased levels cause neurodegeneration in humans and model organisms. Despite the clinical differences between AD and PD, several lines of evidence suggest that \u03b1-Syn and tau overlap pathologically. The connections between \u03b1-Syn and tau led us to ask whether these proteins might be regulated through a shared pathway. We therefore screened for genes that affect post-translational levels of \u03b1-Syn and tau. We found that TRIM28 regulates \u03b1-Syn and tau levels and that its reduction rescues toxicity in animal models of tau- and \u03b1-Syn-mediated degeneration. TRIM28 stabilizes and promotes the nuclear accumulation and toxicity of both proteins. Intersecting screens across comorbid proteinopathies thus reveal shared mechanisms and therapeutic entry points."

In Parkinson\u2019s disease, the protein alpha-synuclein accumulates; in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the protein tau is one of the toxic culprits; and in other neurodegenerative diseases, alpha-synuclein and tau both accumulate. Genetic studies suggest that accumulation of the two proteins may be linked, but little is known about the factors that regulate the levels of these proteins inside neurons."

Screening a subset of human genes led to one that encodes a protein called TRIM28, which regulates the levels of both alpha-synuclein and tau. When the TRIM28 protein was depleted in human and mouse cells, the levels of alpha-synuclein and tau also went down. This effect was specific because the levels of other proteins with the potential to cause neurodegeneration remained unaffected."

In each case, the proteins\u2019 levels dropped when TRIM28 was suppressed and this in turn protected the neurons from damage. Rousseaux et al. went on to show that TRIM28 affected how alpha-synuclein and tau were cleared in cells. Overexpressing TRIM28 revealed that it could encourage both alpha-synuclein and tau to accumulate in the nucleus of cells over time."

                        "text": "A number of neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the gradual accumulation of specific proteins within neurons. As research on these \u2018proteinopathies\u2019 has progressed, certain unexpected commonalities have arisen. For example, alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn, <i>SNCA</i>) is now thought to mediate neurotoxicity not only in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), but also in Parkinson\u2019s Disease Dementia (PDD) and Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) where it accumulates in Lewy bodies (<a href=\"#bib49\">Spillantini et al., 1997</a>). Similarly, the microtubule associated protein tau (<i>MAPT</i>) accumulates not only in neurons affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), but in PD and PDD, while mutations that increase the stability of tau result in frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism (FTDP-17 (or FTD) [<a href=\"#bib48\">Spillantini and Goedert, 2013</a>]). Coding region mutations in <i>SNCA</i> are by no means necessary for PD to develop given that duplication or triplication of the <i>SNCA</i> locus is sufficient to result in forms of PD whose onset and severity correlate with gene dosage (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chartier-Harlin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ibanez et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Singleton, 2003</a>). Supporting these clinical findings are studies that show that overexpression of wild-type forms of either <i>SNCA</i> or <i>MAPT</i> elicit neurodegeneration in model organisms, whereas suppressing their levels appears to be neuroprotective (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dauer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ishihara et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jackson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rapoport et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rockenstein et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wittmann, 2001</a>). Given the brain\u2019s sensitivity to the dosage of either of these proteins, one would expect elevated levels of multiple proteins to be even more problematic, and this proves to be the case (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moussaud et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "Pathogenic proteins involved in different proteionopathies often interact with each other and cause cellular toxicity, either due to their additive effects on downstream activities or further compromise of protein homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clinton et al., 2010</a>). Abnormally aggregated \u03b1-Syn and tau are often found together in postmortem cases of PD and LBD (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arima et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Colom-Cadena et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Iseki et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ishizawa et al., 2003</a>), and genetic interaction studies in <i>Drosophila</i> demonstrate that \u03b1-Syn and tau synergize in promoting toxicity (<a href=\"#bib43\">Roy and Jackson, 2014</a>). Biochemical evidence even suggests that \u03b1-Syn may act as an amyloidogenic \u2018seed\u2019 for the accumulation of tau, and vice versa (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sengupta et al., 2015</a>). Even more, several genome-wide association studies have reported genetic interaction between tau and alpha-synuclein in PD pathogenesis (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sim\u00f3n-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2009</a>). Thus, the interaction between tau and \u03b1-synuclein is gaining increased attention for its possible pathogenic role in synucleinopathies and tauopathies. The mechanisms governing the dual accumulation of \u03b1-Syn and tau remain elusive, but it seems plausible that decreasing levels of either or both of these proteins could prove an effective therapeutic strategy for this family of diseases."

Therefore, convergent screens to find common modulators for \u03b1-Syn and tau levels would yield the most insight into these disease processes and possibly open up new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Importantly, targeting the root cause of the disease \u2013 protein accumulation \u2013 in an unbiased manner makes neither assumption about the mechanism of toxicity nor which cellular process is affected. Through convergent RNAi screens targeting the steady-state levels of \u03b1-Syn and tau, we found that TRIM28 regulates their levels and toxicity through their toxic nuclear accumulation."

We ran parallel screens interrogating 2607 siRNAs targeting 869 potentially druggable \u2013 i.e. potentially can be targeted pharmacologically \u2013 genes to identify genes that modify the levels of both \u03b1-Syn and tau (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>).

In addition, we found that deleting one allele of <i>Trim28</i> in mice led to a modest but significant decrease of \u03b1-Syn and tau levels in mouse brain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

For a tauopathy model, we generated transgenic <i>Drosophila</i> that express wild-type human tau in the eye and develop a visible degenerative phenotype.

We co-injected lentiviral vectors expressing \u03b1-Syn together with a lentiviral vector expressing an shRNA against mouse <i>Trim28</i> into the <i>Substantia Nigra pars compacta</i>(SNc) of mice and evaluated dopaminergic cell integrity eight weeks afterward. Mice infected with viruses overexpressing \u03b1-Syn and a control shRNA suffered a 50% reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a><b>-top panels</b> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Remarkably, mice that received the <i>shTrim28</i> virus together with \u03b1-Syn overexpression maintained their dopaminergic cells in the SNc and the corresponding fibers in the striatum (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a><b>-bottom panels</b>). We confirmed that <i>Trim28</i> was expressed (and effectively knocked down in the case of <i>shTrim28</i> treatment) in these nigral neurons and that this rescue was due to a decrease in \u03b1-Syn levels and not the silencing of the \u03b1-Syn expression vector (measured by IRES-driven GFP expression, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

These mice possess a transgene driving wildtype \u03b1-Syn under the control of the mThy1 promoter and demonstrate age-dependent accumulation and aggregation of \u03b1-Syn that is demarked by its S129 phosphorylated form.

                                "text": "Since loss of TRIM28 rescued the neurodegenerative phenotypes, we surmised that increasing TRIM28 might exacerbate pathology. We performed bilateral lentiviral overexpression of TRIM28 in pre-symptomatic mouse models of synucleinopathy (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rockenstein et al., 2002</a>) and tauopathy (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yoshiyama et al., 2007</a>) and found that injection with TRIM28, but not control lentivirus, worsened each aspect of neuropathology tested in both models (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>; and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). We were particularly intrigued to find pathological, phosphorylated, forms of \u03b1-Syn (S129) and tau (S396) accumulating at this earlier stage. Given the efficacy of TRIM28 at tightly regulating the levels of \u03b1-Syn and tau in a post-translational manner, we reasoned that TRIM28 was likely stabilizing these proteins therefore promoting their toxic accumulation. To test this, we generated doxycycline-inducible cell lines where we could carefully assess the half-lives of \u03b1-Syn and tau without altering global protein homeostasis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib33\">Meerbrey et al., 2011</a>). Specifically, we cloned wild-type \u03b1-Syn and tau into doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vectors (pINDUCER system), infected SH-SY5Y cells and selected for clones that stably express either \u03b1-Syn or tau upon induction. We found that the half-lives of \u03b1-Syn and tau (measured following a 48 hr pulse of doxycycline) in this system resembled those previously observed by others (23.3 hr for \u03b1-Syn and 28.1 hr for tau [<a href=\"#bib32\">Li, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Min et al., 2010</a>]). Importantly, we found that TRIM28 lentiviral overexpression could significantly increase the half-life of each protein by approximately 50% (LV-TRIM28 vs. LV-Ctrl, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>), without affecting their RNA stability (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together, these studies suggest that TRIM28 promotes the accumulation of the amyloidogenic proteins \u03b1-Syn and tau."

We generated stable cell lines expressing N-terminal YFP tagged versions of \u03b1-Syn and tau (nYFP-\u03b1-Syn and nYFP-tau). By themselves, the cell lines did not generate any fluorescence (data not shown) but when a known interactor of each (in this case, tau) was co-transfected as a prey, we could elicit a strong fluorescent signal (tested by flow cytometry). We found that using TRIM28 as a prey could elicit a signal roughly eight times lower than that of tau thus confirming the transiency of the interaction. Intriguingly, TRIM28:\u03b1-Syn and TRIM28:tau complexes accumulated in nuclei after some time. To confirm that this effect was not an artifact of the BiFC approach, we overexpressed a mCherry-fused TRIM28 lentiviral construct in primary cerebellar granule neurons and looked at the endogenous localization of \u03b1-Syn and tau. Again, both by immunofluorescence and by biochemical fractionation, we found that viral expression of TRIM28 dramatically promoted the nuclear accumulation of these two proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Given our previous data suggesting that the effects of TRIM28 on \u03b1-Syn and tau are posttranslational, we explored whether the RING domain of TRIM28 might play a role in its modulatory effect. To this end, we focused on the known E3-ligase catalytic activity of TRIM28. We overexpressed an inactive TRIM28 E3 ligase mutant ([C65A/C68A], \u2018<i>TRIM28-Mut</i>\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Doyle et al., 2010</a>) and found that this mutant could no longer promote the toxic nuclear accumulation of these proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, we found that the TRIM28 E3 ligase mutant, while less stable, could still bind \u03b1-Syn and tau (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that its effect on \u03b1-Syn and tau nuclear accumulation is functionally, rather than structurally, driven. Taken together, TRIM28 governs the nuclear accumulation of \u03b1-Syn and tau through its E3-ligase domain, and its persistent expression aggravates the neuropathology of both proteins."

We therefore obtained post-mortem tissue from individuals who had had PDD, AD, or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), along with age-matched controls, and examined the biochemical distribution of TRIM28. In all cases of synucleinopathy and tauopathy, a greater proportion of TRIM28 accumulated in an insoluble form (Formic Acid fraction) than the more soluble form (RIPA fraction) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Subcellular fractionation on these post-mortem tissues revealed that \u03b1-Syn and tau accumulated in the nucleus in most cases of synucleinopathy and tauopathy (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Then, we looked at \u03b1-Syn and tau subcellular localization in relation to TRIM28 in the context of PD and AD, respectively. We found that \u03b1-Syn and tau nuclear co-localization with TRIM28 was greater in PD and AD than in age-matched controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>).

                        "text": "The mechanism(s) underlying the neurotoxicity of \u03b1-Syn and tau have been difficult to pin down (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cookson and van der Brug, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ward et al., 2012</a>). Although accumulating evidence suggests that \u03b1-Syn and tau pathology propagate from cell to cell, the exact mechanism driving their initial accumulation and toxicity remains unclear. Given that both \u03b1-Syn and tau accumulate in Parkinson Disease Dementia and Lewy Body Dementia (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moussaud et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sengupta et al., 2015</a>), we rationalized that there must be some proteins that regulate both of them. Thus, when screening for posttranslational regulators that modulate the levels of each protein, we were most interested in regulators that can modify the levels of both \u03b1-Syn and tau. Through such convergent screens, we found that TRIM28 regulates the levels of both disease-driving proteins. Our finding that TRIM28 regulates \u03b1-Syn and tau by promoting their nuclear localization and accumulation dovetails nicely with studies indicating that altered cellular distribution of \u03b1-Syn and tau contributes to neurodegeneration (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fares et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Nogales et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kontopoulos et al., 2006</a>). Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that mislocalization or missorting of \u03b1-Syn and tau as a result of mutations, post-translational modification or overexpression, rather than their respective aggregation in the form of Lewy bodies and NFTs, are what promotes neurodegeneration (<a href=\"#bib19\">Frandemiche et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wilson et al., 2004</a>). For instance, \u03b1-Syn is much more toxic in a fly model of synucleinopathy when it is tagged with a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kontopoulos et al., 2006</a>). Further, PD-causing mutations in \u03b1-Syn increase its nuclear accumulation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fares et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kontopoulos et al., 2006</a>). Moreover, postmortem studies of tissue from AD and Huntington disease patients indicate that misfolded tau accumulates in the nucleus of neurons in the form of rod-like deposits (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Nogales et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Vuono et al., 2015</a>). Our finding that TRIM28 drives the nuclear accumulation of \u03b1-Syn and tau provides new mechanistic insight into the steps that lead to the pathogenicity of these proteins and highlights a shared pathway for therapeutic targeting."

                        "text": "The molecular mechanism through which TRIM28 stabilizes and mediates the nuclear localization of \u03b1-Syn and tau is not elucidated at this point. Indeed, it is possible that TRIM28 mediates its effects on \u03b1-Syn and tau indirectly through a yet undiscovered mediator, through epigenetic remodeling or indirect binding and/or modification of an intermediate (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng, 2014</a>). However, the evidence we present suggests that this less likely of a mechanism. For instance, we show that TRIM28 does not affect the RNA of \u03b1-Syn and tau but rather their protein stability. Moreover, we show that TRIM28 can form a complex with the two proteins and that its effect on nuclear accumulation is mediated via its E3-ligase domain. This would therefore suggest that TRIM28 may mediate this effect through SUMOylation or ubiquitination. Since SUMOylation has previously been suggested to mediate the nuclear localization of certain proteins, we hypothesize that TRIM28 acting as a SUMO ligase for \u03b1-Syn and tau. Future studies will dissect such a mechanism through the use of genetically engineered mice that permit monitoring of either modification in vivo."

This finding is particularly encouraging when it comes to therapeutics as it suggests that only partially inhibiting TRIM28 function may be effective at blocking neurotoxicity. Moreover, having discovered that mutating the E3 ligase catalytic activity of TRIM28 effectively is sufficient to regulate \u03b1-Syn and tau levels and for this specific effect behaves like a null allele, narrows down a target domain within TRIM28 for inhibition. This finding sets the stage for future studies to dissect the native function of the E3 ligase domain of TRIM28 versus its other essential domains and provides a potential opportunity for targeting TRIM28 as a source of therapy for these debilitating disorders."

While we found that both \u03b1-Syn and tau co-localized with TRIM28 in the nucleus in cases of PD and AD, respectively, it was also interesting to find that TRIM28 accumulated in the insoluble biochemical fractions from post-mortem tissue. Moreover, though TRIM28 accumulation occurs in both diseases, irrespective of the driving pathological protein, \u03b1-Syn and tau appeared to more selectively accumulate in the nucleus in the context of their respective disease. Teasing out the precise mechanisms that affect TRIM28 accumulation as well as \u03b1-Syn and tau nuclear localization in human tissue will provide additional context for the understanding of disease pathogenesis."

Please see <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>\u00a0for full demographics and pathological analysis. Frozen tissue was either fractionated as per the protocol above or was alternatively processed for biochemical fractionation. In the latter case, each sample was homogenized in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors using a dilution of brain: RIPA of 1:10 (w/v). Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were portioned into aliquots, snap-frozen, and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. The pellets were then resuspended in 88% formic acid to solubilize aggregate/insoluble protein for one hour at room temperature. Samples were then diluted to 22% in PBS and lyophilized overnight using a Savant automatic environmental speedvac system (Aes1010). Pellets were then solubilized in the same volume as the original RIPA volume and subsequently sonicated at output 2 for 30 cycles on a Branson sonicator. Independent blocks of frozen tissue were cut from PD, AD and control subjects for immunofluorescence analysis (10 \u00b5m sections)."

The\u00a0sample size was chosen based on previous studies using the models described in the study in order to ensure adequate statistical power. Pre-determined exclusion criteria were used in the nuclear/cytoplasmic biochemical fractionation by determining purity of the prep. If the fractionation was not adequate (as per Lamin A, Histone H3, GAPDH and Vinculin levels), sample was re-fractionated or omitted from the study. Tissue sections with high background staining/staining artifacts were removed and/or re-stained for the analysis. Randomization together with blinding was used for histological quantification as well as human case studies. Randomization was done using Microsoft Excel and blinding was performed by assigning new non-descript codes to cases. Unblinding was only done following analysis. Outliers for histology were removed if there was a\u00a0lack of detectable viral expression in the animal and if the sample met the Grubb\u2019s outlier test p-value. p values were determined using the appropriate statistical method via GraphPad Prism, as described throughout the manuscript. For simple comparisons, two-tailed Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test was used whereas for multiple comparisons, ANOVA followed by the appropriate <i>post hoc</i> analysis were utilized.

Overall, looking at the biochemical data we do not see a clear increase in overall TRIM28 levels under disease conditions. The authors indeed find a statistically significant shift of TRIM28 to the insoluble form in these conditions, but we wonder how TRIM28 could participate in actively bringing \u03b1-Synuclein/Tau into the nucleus if it's bound up in aggregates, presumable inactive. By staining (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), the nuclear localization of TRIM28 in both control and disease patient brain also makes us wonder how TRIM28 would access these cytosolic proteins to bring them into the nucleus. Moreover, when looking at individual human samples in the biochemistry provided in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, there is no clear correlation between TRIM28 levels and \u03b1-Synuclein/Tau levels; For example, in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, Panel C, right, the up/down levels of TRIM28 in the insoluble fraction does not correlate with the increase/decrease of phospho-Tau levels of the same patient. Perhaps in an earlier disease stage the data would make more sense. Overall it seems the human data is not as black-and-white as the more conclusive animal model data presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a> and the manuscript should be modified to make the conclusions more modest."

They did this by expressing a mutant version of TRIM28 that has two cysteine mutations in the ring domain. As these cysteines play a structural role in the ring domain, these mutations could disrupt the overall folding/conformation of this domain. It is important to determine if mutant versions of TRIM28 still interacts with tau and synuclein. This would be an important experiment to distinguish between ligase-dependent mechanisms of regulation versus physical binding and recruitment to the nuclear compartment. If binding is lost it would be difficult to conclude more than that interactions are important."

This result is interesting. But could it just be that TRIM28 becomes trapped in insoluble nuclear complexes with synuclein and tau in disease brains? I am not sure I see a link that is necessarily causal. Can the authors discuss why an increase in number of nuclei with TRIM28, synuclein and tau should be taken to indicate that TRIM28 is driving the process rather than being carried along for the ride as an interacting protein?"

Importantly, the number of TH positive neurons decreases in the presence of synuclein, and this is reversed following RNAi of TRIM28.

I just point this out because if translation is not inhibited (there is no evidence that cyclohexamide was used to block translation in the half life experiments), there could be effects on protein abundance over time that are translational, and would otherwise be scored as alterations in protein half-life.</i> "

They did this by expressing a mutant version of TRIM28 that has two cysteine mutations in the ring domain. As these cysteines play a structural role in the ring domain, these mutations could disrupt the overall folding/conformation of this domain. It is important to determine if mutant versions of TRIM28 still interacts with tau and synuclein. This would be an important experiment to distinguish between ligase-dependent mechanisms of regulation versus physical binding and recruitment to the nuclear compartment. If binding is lost it would be difficult to conclude more than that interactions are important.</i> "
