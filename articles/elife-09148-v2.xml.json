Here, we show that texture discrimination can be artificially provided in human subjects by implementing a neuromorphic real-time mechano-neuro-transduction (MNT), which emulates to some extent the firing dynamics of SA1 cutaneous afferents. The MNT process was used to modulate the temporal pattern of electrical spikes delivered to the human median nerve via percutaneous microstimulation in four intact subjects and via implanted intrafascicular stimulation in one transradial amputee. Both approaches allowed the subjects to reliably discriminate spatial coarseness of surfaces as confirmed also by a hybrid neural model of the median nerve. Moreover, MNT-evoked EEG activity showed physiologically plausible responses that were superimposable in time and topography to the ones elicited by a natural mechanical tactile stimulation. These findings can open up novel opportunities for sensory restoration in the next generation of neuro-prosthetic hands."

Raffaele Pisana (Rome), where the experiments were performed, the Ethics Committee of Campus Bio-Medico University and the Italian Ministry of Health. Four intact subjects (2 males and 2 females, 25-26 years old) underwent the experiments of texture discrimination with tactile feedback elicited by a stimulation injected through two microneurographic electrodes (FHC UNP40GAS, shaped as needles). The enrolment was subjected to signing a written Informed Consent, approved by the Campus Bio-Medico University Ethics Committee, where this set of experiments took place."

Here, we show that texture discrimination can be artificially provided in human subjects by implementing a neuromorphic real-time mechano-neuro-transduction (MNT), which emulates to some extent the firing dynamics of SA1 cutaneous afferents. The MNT process was used to modulate the temporal pattern of electrical spikes delivered to the human median nerve via percutaneous microstimulation in four intact subjects and via implanted intrafascicular stimulation in one transradial amputee. Both approaches allowed the subjects to reliably discriminate spatial coarseness of surfaces as confirmed also by a hybrid neural model of the median nerve. Moreover, MNT-evoked EEG activity showed physiologically plausible responses that were superimposable in time and topography to the ones elicited by a natural mechanical tactile stimulation. These findings can open up novel opportunities for sensory restoration in the next generation of neuro-prosthetic hands."

Raffaele Pisana (Rome), where the experiments were performed, the Ethics Committee of Campus Bio-Medico University and the Italian Ministry of Health. Four intact subjects (2 males and 2 females, 25-26 years old) underwent the experiments of texture discrimination with tactile feedback elicited by a stimulation injected through two microneurographic electrodes (FHC UNP40GAS, shaped as needles). The enrolment was subjected to signing a written Informed Consent, approved by the Campus Bio-Medico University Ethics Committee, where this set of experiments took place."

While commercial prostheses can mimic the range of movements of natural limbs, even the latest experimental prostheses have only a limited ability to \u2018feel\u2019 the objects being manipulated.

This volunteer could also identify the different textures the artificial fingertip touched, with a slightly higher degree of accuracy than the previous group of intact volunteers. Further studies are now required to explore the potential of this approach in larger groups of volunteers."

This achievement will allow the \u201csymbiosis\u201d between the user and interface to become more adaptive (to changing tasks and situations), more robust (beyond interfering stimuli), more effective (learn from the past to anticipate or predict the future), and more natural (rapidly becoming part of the body scheme).

In this framework, the temporal coding of tactile information was based on the use of a biologically plausible neural model (<a href=\"#bib23\">Izhikevich, 2003</a>) , which has shown promise as a versatile and computationally efficient framework for reproducing a wide range of phenomenological neural responses to stimuli."

In fact, percutaneous needle microstimulation of peripheral nerves cannot be used in amputees as part of an effective long-term assistive device because a stable needle-to-fibers spatial relationship cannot be maintained in a moving limb. Therefore, its use can only be limited to a single experimental session lasting a few hours at most (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vallbo et al., 2004</a>). Instead, implantable neural interfaces, such as Transverse Intrafascicular Multichannel Electrodes (TIMEs) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boretius et al., 2010</a>) , are surgically positioned and firmly stabilized to adhere to nerve fascicles and do not require an arm rest compared with needle interfaces. Therefore, implantable neural interfaces are suitable for long-term implants. In this study, we developed a novel computational model to investigate the similarities between neural effects, such as in afferent nerve recruitment curves, achieved using microstimulation with percutaneous needles and with TIME neural interfaces. This comparison allowed verification of the possibility of extending the results achieved using percutaneous needle stimulation to TIMEs."

The range of tested tactile stimuli in the current work is on the order of millimeters (0.5\u20133.0 mm). Thus, these stimuli pertain to the lower boundary (towards the fine region) of stimuli that are typically classified as coarse (<a href=\"#bib71\">Weber et al., 2013</a>)."

The model, which takes into account realistic anatomical (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jabaley et al., 1980</a>) and neurophysiological (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vallbo et al., 1984</a>) data, indicated that the stimulated portion of axonal population (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), and, therefore, the type of sensation, together with the stimulation threshold (statistically non-different: p&gt;0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test) were similar for the two interfaces. The range of electric charge necessary for recruitment in both cases was comparable (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

To understand how the very good surface discrimination, which was shown both by intact subjects with microstimulation and by DAS with the TIME implant, was achieved (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>), we tested which neural features correlated with the difference of SPs. During the conditions of constant sliding velocity (10 mm/s) and regulated load force (400 mN), the periodic contact between the sensor and the texture ridges generated regular patterns in the sensor output. The spiking response was given by a sequence of bursts of reliable duration, time-locked to the alternation of ridges and grooves during the sliding motion of gratings (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). This suggested that the Inter Burst Interval (IBI, illustrated in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10a</a>), given by the temporal distance between the onset of consecutives bursts, might characterize the response to each texture. Indeed, the MNT process led to linear correlation between the stimulus SP of each texture and a highly specific IBI (ANOVA test, Tukey Kramer correction for multiple comparisons, p&lt;0.00001) reproducing neurophysiological findings in non-human (<a href=\"#bib7\">Darian-Smith et al., 1980a</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Phillips and Johnson, 1981</a>) and human (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oddo et al., 2011b</a>) primate studies with similar gratings. Consequently, the difference in IBI between the MNT output that was elicited by the two sides of each stimulus correlated almost perfectly (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.997) with the difference in SP (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9d</a>). Additionally, the behavioral responses of DAS were perfectly (R\u00a0=\u00a01) fit by a logistic function of the difference in IBI."

However, they do not rule out the possibility that the responses were based simply on the count of the total number of spikes injected during each stimulus. Then, we tested whether a rate code not taking into account the temporal structure of the response was able to lead to comparable discrimination of stimuli as the one observed behaviorally. A commonly accepted definition of a rate code is the count of spikes within the time frame of encoding window (<a href=\"#bib61\">Theunissen and Miller, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Panzeri et al., 2010</a>) which in our case is assumed to be the 2 s presentation of each stimulus. Then, the sensor response to each stimulus, based on which we performed the IBI-based analysis, was also quantified by measuring the overall average firing rate (AFR), i.e., the ratio between the total number of spikes emitted during the sliding and the (fixed) 2\u2009s sliding duration. We found that the AFRs generated in response to different SPs were often similar because a larger IBI was associated with a more intense bursting activity (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). In particular, the AFRs of responses to 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mm were not significantly different, and the AFRs of responses to 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm were not significantly different (p&lt;0.05 ANOVA test with multiple comparisons). Consequently, the difference \u0394AFR in AFR between the two sides of a stimulus correlated very weakly with the difference between their SP (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.066 for \u0394AFR vs R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.997 for \u0394IBI, compare <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9e</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9d</a>). Note that no logistic function of the difference in AFR was able to fit DAS behavioral responses (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.04, p\u00a0=\u00a00.8), which was a significant contrast with the perfect fit achieved with \u0394IBI. Therefore, because the total spike count was not able to encode differences between stimuli to a degree compatible with behavioral responses, we concluded that the rate code was not responsible for the subject perception of the presented textures. This further strengthens the hypothesis that the subject exploited the temporal structure of the response to discriminate the stimuli."

It is apparent that the temporal evolution of the instantaneous firing rate matches the alternation of ridges and grooves. Indeed, it is already known that, when sliding occurs at fixed velocity, the temporal structure of the sensor output is a linear transformation of the spatial structure of the texture (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oddo et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">2011c</a>) , at least for regular textures such as those considered here. Therefore, this is a case of temporal coding of the stimulus (<a href=\"#bib61\">Theunissen and Miller, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Borst and Theunissen, 1999</a>) : the temporal evolution of the spiking response reflects the time evolution of the stimulus rather than internal dynamics of stimulus encoding. Because the spatial structure is highly regular and the textures primarily differ for a single spatial variable (the SP), it is possible to discriminate between them using the corresponding single temporal variable (the IBI). Then, this may be the feature of the injected spike trains that allows subjects to precisely decode the presented stimuli."

Additionally, reconstruction of tactile sensation of force levels and object shape was shown using multi-electrode stimulation via pulses with current amplitude linearly increasing with sensor outputs (<a href=\"#bib54\">Raspopovic, 2014</a>). In contrast, this work focused on eliciting textural features by injecting a biomimetic (<a href=\"#bib57\">Saal and Bensmaia, 2015</a>) temporal structure of pulse trains with a fixed current amplitude in each experimental session. Discrimination of textural features is a remarkable skill of our somatosensory system, which is used in everyday activities to interact with a peri-personal space. The subjects that use hand prostheses will significantly benefit from the restoration of this sensory function, which represents the next desirable feature after recent achievements (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Raspopovic, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ortiz-Catalan et al., 2014</a>).

In such passive-touch framework there is a lack of voluntary movement.

In fact, the relationship between IBI and behavioral performance seems to indicate that responses of subject DAS were based on temporal structures of the injected stimuli (which, due to the linearity of our MNT process in mapping the geometry of stimuli, correspond to temporal modulation in the spiking activity captured by the IBI for regular textures), rather than on their average firing rate alone.

Electrodes were pulled inside the nerve, until the embedded active contacts reached the targeted location, close in contact with the nerve fascicles. Cable segments were placed in subcutaneous pockets, while four holes were made in close proximity of the skin incision, two medially and two laterally for the electrode emission (<a href=\"#bib54\">Raspopovic, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Di Pino et al., 2014</a>)."

Furthermore, nodal length was fixed at 1 \u03bcm and nodal diameter scaled from a previous study (<a href=\"#bib36\">McIntyre et al., 2002</a>). A list of plausible assumptions had to be taken, during the model construction. The sensory axon populations were constructed (NEURON, USA) by using a probabilistic distribution of fibers diameters (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</a>) for different tactile units of the human hand, resulting in two Gaussian distributions which differentiate nociceptive fibers from fibers responsible for pressure/touch sensation, and the latter was used. One of the assumptions constraining the model was that the stimulation of different fiber types, such as nociceptive fibers, was not induced, at used current range. A total amount of 100 modeled fibers for each fascicle were placed randomly in the specific target fascicle, for several placements (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), as explained in continuation. As the fiber organization within different fascicles in the nerve is unknown, we assumed that fibers within one fascicle innervate the same hand area (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jabaley et al., 1980</a>) (i.e., the fibers in one fascicle are innervating a single finger tip and not many of them). Moreover, since there is an inherent anatomical uncertainty in placement and extension of fibers innervating a specific hand district, for every position of stimulating electrode/needle we implemented 9 populations having different extensions and centroids for the same large fascicle (i.e., spanning from having the whole fascicle uniformly populated, to the case of very concentrated population where the fibers are almost touching each-other, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Then the analysis has been performed for the range of significant fascicle sizes, defined as median size representatives of three groups: small (1 population implemented), medium (5 populations implemented) and large (9 populations). Different device placements were also studied: within, close, or far from fascicle, finally resulting in n\u00a0=\u00a090 simulations for TIME and n\u00a0=\u00a045 simulations cases for microneedle (this is because for every position of needle tip there are 2 corresponding positions of TIME: left and right)."

The whole structure was insulated and had electrical conductivity of 6.67 10\u201314 S/m and the tip was non-insulated with a conductivity of 1.89 10<sup>7</sup> S/m. Since in the case of microstimulation needle the tip was un-insulated by the neurologist, imminently before the insertion, the precise un-insulated cone dimension is not known. In order to account for this uncertainty, two models were implemented and the results analyzed for both (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). The TIME electrode was built as a rectangular structure where seven circled active sites were placed in each side of the structure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Conductivity of the polyimide substrate was set to 6.67 10\u201314 S/m. The radius for the active sites was 40 \u03bcm and the thickness 300 nm. The overall structure had 4 mm length, 0.35 mm width and 20 \u03bcm thickness.

The text and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> discuss the results of the study in terms of the overall success rate. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> shows the breakdown of the responses by subject. There is a conspicuous lack of analysis of the data. The data should be analyzed not by lumping together all of the subjects and reporting an aggregate successful discrimination rate, but rather by individual subject as a function of stimulus type. The coarser the stimulus, the greater the discriminatory power and the weaker the stimulus the less the discriminatory power. There should be an analysis showing that the performance by individual is greater than what would be expected by chance, where chance here is 0.33. If there is an approximate monotone relation among the stimuli then a logistic regression analysis could be performed. The analysis should be conducted using confidence intervals or Bayesian methods and not just simply by reporting p-values. An advantage of a Bayesian hierarchical analysis or a random effects model across subjects is that they provide a formal way of pooling information across subjects. The latter is crucial for this problem because the authors which to establish that they have been able to provide neuromorphically tactile sensation. This statement should be made with an assessment of the accuracy of the discriminatory power of the MNT technique for each subject as a function of stimulus type. It is likely that the results will reveal that more trials will be required to show that there is truly discriminatory capability."

The periodicity is instead a direct consequence of the experimented stimuli, which are periodic gratings and explored with constant velocity. Hence, the spatial structure of gratings is transduced in a temporal sequence that maps the textural/geometrical features of the stimuli. The capability of the implemented model to generalize with daily life naturalistic stimuli (either macroscopically aperiodic, such as latex and velvet, or with a fine periodic structure such as textiles) was recently demonstrated in a fully-robotic artificial touch study (Rongala et al., 2015), and such set of stimuli will be evaluated in the future protocols with amputees and chronically-implanted neural interfaces."

There, the delivery of current pulses to the nerve had a fixed frequency and duration within each session and was modulated in amplitude, thus temporal coding had not been implemented. In such case the number of afferent fibers recruited grew monotonically with the stimulation charge and hence the perceived force modulates accordingly, as discussed in a recent review (Saal and Bensmaia, 2015). Conversely, in the present study percepts about textural features were induced modulating the temporal structure of the spiking activity delivered through the nerve without modulating the pulses amplitude (nor the pure firing rate as shown by the analysis of <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D-E</a> in the manuscript)."

Significance is particularly evident in the results with the amputee subject, since the chronically-implanted interface allowed carrying out a quite high number of trials, whereas the percutaneous electrical microstimulation in intact subjects is a technique prone to interruption due to the possible sudden loss of contact between the electrode and the nerve.

As the fiber organization within different fascicles in the nerve is unknown, we assumed that fibers within single fascicles belong to the same functionality. Moreover, since there is an inherent anatomical uncertainty in their placement and extension, for every position of stimulating electrode/needle we implemented nine populations having different extensions and centroids for the same fascicle (i.e., spanning from having the whole fascicle uniformly populated, to the case of very concentrated population where the fibers are almost touching each-other, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> of the manuscript, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is carried out since a-priori it is unknown whether the population of interest is concentrated in the small portion of a fascicle, or possibly uniformly distributed over it, and by simulating different populations placement we are emulating the inherent biological variability. Then the analysis has been performed for wide range of cases (for small, medium and big fascicles, with devices placed within, close, or far away from it), finally resulting in n=90 simulations for TIME and n=45 simulations cases for microneedle (this difference is due to the fact that in every position implemented for one needle tip the TIME electrode had 2 sites: right and left ones, at the same position)."
