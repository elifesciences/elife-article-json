Here, we reconstituted an autophagy-regulated secretion of mature IL-1\u03b2 (m-IL-1\u03b2) in non-macrophage cells. We found that cytoplasmic IL-1\u03b2 associates with the autophagosome and m-IL-1\u03b2 enters into the lumen of a vesicle intermediate but not into the cytoplasmic interior formed by engulfment of the autophagic membrane. In advance of secretion, m-IL-1\u03b2 appears to be translocated across a membrane in an event that may require m-IL-1\u03b2 to be unfolded or remain conformationally flexible and is dependent on two KFERQ-like motifs essential for the association of IL-1\u03b2 with HSP90. A vesicle, possibly a precursor of the phagophore, contains translocated m-IL-1\u03b2 and later turns into an autophagosome in which m-IL-1\u03b2 resides within the intermembrane space of the double-membrane structure. Completion of IL-1\u03b2 secretion requires Golgi reassembly and stacking proteins (GRASPs) and multi-vesicular body (MVB) formation."

Here, we reconstituted an autophagy-regulated secretion of mature IL-1\u03b2 (m-IL-1\u03b2) in non-macrophage cells. We found that cytoplasmic IL-1\u03b2 associates with the autophagosome and m-IL-1\u03b2 enters into the lumen of a vesicle intermediate but not into the cytoplasmic interior formed by engulfment of the autophagic membrane. In advance of secretion, m-IL-1\u03b2 appears to be translocated across a membrane in an event that may require m-IL-1\u03b2 to be unfolded or remain conformationally flexible and is dependent on two KFERQ-like motifs essential for the association of IL-1\u03b2 with HSP90. A vesicle, possibly a precursor of the phagophore, contains translocated m-IL-1\u03b2 and later turns into an autophagosome in which m-IL-1\u03b2 resides within the intermembrane space of the double-membrane structure. Completion of IL-1\u03b2 secretion requires Golgi reassembly and stacking proteins (GRASPs) and multi-vesicular body (MVB) formation."

A biologically inactive 31\u2009kDa precursor, pro-IL-1\u03b2, is made following initiation of the NF-\u03baB signaling cascade. Pro-IL-1\u03b2 is subsequently converted into the active form, the 17\u2009kDa mature IL-1\u03b2, by the pro-inflammatory protease caspase-1 which is activated, in response to extracellular stimuli, after its recruitment to a multi-protein complex called the inflammasome (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burns et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cerretti et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rathinam et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Thornberry et al., 1992</a>). Interpretation of the mechanism of unconventional secretion of IL-1\u03b2 is complicated by the fact that one of the physiologic reservoirs of this cytokine, macrophages, undergoes pyroptotic death and cell lysis under conditions of inflammasome activation of caspase-1. Indeed, many reports including two recent publications make the case for cell lysis as a means of release of mature IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Shirasaki et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, other reports demonstrate proper secretion of mature IL-1\u03b2 without cell lysis in, for example, neutrophils, which are nonetheless dependent on the inflammasome response to activate caspase-1 and secrete mature IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2014</a>)."

The process is characterized by the formation of a double-membrane vesicle, called the autophagosome, through the elongation and closure of a cup-shaped membrane precursor, termed the phagophore, to engulf cytoplasmic cargoes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hamasaki et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lamb et al., 2013</a>).

Besides the degradative function, autophagy or ATG proteins have recently been implicated in multiple secretory pathways including the delivery of leaderless cargoes undergoing unconventional secretion, such as the mammalian pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, the nuclear factor HMGB1, and the yeast acyl coenzyme A-binding protein Acb1, to the extracellular space (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bruns et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dupont et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Duran et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Manjithaya and Subramani, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pfeffer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Subramani and Malhotra, 2013</a>).

Here, we sought to understand how conditions of starvation-induced autophagy could localize IL-1\u03b2 into an autophagosomal membrane. We reconstituted the autophagy-regulated secretion of IL-1\u03b2 in cultured cell lines and detected a vesicle intermediate, possibly an autophagosome precursor, containing mature IL-1\u03b2. Three-dimensional (3D) Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) demonstrated that, after entering into the autophagosome, IL-1\u03b2 colocalizes with LC3 on the autophagosomal membrane, which, together with an antibody accessibility assay and observations from biochemical assays, implies a topological distribution in the intermembrane space of the autophagosome. This distribution of IL-1\u03b2 explains the mechanism accounting for its secretion as a soluble protein through either a direct fusion of autophagosome with the plasma membrane or via the MVB pathway."

On one hand, induction of autophagy directly promotes IL-1\u03b2 secretion after inflammasome activation by incorporating it into the autophagosomal carrier (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dupont et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, autophagy indirectly dampens IL-1\u03b2 secretion by degrading components of the inflammasome as well as reducing endogenous triggers for inflammasome assembly, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damaged components, which are required for the activation of caspase-1 and the production of active IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Harris et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nakahira et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Shi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>)."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, the generation and secretion (~5%) of mature IL-1\u03b2 (m-IL-1\u03b2) was achieved by co-expression of p-IL-1\u03b2 and p-caspase-1 in HEK293T cells. Mature IL-1\u03b2 was not produced or secreted without p-caspase-1, whereas a low level of secreted p-IL-1\u03b2 (~0.2%) was detected with or without the expression of p-caspase-1. Furthermore, little cell lysis occurred during the treatment we used to induce IL-1\u03b2 secretion: Much less precursor than mature IL-1\u03b2 and little cytoplasmic tubulin was detected released into the cell supernatant during the 2\u2009hr incubation in starvation medium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Starvation, a condition that stimulates autophagy, enhanced IL-1\u03b2 secretion (~3 fold) and reduced the level of IL-1\u03b2 in the cell lysates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Inhibition of autophagy by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or wortmannin (Wtm) blocked IL-1\u03b2 secretion activated by starvation and caused the accumulation of mature IL-1\u03b2 in the cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Likewise, in an autophagy-deficient cell line, Atg5 knockout (KO) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mizushima et al., 2001</a>), IL-1\u03b2 secretion was reduced and failed to respond to starvation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Moreover, IL-1\u03b2 secretion was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of an ATG4B mutant (C74A) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fujita et al., 2008</a>), or after the depletion of ATG2A and B (<a href=\"#bib71\">Velikkakath et al., 2012</a>), or FIP200 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hara et al., 2008</a>), which block autophagosome biogenesis at different stages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). Therefore, the reconstituted system recapitulates the autophagy-regulated secretion of IL-1\u03b2."

We first performed a differential centrifugation to obtain 3k, 25k and 100k membrane pellet fractions. Both IL-1\u03b2 and the lipidated form of LC3 (LC3-II), a protein marker of autophagosome, were mainly enriched in the 25k membrane fraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We then separated the 25k membrane through a sucrose step gradient ultracentrifugation where both IL-1\u03b2 and LC3-II co-distributed in the L fraction at the boundary between 0.25 M and 1.1 M layer of sucrose (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Further fractionation of the L fraction using an OptiPrep gradient showed co-fractionation of IL-1\u03b2 with LC3-II (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To confirm the presence of IL-1\u03b2 in the autophagosome, we performed immunoisolation of LC3-positive autophagosomes from the 25k fraction and found that IL-1\u03b2, especially the mature form, co-sedimented with autophagosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Consistent with our observations, a recent study also showed a colocalization of IL-1\u03b2 and LC3 in the form of puncta in macrophages (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dupont et al., 2011</a>). These data demonstrate that at least a fraction of intracellular mature IL-1\u03b2 associates with the autophagosome, possibly related to its role in IL-1\u03b2 secretion."

One possibility is engulfment through the closure of the phagophore membrane during autophagosome maturation as in the capture of autophagic cargo. In this scenario, closure of the phagophore to complete autophagosome formation would be required to sequester IL-1\u03b2 away from the cytoplasm. Alternatively, we considered the possibility that IL-1\u03b2 may be translocated through a membrane into the lumen of the phagophore envelope and be sequestered from the cytoplasm even before the mature autophagosome is sealed. To test this possibility, we performed proteinase K protection experiments with the membranes from ATG2-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In control cells, p62 (an autophagic cargo) and a fraction of LC3-II (which was encapsulated after autophagosome completion), as well as mature IL-1\u03b2, were largely resistant to proteinase K digestion similar to the ER luminal protein, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). In contrast, SEC22B, a membrane anchored SNARE protein exposed to the cytoplasm, was sensitive to proteinase K digestion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Triton X-100 treatment permeabilized the membrane and rendered all proteins tested sensitive to proteinase K digestion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This demonstrated that the majority of membrane localized IL-1\u03b2 was sequestered within an organelle, likely the autophagosome, as demonstrated by the fractionation results of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>. However, the result did not pinpoint where within the autophagosome IL-1\u03b2 was housed. In ATG2-depleted cells, p62 and LC3-II remained sensitive to proteinase K digestion, consistent with the hypothesis that ATG2 is essential for maturation and closure of the autophagosome (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, in the same samples the majority of IL-1\u03b2 resisted degradation by proteinase K treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), except on addition of Triton X-100 to permeabilize membranes. Although the precursor form of IL-1\u03b2 remained associated with isolated autophagosome and phagophore membranes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), the protein was degraded when membranes from normal and ATG2-depleted cells were treated with protease in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 (data not shown). Thus, the mature but not the precursor IL-1\u03b2 appears to be transported into the phagophore."

To rule out the possibility that IL-1\u03b2 was engulfed by the small closed autophagosomes, we employed Atg5 KO MEFs in which the phagophore could not be closed (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kishi-Itakura et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mizushima et al., 2001</a>). Similar to what we observed in ATG2-depleted cells, IL-1\u03b2 was protected from proteinase K digestion in membranes from Atg5 KO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In addition, IL-1\u03b2 was sequestered within vesicles in FIP200 (another early factor in phagophore development (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hara et al., 2008</a>)) knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These data indicate that the entry of IL-1\u03b2 into the vesicle carrier is not dependent on the formation of the autophagosome. These results are inconsistent with a role for engulfment of IL-1\u03b2 by the maturing phagophore and suggest instead that IL-1\u03b2 may be translocated across a membrane into a vesicle precursor of the phagophore, possibly at a very early stage in the development of the organelle."

As protein unfolding is usually required for protein translocation, we adopted an approach used in many other circumstances wherein a targeted protein is fused to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme whose three-dimensional structure is stabilized by the folate derivative aminopterin, hence providing a chemical ligand to impede the unfolding process (<a href=\"#bib3\">Backhaus et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Eilers and Schatz, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wienhues et al., 1991</a>). We first determined the secretion of the DHFR-fused IL-1\u03b2. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, secretion of a mature IL-1\u03b2-DHFR fusion protein was enhanced by starvation similar to the untagged counterpart. Importantly, IL-1\u03b2-DHFR secretion was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of aminopterin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Of notice, treatment of aminopterin did not completely abolish IL-1\u03b2 secretion perhaps due to a cell death-induced release of IL-1\u03b2 at high concentrations of aminopterin, as indicated by the release of a low level of tubulin into the medium fraction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). As a control, aminopterin did not reduce the secretion of untagged IL-1\u03b2, confirming its specific effect on DHFR (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Fractionation of cells incubated with aminopterin showed a reduced level of IL-1\u03b2 in the membrane fraction with a corresponding increase in the cytosol fraction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The residual DHFR-tagged IL-1\u03b2 associated with membranes from aminopterin-treated cells was sensitive to proteinase K digestion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), indicating that this pool of membrane-associated IL-1\u03b2 did not translocate into the lumen of the vesicle. The data suggest that entry of IL-1\u03b2 into a vesicle carrier involves a process of protein unfolding and translocation."

To visualize the subcellular localization of IL-1\u03b2, we employed U2OS cells, which formed large and distinct autophagosomes after starvation. U2OS cells co-expressing p-IL-1\u03b2 and p-caspase-1 secreted IL-1\u03b2 in a starvation-enhanced and PI3K-dependent manner similar to HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In cells expressing either p-IL-1\u03b2 and p-caspase-1, or m-IL-1\u03b2 alone, LC3 and IL-1\u03b2 were observed by confocal microscopy to localize together or adjacent to one another on the edge of ring-shaped autophagosomes (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To further resolve these ring structures, we employed 3D STORM (<a href=\"#bib29\">Huang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rust et al., 2006</a>) super-resolution microscopy (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hell, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s4\">4</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>).

Around 18 ring structures of IL-1\u03b2 accounting for ~5% of the total IL-1\u03b2 signal were observed in each cell.

The diameter of the structures double-labeled with LC3 and IL-1\u03b2 are ~700 nm (larger structures up to 2 \u03bcm in diameter were also found) which is comparable to the size of the autophagosome. Occasionally, we also found IL-1\u03b2 localized in the center of the ring structure, where cytoplasmic autophagic cargoes fill, surrounded by LC3 (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

We devised a further visual test of this conclusion using selective permeabilization of cell surface and intracellular membranes with digitonin and saponin, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). We compared antibody accessibility to IL-1\u03b2 and DFCP1, a marker located on the cytosolic surface of the omegasome (a harbor for the phagophore) in both WT and Atg5 KO cells. Consistent with a cytosolic surface localization, DFCP1 was readily labeled in cells treated with digitonin alone (selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane) in both WT and Atg5 KO cells (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5A\u2013E</a>). In contrast, IL-1\u03b2 was accessible to the antibody only after treatment with digitonin and saponin (gently permeabilizes the endomembrane) (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5A,B and F</a>) in WT cells. This by itself would not distinguish localization of IL-1\u03b2 to the intermembrane space vs the cytoplasmic enclosed space of a mature autophagosome. However, in Atg5 KO cells where the phagophore precursor envelope remains open and exposed to the cytosol, saponin treatment was necessary to expose IL-1\u03b2 to antibody and roughly half of the labeled structures coincided with the phagophore marker DFCP1 (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5C,D and F</a>). This visual assay further confirms the intermembrane localization of IL-1\u03b2 in the phagophore and autophagosome."

We analyzed the primary sequence of IL-1\u03b2 and found three KFERQ-like motifs on IL-1\u03b2 including <sup>127</sup>LRDEQ<sup>131, 132</sup>QKSLV<sup>136</sup> and <sup>198</sup>QLESV<sup>202</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We mutated the glutamine, which has been shown to be essential for the function of the motif, as well as an adjacent amino acid in each motif (E130Q131, Q132K133 and Q198L199) to alanines and examined the secretion efficiency of these mutants. The 130-131AA mutant did not affect secretion of IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). However, the Q132K133 and Q198L199 mutations were both defective in secretion of mature IL-1\u03b2 which instead accumulated in the cytoplasmic fraction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). A low level of release of the pro-forms persisted as seen with WT and mutant protein (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The cytoplasmic mature forms of the mutant proteins were less abundant in the membrane fraction compared with the WT mature IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, compare the lanes without proteinase K treatment). In addition, the membrane associated mutant IL-1\u03b2 remained proteinase K accessible (less than 10% of protection compared with ~45% of WT IL-1\u03b2), demonstrating that these two KFERQ-like motifs are required for the membrane translocation of IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Equal amounts of WT and mutant p-IL-1\u03b2 associated with the membrane but both remained largely proteinase K accessible (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

HSP70 has also been implicated in autophagy and stress responses (<a href=\"#bib50\">Murphy, 2013</a>). We performed shRNA-mediated knockdown of the three chaperone proteins to assess their potential role in the membrane translocation of IL-1\u03b2. Knockdown of Hsp90, but not of Hsp70 or Hsc70 substantially reduced IL-1\u03b2 secretion (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). As a control, knockdown of Hsc70 compromised CMA as indicated by the stabilization of a CMA cargo, GAPDH (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Moreover, secretion of mature IL-1\u03b2 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by an HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). In both experiments, mature IL-1\u03b2 accumulated in the cytosol fraction at the expense of secretion. Knockdown of Hsp90 also rendered IL-1\u03b2 accessible to proteinase K digestion (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), consistent with a role for HSP90 in the translocation of IL-1\u03b2 as opposed to some later secretion event. Furthermore, in a co-immunoprecipitation assay, HSP90 associated with m-IL-1\u03b2 but not the translocation-deficient mutants Q132K133 and Q198L199 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Although p-IL-1\u03b2 also formed a complex with HSP90, the efficiency appeared lower than for m-IL-1\u03b2. These results suggest that HSP90 binds to a region of the mature IL-1\u03b2, including the essential residues Q132K133 and Q198L199, to promote the translocation event. Cleavage of p-IL-1\u03b2 by caspase-1 may potentiate the recruitment of HSP90 to the mature form of IL-1\u03b2 however chaperone binding is not required for this proteolytic event (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8D</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7B</a>)."

Unconventional secretory cargoes, such as IL-1\u03b2 and Acb1, have been shown to have overlapping requirements with formation of the autophagosome or its precursor suggesting that the autophagosome may physically convey these cargo proteins to the cell surface. A key question is if and how these cargoes engage the autophagosome and how this structure exports soluble cargo molecules. In this study, we probed the organelle association and molecular requirements for the secretion of one such unconventional cargo protein, IL-1\u03b2. Using surrogate cell lines rather than macrophages to reconstitute autophagy-mediated secretion of IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), we find mature IL-1\u03b2 localized to the lumen of the membrane in early intermediates and mature autophagosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). This surprising location may help to explain how mature IL-1\u03b2 is secreted in a soluble form to the cell surface (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). However, localization to the lumen between the two membranes of the autophagosome would require that IL-1\u03b2 is translocated from the cytoplasm across the membrane precursor of a phagophore, rather than being engulfed as the phagophore membrane matures by closure into an autophagosome. Our evidence suggests that IL-1\u03b2 must unfold or be held in an unfolded state to promote membrane translocation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and that a complex sorting signal in the mature portion of IL-1\u03b2 interacts with HSP90 to deliver the chaperone and its cargo to a site on a phagophore precursor membrane where the mature species is translocated (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig9\">9</a>)."

Unlike FGF2, the entry of IL-1\u03b2 into the autophagosomal carrier appears to be dependent on protein unfolding in a conformational state that may be fostered by the association of HSP90 with two KFERQ-like sequences within the mature portion of IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>). This translocation mechanism appears superficially similar to another delivery process termed HSC70-dependent CMA in which autophagic cargoes bearing KFERQ targeting motifs are directed into the lysosome for degradation. Indeed, using a cell-free approach to study the import of CMA cargo into isolated lysosomes, Salvador et al. (2000) reported that DHFR fused to a CMA cargo is blocked in translocation by addition of methotrexate, a drug that stabilizes DHFR to unfolding, just as we have shown that IL-1\u03b2 fused to DHFR is blocked in cells treated with a cell permeable folate analog, aminopterin (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wei et al., 2013</a>). In our fractionation study, IL-1\u03b2 distributed in LC3-positive autophagosomal carriers that were separated from the lysosome marker LAMP2, the proposed receptor or channel for uptake of CMA cargo (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kaushik and Cuervo, 2012</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This observation, together with the involvement of a different chaperone i.e. HSP90, suggests distinct routes for IL-1\u03b2 and cargoes of the CMA pathway."

                        "text": "The target membrane for IL-1\u03b2 translocation may be a vesicle that could fuse with or form the autophagosome. We find that mature IL-1\u03b2 can be detected within protease inaccessible membranes in cells blocked early in the autophagic pathway (e.g. ATG5 null cells and cells depleted of FIP200, both of which block at a stage prior to the lipidation of LC3). The identity of the vesicle carrier is unknown and could be any one of those reported to supply membrane to the formation of the autophagosome (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ge et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lamb et al., 2013</a>). Although we have ruled out the involvement of LAMP2A IL-1\u03b2 translocation, it is likely that a membrane receptor locating on the membrane of the vesicle carrier, perhaps a functional equivalent of LAMP2A, recruits the protein complex of HSP90 and IL-1\u03b2, therefore designating the correct membrane targeting of IL-1\u03b2. In addition, a protein conducting channel may be involved in the translocation of IL-1\u03b2 into the membrane. It seems unlikely that a standard translocation channel, such as SEC61, is involved in this import process, but no current evidence bears on this point."

Fusion of the autophagosome directly with the plasma membrane would lead to the release of soluble IL-1\u03b2 available to trigger an inflammatory response in the surrounding tissue. If mature IL-1\u03b2 were engulfed within the cytoplasmic interior of the autophagosome, fusion of this organelle at the cell surface might release an intact vesicle corresponding to the inner membrane-enclosed cytoplasmic compartment of the autophagosome. We found mature IL-1\u03b2 secreted by macrophages or in our surrogate cell system to be completely soluble, thus inconsistent with the engulfment model (data not shown). An alternative possibility may be that the autophagosome fuses with another intracellular organelle such as the MVB or the lysosome under conditions where the inner membrane of the autophagosome is degraded. If so, mature IL-1\u03b2 would be available for secretion if the combined organelle (amphisome, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>) fused with the plasma membrane. However, for this model to be viable, the mature IL-1\u03b2 released on dissolution of the autophagosome inner membrane would have to withstand proteolytic attack such as may be encountered in an amphisome or lysosome. Because mature IL-1\u03b2 is clearly sensitive to proteolysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), thus any compartment engaged in presenting autophagosomal content to the cell surface must be depleted of proteases. The nature of the organelle that delivers autophagosome content to the plasma membrane may be probed by selective ablation of different Rab proteins, e.g. Rab11, Rab27 and Rab35, which appear to be required for fusion of the MVB with the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hsu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ostrowski et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Savina et al., 2002</a>), or Rab27a and Rab38, implicated in the fusion of lysosomes at the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blott and Griffiths, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hume et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jager et al., 2000</a>)."

Coverslips were sealed using Cytoseal 60. STORM imaging was performed on a homebuilt setup based on a modified Nikon Eclipse Ti-U inverted fluorescence microscope using a Nikon CFI Plan Apo \u03bb 100x oil immersion objective (NA 1.45). Dye molecules were photoswitched to the dark state and imaged using either 647- or 560-nm lasers (MPB Communications); these lasers were passed through an acousto-optic tunable filter and introduced through an optical fiber into the back focal plane of the microscope and onto the sample at intensities of ~2 kW cm<sup>-2</sup>. A translation stage was used to shift the laser beams towards the edge of the objective so that light reached the sample at incident angles slightly smaller than the critical angle of the glass-water interface. A 405-nm laser was used concurrently with either the 647- or 560-nm lasers to reactivate fluorophores into the emitting state. The power of the 405-nm laser (typical range 0\u20131 W cm<sup>-2</sup>) was adjusted during image acquisition so that at any given instant, only a small, optically resolvable fraction of the fluorophores in the sample were in the emitting state. Emission was recorded with an Andor iXon Ultra 897 EM-CCD camera at a framerate of 110\u2009Hz, for a total of ~80,000 frames per image. Multicolor imaging was performed by imaging each color channel separately and sequentially using separate emission filters and excitation lasers. For 3D STORM imaging, a cylindrical lens was inserted into the imaging path so that images of single molecules were elongated in opposite directions for molecules on the proximal and distal sides of the focal plane (<a href=\"#bib29\">Huang et al., 2008</a>). The raw STORM data was analyzed according to previously described methods (<a href=\"#bib29\">Huang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rust et al., 2006</a>)."

This translocation depends on two KFERQ-like motifs, typically required for protein translocation across the lysosomal membrane via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and is also dependent of Hsp90, but not Hsc70. Although how IL-1\u03b2 is secreted rather than being delivered to lysosomes and how GRASP and MVB proteins actually work in IL-1\u03b2 secretion remains unclear, the present study focuses on the sequestration step. However, there are several major concerns outlined below."

The data of Atg2 KD and Atg5 KO could be reasonable because some intermediate structures can be generated in these cells. In contrast, phagophores are not generated in FIP200 KO cells. However, a significant amount of m-IL-1\u03b2 is still resistant to proteinase K treatment in FIP200 cells. It suggests that IL-1\u03b2 is sequestered in some membranous structures other than phagophores, which exist in a large amount comparable to that of phagophores in control cells. Although it is possible that these may be phagophore precursors, what is the assurance that this is phagophore-related?"

The authors show that m-IL-1\u03b2 is protease-protective in several autophagy mutants. The data of Atg2 KD and Atg5 KO could be reasonable because some intermediate structures can be generated in these cells. In contrast, phagophores are not generated in FIP200 KO cells. However, a significant amount of m-IL-1\u03b2 is still resistant to proteinase K treatment in FIP200 cells. It suggests that IL-1\u03b2 is sequestered in some membranous structures other than phagophores, which exist in a large amount comparable to that of phagophores in control cells. Although it is possible that these may be phagophore precursors, what is the assurance that this is phagophore-related?</i>"

Our data demonstrates a relationship of secretion of IL-1\u03b2 to autophagy and the transition of IL-1\u03b2 through an autophagosome carrier by showing that 1) the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 is compromised in the absence of several essential autophagy genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>); 2) IL-1\u03b2 resides in LC3-positive compartments during secretion as demonstrated by fractionation, immunoisolation and imaging approaches (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6s4\">4</a>); and 3) IL-1\u03b2 may also localize to phagophore structures before the completion of double-membrane autophagosome as shown by the co-fractionation of IL-1\u03b2 with LC3 in Atg2 RNAi cells where the LC3-positive vesicles are still in the state of phagophore or small closed double-membrane structures. To further confirm the relationship of IL-1\u03b2 with phagophore, we have now performed immunofluorescence experiments by analyzing the localization of IL-1\u03b2 and DFCP1, an omegasome marker that decorates the phagophore, in WT U2OS cells and Atg5 KO MEFs. In both cell lines, more than half of IL-1\u03b2 colocalized with DFCP1 confirming a relationship of IL-1\u03b2 with the phagophore (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 5</a>). Even though we demonstrate a transition of IL-1\u03b2 through phagophore and autophagosome during secretion, it is possible that the site of IL-1\u03b2 translocation may be neither one of them, as a deficiency of FIP200 did not compromise the entry of IL-1\u03b2 into the vesicles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). As indicated in the Discussion of our manuscript, the site of IL-1\u03b2 translocation could be a vesicle that could become a phagophore, especially in the absence of FIP200. However, we could not completely rule out the possibility that the site of IL-1\u03b2 translocation is a combination of phagophore, autophagosome and a vesicle other than in WT cells. We agree with the reviewers that to pinpoint the site of membrane translocation of IL-1\u03b2 is important. However, to completely define the targeting membrane for IL-1\u03b2 translocation, it is important to identify the translocon, or an equivalent, directly responsible for IL-1\u03b2 translocation, as well as to reconstitute the translocation process in vitro. This will take at least 1-2 years\u2019 effort. Therefore, we think that these objectives should be our future work and beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We hope that the reviewers agree with our opinion. We have further discussed these points in the Discussion section."

To rule out CMA, we analyzed CMA in the absence and presence of the shRNA against Hsc70 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>). GAPDH, a CMA substrate, was decreased 2-fold after serum starvation and inhibition of protein synthesis, and this degradation was compromised by knockdown of Hsc70 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>). However, in this condition, the secretion and membrane entry of IL-1\u03b2 were not affected indicating that this key chaperone for CMA is not involved in the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). To further rule out the possibility of CMA, we knocked down Lamp2A, the lysosomal receptor required for CMA, which again blocked the reduction in CMA-induced degradation of GAPDH but did not affect the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1C-D</a>). In addition, we did co-immunoprecipitation experiments and found that IL-1\u03b2 associates with HSP90 but not HSC70 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>). HSC70 and HSP90 plays different roles in CMA, HSC70 binds CMA substrates and is involved to deliver substrates to the lysosome. HSP90 is required for LAMP2A oligomerization and stability on the lysosomal membrane, which is essential for substrate translocation. However, in the case of IL-1\u03b2 secretion, HSP90 acts as a functional equivalent of HSC70 for CMA. We also used glycyl-L-phenylalanine-2-naphthylamide (GPN), a lysosome-disrupting cathepsin C substrate, to disrupt the lysosome, which led to a dramatic decrease of cathepsin D (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1E</a>), a lysosome luminal hydrolase, in the membrane fraction. However, the level of IL-1\u03b2 in the membrane fraction was not affected by lysosome disruption (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1E</a>) indicating the majority of IL-1\u03b2 is not in the lysosome, or at least the digestive lysosome, during secretion. In summary, all those data indicate that the translocation of IL-1\u03b2 is mechanistically different from CMA."

However, such experiments would require extensive preparatory work and involve a double-immunogold labeling protocol that we currently do not have access to in our lab. As a compromise, we performed selective permeabilization of cell membranes by two detergents, digitonin and saponin (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 5</a>). The former one selectively permeabilizes plasma membrane at low temperature and the later one mildly permeabilizes the endomembrane. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 5</a>, after digitonin treatment, DFCP1 could be labeled by antibodies, as it decorates the cytosolic surface of omegasome (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 5B and D</a>, green and blue). Interestingly, IL-1\u03b2 puncta could not be labeled after digitonin treatment, but they appeared after saponin treatment in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 5B</a>, red). As two of the three possibilities of IL-1\u03b2 localization illustrated in <a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 5</a> panel A, IL-1\u03b2 puncta should be protected by membrane (either on the inner membrane surface or intermembrane space according to the ring structure obtained from STORM). To discern the two possibilities, we performed the experiment in Atg5 KO cells where the phagophore is not closed. Similarly, the IL-1\u03b2 puncta could be labeled only after saponin treatment (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 5D</a>, red). According to the illustration in <a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 5</a> panel C, the probability is that IL-1\u03b2 localizes to the intermembrane space. In addition to these experiments, we also quantified the number of ring structures of IL-1\u03b2 obtained from the STORM. On average, there are ~18 ring structures in each cell that consists of ~5% of the total IL-1\u03b2 signal. These ring structures appear representative of the localization of IL-1\u03b2 in the autophagosome as we have found many of these structures in different cells from independent experiments."
