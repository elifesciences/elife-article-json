However, little is known about the cellular mechanisms sperm use to gain competitive advantage or how these mechanisms are regulated genetically. Here, we utilize a forward genetic screen in <i>C. elegans</i> to identify a gene, <i>comp-1</i>, whose function is specifically required in competitive contexts. We show that <i>comp-1</i> functions in sperm to modulate their migration through and localization within the reproductive tract, thereby promoting their access to oocytes. Contrary to previously-described models, <i>comp-1</i> mutant sperm show no defects in size or velocity, thereby defining a novel pathway for preferential usage. Our results indicate not only that sperm functional traits can influence the outcome of sperm competition, but also that these traits can be modulated in a context-dependent manner depending on the presence of competing sperm."
