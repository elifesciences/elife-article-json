Using <i>Drosophila</i> and human cells, we show here that seipin, an ER protein implicated in LD biology, mediates a discrete step in LD formation\u2014the conversion of small, nascent LDs to larger, mature LDs. Seipin forms discrete and dynamic foci in the ER that interact with nascent LDs to enable their growth. In the absence of seipin, numerous small, nascent LDs accumulate near the ER and most often fail to grow. Those that do grow prematurely acquire lipid synthesis enzymes and undergo expansion, eventually leading to the giant LDs characteristic of seipin deficiency. Our studies identify a discrete step of LD formation, namely the conversion of nascent LDs to mature LDs, and define a molecular role for seipin in this process, most likely by acting at ER-LD contact sites to enable lipid transfer to nascent LDs."

Using <i>Drosophila</i> and human cells, we show here that seipin, an ER protein implicated in LD biology, mediates a discrete step in LD formation\u2014the conversion of small, nascent LDs to larger, mature LDs. Seipin forms discrete and dynamic foci in the ER that interact with nascent LDs to enable their growth. In the absence of seipin, numerous small, nascent LDs accumulate near the ER and most often fail to grow. Those that do grow prematurely acquire lipid synthesis enzymes and undergo expansion, eventually leading to the giant LDs characteristic of seipin deficiency. Our studies identify a discrete step of LD formation, namely the conversion of nascent LDs to mature LDs, and define a molecular role for seipin in this process, most likely by acting at ER-LD contact sites to enable lipid transfer to nascent LDs."

Although most eukaryotic cells make LDs, the mechanism underlying the initial formation of LDs is mostly unknown.

In cells, this appears to be a well-organized process and can be conceptually separated into several distinct biochemical steps that are particularly evident when cells are incubated with exogenous fatty acids to induce them to form TG-containing LDs. In the initial step, enzymes utilize fatty acids and glycerolipids to synthesize neutral lipids, such as TGs, in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). TGs are subsequently packaged into nascent LDs that grow and are thought to bud from the ER to form initial LDs (iLDs). How cells utilize proteins to harness the principles of emulsion physics to control these initial steps in LD formation is unclear."

Targeting of GPAT4 to LDs and formation of these bridges depends on the Arf1/COP-I proteins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wilfling et al., 2014b</a>). Another enzyme, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase 1 (CCT1), binds to phosphatidylcholine (PC)-poor surfaces of eLDs, where it becomes activated and catalyzes the synthesis of PC to coat eLD surfaces (<a href=\"#bib24\">Krahmer et al., 2011</a>).

The seipin gene was initially identified by mutations in rare but severe forms of congenital generalized lipodystrophy (<a href=\"#bib27\">Magr\u00e9 et al., 2001</a>). Subsequently, LD morphology screens in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> showed that the seipin homologue Fld1 is required for normal LDs; in its absence, cells have many small LDs or a few 'supersized' or giant LDs, depending on growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fei et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Szymanski et al., 2007</a>). Seipin is an integral membrane protein with two transmembrane domains and a large, evolutionarily conserved ER luminal loop (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agarwal and Garg, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lundin et al., 2006</a>). Seipin forms oligomers (<a href=\"#bib5\">Binns et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sim et al., 2013</a>). In yeast, seipin localizes to ER-LD contact regions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grippa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Szymanski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), and yeast cells lacking seipin have abnormal LD formation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cartwright et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Grippa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), suggesting a role for seipin in organizing this process.

We found that seipin acts at a distinct step of LD biogenesis, after nascent LDs form during iLD formation. Our data suggest that seipin localizes to ER-LD contact sites and enables nascent LDs to acquire more lipids from the ER and grow to form mature iLDs. Without seipin, this process appears to be blocked, resulting in massive accumulation of small nascent LDs. The few LDs that do grow exhibit aberrant targeting of lipid synthesis enzymes, such as GPAT4, involved in forming eLDs. The latter process likely explains the giant LD phenotype characteristically found in seipin-deficient cells."

To determine the molecular basis of this phenotype, we examined when LD formation first appeared to be abnormal in seipin-deficient cells. Within 1\u2009hr of adding oleic acid to cells, LDs in seipin-depleted cells were larger than those in control cells, although almost all LDs were less than 2\u2009\u03bcm in diameter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>, top). Giant LDs (diameter \u2265 2\u2009\u03bcm) first appeared in seipin knockdown cells ~5\u2009hr after adding oleic acid and were more prevalent after 8\u2009hr. In contrast, giant LDs were rare in control cells. Seipin-depleted cells also had fewer LDs than control cells, particularly at later times (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, bottom). Since the total areas with BODIPY-stained LD signal in optical sections of seipin-depleted cells and control cells at late time points were similar, the LDs likely coalesced in seipin-deficient cells."

(<b>C</b>) Sequence analysis of seipin knockout clone. Seipin knockout clone of SUM159 cell line was generated with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced. The seipin knockout clones contain heterozygous mutations in exon 3, with an 8-nucleotide deletion on one allele and a 1-nucleotide deletion on the other, leading to frame shift in both alleles. (<b>D</b>) Expression of seipin protein in wildtype and seipin knockout SUM159 cells was examined by western blot with antibody against endogenous seipin. No detectable seipin protein was found in the seipin knockout clone. (<b>E</b>) Seipin does not affect lipid levels in SUM159 cells. Lipids were extracted from cell homogenate and microsomes of wildtype or seipin knockout SUM159 cells. Lipid classes and species were identified with LC-MS based lipidomics. n=3 biological replicates and 2 technical replicates. PA standard curve shows that PA measurement was linear at a concentration range similar to that in samples, as low as 0.75 pmol. (<b>F</b>) No apparent PA accumulation at LD formation sites in seipin-depleted cells. SUM159 cells co-transfected with cherry-<i>LiveDrop</i> and GFP-PASS were imaged 30 min after adding oleic acid. The majority of the cherry and GFP signal does not overlap at the LD formation site. As a positive control, addition of PMA to control cells induced GFP-PASS distribution to the plasma membrane (arrowhead)."

To examine this possibility, we used [<sup>14</sup>C]-oleic acid as a tracer to measure lipid synthesis in seipin-depleted cells. Rates of accumulation of TG, PC, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were similar in control and seipin knockdown cells both in cell homogenates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and microsomes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), indicating similar rates of glycerolipid synthesis. Steady-state levels and synthesis rates of lipids in seipin-depleted cells showed no differences by high-resolution shotgun lipidomics (<a href=\"#bib3\">Almeida et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ejsing et al., 2009</a>) at 3\u2009hr after adding [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]-oleic acid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). To ensure the lack of differences in lipid synthesis was not due to residual seipin, we deleted seipin in human mammary carcinoma cells (SUM159) by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ran et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Additionally, expression of a probe, GFP-PASS (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lu et al., 2016</a>), that senses the accumulation of PA and possibly other anionic phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib20\">Horchani et al., 2014</a>) did not accumulate at any specific site in cells during LD formation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Since seipin resides in the ER membrane, changes in lipid composition might occur in the ER but be masked in global analyses by lipids from other membranes. However, the ER morphology appeared normal in seipin-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), and we did not find evidence of altered ER lipid composition (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,E</a>).

When the TG reaches a critical mass, it is thought to undergo phase separation and bud from the ER as iLDs. We hypothesized that seipin might act at one of these steps to facilitate iLD formation."

Such studies require a fluorescent probe sensitive enough to detect TG collections during the earliest steps of LD formation. These normally have too little lipid mass to be detected by conventional neutral lipid dyes (e.g., BODIPY) that partition preferentially into the neutral lipid phase. We therefore developed a probe, which we named <i>LiveDrop</i>, that contains the membrane hairpin domain (amino acids 160\u2013216) of the glycerolipid synthesis enzyme GPAT4 fused to a fluorescent protein (<i>mCherry or eGFP</i>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wilfling et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Although full-length GPAT4 normally localizes only to eLDs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wilfling et al., 2013</a>), <i>LiveDrop</i> localizes from the ER to all newly synthesized LDs upon their formation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>, control) and identifies TG collections before BODIPY (as seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). <i>LiveDrop</i> localization to foci that become LDs depends on TG synthesis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), and in in vitro experiments using adhesive emulsion (<a href=\"#bib35\">Thiam et al., 2012</a>), we found that <i>LiveDrop</i> partitions preferentially into monolayers over bilayer membranes compared with a control protein Arf1 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Together, these data demonstrate that <i>LiveDrop</i> is a sensitive probe, identifying the earliest steps of LD formation. The finding that LiveDrop localizes to all newly synthesized LDs whereas the full-length GPAT4 localizes only to eLDs suggests a retention mechanism that maintains GPAT4 in the ER during LD formation."

In control cells, when LD formation was induced by oleic acid, <i>LiveDrop</i>, which was initially diffuse within the ER, rapidly accumulated in small puncta that grew larger within minutes and subsequently became detectable with BODIPY (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). In contrast, the ER of seipin-deficient cells had large numbers (up to an average of 60 per cell, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) of small <i>LiveDrop</i> puncta that mostly did not grow large enough to stain with BODIPY (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). Instead, they stayed small and highly mobile (0.23 \u00b1 0.06\u2009\u03bcm/s) at the ER (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). However, a few larger, BODIPY-positive LDs formed in many of the seipin-depleted cells, possibly due to TG phase separation in a non-seipin organized process. BODIPY-stained LDs formed in control cells were relatively static (0.07 \u00b1 0.02\u2009\u03bcm/s), compared with LiveDrop puncta in seipin-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). To clarify the identity of <i>LiveDrop</i> puncta in seipin-knockdown cells, we inhibited TG synthesis with pharmacological inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>) or by knocking down TG synthesis enzymes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). These treatments abolished the <i>LiveDrop</i> puncta, indicating that they depend on TG synthesis and are likely very small TG collections associated with the ER."

After prolonged oleic acid treatment (24\u2009hr), giant LDs formed in each seipin deficiency model.

To test whether the conserved regions are important for its function in iLD formation, we overexpressed fluorescently tagged regions of seipin in a setting of seipin depletion in the S2 cell model. We knocked down seipin with dsRNA targeting the 3\u2032UTR to avoid degradation of expressed seipin proteins. These knockdowns were somewhat less efficient than targeting the open reading frame, with ~65% of cells exhibiting accumulation of BODIPY-negative <i>LiveDrop</i> puncta (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). When full-length <i>Drosophila</i> seipin was expressed in the knockdown cells, the numbers of <i>LiveDrop</i> puncta were dramatically reduced in most cells. Tagging with a fluorescent protein localized to the N- or C-terminus resulted in similar rescue efficiency 30\u2009min after oleate loading (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Deletion of the N- or C-terminal cytosolic domain or both did not affect the rescue efficiency of seipin overexpression. In contrast, expression of the N- or C-terminus alone did not rescue the phenotype (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). These results suggest that the evolutionarily conserved regions of seipin (i.e., the ER luminal domain and transmembrane domains) are required for seipin\u2019s function in organizing iLD formation. In agreement with evolutionary conservation of seipin\u2019s function, expression of human seipin in seipin-depleted <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells completely abolished abnormal <i>LiveDrop</i> puncta accumulation, and mature iLDs formed normally in all transfected cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>)."

Consistent with images obtained by live cell imaging, wildtype cells contained numerous mature iLDs ranging in diameter between 200\u2013500 nm, with an average of ~300 nm, after 60\u2009min of oleate treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). In contrast, seipin-deficient cells showed a large accumulation of nascent LDs of uniform size of less than 200\u00a0nm diameter, with an average of ~170 nm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). These nascent LDs were most often located in close proximity to the ER. To determine whether the monolayer covering them was continuous with or separate from the ER membrane, we used electron tomography to examine thick sections of cells. We found that the nascent LDs in seipin<i>-</i>deficient cells were always in close proximity to the ER and that their surface monolayer was separated from the ER membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">Videos 7</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">8</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">9</a> and <a href=\"#media10\">10</a>). Modeling of the tomograms indicated that ribosomes appeared to be absent from the space between the nascent LDs and the ER and that this space sometimes had electron density <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#media11\">Video 11</a>. Taken together, these data suggest that the <i>LiveDrop</i> puncta represent nascent LDs that are separate from, but in close contact with the ER, and that fail to grow to the size of normal, mature iLDs."

Without oleic acid, GFP-seipin formed distinct foci in cells that overlapped with an ER marker (ss-BFP-KDEL; (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dayel et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These foci did not localize to any specific domain of the ER (e.g., tubules, sheets, tips) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) or three-way junctions marked by lunapark (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and they moved rapidly along the ER (1.06 \u00b1 0.22\u2009\u03bcm/s; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>).

It was unclear, however, how arrested growth early in LD formation leads to the phenotype of giant LDs in late stages of formation. Accumulation of nascent iLD intermediates in the early stages might indirectly result in fewer but larger LDs. We hypothesized that the LD expansion pathway, catalyzed by TG synthesis on eLDs, is aberrantly activated during seipin deficiency. In the LD expansion pathway, GPAT4 targets to selected LDs to initiate localized TG synthesis to expand LDs, and GPAT4 is thus a marker for eLDs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wilfling et al., 2013</a>). Immunofluorescence of endogenous GPAT4 in seipin-depleted cells showed that GPAT4 targets to LDs as early as 10\u2009min after LD formation is induced by oleic acid. In control cells, GPAT4 localizes to LDs much later (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) (not until 1\u2009hr after induction of LDs, not shown). At 20\u2009min after adding oleic acid, 18% of LDs in seipin knockdown cells were marked by GPAT4, but only 1\u20132% in control cells were GPAT4-positive (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>).

In fact, most of the GPAT4 pool was localized to LDs in seipin-depleted cells, and little remained in the ER (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This observation suggests that accumulation of nascent iLDs in seipin deficiency caused aberrant GPAT4 targeting to LDs, thereby initiating localized TG synthesis and LD expansion prematurely."

If phospholipids, specifically PC, are deficient on eLDs in seipin-deficient cells, CCT1 should have increased targeting to LDs during formation. Indeed, seipin-depleted cells exhibited earlier and markedly increased CCT1 targeting to LDs, compared with control cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Further, when seipin-deficient cells were treated with PC liposomes or choline supplementation, no giant LDs (diameter &gt; 2.5\u2009\u03bcm) in seipin deficiency were formed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, yellow box). In contrast, PC liposomes corrected the phenotype of CCT1 deficiency, and as expected, choline supplementation did not. We also altered phospholipid synthesis by knock down of CCT1 or CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (ECT) and tested the effect on seipin knockdown. ECT knockdown is predicted to shift the balance of phospholipid synthesis to PC from PE. As expected, CCT1 depletion aggravated, and ECT depletion abolished, the seipin knockdown phenotype (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>).

Oligomers of seipin form highly mobile foci in the ER that interact with small, nascent LDs at ER-LD contact sites and enable their growth to mature iLDs, likely by promoting neutral lipid transport.

With ongoing TG synthesis, some of these intermediates, or possibly other LDs arising from random coalescence of ER TG collections, appear to prematurely engage the eLD pathway, and undergo expansion mediated by LD-localized lipid synthesis enzymes (e.g., GPAT4 and CCT1). As a late phenotype of seipin deficiency, giant LDs (&gt;1\u20132 \u00b5m diameter) form eventually from these fewer abnormal eLDs, probably by coalescence due to a relative lack of PC on their surfaces.

At later time points in LD biogenesis, we observed that each LD was associated with at least one seipin punctum. Our findings are consistent with several studies in yeast indicating that seipin localizes to ER-LD contact sites (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cartwright et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Grippa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). We also found that small nascent LDs almost always associate with the ER, even when seipin was absent, suggesting these LDs are still connected to the ER via contact sites. Consistent with the notion of ER-LD contact sites, the electron-tomograms revealed an absence of ribosomes between the nascent iLDs and the ER membrane. The close connections of the organelles and possible contact sites suggest that other proteins might be involved in establishing ER-LD contact sites and are still present in seipin deficiency."

In support of this, seipin deficiency resulted in similar phenotypes of larger numbers of LiveDrop-positive foci in cells from flies, human mammary carcinoma cells, and human fibroblasts from seipin-deficient subjects. Additionally, the evolutionarily conserved transmembrane domains and luminal ER loop were sufficient for seipin\u2019s function in LD formation. The role of the variable N-terminal domain is less clear. We found that the overexpressed N-terminus of <i>Drosophila</i> seipin localized to LDs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting that this part of the protein, though not required for formation, may aid in interaction with LDs. In yeast, the N-terminus was found to be functionally important with respect to the timing of LD formation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cartwright et al., 2015</a>)."

In the absence of seipin, we found that large numbers of nascent iLDs accumulate, and some of these LDs aberrantly entered the LD expansion pathway. In support of this, lipid synthesis enzymes, such as GPAT4 and CCT1, that are normally found only on late-forming eLDs were aberrantly targeted to iLDs at early time points, and this mislocalization of eLD proteins to iLDs was crucial for the development of the giant LD phenotype at later time points. Similar abnormal protein targeting to LDs was recently found in yeast lacking seipin orthologues (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grippa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2014</a>)."

Our data do not support these models. For example, seipin was hypothesized to primarily regulate lipid metabolism in the ER, including phospholipid synthesis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fei et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2011c</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tian et al., 2011</a>), and this in turn affects LD formation. We found no evidence to support this model, either in studies of glycerolipid synthesis rates or in the activities of specific enzymes (such as GPAT; not shown). We also found no evidence of accumulation of PA in membranes of seipin-deficient S2 cells, a finding that has been reported by several groups for seipin deficiency in yeast (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fei et al., 2011c</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Sim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tian et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wolinski et al., 2015</a>). We also found no evidence of seipin primarily affecting ER morphology or ER stress activation, which would normally be associated with defects in calcium homeostasis, as has been suggested (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bi et al., 2014</a>). Since seipin appears to act downstream of the budding of nascent LDs, it might be expected that ER functions are largely conserved and unaffected by seipin deficiency."

Cells lacking seipin can still form LDs, but these LDs have irregular size and abnormal lipid and protein composition, which likely leads to cellular dysfunction with respect to storing and reclaiming lipids for cellular needs. In support of this notion, seipin deficiency in humans leads to severe generalized lipodystrophy, with a near absence of adipose mass (<a href=\"#bib27\">Magr\u00e9 et al., 2001</a>). Seipin therefore is a crucial part of the cellular protein machinery that serves to organize oil emulsification for fat storage. Our findings also suggest that seipin likely works in concert with other proteins that mediate ER-LD contact to enable the growth of nascent LDs."

The HPLC was connected on-line to a Q-exactive mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source (ESI; Thermo). Mass spectra were acquired in data-dependent mode to automatically switch between full scan MS and up to 15 data-dependent MS/MS scans. The 15 most intense ions from the survey scan were selected and fragmented with higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) with stepped normalized collision energies of 20, 30 and 40 in negative mode and 25 and 35 in positive ion mode. Peaks were analyzed using the Lipid Search algorithm (MKI, Tokyo, Japan), defined through raw files, product ion and precursor ion accurate masses. Candidate molecular species were identified by database (&gt;1,000,000 entries) search of positive and negative ion adducts. Mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm for the precursor mass. Samples were aligned within a time window and results combined in a single report. Internal standards spiked in prior to extraction were used for normalization and calculation of the molar amounts of lipids."

They have been leaders in understanding the roles of triglyceride biosynthetic enzymes. In the current manuscript, they have worked to define the cell biology of seipin, an enigmatic protein that is mutated in a subset of patients with generalized lipodystrophy. In this paper, they provide evidence that seipin is involved in the maturation of small nascent lipid droplets to mature lipid droplets. This concept had already been proposed in yeast, but the manuscript by Farese and Walther elucidates the concept more clearly. They report that seipin forms discrete and dynamic foci in the ER that this molecule interacts with nascent LDs, and that this interaction is important for the growth and maturation of lipid droplets. In the absence of seipin, they propose that immature lipid droplets accumulate, and that the occasional lipid droplet that happens to grow is abnormal, in that it prematurely acquires lipid biosynthetic enzymes."

All recognized that the topic was important; all were positive to varying degrees about the manuscript and thought that it advanced our understanding of seipin cell biology. However, two of the reviewers had reservations. One of the reviewers was disappointed by the electron microscopy studies. In considering the original manuscript, it was the hope of the reviewers that the authors would characterize LiveDrops at the EM level. Such an undertaking would presumably require APEX electron microscopy. In the revised manuscript, the authors noted the size of lipid droplets in seipin-deficient cells, but the relationship of those lipid droplets to LiveDrops or to seipin is not clear. The authors noted that there appeared to be an accumulation of 200-nm lipid droplets in the seipin-deficient cells, but the data were not convincing because it was not clear how many experiments were performed with how many cell lines-and under what conditions. Also, it was not clear whether a similar accumulation of 200-nm particles occurs in tissues of seipin-deficient mice. Also, one reviewer was not convinced by the \"filaments\" in the EM tomography studies. Were those filaments only present in the interface between the lipid droplet and the ER, or did they surround the lipid droplet? Finally, several reviewers were disappointed by quantification of findings in several of the figures."

All three reviewers agreed that the findings were too preliminary. Each of the reviewers had substantive concerns, and it seemed unlikely that these concerns could be resolved in a reasonable period of time. All three external reviewers were duly impressed by the morphological findings detected with the LiveDrop probe, but there was a consensus that the nature of the \"LiveDrop\" needs to be characterized at the ultrastructural level. The reviewers also thought that it would be important to demonstrate that the LiveDrop probe detects equivalent structures in wild-type cells and seipin-deficient cells. One of the reviewers was not fond of the \"LiveDrop\" nomenclature, particularly since the primordial lipid droplets have not been fully characterized at an ultrastructural level. Another concern is that the manuscript, while strong on immunofluorescence microscopy, did not reveal mechanisms of seipin activity. Finally, one of the reviewers was not satisfied with the biochemistry and thought that the conclusion that there was no direct effect of seipin on phospholipid synthesis might be premature, stating \"the data shows that PC levels in LDs and the incorporation of FA into LD-associated PC are decreased in seipin deficient cells, despite abundant presence of CCT on LDs. This argues for a specific defect in LD-PC synthesis due to enzyme inhibition (e.g. CPT) or choline deficiency. A more elaborate lipid analysis of LD-associated lipids and ER lipids and better characterization of the involved biochemical pathways are needed to conclude that seipin does not interfere with phospholipid metabolism. Specifically, the role of seipin in PA metabolism has not been sufficiently addressed to conclude that it plays no role in PA metabolism (as claimed by Fei et al., Tian et al. or Wolinsky et al.). Cellular concentrations of PA in cell homogenates, microsomal fractions, or LDs are extremely low. Regular lipidomic approaches may not be adequate to detect differences (e.g. Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D). The authors should consider using PA specific probes such as the GFP-Spo20 reporter protein.\" The reviewers\u2019 comments are pasted at the bottom of the letter."

Despite the vast literature on seipin its molecular function is not known yet. Here the authors find that depletion of seipin in <i>Drosophila</i> induces LD morphology defects. It is shown that abnormal droplets in seipin-deficient cells are sensitive to changes in phospholipid synthesis without affecting lipid levels, largely confirming previous work. Then, the authors use \"LiveDrop\", presumably a very sensitive marker for LDs to interrogate early stages of LD formation. In wt cells, LiveDrop preceded BODIPY staining in nascent LDs. In contrast, dynamic LiveDrop puncta that remain BODIPY-negative were detected in seipin-depleted cells. The appearance of these puncta was diminished upon interference with TAG synthesis. These results led to the proposal that seipin organizes initial TAG lenses into nascent LDs. These are potentially the most exciting findings but in my opinion, they are strongly over interpreted and undocumented. It is speculated that LiveDrop puncta mark initial TAG lenses but it not at all clear what they are. A thorough characterization of the LiveDrop puncta is essential to support this model- this would require both biochemical and ultrastructural analysis. If small puncta in seipin deficient cells are incipient lenses too small to be detected by BODIPY, it is expected that bigger puncta should become BODIPY-positive. However this is not the case for example in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> \u2013 at 22min LiveDrop puncta has a diameter of almost 0.5 \u03bcm (comparable to control) but it is still BODIPY-negative."

This is not due to any significant change in total lipid composition or amounts. Next, they generate a probe (LiveDrop) and show that it can detect very early neutral lipid (NL) aggregates. In wild type cells these are converted to droplets (BODIPY stained), but in the seipin KD the aggregates convert much less often. They show that the aggregates are highly mobile in the KD. Using CRISPR, they next show that seipin is itself mobile until it binds to an aggregate; its movement slows after that. The authors next show that GPAT4 targets to droplets much more rapidly in the KD, which can account for the supersized phenotype. They show that these supersized droplets have less phospholipid, as expected from geometry. They then do a seipin deletion analysis on CRISPR KO cells and show that the loop and TM regions of seipin are sufficient for function.

In the current manuscript, they have worked to define the cell biology of seipin, an enigmatic protein that is mutated in a subset of patients with generalized lipodystrophy. In this paper, they provide evidence that seipin is involved in the maturation of small nascent lipid droplets to mature lipid droplets. This concept had already been proposed in yeast, but the manuscript by Farese and Walther elucidates the concept more clearly. They report that seipin forms discrete and dynamic foci in the ER that this molecule interacts with nascent LDs, and that this interaction is important for the growth and maturation of lipid droplets. In the absence of seipin, they propose that immature lipid droplets accumulate, and that the occasional lipid droplet that happens to grow is abnormal, in that it prematurely acquires lipid biosynthetic enzymes.</i>"

However, we think that it is inaccurate to say that the concept of seipin helping nascent LDs in conversion to mature LDs has been proposed in yeast. The published yeast studies established that LD formation is delayed in seipin deficiency and that LD formation is affected, but did not provide data showing that seipin facilitates a specific step in LD formation. We believe our findings go considerably beyond the published yeast studies in this respect and provide new insights into the function of seipin in LD formation. Also, yeast and mammalian LDs and TG synthesis are considerably different. A key enzyme for LD formation in mammals, DGAT1, is absent in yeast and it is very much unclear to date whether the processes and seipin function are identical between systems. Thus, we feel it is justified and important to independently investigate seipin function in different model systems, in addition to yeast."

Also, it was not clear whether a similar accumulation of 200-nm particles occurs in tissues of seipin-deficient mice. Also, one reviewer was not convinced by the \"filaments\" in the EM tomography studies.

Even in this system, the late effects (i.e., &gt; 4-6 hours) are, as mentioned, the formation of large LDs due to expansion and localized TG synthesis enzymes. Any studies of tissues of the knockout mice would be hugely complicated by the late phenotype of giant LD formation. We cannot see a useful experiment to look at the earliest stages of LD formation in the knockout mouse tissues.

All three reviewers agreed that the findings were too preliminary. Each of the reviewers had substantive concerns, and it seemed unlikely that these concerns could be resolved in a reasonable period of time. All three external reviewers were duly impressed by the morphological findings detected with the LiveDrop probe, but there was a consensus that the nature of the \"LiveDrop\" needs to be characterized at the ultrastructural level. The reviewers also thought that it would be important to demonstrate that the LiveDrop probe detects equivalent structures in wild-type cells and seipin-deficient cells. One of the reviewers was not fond of the \"LiveDrop\" nomenclature, particularly since the primordial lipid droplets have not been fully characterized at an ultrastructural level. Another concern is that the manuscript, while strong on immunofluorescence microscopy, did not reveal mechanisms of seipin activity. Finally, one of the reviewers was not satisfied with the biochemistry and thought that the conclusion that there was no direct effect of seipin on phospholipid synthesis might be premature, stating \"the data shows that PC levels in LDs and the incorporation of FA into LD-associated PC are decreased in seipin deficient cells, despite abundant presence of CCT on LDs. This argues for a specific defect in LD-PC synthesis due to enzyme inhibition (e.g. CPT) or choline deficiency. A more elaborate lipid analysis of LD-associated lipids and ER lipids and better characterization of the involved biochemical pathways are needed to conclude that seipin does not interfere with phospholipid metabolism. Specifically, the role of seipin in PA metabolism has not been sufficiently addressed to conclude that it plays no role in PA metabolism (as claimed by Fei et al., Tian et al. or Wolinsky et al.). Cellular concentrations of PA in cell homogenates, microsomal fractions, or LDs are extremely low. Regular lipidomic approaches may not be adequate to detect differences (e.g. Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D). The authors should consider using PA specific probes such as the GFP-Spo20 reporter protein.\" The reviewers\u2019 comments are pasted at the bottom of the letter.</i>"

Despite the vast literature on seipin its molecular function is not known yet. Here the authors find that depletion of seipin in Drosophila induces LD morphology defects. It is shown that abnormal droplets in seipin-deficient cells are sensitive to changes in phospholipid synthesis without affecting lipid levels, largely confirming previous work. Then, the authors use \"LiveDrop\", presumably a very sensitive marker for LDs to interrogate early stages of LD formation. In wt cells, LiveDrop preceded BODIPY staining in nascent LDs. In contrast, dynamic LiveDrop puncta that remain BODIPY-negative were detected in seipin-depleted cells. The appearance of these puncta was diminished upon interference with TAG synthesis. These results led to the proposal that seipin organizes initial TAG lenses into nascent LDs. These are potentially the most exciting findings but in my opinion, they are strongly over interpreted and undocumented. It is speculated that LiveDrop puncta mark initial TAG lenses but it not at all clear what they are. A thorough characterization of the LiveDrop puncta is essential to support this model- this would require both biochemical and ultrastructural analysis. If small puncta in seipin deficient cells are incipient lenses too small to be detected by BODIPY, it is expected that bigger puncta should become BODIPY-positive. However this is not the case for example in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> \u2013 at 22min Livedrop puncta has a diameter of almost 0.5 \u03bcm (comparable to control) but it is still BODIPY-negative. Besides this major concern on the characterization of the \"LiveDrop puncta\" there are a number of other minor issues that it would be important to address to make this work suitable for publication.</i>"

                    "text": "Based on the reviewer\u2019s excellent comments, we have performed additional experiments, as well as more rigorous characterization of some reagents we use. These experiments lead us to a breakthrough in our thinking concerning seipin function. In particular added electron tomography of seipin knockout cells revealed that the accumulating intermediates are nascent LDs that remain in contact, but are separate, from the ER. With these data, we now hypothesize that seipin functions at ER-LD contact sites to enable lipid transfer to the nascent LDs, enabling their growth to mature initial LDs. This is a major advance in understanding seipin and LD formation and is reflected in many changes in the new manuscript, including the new title. In addition, we have added significant amounts of data for the characterization of LiveDrop, the probe we use to visualize nascent LDs, and we have added additional data regarding our lipid measurements. For the issue of phospholipids changes in seipin-depleted cells, we reviewed our lipidomic data and concluded that our assays are linear for detection of PA in the experiments. In addition, we performed the experiment of expressing a \u201cPA probe\u201d in wild-type and seipin KO SUM cells, and we did not see accumulations of this probe near the nascent LDs (as others have seen in yeast with Fld1 deletion). We agree with the reviewer that at late time points, there are LD-specific changes in phospholipids, including our finding of a relative deficiency of phospholipids to TG. However, our collective data in S2 cells and SUM cells do not indicate a direct role for seipin in phospholipid synthesis during the earliest stages of LD formation, and we continue to believe that any changes likely reflect later indirect effects of seipin deficiency. We believe that our article now is the first to clearly show that the formation and growth of initial LDs in the ER is a protein-facilitated process, and to identify seipin as an essential player in mediating a step in this process, namely the conversion of nascent iLDs to mature iLDs."
