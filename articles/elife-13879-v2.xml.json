Nodal morphogens play critical roles in embryonic axis formation in many organisms. Models proposed to generate the Nodal gradient include diffusivity, ligand processing, and a temporal activation window. But how the Nodal morphogen gradient forms in vivo remains unclear. Here, we have measured in vivo for the first time, the binding affinity of Nodal ligands to their major cell surface receptor, Acvr2b, and to the Nodal inhibitor, Lefty, by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. We examined the diffusion coefficient of Nodal ligands and Lefty inhibitors in live zebrafish embryos by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We also investigated the contribution of ligand degradation to the Nodal gradient. We show that ligand clearance via degradation shapes the Nodal gradient and correlates with its signaling range. By computational simulations of gradient formation, we demonstrate that diffusivity, extra-cellular interactions, and selective ligand destruction collectively shape the Nodal morphogen gradient."

Nodal morphogens play critical roles in embryonic axis formation in many organisms. Models proposed to generate the Nodal gradient include diffusivity, ligand processing, and a temporal activation window. But how the Nodal morphogen gradient forms in vivo remains unclear. Here, we have measured in vivo for the first time, the binding affinity of Nodal ligands to their major cell surface receptor, Acvr2b, and to the Nodal inhibitor, Lefty, by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. We examined the diffusion coefficient of Nodal ligands and Lefty inhibitors in live zebrafish embryos by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We also investigated the contribution of ligand degradation to the Nodal gradient. We show that ligand clearance via degradation shapes the Nodal gradient and correlates with its signaling range. By computational simulations of gradient formation, we demonstrate that diffusivity, extra-cellular interactions, and selective ligand destruction collectively shape the Nodal morphogen gradient."

The morphogens move across cells and tissues to form gradients of the signal. Cells then respond in different ways depending on how much of the signal they receive. This, in turn, depends on several factors: first, how quickly or slowly the signal moves; second, how well the morphogen binds to responding cells and other molecules in its path; and third, how much signal is lost or destroyed during the movement."

The experiments gave insights into how far Nodal signals move and remain active. The results showed that, in addition to Nodal diffusing and binding to receiving cells, one of the most important factors determining how far and quickly Nodal moves is its inactivation and destruction.

How morphogen gradients are formed is not fully understood. Studies in many organisms have suggested three major mechanisms to establish morphogen gradients: 1) diffusion, 2) transcytosis and 3) via cytonemes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Green, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">M\u00fcller et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rogers and Schier, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wartlick et al., 2009</a>). For example, the gradient of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) is established by diffusion and is regulated by extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dowd et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Duchesne et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Makarenkova et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Miura et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nowak et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2009</a>), whereas the gradient of <i>Drosophila</i> Decapentaplegic (Dpp) is established not only by diffusion, but also via transcytosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dierick and Bejsovec, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kruse et al., 2004</a>) and cytonemes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hsiung et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ramirez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Roy et al., 2011</a>)."

They serve as mesendoderm inducers in vertebrates, and are involved in many aspects of embryonic axis formation during development (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kumari et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sampath and Robertson, 2016</a>). Nodal proteins are translated as precursors and function as dimers (<a href=\"#bib36\">Massagu\u00e9, 1990</a>). The Nodal precursors are cleaved by extracellular convertases, and convertase processing was found to be essential for Nodal activation in zebrafish and mouse embryonic tissues (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beck et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Le Good et al., 2005</a>). A recent report found that FurinA convertase activity regulates long range signaling by the zebrafish left-right patterning Nodal, Southpaw (Spaw), but not other Nodal factors (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tessadori et al., 2015</a>). Upon activation, Nodal proteins form complexes with type II and type I Activin receptors (Acvr1b; Acvr2a/b), which are serine/threonine kinases (<a href=\"#bib45\">Reissmann et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yeo and Whitman, 2001</a>) and activate the Nodal pathway (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kumar, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Massagu\u00e9 et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Whitman, 1998</a>). Nodal target genes include <i>nodal</i> itself and <i>lefty</i>, which encodes a feedback inhibitor of Nodal signaling (<a href=\"#bib6\">Branford and Yost, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Meno et al., 1999</a>). In zebrafish, of the three nodal homologs, <i>cyclops (cyc), squint (sqt)</i> and <i>southpaw (spaw), sqt</i> and <i>cyc</i> are expressed in an overlapping pattern in the gastrula margin where presumptive mesoderm and endoderm cells are located (<a href=\"#bib15\">Erter et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Feldman et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gritsman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Long et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rebagliati et al., 1998a</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">1998b</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sampath et al., 1998</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib56\">van Boxtel et al., 2015</a>).

The diffusion coefficient of a molecule is a measure of its ability to move freely across a defined region. The free diffusion coefficient of the zebrafish Nodals has been suggested to be faster than their effective diffusion coefficient (<a href=\"#bib39\">M\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">2013</a>), resulting in fast diffusion over short distances but slow diffusion over longer distances presumably by morphogen trapping at high affinity binding sites. These observations led to the hypothesis that Nodal diffusion is hindered either by cell surface interactions or by molecules in the extracellular matrix (<a href=\"#bib40\">M\u00fcller et al., 2013</a>). How Nodal diffusion is hindered, and to what extent it shapes the Nodal gradient is unclear."

Repression by miRNA-430 likely plays a key role in regulation of Nodal signaling. However, miRNA-430 is not exclusive to <i>lefty1</i> but also targets <i>nodal/sqt</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Choi et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, reporter\u00a0protein expression and ribosome-profiling data from zebrafish embryos indicate that Nodal/Sqt and Lefty1 are translated in a similar temporal window in the early gastrula (<a href=\"#bib11\">Choi et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib3\">Bazzini et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chew et al., 2013</a>).

We estimated the affinity of Nodals to the type II receptor Acvr2b on the cell surface and to Lefty inhibitors in the extracellular space by single wavelength fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (SW-FCCS). SW-FCCS uses a single laser to excite proteins labeled with spectrally different fluorophores within the observation volume (e.g., the confocal volume) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Shi et al., 2009a</a>). By analyzing the correlated movement of various labeled proteins (ligands/receptor/inhibitor), we determined the fraction of the proteins that were free or bound, and calculated the dissociation constants in live zebrafish embryos. We also investigated the contribution of ligand stability in forming the Nodal gradient. By analyzing diffusion and binding in vivo\u00a0and from computational simulations, we show that diffusivity alone is insufficient to generate the Nodal morphogen gradient. Our findings show that in order to generate and maintain a robust Nodal morphogen gradient, ligand clearance by degradation is balanced against the binding and release of Nodal ligands with the receptor and inhibitors."

In this scenario, the mobility of ligands that bind with higher affinity to the receptors will be more effectively retarded. To quantitate the binding affinity of Nodal ligands to the receptors, we determined the apparent dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of Sqt and Cyc in vivo (<a href=\"#bib17\">Foo et al., 2012b</a>) with the predominant Nodal receptor Acvr2b, using FCCS. To uncouple binding from signaling events within the cytoplasm, we fused the extracellular and trans-membrane domains of Acvr2b lacking the intracellular kinase domain, to a red fluorescent protein, mCherry (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Sqt-EGFP, Cyc-EGFP or control secreted eGFP (sec-EGFP) fusion proteins were expressed from a localized source in embryos that uniformly expressed Acvr2b-mCherry, and correlation curves were obtained to infer the K<sub>d</sub>. Surprisingly, the K<sub>d</sub> of Sqt-Acvr2b is 65 \u00b1 7 nM and the K<sub>d</sub> of Cyc-Acvr2b is 124 \u00b1 12 nM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013I</a>).

Modeling of the Nodal morphogen gradient requires a range of different parameters, of which some have been measured in vivo and are available, and we have in this study determined binding affinities, and inferred concentrations (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We found the dissociation constants, <i>K<sub>D</sub></i>, of Sqt and Cyc to their major cell surface receptor Acvr2, to be ~60 and 120 nM, respectively. In addition, we determined the diffusion coefficients of the Nodals to be ~60 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s. From the amplitude of our FCS measurements, we estimated the concentration of the Nodal factors to be on the order of 10<sup>2</sup> nM. We determined that the degradation rate for Cyc is higher than that for Sqt, confirming previous work (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tian et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jing et al., 2006</a>). Nonetheless, because our degradation rate values were estimated from cell culture, in our simulations we use the values of 0.0001/s and 0.0005/s for Sqt and Cyc, respectively, documented in or estimated from previous reports (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jing et al., 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib39\">\u00a0M\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>). In the simulations we produced particles with 0.07/s to 0.7/s in the simulation volume (corresponding to a production rate of 0.3\u20133 pM/s) to obtain sufficient number of particles for statistical analysis. The number of particles at equilibrium is given by the ratio of production over degradation rate, which was 700\u20137000 for a degradation rate of 0.0001/s and 140\u20131400 for 0.0005/s. Importantly, the production rate itself does not change the gradient shape and only the gradient amplitude is altered. Therefore, the gradient shape is determined by the degradation rate and diffusion."

Using a gradient length of about 30\u2009\u03bcm and the other values as given in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, we estimate the effective diffusion coefficient to be on the order of 0.045 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s.

The estimation of the receptor number of 40\u2009\u03bcM is based on the value of D<sub>eff</sub> required to establish the gradient of appropriate dimensions for Sqt. At this time it is not clear whether this concentration comprises only membrane receptors or whether additional binding sites (e.g., in interstitial spaces between cells) contribute to it as shown for Fgf8 (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2009</a>). Any corrections in binding affinities for the receptor or different affinities for additional binding sites would alter the required concentration. Importantly, this number is dependent on the clearance/degradation rates that we have based upon previous reports, and which could change with more precise <i>in vivo</i> measurements. Based on the above, we assume that 40\u2009\u03bcM is the upper limit for the receptor concentration.

However, their mobility is too great to account for the sharp gradients observed in developing embryos. The diffusion coefficient values determined by FCS are ~3 to 85 times higher than the effective diffusion coefficients reported using FRAP (18.9 \u00b1 3.0 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s for Lefty2, 3.2 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s for Sqt and 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s for Cyc) (<a href=\"#bib40\">M\u00fcller et al., 2013</a>). FCS and FRAP produce different readouts because they measure diffusion in different contexts, time windows and scales. FCS determines diffusion within a small volume (&lt;1 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>) and on a short timescale (&lt;1\u2009s), whereas FRAP measures net diffusion over a large area (&gt;1,000 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>) over a longer time period (&gt;&gt;10\u2009s). FCS has been very useful to determine local diffusion, to infer the concentration of molecules within a defined confocal volume, and to determine the affinity of molecular interactions within the defined confocal volume. FRAP has been very useful for examining large-scale movement of molecules in tissues. The diffusion coefficients determined by the two techniques are known to vary dramatically. For example, in <i>Drosophila</i> imaginal discs, the measured diffusion coefficient of Dpp-GFP is 10 \u00b1 1\u00a0\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s from FCS measurements (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>), and 0.1 \u00b1 0.05\u00a0\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s by FRAP (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kicheva et al., 2007</a>). This difference is thought to arise from other factors (e.g., by degradation of the molecules during diffusion). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest there must be other molecules and mechanisms in the embryo that refine and shape the Nodal morphogen gradient."

To explain the long range distribution of Sqt compared to Cyc, it was also proposed that Sqt might have a lower binding affinity to its receptors, (<a href=\"#bib39\">M\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>). However, we find that Sqt in fact binds in vivo to Acvr2b with a higher affinity than the short-range Nodal, Cyc. Sqt also binds to Lefty with higher affinity, raising the possibility that Lefty-binding might alter Sqt activity. Another potential mechanism for gradient formation is rapid clearance of molecules during diffusion, as observed for Dpp in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kicheva et al., 2007</a>). Our measurements and calculations strongly support this mechanism."

However, the difference in clearance rates of Sqt, Cyc, Lefty1 and Lefty2 determined by photo-conversion assays is not pronounced enough to explain their very different decay lengths (<a href=\"#bib39\">M\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, M\u00fcller et al. found that their fluorescent Cyc fusion protein was expressed at very low levels in the extracellular matrix, but exhibited an unusual punctate distribution close to the plasma membrane and in the cytosol, whereas their Sqt fusion showed a strong, uniform and mainly intracellular distribution. The punctate distribution of Cyc suggests that Cyc might undergo a much faster and/or sustained endocytosis process compared to Sqt. This supports our finding that cells selectively destroy Nodal ligands by recognizing the lysosome-targeting signal, since the ligands have to be internalized."

In the simulations, 80% and 95% of steady state levels for Cyc is achieved at 0.7 and 1.25\u2009hr, respectively, which is consistent with the timing of mesoderm induction in the gastrula. By the same predictions, Sqt reaches the 80% and 95% levels at ~4\u00a0hr and 7\u00a0hr, respectively, which is longer than expected. However, these simulations have not taken into consideration cell divisions or binding to other factors that could influence the gradient.

Thus, a higher clearance rate would predict a lower receptor concentration and vice versa. It will be interesting to determine these values with higher accuracy in live zebrafish embryos. In addition, some aspects of the system have not been taken into account in our simulations. In particular, we found that Lefty binds the Nodals with high affinity. This may not influence gradient formation as the Sqt/Lefty and Cyc/Lefty complexes likely diffuse very similarly to Sqt and Cyc given that their size difference is within a factor of two. However, Lefty will influence Sqt and Cyc signaling when in complex, even if this is not directly evident in the gradient of fluorescent molecules. We also have not considered how the Nodal co-receptor (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yan et al., 1999</a>) influences gradient formation. It will be interesting to determine how Oep/Cripto co-receptors and Lefty shape the active signaling gradient. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has been shown to play a key role in regulating diffusion of FGFs, presumably via interactions with heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Makarenkova et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 2009</a>). It is not known if the ECM or HSPGs play a role in modulating the Nodal morphogen gradient although sulfated proteoglycans have been proposed to provide directional cues for left-asymmetric Nodal in <i>Xenopus</i>\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Marjoram and Wright., 2011</a>)."

The medium with transfection reagent was removed and replaced with fresh Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies,\u00a0Carlsbad,\u00a0CA) 24\u2009hr after addition of transfection reagent. Cell culture supernatants were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen 24\u2009hr after the removal of the transfection reagent. Small aliquots of frozen supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and protein G dynabeads (Life Technologies), and eluted with 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma). The samples were immunobloted with the same antibody and the signals were detected with a Syngene PXi gel imaging system. The band intensity was quantified using ImageJ. To determine the clearance rate of the proteins, the remaining supernatant was diluted to the same concentration as supernatants from non-transfected cells, mixed with sec-EGFP-3xFLAG supernatant for input control, added to dishes with non-transfected cells and collected at different time points. Proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche,\u00a0Switzerland) was added immediately after the supernatants were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The supernatants were enriched and detected as described above. The intensity of individual protein bands was normalized against EGFP to correct for differences in sample volume and immunoprecipitation, and normalized to time 0 for relative changes."

Initial simulations to determine effective diffusion coefficients in the presence of cells as obstacles (tortuosity) and morphogen binding were conducted in 3D. For this purpose, we simulated a 3D slab of 2\u2009\u03bcm height (<i>z</i>-axis), 44\u2009\u03bcm width (<i>y</i>-axis), and 86.7\u2009\u03bcm length (<i>x</i>-axis), for 5 s (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). We used a diffusion coefficient of <i>D</i> = 60 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s, and created 1000 particles at the left border of the simulation volume. The particles were allowed to perform a random walk for 5 s with a time resolution of 5 ms per step. At the left and right borders (along the <i>x</i>-axis), particles were reflected. At the other four borders we used periodic boundary conditions. Based upon actual measurements from early gastrula embryos, we assumed that the space is packed with cells of ~10\u2009\u03bcm diameter, and an intercellular space (cell membrane-to-cell membrane distance) of ~2\u2009\u03bcm. As the height of the simulation volume was only 2\u2009\u03bcm, we used cylinders to represent the cells within this space. Under these circumstances, ligand diffusion was reduced by a factor of 1.84. This value is consistent with the findings of M\u00fcller et al. who reported tortuosity to reduce diffusion maximally by a factor of 2 (<a href=\"#bib40\">M\u00fcller et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, for further modeling we assumed the effective diffusion coefficient of the Nodals to be ~30 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s. In the case of binding we used the values in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a> to determine the average number of free particles at each step. All concentration profiles were normalized and fitted by the following equation to determine the effective diffusion coefficient:"

To be of broader interest the biophysical measurements made in this study need to be incorporated into a coherent, self-consistent model for Nodal spread that tests the main conclusions the authors make.</i>"

Therefore, for Cyc, 80% and 95% of steady state levels are achieved at 0.7 and 1.25 h, respectively, which is consistent with the timing for mesoderm induction in the gastrula. By the same predictions, Sqt reaches the 80% and 95% levels at ~4 and 7 h, respectively, which is longer than expected. We should add that we have not taken into consideration cell divisions etc. during that time or binding to other factors, and how such factors might influence the gradient."
