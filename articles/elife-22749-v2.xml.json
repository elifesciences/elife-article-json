But it is not known how these signals integrate with each other and how this depends on the perceived stimuli\u2019s predictability. \u2018Predictive coding\u2019 theories describe this integration in terms of how well top-down predictions fit with bottom-up sensory input. Identifying neural markers for such signal integration is therefore essential for the study of perception and predictive coding theories. To achieve this, we combined EEG methods that preferentially tag different levels in the visual hierarchy. Importantly, we examined intermodulation components as a measure of integration between these signals. Our results link the different signals to core aspects of predictive coding, and suggest that top-down predictions indeed integrate with bottom-up signals in a manner that is modulated by the predictability of the sensory input, providing evidence for predictive coding and opening new avenues to studying such interactions in perception."

But it is not known how these signals integrate with each other and how this depends on the perceived stimuli\u2019s predictability. \u2018Predictive coding\u2019 theories describe this integration in terms of how well top-down predictions fit with bottom-up sensory input. Identifying neural markers for such signal integration is therefore essential for the study of perception and predictive coding theories. To achieve this, we combined EEG methods that preferentially tag different levels in the visual hierarchy. Importantly, we examined intermodulation components as a measure of integration between these signals. Our results link the different signals to core aspects of predictive coding, and suggest that top-down predictions indeed integrate with bottom-up signals in a manner that is modulated by the predictability of the sensory input, providing evidence for predictive coding and opening new avenues to studying such interactions in perception."

Hence, the goals of this study were to simultaneously tag top-down and bottom-up signals, to identify a direct neural marker for the integration of these signals during visual perception and, further, to examine if, and how, such a marker is modulated by the strength of prior expectations."

To preferentially track top-down signals (i.e., putative prediction signals) we used semantic wavelet induced frequency tagging (SWIFT) that has been shown to constantly activate low-level visual areas while periodically engaging high-level visual areas (thus, selectively tagging the high-level visual areas; [<a href=\"#bib27\">Koenig-Robert and VanRullen, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Koenig-Robert et al., 2015</a>]).

We combined the two methods by presenting SWIFT-modulated images at 1.3 HZ while modulating the global luminance of the stimulus at 10 Hz to elicit SSVEP (See Materials and methods for details). Critically, we hypothesized that intermodulation (IM) components would appear as a marker of integration between these differentially tagged signals."

Indeed, various studies have demonstrated the relationship between stimulus predictability and neural responses (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kok et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">Todorovic et al., 2011</a>). Accordingly, we hypothesised that manipulating the predictability, or, as we label it, the level of <i>certainty</i> about the stimuli would modulate the IM responses.

The proportion of images changed over trials, ranging from trials in which both images appeared in nearly half the cycles (referred to as \u2018low certainty\u2019 trials) to trials in which one of the images appeared in nearly all cycles (referred to as \u2018high certainty\u2019 trials)."

(<b>B</b>) The SWIFT principle. Cyclic local-contour scrambling in the wavelet-domain allows us to modulate the semantics of the image at a given frequency (i.e. the tagging-frequency, F2\u00a0=\u00a01.3 hz, illustrated by the red line) while keeping low-level principal physical attributes constant over time (illustrated by the blue line) (<b>C</b>) Each trial (50 s) was constructed using one SWIFT cycle (~769 ms) of a randomly chosen face image (blue solid rectangle) and one SWIFT cycle of a randomly chosen house image (orange solid rectangle). For each SWIFT cycle, a corresponding \u2018noise\u2019 SWIFT cycle was created based on one of the scrambled frames of the original SWIFT cycle (orange and blue dashed rectangles). Superimposition of the original (solid rectangles) and noise (dashed rectangles) SWIFT cycles ensures similar principal local physical properties across all SWIFT frames, regardless of the image appearing in each cycle. (<b>D</b>) The two SWIFT cycles (house and face) were presented repeatedly in a pseudo-random order for a total of 65 cycles. The resulting trial was a 50 s movie in which images peaked in a cyclic manner (F2\u00a0=\u00a01.3 Hz). Finally, a global sinusoidal contrast modulation at F1\u00a0=\u00a010 Hz was applied onto the whole movie to evoke the SSVEP."

The goal of this study was to identify neural markers for the integration between top-down and bottom-up signals in perceptual inference, and to examine how this process is modulated by the level of certainty about the stimuli. Hierarchical Frequency Tagging combines the SSVEP and SWIFT methods that have been shown to predominantly tag low levels (V1/V2) and higher, semantically rich levels in the visual hierarchy, respectively. We hypothesised that these signals reflect bottom-up sensory-driven signals (or prediction errors) and top-down predictions. Critically, we considered intermodulation (IM) components as an indicator of integration between these signals and hypothesised that they reflect the level of integration between top-down predictions (of different strengths manipulated by certainty) and bottom-up sensory-driven input."

Contemporary accounts of perception treat these ideas in terms of Bayesian inference and predictive coding (<a href=\"#bib14\">Friston, 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hohwy, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Clark, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Friston and Stephan, 2007</a>). Under the predictive coding framework, hypotheses about the state of the external world are formed on the basis of prior experience. Predictions are generated from these hypotheses, which are then projected to lower levels in the cortical hierarchy, and continually tested and adjusted in light of the incoming, stimulus-driven, information. Indeed, the role of top-down signals in perception has been demonstrated in both animal and human studies (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hupe et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">Pascual-Leone and Walsh, 2001</a>). The elements of the sensory input that cannot be explained away by the current top-down predictions are referred to as the prediction error (PE). This PE is suggested to be the (precision weighted) bottom-up signal that propagates from lower to higher levels in the cortical hierarchy until it can be explained away, allowing for subsequent revisions of higher-level parts of the overall hypotheses. The notion of PEs has been validated by numerous studies (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hughes et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kellermann et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lee and Nguyen, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Todorovic et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wacongne et al., 2011</a>) and several studies suggest that top-down and bottom-up signals can be differentiated in terms of their typical oscillatory frequency bands (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fontolan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sedley et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sherman et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Michalareas et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mayer et al., 2016</a>). Perception, under the predictive coding framework, is achieved by an iterative process that singles out the hypothesis that best minimizes the overall prediction error across multiple levels of the cortical hierarchy while taking prior learning, the wider context, and precision estimations into account (<a href=\"#bib15\">Friston, 2009</a>). Constant integration of bottom-up and top-down neural information is therefore understood to be a crucial element in perception (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fahrenfort et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Friston, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tononi and Edelman, 1998</a>)."

The presence of IMs in themselves therefore cannot point conclusively at specific computational or neuronal processes to which the IMs could be mapped. Suggesting IMs as evidence for predictive coding rather than other theories of perception therefore remains to some degree indirect, however, various arguments indeed point to the recurrent and top-down mediation of the IM responses in our data."

Indeed, nonlinearities in predictive coding models are a <i>specific</i> corollary of top-down modulatory signals (<a href=\"#bib14\">Friston, 2005</a>). Varying certainty levels, as operationalised in our stimuli, would therefore be expected to impact IM signal strength through the nonlinear modulation of bottom-up input by top-down predictions. Specifically, higher certainty trials induced greater predictability of upcoming images and a greater overall match throughout the trial between predictions and sensory input. The increase in IM SNRs in our data may therefore reflect the efficient integration of, or the overall \u2018fit\u2019 between, predictions and sensory input that should be expected when much of the upcoming stimuli is highly predictable."

The relationships between possible \u2018causes\u2019 and \u2018states\u2019 (e.g. how the movement of a cloud in the sky impacts the luminance of objects on the ground) is learnt over time and is the crux of the dynamic generative model embodied by the brain. Appealing to this model, the conditional expectations of hidden causes and states may be suggested to be driven primarily by the SWIFT (tagging activity in areas rich in semantic information) and the SSVEP (tagging activity in areas responding to low-level visual features), respectively. Top-down predictions can therefore be expected to result in the formation of the IM components that reflect the nonlinear integration of SWIFT- and SSVEP-driven signals."

Supporting the predictive coding account of perception, our results suggest that top-down, semantically tagged signals are integrated with bottom-up sensory-driven signals, and this integration is modulated by the level of certainty about the causes of the perceived input."

Peaks at the tagging-frequency, <i>f</i> Hz, in the spectrum of the recorded signal are thus understood to reflect stimulus-driven neural activity. However, the use of SSVEP methods impose certain limitations for studying perceptual hierarchies. When the contrast or luminance of a stimulus is modulated over time, then all levels of the visual hierarchy are entrained at the tagging frequency. Thus, it becomes difficult to dissociate frequency tagging related to low-level feature processing from that related to high-level semantic representations."

In brief, sequences were created by cyclic wavelet scrambling in the wavelets 3D space, allowing to scramble contours while conserving local low-level attributes such as luminance, contrast and spatial frequency. First, wavelet transforms were applied based on the discrete Meyer wavelet and six decomposition levels. At each location and scale, the local contour is represented by a 3D vector. Vectors pointing at different directions but of the same length as the original vector represent differently oriented versions of the same local image contour. Two such additional vectors were randomly selected in order to define a circular path (maintaining vector length along the path). The cyclic wavelet-scrambling was then performed by rotating each original vector along the circular path. The inverse wavelet transform was then used to obtain the image sequences in the pixel domain. By construction, the original unscrambled image appeared once in each cycle (1.3 Hz). The original image was identifiable briefly around the peak of the embedded image (see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, also available at <a href=\"https://figshare.com/s/44f1a26ecf55b6a35b2f\">https://figshare.com/s/44f1a26ecf55b6a35b2f</a>), as has been demonstrated psychophysically (<a href=\"#bib26\">Koenig-Robert et al., 2015</a>)."

Using these two sequences, which, in the context of a full trial we refer to as SWIFT \u2018cycles\u2019, we created a 50 s \u2018movie\u2019 containing 65 consecutive cycles repeated in a pseudorandom order at F2\u00a0=\u00a01.3 Hz (~769 ms per cycle, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The identifiable image at the peak of each cycle was either the face or the house image. The SWIFT method was designed to ensure that the low-level local visual properties within each sequence (cycle) are preserved across all frames. However, these properties could differ significantly between the face and the house sequences, resulting in the potential association of SWIFT-tagged activity with differences in the low level features between the face and house cycles. To prevent this, we created and merged additional \u2018noise\u2019 sequences in the following way: First, we selected one of the scrambled frames from each of the original SWIFT sequences (the \u2018most scrambled\u2019 one, i.e. the frame most distant from the original image presented at the peak of the cycle). Then, we created noise sequences by applying the SWIFT method on each of the selected scrambled frames. In this way, each original \u2018image\u2019 sequence had a corresponding \u2018noise\u2019 sequence that matched the low-level properties of the image sequence. Finally, \u2018image\u2019 sequences were alpha blended with the \u2018noise\u2019 sequences of the other category with equal weights (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, image sequences are surrounded by solid squares and noise sequences with dashed squares). For example, cycles in which a face image was to appear contained the face image sequence superimposed with a house noise sequence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, right side). This way, the overall low level visual attributes were constant across all frames in the trial regardless of the identifiable image in each cycle."

To test this hypothesis, this study uses a novel hierarchical frequency tagging method which combines a recently developed semantic wavelet induced frequency tagging (SWIFT) with classical SSVEP (here: a sinusoidal contrast modulation of images). This allows for studying the effects of predictions and sensory inputs on brain activity in separate frequency bands and, importantly, examine integration of both signals in terms of intermodulation components."

That is, if both SSVEP and SWIFT components are present in the occipital cortex (the fact that the scalp distribution for SWIFT also seems to include some more anterior sensors does not mean that these signals are absent in the occipital cortex), we wondered whether the IMs might also be present there as a result of sensory processing. To give an intuition for this: if certain neurons respond to, let's say, houses, and if their 'house response' is modulated by the contrast of the house stimulus (as is highly likely), wouldn't these neurons show IM components without any involvement of top-down predictions? This point requires, at the very least, detailed consideration in the Discussion. It could potentially be tested by source space analyses, examining whether responses in FFA/OFA and PPA, respectively, show interactions between semantic category and contrast. However, we appreciate that this is a non-trivial extension of the study and leave the decision to the authors."

This is because under high certainty, consecutive images are more likely to be of the same category, thus possibly leading to adaptation in face/house sensitive neurons and hence a reduced SWIFT response. In other words, in the present design, certainty is confounded with stimulus adaptation. Again, this point would require a detailed discussion and the limits of interpretation should be acknowledged clearly."

That is, if both SSVEP and SWIFT components are present in the occipital cortex (the fact that the scalp distribution for SWIFT also seems to include some more anterior sensors does not mean that these signals are absent in the occipital cortex), we wondered whether the IMs might also be present there as a result of sensory processing. To give an intuition for this: if certain neurons respond to, let's say, houses, and if their 'house response' is modulated by the contrast of the house stimulus (as is highly likely), wouldn't these neurons show IM components without any involvement of top-down predictions? This point requires, at the very least, detailed consideration in the Discussion. It could potentially be tested by source space analyses, examining whether responses in FFA/OFA and PPA, respectively, show interactions between semantic category and contrast. However, we appreciate that this is a non-trivial extension of the study and leave the decision to the authors.</i>"

The alternative mechanism of neuronal integration involving sensory inputs alone should indeed be considered and addressed in the paper. We have given this issue much thought and have revised, employing your comments, to reflect that there are different ways to formulate this alternative interpretation. We also considered the possibility of source analysis, which we believe is an important avenue of research on IMs. We are currently thinking of the best study design (e.g., use of MEG rather than EEG for better localization) using hierarchical frequency tagging for source localization analysis. However, we believe that this may best be done in a separate future paper."
