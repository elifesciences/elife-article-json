We meta-analyzed transcriptomic experiments of muscles of ALS patients and mouse models, uncovering a p53 deregulation as common denominator. We then characterized the induction of several p53 family members (p53, p63, p73) and a correlation between the levels of p53 family target genes and the severity of muscle atrophy in ALS patients and mice. In particular, we observed increased p63 protein levels in the fibers of atrophic muscles via denervation-dependent and <i>-</i>independent mechanisms. At a functional level, we demonstrated that TAp63 and p53 transactivate the promoter and increased the expression of <i>Trim63</i> (MuRF1), an effector of muscle atrophy. Altogether, these results suggest a novel function for p63 as a contributor to muscular atrophic processes <i>via</i> the regulation of multiple genes, including the muscle atrophy gene <i>Trim63</i>."

We meta-analyzed transcriptomic experiments of muscles of ALS patients and mouse models, uncovering a p53 deregulation as common denominator. We then characterized the induction of several p53 family members (p53, p63, p73) and a correlation between the levels of p53 family target genes and the severity of muscle atrophy in ALS patients and mice. In particular, we observed increased p63 protein levels in the fibers of atrophic muscles via denervation-dependent and <i>-</i>independent mechanisms. At a functional level, we demonstrated that TAp63 and p53 transactivate the promoter and increased the expression of <i>Trim63</i> (MuRF1), an effector of muscle atrophy. Altogether, these results suggest a novel function for p63 as a contributor to muscular atrophic processes <i>via</i> the regulation of multiple genes, including the muscle atrophy gene <i>Trim63</i>."

Further analysis then showed that the protein p63 regulates an enzyme that actually breaks down the building blocks of muscles, which directly leads to the muscle wasting."

For example, atrophy and dysfunction of respiratory muscles lead to death in ALS patients (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rothstein, 2009</a>). As muscle atrophy is associated with complex pathologies, the exact mechanisms inducing muscle atrophy are varied and still debated. Typically, ALS has been considered a neurodegenerative pathology specifically causing alteration in motor neurons, but more recent findings indicate that the etiology of the pathology is more complex. Indeed, a number of additional cell types, such as astrocytes (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yamanaka et al., 2008</a>), microglia (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boill\u00e9e et al., 2006</a>) and muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wong and Martin, 2010</a>), have been described to be directly affected by the pathology and therefore to participate in the muscle atrophy."

Indeed, more recent studies have shown that p63 and p73 are also involved in myoblast differentiation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cam et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fontemaggi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Martin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rouleau et al., 2011</a>) and \u0394Np73 appears to protect muscle cells against stresses (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belloni et al., 2006</a>).

Two experiments contained gene expression data for the muscle of ALS patients and control individuals (E-MEXP-3260; E-GEOD-41414, [<a href=\"#bib41\">Pradat et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib8\">Bernardini et al., 2013</a>]). One experiment contained gene expression data for muscles of SOD1(G86R) mice that represents an ALS model in which the onset of the pathology is at 105 days of age (E-TABM-195 [<a href=\"#bib23\">Gonzalez de Aguilar et al., 2008</a>]). The last experiment contained gene expression data for muscles of SOD1(G93A) mice in which onset of the pathology occurs at 14 weeks of age (E-GEOD-16361, [<a href=\"#bib13\">Capitanio et al., 2012</a>]). Beside the better pathophysiological relevance, data obtained from biopsies of ALS patients also provided a better representation of the diversity of the genetic anomalies observed in patients. In addition, patients were at various stage of the pathology, hence establishing a representative scale of muscle alterations. The panel of datasets we chose also included two different mouse models of ALS, allowing us to pinpoint common and specific deregulations. Importantly, the SOD1 mouse models are well characterized for their muscular phenotype alterations. In particular, it has already been established that SOD1 mutants present altered functions in muscles, in contrast to other mutated proteins linked to ALS (TARDBP, FUS etc) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pansarasa et al., 2014</a>)."

Fold induction between control individuals and ALS individuals was set to twofold change and rawp value inferior to 0.05. We decided to focus on transcription factor deregulations. The bioinformatic analyses we performed pinpointed to only 7 transcription factors whose activity, indicated by coherent changes in expression of their target genes, was potentially deregulated in at least two out of four experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The activity of one transcription factor, NfKB, appeared deregulated only in experiments done with the mouse models. Deregulation of STAT1 activity was identified in three experiments. Interestingly, the activity of only three transcription factors, MyoD, Myogenin and p53, was identified to be commonly deregulated in all four experiments that included biopsies from patients and animal models. MyoD and Myogenin are muscle specific transcription factors involved in muscle cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zanou and Gailly, 2013</a>). P53 was the transcription factor with the highest number of deregulated genes (51 genes). Notably the p53 target genes <i>CDKN1A, GADD45A</i> and <i>PMAIP1,</i> among others, were found induced in all four experiments."

Our analysis revealed an increased expression of TA isoforms of <i>Trp63</i> in SOD1(G86R) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Strikingly, the mRNA levels of TA isoforms of <i>Trp63</i> were strongly induced towards the end of the disease (105 day), while the mRNA levels for \u0394N isoforms of <i>Trp63</i> were downregulated during the same time period. A similar tendency was observed for p53, TA and \u2206N isoforms of <i>p73</i>, albeit at a lower magnitude. The expression of TA isoforms of <i>Trp63</i> correlated with acetylcholine receptor alpha (<i>Chrna1)</i> expression, a molecular marker indicating the severity of muscular denervation. In addition, we analyzed the expression of two documented effectors of muscular atrophy, namely <i>Fbxo32</i> (Atrogin-1) and <i>Trim63</i> (MuRF1). These proteins are E3 ubiquitin ligases that target muscular proteins for degradation during muscular atrophy or remodeling (<a href=\"#bib36\">Murton et al., 2008</a>). Importantly, the deregulation of <i>Trp63</i> expression also correlated with the upregulation of these two markers. This is in accordance with our data from ALS patient muscle biopsies, whereby the expression of <i>P63</i> also correlated with the degree of muscle pathology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

Immunoblotting with a TAp63 isoforms specific antibody revealed a striking accumulation of p63 proteins in muscles of SOD1 (G86R) mice that correlated with the progression of the disease (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). When probing with a \u0394Np63 specific antibody, however, we did not observe any specific band. The use of a p63 antibody directed against all p63 isoforms confirmed an upregulation of p63 in muscles of SOD1(G86R) mice (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Immunohistochemistry with the same antibody also revealed markedly increased immunoreactivity in the nuclei of muscle fibers of SOD1(G86R) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In contrast, there was no significant increase in p73 staining (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In this case, the apparent higher number of p73 positive nuclei appeared to be due to the atrophy of the muscle fibers, increasing the density of cells/nuclei. Similar experiments to detect expression of p53 did not yield a specific staining. However, we observed by western blot some slight increase in p53 protein levels in protein extract of muscle from SOD1(G86R) mice (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, our data indicated a complex regulation of p53 family members during muscular atrophy, highlighted by significant increase of TAp63 messenger and protein expression levels in the skeletal muscles during ALS."

Several studies showed that the ALS etiology is complex and multifactorial, involving different cell types and molecular mechanisms. One established cause of muscular atrophy is motor neuron degeneration that leads to muscle denervation. However, it has also been shown that SOD1 mutants can also directly cause alteration in muscle cells such as SOD1 protein aggregates and mitochondrial abnormalities (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pansarasa et al., 2014</a>). To verify the first hypothesis, we induced denervation in 80 day-old wild type and SOD1(G86R) mice by sciatic nerve crush, and gastrocnemius muscles were analyzed 7 days later. Our results showed that denervation upregulated TAp63 mRNA levels five-\u00a0to\u00a0sixfold in wild-type mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Concomitantly, \u0394Np63 levels were downregulated 0.4-fold (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In SOD1(G86R) mice, nerve crush further accentuated changes in mRNA levels for TA and \u2206N isoforms of <i>Trp63</i>. In addition, the TAp63 target genes <i>Cdkn1a</i> and <i>Gadd45a</i> were found strongly induced after nerve crush (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). These results show that nerve injury leading to alteration of the motor axis seems to be sufficient to activate a TAp63 response."

Several target genes of the p53-family (<i>Bax, Cdkn1a, Gadd45a</i>) were induced upon overexpression of SOD1(G86R) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Similarly TAp63 expression was increased at the mRNA level and the protein level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, the mRNA levels as well as the promoter activity of \u25b3N isoforms of <i>P63</i> were downregulated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Romano et al., 2006</a>).

We also tested for a possible cross-regulation of \u25b3Np63 expression by the increased expression of TAp63 observed in ALS.

This assertion is first based on the bioinformatic signalling pathway analyses of 4 independent microarray experiments performed on muscle biopsies of ALS patients as well as two different mouse models of ALS. These analyses pointed out a deregulation of p53 as one of the only three transcription factors deregulated in all four experiments, and common between mouse and human patient samples. Moreover, detailed expression profile analyses of several p53 target genes (<i>Cdkn1a, Gadd45a, Pmaip1</i>) or the p53 family member, <i>P63</i>, showed that their expression correlated significantly with the severity of the pathology in humans. The signalling pathway analyses were confirmed with groups of individuals independent of those used for the microarrays and by additional experimental methods. RT-qPCR confirmed the induction of multiple target genes of the p53 family. In addition, expression analysis of p53 family members indicated that in ALS the <i>P63</i> gene seems more likely to play a regulatory role as the TAp63 isoforms are strongly upregulated and localized in the nuclei of the fibers during the ALS pathology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>, figure supplement 2, 3, 4, 7). Our observation that the deregulation of p63 and p63 target genes occurs in muscle of ALS patients that have not been selected for a particular genetic alteration indicates that these deregulations are likely to be a common feature in ALS, independently of whether it is SOD1 that is mutated or another gene. Additional experiments using other mouse models for TDP43 or FUS might confirm that. It was previously reported that p63 participates in muscle cell differentiation and metabolism, and contributes to cardiac muscle development (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cam et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Martin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rouleau et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Su et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Osada et al., 1998</a>). Now, by combining biopsies from ALS patients and an animal model for ALS, the present study provides the first solid evidence that p63 might also participate in muscular atrophy."

In addition, we detected p53 and p73 protein expression in muscles tissues. Several studies support this possibility by showing that p53 and p73 play a role in muscle cell differentiation, cachexia and survival (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schwarzkopf et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cam et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">Soddu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tamir and Bengal, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Porrello et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Weintraub et al., 1991</a>). However, genetic inactivation of p53 does not affect ALS progression, muscle development or muscle regenerative capacity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Donehower et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">White et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kuntz et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Prudlo et al., 2000</a>). Nevertheless, our results suggest that the absence of p53 could be compensated by p63 or even p73. The slight increased in p53 protein levels observed in protein extracts of muscle from SOD1(G86R) mice might be caused by the production of ROS that stabilized p53 through post-translational modifications as previously described in other stresses (<a href=\"#bib62\">Vurusaner et al., 2012</a>). In addition, the slight increase in p53 RNA level we observed might also contribute."

For instance, we showed that <i>P63</i> deregulation could have an intercellular origin represented by the loss of interaction between the muscle and the nerve cells, as provoked in the nerve crush experiment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Hence, the degeneration of the motor neurons that is characteristic of ALS would be sufficient to explain the increased expression of TAp63 and its target genes in ALS. However, we also observed that <i>P63</i> deregulation can have an intrinsic origin resulting from expression of SOD1(G86R) in muscle cells causing intracellular stresses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Indeed, ALS-associated SOD1 mutations have been shown to induce SOD1 protein aggregates and mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pansarasa et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, we observed that both activation of a protein aggregate stress response pathway or mitochondrial dysfunction could induce a TAp63 response. This finding is supported by a previous report showing that <i>tp63</i> is an effector of the ER stress pathway in zebrafish allowing the regulation of the pro-apoptotic gene <i>bbc3</i> (puma) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pyati et al., 2011</a>)."

However, bioinformatic analyses did not reveal potential canonical binding sites for these transcription factors neither in promoters of TA isoforms of <i>P63</i> nor <i>P73</i>, suggesting that the regulation might occur through indirect mechanisms that remain to be identified."

Our study revealed that the majority of the p53/p63/p73 target genes upregulated during ALS in the atrophic muscles are connected to cell death (<i>Gadd45a, Peg3, Perp, Pmaip1, Bax, Siva, Eda2r, Wig1/Pag608</i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Genes connected to other functions, such as ER stress (<i>chop, bip, xbp1, scotin</i>) or energy metabolism (<i>Tigar, Sesn1, Sesn2, Sco2</i>) seem to be less consistently regulated, as some are upregulated (<i>Sesn1, Sesn2, Xbp1</i>), while others are downregulated (<i>Sco2, Tigar, Chop, Bip</i>, see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Therefore, it seems more likely that p53 family members, notably TAp63, function in ALS is connected to muscular atrophy via control of muscle cell survival and catabolism. This hypothesis is further supported by three of our results."

Second, overexpression of TAp63 induces cell death in C2C12 myoblasts (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Third, overexpression of \u25b3Np63 protects myoblastic cells against stresses (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although these results were obtained in a myoblastic cell line, they are consistent with numerous other studies describing the ability of p63 to control cell death in various pathophysiological conditions. To establish the exact pathophysiological importance of TAp63 upregulation in ALS represent a difficult challenge. Indeed, we already observed that in vitro the silencing of TAp63 with siRNA does not entirely abolish the expression of <i>Trim63</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) and does not significantly reduce cell death induced by stresses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This has several reasons. The first is that the expression of <i>Trim63</i> involves several transcription factors, such as FOXO1 and the glucocorticoid receptors that certainly participate in the regulation of <i>Trim63</i> during ALS. Indeed, the coordinated silencing of p53, TAp63 and TAp73 did not completely abolish <i>Trim63</i> RNA levels (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), supporting the involvement of other types of transcription factors. The second reason is intrinsic to the p53 family. Indeed, we already know that p53, p63 and p73 have some redundant functions and target genes. We have also already established that p53 and p73 are expressed in muscles during the pathology (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig4s2\">2</a>) and also bind to the <i>Trim63</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore in absence of TAp63, p53 and/or TAp73 might replace it in some conditions. For example, we observed an upregulation of TAp73 in C2C12 cells when TAp63 is silenced. This compensatory mechanism might therefore also explain why TAp63 siRNA do not protect C2C12 cells from death, in contrast to the expression of the \u25b3Np63 isoform that could inhibit p53, TAp73 and TAp63 function altogether (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The results presented here suggest that p53 family members, via the regulation of selected target genes such as <i>Eda2r, Peg3</i> but also, as we show, via <i>Trim63</i>, might contribute to muscle catabolism in these patients. It remains to be established whether this signalling pathway is uniquely critical for muscular atrophy during ALS or whether it is common to other muscular atrophies occurring in pathologies such as cachexia, diabetes, and others."

Using gene expression meta-analyses in ALS patients they discovered that several p53 family target genes were strongly upregulated and the extent of their upregulation correlated with severity of the disease as measured by degree of muscle injury. Similar results were seen in muscles of SOD1 (G86R) mice. Of the different p53 family that were assayed there was a strong increase specifically in TAp63 and the authors conclude that of the p53 family, it is this isoform that is responsible for the upregulation of these genes. They test this by performing sciatic nerve crush experiments and show that this causes a huge increase in TAp63 and expression of p21 and GADD45a target genes. In fact they also find that levels of the p63 delta N isoform (that in some settings counteracts the TA isoform) actually decrease in this experimental setting. They then identify <i>murf1</i>, a gene whose product has been shown to be involved in muscle atrophy as a p63 target gene and provide evidence that of the various p53 family member isoforms, TAp63 is the strongest inducer of this gene in C2C12 myoblasts, cells that were used so that transfection experiments could be performed in a relevant muscle cell line. They also provide evidence that upon siRNA mediated knock-down of p63, there is a significant reduction in expression of <i>murf</i>1 in these cells."

Since the p53 family proteins and their major targets are involved in apoptosis and other related cellular response, it is likely that one of the mechanisms by which muscle atrophy is induced by abnormal apoptotic and other related responses. Overall this is a very interesting paper that links for the first time p63 and muscle degeneration and ALS. Although there are some gaps due to difficulties in obtaining muscle cell lines from patients, their data make a quite convincing case for the TA isoform of p63 being a factor in regulating muscle deterioration via up-regulation of <i>murf1</i>. This is a novel set of observations and the study is recommended to the journal with the condition that the authors can address most if not all the comments below:"

Indeed, using this antibody we succeeded in following p53 protein levels in protein extracts of muscles from WT and SOD1(G86R) mice, in contrast to our previous attempts with other antibodies. The new data show a slight increase in p53 protein levels, which encouraged us to further investigate the possible regulation of <i>murf1</i> by p53 (see above). Unfortunately and despite multiple attempts we did not succeed in showing any specific staining in muscle tissues using this antibody. The company (Cell Signaling) providing this antibody confirmed that it is not useful for immunohistochemistry with mouse tissues. It remains to establish the mechanism involved in the upregulation of p53 proteins levels. One hypothesis might be that the oxidative stress described in tissues during ALS might trigger canonical post-translational modifications of p53 and its stabilization as previously described for cisplatin for instance. In addition, the slight increase in p53 RNA levels might contribute to the induction of p53 protein levels. These points have been added to the Discussion."

We have now added data showing that at least ATF4 and ATF6 can contribute to the induction of TAp63 and TAp73 RNA level (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, bioinformatics did not allow us to locate any canonical binding sites for these transcription factors in TAp63 or TAp73 promoters, suggesting that the regulation might be indirect.
