Resurgent current results from unbinding of a blocking particle that competes with normal channel inactivation. The underlying molecular components contributing to resurgent current have not been fully identified. In this study, we show that the Na<sub>V</sub> channel auxiliary subunit FGF14 \u2018b\u2019 isoform, a locus for inherited spinocerebellar ataxias, controls resurgent current and repetitive firing in Purkinje neurons. FGF14 knockdown biased Na<sub>V</sub> channels towards the inactivated state by decreasing channel availability, diminishing the \u2018late\u2019 Na<sub>V</sub> current, and accelerating channel inactivation rate, thereby reducing resurgent current and repetitive spiking. Critical for these effects was both the alternatively spliced FGF14b N-terminus and direct interaction between FGF14b and the Na<sub>V</sub> C-terminus. Together, these data suggest that the FGF14b N-terminus is a potent regulator of resurgent Na<sub>V</sub> current in cerebellar Purkinje neurons."

Resurgent current results from unbinding of a blocking particle that competes with normal channel inactivation. The underlying molecular components contributing to resurgent current have not been fully identified. In this study, we show that the Na<sub>V</sub> channel auxiliary subunit FGF14 \u2018b\u2019 isoform, a locus for inherited spinocerebellar ataxias, controls resurgent current and repetitive firing in Purkinje neurons. FGF14 knockdown biased Na<sub>V</sub> channels towards the inactivated state by decreasing channel availability, diminishing the \u2018late\u2019 Na<sub>V</sub> current, and accelerating channel inactivation rate, thereby reducing resurgent current and repetitive spiking. Critical for these effects was both the alternatively spliced FGF14b N-terminus and direct interaction between FGF14b and the Na<sub>V</sub> C-terminus. Together, these data suggest that the FGF14b N-terminus is a potent regulator of resurgent Na<sub>V</sub> current in cerebellar Purkinje neurons."

Messages travel along neurons as electrical signals carried by sodium ions, which have a positive electric charge. Normally, when a neuron is \u2018at rest\u2019, the plasma membrane that surrounds the neuron prevents the sodium ions outside the cell from entering. To send an electrical signal, voltage-sensitive proteins in the membrane called sodium channels open up. This allows the sodium ions to enter the cell by passing through a pore in the channel protein, thereby changing the voltage across the membrane."

The molecular components underlying the peculiar properties of Na<sub>V</sub> channels in Purkinje neurons have not been definitively identified."

                        "text": "Several features of Na<sub>V</sub> currents in cerebellar Purkinje neurons, however, set them apart from Na<sub>V</sub> currents recorded in other neurons. First, more than half of the Na<sub>V</sub> current in Purkinje neurons is carried by Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, an isoform for which inactivation is less complete compared to other Na<sub>V</sub> channels (<a href=\"#bib23\">Raman et al., 1997</a>). Examination of Na<sub>V</sub> currents in cerebellar Purkinje neurons from <i>Scn8a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice showed that, compared to the other resident Na<sub>V</sub> channels, the <i>Scn8a</i>-encoded Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels have a relatively large \u2018late\u2019 (non-inactivating) component and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels have increased availability (depolarized V<sub>1/2</sub> for steady-state inactivation). Second, Na<sub>V</sub> channels in cerebellar Purkinje neurons display an unusual transient re-opening during repolarization, which is identified as \u2018resurgent\u2019 Na<sub>V</sub> current (<a href=\"#bib21\">Raman and Bean, 1997</a>). This resurgent current derives from an unblocking of open channels by a peptide moiety that can be eliminated by the intracellular application of trypsin or chymotrypsin proteases into the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib8\">Grieco et al., 2005</a>). The blocking particle acts only on open channels and competes with the inactivation process to prevent channels from entering an absorbed, inactivated state. During action potential repolarization, unblocking of these channels then allows Na<sup>+</sup> influx that can initiate a subsequent action potential (<a href=\"#bib13\">Khaliq et al., 2003</a>). Since the Na<sub>V</sub> current in Purkinje neurons carried by Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 is relatively resistant to inactivation, it is particularly susceptible to open block by the peptide moiety. Why Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels in cerebellar Purkinje neurons are relatively resistant to inactivation, however, is unknown."

FGF14 is one of four fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs), members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) superfamily sharing a FGF-like core but having extended N- and C-termini not found in other FGFs. Individual FHFs undergo alternative splicing that generates distinct N-termini, none of which contain a signal sequence (<a href=\"#bib26\">Smallwood et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Munoz-Sanjuan et al., 2000</a>). Thus, unlike other FGFs they are not secreted and do not function as growth factors (<a href=\"#bib26\">Smallwood et al., 1996</a>). Instead, FHFs remain intracellular and modulate various ion channels. FHFs can bind directly to the cytoplasmic C-terminal domains (CTDs) of Na<sub>V</sub> channels (<a href=\"#bib17\">Liu et al., 2001</a>) and regulate Na<sub>V</sub> channel function (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lou et al., 2005</a>). Further, FGF14 is a potent regulator of both Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lou et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Laezza et al., 2009</a>), the two dominant Na<sub>V</sub> channels in cerebellar Purkinje neurons (<a href=\"#bib23\">Raman et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Kalume et al., 2007</a>). FHFs also regulate voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels through a mechanism that does not appear to involve a direct interaction (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hennessey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Yan et al., 2013</a>). An ataxia phenotype in <i>Fgf14</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice highlights the role of FGF14 in cerebellar physiology and the development of spinocerebellar ataxia type 27 (SCA27) in patients with either FGF14 haploinsufficiency or a dominant negative <i>FGF14</i> mutation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">van Swieten et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Dalski et al., 2005</a>) underscores the role of FGF14 in disease."

When we co-expressed a FGF14b cDNA with synonymous substitutions rendering it resistant to the FGF14 shRNA (FGF14b<sup>WT</sup>), the V<sub>1/2</sub> of steady-state inactivation was restored to the control voltage; activation was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

The alternatively spliced N-termini of various FHFs have been shown to exert specific effects on Na<sub>V</sub> currents (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lou et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Rush et al., 2006</a>), including the regulation of inactivation kinetics (<a href=\"#bib15\">Laezza et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Dover et al., 2010</a>), but the role of the FGF14 N-termini have not been investigated in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. FGF14b is the predominant FGF14 splice variant expressed in brain (<a href=\"#bib28\">Wang et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2011</a>) and the FGF14 splice variant found in the cytoplasm; FGF14a is localized to the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib28\">Wang et al., 2000</a>). To test the specific roles of the FGF14b N-terminus, we expressed a FGF14 in which the N-terminus was deleted (FGF14\u0394<sup>NT</sup>). Because the interaction site for the Na<sub>V</sub> CTD on FHFs lies within the conserved core domain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Wang et al., 2012</a>), deletion of the N-terminus does not affect interaction with the Na<sub>V</sub> CTD. Thus, the FGF14\u0394<sup>NT</sup> exerts a dominant negative effect by competing with endogenous FGF14 for interaction with the Na<sub>V</sub> CTD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Current density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and the V<sub>1/2</sub> of activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) were unaffected. However, expression of FGF14\u0394<sup>NT</sup> shifted the V<sub>1/2</sub> of steady-state inactivation about \u221210 mV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), accelerated kinetics of inactivation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), reduced the late Na<sub>V</sub> current (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), and diminished resurgent current (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) to a degree similar to or even greater than shRNA knockdown. FGF14\u0394<sup>NT</sup> diminished resurgent Na<sub>V</sub> current even more effectively than shRNA knockdown of FGF14. As a control, we overexpressed the FGF14b<sup>WT</sup> that had rescued the parameters affected by shRNA knockdown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Overexpression of FGF14b<sup>WT</sup> here was without effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Not only did this serve as a control for FGF14\u0394<sup>NT</sup>, but these data suggest that endogenous FGF14b is saturating. These data also suggest that FGF14b's main regulatory component for Purkinje neuron Na<sub>V</sub> currents lies within the FGF14b N-terminus."

To test this hypothesis specifically, we designed a FGF14b that was unable to bind to the channel CTD and examined whether expression of this mutant could restore the diminished resurgent current resulting from shRNA knockdown of FGF14. Structural determination of a ternary complex containing FGF13, the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 CTD, and calmodulin had identified key amino acids on the conserved FHF interaction surface that participated in the interaction with the conserved Na<sub>V</sub> CTD surface (<a href=\"#bib31\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). We focused on a highly conserved Arg in the FHF core domain (Arg57 in FGF13U, equivalent to Arg117 in FGF14b), which inserts into a deep pocket on the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 CTD binding surface (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We therefore generated the homologous R117A mutant (FGF14b<sup>R/A</sup>) in the FGF14b shRNA-resistant cDNA background and tested whether FGF14b<sup>R/A</sup> could bind to the intact Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. Although immunoprecipitation of FGF14b<sup>WT</sup> from lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with FGF14b<sup>WT</sup> and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 showed co-immunoprecipitation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, the mutant FGF14b<sup>R/A</sup> was unable to co-immunoprecipitate Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, mutation of R117A in FGF14b prevents interaction with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. We therefore transfected the shRNA-resistant FGF14b<sup>R/A</sup> (or the shRNA-resistant FGF14b<sup>WT</sup>) along with the FGF14 shRNA into cultured cerebellar Purkinje neurons to determine the effect of FGF14 interaction with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 on Na<sub>V</sub> currents. Expression of FGF14b<sup>R/A</sup> after shRNA knockdown of endogenous FGF14 had no effect on Na<sub>V</sub> current density (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In contrast to the rescue afforded by FGF14b<sup>WT</sup>, FGF14b<sup>R/A</sup> did not rescue the key parameters that lead to increased inactivation observed after FGF14 shRNA. Na<sub>V</sub> late current and the time constant of inactivation were not different from shRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>). Consistent with these findings, we observed the expected reduction in resurgent Na<sub>V</sub> current (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013H</a>). Thus, the FGF14 N-terminus must exert its key effects through FGF14's direct interaction with the Na<sub>V</sub> C-terminus."

We tested this hypothesis by determining the effects of the FGF14 and its N-terminus on action potential threshold and on the number of action potentials evoked with depolarizing current injections in current-clamp mode. Under our culture conditions (\u226414 days in vitro), we found that 8\u201310% of cerebellar Purkinje neurons exhibit spontaneous action potentials (firing rate 5\u201320 Hz) with regular and irregular patterns. When neurons were cultured for extended periods (&gt;20 days in vitro), we observed that \u223c50% of Purkinje neurons spontaneously fired\u2014more similar to acutely isolated Purkinje neurons (<a href=\"#bib22\">Raman and Bean, 1999</a>) and cultured Purkinje neurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gruol and Franklin, 1987</a>). These data suggest that spontaneous activity depends upon the maturity of the neurons in culture. Because of the difficulty in achieving voltage clamp on Purkinje neurons \u226514 days in vitro, our voltage-clamp experiments were performed on the younger cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2\u20134</a>). Thus, we continued with immature neurons for these experiments, and focused on measuring evoked action potentials rather than spontaneous action potentials. Single action potentials were evoked by a 10-ms current injection with 5-pA increments to determine the current threshold to initiate an action potential. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> show that FGF14 knockdown and expression of the dominant negative FGF14b\u0394<sup>NT</sup> markedly increased the current threshold to produce an action potential; other action potential parameters were not affected. Rescue of FGF14 knockdown by co-expression of FGF14b<sup>WT</sup> restored the current threshold to control levels. Rescue with the non-interacting FGF14b<sup>R/A</sup> did not. We also analyzed the number of actions evoked during 600 ms current injection over a wide range of current amplitudes. The number of action potentials evoked was significantly larger in control (scrambled shRNA) neurons than in neurons transfected with FGF14 shRNA. Rescue with FGF14b<sup>WT</sup>, but not FGF14b<sup>R/A</sup>, restored the number of evoked action potentials to control levels. Expression of the dominant negative FGF14b\u0394<sup>NT</sup> reduced the number of evoked action potentials to the level observed after FGF14 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a>). Thus, as observed for the individual Na<sub>V</sub> channel kinetic parameters, FGF14b, and its N-terminus specifically, is a critical regulator of neuronal firing and intrinsic membrane properties."

Here, we found that FGF14b in cerebellar Purkinje neurons affects multiple kinetic parameters of Na<sub>V</sub> channels, thereby reducing the resurgent Na<sub>V</sub> current that underlies repetitive firing. Together, the accelerated inactivation, reduced channel availability, and decreased late current observed after FGF14 knockdown bias Na<sub>V</sub> channels to the inactivated state. Thus, the blocking particle that competes with the inactivation gate for open Na<sub>V</sub> channels is disadvantaged. Consequently, the resurgent current, and the resulting ability to support repetitive firing in Purkinje neurons, is reduced as we observed. Thus, our data show that an essential regulatory feature of FGF14 in cerebellar Purkinje neurons is to slow Na<sub>V</sub> channel inactivation in order to foster resurgent current."

Nevertheless, the actions of Na<sub>V</sub>\u03b24 are not sufficient to generate resurgent Na<sub>V</sub> current (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aman et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that other components of the Na<sub>V</sub> channel complex may be necessary for proper regulation of resurgent Na<sub>V</sub> current in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Here, our knockdown experiments and expression of the dominant negative FGF14b\u0394<sup>NT</sup> show that FGF14b, and specifically its N-terminus, strongly influence resurgent Na<sub>V</sub> current. FGF14 knockdown caused a \u223c60% reduction. Expression of FGF14\u0394<sup>NT</sup> was even more efficient, resulting in a \u223c85% reduction, perhaps because overexpression of FGF14\u0394<sup>NT</sup> was more efficient in replacing endogenous FGF14b than shRNA knockdown was in eliminating endogenous FGF14b. Thus, FGF14 may cooperate with Na<sub>V</sub>\u03b24 to generate resurgent current, perhaps by biasing Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels towards inactivation and thereby disadvantaging the blocking particle. Our results examining effects on total Na<sub>V</sub> current must be assessed in the context of FGF14 effects not only on Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels but also on Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 channel, the other major source of Na<sub>V</sub> currents in cerebellar Purkinje neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kalume et al., 2007</a>). Those Na<sub>V</sub> channels are also influence by FGF14 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lou et al., 2005</a>).

Studying FHFs in their native cellular context appears to be crucial for defining their specific roles. Previous investigations of FGF14-dependent regulation of neuronal Na<sub>V</sub> channels in heterologous expression systems led to different conclusions from experiments in neurons. For example, expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and FGF14b<sup>WT</sup> in ND7/23 cells almost eliminated Na<sub>V</sub> current density (<a href=\"#bib15\">Laezza et al., 2009</a>) while overexpression of FGF14b<sup>WT</sup> in hippocampal neurons increased Na<sub>V</sub> current density (<a href=\"#bib14\">Laezza et al., 2007</a>).

While the etiology of the different results in neurons compared to heterologous expression systems is not known, we speculate that additional regulatory factors present in neurons are necessary for physiologic regulation of Na<sub>V</sub> channels by FHFs. Indeed, we have observed similarly disparate results for the related FGF13 and the cardiac Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channel. In HEK293 cells, FGF13 co-expression reduces Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 current density (not shown), but we showed that the role FGF13 in cardiomyocytes is to increase Na<sub>V</sub> current density (<a href=\"#bib30\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Hennessey et al., 2013</a>)."

Whole-cell Na<sub>V</sub> currents and membrane voltage were recorded at 23\u201325\u00b0C using an EPC 10 USB patch amplifier (HEKA Elektronik). The signal was filtered at 2.9 Hz and digitized at 20 Hz. Na<sub>V</sub> currents were recorded with an extracellular solution containing (in mM) 124 NaCl, 20 TEA-Cl (tetraethylammonium Chloride), 5 HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), 10 glucose, 0.3 CdCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 BaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 4-AP (4-aminopyridine). NaOH was added to achieve pH 7.3 (300\u2013310 mOsm). Borosilicate glass patch pipettes (resistances within 3\u20134 M\u03a9) were filled with the following internal solution (in mM): 125 CsF, 10 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 15 TEA-Cl, 1.1 ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), and 0.5 Na-guanosine-5\u2032-triphosphate (Na-GTP), pH adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH (290\u2013300 mOsm). Tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na<sub>V</sub> currents were isolated by subtraction of recordings performed in 1 \u03bcM TTX from the control recordings. Series resistance was compensated &gt;70%. Current-clamp recordings were performed after obtaining seal resistances &gt;1.2 G\u03a9. The internal solution was (in mM) 130 K-gluconate, 5 NaCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.5 Na-GTP, 0.2 EGTA, and 10 phosphocreatine. KOH was used to obtain pH 7.3 (290\u2013300 mOsm).

Resting membrane potential was directly measured in current-clamp mode after membrane rupture and only cells with a resting membrane potential more negative than \u221250 mV were studied. The liquid junction potential was not corrected. Input resistance was determined from membrane voltage deflection, evoked by 600-ms hyperpolarizing current injections (0 to \u2212300 pA in steps of 50 pA) and calculated from the measured slope. Single action potentials were elicited by 10 ms depolarizing current injections with 5-pA increments. All drugs were from Sigma Aldrich, except for TTX (Abcam Biochemicals)."

Statistical significance was determined using Student's <i>t</i> or one-way ANOVA tests. Calculated p values of \u22640.05 were accepted as evidence of statistically significant differences. For current amplitude, neurons were held at \u221290 mV and transient Na<sub>V</sub> current was elicited by depolarizing pulses of 20 ms from \u221290 mV to +55 mV in 5-mV increments. Current density was obtained by normalizing peak Na<sub>V</sub> current to membrane capacitance. Resurgent Na<sub>V</sub> current was evoked with repolarizing steps from +20 mV to a range of voltages between \u221280 mV and +5 mV in 5-mV increments for a 200-ms test pulse after 15 ms conditioning steps. Na<sub>V</sub> activation curves were obtained by transforming current data to conductance (G), with the equation G = <i>I</i><sub>Na</sub>/(E<sub>m</sub> \u2212 E<sub>rev</sub>), where: <i>I</i><sub>Na</sub> is the peak current; E<sub>m</sub> is the membrane potential; and E<sub>rev</sub> is the reversal potential of <i>I</i><sub>Na</sub>; and fitted with a Boltzmann equation of the form: G = G<sub>max</sub>/[1 + exp(<i>V</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub> <i>\u2212 V</i>)/<i>k</i>], where G<sub>max</sub> is the extrapolated maximum Na<sup>+</sup> conductance, V is the test voltage, V<sub>1/2</sub> is the half-activation voltage, and <i>k</i> is the slope factor. For Na<sub>V</sub> steady-state inactivation, a voltage step to \u221220 mV for 20 ms was applied from a holding potential of \u221290 mV to preferentially activate <i>I</i><sub>Na</sub> after pre-pulse conditioning voltage steps of 300 ms in duration (ranging from \u221290 to +20 mV) in 5-mV increments. Steady-state inactivation curves were constructed by plotting the normalized peak current amplitude elicited during the test pulse as a function of the conditioning pre-pulse. A Boltzmann relationship, <i>I</i>/<i>I</i><sub>max</sub> = (1 + exp((<i>V</i> \u2212 <i>V</i><sub>1/2</sub>)/<i>k</i>))<sup>\u22121</sup> was used to fit the data where <i>I</i><sub>max</sub> is current elicited by the test pulse after a \u221290-mV prepulse; <i>V</i><sub>1/2</sub> is half-inactivation voltage; <i>k</i> is the slope. Late Na<sub>V</sub> current was measured at 150 ms during a 200 ms depolarizing pulse to \u221220 mV. The rate of decay of the transient Na<sub>V</sub> current (\u03c4) was obtained from a single exponential function, <i>I</i><sub><i>(t)</i></sub> = <i>I</i><sub><i>Na</i></sub> exp <sup>(\u2212t/\u03c4)</sup>+ <i>I</i><sub><i>SS</i></sub>, where <i>I</i><sub><i>(t)</i></sub> is the amplitude of the current at time <i>t</i>; <i>I</i><sub><i>SS</i></sub> is the steady-state current during a single voltage step."

Lysate was incubated on ice for 2 hr, passed through a 20g needle 20 times, and rocked end over end for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The lysate was cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 4000 rcf at 4\u00b0C for 30 min followed by a second centrifugation at 17,100 rcf at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. The lysate was preincubated with 30 \u03bcl of Protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) beads for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C.

As you will see the reviewers thought the data was convincing in showing that the intracellular protein FGF14, which has previously been shown to interact with sodium channels, regulates the ability of the channels to generate \u201cresurgent\u201d sodium current, an unusual kinetic behavior of sodium channels linked to rapid firing, whereby sodium current flows during recovery from inactivation. The experiments are based on combined shRNA and dominant negative protein experiments using a preparation of cultured Purkinje neurons. This is a powerful combination of molecular tools and physiological function. The implication of FGF14 in resurgent current is of considerable significance, especially because mutations affecting FGF14 are implicated in some human spinocerebellar ataxias."

These studies are not a dramatic conceptual advance, but the analysis presented here is more comprehensive and carefully documented than previous work and significantly increases our understanding of FGF-14 effects. The weakness of this manuscript is the interpretation of the regulatory effects observed in molecular terms. As the authors acknowledge, the molecular components required for resurgent sodium current remain unknown, and the molecular mechanism of generation of resurgent current is not substantially advanced by the work presented here. Specifically, no evidence was presented to support the authors' proposal that FGF14 serves as a blocking particle and thus the discussion of the molecular mechanism throughout the manuscript (Abstract, Introduction, Figure 6 and Discussion) should be removed as commented below."

The culture preparation is necessary to do these experiments, but addressing these points is important because the data suggest that the cultured neurons do not fire spontaneously (Methods, \u201conly cells with a resting membrane potential more negative than -50 mV were studied\u201d; no indication of holding current to keep cells silent; no spikes evident before steps in current clamp records. Note the extracellular solution for recording spikes is also not reported), and if the authors wish to make a case that FGF14 affects Purkinje cell firing the link to the more physiological condition should be made."

Because any modulation that favors inactivation will reduce resurgent current, the observed reduction in peak resurgent current is predicted, though still worth documenting. The Results are presented quite clearly, but in the second paragraph of the Discussion the authors surprisingly and unnecessarily extrapolate to the suggestion that FGF14 is itself a blocker or forms part of a blocking complex.

Because of the high sequence conservation among the FHFs and separately among the Na<sub>V</sub>1.x C termini, we believe that the FGF13-Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 model is relevant for Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and FGF14. We agree with the Reviewer, however, that a demonstration that the FGF14b<sup>R/A</sup> mutant cannot bind Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 will enhance our manuscript. Therefore, we expressed either FGF14b or mutant FGF14b<sup>R/A</sup> with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in HEK cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation studies. As we now show in the new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, FGF14b<sup>R/A</sup> does not co-immunoprecipitate with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, demonstrating that the intact FGF14b<sup>R/A</sup> does not interact with the intact Na<sub>V</sub>1.6."

There is no experimental basis for the interaction between the Navbeta4 subunit and FGF14 depicted in Figure 6, and indeed the role of Navbeta4 as a blocking protein has yet to be demonstrated for Purkinje cells. Similarly, the authors indicate that FHF-14 also is unable to generate resurgent sodium current when co-expressed with sodium channels, so there is no experimental basis for its proposed role as a blocking particle that generates resurgent sodium current either. If the authors wish to propose this molecular mechanism, they need to show that co-expression of Navbeta4, FHF-14, or both can generate resurgent sodium current in a cell type in which none is observed before co-expression</i>."
