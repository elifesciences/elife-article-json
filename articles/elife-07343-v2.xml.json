                    "text": "Evolutionary origin of muscle is a central question when discussing mesoderm evolution. Developmental mechanisms underlying somatic muscle development have mostly been studied in vertebrates and fly where multiple signals and hierarchic genetic regulatory cascades selectively specify myoblasts from a pool of naive mesodermal progenitors. However, due to the increased organismic complexity and distant phylogenetic position of the two systems, a general mechanistic understanding of myogenesis is still lacking. In this study, we propose a gene regulatory network (GRN) model that promotes myogenesis in the sea urchin embryo, an early branching deuterostome. A fibroblast growth factor signaling and four Forkhead transcription factors consist the central part of our model and appear to orchestrate the myogenic process. The topological properties of the network reveal dense gene interwiring and a multilevel transcriptional regulation of conserved and novel myogenic genes. Finally, the comparison of the myogenic network architecture among different animal groups highlights the evolutionary plasticity of developmental GRNs."

Developmental mechanisms underlying somatic muscle development have mostly been studied in vertebrates and fly where multiple signals and hierarchic genetic regulatory cascades selectively specify myoblasts from a pool of naive mesodermal progenitors. However, due to the increased organismic complexity and distant phylogenetic position of the two systems, a general mechanistic understanding of myogenesis is still lacking. In this study, we propose a gene regulatory network (GRN) model that promotes myogenesis in the sea urchin embryo, an early branching deuterostome. A fibroblast growth factor signaling and four Forkhead transcription factors consist the central part of our model and appear to orchestrate the myogenic process. The topological properties of the network reveal dense gene interwiring and a multilevel transcriptional regulation of conserved and novel myogenic genes. Finally, the comparison of the myogenic network architecture among different animal groups highlights the evolutionary plasticity of developmental GRNs."

In bilaterians, muscles develop usually from mesodermal cells in a process called myogenesis, during which the naive mesodermal progenitors are selectively specified as myoblasts and later differentiate into muscle cells. In vertebrate embryos, the mesoderm is subdivided into several regions from which different muscle types originated. For example, the axial skeletal muscles originate in the segmented paraxial mesoderm called somites, whereas the cardiac muscles develop from the lateral plate mesoderm. The subdivisions of different mesoderm regions require differential expression of the Forkhead (Fox) family of transcription factors, such as FoxC1 and FoxC2 for the paraxial mesoderm (<a href=\"#bib88\">Wilm et al., 2004</a>) and FoxF1 for the lateral plate mesoderm (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mahlapuu et al., 2001</a>). Analyses of molecular mechanisms underlying myogenesis in various parts of the somites further lead to a series of complex gene regulatory networks (GRNs) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bryson-Richardson and Currie, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Yokoyama and Asahara, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bentzinger et al., 2012</a>). These networks are composed of multiple signals that drive the expression of the genes encoding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain-containing myogenic regulatory factors, which include myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD), myogenic factor 5 (Myf5), Myf6, and myogenin (Myog). Other factors, including the myocyte enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2) family of MADS-box proteins, transcription factors Pitx2, Pitx3, sine oculis-related homeobox (six) family members and their cofactors eyes-absent homologs (Eya), are also involved in specification and migration of the myogenic precursor cells (<a href=\"#bib57\">Molkentin and Olson, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Yokoyama and Asahara, 2011</a>). These myogenic transcriptional regulators then in turn initiate the transcription of muscle differentiation markers, such as myosin heavy chain proteins (MHC), that determine the morphological and functional identity of the differentiated muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bryson-Richardson and Currie, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bentzinger et al., 2012</a>)."

Among these signals, FGF-signaling pathway is of particular interest because it has a crucial and conserved role in mesoderm patterning and muscle development in various animal models. In vertebrates, FGF induces the expression of myogenic genes in the primary myotome, controls the timing of the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition of the dermomyotome, which triggers the emergence of muscle progenitors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Delfini et al., 2009</a>) and positively regulates muscle differentiation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Marics et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Groves et al., 2005</a>). In flies, an FGFR ortholog (<i>Heartless</i>)-mediated pathway is essential for cell migration and fate induction of the visceral mesoderm, heart, and the somatic muscle lineages (<a href=\"#bib9\">Beiman et al., 1996</a>). In ascidians, FGF signaling is required for the specification of the heart progenitor cells and secondary muscle development (<a href=\"#bib8\">Beh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Tokuoka et al., 2007</a>). In the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, the crosstalk between FGF and Wnt signals is involved in larval sex myoblast specification and migration (<a href=\"#bib15\">Burdine et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lo et al., 2008</a>). In the amphioxus <i>Brachiostoma lanceolatum</i>, FGF signaling is necessary for the formation of the anterior somites that will generate the musculature (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bertrand et al., 2011</a>) and in the hemichordate <i>Saccoglossus kowalevskii</i>, FGF signaling is necessary for all types of mesoderm development (<a href=\"#bib30\">Green et al., 2013</a>)."

However, due to the high complexity that characterizes the vertebrate organogenesis and the distant phylogenetic position between ecdysozoans and vertebrates, the logics behind the genomic regulatory interactions that drive muscle development remain unclear. Therefore, elucidating the properties of the key genetic interconnections that orchestrate myogenesis in a larger set of model organisms is necessary to reveal the core myogenic circuits. Moreover, given the fact that the common origin of musculature is a highly debated topic (<a href=\"#bib74\">Seipel and Schmid, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Burton, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Steinmetz et al., 2012</a>), a larger interspecies comparison of the transcriptional myogenic networks would provide new insights into the evolution of muscle and the kernel driven hypothesis."

Further functional analyses are needed to confirm the myogenic function of these transcription factors and to unravel the regulatory architecture of the muscle GRN. This study provides an explanatory mechanism on how the sea urchin muscle lineage is specified using a perturbation approach accompanied by a combination of temporal and spatial gene expression analyses. We show that FGF signaling is necessary for specifying naive NSM cells to myoblast precursors at the very early gastrula stage. The four Fox family factors FoxY, FoxC, FoxF, and FoxL1 (<a href=\"#bib83\">Tu et al., 2006</a>) constitute the central part of our myogenic GRN model and are activated sequentially. Other conserved key factors that occupy different hierarchical levels in the myogenic GRN are members of the T-box (Tbx6) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Howard-Ashby et al., 2006</a>), bHLH (MyoD2) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Andrikou et al., 2013</a>), SRY (Sox) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Howard-Ashby et al., 2006</a>), Scratch (ScratchX) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Materna et al., 2013</a>), and Six (Six1/2) (<a href=\"#bib65\">Poustka et al., 2007</a>) family genes. These findings imply an overall high level of functional conservation of both key myogenic transcriptional regulators and signaling components but not of the myogenic GRN architecture per se. Also, they explain in a rational way the logics and properties of the regulatory interactions that drive myogenesis in the sea urchin embryo."

To reveal the cause of myoblast emergence at the early gastrula stage, we searched for putative candidate signaling components that are expressed at that time in the myoblast precursors. As elsewhere demonstrated, a mesodermal Delta/Notch signal activates <i>FoxY,</i> which is required for the specification of the two mesoderm derivatives, coelomic pouches and muscles (<a href=\"#bib47\">Materna and Davidson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Materna et al., 2013</a>).

A summary of the phenotypes observed after inhibitor treatments is in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>. 70% of the 300 pluteus larvae treated with SU5402 from 26 hr showed an abnormal elongated archenteron missing the pyloric and possibly the anal sphincter constrictions, although the cardiac sphincter was still formed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>) suggesting that the three distinct sphincters are differentially regulated (<a href=\"#bib5\">Annunziata and Arnone, 2014</a>). Moreover, all larvae had shorter spicules and their triradiate skeleton was never fully shaped possibly due to the inhibition of FGFR2, which is specifically expressed in the skeletogenic primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) that produce the larval skeleton (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rottinger et al., 2008</a>). Finally, the coelomic pouches were not formed and the circumesophagael muscle fibers were completely absent when tested for <i>MHC</i> gene expression by FISH at the prism stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). To reveal the downstream cascade of the FGF signaling, we used the MEK inhibitor U0126. In one of our previous studies, we showed that MAPK/ERK activation is required for muscle formation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fernandez-Serra et al., 2004</a>). We repeated the experiment by treating the embryos with U0126 at 26 hr, as we did with the SU5402 inhibitor. The treated larvae were tested again for the presence of muscle fibers by examining the MHC protein level using immunostaining. Again, the level of MHC protein was greatly reduced in the treated larvae (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>).

The MO toxicity and efficacy were examined by using a control MO and a GFP fusion construct, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although in 90% of the morphant larvae, a malformation of coelomic pouches (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) and a severe down-regulation of the MHC protein level were evident (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>), two different phenotypes concerning the compartmentalization of the archenteron were observed. 70% of the larvae displayed a fully elongated gut, with the cardiac and anal sphincters well formed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), while in the rest cases both sphincters were absent or partly formed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). In addition, an abnormal extension of cilia in the apical ectoderm was observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> insert) that provides a putative additional role of FGFR1 in patterning the apical organ (Paola Oliveri, personal communication) consistent with the expression of <i>FGFR1</i> in the apical domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). An evident reduction of the cilia in the gut lumen is also observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), which may be related to the FGFR1 expression seen in the endoderm during gastrulation (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Moreover, the larval skeleton and the formation of pigment cells were not affected, confirming that FGFR1 is not involved either in PMC patterning and subsequent skeleton formation or in pigment cell development (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). An even more severe phenotype was obtained by injecting the embryos with the mRNA encoding FGFR1 Dn with the cardiac and anal sphincters being absent in 60% of the cases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). As expected, MHC levels were greatly reduced whilst the same abnormal extension of cilia in the apical ectoderm and the reduction of the cilia in the gut lumen were observed. Taking together, these experiments not only demonstrate clearly an essential role of FGF signaling through FGFR1 in sea urchin myogenesis but also suggest its possible involvement in the formation of the ciliated gut epithelium and the ciliary ectoderm."

In order to understand whether ETS-domain-containing transcriptional regulators are likely to be the downstream effector of the MAPK pathway leading to <i>FoxC</i> and <i>FoxF</i> transcription in presumptive myoblasts, we searched for ETS family factors that are significantly expressed in the NSM at the very early gastrula stage. From the 11 members of the ETS gene family that are present in the sea urchin genome, only 3 are expressed in the NSM at 30 hr; <i>Elk</i>, <i>Erg</i>, and <i>Ets1/</i>2 (<a href=\"#bib70\">Rizzo et al., 2006</a>). We performed an immunostaining experiment on the phosphorylated active form of Elk (P-Elk) and double FISH of <i>FoxC</i> and <i>Erg</i> or <i>Ets1/2</i>. The spatial localization of P-Elk protein seemed to be excluded from the myogenic cells, when comparing it to the expression pattern of <i>FoxC</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>), suggesting that P-Elk is probably not the candidate effector of MAPK involved in myoblast specification. <i>Erg</i> expression was also not coincided with <i>FoxC</i> transcripts at 30 hr (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>), thus, indicating that this factor is also not the downstream effector. On the other hand, <i>Ets1/2</i> expression showed a clear co-localization with <i>FoxC</i> transcripts at around 30 hr (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3E,F</a>) that perfectly corresponds to the onset of myogenesis, suggesting a putative role of Ets1/2 as one of the terminal effectors of MAPK pathway acting during myoblast specification.

At the mid gastrula stage, <i>Six1/2</i> expression partially overlapped with that of <i>FoxC</i> in the oral mesodermal domain (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This transient expression seems to be correlated with the transcription of a late isoform whose peak of expression was seen at 42 hr (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>).

In 80% of the <i>Six1/2</i> morphants, the archenteron was elongated but not differentiated, the coelomic pouches were absent, and the MHC level was decreased (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Interestingly, unlike what previously shown by using an MO against the early isoform of <i>Six1/2,</i> which negatively affects pigmentation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Ransick and Davidson, 2012</a>), embryos injected with the MO targeted to the late <i>Six1/2</i> isoform were fully pigmented (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>)<i>.</i> Finally, 95% of <i>Tbx6</i> morphants had a milder phenotype, with no signs of malformed coelomic pouches and only a partial disrupted muscle fiber assembly as shown by MHC immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Similar phenotypes were observed when injecting a second MO against <i>Six1/2</i> and <i>Tbx6</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The above experiments demonstrate an important role of MyoD2 and the late isoform of Six1/2 as well as a limited role of Tbx6 in sea urchin muscle development, thus, suggesting that Tbx6 acts in a redundant manner with other factors, a known property of T-box factors (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gentsch et al., 2013</a>).

For NanoString analyses, we used a code set containing probes for most known NSM factors expressed at these developmental stages and a number of signaling components. The MO effects on transcript levels analyzed using the three methods were mostly consistent. For quantitative analyses using QPCR and Nanostring (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), changes in the transcript level were considered significant if the effect between control and MO injected embryos is more than twofolds.

                                "text": "A key finding of this work was the recruitment of FGF signal in myoblast specification. FGF-signaling cascade is reported to trigger the emergence and/or promote the expansion of muscle lineage progenitors in different organisms and probably possessed an ancestral role in mesoderm patterning (at least in deuterostomes), along with other developmental processes. Genes encoding FGF and FGFR were already present in the last common ancestor of all metazoans, but the origin of the FGF/FGFR couple appears to be an innovation specific to the Eumetazoa, potentially linked to the increase of animal complexity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bertrand et al., 2014</a>). The acquisition of diverse roles and functions of FGF signaling occurred with the expansion of FGF and FGFR families during evolution (<a href=\"#bib36\">Itoh and Ornitz, 2011</a>). For example, vertebrates are known to have the largest number of FGF-signaling components due to the two whole-genome duplication events (22 ligands and four receptors). FGF signals are involved in various developmental contexts (e.g., somitogenesis, cancer, gastrulation, metabolism, neural induction, etc) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dorey and Amaya, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Oki et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Naiche et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ko et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Neugebauer and Yost, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Sandhu et al., 2014</a>). Similar situations have been observed in <i>Drosophila</i> where the moderate expansions of both FGFR (<i>breathless</i> and <i>heartless</i>) and FGF (<i>Pyramus</i> [<i>Pyr</i>], <i>Thisbe</i> [<i>Ths</i>], and <i>Branchless</i> [<i>Bnl</i>]) families resulted in different biological functions such as cell\u2013cell interactions during mesoderm layer formation, caudal visceral muscle formation, tracheal morphogenesis, and glia differentiation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Muha and Muller, 2013</a>). In echinoderms, the two paralogues FGFR1 and FGFR2 are involved in two distinct developmental processes: myoblast specification (this study) and PMC migration (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rottinger et al., 2008</a>), respectively. Diverse functions of FGF signaling seen among different animal taxa suggest that this signaling system is redeployed at different levels of GRN hierarchy and acquire new functions in developmental and physiological processes. Moreover, the hierarchical position of FGF signaling seems to depend on the level of complexity of the developmental process placing it as a \u2018checkpoint\u2019 in a non-conserved way regarding its downstream targets, a known property of GRN \u2018plug-in\u2019 devices defined previously (<a href=\"#bib22\">Davidson, 2010</a>). The functional importance of being attachable onto any kind of circuitry reflects the need of developmental GRNs to adopt factors that act as turn on/off apparatuses, resulting in change of the undefined cell regulatory state to their specific cell lineage."

D/N signaling is known to be effective in cells being in direct contact with the ligand-producing cells (<a href=\"#bib86\">Wang, 2011</a>).

All factors belonging to this group are highly interconnected and provide multiple inputs to their downstream targets. On the same level of the GRN, immediately adjacent to the core, stands the intermediate layer of the network composed of the <i>FoxF</i> and <i>FoxL1</i> transcriptional effectors.

The Fox family of transcription factors is an ancient gene family and it has been proposed that its evolutionary origin occurred in a clade of unicellular organisms (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baldauf, 1999</a>). This family has expanded over time through multiple duplication events, and sometimes through gene loss, and resulted in over 40 members in vertebrates, grouped in 23 subclasses (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hannenhalli and Kaestner, 2009</a>). Among them, FoxC, FoxF, and FoxL subfamilies are of particular interest because they are clustered in most metazoan genomes and usually involved in mesoderm specification/differentiation processes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Mazet et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Shimeld et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, a linked activation or an overlapping expression has been reported in some cases, as in vertebrates, where FoxC specifies the dorsal mesoderm and derivatives, while FoxF patterns the lateral mesoderm and derivatives (<a href=\"#bib8\">Beh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Zinzen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Fritzenwanker et al., 2014</a>). In the sea urchin, where a cluster of <i>FoxC</i>, <i>FoxF</i>, and <i>FoxL1</i> genes is present (<a href=\"#bib4\">Andrikou et al., 2013</a>), we witness a similar regulatory logic where the different Fox factors pattern in an overlapping fashion in different compartments of the coelomic pouches. This cluster was probably expressed initially in developing mesodermal tissues and further evolved in regulating the specification and compartmentalization of mesodermal derivatives. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of the hierarchical position of the Fox family factors in the GRN. The expression patterns and sequential activation of <i>FoxC, FoxF</i>, and <i>FoxL1</i> genes in time reflect the linkage properties of the retained cluster: among the three genes, <i>FoxC</i> is the first to be turned on in the myogenic lineage and is necessary for the activation of the downstream factors <i>FoxF</i> and <i>FoxL1,</i> which are inter-regulated. The outcome of such complex inter-wiring GRN may contribute to the establishment of a more robust output, able to mask putative perturbations of single nodes, as recently proposed (<a href=\"#bib43\">Macneil and Walhout, 2011</a>)."

By 24 hr post fertilization, the separation of the different NSM regulatory states is defined. The vegetal plate of the embryo consists of four distinct NSM cell populations: the aboral part that occupies about two-thirds of the total cells will differentiate into the pigment cells; the oral part that consists of the remaining one-third of the total cells will become the blastocoelar cells; the four SMs in the center are primordial germ cells; approximately 2\u20133 cells in the oral/lateral domain of the periphery of the vegetal plate will give rise to the myoblast precursors. As showed elsewhere, the specification of the distinct NSM domains depends on D/N and Nodal signals (<a href=\"#bib75\">Sherwood and McClay, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Ransick and Davidson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Duboc et al., 2010</a>). At 9 hr post fertilization, Delta ligand produced by the skeletogenic mesoderm activates a D/N cascade, which subsequently initiates <i>Gcm</i> and <i>GataE</i> transcription in all NSM cells (<a href=\"#bib66\">Ransick and Davidson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2007</a>). Later, at 24 hr, the NSM GRN becomes regionalized into distinct oral and aboral NSM GRNs in consequence of Nodal signaling through the immediate expression of a Nodal target, <i>Not</i>, in the oral NSM. This causes the repression of the aboral GRN in the oral NSM cells, and the aboral NSM cells still express <i>Gcm</i> and <i>Gat</i>aE as part of the regulatory state of the pigment cell lineage (<a href=\"#bib50\">Materna et al., 2013</a>). In the oral NSM, the expression of a new suite of regulatory genes is taking place that belong to the blastocoelar lineage GRN (<a href=\"#bib78\">Solek et al., 2013</a>). Our study showed that in the periphery of the oral/lateral NSM, the appearance of 2\u20133 unspecified cells is evident. These cells will soon get specified, at 28/30 hr, by receiving an inductive FGF signaling at the moment of gastrulation. FGF signal reception together with the double-negative gate caused by the repressive action of factor X on NSMR leads to the transcriptional activation of <i>FoxY</i> and <i>FoxC</i> expression. Positive inputs from <i>FoxY</i> and <i>FoxC</i> genes into downstream effectors promote the recruitment of the myogenic genes and lock down the myoblast regulatory state. Genes such as <i>Scl, Dachs, Pitx2</i>, and <i>Not</i> that belong to different NSM regulatory states are excluded from the myogenic domain leaving only the muscle GRN operating. Finally, spatial repression circuits generate regulatory transitions in the expression of key genes such as <i>FoxY, Nanos, SoxE</i>, and <i>Six1/2,</i> which now are established only in the other NSM GRNs. The sea urchin myogenic GRN is a nice example of how dynamic developmental processes can be encoded in the genome and shows clearly that understanding in depth the wiring properties of a developmental GRN model can provide a comprehensive view on the relationship between the regulatory architecture and gene expression dynamics."

One of the most striking findings of this study concerns the paradox that genes are constantly re-used in the same context, but are rewired in different networks. Despite the conserved regulatory modules found in the system, the myogenic GRN structure has diverged extensively among animal groups. As a consequence, the level of the functional importance of the homologous transcriptional regulators (e.g., <i>Six1/2</i> in sea urchin and <i>Ceh-34</i> in <i>C. elegans</i> or MyoD in vertebrates and <i>Nautilus</i> in <i>Drosophila</i>) (this study, [<a href=\"#bib63\">Olson and Klein, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Balagopalan et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amin et al., 2009</a>]), as reflected from the position within the GRN, is often diversified. New, lineage-specific genes are recruited (<i>FoxY</i> in sea urchin), and \u2018master regulatory genes\u2019 either have been lost completely (e.g., the absence of <i>Pax3/7</i> ortholog in the sea urchin) or lose their hierarchical position within the network (e.g., <i>Nautilus</i> in <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>MyoD</i> in vertebrates), with the level of complexity to be reflected in the wiring density and in the GRN organization. However, the fact that the same factors are used over and over again in such different animal systems indicates that the modular components are somehow required for keeping their myogenic activity during evolutionary time. It seems that as transcription factor families expanded and functionally diversified during evolution, the ancestral myogenic function may have been preserved in a more distant family member, rather than the homologous gene, providing the system with several regulatory alternatives, and explaining the high degree of evolutionary plasticity of developmental GRN architecture (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andrikou and Arnone, 2015</a>)."

Some data points were supplemented with results from quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses. qPCR was conducted as described (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rast et al., 2000</a>), using the ViiA 7 REAL TIME PCR detection system and SYBR green chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The primer sequences used are included in <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. ddCt values were calculated between experiment and control embryos and converted to fold differences to be comparable to the NanoString data. Fold changes were calculated using <i>poly-ubiquitin</i> as a reference, and a threshold of twofold difference was chosen as a significant change (<a href=\"#bib48\">Materna and Oliveri, 2008</a>).

We recognise that it represents a large amount of work and appreciate the new insights that it provides into the GRN underlying entry into myogeneis in the sea urchin model. However, the results are over-interpreted and parts of the data are not sufficiently validated for inclusion in the GRN, which requires at least one repeat experiment and preferably by an independent test. This is particularly the case for Hh and SFRP/Wnt signaling as well as Pitx2 and other factors. The FGF data are also unsatisfactory since it is not clear which Ets factor mediates the signal. It is also not clear why, based on the authors criteria for inclusion, some genes are excluded. Why for example is FoxC included and FoxF excluded. A detailed list of data points to be re-examined is given at the end of this letter."

We recognise that it represents a large amount of work and appreciate the new insights that it provides into the GRN underlying entry into myogeneis in the sea urchin model. However, the results are over-interpreted and parts of the data are not sufficiently validated for inclusion in the GRN, which requires at least one repeat experiment and preferably by an independent test. This is particularly the case for Hh and SFRP/Wnt signaling as well as Pitx2 and other factors. The FGF data are also unsatisfactory since it is not clear which Ets factor mediates the signal. It is also not clear why, based on the authors criteria for inclusion, some genes are excluded. Why for example is FoxC included and FoxF excluded. A detailed list of data points to be re-examined is given at the end of this letter</i>."
