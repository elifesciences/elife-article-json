Unexpectedly, Marfan mice treated with CCBs show accelerated aneurysm expansion, rupture, and premature lethality. This effect is both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) dependent and angiotensin-II type 1 receptor (AT1R) dependent. We have identified protein kinase C beta (PKC\u03b2) as a critical mediator of this pathway and demonstrate that the PKC\u03b2 inhibitor enzastaurin, and the clinically available anti-hypertensive agent hydralazine, both normalize aortic growth in Marfan mice, in association with reduced PKC\u03b2 and ERK1/2 activation. Furthermore, patients with Marfan syndrome and other forms of inherited thoracic aortic aneurysm taking CCBs display increased risk of aortic dissection and need for aortic surgery, compared to patients on other antihypertensive agents."

Unexpectedly, Marfan mice treated with CCBs show accelerated aneurysm expansion, rupture, and premature lethality. This effect is both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) dependent and angiotensin-II type 1 receptor (AT1R) dependent. We have identified protein kinase C beta (PKC\u03b2) as a critical mediator of this pathway and demonstrate that the PKC\u03b2 inhibitor enzastaurin, and the clinically available anti-hypertensive agent hydralazine, both normalize aortic growth in Marfan mice, in association with reduced PKC\u03b2 and ERK1/2 activation. Furthermore, patients with Marfan syndrome and other forms of inherited thoracic aortic aneurysm taking CCBs display increased risk of aortic dissection and need for aortic surgery, compared to patients on other antihypertensive agents."

The experiments show that the aortas of these mice grew more quickly and were more likely to tear when compared to mice that did not receive these drugs. Many of these aortic tears were fatal. The calcium channel blockers increased the activity of two signaling molecules that are regulated by TGF\u03b2 signaling. Treating the Marfan mice with other drugs that lower the activity of these signaling molecules protected the aorta, even if they were also treated with the calcium channel blockers."

Together, these findings suggest that it may be dangerous to treat patients with Marfan syndrome with calcium channel blockers. Additional work will be needed to confirm this risk, to find out if it extends to other similar conditions, and to explore the therapeutic potential of drugs that target the two enzymes."

A major cause of mortality in Marfan patients is aortic dissection and rupture. In Marfan mice, multiple phenotypic manifestations, including aortic aneurysm, developmental lung emphysema, mitral valve disease, and skeletal muscle myopathy, correlate with enhanced transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) signaling, while treatment with either TGF\u03b2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) or the angiotensin-II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker (ARB) losartan can ameliorate these phenotypes, in association with evidence of reduced TGF\u03b2 signaling (<a href=\"#bib20\">Neptune et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ng et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Habashi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Cohn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cook et al., 2015</a>).

There are several sub-classes of CCB based on chemical structure, including dihydropyridines (e.g., amlodipine) and non-dihydropyridines, which include both phenylalkylamines (e.g., verapamil) and benzothiazepines (e.g., diltiazem). CCBs are currently considered an alternative therapeutic strategy for Marfan patients intolerant of \u03b2-blockers, due to their ability to reduce contractility of the heart (negative ionotropy) and to lower blood pressure (<a href=\"#bib17\">Milewicz et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">von Kodolitsch and Robinson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hartog et al., 2012</a>). In doing so, they theoretically reduce stress on the aortic wall during cardiac systole. However, there is limited empirical evidence for their safety or utility in patients with Marfan syndrome and other forms of inherited thoracic aortic aneurysm (<a href=\"#bib36\">Williams et al., 2008</a>). To address this, we assessed the effect of two major classes of CCB in a mouse line heterozygous for a cysteine substitution in an epidermal growth factor-like domain in fibrillin-1 (<i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1039G/+</sup>), representative of the most common class of mutations causing Marfan syndrome. This mouse model has been shown previously to closely recapitulate many of the phenotypic manifestations seen in patients with the disorder, including aortic aneurysm (<a href=\"#bib10\">Habashi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Holm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cook et al., 2015</a>)."

They were treated with a dose of amlodipine (12 mg/kg/day) that resulted in a similar reduction in blood pressure as is obtained using losartan in our Marfan mouse model (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1S1</a>). They underwent unsedated in vivo echocardiography at baseline prior to treatment and then every month thereafter. Between 2 and 4 months of age, placebo-treated Marfan mice showed greater aortic root growth than WT littermates, which was unexpectedly exacerbated by amlodipine. This exacerbation was seen in both WT and Marfan mice but was of greater magnitude in the Marfan animals, indicating a specific interaction between the drug and the genotype of the mice (genotype effect: p &lt; 0.0001, amlodipine effect: p &lt; 0.001, interaction effect: p &lt; 0.01, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Amlodipine-treated WT and Marfan mice also showed striking dilatation of the ascending aorta, an aortic segment just distal to the aortic root, which is less commonly affected in people and mice with Marfan syndrome. Amlodipine-induced growth in the ascending aorta was several fold greater than that seen in the aortic root, with Marfan mice again appearing particularly susceptible (genotype effect: p &lt; 0.0001, amlodipine effect: p &lt; 0.0001, interaction effect: p &lt; 0.0001, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Furthermore, while no WT or placebo-treated Marfan mice died during the 3-month drug trial, more than 40% of amlodipine-treated Marfan mice died secondary to aortic rupture, as evidenced by hemothorax or hemopericardium (p &lt; 0.01, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Histologic analyses revealed greater ascending aortic wall thickening, elastic fiber fragmentation, reduced elastin content, and increased collagen deposition in Marfan animals compared to WT littermates, all of which were exacerbated by amlodipine treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Aortic architecture was graded quantitatively on a scale of 0\u20135, by 4 observers blinded to both genotype and treatment arm, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib14\">Holm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cook et al., 2015</a>).

We utilized a dose of 12 mg/kg/day in order to obtain a similar reduction in blood pressure as is achieved using losartan in our Marfan mouse model, as we wished to eliminate blood pressure as a confounding variable when comparing the differential physiological and biochemical effects of the two agents. To ensure that the deleterious effect we observed was not simply due to toxicity of the drug, we repeated the trial using a dose of 3 mg/kg/day. Even at this lower dose, amlodipine still exacerbated both aortic root and ascending aortic growth in WT mice and Marfan littermates, with greater accentuation again occurring in the ascending aorta and in Marfan animals (aortic root interaction effect: p &lt; 0.01, ascending aorta interaction effect: p &lt; 0.01, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1S5</a>)."

Strong trends were maintained after correction for either systolic blood pressure (OR 12.7, p = 0.06) or aortic root size (OR 11.2, p = 0.08) at enrollment. A more profound detrimental effect of CCBs on aortic dissection could be masked by the practice of performing prophylactic aortic surgery when the aorta reaches a dimension that confers risk for dissection. This is generally considered correct clinical management, since the rate of morbidity and mortality with aortic dissection is higher when surgery is performed on an emergent rather than an elective basis. In such a scenario, one might see an increased rate in the need for aortic surgery in the absence of an increased rate of aortic dissection. In keeping with this hypothesis, we found that CCB-treated Marfan patients had an increased odds of needing aortic surgery (OR 5.5, p &lt; 0.001) when compared to patients on other antihypertensive agents, which remained significant when corrected for either blood pressure (OR 5.4, p &lt; 0.001) or aortic size (OR 5.0, p &lt; 0.01) at enrollment."

This interpretation is directly at odds with our mouse model data, where disease acceleration occurred due to the presence of a deleterious factor (i.e., CCB therapy), not simply due to the absence of a protective agent (i.e., \u03b2-blockade). If the latter were the case, then one would expect CCB-treated Marfan mice to have shown the same growth rate as placebo-treated Marfan animals, which was not the case. To further assess this, we controlled for \u03b2-blocker use in our GenTAC analysis (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and found that it did not fundamentally alter the conclusions of the study. The odds of aortic dissection and aortic surgery remained significantly increased in Marfan patients on CCBs (OR 15.9, p = 0.045; OR 5.7, p &lt; 0.01; respectively), while the odds of aortic surgery remained significantly increased in other iTAA syndrome patients on CCBs (OR 2.0, p = 0.026)."

Prior studies in mouse models of Marfan syndrome and related disorders have shown that \u03b2-blockers (e.g., propranolol) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Habashi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Gallo et al., 2014</a>) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi, e.g., enalapril) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Habashi et al., 2011</a>) achieve a relatively modest inhibition of aortic aneurysm growth and fail to preserve aortic wall architecture when compared to the ARB losartan, despite an equivalent reduction in blood pressure. Notably, in Marfan mice the extent of relative protection of these agents correlates closely with suppression of TGF\u03b2-dependent canonical (Smad2/3) or noncanonical (ERK1/2) signaling (<a href=\"#bib14\">Holm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cook et al., 2015</a>).

This is despite the fact that amlodipine lowered blood pressure equally as much as losartan, an effect which should provide some degree of protection against aneurysm progression. This deleterious effect on aneurysm growth was not limited to the dihydropyridine amlodipine, but also extended to another class of CCB, namely the phenylalkylamine verapamil. Given that a significant number of patients with Marfan syndrome and related conditions are prescribed CCBs, a previously unidentified deleterious role for these drugs has important clinical ramifications."

In terms of absolute growth, amlodipine had a significantly greater effect than verapamil, even at its lower dose. While the two drugs both target L-type calcium channels on the cell membrane, verapamil is generally considered to have greater selectivity for cardiac tissue, while amlodipine is considered to have stronger tropism for aortic VSMCs. It may be for this reason that amlodipine has a relatively greater detrimental effect on the aorta compared to verapamil."

The molecular basis of regional predisposition for aortic aneurysm is not yet fully understood but may relate to the distinct developmental origins of the two aortic segments. While vascular smooth muscle cells in the aortic root primarily derive from the second heart field (SHF), those in the more distal ascending aorta derive from the cardiac neural crest (CNC). Prior work has shown that L-type calcium channel function is critical for correct CNC migration, differentiation, and morphogenic patterning, as well as maintenance of an appropriate post-developmental differentiated state (<a href=\"#bib18\">Moran, 1991</a>). Furthermore, mutations in L-type calcium channels result in cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia in neural-crest-derived tissues (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ramachandran et al., 2013</a>). This may explain why CCBs appear to have a greater deleterious effect on the ascending aorta compared to the aortic root."

Retrospective analyses of large data sets are a more realistic solution in such scenarios. An inherent limitation to any analysis of rare Mendelian disorders is the number of patients available. This is even more challenging when stratifying patients based on drugs that have been prescribed. The GenTAC consortium was established to try to overcome some of these challenges. However, it needs to be recognized that the human data contained herein is still limited by relatively small sample size (more so for aortic dissection than aortic surgery) and an inability to control for the dose or number of medications that patients were receiving. We were able to control for aortic size at the time of enrollment, which is an indicator of baseline aortic disease severity and a predictor of future risk of aortic dissection and/or need for aortic surgery. We were also able to control for blood pressure, which is a known risk factor for aneurysm progression. Hence while the conclusions that can be drawn are not definitive, the data suggest that CCBs should be used with caution in Marfan patients. They also suggest that CCBs may be deleterious in other Marfan-related conditions, although a larger sample size will be needed to assess risk after stratification by individual disorders."

Each site obtained approval to conduct the study from their respective institutional review boards, and informed consent was obtained at each site. Longitudinal observational data were collected on adults and children diagnosed with one of 12 thoracic aortic aneurysm-related conditions, primarily including Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, Ehlers-Danlos and Turner syndromes, BAV, and familial thoracic aortic aneurysm. Designated registry investigators at each enrolling site confirmed diagnostic classifications of genetically associated aortic conditions. Demographic indices were abstracted from medical records at the time of registry enrollment by site-specific research coordinators, and all samples were de-identified to preserve patient confidentiality."

Aortic dissection or surgery was assessed prospectively in the follow-up period after enrollment. Mean follow-up was 50.8 \u00b1 1.6 months for the Marfan patients and 43.4 \u00b1 0.8 months for all TAA syndrome patients. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, United States). Exact ORs and two-sided p-values were calculated using PROC LOGISTIC. Models were adjusted for potential cofounders identified a priori (i.e., systolic blood pressure measurement and aortic root size measurement at the time of enrollment). Interaction terms were determined not to be statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05), so only main effects were included in the final models."

The exacerbated phenotype was rescued by administration of PKC inhibitor or hydralazine, which was proposed to inhibit PKC-dependent ERK phosphorylation. Lastly, the authors used GenTAC consortium database to show that patients on CCB had a stronger trend of aortic dissection even after correction for systolic blood pressure or aortic size. The information obtained from this study is critical for consideration of drug regimen for Marfan patients. It also provides an opportunity for hydralazine protocol.

The aortic root is developmentally distinct from the ascending aorta. While vascular smooth muscles cells (VSMCs) in the aortic root primarily derive from the second heart field (SHF), those in the more distal ascending aorta derive from the cardiac neural crest (CNC). Prior work has shown that neural crest cells express L-type calcium channels during migration and differentiation, while blockage of these channels by CCBs, both in vivo and in vitro, leads to a dramatic and reversible inhibition of neural crest migration (<a href=\"#bib18\">Moran, 1991</a>). Furthermore, CCB treatment of whole embryos, even after neural crest cells have already migrated and differentiated, still causes a significant change in individual cell shape and morphogenic patterning, suggesting that maintenance of a differentiated state in neural crest cells may be regulated at least in part by -L-type calcium channels. Other work has shown that mutations in L-type calcium channels result in cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia in neural- crest derived tissues (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ramachandran et al., 2013</a>). Our current hypothesis is that SHF- and CNC-derived VSMCs show variable responses to the underlying disease process and to CCB treatment in this context. We are currently attempting to test this hypothesis, but are hampered by the lack of adult markers of VSMC lineage \u2013 necessitating a complex breeding strategy that introduces lineage-specific marker alleles. Increased vessel wall collagen is a common finding in inherited aneurysm conditions that have been linked to TGF\u03b2. Our current belief is that collagen deposition is a marker of other pathogenic events, but does not contribute to disease progression. Given our rudimentary understanding of these issues, any proposed mechanistic connection to the pathogenesis of gingival hyperplasia in CCB-treated patients would be overly speculative at this time, but worthy of future study."

This differs from the <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1039G/+</sup> mouse model we used, which is heterozygous for the most common class of missense mutation causing Marfan syndrome in people. While this may have some relevance, it is perhaps more important that the Cook paper did not address the phenotypic consequences of angiotensinogen gene knockout in the aorta \u2013 the sole focus of this manuscript. It is also notable that the critical figure in their paper that assesses the phenotypic consequence of deletion of the angiotensinogen gene (<i>Agt</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> ; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) does not provide data for contemporaneous untreated Marfan mice \u2013 an essential control, but rather the angiotensinogen knockout Marfan mice are only compared to WT animals. Furthermore, no heart weight to body weight data or signaling effects are provided for the <i>Agt</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> animals. The only conclusion that can be reached from this aspect of the study is that Marfan mice lacking angiotensinogen have some degree of left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction, when compared to WT mice. This falls far short of suggesting that all cardiovascular aspects of Marfan syndrome relate to an AT1R-dependent but AngII-independent mechanism."

This suggests that the protective effect of AT1R blockade in Marfan syndrome is, at least in part, dependent on AT2R signaling. Given that AngII is the major ligand for the AT2R, this suggests that AngII signaling (via the AT2R) plays a significant role in driving aortic disease pathology in Marfan mice. Given that ARBs work predominantly (if not exclusively) as a competitive inhibitor of AT1R, these data suggest that the therapeutic effect of ARBs in the aorta relates to displacement of AngII and shunting of signaling through AT2R. It seems notable that no mechanism beyond a vague reference to stretch and integrin signaling was offered by the Cook paper to explain ligand-independent AT1R activation in the heart. While we have not eliminated the angiotensinogen gene, this would seem a reasonable avenue for future work, but falls outside the scope of the current work focusing on the effect of calcium channel blockers in the aortic wall of Marfan syndrome mice."

Hence the half-life of amlodipine in rodents has been shown to be is one-third to one-tenth as long as humans (Stopher et al., 1988), necessitating the use of a significantly higher dose of the drug in rodent studies. Prior work in mouse models of cardiovascular disease have used doses of amlodipine ranging from 1-10mg/kg/day, with the greatest therapeutic effect being seen at the highest dose (Wang et al., 1997). We therefore chose to use a dose that maximized our chance of seeing a therapeutic effect from amlodipine, while simultaneously reducing blood pressure equally as much as losartan in our mouse model. Hence we chose to use a dose of 12mg/kg/day. As one can see from <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, both losartan and amlodipine showed approximately a 25% reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Even the lower dose of amlodipine had a greater effect than verapamil, suggesting that amlodipine has a more deleterious effect than verapamil. While the 2 drugs target L-type calcium channels, verapamil is generally considered to be more cardioselective, with amlodipine having a greater tropism for aortic cells, which may explain why amlodipine has a more deleterious effect than verapamil on aortic growth."

Abnormal or insufficient fibrillin-1 in Marfan syndrome leads to aberrant activation of TGF\u03b2, which in turn leads to upregulation of both canonical (Smad) and non-canonical (ERK) TGF\u03b2-dependent signaling cascades. AngII, via the AT1R, can accentuate this by upregulating TGF\u03b2 signaling, through increased expression of TGF\u03b2 ligands, receptors, and activators (Wolf, Ziyadeh and Stahl, 1999; Fukuda et al., 2000; Naito et al., 2004). The current model illustrates the cross-talk that is believed to occur between the angiotensin and TGF\u03b2 signaling cascades and that is critical to driving aortic disease pathogenesis in Marfan mice. This model highlights why treatment with either TGF\u03b2 neutralizing antibody or the AT1R blocker losartan can lead to therapeutic rescue in Marfan mice. Hence the current model does not contradict our prior work, but rather complements it, by identifying the mechanism of CCB-induced aortic aneurysm exacerbation, and further defining the downstream pathways that drive aortic disease pathogenesis in Marfan mice. It is known that infusion of supraphysiological levels exogenous AngII can induce aneurysm formation and progression in mice (the so-called AngII infusion aneurysm model). Hence the diagram accommodates the fact that this can occur."
