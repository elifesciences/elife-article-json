However, understanding patterning in natural communities is hampered by the multitude of cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013environment interactions as well as environmental variability. Here, through simulations and experiments on communities in defined environments, we examined how ecological interactions between two distinct partners impacted community patterning. We found that in strong cooperation with spatially localized large fitness benefits to both partners, a unique pattern is generated: partners spatially intermixed by appearing successively on top of each other, insensitive to initial conditions and interaction dynamics. Intermixing was experimentally observed in two obligatory cooperative systems: an engineered yeast community cooperating through metabolite-exchanges and a methane-producing community cooperating through redox-coupling. Even in simulated communities consisting of several species, most of the strongly-cooperating pairs appeared intermixed. Thus, when ecological interactions are the major patterning force, strong cooperation leads to partner intermixing."

Similarly, by predicting the sorts of patterns that will form when the fitness effects of ecological interactions between cells are the only forces at work, Momeni et al. lay the groundwork for investigations into other mechanisms, such as cell\u2013environment interactions and active cell motility, that can govern pattern formation in microbial communities."

Patterning, reflecting the relative spatial positioning of individuals with respect to each other, can be critical for the proper functioning of a community. Consider microbial communities: in a synthetic community, three bacterial species, each contributing an essential benefit while simultaneously competing for these benefits, can only grow when they are separated by an intermediate distance (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kim et al., 2008</a>); different types of patterning are correlated with different levels of biofilm growth (<a href=\"#bib6\">Christensen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brenner and Arnold, 2011</a>); branching colony morphology allows more effective spreading across a nutrient-poor surface (<a href=\"#bib28\">Levine and Ben-Jacob, 2004</a>); and in waste treatment granules, the layered pattern of bacteria and archaea is thought to facilitate the sequential degradation of substrates (<a href=\"#bib40\">Satoh et al., 2007</a>)."

Understanding the mechanistic basis of pattern formation from observations of natural communities is stymied by the multitude of cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013environment interactions, as well as environmental variations within and across communities.

When the group of cells reached approximately 5-cell radius (c, hour 14), cells in the center could no longer push other cells to the side and instead budded upward, as indicated by higher intensities in the fluorescence images. Continued growth of microcolony forced more cells in the middle to send their progeny to upper layers, while cells close to the edge could still push other cells to the side and remained on the agarose surface (d, hour 17.5).

(<b>B</b>) In simulations of the diffusion and fitness models, a focal budding cell (star) was assumed to bud toward the nearest empty space within its coplanar (x,y) confinement neighborhood of n-cell radius (left panel, magenta circle). If the nearest empty space was not unique, a random choice was made. Cells along the path (yellow rim) to the nearest empty space shifted positions (left panel, cyan arrows) to accommodate the new cell. During rearrangement, if a cell moved to a new position with no cells immediately below it, the cell was lowered until it landed on another cell or the agarose surface. If the confinement neighborhood was filled, the cell budded upward and pushed up all cells above it (right panel)."

Therefore, for simplicity, we use [\u223c \u223c] to denote the \u2018baseline\u2019 competition. The fitness effect of baseline competition can start at zero if shared resources are in excess, but will eventually become negative as shared resources become limited. In \u2018addition\u2019 to competition, interactions between two partners can exert positive, negative, or no fitness effects on one or both partners. The \u2018net\u2019 fitness effects of all interactions between two partners, including competition, on the two partners can be represented as two symbols in a square bracket. There are six possibilities:[\u223c \u223c] (no fitness effects other than those from baseline competition), [\u223c \u2191] (commensalism, in which one partner experiences nothing more than competition whereas the other enjoys an overall fitness benefit even when competition has been taken into consideration), [\u223c \u2193] (amensalism), [\u2193 \u2193] (mutual antagonism), [\u2193 \u2191] (victim-exploiter), and [\u2191 \u2191] (cooperation). The identities of partners may be added to the notation such that A[\u2193 \u2191]B would mean that the overall interaction (including competition) inhibits A and promotes B. Under this notation, inter-population toxin-warfare (<a href=\"#bib46\">Vetsigian et al., 2011</a>) would be [\u2193 \u2193] while inter-population cooperation based on the exchange of distinct net benefits would be [\u2191 \u2191]. Some interactions may at the first sight seem cooperative, but the net interaction may turn out not to be cooperative after considering the negative effects of competition (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kim et al., 2008</a>). In the game theory definition, cooperative acts incur fitness costs to the performers. Here we have taken a more liberal definition of cooperation to include mutually-beneficial interactions that may or may not involve fitness costs."

Specifically, two populations of cells, marked as red and green, were initially randomly distributed on a surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Cells grew horizontally until sufficiently confined, at which point they grew upward to accommodate the birth of new cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Thus, no active cell motility was present during community growth. The growth rate of a focal cell was determined by its basal fitness as a single cell and by its interactions with other cells in a defined interaction neighborhood. To reflect the negative fitness effects of intra- and inter-population competition for shared resources ([\u223c \u223c]), the fitness of the focal cell was decreased as the total population size in the interaction neighborhood increased. In addition, the focal and partner cells affected each other's fitness positively (\u2191), negatively (\u2193), or neutrally (\u223c). The magnitude of fitness effect is quantitative. Thus, to obtain qualitative ecological patterning rules, we focused on strong interactions in which \u2191 and \u2193 exert fitness effects large enough to be comparable to the recipient's basal fitness. In most simulations using the fitness model, the basal fitnesses of both partners were non-zero, and therefore \u2191 represented strong facultative interactions: a participant could survive on its own at its basal fitness but fared much better in the presence of its partner."

Ratio convergence requires \u2018balanced\u2019 fitness. For example, for A[\u223c \u2191]B to achieve ratio convergence, the basal fitness of A must be higher than that of B and after gaining the fitness benefit from commensalism, B must be able to grow at least as fast as A. This way, a situation incompatible to ratio convergence, that is, one partner always fitter than the other, does not occur. Using engineered competitive, obligatory commensal, and obligatory cooperative yeast communities (see below), we confirmed that population ratios converged in the commensal and cooperative but not competitive communities (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This convergence of population ratios reflects a balance between supply and consumption when growth is limited by supply (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shou et al., 2007</a>): if, for instance, the supplier population suddenly increased in relative abundance, then each individual in the consumer population would receive more benefit and grow faster, which would return the ratio to its original value."

When competing strains had different fitnesses (unequal-fitness competition, abbreviated as \u2018Uneq-fitness Comp.\u2019), the fitter population <i>G</i> expanded during growth, as evident in top views (<b>A</b>, right) and vertical cross-sections (<b>D</b>, right). In obligatory commensal communities, since one supplier could support the birth of multiple consumers, consumers eventually overgrew and covered suppliers (top-views in <b>B</b> and vertical cross-sections in <b>E</b>). Obligatory cooperative communities showed substantial population intermixing as suggested by alternating cell types in top-views (<b>C</b>, 6\u00d7 magnification insets in experiments) and patchy cross-section patterns (<b>F</b>). Top views of communities from the diffusion model integrate intensity and color over height such that brighter colors represent higher cell numbers and yellowness indicates the simultaneous presence of green and red. Scale bar: 100 \u03bcm. All communities started from total 500 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> and <i>R</i>:<i>G</i> = 1:1. (<b>G</b>) Quantification of intermixing in experimental (symbols) and diffusion-model (lines) communities showed that while the intermixing index remained low for commensal (brown) and competitive (grey and black) communities, it increased linearly with community height in obligatory cooperative (magenta) communities. Results from the diffusion model underestimated intermixing indexes because a confined cell was modeled to divide strictly vertically upward (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) without allowing cell movements in horizontal directions (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). (<b>H</b>) A conceptual model illustrates the development of intermixing over time in a strongly cooperative community with 1:1 steady-state population ratio. Local deviations from the steady-state ratio result from asymmetric partner properties and/or stochastic fluctuations in cell numbers (i). The under-abundant population (red) grows faster than its neighboring over-abundant partner (green). Due to the spatial localization of large cooperative benefits, cells near population borders grow faster than those farther away. Consequently, cells from the initially under-abundant red population at the border divide the fastest. Progeny that pile on the green partner have more access to cooperative benefits than those who do not (ii), which favors intermixing. When the previously over-abundant partner becomes under-abundant (iii), piling-up in the opposite direction occurs (iv, green on red)."

We found that in both the diffusion model and experiments, equal-fitness competitive communities formed segregated columns (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, left). Unequal-fitness (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, right) and obligatory commensal communities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) displayed a layered pattern in which the top portion of a community was dominated by one partner. In contrast to competitive and obligatory commensal communities, obligatory cooperative communities appeared to show population intermixing with patches of red and green cells emerging on top of each other (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A and B</a>). Cooperative intermixing appeared to be less in the diffusion model than in yeast communities. This is presumably because the diffusion model assumed that a confined cell would bud strictly upward whereas in yeast communities, cell divisions could stray to the side (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>)."

As expected, equal-fitness competition resulted in small intermixing indexes at all community heights (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, grey). In unequal-fitness competition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, black) and obligatory commensalism (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, brown), the formation of a layered pattern caused a small increase in the intermixing index that subsequently leveled off. In contrast, the intermixing index in obligatory cooperative communities increased proportionally to community height in both experiments and the diffusion model (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, magenta). This proportionality suggested the existence of a characteristic patch size (\u2018Spatial analysis\u2019 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), denoted <math id=\"inf48\"><mrow><msubsup><mo>\u03bb</mo><mtext>z</mtext><mo>*</mo></msubsup></mrow></math>, of 10\u201320 \u00b5m. The characteristic patch size was independent of initial conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Indeed, a calculation of the patch size based on experimentally-determined release, diffusion, and consumption of exchanged metabolites yielded comparable results (\u2018Calculating the characteristic patch size in cooperative yeast communities\u2019 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

Using the diffusion model, we found that if cooperative benefits were not spatially localized because of instant distribution of benefits throughout the community or because of excessive supply levels, intermixing was diminished (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Based on this result and based on patterns observed in top-views and vertical cross-sections of cooperative communities, we propose that local deviations from the steady-state ratio coupled with localized large cooperative benefits cause partners to \u2018take turns\u2019 to grow, which leads to population intermixing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). In summary, in communities engaging in strong cooperation, but not in communities governed by other types of ecological interactions, the intermixing index increases proportionally as a function of community height. This proportionality is due to a fixed patch size determined by localized nutrient supply and consumption."

The initial partner ratio did not significantly affect the level of intermixing (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). At very high initial cell densities, we observed significant intermixing in communities directly above the inoculation area even in the absence of cooperation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>, yellow shading). This is because high cell densities put different cell types in close proximity to one another, and cell divisions that were not perfectly straight upward (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>) caused intermixing. However, we reasoned that communities beyond the inoculation area might reveal patterns indicative of the underlying interactions, because these regions are formed by cell growth under the fitness influences of interactions. To test this possibility, we spotted cell mixtures at high densities on agarose and allowed the community to expand to new territories beyond the inoculation area. Even though communities directly above the inoculum always appeared highly intermixed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, \u2018Center\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>), in edge sections, significant intermixing was only observed in cooperative communities (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, \u2018Edge\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>)."

(<b>B</b>) Partner intermixing is insensitive to the kinetics of interactions. With or without incorporating details such as significantly better starvation tolerance in adenine-requiring cells compared to lysine-requiring cells and the consequent delay in lysine release compared to adenine release (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shou et al., 2007</a>), the diffusion model (lines) yielded substantial population intermixing. Diffusion constant within the community was assumed to be 20 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s. In both (<b>A</b>) and (<b>B</b>), communities started from 3000 total cells/mm<sup>2</sup> at 1:1 population ratio. (<b>C</b>) Intermixing does not depend on asymmetry between cooperating partners. We examined symmetric obligatory cooperation by assuming that for the two partners, all live cells released nutrients at a constant and identical rate without delay, and that other properties such as rates of growth, death, and nutrient consumption were also identical. Partner intermixing in this symmetric obligatory cooperative system (Sym. coop) was similar to that in asymmetric obligatory yeast cooperative system (Coop). Simulated communities started from total 500 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> at 1:1 population ratio. (<b>D</b>) Cooperative intermixing is insensitive to initial ratios. Engineered yeast communities were initiated at a total cell density of 3000 cells/cm2 and grown to near the carrying capacity of the agarose column. Box plots show 25th to 75th percentile values of the intermixing index, with the median marked with a line and whiskers extending to 95% confidence interval.

Large intermixing indexes at high initial cell densities were due to the fact that the budding direction of a cell under spatial confinement was not exactly vertical (<b>F</b>). To facilitate comparisons, intermixing indexes in communities with different heights were linearly normalized to correspond to a height of \u223c30 cell layers (150 \u00b5m).

As described above, in the diffusion model, excessive supply amounts or instant distribution of benefits throughout the community diminished intermixing (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The former can occur if the local availability of cooperative benefits is not growth-limiting. However, cooperative benefits are unlikely to be available in large excess because of the potential fitness cost of generating benefits and because of competition for these benefits in the partner population. As far as diffusion is considered, the diffusion model showed significant population intermixing in obligatory cooperative communities with diffusion constants varying more than 10-fold (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Additional calculations showed that intermixing was largely insensitive to diffusion kinetics, because the characteristic patch size was related to the diffusion constant by 1/5 power (\u2018Calculating the characteristic patch size in cooperative yeast communities\u2019 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The diffusion model also showed that intermixing was present with or without a delay in <math id=\"inf49\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>G</mi><mrow><mo>\u2192</mo><mi>L</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2190</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> supplying lysine benefits to the partner (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Furthermore, even though asymmetry between properties of partners (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) would seem to facilitate intermixing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), asymmetry in partner properties was not required to generate intermixed patterns: partners that grew, died, and released and consumed metabolites at identical rates intermixed (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

This result is intuitive: facultative cooperation should resemble obligatory cooperation if fitness benefits are large for both partners. When only one partner receives a large fitness benefit, facultative cooperation should resemble obligatory commensalism. Finally, small fitness benefits for both partners will make facultative cooperation resemble competition. In facultative cooperation with smaller fitness benefits, intermixing would be apparent if communities could grow to greater heights. Further experiments are required to test these predictions. Together, these results suggest that intermixing relies on spatial localization of cooperative benefits that are sufficiently large to both partners, and is otherwise insensitive to initial conditions or the detailed kinetics of interactions."

For example, if A promotes B which inhibits C, it will appear that A inhibits C. This is akin to indirect interactions between gene products in a cell. To test whether intermixing between cooperators was affected by other members of a community, we used the fitness model to simulate communities composed of five interacting species (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

A total of 240 pair-wise interactions in 24 independent communities were examined in the fitness model. In most cases (26 out of 31), cooperative pairs intermixed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D</a>).

These deviations are consistent with the notion that the intermixing index reflects the \u2018overall\u2019 interaction between two partners, integrating any additional fitness effects of indirect interactions through other community members. Thus, strongly cooperating partners intermix while deviations from this expectation reflect the presence of strong indirect interactions."

                                "text": "The first expectation is that interactions conferring large fitness benefits to at least one partner ([\u2191 \u2191], [\u223c \u2191], and [\u2193 \u2191]) can potentially result in ratio convergence (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Ratio convergence confers stability to community composition. The composition of a community is defined to be locally (or globally) stable if after small (or any-size) deviations from it, either due to initial conditions different from it or perturbations, the community eventually returns to this composition. An analytical calculation based on the fitness model showed that in [\u2191 \u2191] and [\u223c \u2191], global stability can be achieved whereas in [\u2193 \u2191], local stability can be achieved (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; \u2018Requirements for steady-state ratios in the six types of communities\u2019 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Experimentally, obligatory cooperation and obligatory commensalism led disparate initial ratios to converge (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, in competition between two populations of equal fitness, population ratio is determined by the initial value until a perturbation resets the value which will remain unchanged until the next perturbation. In competition between two populations of unequal fitness, the fitter population should increase in frequency and therefore, population ratio is unstable. In amensalism and mutual antagonism, population ratios at best have an unstable fixed point (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). This means that even if the population ratio may seem \u2018fixed\u2019, slight deviations will send it farther and farther away from the original fixed value. The reason for this instability, using mutual antagonism as an example, is because if A inhibits B and B inhibits A (A[\u2193 \u2193]B), then an increase in population A will facilitate inhibition of B and therefore make B less able to inhibit A, further increasing the relative abundance of A."

Cooperative intermixing requires spatially localized benefits that are sufficiently large to both partners (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), and otherwise appears to be robust against variations in initial conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) or reaction dynamics (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>).

The intermixing indexes in these communities increased linearly as a function of community height, because these communities exhibited fixed-size patches associated with the spatial localization of benefits (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; \u2018Calculating the characteristic patch size in cooperative yeast communities\u2019 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). This is in stark contrast with other ecological interactions which lead to segregated or layered patterns (<a href=\"#fig1 fig2\">Figures 1 and 2</a>) in which the intermixing index remained low or increased transiently before leveling off. In simulated multi-species communities, strongly cooperative pairs intermixed in most cases; cases where cooperative pairs did not intermix or non-cooperative pairs intermixed were likely caused by strong indirect interactions through other partners. In a theoretical study using a one-dimensional stepping-stone model, strongly cooperating partners also appeared much more mixed than competing partners (<a href=\"#bib60\">Korolev and Nelson, 2011</a>)."

B13(FR1) show spatial segregation as competitors when grown on citrate, but when grown on chlorobiphenyl they engage in metabolic commensalism and exhibit a layered pattern (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nielsen et al., 2000</a>). Similarly, when grown on a non-selective carbon source, <i>Comamonas testosteroni</i> WDL7 outcompeted and covered <i>Variovorax</i> sp.

However, it is conceivable that if at least one population actively moves (<a href=\"#bib17\">Houry et al., 2012</a>) or grows hyphae to penetrate the entire community, two populations might appear intermixed even if they do not cooperate. In biofilms of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, two populations differing only in fluorescent colors (<a href=\"#bib21\">Klausen et al., 2003</a>) showed modest intermixing even though the expectation for equal-fitness competition is a columnar pattern with an intermixing index close to zero (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, left).

Stochastic events such as environmental variability, mutations, or fluctuations in initial conditions can all lead to variable patterns. For instance, if the straight-columnar pattern expected for equal-fitness competition is observed for the majority of community but a layered pattern is observed in occasional locations, then fitter mutants may have arisen in these locations, initiating unequal-fitness competition (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hallatschek et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Korolev et al., 2012</a>). For mutually antagonistic interactions, the fitness model showed that population ratios can quickly diverge. Thus, which population eventually dominates depends on the initial population ratio (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In this case, stochastic variations in initial conditions can result in dramatically different patterns, giving rise to a phenomenon equivalent to \u2018survival of the first\u2019.

Analogous to how the competitive exclusion principle has created a framework to examine forces that cause species coexistence, our work on ecological patterning will hopefully lay the ground for examining mechanisms that shape patterning in microbial communities.

In this model, a three-dimensional simulation domain consisted of cell grids representing individual cells and nutrient grids representing nutrient concentrations (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Cell actions and nutrient distributions were updated at discrete time steps over the simulation domain.

The studies are based on a previously developed system of two yeast strains that can enter cooperative interactions. The present paper deals with the development of a spatial patterning model in conjunction with a series of experiments that use different starting conditions to infer the stability of the observed patterns. The results of these experiments are then compared with the respective simulation results to validate the theoretical approach. This in turn is taken to infer further, more complex interactions in multi-partner systems. An additional experimental validation comes from the use of two bacterial species that interact on biochemically very different principles."

The main research question addressed is certainly significant, and the authors elegantly investigate it by using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. There are no severe methodological problems that need to be addressed. However, there are some concerns about the generality of the findings. The current version reads in places as if general rules were derived; but, strictly speaking, they are only tested for systems with obligate cooperation. Also, the possibility of antagonistic interactions is not addressed at all. Still, it appears that the paper is a very strong starting point for future work into extended directions. Hence, we will by happy to offer publication in <i>eLife</i>, provided the following points are addressed in a revised version."

We show that if such fitness effects are responsible for community patterns, strong cooperation is the only type of interaction that leads to population intermixing. To make an analogy, species coexistence is not considered a limitation of the competitive exclusion principle. There are other forces that make species not compete for exactly the same resources, and the competitive exclusion principle provides a framework of expectations that allows us to recognize and study those forces. We do agree that the original discussions on forces that cause deviations from the ecological patterning expectations could benefit from being more explicit and organized. Thus, we have expanded and reorganized discussion into three subsections."

However, we realized that if we supplement adenine and lysine to the agarose, the cells would simply exhaust the supplements first (competition) and then the interaction would switch to obligatory cooperation in addition to competition for other shared resources. One could argue that a steady supply of a very low concentration of adenine and lysine would create a facultative cooperative system, but there is no easy way of evenly supplying all cells in the community. In addition, any flow system would also wash out some of the released metabolites. To create <i>bona fide</i> facultative cooperation, we would need to either screen for natural microbes for facultative cooperation or create reduction-of-function (rather than loss-of-function) alleles in enzymes mediating adenine and lysine biosynthesis, and ideally these mutations should also be non-revertible. This would call for two genetic screens for appropriate mutations, which is beyond the scope of our study. Our fitness model predicts that in facultative cooperation, if for both partners the fitness benefits are large compared to the basal fitness, intermixing will increase rapidly as a function of community height."
