                    "text": "Whereas it is well established that chronic stress induces female reproductive dysfunction, whether stress negatively impacts fertility and fecundity when applied <i>prior</i> to mating and pregnancy has not been explored. In this study, we show that stress that concludes 4 days prior to mating results in persistent and marked reproductive dysfunction, with fewer successful copulation events, fewer pregnancies in those that successfully mated, and increased embryo resorption. Chronic stress exposure led to elevated expression of the hypothalamic inhibitory peptide, RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP3), in regularly cycling females. Remarkably, genetic silencing of RFRP3 during stress using an inducible-targeted shRNA completely alleviates stress-induced infertility in female rats, resulting in mating and pregnancy success rates indistinguishable from non-stress controls. We show that chronic stress has long-term effects on pregnancy success, even post-stressor, that are mediated by RFRP3. This points to RFRP3 as a potential clinically relevant single target for stress-induced infertility."

In this study, we show that stress that concludes 4 days prior to mating results in persistent and marked reproductive dysfunction, with fewer successful copulation events, fewer pregnancies in those that successfully mated, and increased embryo resorption. Chronic stress exposure led to elevated expression of the hypothalamic inhibitory peptide, RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP3), in regularly cycling females. Remarkably, genetic silencing of RFRP3 during stress using an inducible-targeted shRNA completely alleviates stress-induced infertility in female rats, resulting in mating and pregnancy success rates indistinguishable from non-stress controls. We show that chronic stress has long-term effects on pregnancy success, even post-stressor, that are mediated by RFRP3. This points to RFRP3 as a potential clinically relevant single target for stress-induced infertility."

The researchers exposed female rats to stress by restricting their movements for 3 hr each day over the course of 18 days, which increased the levels of stress hormones in the animals. They allowed the rats to recover for one full reproductive cycle\u2014equivalent to a month in humans\u2014and found that while their stress hormone levels returned to normal, RFRP3 levels in the brain remained high. Even after the recovery period, the females were less likely to mate. Also, the females that did mate were less likely to become pregnant, and the ones that did were more likely to lose some of the embryos. Overall, the level of reproductive success in these rats was only 21%, down from 76% in the control group (who were not exposed to the stress)."

From an evolutionary perspective, inhibition of reproductive function by acute stress may be adaptive, delaying reproduction in times of duress or resource scarcity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wasser and Barash, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Louis et al., 2011</a>). Chronic stress, however can result in persistent, maladaptive sexual dysfunction and suppressed fertility (<a href=\"#bib37\">Young et al., 2006</a>). Little is understood about the lasting effects of stress exposure. For example, after its cessation, can a prior, persistent stressor have long-term negative after-effects on reproductive health? In humans, a high-stress environment may be a significant barrier to sexual well-being and childbearing. In healthy couples under 30 years of age, 63\u201380% are unable to conceive within 3 months of attempting, and within 1 year of attempting pregnancy, 15% of couples remain unable to conceive (<a href=\"#bib20\">Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in collaboration with the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, 2008</a>). A molecular framework to understand the long-term effects of stress on female reproduction, and its implications for human health, is currently lacking."

                        "text": "The present series of studies sought to answer two main questions: 1) Do stressful events negatively impact female reproductive function even following recovery of the stressor, and, if so, 2) are the deficits observed mediated by stress-induced elevation of the inhibitory neuropeptide, RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP3)? To our knowledge, no study to date has elucidated the molecular mechanisms of stress-induced infertility nor has there been any investigation of long-lasting after-effects of pre-conception stress on reproductive success and pregnancy outcome. RFRP3, the mammalian ortholog of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) first identified in Japanese quail (<a href=\"#bib28a\">Tsutsui et al., 2000</a>), is common across mammals, including rats and mice (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ukena and Tsutsui, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ukena et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Kriegsfeld et al., 2006</a>), hamsters (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ubuka et al., 2012</a>), non-human primates (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ubuka et al., 2009a</a>), and humans (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ubuka et al., 2009b</a>), and is a hypothalamic hormone that directly inhibits the firing of kisspeptin-sensitive gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in the hypothalamus in mice (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ducret et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wu et al., 2009</a>). It also reduces downstream luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in rats (<a href=\"#bib10\">Johnson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Murakami et al., 2008</a>), mice (<a href=\"#bib27\">Son et al., 2012</a>), and hamsters (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kriegsfeld et al., 2006</a>). There is some debate as to whether RFRP3 is a hypophysiotropic hormone (<a href=\"#bib16\">Murakami et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Kirby et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Pineda et al., 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2010b</a>) or only centrally inhibits GnRH to elicit a response (<a href=\"#bib22\">Rizwan et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2012</a>). Regardless of its mechanism of action, RFRP3 decreases the synthesis and release of pituitary gonadotropins, LH, and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), in many species, including rats and mice (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ciccone et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Johnson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Murakami et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Sari et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Kriegsfeld et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ubuka et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Son et al., 2012</a>). In females, RFRP was shown to be regulated throughout the ovulatory cycle in rats and hamsters, and it elicits a marked inhibitory effect on the pre-ovulatory LH surge through inhibition of GnRH activation in rats (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2009</a>). In male rats, RFRP3 expression is elevated 24 hr after a chronic stressor, suggesting that RFRP3 may mediate enduring changes in reproductive function (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kirby et al., 2009</a>). Levels of the glucocorticoid stress hormone (in rodents, corticosterone) may mediate this effect; RFRP3 neurons in the rat hypothalamus were shown to express glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kirby et al., 2009</a>), as well as RFRP-expressing neuronal cell line in vitro (<a href=\"#bib14\">Lee Son et al., 2014</a>). Finally, the RFRP promoter region includes two glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), all together supporting the hypothesis that RFRP may be directly regulated by circulating glucocorticoid levels (<a href=\"#bib14\">Lee Son et al., 2014</a>). Together, these findings provide support for the notion that stress-induced increases in RFRP3 might have long-lasting negative impact on female reproductive functioning. Despite knowledge of RFRP's responsiveness to stress and its role in regulating reproductive axis activity, no study to date has established a causal link between RFRP and fertility in any species. We set out to test the potential role of RFRP expression in stress-induced infertility in females."

This elevated level of expression persisted after a full cycle of recovery from stress, indicating that the impact of stress on RFRP3 lasts well beyond removal of the stressor. Stressed females exhibited fewer successful copulation events, fewer pregnancies in those that did successfully mate, and increased frequency of embryo resorption in the achieved pregnancies. These marked effects of stress on fertility were completely blocked by knockdown of RFRP3, even though RFRP3 function was restored following stress cessation. These findings indicate that stress has lingering negative consequences for female reproductive function that are mediated by a transient rise in RFRP3."

Rats exhibit a 4\u20135 days long estrous cycle, with rising estrogen concentrations triggering a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) to initiate ovulation, and estrogen and progesterone driving sexual receptivity on the night of proestrus (<a href=\"#bib2\">Blaustein, 2008</a>). Stress acutely inhibits the LH surge (<a href=\"#bib5\">Du Ruisseau et al., 1979</a>) and subsequent sexual receptivity and fertility (<a href=\"#bib26\">Sirinathsinghji et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Sato et al., 1996</a>). However, it is unknown whether reproductive function continues to be negatively impacted even following recovery from stress (defined as exhibiting baseline levels of CORT after 4 days of no stress exposure). Rats were monitored daily by vaginal smear to determine whether estrous cyclicity was affected during application of the stressor and to allow separation of animals into different cycle stages (diestrus, proestrus, and estrus) at the termination of the stressor. Stress did not affect estrous cyclicity, with all animals exhibiting normal vaginal cytology throughout the stressor, and all animals exhibited a normal 4- to 5-day estrous cycle after the cessation of stress. At all estrous cycle stages, RFRP3 mRNA expression in the hypothalamus was significantly elevated both 0 and 4 days after the stressor was terminated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Hypothalamic expression of the RFRP3 receptor, G-protein-coupled receptor-147 (GPR147), was also upregulated after stress during all stages of the cycle, and returned to baseline values after the cessation of stress (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). We did not find significant differences in either GnRH or kisspeptin (KISS1) mRNA expression post-stress in any stage of the cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013J</a>). However, hypothalamic samples were taken from whole hypothalamus, precluding the ability to differentiate between rostral and caudal kisspeptin cell populations, potentially masking subtle differences. Notably, the persistent increases in the expression of both RFRP3 and its receptor specifically in proestrus coincide with the cyclical onset of sexual receptivity, suggesting that RFRP3 provides a mechanistic basis for long-lasting suppression of reproductive behavior after stress."

This lentiviral construct expresses RFRP3 shRNA from a constitutively active CMV promoter, driving both shRNA and blue fluorescent protein (BFP) marker expression. When exposed to doxycycline (DOX, via drinking water) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), the tet-Off element is prevented from driving TRE-initiated transcription and both shRNA and BFP production cease (location and extent of viral infection can be seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Stereotaxic infusion of RFRP3 shRNA lentivirus into the hypothalamus led to an 87% down-regulation of RFRP3 mRNA expression within 7 days relative to a control-scrambled shRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Immunohistological labeling verified that the peptide level in the hypothalamus was similarly knocked down by 85% compared to scrambled control virus, measured 2 weeks following viral injection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, representative images of RFRP labeling with either scramble or RFRP-shRNA virus and pre- and post-DOX administration <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013I</a>). Critically, administration of doxycycline in the drinking water restored RFRP3 mRNA to normal levels within 4 days (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This viral vector system permitted knocking down of RFRP3 expression during chronic stress and restoration of RFRP3 during the later stages of copulation, mating, and birthing, which may rely on RFRP3 function in unknown ways."

Moreover, RFRP3 knockdown during stress did not significantly alter CORT response during stress, indicating an intact hormonal stress response (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Stress exposure led to a profound decrease in total reproductive success in females that received the control virus: only 21% of stressed females became pregnant and carried to live birth, as compared to 76% of non-stressed females with control virus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). 80% of the females that received the RFRP-shRNA virus became pregnant and carried to live birth (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The stress-induced decline in reproductive success resulted from a cumulative decrease in mating success (from 88 and 90% in non-stressed groups to 43% in the stress-scrambled group, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) and pregnancy rates in the females that mated (from 87 and 89% in non-stressed groups to 50% in the stress-scrambled group, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Interestingly, knockdown of RFRP3 expression in the hypothalamus during stress exposure prevented the stress-induced suppression of reproduction, leading to 79% copulation success, 82% pregnancy success, and overall reproductive success to 64%, a rate statistically equivalent to control (non-stress) levels (76%, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

Therefore, we next assessed whether pre-copulation stress exposure affects pregnancy outcome. Stressed females that received control-scrambled shRNA had significantly smaller litter sizes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, 12.77 \u00b1 0.91 vs 7.667 \u00b1 2.60 pups/litter, p &lt; 0.05) with no difference in placental scars (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>, 13.0 \u00b1 0.91 vs10.667 \u00b1 3.93, p &gt; 0.05). Embryo survival was analyzed in the females that were successfully impregnated by determining the ratio of placental scars (indicative of successful implantation) to the number of live pups in the litter. These were first pregnancies for all females, so the number of placental scars is indicative of implantation events during this pregnancy. Embryo survival in stressed females that received scrambled shRNA was 78.8 \u00b1 11.7% of fetuses, compared to 98.1 \u00b1 0.95%, and 97.8 \u00b1 1.5% survival in the control scrambled and control RFRP-shRNA groups, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, p &lt; 0.05). Most remarkably, RFRP3 shRNA administration suppressed stress-induced fetal resorption, showing a 93.4 \u00b1 3.2% fetal survival rate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). These results demonstrate that stress-induced increases in RFRP3 expression has long-term detrimental effects on female reproductive fitness that persist long after the stressor has been removed and CORT levels have returned to baseline. In addition, knocking-down RFRP3 expression during stress eliminated the stress-induced decrease in sexual motivation, decrease in pregnancy success, and subsequent increase in embryo resorption."

In rats, a common index of relative sexual receptivity of a female in the presence of males, is the lordosis quotient (LQ), calculated by the number of times the female adopts a lordosis posture scored 2 or higher, divided by the number of times a male mounts her. All females included in the study exhibited lordosis when introduced to a male (indicating that they were in the correct stage of their cycle). Lordosis intensity did not differ within groups (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) but a significant main effect of stress revealed that lordosis intensity was significantly suppressed by stress (F(1, 61) = 5.15, p = 0.0268). Furthermore, lordosis quotient measures revealed significantly lower ratio in the scrambled stress group compared to the non-stressed groups that received scrambled or RFRP-shRNA (0.30 \u00b1 0.10 vs 0.73 \u00b1 0.07 and 0.68 \u00b1 0.07), indicating that stress exposure decreased the relative sexual receptivity of the females (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), congruent with the stress-induced drop in mating success we found.

In our studies, selective knock-down of hypothalamic RFRP3 during stress exposure preserved all aspects of reproductive function that were otherwise reduced in stress-exposed animals (summary schematic, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The stress-induced spike in RFRP3 initiates a long-lasting suppression of reproduction, well after the removal of the stressor, perhaps via positive feedback that maintains elevated RFRP3 levels or engages downstream suppressive targets. These findings reveal a single molecular target that persistently underlies a range of different reproductive dysfunctions that may provide a novel translational framework for clinical study of human reproductive health."

RFRP projects to multiple brain regions responsible for successful reproduction and mating behavior, including the medial pre-optic area (mPOA) (where it is known to affect GnRH release) as well as the BNST, medial amygdala, anterior hypothalamus, and arcuate nucleus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kriegsfeld et al., 2006</a>). Piekarski et al. found that administering RFRP3 to hamsters reduced sexual motivation (as measured by percent of time spent with castrated vs intact males) and vaginal scent marking without effect on lordosis behavior, similar to our present findings. Additionally, RFRP3 administration altered cellular activation in regions of the brain implicated in female sexual motivation, including the mPOA, medial amygdala, and BNST\u2014all regions that receive RFRP projections. These effects were independent of gonadal steroids and kisspeptin cellular activation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Piekarski et al., 2013</a>). While we were unable to measure progesterone or prolactin in this study, it is possible that RFRP projections to the arcuate nucleus affect dopaminergic signaling required for prolactin release and maintenance of progesterone levels and pregnancy success. Future studies aimed at systematically examining each step in these processes is required to gain a full understanding of the neural circuits underlying the deleterious effects of stress on reproduction."

It is possible that manipulation of RFRP3 signaling in humans may relieve stress-related reproductive dysfunction, including decreased sex drive, impaired fertility, and increased miscarriages. Likewise, if similar mechanisms of stress-induced reproductive suppression are common across species, such strategies may be similarly relevant to species bred in captivity that are susceptible to stress-induced infertility, in particular, endangered species whose preservation depends on captive breeding programs."

To construct the shRNA against RFRP, a 22 nucleotide-mer oligo against RFRP gene was designed using the online program maintained by Dr Ravi Sachidanandam's Lab (<a href=\"http://katahdin.mssm.edu/siRNA/RNAi.cgi?type=shRNA\">http://katahdin.mssm.edu/siRNA/RNAi.cgi?type=shRNA</a>). The oligo was inserted into the linearized pLenZs-tetOFF-BFP-shRNAmir-HygR vector using KpnI and EcoRI enzymes after adding enzyme arms on both sides of the oligo using PCR. Lentiviral particles were prepared by PEG-2000 purification of transfected Hek-293 cells and concentrated to titers of 10<sup>9</sup>\u201310<sup>10</sup> infectious particles per ml. The control virus was a non-silence vector commercially available from Open Biosystems (Lafayette, CO), with similar GC content and BLASTed to verify non-specificity."

Stress can alter E2 levels and E2 can down-regulate RFRP expression in rodent hypothalamus (Molnar et al, 2011, Endocrinology; Poling et al, 2012, Endocrinology), strongly alters KISS expression (Smith et al., 2005, Endocrinology), and is essential for normal female sexual behavior and hence, successful fertility (Pfaff, 1973, Science; Rissman et al, 1997, Endocrinology). Decreases in circulating serum LH values are frequently reported to demonstrate that HPG axis is impaired by stress treatments (including in the context of RFRP; Kirby et al. 2009, PNAS). Without knowing circulating E2 or LH values, it is difficult to interpret the current experimental paradigm and outcomes. Could reproductive behavioral deficits or reversals reflective of changes in E2 levels? Is the increase in RFRP seen after stress a secondary effect due to stress's down-regulation of E2, which will result in a removal of E2 inhibition on RFRP expression? Is the neuroendocrine reproductive axis functionally active during this chronic stress paradigm (e.g. are estrous cycles normal during or after the 18 days of stress)? Are serum E2 and LH levels reversed in stressed RFRP knockdown rats? Is progesterone altered during pregnancy by the stress paradigm or prior RFRP knockdown?"

Additionally, most of the pituitary genes did not change (except during estrous in a few cases), making the functional significance unclear.

Stress can alter E2 levels and E2 can down-regulate RFRP expression in rodent hypothalamus (Molnar et al, 2011, Endocrinology; Poling et al, 2012, Endocrinology), strongly alters KISS expression (Smith et al., 2005, Endocrinology), and is essential for normal female sexual behavior and hence, successful fertility (Pfaff, 1973, Science; Rissman et al, 1997, Endocrinology). Decreases in circulating serum LH values are frequently reported to demonstrate that HPG axis is impaired by stress treatments (including in the context of RFRP; Kirby et al. 2009, PNAS). Without knowing circulating E2 or LH values, it is difficult to interpret the current experimental paradigm and outcomes. Could reproductive behavioral deficits or reversals reflective of changes in E2 levels? Is the increase in RFRP seen after stress a secondary effect due to stress's down-regulation of E2, which will result in a removal of E2 inhibition on RFRP expression? Is the neuroendocrine reproductive axis functionally active during this chronic stress paradigm (e.g. are estrous cycles normal during or after the 18 days of stress)? Are serum E2 and LH levels reversed in stressed RFRP knockdown rats? Is progesterone altered during pregnancy by the stress paradigm or prior RFRP knockdown?</i>"

This limits our ability to measure reproductive hormones in the present study at other time points, precluding measurements of progesterone in pregnant dams. We were able to analyze levels of LH and E2 from tail bleed samples taken throughout the stressor. The LH blood levels peak in Sprague-dawley females about 3 hours before lights out (5pm) and are low throughout the rest of the cycle.

RFRP projects to multiple brain regions responsible for successful reproduction and mating behavior, including the medial preoptic area (mPOA) (where it is known to affect GnRH release) as well as the BNST, medial amygdala, anterior hypothalamus and arcuate nucleus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kriegsfeld et al., 2006</a>). Piekarski et. al. found that administering RFRP3 to hamsters reduced sexual motivation (as measured by percent of time spent with castrated vs. intact males) and vaginal scent marking without effect on lordosis behavior, similar to our present findings. Additionally, RFRP3 administration altered cellular activation in regions of the brain implicated in female sexual motivation, including the mPOA, medial amygdala, and BNST - all regions that receive RFRP projections. These effects were independent of gonadal steroids and kisspeptin cellular activation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Conaway and Conaway, 1955</a>). While we were unable to measure progesterone or prolactin in this study, it is possible that RFRP projections to the arcuate nucleus affect dopaminergic signaling required for prolactin release and maintenance of progesterone levels and pregnancy success. Future studies aimed at systematically examining each step in these processes is required to gain a full understanding of the neural circuits underlying the deleterious effects of stress on reproduction.\u201d"
