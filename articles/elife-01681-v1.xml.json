Based on molecular dynamics simulations we proposed that toxic intermediates of different amyloid proteins adopt a common, nonstandard secondary structure, called \u03b1-sheet. Here we report the experimental characterization of peptides designed to be complementary to the \u03b1-sheet conformation observed in the simulations. We demonstrate inhibition of aggregation in two different amyloid systems, \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) and transthyretin, by these designed \u03b1-sheet peptides. When immobilized the \u03b1-sheet designs preferentially bind species from solutions enriched in the toxic conformer compared with non-aggregated, nontoxic species or mature fibrils. The designs display characteristic spectroscopic signatures distinguishing them from conventional secondary structures, supporting \u03b1-sheet as a structure involved in the toxic oligomer stage of amyloid formation and paving the way for novel therapeutics and diagnostics."

Based on molecular dynamics simulations we proposed that toxic intermediates of different amyloid proteins adopt a common, nonstandard secondary structure, called \u03b1-sheet. Here we report the experimental characterization of peptides designed to be complementary to the \u03b1-sheet conformation observed in the simulations. We demonstrate inhibition of aggregation in two different amyloid systems, \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) and transthyretin, by these designed \u03b1-sheet peptides. When immobilized the \u03b1-sheet designs preferentially bind species from solutions enriched in the toxic conformer compared with non-aggregated, nontoxic species or mature fibrils. The designs display characteristic spectroscopic signatures distinguishing them from conventional secondary structures, supporting \u03b1-sheet as a structure involved in the toxic oligomer stage of amyloid formation and paving the way for novel therapeutics and diagnostics."

These diseases involve the conversion of a protein from its soluble native state into insoluble amyloid fibrils, or, in the case of peptides, the conversion from a soluble, loosely structured form to fibrils. Given that many different sequences can form amyloid fibrils of similar architecture, there may be some common structural features of the prefibrillar amyloidogenic intermediates. X-ray fiber diffraction indicates that the insoluble, mature amyloid fibrils are composed of cross \u03b2-sheet structure (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jahn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Eisenberg and Jucker, 2012</a>). Therefore, it is widely held that the formation of amyloid fibrils involves a transition to \u03b2-sheet structure in the amyloidogenic intermediate. However, the mechanism of self-assembly at the atomic level remains elusive. Another feature of these diseases is that soluble oligomeric intermediates, not the insoluble well-ordered fibrils, are preferentially responsible for cellular toxicity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bucciantini et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hardy and Selkoe, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tomic et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Xue et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, the soluble oligomeric forms of the prion protein are the most infectious per unit protein (<a href=\"#bib40\">Silveira et al., 2005</a>). As such, fibrils may be protective, at least up to a point, as their breakdown to smaller aggregates yields greater toxicity and infectivity. The discovery of a compound that promotes inclusion formation while reducing toxicity and cellular pathology supports this hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bodner et al., 2006</a>). In a similar vein, <a href=\"#bib30\">Jiang et al. (2013)</a> demonstrated that binding the fibrillar state of A\u03b2 could reduce toxicity presumably by shifting the equilibrium from oligomer to fibril."

In fact, structural similarities between soluble oligomers from a range of unrelated proteins/peptides has been demonstrated by generation of an antibody that recognizes a common backbone structure (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kayed et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tomic et al., 2009</a>). Glabe and co-workers developed an antibody (denoted A11) that is specific for soluble oligomeric intermediates derived from a variety of peptides and proteins, including A\u03b2(1-42), \u03b1-synuclein, islet amyloid polypeptide, polyglutamine, lysozyme, human insulin, and a prion peptide (<a href=\"#bib24\">Glabe and Kayed, 2006</a>). The antibody does not, however, bind the corresponding insoluble fibrils (cross-\u03b2 structure) or the natively folded precursors (various structures). Based on the specificity of the antibody for soluble oligomers with various sequences, it was proposed that the antibody might recognize a unique conformation of the backbone. This antibody inhibits toxicity associated with the intermediates, implying a common mechanism of toxicity and offering hope for a broad-based therapeutic agent."

                        "text": "Some years ago we \u2018discovered\u2019 a novel secondary structure, which we call \u2018<i>\u03b1-sheet</i>\u2019, that is populated during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a range of amyloid proteins (and peptides) with different structures and sequences under amyloidogenic conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Armen et al., 2004a</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2004b</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Steward et al., 2008</a>). The position where the \u03b1-sheet forms along the sequence coincides with the most amyloidogenic regions of the proteins, as determined experimentally (<a href=\"#bib1\">Armen et al., 2004a</a>). Consequently, we proposed that \u03b1-sheet is a common structure involved in the early stages of protein aggregation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Armen et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Daggett, 2006</a>). In the course of characterizing the structure observed by MD, we learned that \u03b1-sheet was first predicted by Pauling and Corey and called \u2018<i>polar pleated sheet</i>\u2019. However, they ruled the structure energetically unfavorable and concluded, correctly, that the \u03b2-sheet structure would be favored in normal proteins (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pauling and Corey, 1951</a>). An \u03b1-sheet is similar to a \u03b2-sheet, but instead of alternating main chain NH and C = O groups along the strands, an \u03b1-sheet has the NH groups aligned on one side and the carbonyls on the other. As such, the \u03b1-sheet has a molecular dipole and a very different hydrogen-bonding pattern across the sheet compared to a \u03b2-sheet. Interestingly, the main chain (\u03a6, \u03a8) dihedral angles of the \u03b1-sheet alternate between the \u03b1<sub>L</sub> and \u03b1<sub>R</sub> conformations (<a href=\"#bib18\">Daggett, 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Although locally helical, the alternating dihedral angles form an extended chain resulting in the carbonyl groups and amide groups aligning in a plane. Such an arrangement creates uniform electrostatic faces to aid in the addition of further strands (<a href=\"#bib3\">Armen et al., 2004b</a>). Once a sheet is formed, a simple peptide plane flip could convert the \u03b1-sheet into a \u03b2-sheet and ultimately a mature fibril (<a href=\"#bib18\">Daggett, 2006</a>). \u03b1-sheet structure has been observed in a peptide crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib20\">Di Blasio et al., 1994</a>), and short stretches of \u03b1-strand are present in various proteins in the Protein Data Bank (<a href=\"#bib18\">Daggett, 2006</a>), although extensive \u03b1-sheet formation has not been observed in native proteins."

Our designs began with a backbone template in an ideal \u03b1-sheet conformation. We then investigated combinations of residues with high propensities to populate desired regions of conformational space using our Structural Library of Intrinsic Residue Propensities (SLIRP), which is part of our Dynameomics project (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beck et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">van der Kamp et al., 2010</a>).

Both are associated with amyloid diseases, systemic in the case of TTR and Alzheimer's Disease in the case of A\u03b2, but they have completely different sequences and structures. A\u03b2 is a largely unstructured peptide fragment in aqueous solution, while TTR is a tetramer composed of immunoglobulin-like \u03b2-sandwich domains. Both systems have well characterized aggregation profiles and aggregate under mild, non-denaturing conditions (<a href=\"#bib37\">Quintas et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Foss et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hopping et al., 2013</a>). Here we focus on five peptide designs (<i>\u03b2, rc, \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13</i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). <i>\u03b2</i> is the designed Trpzip 3 \u03b2\u2212hairpin, but with Trp to Leu substitutions to improve spectroscopic properties (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cochran et al., 2001a</a>,<a href=\"#bib17\">b</a>).

The <i>rc</i> peptide was designed to be an unstructured random coil to provide a negative control; it is a randomly scrambled version of the \u03b2-sheet sequence, <i>\u03b2</i>. The remaining three peptides were designed to adopt \u03b1-sheet structure. <i>\u03b11</i> and <i>\u03b12</i> are linear hairpins containing a sheet of alternating D- and L-amino acids. <i>\u03b11</i> was designed to have high \u03b1-sheet propensity. <i>\u03b12</i> is a derivative of <i>\u03b11</i> with modifications aimed to improve stability and the introduction of a Cys for coupling experiments. <i>\u03b13</i> consists of a sheet of alternating D- and L-amino acids and two turns, creating a cyclic amide backbone. Despite our best efforts we were unable to design a soluble, random coil control based on the \u03b1-sheet peptides, i.e. the same composition and length. Shuffling of the amino acid sequences resulted in insoluble peptides that were unusable in the solution-phase assays, so we opted to use smaller but well-defined controls."

In contrast, the <i>rc</i> and <i>\u03b2</i> controls resulted in little to no inhibition. The neutral pH tetrameric TTR control changed little over time. Moreover, the designs in the absence of TTR did not bind Congo red and were indistinguishable from the buffer-only controls (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Toxicity was apparent around 24 hr, and the results from this time point are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>. Under these conditions, the viability of the treated cells was reduced by approximately 20%, indicating that TTR was aggregating via the toxic pathway. Addition of the controls, <i>rc</i> or <i>\u03b2</i>, to a 24-hr pre-incubated TTR sample had little to no effect on further aggregation, as detected with the Congo red assay. However, when <i>\u03b11</i> and <i>\u03b13</i> were mixed with 24-hr pre-incubated, toxic TTR, they inhibited 81% and 77%, respectively, of the remaining TTR aggregation observed in the absence of inhibitor."

The \u03b2-sheet design, <i>\u03b2</i>, also resulted in 62% inhibition of A\u03b2 fibrillization, which began exerting its effect primarily between 0 and 6 hr. In contrast, <i>\u03b11</i> became inhibitory after aggregation proceeded for approximately 6 hr. The peptide designs alone did not alter the fluorescence of ThT, and, as with Congo red, they were indistinguishable from buffer\u2013only controls over the time course of the assay (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Also note that the \u03b1-sheet designs are effective at lower concentrations and the efficacy increases at lower temperature; for example, a fourfold excess of <i>\u03b11</i> essentially completely abolishes A\u03b2 aggregation at 25\u00b0C (unpublished).

So, to further probe which species our peptide designs are binding to, we immobilized the designs on agarose beads and applied solutions of either fresh or pre-incubated, toxic samples of A\u03b2 and TTR. Immobilization in this manner also allowed us to test the sparingly soluble <i>\u03b12</i> design by limiting self-aggregation. The peptides were immobilized via their lysine residues on aldehyde-functionalized agarose beads. Their ability to bind TTR or A\u03b2 from solutions at various stages of aggregation was investigated using dot blot analysis of the eluents. All three immobilized \u03b1-sheet designs (<i>\u03b11, \u03b1</i>2 and <i>\u03b13</i>) bound significantly more TTR from pre-incubated, toxic oligomer-containing TTR solutions (pre-incubated at low pH for 24 hr) than did the <i>rc</i> and <i>\u03b2</i> controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Note that while <i>\u03b12</i> does not perform as well as the other two designs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), the binding of TTR by <i>\u03b12</i> relative to the <i>\u03b2</i> and <i>rc</i> controls is significant, as shown by the statistical analysis in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The extent of TTR binding by the <i>\u03b2</i> and <i>rc</i> controls is the same as that of the column matrix alone, which does bind some TTR in the absence of immobilized peptide (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). <i>\u03b11</i>, <i>\u03b12</i> and <i>\u03b13</i> also bound pre-aggregated, toxic A\u03b2 preferentially, whereas <i>\u03b2</i> and <i>rc</i> did not (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, and see statistical analysis in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In the case of the <i>\u03b2</i> design, it preferentially bound the fresh, monomeric A\u03b2 solutions (0 hr) over the toxic solutions (6 hr) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), indicating that inhibition was due to interactions with the \u2018native\u2019 form, not the toxic oligomer. \u03b2-hairpins are known inhibitors of A\u03b2 aggregation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yamin et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, \u03b1-sheet, as demonstrated with <i>\u03b11</i>, did not bind native, tetrameric TTR nor fresh, monomeric A\u03b2 but instead preferentially bound species from the toxic, aggregated 6 hr samples (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Moreover, the \u03b1-sheet designs did not bind the fibrillar forms of A\u03b2 or TTR acquired by allowing the aggregation reactions to continue for over 3 weeks, as illustrated with immobilized <i>\u03b11</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

We can, however, make and test predictions based on the unique conformational and electronic environments resulting from this structure. Circular dichroism (CD) signals arise from the differential absorption of left- and right-hand polarized light by chiral molecules. For proteins, the orientation of individual amide bonds is responsible for the resulting CD spectra in the far-UV region. Mirror image structures, formed by replacing whole L-amino acid sequences with D-amino acids, such as gramicidin A, produce mirror-image CD-spectra (<a href=\"#bib33\">Koeppe et al., 1992</a>).

In its FTIR spectrum we observe multiple small absorbance peaks not corresponding to a predominance of any specific structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Our \u03b2-sheet control is a modified version of the Trpzip peptide, which forms a stable \u03b2-hairpin in solution. In agreement with previous structural work (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cochran et al., 2001a</a>), <i>\u03b2</i> exhibits a CD spectrum reflective of \u03b2-structure and random coil, with a minimum near 220 nm and another near 200 nm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The substitution of Leu for Trp removed the strong exciton-coupling between the Trp residues observed in the parent peptide thereby \u2018exposing\u2019 the \u03b2-structure CD signal. The \u03b2-sheet structure was confirmed by FTIR through its strong absorbance at 1632 cm<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The CD spectra for <i>\u03b11, \u03b12</i> and <i>\u03b13</i> are essentially featureless, as expected for the cancellation of \u03b1<sub>L</sub> and \u03b1<sub>R</sub> signals, except for a slight dip around 200 nm consistent with turn formation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). <i>\u03b11</i> and <i>\u03b12</i> exhibited the predicted FTIR \u03b1-sheet bands at 1640 and 1675\u20131680 cm<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These bands were less pronounced in <i>\u03b13.</i> Cyclization of the amide backbone of <i>\u03b13</i> through a non-optimal turn may have caused distortion of the structure, as has been reported in other peptide systems (<a href=\"#bib15\">Clark et al., 2005</a>), and suggests an area for improvement in future designs. Altogether, these results prove that the designed \u03b1-sheet peptides do not form \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-sheet structure, and that the random coil content is not large (compare against the scale of the <i>rc</i> control CD spectrum).

Also at that time we identified a novel target structure, \u03b1-sheet, through MD simulations and proposed that it is the defining feature of the toxic oligomeric species (<a href=\"#bib1\">Armen et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Daggett, 2006</a>). Unfortunately, the precise structure of this toxic intermediate remains elusive, and it has become clear that the oligomers are conformationally heterogeneous (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carulla et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bitan et al., 2005</a>, and references therein). Here we have taken a different approach to probe these soluble oligomeric species through experimental test of our \u03b1-sheet hypothesis through peptides designed to be complementary to the proposed \u03b1-sheet structure in the oligomeric intermediates. Three of these computationally derived designs were synthesized and characterized experimentally, and they do indeed appear to adopt \u03b1-sheet structure (as shown by FTIR, CD and NMR). The two soluble \u03b1-sheet designs (<i>\u03b11</i> and <i>\u03b13</i>) inhibited both TTR and A\u03b2 aggregation in solution. In addition, when immobilized to agarose beads, all three \u03b1-sheet designs bound species from the toxic TTR and A\u03b2 preparations preferentially over the nontoxic fresh samples. In contrast, the <i>\u03b2</i> control formed a \u03b2-hairpin, as supported by CD and FTIR, and it preferentially bound the monomeric form of A\u03b2 and it did not react with TTR. When mature fibrils were applied to the immobilized \u03b1\u2212sheet designs, the fibrils did not bind and appeared to have no affinity for the \u03b1-sheet structure."

These results support our hypothesis that \u03b1-sheet structure is involved in the toxic oligomeric stage of aggregation, and they provide a reference to determine spectroscopic signatures that can now be used to investigate the structural changes amyloid proteins undergo during amyloidosis. In addition, the \u03b1-sheet designs may aid in capture of the elusive toxic oligomeric species for in-depth characterization. Having demonstrated that the \u03b1-sheet structure may constitute a broad-based inhibitor of amyloidosis, our \u03b1-sheet designs introduce a novel class of amyloid inhibitors that target the toxic soluble oligomeric state of different amyloidogenic peptides and proteins."

Intrinsic conformational propensities of all 20 L-amino acids in a GGXGG peptide were determined by extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beck et al., 2008</a>).

Results were expressed as the fraction of simulation time the atoms were within hydrogen bonding distance. C\u03b1 RMSD was used qualitatively to monitor backbone deviation from the ideal hairpin structure in conjunction with the hydrogen bond scoring function to determine promising designs. We took an iterative approach, with the results of the analyses used to modify and refine sequences for further simulation and evaluation.

Peptides were immobilized in a volume of 200 \u03bcl of coupling buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.2) and 2 \u03bcl cyanoborohydride solution (5 M sodium cyanoborohydride in 1 M NaOH) at a concentration of 358 \u03bcM overnight at 4\u00b0C. Any residual active sites were blocked with 400 \u03bcl quenching buffer (1 M tris hydrochloride, pH 7.4) and 4 \u03bcl cyanoborohydride solution for 4 hr at 25\u00b0C. Binding experiments were performed from 200 \u03bcl amyloid solution (5 \u03bcM A\u03b2 or 20 \u03bcM TTR (monomer) diluted to the desired concentration in coupling buffer), which was allowed to bind to the peptide-bound agarose beads for 2 hr at 25\u00b0C. The solution was then collected by centrifugation (flow through, FT). The beads were resuspended in 300 \u03bcl coupling buffer, vortexed to obtain a uniform slurry, and the solution was again collected by centrifugation (wash 1, W1). The wash step was performed an additional five times (W2\u2013W6). One final wash step was performed but after resuspending the resin, the solution was allowed to sit for 5 min before centrifugation (W7). The resin was next resuspended in 100 \u03bcl 2 M guanidine hydrochloride, incubated for 5 min at room temperature, then collected as before. This was performed twice (E1\u2013E2). The resin was washed again with 300 \u03bcl coupling buffer (W8) followed by two elution steps with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (E3\u2013E4). One final wash step was performed with 300 \u03bcl coupling buffer (W9). All collected eluents were analyzed by applying triplicate 1 \u03bcl spots to nitrocellulose, and then performing standard dot blot analysis as described by Kayed et al. (9) with an anti-TTR (sc-13098, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-A\u03b2 (ab39377; Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA) primary antibody diluted 1:1000 in 5% or 10% nonfat milk, respectively."

The slurry was applied to the diamond and dried to a film over a few minutes while following the disappearance of the broad liquid water band at \u223c1636 cm<sup>\u22121</sup> and the appearance of the protein amide I and amide II bands. The spectra were background-subtracted and comprised of 64 accumulations (4 cm<sup>\u22121</sup> resolution; 1 cm/s OPD velocity; strong apodization). Spectra shown here were recorded as soon as successively collected spectra (each recorded over 80 s) stabilized, indicating little further evaporation of liquid water. This approach was taken to eliminate spectral contributions from free liquid water without desiccating the peptide film any more than necessary. Second derivative spectra were calculated using the instrument software and 13 data points."

Many other research groups have observed this phenomenon previously. For example, Anh and co-workers suggested that in their \u03b1-synuclein and A\u03b2 experiments that the decrease in signal may be a result of unbound ThT quenching the binding fluorescence (Ahn et al. 2007). A similar observation was also reported by another group working on A\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yamin et al. 2009</a>). There also appears to be a concentration dependence of this observation (Ahn et al. 2007), which could explain why we see a larger decrease in fluorescence for uninhibited A\u03b2 (rc sample) than we do for our inhibited samples.
