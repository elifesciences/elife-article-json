However, the mechanisms that control signal transmission at this synapse and its relevance to behavior remain poorly understood. In this study we used a genetic system to titrate the rate of GPCR signaling in ON-BC dendrites by varying the concentration of key RGS proteins and measuring the impact on transmission of signal between photoreceptors and ON-BC neurons using electroretinography and single cell recordings. We found that sensitivity, onset timing, and the maximal amplitude of light-evoked responses in rod- and cone-driven ON-BCs are determined by different RGS concentrations. We further show that changes in RGS concentration differentially impact visually guided-behavior mediated by rod and cone ON pathways. These findings illustrate that neuronal circuit properties can be modulated by adjusting parameters of GPCR-based neurotransmission at individual synapses."

However, the mechanisms that control signal transmission at this synapse and its relevance to behavior remain poorly understood. In this study we used a genetic system to titrate the rate of GPCR signaling in ON-BC dendrites by varying the concentration of key RGS proteins and measuring the impact on transmission of signal between photoreceptors and ON-BC neurons using electroretinography and single cell recordings. We found that sensitivity, onset timing, and the maximal amplitude of light-evoked responses in rod- and cone-driven ON-BCs are determined by different RGS concentrations. We further show that changes in RGS concentration differentially impact visually guided-behavior mediated by rod and cone ON pathways. These findings illustrate that neuronal circuit properties can be modulated by adjusting parameters of GPCR-based neurotransmission at individual synapses."

Cells called rods and cones detect the light, and then signal to other neurons in the retina that relay this information to the brain. Rods and cones are specialized to respond best to different visual features: cones detect color and can track rapid movement; whereas rods are more sensitive to low light levels and so enable night vision."

To maintain the differences in how visual features are detected, the signals sent by the rod or cone cells need to be tuned separately. Previous studies showed that bipolar cells rely on the action of proteins called RGSs to control how information is passed from rods and cones to ON bipolar cells.

However, in a task involving fast-moving objects that investigated the response of cone cells, only changes to the speed of the response affected vision. Therefore, the RGS protein has different effects on the signals from rod cells and cone cells. These findings will be useful for understanding how different light sensitive cells in the retina communicate their signals to extract important visual features, allowing us to both see well at night and track rapid changes in scenery on a bright sunny day."

These dissociated G proteins form active species that regulate the activity of second messenger enzymes, and either directly or indirectly modulate the opening of a number of ion channels (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cabrera-Vera et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">McCudden et al., 2005</a>). It is now well recognized that the predominant role in controlling GPCR signaling belongs to the Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins. RGS proteins stimulate GTP hydrolysis thus promoting subunit re-association and resulting in the termination of G protein signaling on a physiological timescale (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ross and Wilkie, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hollinger and Hepler, 2002</a>). Studies with knockout mice indicate that the elimination of RGS impacts key parameters of GPCR-driven signaling including sensitivity, temporal characteristics, and response amplitudes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Heximer et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rahman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Posokhova et al., 2010</a>).

For example, the elimination of the dominant RGS in rod photoreceptors profoundly slows deactivation kinetics while minimally affecting response amplitude or sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Krispel et al., 2006</a>), whereas in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, moderate changes in response kinetics are accompanied by increased sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib55\">Xie et al., 2010</a>). Altogether, these findings suggest that changes in relative RGS activity may filter the GPCR-generated responses, tuning response parameters to control signaling and ultimately behavior. Although intuitive, this hypothesis remains untested, as the constitutive elimination of RGS proteins typically results in an all-or-nothing impact on GPCR pathways, and compensatory changes during development further confound the interpretation of behavioral changes."

Single-photon responses generated by rod photoreceptors are transmitted to the downstream rod ON-bipolar cells (ON-BC). The high gain and rapid response of visual signals puts exquisite demands on both the timing and sensitivity of signal transmission at this synapse to enable rod reliable vision (<a href=\"#bib34\">Okawa and Sampath, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pahlberg and Sampath, 2011</a>). The transient suppression of the glutamate release from photoexcited rods is sensed by the postsynaptic GPCR, mGluR6 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Snellman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Morgans et al., 2010</a>). In darkness, mGluR6 activates a G protein, G\u03b1<sub>o</sub>, which maintains the TRPM1 effector channels closed. The opening of TRPM1 channels and resulting generation of the depolarizing response requires deactivation of G\u03b1<sub>o</sub> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dhingra et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sampath and Rieke, 2004</a>). Recent studies have indicated two RGS proteins, RGS7 and RGS11 play central role in this process (<a href=\"#bib29\">Morgans et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mojumder et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shim et al., 2012</a>). In humans, loss of function mutations in mGluR6 or TRPM1 prevent the depolarizing activity of ON-BC and result in congenital stationary night blindness (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dryja et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Audo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">van Genderen et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, knockout of mGluR6 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Masu et al., 1995</a>), TRPM1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Morgans et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Shen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Koike et al., 2010</a>), G\u03b1<sub>o</sub> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dhingra et al., 2000</a>), or RGS7/RGS11(<a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shim et al., 2012</a>) in mice also disrupts synaptic transmission between rods and ON-BC, completely abrogating responses of ON-BCs to light flashes. The total loss of signal transmission in these models has largely prevented dissection of the mechanisms that connect the fine-tuning of the GPCR signaling cascade to relevant physiological functions. Furthermore, cone photoreceptors are active under bright illumination and also signal through ON-BC neurons forming a distinct circuit. However, contributions of mGluR6 cascade elements to signal transmission at cone synapses, and their implications for vision, remain poorly understood."

                                "text": "To achieve a greater reduction in RGS concentration we developed a model for inducible RGS7 elimination. A conditional <i>Rgs7</i> allele (<i>Rgs7flx/flx</i>) was introduced in the <i>Rgs11\u2212/\u2212</i> background (cDKO) and the mice were further crossed with a ubiquitous driver line expressing inducible Cre-recombinase (cDKO:Cre+; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In the resulting model, RGS elimination can be induced postnatally by the oral administration of tamoxifen. We first characterized changes in RGS7 expression following tamoxifen administration in cDKO:Cre+ mice. Immunostaining of retinal cross-sections revealed a progressive loss of the RGS7-positive signal from the ON-BC synapses in the outer plexiform layer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). A reduction was evident in both the number of RGS7 puncta and staining intensity reaching minimal levels by day 35. During this timeframe, no changes in the postsynaptic concentration of mGluR6 were detected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We further quantified the decline in RGS7 protein by quantitative Western blotting. Similar to the immunohistochemical analysis, we detected a progressive decrease in the RGS7-positive band (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Quantitative analysis found immunostaining and Western blotting data to be in good agreement, both showing monophasic decays in the RGS7 levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We further analyzed RGS7 concentration upon tamoxifen induction separately for synapses between rods and cones, and their respective ON-BCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Before tamoxifen administration (0 day), RGS7 levels in rod and cone ON-BC synapses were comparable, showing no more than a 5 \u00b1 2% difference in staining intensity between the two. The time course of RGS7 loss induced by tamoxifen was also not different between rod and cone ON-BC synapses: half of RGS7 in rod ON-BC was found at 7.4 \u00b1 1.5 days, vs 7.8 \u00b1 1.3 days in cone ON-BCs. At day 35 following tamoxifen administration, RGS7 expression was reduced to 18 \u00b1 3% in rod ON-BCs and to 17 \u00b1 3% in cone ON-BC synapses. Importantly, the cytoarchitecture at the ON-BC dendritic tips of cDKO mice remained unaltered despite the RGS7 loss. Postsynaptic accumulations of both TRPM1 and mGluR6 and the alignment of pre- and post- synaptic compartments were both preserved (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Prior to tamoxifen administration both cDKO:Cre- and cDKO:Cre+ mice were indistinguishable from the previously characterized <i>Rgs11\u2212/\u2212</i> background strain in both RGS7 expression and localization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Furthermore, no changes in RGS7 concentration or its postsynaptic accumulation were detected upon tamoxifen administration in cDKO littermates lacking Cre recombinase expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Consistent with these observations, ERG responses recorded in cDKO:Cre- and cDKO:Cre+ mice were indistinguishable from their <i>Rgs11\u2212/\u2212</i> controls and tamoxifen administration failed to alter ERG responses in cDKO:Cre- animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thus, the observed effects are associated specifically with genomic editing of the <i>Rgs7</i> locus."

Retinas lacking RGS7 (<i>Rgs7\u2212/\u2212</i>) were used as a control. Two independent experiments yielding similar data were conducted. Note progressive loss of RGS7 immunoreactivity from postsynaptic puncta denoted by mGluR6. (<b>C</b>) Analysis of changes in RGS7 expression in total retina lysates by Western blotting. cDKO:Cre+ mice were treated with tamoxifen and retinas were collected at indicated time points. To generate retina lysates containing various RGS7 protein content, varying amounts of RGS11 knockout lysates were spiked into lysates isolated from RGS7 and RGS11 double knockout retinas (DKO). To determine the level of RGS7 reduction, a calibration curve was plotted from densities of varying amounts of RGS7 protein and used to determine the protein content in retina extracts obtained from tamoxifen-treated mice. Retinas from three separate animals were used in these experiments. (<b>D</b>) Quantification of RGS7 protein content at different time points following tamoxifen treatment. Values representing density of RGS7 band (red) and fluorescence intensity in mGluR6-positive puncta determined separately for rods (green) and cones (blue) were normalized to respective values observed before tamoxifen treatment (day 0). Averaged RGS7 percentages from western and IHC experiments are fitted with a single exponential decay function. Error bars are SEM values. (<b>E</b>) Intact synaptic morphology and retina cytoarchitecture at 28 days post-tamoxifen treatment. Retina cross-section from <i>Rgs11\u2212/\u2212</i> and cDKO:Cre+ mice were co-stained with postsynaptic marker mGluR6 and pre-synaptic marker CtBP2 and their direct apposition was noted. Immunostaining with TRPM1 (green) reveals intact morphology of ON-BC, their dendritic branching and distribution of postsynaptic puncta. <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>: assignment of rod vs cone synapses by immunohistochemistry. <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>: intact synaptic morphology and retina cytoarchitecture at 28 days post-tamoxifen treatment."

Based on immunohistochemical analysis, RGS11 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cao et al., 2009</a>), RGS7 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and mGluR6 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Masu et al., 1995</a>) are found exclusively, in the outer plexiform layer of the retina, indicating that the values that we obtained reflect protein content specifically at the ON-BC synapses. Considering that mGluR6 receptors form obligate dimers that function as a single unit, there is about threefold molar excess of RGS proteins (\u223c43 fmol) relative to mGluR6 dimer (\u223c15 fmol) in ON-BCs. In summary, these data illustrate that RGS7 loss beyond its stoichiometry with mGluR6 can be induced postnatally in a graded manner without affecting synaptic morphology or retinal cytoarchitechture."

In cDKO:Cre+ mice prior to tamoxifen administration, the delivery of very dim (scotopic) flashes, that activate rods but not cones, elicited a robust b-wave, whose generation requires the activity of rod ON-BCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These responses were indistinguishable from those observed in <i>Rgs11\u2212/\u2212</i> strain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Administration of tamoxifen to cDKO:Cre+ mice dramatically changed these responses, progressively reducing their amplitude and slowing their time course (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). We next analyzed changes in response properties across a range of flash strengths. As flash strengths increase, the contribution of cones to the overall response becomes appreciable. However, rod- and cone- driven b-waves saturate at distinct light intensities leading to a characteristic biphasic shape of the intensity-response relationship (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Accordingly, the first phase of the curve is commonly considered to consist of relatively pure rod-driven component that can be extracted mathematically (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>). Analysis of this scotopic ERG b-wave showed marked time-dependent changes in both maximal response amplitude and sensitivity (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). At 35 days following tamoxifen administration, the flash responses were barely distinguishable from the baseline seen upon constitutive elimination of both RGS7 and RGS11, with an approximately10-fold reduction in b-wave maximal amplitude and nearly a 100-fold decrease in its sensitivity. The responses further showed a time-dependent slowing in their onset, as evidenced by a progressive increase in b-waves time-to-peak and visible deceleration of the b-wave slopes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Importantly, we observed no tamoxifen-induced changes in ERG b-wave characteristics in littermates lacking Cre recombinase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), indicating that these changes are caused specifically by the progressive loss in RGS7 expression."

Whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed some variability in ON-BCs responses suggesting that efficiency of tamoxifen-induced recombination varied on a cell-by-cell basis (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). For example, we noticed that some cells were very susceptible to tamoxifen treatment and completely lost responsiveness to light, perhaps due to stochastic hyperactivation of Cre-recombinase leading to rapid elimination of RGS proteins. Because the proportion of unresponsive cells remained relatively stable (\u223c31\u201346%) across different days following tamoxifen administration, and because elimination of RGS proteins result in complete abrogation of ON-BC responses to flashes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 2012</a>), these cells were excluded from the analysis. Analysis of the remaining light-sensitive cells revealed a progressive increase in time-to-peak and concomitant decrease in maximal amplitudes following tamoxifen administration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). We next compared the average half-maximal flash strengths across all rod ON-BCs recorded on days 17, 22, 28, and 35 and found their progressive increase, reflecting a reduction in sensitivity. No changes in noise variance were detected, suggesting that reduction in RGS concentration also effectively decreases the signal-to-noise ratio (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Interestingly, the sensitivity reduction determined from patch clamp recordings matched well that obtained by ERG, which summates the responses of all cells across the retina (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In summary, we observed that gradual titration of RGS levels affects kinetics, sensitivity, and amplitude of rod ON-BC light responses."

                                "text": "Because ON-BCs making synapses with cone photoreceptors utilize a similar mGluR6-TRPM1 signaling pathway for generating depolarizing responses, we examined how changes in RGS concentration affected the light-evoked responses in cone ON-BCs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). Given low abundance of cones in murine retinas and the functional heterogeneity of cone ON-BC that they connect to, we relied exclusively on ERG for these studies. Prior to tamoxifen administration, bright (photopic) flashes produced a characteristic two-component ERG waveform in cDKO mice. In contrast, after tamoxifen administration we observed a progressive reduction in the b-wave amplitudes and kinetics without detectable changes in the a-wave (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We performed dose-response studies analyzing the dependence of photopic b-wave amplitude on flash intensity across all treatment groups. As in the case of rods, the component of the response that reflects cone contribution (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) was derived mathematically from the biphasic response profile (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The resulting traces revealed changes in cone-generated responses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) with a progressive decrease in maximal response amplitude and sensitivity. To verify that recorded responses reflected specifically changes in cone ON-BC signaling, we performed ERGs when rod function was suppressed by exposure to background light (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Light-evoked responses collected on this rod-suppressing background showed a progressive decline in b-wave amplitude and kinetics, just as for dark-adapted conditions. Quantification of the parameters derived from the analysis of intensity-response relationships indicated that maximal amplitude, sensitivity, and onset timing of the response similarly declined with time after tamoxifen administration (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). Together, these results indicate that down-regulation of RGS proteins in the cone synapses lead to changes in cone ON-BC light-evoked responses, that are similar to changes observed in rod synapses."

The optomotor response test is based on the ability of mice to respond reflexively to computer-generated rotating sine-wave gratings, which form a virtual cylinder around them (<a href=\"#bib39\">Prusky et al., 2004</a>). Previous studies have established an essential contribution of ON-pathway to visual contrast sensitivity under both scotopic and photopic conditions reflecting the critical role of both rod and cone pathways to this behavior (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schiller et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Iwakabe et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kolesnikov et al., 2011</a>). To assess scotopic contrast sensitivity change in cDKO mice we used the optimal mouse scotopic temporal frequency of 0.75 Hz in combination with a moderate stimuli speed of 7.5 deg/s (<a href=\"#bib52\">Umino et al., 2008</a>) at which the contrast sensitivity is close to maximal (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Before tamoxifen administration, both genotypes were indistinguishable in their ability to visualize rotating gratings at their contrast threshold. Tamoxifen treatment severely diminished the performance of cDKO:Cre+ mice without affecting their cDKO:Cre- littermates (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Interestingly, the deterioration of scotopic vision was somewhat resistant to tamoxifen treatment until day 22. These observations are in a good agreement with the data from the water maze task (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Thus, the loss of RGS affects mouse scotopic vision in a stereotyped manner that does not depend on the paradigm chosen to evaluate behavioral performance."

Thus, we compared how both ON-BC ERG response parameters (i.e., b-wave onset, amplitude, and sensitivity) and behavioral sensitivity varied as a function of the RGS7 concentration. These results reveal that the effect of RGS7 concentration on b-wave onset kinetics occurred with a half-saturating concentration of 37 \u00b1 2% of available protein (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Similarly, a halving of the response amplitude in rod ERG b-wave occurred at RGS7 levels of 39 \u00b1 3% of available protein (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>), and a twofold decline of scotopic response sensitivity occurred at RGS7 levels of 26 \u00b1 2% (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). A similarly sharp dependence on RGS7 levels was observed for the scotopic vision of mice (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). Animals showed a precipitous drop in their visual contrast sensitivity once the levels of RGS7 declined below \u223c35%, with 26 \u00b1 2% reflecting the half-saturating level. To compare directly changes in rod ON-BC response characteristics to behavioral performance, we calculated RGS protein concentration that produced half-saturating responses across these different measures (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>). The data reveals that rod-driven ERG response amplitudes, onset and sensitivity are disproportionately affected by changes in RGS concentration. Although measured response parameters are interrelated by their underlying biochemical mechanism, they correlate differentially with the mouse behavioral performance. For example, a threefold reduction in response amplitude and a twofold deceleration of ERG b-wave onset did not appear to have an appreciable effect on scotopic visual performance. Instead, mouse scotopic behavior tightly correlated with the rod ON-BC response sensitivity, albeit compounded by pronounced changes in other response parameters."

Through genetic manipulations we observed graded alterations in the maximal response amplitudes, timing of response onset, and sensitivity of rod and cone ON-BCs, while testing the effect of these changes on mouse visual performance. We found stark differences between rod- and cone-driven ON circuits with respect to the influence of signal transfer parameters on visually-guided behavior. In the rod circuitry, changes in the timing or amplitude of signal transmission between photoreceptors and ON-BC neurons did not affect behavioral performance in visually-guided tasks that required intact dim vision. However, a change in the sensitivity of transmission at this synapse, albeit aggravated by kinetic deficits, was not tolerated behaviorally and loss of the response sensitivity strictly correlated with the decrease in behavioral performance of the animals. In contrast, cone-mediated vision was sensitive to minor changes in kinetic parameters of signal transmission, causing a pronounced decrease in behavioral performance even when light sensitivity was unaffected. The rod circuit is biased for high sensitivity to detect single photon absorptions close to absolute visual threshold (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pahlberg and Sampath, 2011</a>), whereas cone pathways operate at higher light levels and require the capacity to extract temporal features from light stimuli (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rodieck, 1998</a>).

In ON-BCs, decreasing concentrations of two RGS proteins expressed in dendritic tips, RGS7 and RGS11, sequentially influence the onset timing, amplitude, and sensitivity of mGluR6-mediated responses (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). In this pathway, response kinetics and amplitude appeared to be the parameters most sensitive to changes in RGS concentration, whereas sensitivity required a much larger reduction in RGS concentration to produce an impact. There is a window in the RGS concentration range where profound effects on kinetics were not accompanied by appreciable changes in response sensitivity. These observations suggest a mechanism by which GPCRs can generate unique patterns of activity and differentially tune circuit properties based on varying levels of RGS proteins. Thus, regulatory nodes where information processing is mediated by GPCRs may be tuned to extract temporal features at one end of the RGS concentration range, whereas others may serve as sensitivity filters at the other end of the range. This possibility is supported by observations in photoreceptors where manipulation of RGS9 concentration affects temporal characteristics of the response without changes in sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Krispel et al., 2006</a>) and in hippocampal pyramidal neurons where knockout of RGS proteins changes both response kinetics and sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib55\">Xie et al., 2010</a>).

Upon light exposure, the activity of mGluR6 is reduced, and reduction in Go-GTP catalyzed by RGS proteins becomes dominant, allowing channels to open. When concentration of RGS proteins decline below a threshold point the speed of Go deactivation becomes rate-limiting to reduce the speed and magnitude of TRPM1 channel opening as well as its sensitivity to the reduction in glutamate concentration."

Rod ON-BCs tolerate an almost 75% reduction in RGS levels before any measurable effects on response properties could be observed. To understand the basis for this overexpression we compared levels of RGS7 and RGS11 to that of the mGluR6 receptors. We found that RGS proteins are present at approximately threefold stoichiometric excess over mGluR6 dimers. Several recent studies suggest that the signal transduction components of the ON-BC are organized in a macromolecular complex (<a href=\"#bib28\">Morgans et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dhingra and Vardi, 2012</a>). Indeed, both RGS7 and RGS11 form physical complexes with mGluR6 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cao et al., 2009</a>) and a recently discovered orphan receptor GPR179 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Orlandi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ray et al., 2014</a>). These interactions are required for proper postsynaptic targeting of RGS7/11 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Orlandi et al., 2012</a>). The expression of RGS proteins also depends on mGluR6, and its elimination in mice significantly decreases RGS7 and RGS11 levels (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cao et al., 2009</a>). Additionally, mGluR6 and its effector channel TRPM1 are further integrated by a scaffolding protein, nyctalopin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pearring et al., 2011</a>). The relatively rapid (\u223c50\u2013100 ms) response of ON-BCs to flashes of light is unlikely to be supported by the stochastic action of RGS proteins if they were deactivating G\u03b1<sub>o</sub> in the vicinity of TRPM1 simply by diffusion. Thus, these considerations suggest a model where functionally relevant RGS molecules must be physically integrated into the macromolecular signaling complex. Since RGS proteins are present in the molar excess over the mGluR6 complex, their depletion does not alter the signaling until the level reaches the stoichiometric threshold and RGS is reduced within the macromolecular assembly. Therefore, it seems reasonable to speculate that overexpression of RGS proteins over the stoichiometry with the mGluR6 signaling complex would minimize fluctuation in the kinetics and sensitivity of ON-BC responses, ensuring their reproducibility. In support of this hypothesis we find that titration of RGS proteins below a certain threshold point (\u223c1:1 stoichiometry with mGluR6 complex) detrimentally affects the signal-to-noise ratio of ON-BC responses and increases their variability."

Previous studies in rod photoreceptors that utilize similar G protein cascade for light reception demonstrated that G protein deactivation limits the recovery of a photoresponse. In these neurons, increase in the concentration of RGS protein (RGS9) resulted in acceleration of the response termination kinetics (<a href=\"#bib21\">Krispel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Burns and Pugh, 2009</a>). Since a reduction in mGluR6 activity underlies the light-evoked responses in ON-BCs (compared to an increase in rhodopsin's activity for phototransduction), G protein deactivation drives the activation phase of the response and RGS proteins influence its slope. By titrating the RGS concentration in the ON-BCs we found a critical threshold point, below which the onset of the ON-BC depolarization is sensitive to changes in G protein deactivation. The critical threshold point roughly corresponds to \u223c25% of normal RGS levels (contributed by both RGS7 and RGS11) in wild-type synapses. Notably, a substantial excess in RGS concentration (threefold to fourfold), and hence G protein deactivation rates above this threshold, has no influence on ON-BC response properties. Thus, by setting the levels of RGS expression above this threshold, mGluR6 signaling in ON-BCs ensures that G protein deactivation is not a rate-limiting step in generation of a depolarizing response. Instead, this rate-limiting reaction could be associated with either TRPM1 channel opening or intrinsic deactivation of the mGluR6 receptor. Determining the identity of this rate limiting process that drives the onset of ON-BC depolarizing response will be an important area for future investigation."

Given monosynaptic connectivity between rods and rod ON-BCs, and the progressive night blindness associated with RGS loss, the implications of these changes for rod-mediated behavior are rather unequivocal. However, signaling of cones via parallel ON- and OFF- circuits, together with the heterogeneous nature of cone ON-BCs, complicates the interpretation of the dependence of photopic (cone) vision on cone-to-cone ON-BC signal transmission. The ability to discriminate changes in luminance across a broad range of stimulation frequencies is characteristic feature of photopic vision in many species, including mice (<a href=\"#bib52\">Umino et al., 2008</a>). Previous studies have indicated that pharmacological or genetic blockade of the ON-pathway affects contrast sensitivity in mice and monkeys under photopic conditions (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schiller et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Iwakabe et al., 1997</a>). In line with these observations, we find that changes in amplitude and kinetics of the photopic ERG b-wave caused by the loss of RGS expression result in pronounced deficits in the temporal properties of contrast detection for cone vision. Ablation of RGS proteins severely impacted photopic contrast sensitivity for high-speed visual stimuli while leaving visual acuity relatively unaffected. This highlights an essential role that temporal regulation of mGluR6-TRPM1 signaling at the cone-to-cone ON-BC synapse plays for normal photopic vision. Although the details on how RGS proteins may contribute to the responses of individual cone ON-BCs remain to be established, it is possible that differential expression of RGS7 vs RGS11 at cone ON-BC synapses (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mojumder et al., 2009</a>) may contribute to setting their unique profiles, thus increasing the temporal resolution of cone vision."

After four washes with PBS with 0.1% Triton, sections were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies in PT2 for 1 hr. After four washes, sections were mounted in Fluoromount (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Images were taken with a Leica SP800 confocal microscope. Quantitative analysis of immunofluorescence from confocal images was performed using Leica software. At each time point (day: 0, 12, 17, 22, 28, 35) immunohistochemical staining of cDKO:Cre+ was repeated twice and at least two sections obtained from two individual animals were used for analysis and averaging. Sections were double stained for RGS7 and marker protein mGluR6, which co-localizes with RGS7. Positive staining of mGluR6 was used as a reference for the normalization of the recorded fluorescence intensity in the channel containing RGS7 protein. Rod and cone synapses were differentiated by: (i) counter staining with PNA and/or b-arrestin that specifically label cone terminals, (ii) sublamina position in the outer plexiform layer, (iii) specific clustering pattern of synapses at cone terminals. The fluorescence intensity within synaptic puncta was analyzed using line-scan mode and a constant puncta-encircling area, which tightly surrounded the contours of each puncta. Mean intensity (measured in pixels) were averaged across \u223c20 individual punctas per imaged section, taking three sections per retina, and two to three retinas used per time point. Imaging parameters were the same for all sections and retinas. Values for groups were normalized using pre-tamoxifen RGS7 values as a 100% percentage of protein remaining. RGS7 protein percentages were plotted vs the tamoxifen time course and fitted nicely with a simple decay function in GraphPad Prism 6."

Mice are natural swimmers and this task exploits their innate inclination to escape from water to a solid substrate. This task uses an ability of a mouse to see a visible platform with a timed escape from water, as an index of its visual ability. Before testing, mice readily learned to swim to the visible escape-platform and performance usually plateaued at around 10 s within 15 trials for all treated groups. Mice which did not learn the task, for example, performance did not improve or plateau for at least the last three or more consecutive trials or had any visible motor deficits were discarded from the experiment. Visual-guided behavior was tested at 100, 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 cd/m<sup>2</sup> and timed performances from 20 trials (four sessions of five trials each) for each mouse at each light-intensity were averaged. Uniform room luminance settings were stably achieved by an engineered adjustable light-source and constantly monitored with a luminance meter LS-100 (Konica Minolta, Tokyo, Japan). To be certain that we were measuring the mice's visual ability only and not memory, the platform was placed pseudo-randomly in the water tank and all external visual cues were eliminated."

Briefly, the animal was placed on a pedestal surrounded by four computer monitors and observed using infrared-sensitive television camera. For scotopic measurements, a round array of six infrared LEDs mounted above the platform was used to visualize the animal. Mice responded to visual stimuli (sine-wave vertical gratings presented by computer using staircase paradigm and invisible to the experimenter), by reflexively rotating their head in either clockwise or counterclockwise direction. The observer's task was to track the direction of optomotor responses and report it to the computer which determined the correctness of the choice (<a href=\"#bib39\">Prusky et al., 2004</a>). Photopic visual acuity was determined as the threshold for spatial frequency (Fs) of the stimuli at 100% contrast. Contrast sensitivity was defined as the inverse of obtained contrast threshold values. Photopic responses of constitutive RGS7/11 DKO mice were measured at un-attenuated luminance of monitors (70 cd/m<sup>2</sup> at the mouse eye level), over a range of various Sp, from 3 to 50 deg/s. Fs of stimuli was kept constant at its optimal value of 0.128 cyc/deg for all speed regimes thus providing a range of corresponding temporal frequencies (Ft) from 0.38 to 6.4 Hz, according to following equation: Ft = Sp \u00d7 Fs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Umino et al., 2008</a>). Photopic contrast sensitivities of cDKO mice were determined at specified low (6 deg/s) or high (50 deg/s) Sp at 70 cd/m<sup>2</sup> luminance level. Scotopic contrast sensitivity of cDKO mice was evaluated at optimal values of Ft (0.75 Hz) and Sp (0.1 cyc/deg), and a corresponding stimuli speed of 7.5 deg/s. In this mode, the monitor luminance was attenuated to \u223c3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup> cd/m<sup>2</sup> by several neutral density film filters that formed a cylinder around the animal.

However, it is crucial to demonstrate that the amplitudes plotted here are genuinely rod-driven, and unfortunately the raw data are not illustrated. What needs to be shown are sets of actual b-wave responses, across the full range of flash intensities, together with the extraction of the rod-driven and cone-driven components; these responses are not available, and so it is not possible to evaluate the measurements. Likewise, the fits of <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a> (in the subsection headed \u201cElectroretinography\u201d) to the measured amplitudes are not illustrated; these fits need to be illustrated for two reasons. First, it seems unusual that an exponent of unity (rather than a power law) is being applied. But secondly, the magnitude of the cone-driven component (listed in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) is so large (&gt;600 uV, even larger than the rod-driven component of \u223c500 uV) that the extraction of the rod-driven component appears susceptible to the precise fitting procedures; however, the significance of this potential problem cannot be evaluated with seeing the results."

The caption and axis label refer to \u201cHalf-saturation (normalized) response\u201d as a percentage of maximal.

In the absence of measurements at lower concentrations, this appears somewhat implausible. For example, in panel C, why would the half-saturation intensity suddenly stop increasing as the <i>Rgs7</i> concentration dropped below 20%? And hence, how reliable is this asymptotic level (which is used for curve fitting)? For the data in panel C, it would seem much more informative to plot sensitivity (rather than insensitivity), and to determine the level of <i>Rgs7</i> that halves the sensitivity."

The apparent difference in the dependence of photopic and scotopic behavioral sensitivity on RGS concentration is a particularly interesting result of the paper, and it is highlighted as such in the Discussion. Interpretation of this result is difficult, however, since the behavioral task itself differed. How can you rule out that the difference reflects the different task rather than the difference in light level and which retinal circuits are active? Specifically, the concern would be that the sensitivity to changes in the time course of the bipolar responses under photopic conditions reflects the use of a task requiring detection of flickering light inputs, while the task used under scotopic conditions may impose less stringent constraints on temporal sensitivity. This is a critical issue as it undercuts what is probably the most interesting result in the paper. I think it is essential that the same behavioral task be used to evaluate signaling via rod and cone circuits."

Why would this be the case? Sensitivity is a somewhat artificial measurement from a biological perspective because of the normalization, so it is particular unexpected that behavior tracks it rather than response amplitude. Could initially both signal and noise decline with declining RGS concentration such that behavioral threshold remains fixed? If this is the case, it should be apparent from noise recorded in the rod bipolar cells. An expanded discussion of this issue is needed."

The authors should attempt to explain to the reader how the cellular losses explain the specific behavioral deficits. To me, most of the defects (except for that in panel F) seem modest, and thus the behavioral data mainly show that normal ON-bipolar signaling is needed for completely normal visual function. However, the results also show that the loss of these signals does not lead to blindness (complete loss of visual function)."

For example, it is still problematic to compare the ERG recordings (done with flashes ranging from dim to bright, in darkness or on a single rod-saturating background) with either the behavioral experiments (done at a range of room luminances) or with the OKR measurements (done at visual threshold). The new data in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> are likewise difficult to interpret, because they seem to be dominated by oscillatory potentials which are not even mentioned; instead the authors appear to take some unspecified measurement within those oscillations as representing the photopic b-wave, because the points plotted in D and E seem very different from what I get looking at the traces in C. Also, it had previously escaped my notice that, while the authors make a big point of the slowing of the ERG b-wave time course in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, they do not comment on the corresponding results for single-cell recordings; inspection of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> suggests that the phenomenon may be very different in the rod ON-BCs themselves."

The authors used whole retinas for their quantitative Western blottings; however, mGluR6 and <i>Rgs11</i> are present only in ON bipolar cells while <i>Rgs7</i> is present also in the IPL. I saw no attempt to correct for that. If <i>Rgs7</i> is distributed equally in OPL and IPL (a guess from immunolocalization), then the amount of <i>Rgs7</i> will be reduced to about 10 fM and <i>Rgs7+Rgs11</i> will equal mGluR6 amount. This quantification is important for understanding the composition of the mGluR6-related macromolecule and the mechanism for the light response. As analyzed here, it appears that RGSs are at excess, but if the IPL is factored in, then each mGluR6 molecule may have only one RGS molecule to modify its cascade. In fact, if the mGluR6 receptor functions as a dimer, then each receptor will have two RGS molecules, a more realistic outcome. This concern however, does not affect the conclusions of the paper regarding the difference between rods and cones (it may affect the Discussion)."

Photopic behavior was measured at higher speeds, since only at those speeds did ON bipolar signaling appear to influence the OKR under photopic conditions.

How can you rule out that the difference reflects the different task rather than the difference in light level and which retinal circuits are active? Specifically, the concern would be that the sensitivity to changes in the time course of the bipolar responses under photopic conditions reflects the use of a task requiring detection of flickering light inputs, while the task used under scotopic conditions may impose less stringent constraints on temporal sensitivity.

In the revised manuscript we separately evaluated changes in noise and this information can now be used to approximate changes in signal-to -noise ratio. While the signal per photon absorbed changes in magnitude (as indicated by their half-maximal flash strength), we detected no change in rod ON-BC noise (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). This indicates that the signal-to-noise ratio is declining with time following tamoxifen administration. The lack of effect on behavioral threshold with declining signal-to-noise ratio may then be a reflection of a limiting signal-to-noise ratio that is superceded by the rod ON-BC signal-to-noise ratio as it declines.

For the behavior, we used 3x10<sup>-4</sup> (OKR) and 5x10<sup>-3</sup> (water maze) cd/m2, which are significantly above the visual threshold. The reviewer is correct in pointing out the caveats of comparing electrical responses to behavior under scotopic conditions, mainly because behavioral assessment requires steady light illumination whereas electrophysiological recordings use flashes on a dark background. However, we matched the conditions, to the extent possible, and used alternative behavioral paradigms to evaluate scotopic vision. The light intensities used for the electrophysiological characterization and behavioral evaluation were in the same range corresponding to pure scotopic conditions. Using a mouse model of abrogated rod function (Gnat1-KO) we have previously determined that under those conditions cone-driven responses are negligible and do not impact OKR behavior (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kolesnikov et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, we found no discernable difference in visual function deterioration when comparing the results of OKR to water maze. Similarly, the results of single cell experiments closely matched data from ERG. Considering these points we believe that we can draw valid conclusions from comparing rod versus cone ON-BC responses and visually\u2013guided behavior mediated by rod and cone circuits."

(2011)</a> examined scotopic OKR when rod pathway function was severely reduced but not completely eliminated (Gngt1 knockout). In that paper, we found that diminishing rod signaling produces parallel down-ward shift in the behavioral performance across spatial frequencies shifting only light sensitivity. Because loss of synaptic transmission (induced by RGS proteins in the ON-BC) is expected to have similar effect on vision as decrease in rod photosensitivity, we do not expect our cDKO model to be any different in terms of the temporal frequency dependence."

We also performed quantification of histochemical architecture in cDKO retinas post tamoxifen treatment.

Although we agree that having single cell data would have been ideal, obtaining a sufficient data set for the analysis of tamoxifen inducible changes in this rare neuronal population was not feasible in the set of experiments presented (note that the data on OFF cone bipolar cells in Arman and Sampath (2012) required nearly 1.5 years to collect, and this is for one time point). However, we do evaluate the average cone-driven responses of cone ON-BC by ERGs and compare their properties to rod-driven ON-BC responses, with little difference in respect to how parameters of interest in these two neuronal populations respond to change in RGS concentration."
