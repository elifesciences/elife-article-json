Here we report that loss of <i>Drosophila HNF4</i> recapitulates hallmark symptoms of MODY1, including adult-onset hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). These defects are linked to a role for dHNF4 in promoting mitochondrial function as well as the expression of <i>Hex-C</i>, a homolog of the MODY2 gene <i>Glucokinase. dHNF4</i> is required in the fat body and insulin-producing cells to maintain glucose homeostasis by supporting a developmental switch toward oxidative phosphorylation and GSIS at the transition to adulthood. These findings establish an animal model for MODY1 and define a developmental reprogramming of metabolism to support the energetic needs of the mature animal."

Here we report that loss of <i>Drosophila HNF4</i> recapitulates hallmark symptoms of MODY1, including adult-onset hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). These defects are linked to a role for dHNF4 in promoting mitochondrial function as well as the expression of <i>Hex-C</i>, a homolog of the MODY2 gene <i>Glucokinase. dHNF4</i> is required in the fat body and insulin-producing cells to maintain glucose homeostasis by supporting a developmental switch toward oxidative phosphorylation and GSIS at the transition to adulthood. These findings establish an animal model for MODY1 and define a developmental reprogramming of metabolism to support the energetic needs of the mature animal."

However, there are some rare forms of diabetes that are caused simply by mutations in single genes and are directly inherited. For example, it has been known for twenty years that a type of diabetes called \u201cMaturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 1\u201d (or MODY1 for short) occurs when a gene called <i>HNF4</i> is mutated or deleted. The symptoms of MODY1 usually appear during early adulthood and include abnormally high levels of sugar in the blood, as well as the pancreas not being able to release the hormone insulin properly in response to these sugars."

However, these mouse models did not fully recreate the symptoms of this disorder and the precise role of HNF4 in preventing diabetes remains unclear.

Furthermore, flies and mammals use many of the same pathways to control metabolism, making the fly a good model for the disease in humans."

These symptoms included high sugar levels and decreased production of insulin-like hormones. The experiments also showed that <i>HNF4</i> normally supports the proper expression of another gene called <i>Hex-C</i>; this gene encodes a protein that senses how much sugar is available and helps to keep the amount of sugar circulating the body within normal levels. Barry and Thummel went on to discover that the <i>HNF4</i> gene is required for the expression of some genes in structures called mitochondria, which provide most of the energy used by animal cells. Lastly, the <i>HNF4</i> gene became more active as the flies matured, and appeared to help the metabolism of a developing fruit fly transition towards that of an adult."

Although genetics and environment have a significant impact on diabetes susceptibility, severity, and care, the causal factors are often complex and unclear. Several cases of familial diabetes have been identified, however, that show clear patterns of heritability due to monogenic disease alleles, highlighting these genes as critical factors for glycemic control. To date, mutations in 13 genes have been shown to cause autosomal dominant inheritance of Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY1-13), representing the most common forms of monogenic diabetes. MODY patients typically present with hyperglycemia and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by young adulthood, while having normal body weight and lacking \u03b2-cell autoimmunity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fajans and Bell, 2011</a>). Consistent with this, several genes associated with MODY have well-characterized functions in glucose homeostasis, including the glycolytic enzyme <i>Glucokinase</i> (GCK/MODY2), and <i>Insulin</i> (INS/MODY10). Mechanistic insight into the anti-diabetic roles of other MODY genes, however, remains limited."

HNF4A is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-regulated transcription factors, which play important roles in the regulation of growth, development, and metabolic homeostasis. Studies in mice demonstrated a critical requirement for <i>Hnf4A</i> in early development, with null mutants dying during embryogenesis due to defects in gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 1994</a>). Heterozygotes, however, show no apparent phenotypes. As a result, tissue-specific genetic studies were used to investigate the functions of <i>Hnf4A</i> in key tissues where it is expressed, including the liver, kidney, intestine, and pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Two groups generated adult mice deficient for <i>Hnf4A</i> in \u03b2-cells with the goal of modeling MODY1 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gupta et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Miura et al., 2006</a>). Although both studies reported impaired glucose tolerance in <i>Hnf4A</i> deficient mice, along with defects in GSIS, neither study observed sustained hypoinsulinemic hyperglycemia \u2013 the defining symptom that brings MODY1 patients to the clinic.

The spatial expression patterns of the fly and mammalian receptors are also conserved through evolution, raising the possibility that they share regulatory activities (<a href=\"#bib49\">Palanker et al., 2009</a>). In support of this, our previous studies of <i>dHNF4</i> mutant larvae demonstrated a critical role in fatty acid catabolism, leading to defects in lipid homeostasis that are similar to those caused by liver-specific <i>HNF4A</i> deficiency in mammals (<a href=\"#bib49\">Palanker et al., 2009</a>). Here we report the first functional study of <i>dHNF4</i> mutants at the adult stage of development. Our studies show that adult <i>dHNF4</i> mutants display the hallmark symptoms of MODY1, including hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and impaired GSIS. Metabolomic analysis of <i>dHNF4</i> mutants revealed coordinated changes in metabolites that are indicative of diabetes, along with an unexpected effect on mitochondrial activity. This was further evident in our RNA-seq and ChIP-seq studies, which indicate that <i>dHNF4</i> is required for the proper transcription of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). A homolog of mammalian <i>GCK, Hex-C</i>, is also under-expressed in mutants. <i>dHNF4</i> appears to act through these pathways to promote GSIS in the IPCs and glucose clearance by the fat body. In addition, we show that <i>dHNF4</i> expression increases dramatically at the onset of adulthood, along with its downstream transcriptional programs. These studies suggest that <i>dHNF4</i> triggers a developmental transition that establishes the metabolic state of the adult fly, promoting GSIS and OXPHOS to support the energetic needs of the mature animal."

While testing for potential dietary effects on <i>dHNF4</i> mutant viability, we discovered that sugar levels have a dramatic influence on their survival. When reared on either standard cornmeal food or a medium containing 15% sugar (2:1 glucose to sucrose, 8% yeast), less than 30% of mutant animals survive though eclosion, and the rest die primarily during the first day of adulthood (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>).

As a result, these metabolites can accumulate to high levels in diabetics and correlate with neuropathy and nephropathy (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gabbay, 1975</a>). <i>dHNF4</i> mutants also display increased levels of inosine, adenine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid, which are purine metabolites that are associated with increased diabetes risk and diabetic nephropathy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Johnson et al., 2013</a>). Taken together, these findings reveal additional similarities between the <i>dHNF4</i> mutant phenotype and the metabolic complications of diabetes in humans. Finally, in addition to elevated carbohydrates, we observed increased levels of pyruvate and lactate accompanied by decreased levels of ATP, suggesting a potential defect in mitochondrial respiration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>)."

Interestingly, <i>dHNF4</i> mutants display specific alterations in these metabolites, with increased abundance of citrate, aconitate, isocitrate, fumarate and malate, along with decreased levels of alpha-ketoglutarate and succinate, suggesting a specific block in TCA cycle progression (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

A total of 1370 genes are differentially expressed in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants (\u22651.5-fold change, 1% FDR), with just over half of these genes showing reduced abundance (726 down, 644 up) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Gene ontology analysis revealed that the majority of the down-regulated genes correspond to metabolic functions, with the most significant category corresponding to oxidoreductases (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). In contrast, the up-regulated genes largely correspond to the innate immune response, reflecting a possible inflammatory response in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Interestingly, most of the transcripts encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) are expressed at greatly reduced levels in mutant animals (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, as in humans, the mitochondrial genome contains 13 protein-coding genes, all of which encode critical components of the electron transport chain (ETC) that contribute to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Further analysis of these transcripts by northern blot hybridization confirmed their reduced expression in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants, corresponding to mtDNA genes involved in Complex I (<i>mt:ND1, mt:ND2, mt:ND4, mt:ND5</i>), Complex IV (<i>mt:Cox1, mt:Cox2, mt:Cox3</i>) and Complex V/ATP synthase (<i>mt:ATPase6, mt:ATPase8</i>), along with reduced levels of the mitochondrial large ribosomal RNA (<i>mt:lrRNA</i>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Importantly, not all mtDNA genes are misregulated, as the expression of <i>mt:Cyt-b</i> is consistently unaltered in mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In addition, the copy number of mtDNA is unaffected in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants, suggesting that mitochondrial abundance is normal in these animals (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

The mRNA abundance for each gene in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants is indicated (red text) relative to matched controls from RNA-seq data. These genes are predicted to affect enzymatic complexes for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2), alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (\u03b1-KGDH), succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), or succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). Consistent with impaired IDH and SCS activity, levels of alpha-ketoglutarate and succinate are reduced, while upstream citrate, aconitate, and isocitrate accumulate. The modest effect on succinate abundance is possibly due to a combined effect of impaired succinate production balanced by decreased succinate oxidation resulting from impaired SDH activity.

This may contribute to the elevated levels of fumarate and downstream malate independent of impaired SDH activity.

Our initial functional analysis of <i>dHNF4</i> target genes supports these tissue-specific activities and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of <i>dHNF4</i> action. Tissue-specific inactivation of <i>Hex-C</i> by RNAi demonstrates that it is required in the fat body, but not the IPCs, to maintain normal levels of circulating glucose (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). This is consistent with the important role of mammalian <i>GCK</i> for glucose clearance by the liver as well as its association with MODY2 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Postic et al., 1999</a>). In contrast, both fat body and IPC-specific RNAi for the direct target of dHNF4, <i>CG5599,</i> significantly impaired glucose homeostasis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>).

Accordingly, we examined if <i>dHNF4</i> mutants display defects in GSIS. We used an experimental approach developed for this purpose in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae, assaying for the steady-state levels of DILP2 peptide in the IPCs using a fasting/refeeding paradigm (<a href=\"#bib22\">Geminard et al., 2009</a>). As expected, DILP2 accumulates in the IPCs of fasted control animals and is effectively released into circulation in response to glucose feeding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). In contrast, while DILP2 accumulates normally in fasted <i>dHNF4</i> mutants, it fails to respond to dietary glucose stimulation, despite these animals having normal IPC number and morphology (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Peripheral insulin signaling is also reduced in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants relative to controls, consistent with their reduced GSIS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This defect in GSIS is due to a tissue-specific requirement for <i>dHNF4</i> in the IPCs since IPC-specific RNAi for <i>dHNF4</i> resulted in impaired DILP2 secretion into the hemolymph, along with reduced peripheral insulin signaling (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Park et al., 2014</a>).

It is, however, expressed in the IPCs of the adult fly, consistent with its central roles at this stage in GSIS, insulin signaling, and glucose homeostasis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Interestingly, this cell-type specific switch in <i>dHNF4</i> expression correlates with a developmental change in IPC physiology. Unlike mammalian \u03b2-cells, larval IPCs fail to secrete DILPs in response to dietary glucose (<a href=\"#bib22\">Geminard et al., 2009</a>). Adult IPCs, however, display calcium influx, membrane depolarization, and DILP2 secretion in response to glucose, analogous to \u03b2-cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alfa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fridell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kreneisz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Park et al., 2014</a>). Along with the temporal induction of dHNF4 expression in adult IPCs, these results suggest that there is a developmental switch in the response to glucose at the onset of adulthood. Consistent with this, glucose feeding activates insulin signaling in adult flies, but not in larvae (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This correlates with a ~ten-fold increase in the basal circulating levels of glucose in adults compared to larvae, which first becomes apparent during the final stages of pupal development (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tennessen et al., 2014a</a>). Moreover, <i>dHNF4</i> mutants maintain euglycemia on a normal diet during larval and early pupal stages, but display hyperglycemia just prior to eclosion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

These include genes identified in our previous study of <i>dHNF4</i> in larvae that act in lipid metabolism and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation, analogous to the role of <i>Hnf4A</i> in the mouse liver to maintain normal levels of stored and circulating lipids (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hayhurst et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Palanker et al., 2009</a>).

Unlike mice lacking <i>GCK</i> in the \u03b2-cells, however, we do not see an effect on glucose homeostasis when <i>Hex-C</i> is targeted by RNAi in the IPCs.

Although our work described here suggests that key activities for this receptor have been conserved in flies and mammals, corresponding to the roles of HNF4 in the IPCs (\u03b2-cells) for GSIS, fat body (liver) for lipid metabolism and glucose clearance, and intestine to suppress inflammation, there are likely to be divergent roles as well.

The observation that <i>Drosophila</i> do not have identifiable homologs for <i>HNF1A</i> and <i>HNF1B</i> raises the interesting possibility that <i>dHNF4</i> alone replaces this autoregulatory circuit in more primitive organisms. The related phenotype of these disorders is further emphasized by cases of MODY3 that are caused by mutation of an HNF4A binding site within the <i>HNF1A</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gragnoli et al., 1997</a>). Consistent with this link, MODY1, MODY3 and MODY5 display similar features of disease complication and progression, and studies of HNF1A and HNF4A in INS-1 cells have implicated roles for these transcription factors in promoting mitochondrial metabolism in \u03b2-cells (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2002</a>). In line with this, mitochondrial diabetes is clearly age progressive, as are MODY1, 3, and 5, but not MODY2, which represents a more mild form of this disorder. Furthermore, the severity and progression of MODY3 is significantly enhanced when patients carry an additional mutation in either HNF4A or mtDNA (<a href=\"#bib16\">Forlani et al., 2010</a>). Overall, these observations are consistent with the well-established multifactorial nature of diabetes, with multiple distinct metabolic insults contributing to disease onset."

                                "text": "An unexpected and significant discovery in our studies is that dHNF4 is required for mitochondrial gene expression and function. Several lines of evidence support the model that dHNF4 exerts this effect through direct regulation of mitochondrial transcription, although a number of additional experiments are required to draw firm conclusions on this regulatory connection. First, most of the 13 protein-coding genes in mtDNA are underexpressed in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Our lab and others have conducted RNA-seq studies of <i>Drosophila</i> nuclear transcription factor mutants and, to our knowledge, similar effects on mitochondrial gene expression have not been reported previously. Second, dHNF4 protein is abundantly bound to the control region of the mitochondrial genome, representing the fifth strongest enrichment peak in our ChIP-seq dataset (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Although the promoters in <i>Drosophila</i> mtDNA have not yet been identified, the site bound by dHNF4 corresponds to a predicted promoter region for <i>Drosophila</i> mitochondrial transcription and coincides with the location of the major divergent promoters in human mtDNA (<a href=\"#bib19\">Garesse and Kaguni, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Roberti et al., 2006</a>). It is unlikely that the abundance of mtDNA relative to nuclear DNA had an effect on our ChIP-seq peak calling because the MACS2 platform used for our analysis accounts for local differences in read depth across the genome (including the abundance of mtDNA). In addition, although the D-loop in mtDNA has been proposed to contribute to possible false-positive ChIP-seq peaks in mammalian studies (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marinov et al., 2014</a>), the D-loop structure is not present in <i>Drosophila</i> mtDNA (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rubenstein et al., 1977</a>). Nonetheless, additional experiments are required before we can conclude that this apparent binding is of regulatory significance for mitochondrial function. Third, the effects on mitochondrial gene expression do not appear to be due to reduced mitochondrial number in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This is consistent with the normal expression of <i>mt:Cyt-b</i> in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), which has a predicted upstream promoter that drives expression of the <i>mt:Cyt-b</i> and mt:<i>ND6</i> operon (although we could not detect <i>mt:ND6</i> RNA in our northern blot studies) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berthier et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Roberti et al., 2006</a>). Fourth, immunostaining for dHNF4 shows cytoplasmic protein that overlaps with the mitochondrial marker ATP5A, in addition to its expected nuclear localization (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Some of the cytoplasmic staining, however, clearly fails to overlap with the mitochondrial marker, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions from this experiment. Multiple efforts to expand on this question biochemically with subcellular fractionation studies have been complicated by abundant background proteins that co-migrate with the receptor in mitochondrial extracts. We are currently developing new reagents to detect the relatively low levels of endogenous dHNF4 protein in mitochondria, including use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for the addition of specific epitope tags to the endogenous <i>dHNF4</i> locus. Finally, we observe multiple hallmarks of mitochondrial dysfunction, including elevated pyruvate and lactate, specific alterations in TCA cycle metabolites, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced levels of ATP, and fragmented mitochondrial morphology. These phenotypes are consistent with the reduced expression of key genes involved in mitochondrial OXPHOS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), and studies showing that decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production are commonly associated with mitochondrial fragmentation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mishra and Chan, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Toyama et al., 2016</a>)."

A number of nuclear transcription factors have been localized to mitochondria, including ATFS-1, MEF2D, CREB, p53, STAT3, along with several nuclear receptors, including the estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and the p43 isoform of the thyroid hormone receptor (<a href=\"#bib32\">Leigh-Brown et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nargund et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Szczepanek et al., 2012</a>). The significance of these observations, however, remains largely unclear, with few studies demonstrating regulatory functions within mitochondria. In addition, these factors lack a canonical mitochondrial localization signal at their amino-terminus, leaving it unclear how they achieve their subcellular distribution (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marinov et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, one of the five mRNA isoforms encoded by <i>dHNF4, dHNF4-B</i>, encodes a predicted mitochondrial localization signal in its 5\u2019-specific exon, providing a molecular mechanism to explain the targeting of this nuclear receptor to this organelle. Efforts are currently underway to conduct a detailed functional analysis of <i>dHNF4-B</i> by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete its unique 5\u2019 exon, as well as establishing transgenic lines that express a tagged version of <i>dHNF4-B</i> under UAS control. Future studies using these reagents, along with our <i>dHNF4</i> mutants, should allow us to dissect the nuclear and mitochondrial functions of this nuclear receptor and their respective contributions to systemic physiology."

The evolutionary conservation of the physiological functions of HNF4A, from flies to mammals, combined with these prior studies, argue that more effort should be directed at defining the subcellular distribution of HNF4A protein and its potential roles within mitochondria.

Subsequent classical experiments in <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Bombyx</i>, <i>Rhodnius</i> and <i>Calliphora</i> showed that this reduction in mitochondrial respiration during metamorphosis and dramatic rise in early adults is seen in multiple insect species, including <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bodine, 1925</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Merkey et al., 2011</a>). Consistent with this, the activity of oxidative enzyme systems and the levels of ATP also follow a \u201cU-shaped curve\u201d during development as the animal transitions from a non-feeding pupa to a motile and reproductively active adult fly (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agrell, 1953</a>). Although first described over 150 years ago, the regulation of this developmental increase in mitochondrial activity has remained undefined. Here we show that this temporal switch is dependent, at least in part, on the dHNF4 nuclear receptor. The levels of <i>dHNF4</i> expression increase dramatically at the onset of adulthood, accompanied by the expression of downstream genes that act in glucose homeostasis and mitochondrial OXPHOS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). This coordinate transcriptional switch is reduced in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants, indicating that the receptor plays a key role in this transition. Importantly, the timing of this program correlates with the onset of <i>dHNF4</i> mutant phenotypes in young adults, including sugar-dependent lethality, hyperglycemia, and defects in GSIS, indicating that the upregulation of <i>dHNF4</i> expression in adults is of functional significance. It should also be noted, however, that <i>dHNF4</i> target genes are still induced at the onset of adulthood in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants, albeit at lower levels, indicating that other regulators contribute to this switch in metabolic state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Nonetheless, the timing of the induction of <i>dHNF4</i> and its target genes in early adults, and its role in promoting OXPHOS, suggest that this receptor contributes to the end of the \u201cU-shaped curve\u201d and directs a systemic transcriptional switch that establishes an optimized metabolic state to support the energetic demands of adult life."

This switch toward aerobic glycolysis favors lactate production and flux through biosynthetic pathways over mitochondrial OXPHOS, supporting the ~200-fold increase in mass that occurs during larval development. Taken together with our work on dHNF4, these studies define a role for nuclear receptors in directing temporal switches in metabolic state that meet the changing physiological needs of different stages in development.

Similarly, the fly homologs of the mammalian ATP-sensitive potassium channel subunits, Sur1 and Kir6, which link OXPHOS and ATP production to GSIS, are not expressed in the larval IPCs but are expressed during the adult stage (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fridell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kim and Rulifson, 2004</a>). They also appear to be active at this stage as cultured IPCs from adult flies undergo calcium influx and membrane depolarization upon exposure to glucose or the anti-diabetic sulfonylurea drug glibenclamide (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kreneisz et al., 2010</a>). In addition, reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential in adult IPCs by ectopic expression of an uncoupling protein is sufficient to reduce IPC calcium influx, elevate whole-animal glucose levels, and reduce peripheral insulin signaling (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fridell et al., 2009</a>). This switch in IPC physiology is paralleled by a change in the nutritional signals that trigger DILP release. Amino acids, and not glucose, stimulate DILP2 secretion by larval IPCs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Geminard et al., 2009</a>). Rather, glucose is sensed by the corpora cardiaca in larvae, a distinct organ that secretes adipokinetic hormone, which acts like glucagon to maintain carbohydrate homeostasis during larval stages (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim and Rulifson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee and Park, 2004</a>). Interestingly, this can have an indirect effect on the larval IPCs, triggering DILP3 secretion in response to dietary carbohydrates (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kim and Neufeld, 2015</a>). Adult IPCs, however, are responsive to glucose for DILP2 release (<a href=\"#bib50\">Park et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D</a>). In addition, <i>dHNF4</i> mutants on a normal diet maintain euglycemia during larval and early pupal stages, but display hyperglycemia at the onset of adulthood, paralleling their lethal phase on a normal diet (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Taken together, these observations support the model that the IPCs change their physiological state during the larval-to-adult transition and that <i>dHNF4</i> contributes to this transition toward GSIS. The observation that glucose is a major circulating sugar in adults, but not larvae, combined with its ability to stimulate DILP2 secretion from adult IPCs, establishes this stage as an experimental context for genetic studies of glucose homeostasis, GSIS, and diabetes. Functional characterization of these pathways in adult <i>Drosophila</i> will allow us to harness the power of model organism genetics to better understand the regulation of glucose homeostasis and the factors that contribute to diabetes."

The authors make the insightful observation that mutations in HNF4 result in early adult death just after eclosion. This phenotype is rescued if the adults are fed on 3% sugar diet instead of the regular diet, which contains about 15% sugars in it. Thus, reduced carbohydrate intake increases viability of <i>HNF4</i> mutants suggesting that it might function in the regulation of sugar homeostasis. Further analysis suggests indeed that <i>HNF4</i> mutants have increased levels of free glucose and trehalose in adults and have impaired glucose tolerance and reduced levels of ATP (60-70% of the normal). The authors then use MS to determine the levels of different intermediates in glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism and find that many of the intermediates of glycolysis and the associated pathways that function in the biosynthesis of other metabolites show a significant increase when <i>HNF4</i> mutants are fed on 15% sugar diet but not when they are reared on 3% sugar diet. Consistent with these observations the authors show that loss of HNF4 causes mitochondrial fragmentation. Based on these observations that authors conclude that HNF4 functions in the metabolic reprogramming from the larval to the adult mode during development consistent with the lethality of <i>HNF4</i> mutants."

Using global analyses such as metabolomics, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq the authors find that glycolysis and mitochondrial function are altered in mutant flies. Surprisingly, the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data point to the possibility that HNF acts in the mitochondria to increase mtDNA transcription. The authors then use tissue specific knock-downs to show that glucose homeostasis is most perturbed when HNF is knocked down in the IPCs and fat body. Indeed, knock-down of HNF in the IPCs reduces DILP2 in circulation. The authors then explore the possibility that HNF triggers a developmentally regulated metabolic switch towards GSIS and OXPHOS at the onset of adulthood."

If so, this will change much about how we think mtDNA transcription is regulated. While the authors provide some evidence for this (for example ChIP-seq data), further experiments should be conducted to solidify this finding. In particular, it would be nice if the authors provide further evidence that dHNF4 is indeed targeted to mitochondria and present within the mitochondrial matrix where mtDNA resides. This could be achieved by subcellular fractionation of tissues or cells to show that dHNF4 first associates with the mitochondrial fraction and then further sub-fractionation to determine where within mitochondria it is. Along the same lines, are there any sequences in dHNF4 specifically required to target it to mitochondria? Does it possess a canonical N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence? If so, what are the phenotypic consequences of preventing mitochondrial targeting?"

In this study, in which the signal to noise ratio in nuclear genes is quite low, any background signal caused by the mtDNA might seem more important. A nice control would have been to perform the ChIP-seq in the mutant flies. The mtDNA signal should be much reduced in the mutants (assuming the mtDNA copy number is the same in mutant flies)."

Given the novelty of the finding, it would have been useful to see independent validation of mitochondrial localization using an alternative antibody or a genetic construct. In summary, whilst it is plausible that HNF is directly binding to mtDNA and regulating mtDNA transcription, further evidence, using a method that doesn't require the antibody used in this study, would make the claim more compelling. Given the interest in such a finding, further independent evidence of direct mtDNA binding would be necessary."

For example, the metabolomics data shows that HNF deletion increases glucose-derived metabolites, but the RNA-seq data suggests that glycolytic genes are down-regulated. These data are not incorrect, since the experiments and analysis were done with care and competence, but such analyses are easier to interpret if using a homogeneous extract.

Consequently, the adult phenotypes described in this manuscript could be adaptive and result from the metabolic alterations caused by dHNF4 loss during larval life (Palanker et al. 2009). The abundance of genes involved in stress and immunity in the RNA-seq dataset is consistent with this idea. The authors should knockdown dHNF4 specifically in the adult (e.g. in tubGal4, tubGal80ts&gt;dHNF4-RNAi flies) and test whether some of the key phenotypes (glucose intolerance, hyperglycemia and GSIS) are still apparent. Related to this, the specificity of the Ilp2-Gal4 used in this study (Kim et al. 2014) has not been investigated/described in larvae. Why did the authors not use the Ilp2-3-Gal4 generated in the Partridge lab, which is confined to late larva/adult IPCS? This would avoid targeting non-IPC dHNF4 expression throughout development."

Since all experiments in this paper were performed by removing dHNF4 early in development far before the onset of adulthood, it remains a possibility that the phenotypes observed are a consequence of an earlier requirement for dHNF4 during development. To show that dHNF4 is really required in adulthood we would like the authors to remove dHNF4 at the onset of adulthood in the whole organism, fat body and IPCs to assess whether the flies become diabetic and whether survival is affected. As the muscle is also a major contributor to glucose clearance the requirement of dHNF4 in muscles should be assessed as well."

If so, this will change much about how we think mtDNA transcription is regulated. While the authors provide some evidence for this (for example ChIP-seq data), further experiments should be conducted to solidify this finding. In particular, it would be nice if the authors provide further evidence that dHNF4 is indeed targeted to mitochondria and present within the mitochondrial matrix where mtDNA resides. This could be achieved by subcellular fractionation of tissues or cells to show that dHNF4 first associates with the mitochondrial fraction and then further sub-fractionation to determine where within mitochondria it is. Along the same lines, are there any sequences in dHNF4 specifically required to target it to mitochondria? Does it possess a canonical N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence? If so, what are the phenotypic consequences of preventing mitochondrial targeting?"

We have surveyed the protein isoforms encoded by all 18 canonical nuclear receptors in <i>Drosophila</i> and have found only two that carry a N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) predicted by both MITOPROT and TargetP protein localization programs. Importantly, one of these is dHNF4-B, one of the five protein isoforms encoded by the <i>dHNF4</i> locus (as we now depict in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We are using CRISPR/Cas9 to specifically delete the 5\u2019 exon that is unique to <i>dHNF4-B</i>, leaving the remaining four isoforms intact. We are also establishing a transgenic line that expresses a tagged dHNF4-B protein under UAS control. Both of these constructs are currently being injected into embryos. We are also engineering an N-terminal protein tag into the dHNF4-B-specific coding sequences to facilitate its detection, along with lines that will carry a protein tag at the C-terminus of the dHNF4 protein shared by all five isoforms. Our plans are to pursue a complete analysis of these new lines, along with our existing <i>dHNF4</i> mutant, to dissect the relative contributions of nuclear and mitochondrial function to <i>dHNF4</i> mutant phenotypes. In addition, we have initiated collaborative efforts with colleagues at the University of Utah to determine if the mitochondrial localization and function of HNF4 is conserved through evolution from flies to mammals. Taken together, these studies represent a major direction for our future research. An NIH R01 grant to support this project recently received a good score and is being resubmitted. More relevant to this paper, these detailed studies of potential functions for dHNF4 in mitochondria extend beyond what we hope to communicate in this paper, which represents a much broader initial phenotypic characterization of the adult functions for <i>dHNF4</i> in <i>Drosophila</i>."

Indeed, we were doing these experiments while the paper was out for review and have continued our efforts over the past few months. So far, we have conducted six attempts using control animals compared to <i>dHNF4</i> mutants as well as a genomic rescue transgene for dHNF4 tagged with GFP and FLAG epitope tags. These efforts, however, have been plagued by a high background of non-specific bands in mitochondrial fractions by western blot that obscure any potential signal from dHNF4. Surprisingly, these non-specific bands are seen in the highly purified mitochondrial fractions (as determined by the fractionation of specific marker proteins) but not in isolated nuclei. We have conducted these studies with a variety of different antibodies including affinity-purified guinea pig anti-dHNF4 (unpublished from our lab), affinity-purified rat anti-dHNF4 (Palankeret al., 2009), chicken anti-GFP (Abcam 13970), and mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal (Sigma F3165). We also attempted pre-absorbing the antibodies using purified mitochondria, but this was not sufficient to fully eliminate interference from non-specific bands. Our need for additional approaches to detect dHNF4 protein has been a major motivating factor for developing the new reagents described above that tag all dHNF4 protein isoforms as well as the dHNF4-B isoform.

In addition, we show that the induction of dHNF4 in early adults provides a regulatory mechanism to explain the classic \u201cU-shaped curve\u201d of mitochondrial oxygen consumption in holometabolous insects \u2013 consisting of high respiration rates in larvae, low levels during metamorphosis, and a dramatic increase at the onset of adulthood. Our data supports the model that dHNF4 contributes to establishing the metabolic state of the adult fly by supporting both GSIS and mitochondrial activity. This coupling of developmental progression with metabolic state is a critical regulatory connection that is poorly understood in all animals. In addition, our paper defines a developmental shift in systemic glucose homeostasis and provides new evidence to explain why adult IPCs secrete DILP2 in response to glucose, unlike those of larvae. Finally, it is important to note that this is the first paper to report functional studies of <i>dHNF4</i> in adults.

This will usually be discarded, because of the excess signal at specific nuclear DNA binding sites. In this study, in which the signal to noise ratio in nuclear genes is quite low, any background signal caused by the mtDNA might seem more important. A nice control would have been to perform the ChIP-seq in the mutant flies. The mtDNA signal should be much reduced in the mutants (assuming the mtDNA copy number is the same in mutant flies).</i> The reviewers are correct that the abundance of mtDNA can complicate ChIP-seq peak calling for the mitochondrial genome. Indeed, we were aware of this and thus our analysis of the ChIP-seq data was performed using the MACS2 platform, which addresses this potential artifact by accounting for local differences in read depth across the genome (including the increased abundance of mtDNA relative to nuclear DNA). This program performs peak calling by calculating dynamic Poisson distribution parameters (local lambda values) and thus adjusts for biases due to local differences in abundance compared to the rest of the genome. In effect, this results in peak calling relative to protein binding levels within adjacent flanking sequences of DNA. As a result, we detect specific dHNF4 enrichment that is restricted to a portion of the mtDNA control region and, importantly, this enrichment is not observed in the input control. Although the triple-stranded structure of the D-loop in the control region of mammalian mtDNA has been proposed to contribute to possible false-positive ChIP-seq peaks in mammalian datasets (Marinov et al., 2014), the D-loop structure is not present in <i>Drosophila</i> mtDNA (Rubensteinet al., 1977). Furthermore, the peak for dHNF4 on mtDNA represents the 5<sup>th</sup> strongest enrichment peak in our ChIP-seq dataset out of 68 total. This suggests that its significance is not overemphasized due to low signal, as the high-confidence direct targets for dHNF4 identified from this analysis show robust enrichment for proximal dHNF4 binding. In addition, only select mtDNA genes are underexpressed in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants while mtDNA copy number is unaffected, suggesting a specific regulatory defect in mitochondrial gene expression. Finally, in two other ChIP-seq studies performed in our lab for other nuclear receptors in adult flies using the same protocol, we have not observed such localized enrichment to this predicted mtDNA promoter region. As a result, we feel that specific binding of dHNF4 to mtDNA is a reasonable conclusion from our studies.

In addition, the low viability of <i>dHNF4</i> mutants makes it difficult to get the large quantities of fresh material we need for this experiment (gram quantities of flies).

To what degree can the consequences of dHNF4 depletion be attributed to a reduction of mitochondrial number or mass as opposed to specific TCA cycle and OXPHOS impairment? Does loss of dHNF4 reduce mitochondrial number, mass or mtDNA copy number?</i> This is an important question. We agree that this is a critical experiment, which is now included as <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>. This data shows that there is no significant effect on mitochondrial number as reflected by the ratio of mtDNA:nuclear DNA, the conventional measurement for mitochondrial number. Furthermore, we performed additional metabolomics analysis by GC/MS under conditions where amino acids are restricted from the diet (sucrose fed for 3 days) to limit their ability to replenish TCA cycle intermediates through anapleurotic reactions, providing a more robust approach for identifying changes in TCA cycle intermediates. These studies demonstrate specific defects in the TCA cycle that correlate with the changes in TCA cycle gene expression observed in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants.

We have scanned our list of dHNF4-regulated genes (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) for Drp1 (CG3210), as requested, as well as Opa1 (CG8479), Mfn1/2 (CG3869), Fis1 (CG17510), and Fzo (CG4568). None of these regulators of mitochondrial dynamics, however, are affected by the <i>dHNF4</i> mutation. Rather than being a direct response to the misregulation of a dHNF4 target gene, however, the mitochondrial fragmentation that we observe in <i>dHNF4</i> mutants is more likely due to their overall defects in mitochondrial activity. This association is well established in the literature, as we now discuss in the subsections \u201cdHNF4 acts through multiple tissues and pathways to control glucose homeostasis \u201cand \u201cdHNF4 appears to directly regulate mitochondrial gene expression and function\u201d. Consistent with this, disruption of the electron transport chain via RNAi knockdown of the Complex I assembly factor, <i>CIA30</i>, or knockdown of <i>CG5599</i> (a direct target of dHNF4 that encodes a protein with homology to the E2 subunit of \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase), in the fat body results in mitochondrial fragmentation and hyperglycemia, similar to loss of dHNF4.

This is something that will not be captured by whole-fly approaches, and may in fact prevent identification of some targets. For example, the contribution of the IPCs to total fly chromatin or RNA is likely to be negligible."

For example, the metabolomics data shows that HNF deletion increases glucose-derived metabolites, but the RNA-seq data suggests that glycolytic genes are down-regulated. These data are not incorrect, since the experiments and analysis were done with care and competence, but such analyses are easier to interpret if using a homogeneous extract. The ambiguities introduced by a mixture of tissues with mixed metabolic profiles make it difficult to appreciate the importance of the genomic analyses. The Reviewing Editor does not feel that this issue can be fully solved in a reasonable period of time. So perhaps some initial experiments that address aspects of this issue, and attending to this issue in the Discussion, as a caveat will suffice.</i> The reviewers make the important point that different tissues can respond in different ways to a loss-of-function mutation. Tissue-specific RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and GC/MS metabolomic analysis would address this issue, but they require significant technical effort and financial resources. Rather, we have chosen to address this topic through tissue-specific functional studies of select target genes for dHNF4, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and 5. To address this important topic, we now discuss the caveats involved in interpreting whole-animal genomewide and metabolomic studies in the Discussion, subsection \u201cdHNF4 acts through multiple pathways to regulate glucose homeostasis\u201d, second paragraph."

Consequently, the adult phenotypes described in this manuscript could be adaptive and result from the metabolic alterations caused by dHNF4 loss during larval life (Palanker et al. 2009). The abundance of genes involved in stress and immunity in the RNA-seq dataset is consistent with this idea. The authors should knockdown dHNF4 specifically in the adult (e.g. in tubGal4, tubGal80ts&gt;dHNF4-RNAi flies) and test whether some of the key phenotypes (glucose intolerance, hyperglycemia and GSIS) are still apparent."

Accordingly, we established the recommended <i>tubGal80ts&gt;dHNF4-RNAi</i> stock and tested this extensively in adults. Unfortunately, however, we could not obtain a sufficient reduction in <i>dHNF4</i> expression to result in reproducible phenotypes. As an alternative approach, we have used CRISPR/Cas9 to engineer two FRT sites into introns in the endogenous <i>dHNF4</i> locus in an effort to generate a conditional allele that lacks all <i>dHNF4</i> functions. We believe that this is a better way to conduct this experiment, allowing us to selectively eliminate dHNF4 function in a temporally and spatially regulated manner. We have successfully used this approach to conduct adult-specific functional studies of another nuclear receptor, dERR, in our lab. We thus feel confident that this approach will allow us to perform a comprehensive adult-specific functional analysis in the future. To address this concern of the reviewers, we now discuss this topic in the Discussion (fifth paragraph of the subsection \u201cdHNF4 acts through multiple pathways to regulate glucose homeostasis\u201d), pointing out that developmental functions for dHNF4 could contribute to the phenotypes we observe."

Why did the authors not use the Ilp2-3-Gal4 generated in the Partridge lab, which is confined to late larva/adult IPCS? This would avoid targeting non-IPC dHNF4 expression throughout development.</i> We agree with the reviewers that restricting RNAi against <i>dHNF4</i> to the adult IPCs would be ideal to avoid non-specific effects from such constructs being expressed during larval development. The <i>dilp2-GAL4</i> line we use is recombined into a complex genetic background developed by Seung Kim\u2019s lab to allow for picomolar detection of circulating DILP2 peptide (DILP2HF) upon targeted RNAi in these cells. For details, see our Materials and methods and the paper from the Kim lab (Park et al., 2014). We wanted to ensure that all of our functional studies could be related to the critical phenotype of glucose-stimulated DILP secretion, given that this is a hallmark for MODY1. We thus used this same <i>dilp2-GAL4</i> driver for all functional studies in our paper. Importantly, this line has been validated to drive expression specifically in adult IPCs (Park et al., 2014). In addition, this line includes a <i>UAS-Dcr</i> transgene in the background, which we have found is critical for efficient knockdown in IPCs. Finally, it is important to note that dHNF4 is not detectable in the IPCs during larval stages (Palanker et al., 2009) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), and we express mCherry RNAi for all our studies to control for potential non-specific effects of RNAi in cells lacking an endogenous (or expressed) target mRNA during development."

To show that dHNF4 is really required in adulthood we would like the authors to remove dHNF4 at the onset of adulthood in the whole organism, fat body and IPCs to assess whether the flies become diabetic and whether survival is affected.
