K-fibers are composed of many microtubules that are held together throughout their length. Here, we show, using 3D electron microscopy, that K-fiber microtubules (MTs) are connected by a network of MT connectors. We term this network \u2018the mesh\u2019. The K-fiber mesh is made of linked multipolar connectors. Each connector has up to four struts, so that a single connector can link up to four MTs. Molecular manipulation of the mesh by overexpression of TACC3 causes disorganization of the K-fiber MTs. Optimal stabilization of K-fibers by the mesh is required for normal progression through mitosis. We propose that the mesh stabilizes K-fibers by pulling MTs together and thereby maintaining the integrity of the fiber. Our work thus identifies the K-fiber meshwork of linked multipolar connectors as a key integrator and determinant of K-fiber structure and function."

K-fibers are composed of many microtubules that are held together throughout their length. Here, we show, using 3D electron microscopy, that K-fiber microtubules (MTs) are connected by a network of MT connectors. We term this network \u2018the mesh\u2019. The K-fiber mesh is made of linked multipolar connectors. Each connector has up to four struts, so that a single connector can link up to four MTs. Molecular manipulation of the mesh by overexpression of TACC3 causes disorganization of the K-fiber MTs. Optimal stabilization of K-fibers by the mesh is required for normal progression through mitosis. We propose that the mesh stabilizes K-fibers by pulling MTs together and thereby maintaining the integrity of the fiber. Our work thus identifies the K-fiber meshwork of linked multipolar connectors as a key integrator and determinant of K-fiber structure and function."

It requires the correct assembly of a bipolar array of microtubules (MTs) into a mitotic spindle which, in concert with hundreds of different motors and non-motor proteins, segregates the duplicated sister chromatids to the two daughter cells. Many of the chromosome movements in mitosis are governed by the kinetochore fibers (K-fibers) of the spindle apparatus. In human cells, K-fibers are bundles of 20\u201340 parallel MTs that typically run from the kinetochore to the spindle pole (<a href=\"#bib26\">McDonald et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mastronarde et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">McEwen et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Booth et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sikirzhytski et al., 2014</a>). K-fibers can be thought of as coherent units: their constituent MTs are held together throughout their length, as well as being focused at either end (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rieder, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Spurck et al., 1997</a>). The coherence of the K-fiber is thought to be crucial for accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis. However, the ultrastructural and molecular basis of K-fiber coherence is not well understood."

Classic electron microscopy (EM) studies uncovered the presence of electron density between MTs of the K-fibers (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wilson, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hepler et al., 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Witt et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bastmeyer and Fuge, 1986</a>). These inter-MT bridges appear as bipolar struts laterally connecting two MTs in 2D electron micrographs. The bridges are typically \u223c5 nm thick and range from 6\u201320 nm in length. The morphology of bridges is heterogeneous, and they are likely composed of a variety of proteins (<a href=\"#bib4\">Booth et al., 2011</a>). The mitotic spindle is an ensemble of hundreds of MT-associated proteins (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sauer et al., 2005</a>), some of which are candidates for inter-MT bridges (<a href=\"#bib23\">Manning and Compton, 2008</a>). The number of inter-MT bridges scales with the number of MTs and also with the number of paired MTs in a bundle (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bastmeyer and Fuge, 1986</a>), and it was proposed that it is the inter-MT bridges that hold K-fiber MTs together (<a href=\"#bib47\">Witt et al., 1981</a>). The connection between the kinetochore and K-fiber MTs has been studied by 3D-EM (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">McIntosh et al., 2008</a>).

The morphology of inter-MT bridges is heterogeneous (<a href=\"#bib4\">Booth et al., 2011</a>), as noted in the original report (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hepler et al., 1970</a>). In order to examine the morphology of bridges in more detail, we used electron tomography of sections taken from mitotic HeLa cells fixed by high-pressure freezing/freeze substitution (HPF/FS). This gave a 3D view of the K-fiber MTs and the material that connected them (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Careful examination of the tomograms revealed that inter-MT bridges are not just simple bipolar struts connecting two adjacent MTs: they are interconnected and can contact multiple MTs within the K-fiber. This network of inter-MT connectors is best illustrated by rendering the densities seen in the tomogram and visualizing the resultant computer model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

In contrast, segmentation of non-K-fiber areas resulted in distinct, particulate density and translating MTs to a non-K-fiber area meant that globular density, which passed through the MTs, was detected (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Therefore, there is not a linear relationship between the number of struts in a connector and the connector volume. The volume of mesh within each fiber was, on average, equivalent to the volume of MTs that it encapsulates and larger than the volume of MT walls alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

We found that mesh-MT contacts were highly heterogeneous (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). For example, a crosslink between two MTs could be a simple bipolar strut with a small footprint on both connected MTs, or at the other extreme, the crosslink could be a network of multiple-linked struts, with large mesh contact areas on both MT surfaces. These larger, composite footprints extended for some distance along both linked MTs, but these were not confined to a co-axial line on the MT wall. Moreover, several mesh connectors could contact the same MT at the same axial position (e.g., <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), which further argues that the mesh has no preference for the MT seam."

Moreover, the amount of this complex on K-fibers can be increased simply by overexpressing TACC3 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Booth et al., 2011</a>). In order to experimentally manipulate the mesh, we therefore made a stable inducible HeLa cell line where GFP-TACC3 could be overexpressed in a controlled manner (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The most obvious effect of this manipulation was to alter MT organization. K-fibers in cells expressing GFP-TACC3 had more MTs per fiber, and the cross-sectional area that those MTs occupied was larger, compared to fibers in control uninduced HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

Both analyses showed that <i>local</i> MT packing density within the fiber had increased substantially in TACC3 overexpressing cells compared to uninduced controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), although the fibers themselves were larger overall. A simple manifestation of this tighter local packing was the increased frequency of doublet and triplet MTs within TACC3 overexpressing K-fibers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The median distance to the nearest neighboring MT had decreased from 56.1 to 48.1 nm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), a change in edge-to-edge proximity from 31.1 to 23.1 nm. This means that in TACC3 overexpressing cells, the average nearest neighboring MT is less than the width of one MT away. Because the overexpression of TACC3 alters the MT packing within the K-fiber, these experiments suggested to us that the mesh might influence MT spacing within the K-fiber. We return to the hypothesis that the mesh has an important role in MT spacing below."

To address this question, we used a 3D confocal microscopy assay of tubulin staining in the vicinity of kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cheeseman et al., 2013</a>). In agreement with the EM analysis, we detected a higher tubulin signal in cells expressing GFP-TACC3 compared to those expressing GFP alone. Following cold treatment, the tubulin intensity in the vicinity of kinetochores was reduced to comparable levels in both conditions, suggesting that the additional MTs in TACC3 overexpressing K-fibers are attached by mesh to the rest of the K-fiber but were not stably attached to the kinetochore (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

This corresponds to 9.1 \u00b1 0.01% of the fiber volume in the tomogram, whereas control mesh was 5.7 \u00b1 0.01%. This change is somewhat difficult to interpret because of the significant increase in the number of MTs per fiber and the tighter local packing.

Accordingly, we constructed 2D MT maps, where each MT's chain membership was displayed, and we compared these to the heat maps of local packing as previously described (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The entire dataset was analyzed computationally in order to test the idea that chain membership depended on MT proximity. For each MT, we calculated the number of neighboring MTs within a given search radius and compared these values for single (\u2018unchained\u2019) MTs and those that were part of a chain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This analysis showed that in controls, the single MTs and chained MTs had similar numbers of neighbors, that is, meshed MTs were not more likely to be in tightly packed regions of the fiber. However, in the TACC3 overexpressing fibers, the MTs that were part of a chain had significantly more neighbors than single MTs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), this pattern was seen for search radii &gt;50 nm and was not seen if the dataset was randomized (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, inset, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The closer proximity of chained MTs vs single MTs indicates that the mesh influences MT positioning, effectively pulling them closer together. An alternative possibility is that the mesh is passive and only encapsulates MTs if they are in close proximity. However, this possibility is less likely because MTs in control fibers exhibit no difference in their proximity relative to their chain status."

K-fibers are bundles of parallel MTs, and we sought to characterize how parallel the MTs are and to test if this is altered by TACC3 overexpression. Deviations from parallel would suggest that the mesh tethers MTs closer together and interferes with their trajectory. Qualitatively, we could see that MTs in TACC3 overexpressing K-fibers were more disorganized (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). To measure parallelism more rigorously and to allow comparison of multiple K-fibers, we used several computational approaches (described in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), which allowed us to normalize the 3D trajectory of each fiber and then examine the deviation of MT trajectories from this vector. K-fibers in cells overexpressing TACC3 had a higher proportion of MTs that deviate from parallel. They frequently had significantly larger polar angles compared to MTs in K-fibers from control cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). The deviation of MTs from a completely parallel condition is easier to visualize, by examining the Cartesian intersection coordinates of each MT vector with an x-y plane at a given distance (z) from a common origin (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). These scatter plots show that MTs in TACC3 overexpressing cells deviate further from parallel than those in control cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The fraction of MT vectors intersecting this plane at radial distances of &lt;10 nm from the center is 0.39 and 0.18 in control and TACC3 overexpressing cells, respectively. In other words, there are half as many parallel MTs after TACC3 overexpression."

If they resided towards the periphery of the fiber, they may represent \u2018extra MTs\u2019, perhaps non-kinetochore MTs, that became enmeshed in the fiber when TACC3 was overexpressed. Alternatively, if the deviant MTs are throughout the fiber, this could be evidence for a role of the mesh in influencing MT spacing and packing within the fiber. To assess this, we plotted the polar and azimuthal angles as a function of distance from the K-fiber center (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). These plots show that deviant MTs in TACC3 overexpressing cells are distributed at all distances from the center of the fiber. In controls, there was a weak tendency for deviant MTs to be at the fiber periphery, but the overall extent of trajectory deviancy was lower than in TACC3 overexpressing cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,E</a>). The lack of relation between distance from the fiber center and the deviancy from the fiber trajectory of MTs in fibers from TACC3 overexpressing cells indicates that the mesh plays an influential role in organizing MTs <i>within</i> the fiber. Together our results show that the change in composition of the mesh, caused by TACC3 overexpression, results in tighter local packing of MTs, more interconnectivity and disruption of the parallel organization of MTs within a K-fiber."

To address this question, we used live-cell imaging of our stable inducible cells expressing H2B-mCherry, growing asynchronously and compared mitotic progression in cells, where GFP-TACC3 expression was induced vs not induced. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> shows that TACC3 overexpression increases the time taken for cells to congress all chromosomes to the metaphase plate (prometaphase-to-metaphase). In addition, the time from last chromosome alignment to the onset of anaphase (metaphase-to-anaphase) is also longer (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). No change was seen in the duration of anaphase (anaphase-to-telophase). Interestingly, these changes in mitotic progression are similar to those seen following depletion of TACC3 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cheeseman et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We showed that the mesh is comprised of different connector types and is a major component of the K-fiber. Overexpression of TACC3 alters the mesh and changes the trajectory of MTs within the fiber, indicating that the mesh is a determinant of K-fiber structural integrity. This manipulation causes defects in mitosis and establishes that TACC3 levels at the spindle must be regulated for optimal mitosis."

The importance of inter-MT connections along the length of the K-fiber was demonstrated by severing K-fibers at their midpoint (<a href=\"#bib43\">Spurck et al., 1997</a>). This resulted in two K-fiber stubs attached to the pole and kinetochore. The stubs do not immediately collapse but instead maintain their structural integrity. Our work identifying the mesh suggests that it is the structure that holds MTs together. This makes sense structurally, but there is a possibility that the mesh is passive and simply connects MTs in the fiber, wherever they may be. However, our work points to a role for the mesh in influencing MT position within the K-fiber. The evidence for this is: first, in K-fibers overexpressing TACC3, interconnected MTs are closer together than those not contacted by mesh. Second, a complex containing TACC3 was able to bundle MTs in vitro. Third, mesh in TACC3 overexpressing fibers pulls MTs out of alignment. In this way, the mesh plays an active role in MT positioning in K-fibers by favoring inter-MT interactions of defined distances. An extension of this is that the mesh can actively pull MTs together, in an energy-consuming process. We have no evidence for this intriguing possibility, which is compatible with our findings."

However, it is likely that the mesh is made of other proteins, besides the TACC3\u2013ch-TOG\u2013clathrin complex, for example, CHD4, HURP/DLGAP5, and HSET/KIFC1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mountain et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sharp et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Koffa et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yokoyama et al., 2013</a>). We favor the idea that because we have increased only one component of the mesh experimentally and not others, we do not see uniform changes in spacing and packing. This seems plausible as previous analysis determined TACC3\u2013ch-TOG\u2013clathrin was the shortest crosslinks in K-fibers (<a href=\"#bib4\">Booth et al., 2011</a>), and so an imbalance of connector sizes in the mesh is predicted to skew MT trajectories."

The existence of the matrix has been elusive, although several large macromolecular complexes have been proposed as matrix components (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pickett-Heaps et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ma et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Johansen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Schweizer et al., 2014</a>). Although superficially similar, we do not think that the K-fiber mesh is the ultrastructural correlate of the spindle matrix. The mesh that we have observed exists between MTs within K-fibers (rather than between K-fibers) and is most likely composed of MT-associated proteins that function on K-fiber MTs. Most models of the spindle matrix envisage an elastic milieu that encompasses the entire spindle, yet is independent of the MTs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Scholey et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yao et al., 2012</a>). Despite this, micromanipulation experiments have left open the possibility that an anisotropic matrix could exist along K-fibers (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gatlin et al., 2010</a>), and this would be compatible with our observations. The K-fiber mesh is in agreement with theoretical and experimental work showing that lateral MT connectors are important for MT arrays to sustain physical forces in cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brangwynne et al., 2006</a>)."

Progression through mitosis is slower under these conditions due to problems in chromosome congression and satisfying the spindle assembly checkpoint. Interestingly, a similar phenotype is observed when TACC3 is depleted from the spindle (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Booth et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cheeseman et al., 2013</a>). This indicates that mitosis is sensitive to TACC3 levels. We propose that this sensitivity reflects the robustness of the K-fibers. Too little TACC3\u2013ch-TOG\u2013clathrin and the mesh cannot strengthen the fibers adequately. Too much, and the MTs within the fibers become less parallel and oversupported. Previous work has suggested that hyperstabilization of K-fibers is counter-productive, leading to errors in mitosis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bakhoum et al., 2009</a>). TACC3 levels are altered in several human cancers, for example, ovarian, non-small cell lung cancer, and bladder (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schmidt et al., 2010</a>), and fusions between TACC3 and FGFR3 are reported in glioblastoma and bladder cancer (<a href=\"#bib42\">Singh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Williams et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, the amount of TACC3\u2013ch-TOG\u2013clathrin at the spindle is limited by the availability of phosphorylated TACC3 (<a href=\"#bib18\">LeRoy et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hood et al., 2013</a>), and since Aurora-A kinase is amplified or upregulated in a wide range of cancers (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nikonova et al., 2013</a>), it is possible that hyperstabilization of K-fibers occurs in these cells. Under any of these conditions, erroneous mitosis leading to aneuploidy may contribute to cancer initiation or progression. While we favor the idea that normal mitosis requires optimal K-fiber stabilization by the mesh, it must be noted that TACC3 has at least one additional function in mitosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Guti\u00e9rrez-Caballero et al., 2015</a>), and future work will seek to delineate the role of TACC3 in the mesh vs at the MT plus-ends."

Each MT was rendered individually by hand, and then any 3D density connecting the MTs was automatically detected throughout the volume of the tomogram, using the average gray value of the MTs as an initial threshold for segmentation. The space between MTs in a K-fiber is less granular than the surrounding cytoplasm, which improves mesh detection. This unbiased method superseded our initial attempts at hand-rendering the mesh and allowed for unbiased quantification and visualization of the mesh. Note that measurements are taken from the unsmoothed segmentation maps. The segmentation method detects unbroken density connected to MTs. However, after smoothing for visualization, breaks in the mesh appear. In Amira, MTs were smoothed using unconstrained smoothing, and the mesh was rendered with smooth surface (50 iterations, 0.6 lambda). Hand-rendered mesh in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> was smoothed with constrained smoothing and then smooth surface generated (20 iterations, 0.6 lambda)."

K-fibers are typically in low noise areas of the cytoplasm and this simplifies the detection of mesh associated with K-fiber MTs. Our segmentation method works by detecting density that is connected to MTs. If we break this rule and simply detect in a non-K-fiber region, any density using the same threshold, we pick up particulate material which looks different to the mesh (\u201cnon-mesh\u201d, brown, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2A</a>). Another test we employed early on to give us confidence in mesh detection was to move the segmented MTs to a non-K-fiber area and do the mesh detection. When we do this, we again pick up the particulate density and this amorphous material runs through the lumens of the MTs (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2B</a>). These images support the idea that the mesh is genuine and associated with MTs, although they do not deal with the specificity for K-fibers versus non-kinetochore MTs. Due to the magnification used for imaging, we do not have many tomograms, which feature MTs where we can be certain that they are not part of a K-fiber. Our feeling is that there is density between non-K-fiber MTs but that it is less abundant, since there are fewer MTs running together\u20142-6 MTs interpolar MTs in PtK1 cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mastronarde et al., 1993</a>)\u2014and therefore less interconnectivity of MTs."

These experiments confirmed the \u201cmore MTs per K-fiber\u201d as seen by EM. They also showed that after cold treatment there was a similar amount of tubulin in the vicinity of the kinetochores. This was a very useful piece of information (now added in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). It suggests that the additional MTs seen in K-fibers overexpressing GFP-TACC3 are \u201cpassengers\u201d and are not stably attached to the kinetochore. The assay did not indicate that K-fibers are more stable under conditions of TACC3 over-expression, although to really get at this we would need to challenge the K-fibers with depolymerization (using a range of conditions) at different timepoints during spindle assembly. We have previously shown that clathrin depletion, which also removes the complex from spindles, results in K-fibers that are less stable under cold-treatment conditions (<a href=\"#bib35\">Royle et al., 2005</a>). We also think that further molecular characterization is needed to test what extent the mesh contributes to K-fiber stability."

To answer this, we purified the complex from mitotic spindle fractions using the immunoisolation method that we used to originally identify the complex (<a href=\"#bib4\">Booth et al., 2011</a>). Briefly, clathrin was immunoprecipitated from mitotic cytosol (F1) or spindle fractions (F5-7). TACC3 was only associated with clathrin in the spindle fractions (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 2</a>). These complexes were used for MT bundling experiments. We could see bundling of MTs by clathrin complexes from spindle fraction (F5-7) but not from cytosol (F1). Control anti-myc beads from F1 or F5-7 did not cause bundling (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 2</a>). Since this approach uses untagged proteins, presumably in their native complex, we think this is strong evidence that the complex can bundle MTs in vitro."

In light of this fast exchange, it is perhaps not too surprising that these mesh components do not hang around following MT depolymerization. Finally, related to point 2 above, we are not able to detect mesh in tomograms where there are no MTs, e.g. after depolymerization. This is because our segmentation method works by identifying density that is in contact with MTs. So, while we cannot definitively rule out that the mesh remains after MT depolymerization, we can say that at least this molecular component of the mesh is not resistant to MT depolymerization."
