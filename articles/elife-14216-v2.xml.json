Conserved fission yeast NDR (Nuclear Dbf2-Related) kinase Orb6 governs cell morphogenesis in part by spatially controlling Cdc42 GTPase. Here we describe a novel, independent function for Orb6 kinase in negatively regulating the recruitment of RNA-binding protein Sts5 into RNPs to promote polarized cell growth. We find that Orb6 kinase inhibits Sts5 recruitment into granules, its association with processing (P) bodies, and degradation of Sts5-bound mRNAs by promoting Sts5 interaction with 14-3-3 protein Rad24. Many Sts5-bound mRNAs encode essential factors for polarized cell growth, and Orb6 kinase spatially and temporally controls the extent of Sts5 granule formation. Disruption of this control system affects cell morphology and alters the pattern of polarized cell growth, revealing a role for Orb6 kinase in the spatial control of translational repression that enables normal cell morphogenesis."

Conserved fission yeast NDR (Nuclear Dbf2-Related) kinase Orb6 governs cell morphogenesis in part by spatially controlling Cdc42 GTPase. Here we describe a novel, independent function for Orb6 kinase in negatively regulating the recruitment of RNA-binding protein Sts5 into RNPs to promote polarized cell growth. We find that Orb6 kinase inhibits Sts5 recruitment into granules, its association with processing (P) bodies, and degradation of Sts5-bound mRNAs by promoting Sts5 interaction with 14-3-3 protein Rad24. Many Sts5-bound mRNAs encode essential factors for polarized cell growth, and Orb6 kinase spatially and temporally controls the extent of Sts5 granule formation. Disruption of this control system affects cell morphology and alters the pattern of polarized cell growth, revealing a role for Orb6 kinase in the spatial control of translational repression that enables normal cell morphogenesis."

For example, fission yeast cells maintain their rod-like shape by growing from their ends and then splitting in the middle to produce two new cells of an equal size. Like many other cells, fission yeast often responds to shortages of nutrients or other environmental stressors by growing more slowly or stopping its growth altogether. One way that this stress response is achieved is by preventing certain growth-promoting proteins from being made by storing or degrading the RNA molecules that are needed to make these proteins."

Understanding the conserved mechanisms by which cells tune polarized cell growth has implications for studies of neuronal cell morphogenesis, neurodegenerative diseases, stem cell differentiation, and cancer (<a href=\"#bib116\">Yoshimura et al., 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib92\">Tahirovic and Bradke, 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib112\">Yamashita et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib93\">Tanos and Rodriguez-Boulan, 2008</a>). The fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> is an excellent model system to study cell morphogenesis and growth because cells have a defined cylindrical shape that enables straightforward evaluation of changes in growth and polarity. Under exponential growth conditions, fission yeast cells display a paradigmatic pattern of cell growth, growing in a monopolar fashion during early interphase and activating bipolar growth at the new cell tip once a minimal cell length has been achieved (<a href=\"#bib71\">Mitchison and Nurse, 1985</a>). Further, <i>S. pombe</i> displays a distinct morphological response to nutrient deprivation, which causes cells to divide at a shorter cell length and grow in a monopolar fashion (<a href=\"#bib90\">Su et al., 1996</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib114\">Yanagida, 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib113\">Yanagida et al., 2011</a>)."

In humans, this subset of the AGC kinase group comprises NDR1 and NDR2 and the closely related kinases LATS1 (large tumor suppressor 1) and LATS2 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hergovich et al., 2006</a>), which function downstream of the MST/Hippo kinases (<a href=\"#bib69\">Meng et al., 2016</a>). While LATS1 and LATS2 kinases are central to the Hippo pathway that plays a role in organ size and tumor suppression, dysregulation of NDR kinases has been implicated in cancers such as progressive ductal cell carcinoma, melanoma, non\u2013small-cell lung cancer, and T-cell lymphoma (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adeyinka et al., 2002</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib70\">Millward et al., 1998</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib33\">Hauschild et al., 1999</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib83\">Ross et al., 2000</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib14\">Cornils et al., 2010</a>). In addition to their link to cancer, NDR kinases function also in neuronal growth and differentiation, dendritic branching, and dendritic tiling, and have been implicated in memory and fear conditioning (<a href=\"#bib22\">Emoto et al., 2004</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib117\">Zallen et al., 2000</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib48\">Koike-Kumagai et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib89\">Stork et al., 2004</a>). Recent work has shown that mammalian NDR1 and NDR2 promote polarity in neurons upstream of the polarity protein Par3 (<a href=\"#bib115\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). However, the mechanisms by which NDR kinases control cell growth and polarity are not fully understood. The fission yeast NDR kinase Orb6 is a central component of the conserved morphogenesis (MOR) regulatory network (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hergovich et al., 2006</a>). We previously showed that NDR kinase Orb6 has a role in the establishment of cell polarity and the control of polarized cell growth (<a href=\"#bib100\">Verde et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Verde et al., 1998</a>).

                        "text": "Here, we describe a novel role for Orb6 kinase, genetically separable from its control of the Cdc42 pathway, in promoting polarized cell growth by inhibiting translational repression. Translational repression, carried out in part by the assembly of cytoplasmic granules of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), is a quick and reversible cellular strategy for inhibiting cell growth in response to stress, such as nutritional deprivation, oxidative stress, or osmotic stress (<a href=\"#bib13\">Coller and Parker, 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib19\">Decker and Parker, 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib44\">Kedersha et al., 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib41\">Jud et al., 2008</a>). P-bodies, stress granules, and other RNPs such as neuronal transport granules and germ granules play important roles in mRNA regulation with implications for human diseases such as ALS, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and viral infection (<a href=\"#bib80\">Ramaswami et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib11\">Chahar et al., 2013</a>). P-bodies in particular contain mRNA decay machinery and serve as sites of storage or degradation for mRNAs during times of cellular stress (<a href=\"#bib19\">Decker and Parker, 2012</a>). In this work, we describe a novel mechanism whereby NDR kinase Orb6 negatively regulates the recruitment of mRNA-binding protein Sts5 into RNP particles and Sts5 localization to P-bodies at least in part by promoting Sts5 interaction with 14-3-3 protein Rad24. This mechanism of control prevents the degradation of mRNAs encoding proteins important for polarized cell growth and cell morphogenesis during exponential cell growth, and promotes morphological adaptation during nutritional stress."

Many of these puncta colocalize with P-body (Processing body) marker Dcp1-mCherry, a component of the mRNA decapping complex (<a href=\"#bib103\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Sts5 localization to the P-bodies is particularly strong during glucose deprivation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,b,h</a>) and occurs also during nitrogen starvation, although puncta appear smaller and co-localization of Sts5 with Dcp1 is partial (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,c,i</a>). Conversely, Sts5 recruitment into puncta during mitosis occurs in the absence of substantial P-body formation, as visualized with P-body marker Dcp1-mCherry (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Consistent with these findings, Sts5 contains a region predicted to be intrinsically disordered in the first 301 amino acids of the Sts5 protein, a feature shared by many proteins that undergo assembly into RNP particles (<a href=\"#bib58\">Lin et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib77\">Patel et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib21\">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib104\">Wang et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">Kato et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Han et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We consistently found an increase in the number and intensity of Sts5 puncta at the non-growing end of smaller cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,d,e\u00a0and\u00a0f</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), indicating an inverse correlation between Orb6 kinase localization at the growing tip and Sts5 aggregation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>)."

SIN signaling remains active until completion of cytokinesis, which is marked by closure of the contractile ring and a fully formed cell septum (<a href=\"#bib26\">Garc\u00eda-Cort\u00e9s and McCollum, 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib2\">Alcaide-Gavil\u00e1n et al., 2014</a>).

The derepression of MOR signaling, and of Orb6 activity, that results from inactivation of the SIN pathway promotes cell separation upon completion of cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gupta et al., 2014</a>). Consistent with Orb6 kinase re-activation, Sts5-3xGFP puncta dissipate when the septum is fully closed and the actomyosin contractile ring protein Rlc1, encoding myosin II regulatory light chain (<a href=\"#bib54\">Le Goff et al., 2000</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib110\">Wu et al., 2006</a>), disappears from the plane of cell division (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G,H</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib106\">Wei et al., 2016</a>).

In humans, hDis3L2 is of particular interest because it has been implicated in the congenital Perlman syndrome, which confers fetal overgrowth and susceptibility to Wilms tumor (<a href=\"#bib3\">Astuti et al., 2012</a>). Whereas Sts5 lacks crucial amino acids required for exonuclease activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Malecki et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib98\">Uesono et al., 1997</a>), our work shows that Sts5 promotes mRNA degradation likely by promoting the interaction of Sts5-associated transcripts with P-body components. Similar to Sts5, Dis3L2 also localizes to P-bodies (<a href=\"#bib61\">Malecki et al., 2013</a>), as well as the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> homologue of Sts5, Ssd1 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Jansen et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib52\">Kurischko et al., 2011</a>). These findings suggest that, differently from the related exonuclease Dis3 (<a href=\"#bib82\">Robinson et al., 2015</a>), this group of RNA-binding proteins employs a mechanism of mRNA degradation that does not involve interaction with the exosome. However, it is likely that Sts5 and Dis3L2 have different roles in P-body assembly and/or recruitment of mRNAs to P-bodies. Indeed, deletion of the <i>sts5</i> homologue <i>dis3L2</i> does not suppress the growth defect observed upon Orb6-as2 kinase inhibition (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>C. albicans</i>, Sts5 homologue Ssd1, with roles in cell wall hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Jansen et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib105\">Wanless et al., 2014</a>), fertility (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bourens et al., 2009</a>), and transcription (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lee et al., 2015</a>), has been proposed to promote localized mRNA translation because of its enrichment at the bud site (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kurischko et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0Lee et al., 2015). We have not observed enrichment of Sts5 at the sites of polarized growth in <i>S. pombe</i> cells, which may employ a different strategy for ensuring adequate mRNA localization in daughter cells."

                        "text": "Our work indicates that Sts5 may function as a seed for P-body formation under stress and upon Orb6 kinase inhibition. P-bodies and similar RNPs have been shown to have liquid properties and their formation has been described as condensation by a phase-separation mechanism once P-body components reach critical concentrations (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kroschwald et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib58\">Lin et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib21\">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib39\">Hyman et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib7\">Brangwynne et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib55\">Lee et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib8\">Brangwynne, 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib4\">Becker and Gitler, 2015</a>). It has been proposed that mRNA-binding proteins may play a role in the aggregation of mRNPs into larger structures, especially proteins containing intrinsically disordered domains, which have the potential to promote phase separation by forming multiple weak protein-protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib58\">Lin et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib77\">Patel et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib21\">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib104\">Wang et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">Kato et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Han et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib62\">Malinovska et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib97\">Toretsky and Wright, 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib51\">Kroschwald et al., 2015</a>). Thus, Sts5 may have the ability to function in mRNP granule formation through interactions with other P-body proteins, and one function of Orb6 phosphorylation may be to limit Sts5 recuitment to prevent inappropriate seeding of P-bodies. Consistent with this idea, Sts5 displays a predicted disordered domain at the N-terminus, which is phosphorylated <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kettenbach et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib10\">Carpy et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib47\">Koch et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib108\">Wilson-Grady et al., 2008</a>). Future experiments will address how phosphorylation of this domain modulates the function of Sts5 and affects its properties <i>in vitro</i>."

The mechanisms that modulate cell morphogenesis and polarized cell growth in response to varying growth and environmental conditions are still poorly understood. We find that <i>sts5\u0394</i> mutants delay the adaptation to starvation conditions, maintaining bipolar growth and a longer cell length as cell density increases and the medium becomes depleted of nutrients. This effect appears to be further exacerbated at higher temperatures (36\u00b0C), where <i>sts5\u0394</i> cells become enlarged and bloated, with increased protein levels of the CAMKK Ssp1. Our findings indicate that <i>sts5\u0394</i> mutants have defects in adapting to nutrient deprivation or temperature increase, and fail to manifest the appropriate morphological response to varying extracellular conditions. Thus Sts5 may integrate diverse nutritional and environmental signals to coordinate changes to the pattern of cell growth."

Future research will seek to identify nutrient-sensitive signaling pathways upstream of Orb6 and define the specific roles of Orb6 kinase and Sts5 in the control of P-body assembly. Due to the conservation of these factors, this work has the potential to open new avenues of research linking nutrient-sensitive signaling and P-body regulation with implications for studies of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases."

Cells were pelleted (taking care to spin cells at \u2264500 rpm for 3\u20135 min between washes in steps after the Zymolyase digestion) then washed in buffer B.

For threshold selection, we adapted a method similar to one previously described for image threshold selection of RNA FISH images (<a href=\"#bib79\">Raj et al., 2008</a>).

The major weakness is insufficient characterization of mRNA interactions with Sts5, demonstration of spatial redistribution of these mRNAs to P-bodies, and correlation with changes in mRNA stability. These concerns, in addition to those elaborated by the reviewers below, would require more extensive additional work than we typically allow for in a revision.

Many of the protein constituents of SGs and P-bodies contain domains resembling yeast prions (called prion-like domains or low-complexity domains). These domains afford the protein a remarkable ability to undergo phase transitions. There has been an emergence of interest in this phenomenon since it has broad implications on gene regulation and many other facets of biology."

They show that the fission yeast protein Sts5 forms RNA granule like accumulations during mitosis and this is negatively regulated by a kinase, Orb6. Remarkably, the aggregation of Sts5 serves to sequester certain key polarized growth protein encoding mRNAs. This is a novel example of how regulated aggregation can be harnessed by cell biology to regulate a fundamental biological process."

Sts5 loss of function leads to increased levels of these and other mRNAs, indicating Ssp5 promotes mRNA degradation. They propose that Orb6 phosphorylation of Sts5 promotes its association of 14-3-3 to antagonize its association with P-bodies, thus preventing the degradation of key mRNA for polarized growth. They further propose that this regulation is spatially regulated, with Sts5 aggregates forming preferentially at the non-growing cell end of monopolar cells; and temporally regulated, with Orb6-mediated inhibition taking place during mitosis and cytokinesis but being relieved upon contractile ring closure."
