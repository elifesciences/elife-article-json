The structure of the ATG14-containing PI3KC3-C1 was determined by single-particle EM, revealing a V-shaped architecture. All of the ordered domains of VPS34, VPS15, and BECN1 were mapped by MBP tagging. The dynamics of the complex were defined using hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange, revealing a novel 20-residue ordered region C-terminal to the VPS34 C2 domain. VPS15 organizes the complex and serves as a bridge between VPS34 and the ATG14:BECN1 subcomplex. Dynamic transitions occur in which the lipid kinase domain is ejected from the complex and VPS15 pivots at the base of the V. The N-terminus of BECN1, the target for signaling inputs, resides near the pivot point. These observations provide a framework for understanding the allosteric regulation of lipid kinase activity."

The structure of the ATG14-containing PI3KC3-C1 was determined by single-particle EM, revealing a V-shaped architecture. All of the ordered domains of VPS34, VPS15, and BECN1 were mapped by MBP tagging. The dynamics of the complex were defined using hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange, revealing a novel 20-residue ordered region C-terminal to the VPS34 C2 domain. VPS15 organizes the complex and serves as a bridge between VPS34 and the ATG14:BECN1 subcomplex. Dynamic transitions occur in which the lipid kinase domain is ejected from the complex and VPS15 pivots at the base of the V. The N-terminus of BECN1, the target for signaling inputs, resides near the pivot point. These observations provide a framework for understanding the allosteric regulation of lipid kinase activity."

The most ancient role for autophagy is surviving during starvation. Bulk cytosol is captured in a growing double membrane structure termed the phagophore. Upon sealing, the resulting double membrane vesicle is known as an autophagosome. The autophagosome fuses with the lysosome or vacuole, resulting in the degradation of its contents and the recycling of biosynthetic precursors by export across the lysosomal membrane. In higher eukaryotes, autophagy has acquired many additional roles in cellular protection. For example, the core autophagy protein BECN1 (Beclin 1) is a tumor suppressor. <i>BECN1</i> is deleted in 40\u201375% of human breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liang et al., 1999</a>). Autophagy is also thought, under most conditions, to protect cells from the accumulation of pathogenic inclusions that can lead to Huntington's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rubinsztein et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Nixon, 2013</a>)."

Class III PI3Ks synthesize phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) from phosphatidylinositol (PI), as compared to the class I and II PI3Ks that generate PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, respectively (<a href=\"#bib2\">Backer, 2008</a>). In yeast, where the complex was first characterized, there are two PI 3-kinase complexes, known as complexes I and II, with clear-cut distinctions in their functions (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kihara et al., 2001</a>). Both yeast complexes contain the core subunits Vps34, Vps15, and Atg6. Vps34 contains the catalytic domain responsible for lipid kinase activity, as well as a putative lipid-binding C2 domain and a helical domain (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schu et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Miller et al., 2010</a>). Vps15 is a large (150 kDa) protein essential for the activity of the complex (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stack et al., 1993</a>). Vps15 contains a protein kinase domain whose function and possible substrates are uncertain, as well as HEAT and WD40 repeats. Atg6 is the yeast ortholog of the human tumor suppressor BECN1 and contains an intrinsically disordered region, a coiled coil, and a BARA domain. Yeast complex I further contains the coiled coil subunit Atg14 and is the complex that is involved in autophagy initiation. Yeast complex II contains instead another coiled coil protein, Vps38, and functions in endosome maturation."

PI3KC3-C2 has been proposed to function at later stages in autophagy (<a href=\"#bib26\">Liang et al., 2006</a>) but is not currently thought to participate in the initiation of autophagosome biogenesis. The overall objective of this study was to define the architecture of the two human PI3KC3 complexes.

Structures of homologs of the Vps34 C2 domain and the Vps15 HEAT repeats and protein kinase domains are available.

We have mapped the positions of the various domains of the subunits by tagging with maltose binding protein (MBP). Insight into large-scale conformational fluctuations of PI3KC3-C1 was obtained from EM, while local dynamics was mapped by hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange. Taken together, the data led us to a model for the subunit architecture and dynamics of PI3KC3-C1. The main architectural principles also hold for the PI3KC3-C2 complex. The structural model suggests that the VPS15 kinase domain acts as a latch to regulate PI 3-kinase activity in both the PI3KC3-C1 and -C2."

The remaining large density features were assigned to VPS15, beginning with the N-terminally tagged kinase domain. A homology model for the VPS15 kinase catalytic domain was derived from the structure of protein kinase A (PKA) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Knighton et al., 1991</a>). The model was docked into a major density feature adjoining the position of the tag and matching its size and shape (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B and 5C</a>). A model for the 498-residue HEAT repeat domain of VPS15 was generated by threading the corresponding sequence onto the backbone of the HEAT repeat portion of the exportin subunit Cse1 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Matsuura and Stewart, 2004</a>) and provided an excellent match to the arch-shaped density adjoining the C-terminus of the VPS15 kinase domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B and 5C</a>). Indeed, the kinase and HEAT repeat domains of VPS15 seem to be fused into a single contiguous unit. The most C-terminal domain of VPS15, the WD40 propeller region, is connected to the HEAT by a 180-residue linker. This propeller was assigned to the last unaccounted for density feature, located next to the BECN1 BARA domain, which has a donut-like shape that matches the crystal structure of the yeast Vps15 propeller domain (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heenan et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B and 5C</a>). Collectively, the docked or assigned regions of the VPS34 C2 and HELCAT, VPS15 kinase, HEAT, and WD40, BECN1 BARA domains account for 2162 residues of the 3187 present in ATG14\u2013PI3KC3."

One tube is adjacent to the VPS15 WD40 domain. It points towards the BECN1 BARA domain at one end and towards the second tube at the other. Following a gap in the density between the two tubes, the second one continues until it merges with the density for the VPS15 HEAT domains. The BARA domain marks the C-terminus of the BECN1 coiled-coil, and MBP marks the N-termini of ATG14 and BECN1 coils, so we assigned this region to the coiled coil dimer. Because there is a break between the two tubular regions and the BARA density, we did not build an explicit molecular model of this region. One of the few unassigned density features projects away from the VPS15 HEAT domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>), very near the MBP markers for the N-termini of ATG14 and BECN1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This suggests that at least parts of the N-termini of one or both of these subunits have some ordered structure.

UVRAG is larger than ATG14 and contains a unique N-terminal C2 domain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In order to gain insight into the structural basis for the differences in localization and function between the two complexes, PI3KC3-C2 was expressed, purified, assayed, and prepared for EM imaging (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) using the same procedures as for PI3KC3-C1. 2D class averages of this complex show the same characteristic V-morphology and preferential face-on orientations as seen for PI3KC3-C1. As for PI3KC3-C1, the majority of particles belonged to classes in which the VPS34 HELCAT domain was dislodged from the rest of the complex. The main difference in the images is the consistent presence of additional density at the base of the V (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, arrows). The location of the density corresponds to the expected location of the UVRAG C2 domain. The main conclusion from the 2D characterization of the PI3KC3-C2 is that the overall conformation and architecture are essentially identical to that of the PI3KC3-C1 as seen at the present resolution of our analysis. Therefore, the functional differences between the two complexes cannot be attributed to gross differences in architecture or conformation."

In order to characterize these structurally undefined regions, we carried out hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange (HDX) as detected by mass spectrometry (MS) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Englander, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Engen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chalmers et al., 2011</a>). Excellent peptide coverage was obtained for all of VPS15 (167 peptides were analyzed, 89.9% protein coverage) and all of VPS34 (119 peptides were analyzed, 74.7% protein coverage) with the exception of the C2 domain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Throughout the ordered domains of VPS15 and VPS34, partial exchange was observed, consistent with the folded nature of the domains (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Complete exchange was observed throughout the VPS15 HEAT-WD40 linker at incubation times as short as 10 s (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), indicating that this region is essentially completely flexible and intrinsically disordered. The linker between the helical and kinase domains of VPS34 also manifested complete exchange, consistent with the absence of density for this region in the VPS34 crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib34\">Miller et al., 2010</a>)."

The HDX-MS experiments together with the EM analysis highlight the dynamic nature of the complex. At the available resolution, the overall architecture is essentially the same for PI3KC3-C2 and PI3KC3-C1. The reconstruction thus provides a unified model for VPS34 complex organization. The overall structure allows us to rationalize a variety of previous data on subunit organization. The BARA domain of BECN1 is essential for the incorporation of BECN1 into the PI3KC3-C1 complex (<a href=\"#bib11\">Furuya et al., 2005</a>), consistent with its interactions with the VPS15 WD40 domain in the EM structure. Similarly, the ATG14 coiled coil region is essential for its association with VPS34 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Itakura et al., 2008</a>), consistent with the interactions of both the ATG14 coiled coil and VPS34 with the central VPS15 scaffold. The C2 domain of VPS34 was previously shown to be the main locus for the incorporation of VPS34 into the complex (<a href=\"#bib26\">Liang et al., 2006</a>). This fits with the structural observation that VPS34-C2 is integral to the core architecture, while the C-terminal HELCAT region is readily dislodged. An interaction was reported between the C-terminal helix of VPS34 and the VPS15 kinase-HEAT region (<a href=\"#bib4\">Budovskaya et al., 2002</a>), consistent with the contacts we observed between the kinase domains of VPS15 and VPS34. The C-terminal helix of VPS34 is critically involved in membrane interaction upon activation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Miller et al., 2010</a>), and this raises the interesting speculation that VPS34 could be regulated via inter-subunit sequestration of the same helix. The congruence of the size and shape of density features with subunit domains, the connectivity of the domains within VPS34 and VPS15, the localization of the tags, and the consistency with published interactions all lend high confidence to our structural assignments and the defined architecture of the complex."

Many of these class averages show that VPS34-HELCAT is dislodged from the rest of the complex, even though the rest of the complex is intact. The class averages also provide some insight into the nature of the motions. It should be emphasized that, while there is evidence for domain movements, the exact extent and direction of the movements are unknown. The range of movements may be constrained in our experiments by the presence of the carbon film on which the complex is imaged. Thus, the movements noted here may be a subset of the range that could occur in solution. VPS34-HELCAT makes contacts principally with the kinase domain of VPS15. In many of the class averages, the VPS15 kinase domain pivots toward the other arm of the V. The pivoting motion includes the VPS15 HEAT repeat domain. Thus the VPS15 kinase and HEAT regions function as a single module. By analogy to the HELCAT terminology for VPS34, we refer to it as the KINHEAT module. VPS15 is not obviously a pseudokinase on the basis of its sequence (<a href=\"#bib57\">Taylor et al., 2013</a>), yet there is no compelling evidence that VPS15 can phosphorylate substrates (<a href=\"#bib2\">Backer, 2008</a>). The VPS15-KINHEAT physically contacts the VPS34-HELCAT region, which suggests that regulation could occur through direct and stable interactions without covalent phosphorylation."

The HDX data show that the VPS15 HEAT-WD40 linker is essentially completely disordered, yet the WD40 domain is firmly lodged in the complex in all class averages. The WD40 is thus clearly not undergoing tethered diffusion or \u2018fly-casting\u2019 in the context of the assembled complex. The only part of the structure that we observed to undergo fly-casting is the VPS34 HELCAT module. Even in this case, the motions are constrained. Although the linker between the VPS34 C2 and helical domains spans 130 residues, the presence of the anchored CHIL domain in the center of this linker sharply restricts the range of motion. There are \u223c50\u201365 residues between the CHIL and the boundaries of the nearest ordered modules, which would limit the maximum reach of the fully extended linker to \u223c20 nm. This is consistent with the maximum 18 nm displacement of the HELCAT region seen in EM images."

VPS15 is capable of pivoting about the KINHEAT-WD40 junction. The base of the V is mainly formed from the HEAT repeats of VPS15.

This region is subject to activating phosphorylations by the upstream autophagy initiating kinase ULK1 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Russell et al., 2013</a>) and the AMP-activated kinase AMPK (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). The BECN1 BH3 domain responsible for binding to Bcl-2, which inhibits autophagy, is located in this region (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pattingre et al., 2005</a>). Along the same lines, a Cys-rich region of ATG14 immediately N-terminal to the coiled coil has been proposed to be the site of ER targeting (<a href=\"#bib31\">Matsunaga et al., 2010</a>). Thus, this region of the PI3KC3-C1 structure might act as an allosteric reporter for localization to the ER membrane. It is tempting to speculate that the right arm of the complex transmits signals from the region of the BECN1 N-terminus to the VPS34 lipid kinase domain. It is exciting to finally have a structural context in which to test how the many signals that impinge on BECN1 and PI3KC3-C1 are processed."

Template-based automated particle picking was performed using the FindEM program (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roseman, 2004</a>). The contrast transfer functions (CTFs) of the micrographs were estimated using the CTFFIND for untilted images and CTFTILT for tilted images (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003</a>).

Briefly, 23 tilt-pair images yielded an initial dataset of 12,027 tilt-pair particles. The untilted particles were aligned and classified in 2D using reference-free classification and MRA as described above, followed by a single round of 2D reference-based alignment using Spider's AP MQ command (<a href=\"#bib9\">Frank et al., 1996</a>). The final 14 classes ranged from 725 to 1198 untilted particles each and class-volumes were calculated from the matching tilted particles by backprojection. The class-volumes were then refined against the entire dataset (both tilted and untilted) using an iterative projection matching procedure combining SPARX and EMAN2 libraries (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baldwin and Penczek, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tang et al., 2007</a>). Each class-volume that corresponded to the whole complex converged to the same 3D reconstruction (with a final resolution of 27\u201330 \u00c5, according to the FSC at 0.5 cutoff criterion). This map was used as the starting model for all subsequent structure refinements. Structure refinement was performed using images acquired at 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, and 45\u00b0. The initial particle selection gave 109,776 particles at 0\u00b0, 24,085 at 30\u00b0, and 25,694 at 45\u00b0. Reference-free 2D class averages were calculated as described above, with images recorded at different tilt angles treated separately to allow assessment of tilt-dependent orientations and image quality. Initial attempts to perform 3D classification using RELION (<a href=\"#bib49\">Scheres, 2012</a>) with respect to the position on the VPS34 HELCAT region did not result in robust 3D classes. Thus, particles belonging to class averages of lower resolution, as well as class averages with a dislodged VPS34 HELCAT region, were excluded from further processing. This resulted in a dataset of 24,116 particles at 0\u00b0, 8643 at 30\u00b0, and 5986 at 45\u00b0. The final structure (deposited at EMDB with accession number 2846) was calculated using a single 3D class in RELION (<a href=\"#bib49\">Scheres, 2012</a>), with the main RCT structure low-pass filtered to 80 \u00c5 as initial reference. The distribution of Euler angles assigned by RELION was visualized with UCSF Chimera (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). The structure had a resolution of 28 \u00c5 according to the gold standard FSC criterion as implemented in RELION and was used for docking of homology models of domains. The density map was further validated by tilt-pair analysis (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>) with image pairs collected at 0\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 using software made available by John Rubinstein (U Toronto). As a control for the tilt-pair analysis, image pairs were collected on negatively stained <i>Escherichia coli</i> 70S ribosomes under identical conditions, co-mapping them to a published 70S ribosome map (EMDB 1849) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agirrezabala et al., 2011</a>)."

In other class averages, the HEAT-repeat and kinase domain portion of Vps34 is dislodged/separated from the rest of the complex and VPS15 pivots at its position at the base of the V. The authors interpret these changes either as the complex falling apart (this happens to lots of complexes on an EM grid) or else, and this model is very extensively developed, flexibility indicating allosteric communication via the VPS15 HEAT repeat domain.
