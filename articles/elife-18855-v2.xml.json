In exploring how <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> acquires its microbiome, we found that a microbial community influences <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory and egg-laying behaviors differently than individual members. <i>Drosophila</i> prefers a <i>Saccharomyces</i>-<i>Acetobacter</i> co-culture to the same microorganisms grown individually and then mixed, a response mainly due to the conserved olfactory receptor, <i>Or42b. Acetobacter</i> metabolism of <i>Saccharomyces-</i>derived ethanol was necessary, and acetate and its metabolic derivatives were sufficient, for co-culture preference. Preference correlated with three emergent co-culture properties: ethanol catabolism, a distinct volatile profile, and yeast population decline. Egg-laying preference provided a context-dependent fitness benefit to larvae. We describe a molecular mechanism by which a microbial community affects animal behavior. Our results support a model whereby emergent metabolites signal a beneficial multispecies microbiome."

In exploring how <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> acquires its microbiome, we found that a microbial community influences <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory and egg-laying behaviors differently than individual members. <i>Drosophila</i> prefers a <i>Saccharomyces</i>-<i>Acetobacter</i> co-culture to the same microorganisms grown individually and then mixed, a response mainly due to the conserved olfactory receptor, <i>Or42b. Acetobacter</i> metabolism of <i>Saccharomyces-</i>derived ethanol was necessary, and acetate and its metabolic derivatives were sufficient, for co-culture preference. Preference correlated with three emergent co-culture properties: ethanol catabolism, a distinct volatile profile, and yeast population decline. Egg-laying preference provided a context-dependent fitness benefit to larvae. We describe a molecular mechanism by which a microbial community affects animal behavior. Our results support a model whereby emergent metabolites signal a beneficial multispecies microbiome."

When the strains were grown individually, <i>Drosophila</i> was strongly attracted to yeasts, moderately attracted to acetic acid bacteria, and neutral or slightly repelled by lactic acid bacteria (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Because strains within a microbial group attracted <i>Drosophila</i> similarly, a representative yeast, acetic acid bacterium, and lactic acid bacterium were used to test the effect of interactions between microbiome members on <i>Drosophila</i> behavior. <i>Drosophila</i> preferred microbial communities grown together to microorganisms grown individually and then mixed prior to analysis (defined throughout as a separate-culture mixture, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Focusing on a model <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Acetobacter malorum</i> community, we found that when tested against apple juice medium (AJM), <i>Drosophila</i> attraction to the community was stronger than to the separate-culture mixture or individual members (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In sum, <i>Drosophila</i> detects, and prefers, microorganisms growing together to a mixture of the same strains combined after they had completed growth."

In this study, we found that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> produced low quantities of esters when grown alone.

However, in low nitrogen environments <i>Acetobacter</i> may be responsible for ester production and <i>Drosophila</i> attraction; <i>Acetobacter</i> may be capable of producing esters in low nitrogen conditions or may generate locally high nitrogen environments by assimilating nitrogen from yeast killed by its production of acetic acid.

As such, the lysis of viable yeast by <i>Acetobacter</i> may benefit <i>Drosophila</i> through the liberation of nutrients.

Ethanol can have deleterious or beneficial fitness consequences for <i>Drosophila</i> depending on concentration (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ranganathan et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Azanchi et al., 2013</a>) and ecological context (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kacsoh et al., 2013</a>). Our results are consistent with <i>Drosophila</i> using products of inter-species microbiome metabolism to detect a community that titrates ethanol concentration optimally for the host. Work that further dissects the consequences of acetic acid and ethanol concentrations on <i>Drosophila</i> biology and investigates other community-level metabolic profiles will be of interest to enrich the chemical and ecological portrait of the <i>Drosophila</i> microbiome."

On the one hand, we observed that juice agar plates inoculated with the co-culture containing <i>A. pomorum</i> WT had fewer viable yeast cells and larvae developed more slowly, likely due to the lower vital nutrients (e.g. protein, vitamins) than would be available in the co-culture containing <i>A. pomorum adhA</i>. On the other hand, when exposed to environmental microbes, juice agar plates inoculated with the co-culture containing <i>A. pomorum</i> WT were not invaded by fungi, whereas the co-culture containing <i>A. pomorum adhA</i> was susceptible to fungal growth. This suggests that in more natural conditions the catabolism of ethanol into acetic acid, which delays larval development in the microbial community studied here (e.g. in a community with <i>S. cerevisiae</i>), ultimately has a protective effect. Whether this is due to a direct elimination of pathogens or instead indirectly limits fungal competition, as has been shown for dietary yeasts and <i>Aspergillus</i> sp. (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rohlfs and K\u00fcrschner, 2010</a>) is unknown.

Other work suggests that <i>Drosophila</i> acquires its adult microbiome from exogenous sources, that adult microbiome abundance drops without continuous ingestion of exogenous microorganisms, and that the microbiome can be shaped by diet (<a href=\"#bib19\">Chandler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Blum et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Broderick et al., 2014</a>). As such, a combination of internal mechanisms, exogenous factors, and host behavior likely sculpt the microbiome; determining the relative contribution of each will be important moving forward. Complicating our understanding of the contribution of these factors is the opaque distinction between \u2018microbiome\u2019 and \u2018food\u2019, since both are ingested from the environment (<a href=\"#bib14\">Broderick, 2016</a>). To dissect the formation and stability of the <i>Drosophila</i> microbiome, the fate of ingested microorganisms needs to be monitored and microbial intestinal replication needs to be surveyed as a function of <i>Drosophila</i> behavior, age, immune status, microbiome membership, and nutritional state [e.g. using synthetic diets without yeast; (<a href=\"#bib60\">Shin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Piper et al., 2014</a>)]."

The authors show that a co-culture of yeast and bacteria (<i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>A. malorum</i>) grown together is more attractive than when the two cultures are mixed before testing. Attraction is reduced in Or42b and OrCo mutants with olfactory defects. Ethanol reduction and acetic acid production are unique to the co-culture. The preference toward the co-culture can largely be explained by acetic acid and esters production. The general point \u2013 that microbes interact with each other to affect the culture they are growing in, and that this in turn affects the way the culture is perceived by other organisms \u2013 is almost certainly true, and is interesting and important. We think that this study is of interest to the broad readership of <i>eLife</i> and support the publication of a streamlined and improved version which addresses the major points raised."

Adults can come in and lay eggs and then leave (as they often do) \u2013 eggs and larvae don't have that option. And as the authors point out here, cultures like this are not stable. If selection has indeed driven flies to choose ideal ethanol and acetic acid concentrations, then the flies should be selecting egg laying conditions that will be good for eggs and larvae over the coming days, not those that are good for adults at that exact concentration."
