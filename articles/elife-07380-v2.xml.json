Secretins are major components of type II and III secretion systems and are linked to extrusion of type IV pili (T4P) and to DNA uptake. By electron cryo-tomography of whole <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> cells, we determined the <i>in situ</i> structure of a T4P molecular machine in the open and the closed state. Comparison reveals a major conformational change whereby the N-terminal domains of the central secretin PilQ shift by \u223c30 \u00c5, and two periplasmic gates open to make way for pilus extrusion. Furthermore, we determine the structure of the assembled pilus."

Secretins are major components of type II and III secretion systems and are linked to extrusion of type IV pili (T4P) and to DNA uptake. By electron cryo-tomography of whole <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> cells, we determined the <i>in situ</i> structure of a T4P molecular machine in the open and the closed state. Comparison reveals a major conformational change whereby the N-terminal domains of the central secretin PilQ shift by \u223c30 \u00c5, and two periplasmic gates open to make way for pilus extrusion. Furthermore, we determine the structure of the assembled pilus."

T4P are grouped together in a class based on the production and secretion of the major pilin protein PilA4 (<i>Thermus</i> nomenclature), thousands of copies of which form the helical pilus (<a href=\"#bib13\">Craig et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schwarzenlander et al., 2009</a>). The T4P is the only known bacterial pilus that can be retracted rapidly (<a href=\"#bib33\">Maier et al., 2004</a>) to enable motility and adherence (<a href=\"#bib36\">Merz et al., 2000</a>), major contributors to bacterial virulence (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hahn, 1997</a>).

To date, there is no information on the <i>in situ</i> structure of either the T4P machinery or DNA translocator. Determining structures of T4P complexes in whole bacterial cells is therefore of paramount importance and will enable further study of bacterial resistance and disease. Electron cryo-tomography (cryoET) has the unique ability to determine protein structures in cells at molecular resolution. We have applied cryoET to whole <i>T. thermophilus</i> HB27 cells, in order to visualize the T4P machinery <i>in situ</i>. We determine the helical structure of the pilus and find that the secretin complex PilQ is a central dynamic component of this system. CryoET and subtomogram averaging of the T4P machinery with and without pili reveal a \u223c30 \u00c5 conformational change as the gates in the complex open."

We compared a 2D projection of the channel part of the subtomogram average with projections of purified, negatively stained PilQ only (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burkhardt et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, central and right panels). PilQ was seen to consist of a C-terminal trapezoid \u2018cone structure\u2019 with staggered rings in the N-terminal domain (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burkhardt et al., 2011</a>), in excellent agreement with our <i>in situ</i> structure. Moreover, the new cryoET structure shows additional protein densities extending from the putative N0 domain of PilQ through the peptidoglycan layer (P1 and P2) to the cytoplasmic membrane (C1) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Candidate proteins include PilW, which is associated with the inner and outer membranes and is essential for the outer membrane localization of PilQ (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rumszauer et al., 2006</a>), and PilO/PilN heterodimers that could connect PilQ to the ATPases by PilM in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib25\">Karuppiah and Derrick, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Karuppiah et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). These proteins are most likely connected to one another by flexible domains that are not well contrasted in the subtomogram average. A longitudinal slice through the complex reveals that PilQ has two gates, which are closed in the absence of a pilus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, left panel and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, right panel). Gate 1 is formed by the \u2018cone\u2019 in the outer membrane and gate 2 by the N1 domain at the base of PilQ, enclosing an empty periplasmic vestibule (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, right panel). The C-terminal \u2018cone\u2019 has been shown to form a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-stable sub-domain (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burkhardt et al., 2011</a>), thus, it is plausible that gate 1 is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the cell membrane in the closed state. A second gate formed by the N-terminal domains has not been observed in other secretins (<a href=\"#bib28\">Korotkov et al., 2011</a>). The N-terminus of PilQ forms an unusual \u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2 fold, different from the conserved ring-building \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 folds (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burkhardt et al., 2012</a>). Thus, we hypothesize that this motif may form part of gate 2."

                        "text": "To determine the structure of the T4P machinery in the open state, the pipetting step during sample preparation was omitted (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019), which reduced the shearing forces and kept the assembled pilus intact (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Close inspection of the pilus shows a periodic structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), which was suitable for subtomogram averaging. Since the ice surrounding the pili was thin (\u223c100 nm), it was possible to apply CTF-correction. The structure of the pilus was determined at \u223c32 \u00c5 resolution by averaging 740 subvolumes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Power spectra calculated from a single tomographic slice or from the subtomogram average revealed a repeat distance of \u223c4.9 nm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, lower panels). The <i>T. thermophilus</i> pilus forms a right-handed helix of \u223c3 nm diameter (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), which is different from the previously determined electron cryo-microscopy structure of the isolated <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> T4P (<a href=\"#bib14\">Craig et al., 2006</a>). Diameters of pili can vary considerably and pilin proteins have limited sequence similarity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Craig and Li, 2008</a>), which likely accounts for this difference. The result may prompt a reassessment of the functional roles of different T4P in cells. Due to the more challenging sample preparation method, the structure of the open T4P machinery with the pilus extended was determined from only \u223c300 particles at \u223c45 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This resolution is sufficient to reveal the central protein channel complex with the \u223c3 nm pilus protein density in the centre (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). An extensive conformational change is evident that shifts PilQ domains N0\u2013N3 away from N4/N5 by \u223c30 \u00c5 towards the cytoplasmic membrane. This change opens the periplasmic vestibule to make way for the pilus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4E, 5A,B</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The shape and dimensions of the pore change from a tapered form ranging in width from \u223c4 nm (at N5) to \u223c8 nm (at N2/N3) in the closed state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), to a roughly constant 7 nm-wide channel in the open state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In comparison, the closed state of <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> PilQ is \u223c9 nm wide tapering to a point (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collins et al., 2004</a>), which would be sufficient to accommodate the wider <i>Neisseria</i> pilus (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Craig et al., 2006</a>) after a comparably large conformational change. Additional conformational changes and shifts also occur in protein densities P1, P2, and C1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In the open state, we observe an extra protein density in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, yellow arrowheads and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), which we speculate could be PilF, linked to the inner membrane platform via PilM (<a href=\"#bib25\">Karuppiah and Derrick, 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Homologous proteins have been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic ATPases, stimulating their activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lu et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2014</a>). Because EDTA treatment caused a depletion of periplasmic protein, we cannot exclude the possibility that some proteins may have been removed from the T4P machinery. However, we also averaged complexes from a tomogram of the two cells shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, which contained both open (with pili) and closed (without pili) complexes and where the periplasmic protein density was considerably higher. These subtomogram averages (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) show clearly that the same large conformational changes occur in the T4P machinery, irrespective of the degree of periplasmic protein depletion, and hence of the effect of EDTA."

However, <i>T. thermophilus</i> assembles \u223c6 pili per cell (<a href=\"#bib46\">Salzer et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">2015</a>), suggesting that \u223c80% of the complexes are not involved in pilus formation under standard growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib47\">Salzer et al., 2014c</a>). We speculate that these idle complexes may form a second class of transporter, which may be active in DNA uptake or protein secretion."

Subtomogram averages of the T4P machinery shown in all other figures were calculated from data collected at 33,000\u00d7 and 7 \u03bcm underfocus on the Titan Krios microscope. Coordinates corresponding to the outer membrane and inner membrane domains of the complex were marked manually in IMOD (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kremer et al., 1996</a>). Subvolumes from twice-binned tomograms were then extracted from NAD filtered (<a href=\"#bib17\">Frangakis and Hegerl, 2001</a>) data and an initial alignment and averaging performed in SPIDER (<a href=\"#bib18\">Frank et al., 1996</a>). This average was used as a reference for alignment and refinement using PEET (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nicastro et al., 2006</a>). We have previously shown that <i>T. thermophilus</i> PilQ is a dodecamer by biochemical analysis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burkhardt et al., 2011</a>), which is supported by single-particle electron microscopy of <i>N. meningitidis</i> PilQ (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2004</a>). Therefore, 12-fold symmetry was applied to the core complex by 30\u00b0 (360\u00b0/12 subunits) rotation of each subvolume prior to the alignment search. The final averages were obtained from 3984 particles for the closed complex and 312 particles for the open complex, using a mask drawn around PilQ. Any duplicates due to oversampling were removed in PEET (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nicastro et al., 2006</a>). Due to the larger sample size, data for the closed complex were replaced by unfiltered tomograms. For 2D comparisons between states (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, left panel and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), the NAD filtered version with low-contrast noise removed is shown. For the pilus, 740 subvolumes of \u223c2 nm length were selected in IMOD (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kremer et al., 1996</a>), from unbinned CTF-corrected tomograms collected at 5 \u03bcm underfocus on the Titan Krios microscope. Subvolumes were aligned and averaged with a cylindrical mask and any duplicates due to oversampling were removed in PEET (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nicastro et al., 2006</a>). Resolution estimates were obtained using conventional \u2018even/odd\u2019 Fourier shell correlation (FSC), applying the 0.5 FSC criterion. A mask was drawn around the protein to exclude membrane and peptidoglycan from this estimate. The averages in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> were smoothed by Gaussian filtering in UCSF Chimera, which was used to draw all surface views and remove low-contrast background noise using the \u2018hide dust\u2019 tool (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). The morph shown in <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> was produced in ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>).

These cells contained complexes both in the open and closed state (with and without pili). The subtomogram averages are shown in the new <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>. Due to the poorer signal-to-noise ratio in the denser periplasm, we were able to identify reliably only a total of 16 open (the eye is guided by the pilus) and 11 closed complexes from these 2 cells combined. Even after Gaussian filtering to reduce noise the data quality is worse than for averages from cells with a more depleted periplasm. The new figure shows the PilQ component plus protein P2, which have distinguishable features. It is clear from these new data that the same large conformational changes occur in the T4P machinery, irrespective of the degree of periplasmic protein depletion, and hence of the effect of EDTA.

The wide periplasm (containing thick layers of secondary cell wall polymers) and the surface clefts may be an environmental adaptation. The T4P machinery does not co-localize with the clefts, so we do not think that the two are linked. It is however plausible that the length of the PilQ secretin has adapted to the wide periplasm. Importantly, proteins of the T4P machinery are functionally conserved (Nudleman et al. 2004) and thus we speculate that the overall architecture is similar across species. We have included a comment is this regard in the manuscript (at the end of the Results and Discussion section)."

The distance of the layer lines from the equator is reciprocal to the pitch of the helix, which is measured as 1/(49 \u00c5) or 4.9 nm. From the subtomogram average volume, we measured a repeat distance of 5.5 nm. Considering that the pixel size in the average is 0.42 nm, this change of 0.6 nm is within reasonable error of only \u223c1.5 pixels. Calculation from the power spectra is less ambiguous, thus we especially thank the reviewers for this excellent suggestion. We have modified the repeat distance accordingly."

We have altered the Discussion and figure legend (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) in this respect. In the present work we have independently verified the width of the <i>T. thermophilus</i> pilus from two different samples. The first is from the subtomogram average of the open state, and the second is from the subtomogram average of the pilus alone. Both of these reveal an average width of \u223c3 nm, only half the width of the \u223c6 nm <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> pilus. Pili from various species have been shown previously to vary in diameter by negative stain electron microscopy and modelling, and apart from the N-terminus, sequences are not well conserved (<a href=\"#bib12\">Craig and Li 2008</a>). Thus it is not surprising that they exhibit structural differences at the cryoEM level. This point has been made clearer in the text (Results and Discussion).

The cryo structure shows that the channel is 9 nm wide, tapering to a point, and a homology model of the pilus (based on the <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> pilus) is shown to be 6.5 nm wide (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins et al. 2003</a>). The <i>Thermus</i> closed channel tapers from 8 nm at the widest point to 4 nm at the narrowest point, changing to a more constant 7 nm in the open state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Therefore it is apparent that very large conformational changes allow the width of the channel to alter considerably on pilus extrusion.

It is not surprising that a large complex that can undergo such major conformational changes may look slightly different after detergent solubilization and air-drying in negative stain. Nevertheless, whilst the ring spacing appears marginally altered, the dimensions of the subtomogram average of PilQ (diameter of complex, diameter of pore and length of complex) perfectly matches that of isolated PilQ. We have now included more of these comparative dimensions in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> to make this point clear.
