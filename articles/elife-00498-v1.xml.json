In metazoa, distinct stress conditions activate different eIF2\u03b1 kinases (PERK, PKR, GCN2, and HRI) that converge on phosphorylating a unique serine in eIF2\u03b1. This collection of signaling pathways is termed the \u2018integrated stress response\u2019 (ISR). eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation diminishes protein synthesis, while allowing preferential translation of some mRNAs. Starting with a cell-based screen for inhibitors of PERK signaling, we identified a small molecule, named ISRIB, that potently (IC<sub>50</sub> = 5 nM) reverses the effects of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. ISRIB reduces the viability of cells subjected to PERK-activation by chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress. eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is implicated in memory consolidation. Remarkably, ISRIB-treated mice display significant enhancement in spatial and fear-associated learning. Thus, memory consolidation is inherently limited by the ISR, and ISRIB releases this brake. As such, ISRIB promises to contribute to our understanding and treatment of cognitive disorders."

In metazoa, distinct stress conditions activate different eIF2\u03b1 kinases (PERK, PKR, GCN2, and HRI) that converge on phosphorylating a unique serine in eIF2\u03b1. This collection of signaling pathways is termed the \u2018integrated stress response\u2019 (ISR). eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation diminishes protein synthesis, while allowing preferential translation of some mRNAs. Starting with a cell-based screen for inhibitors of PERK signaling, we identified a small molecule, named ISRIB, that potently (IC<sub>50</sub> = 5 nM) reverses the effects of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. ISRIB reduces the viability of cells subjected to PERK-activation by chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress. eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is implicated in memory consolidation. Remarkably, ISRIB-treated mice display significant enhancement in spatial and fear-associated learning. Thus, memory consolidation is inherently limited by the ISR, and ISRIB releases this brake. As such, ISRIB promises to contribute to our understanding and treatment of cognitive disorders."

Upon phosphorylation of its \u03b1-subunit, eIF2 becomes a competitive inhibitor of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), eIF2B (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hinnebusch and Lorsch, 2012</a>). The tight and non-productive binding of phosphorylated eIF2 to eIF2B prevents loading of the eIF2 complex with GTP thus blocking ternary complex formation and reducing translation initiation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2001</a>).

The UPR is activated by unfolded or misfolded proteins that accumulate in the ER lumen because of an imbalance between protein folding load and protein folding capacity, a condition known as \u2018ER stress\u2019. In mammals, the UPR is comprised of three signaling branches mediated by ER-localized transmembrane sensors, PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. These sensor proteins detect the accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER and transmit the information across the ER membrane, initiating unique signaling pathways that converge in the activation of an extensive transcriptional response, which ultimately results in ER expansion (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ron and Walter, 2007</a>). The lumenal stress-sensing domains of PERK and IRE1 are homologous and likely activated in analogous ways by direct binding to unfolded peptides (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gardner and Walter, 2011</a>). This binding event leads to oligomerization and <i>trans</i>-autophosphorylation of their cytosolic kinase domains, and, for PERK, phosphorylation of its only known substrate, eIF2\u03b1. In this way, PERK activation results in a quick reduction in the load of newly synthesized proteins that are translocated into the ER-lumen (<a href=\"#bib12\">Harding et al., 2000</a>)."

To this end, we constructed a retroviral vector containing the open-reading frame of firefly luciferase fused to the 5\u2032UTR of ATF4 mRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which contains two short open-reading frames (uORFs) that control ATF4 translation in a stress-dependent manner. After infection, we established a HEK293T cell line harboring the stably integrated reporter. We used thapsigargin, a potent ER stressor that inhibits the ER calcium pump, to activate PERK and induce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Thapsigargin treatment resulted in a 4.9-fold induction in luciferase activity in a 384 well format with a Z factor of 0.5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This format was used to screen 106,281 compounds covering a wide chemical space. We identified 460 hits (0.43%) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), which were further validated in an 8-point dose-response assay using the same reporter. We further triaged the compounds by discarding inhibitors that also affected the IRE1 branch of the UPR using a luciferase-based XBP1 splicing reporter. Less than half (187 hits) of our initial hits proved unique to the PERK branch. We next used an orthogonal secondary screen that employed a different reporter (bi-cistronic ATF4-dGFP-IRES-mCherry) stably integrated into a different cell line (U2OS cells). The read-out of this latter screen was microscopy-based, which allowed us to simultaneously assess acute toxicity by cell counting, further reducing the number of viable hits to 77 (data not shown). As a tertiary screen, we tested compounds for their ability to inhibit ER stress-elicited induction of endogenous ATF4 by Western blot analysis. Twenty-eight compounds passed this test and were analyzed further."

This compound (henceforth referred to as \u2018ISRIB\u2019 for <span class=\"underline\">I</span>ntegrated <span class=\"underline\">S</span>tress <span class=\"underline\">R</span>esponse <span class=\"underline\">i</span>nhi<span class=\"underline\">b</span>itor) is a symmetric bis-glycolamide, containing a central bi-substituted cyclohexane, and can exist as two diastereomers, <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We synthesized both isomers and tested their ability to inhibit the ATF4-luciferase reporter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). <i>Trans</i>-ISRIB proved 100-fold more potent (IC<sub>50</sub> = 5 nM) than <i>cis</i>-ISRIB (IC<sub>50</sub> = 600 nM), indicating that the compound\u2019s interaction with its cellular target is stereospecific. Given the two-order-of-magnitude difference in activity in this assay, the measured activity of <i>cis</i>-ISRIB may be an over-estimate, as we cannot exclude a small contamination with <i>trans</i>-ISRIB, which is far more potent. The lower IC<sub>50</sub> of <i>trans</i>-ISRIB relative to the compound in the small molecule library indicates that the library likely contains a mixture of the two stereoisomers. All further experiments in this study were carried out with the synthesized <i>trans</i>-isomer of ISRIB."

PERK phosphorylation is indicative of its activation by autophosphorylation and can be recognized by reduced mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Notably, ISRIB did not inhibit the mobility shift of PERK observed in ER-stressed cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Rather, we observed an exaggerated mobility shift, indicative of increased phosphorylation of PERK upon ER stress, induced by either thapsigargin or tunicamycin (an inhibitor of <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation). In each case, in the absence of ISRIB, ATF4 and XBP1s were produced upon ER stress induction. In agreement with the behavior of the reporters described above, ISRIB blocked production of endogenous ATF4, whereas XBP1 mRNA splicing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and XBP1s production persisted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Upon induction of ER stress by tunicamycin or thapsigargin, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 increased over time, reaching a fourfold and sevenfold increase after 120 min respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Unexpectedly, ISRIB did not block eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation under either of these ER stress-inducing conditions.

Based on these observations, we wondered whether treatment of mice with ISRIB would affect memory. ISRIB showed favorable properties in pharmacokinetic profiling experiments indicating sufficient bioavailability for in vivo studies. ISRIB displayed a half-life in plasma of 8 hr (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and readily crossed the blood-brain barrier, quickly equilibrating with the central nervous system (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). After a single intraperitoneal injection, we detected ISRIB in the brain of mice at concentrations several fold higher than its IC<sub>50</sub> (24 hr after injection, the ISRIB concentration in the brain was approximately 60 nM). To explore ISRIB's effects on memory, we injected mice intraperitoneally with ISRIB and tested hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. To this end, we trained mice in a Morris water maze, in which animals learn to associate visual cues with the location of a submerged hidden platform. Because we were looking for memory enhancement, we used a weak training protocol. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, ISRIB-treated mice reached the hidden platform significantly faster (escape latency after 5 days of training = 16.4 \u00b1 4.8 s) compared to vehicle treated controls (68.1 \u00b1 20 s, p&lt;0.05). The difference was already pronounced by days 3 and 4. In agreement with these results, ISRIB-treated mice significantly preferred the target quadrant in a \u2018probe test\u2019 conducted at the end of the training sessions, in which the platform was removed from the pool (p&lt;0.05; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) and showed increased crossing of the platform location (p&lt;0.05; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>)."

ISRIB is the first reported antagonist of the ISR. It acts as a potent and stereospecific inhibitor with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 5 nM in cultured cells, suggesting a specific and tight interaction with its cellular target. By blocking signaling through the PERK branch of the UPR, ISRIB prevents cells from re-establishing ER homeostasis. Unmitigated ER stress synergizes with ISRIB to induce apoptosis. ISRIB shows good pharmacokinetic properties, readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, and exhibits no overt toxicity in mice, making it suitable for in vivo studies. As such, ISRIB emerges as a powerful tool to explore the roles of the UPR and the ISR in disease models and physiological processes. In particular, we utilized ISRIB to show that overriding the consequences of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation enhances memory consolidation in rodents, suggesting an important role of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in modulating higher-order brain function."

Precedence for this possibility derives from genetic studies in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, where the molecular mechanism of regulation by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was first discovered. As in mammalian cells, amino acid starvation in yeast leads to GCN2 activation and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, resulting in overall translational down-regulation and translational induction of a transcriptional activator, GCN4, mediated by uORFs in the 5\u2032UTR of its mRNA (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hinnebusch, 2005</a>). eIF2B is a conserved protein complex comprised of five different subunits, two of which form the catalytic core, and the remaining three have regulatory roles. Mutations in different eIF2B subunits can elicit a phospho-eIF2\u03b1 resistant phenotype (<a href=\"#bib39\">Vazquez de Aldana and Hinnebusch, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pavitt et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">1998</a>). These mutations have been proposed to act either by weakening the interaction of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 with eIF2B, reducing its ability to outcompete non-phosphorylated eIF2 for binding, or by allowing binding of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 to the mutant eIF2B in a manner that is conducive to nucleotide exchange. ISRIB could be altering the affinity of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 for eIF2B or overcoming the nonproductive interaction that blocks GTP loading, mimicking the effect of these mutations."

Precedence for this possibility derives from studies in macrophages, where engagement of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 results in activation of the catalytic activity of eIF2B (<a href=\"#bib43\">Woo et al., 2012</a>). This activation results from engagement of the TLR-signaling pathway that induces a phosphatase removing a constitutively present inhibitory phosphate from the eIF2B \u03b5-subunit (S539). Pathogens utilize this mechanism to circumvent translational attenuation and CHOP production under prolonged stress-inducing conditions (<a href=\"#bib42\">Woo et al., 2009</a>). ISRIB did not reduce phosphorylation of S539 in the eIF2B \u03b5-subunit (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that it does not utilize this particular regulatory phosphorylation to increase GEF activity.

When faced with ER stress, PERK-mediated translational attenuation contributes to adaptation by reducing the load of newly synthesized proteins that are translocated into the ER (<a href=\"#bib12\">Harding et al., 2000</a>). In addition, induction of the transcription regulator ATF4 upregulates many genes that increase the protein folding capacity in the ER. Both of these activities serve to reestablish homeostasis, balancing the protein folding load and protein folding capacity in the ER lumen. This reasoning is supported by the increased sensitivity to ER stress exhibited by MEFs that lack PERK or ATF4, as well as MEFs that carry a non-phosphorylatable knock-in allele of eIF2\u03b1(S51A) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Harding et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Harding et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2004</a>). In agreement, we show that ISRIB decreases the viability of cells that are subjected to ER-stress. In these cells, ISRIB sustains IRE1 and ATF6 activation, indicating that ER stress remains unmitigated in the absence of PERK signaling. As some cancer cells sustain an activated UPR to aid in their survival, ISRIB could provide a new therapeutic approach to cancer chemotherapy. In agreement, a PERK-specific inhibitor demonstrates antitumor activity in a human pancreatic tumor xenograft model (<a href=\"#bib1\">Axten et al., 2012</a>). The deleterious synergistic effect between ER-stress and ISRIB may be generally advantageous to kill cancer cells, especially those derived from secretory lineages that have increased secretory load and increased basal levels of ER stress (including myelomas, and pancreatic and breast cancers)."

In particular, the threshold for induction of L-LTP is reduced and memory consolidation is enhanced in mice lacking GCN2 or PKR and in mice heterozygous for non-phosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1(S51A), which have reduced levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). As we show here, ISRIB pharmacologically phenocopies these genetic manipulations in behavioral tasks by rendering cells insensitive to eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. In agreement, treatment of mice with a PKR inhibitor was reported to enhance memory consolidation, and, conversely, treatment with salubrinal, an inhibitor that prolongs eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, to block L-LTP and memory consolidation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>)."

Both may be important to explain the observed effects on L-LTP and memory. It has long been appreciated that new protein synthesis is required for memory consolidation and that ATF4 represses CREB-mediated transcription of \u2018memory genes\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Klann and Dever, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</a>). Indeed, this latter function of ATF4 in memory consolidation is evolutionarily conserved from <i>Aplysia</i> to rodents (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yin et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartsch et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2003</a>). Because a small physiological increase in the level of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation that does not significantly alter overall translation is sufficient to induce ATF4, production of this transcription factor can be finely tuned in neuronal cells by perhaps selective activation of different eIF2\u03b1 kinases. The observed effects of ISRIB may therefore result from overcoming effects caused by a relatively small level of regulatory phosphorylation that is distinct from the high level resulting from ER stress-inducing agents. In light of this reasoning, a therapeutic window may exist in which ISRIB\u2019s effects as memory enhancer can be exploited without encountering long-term toxic consequences."

Evolution therefore did not arrive at a maximally optimized process, imposing a brake (via eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation) on memory consolidation. This mechanism may underscore the importance of filtering memories before committing them to long-term storage. Indeed, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation also plays a role in dynamic restructuring of memory, as indicated by studies showing that ablation of PERK in the brain impairs behavioral flexibility (<a href=\"#bib37\">Trinh et al., 2012</a>). Our findings raise the possibility that ISRIB or compounds with related activities could serve as invaluable tools in deciphering these higher order brain functions and perhaps be beneficial as a therapeutic agent effecting memory improvement in diseases associated with memory impairment."

ISRIB (0.05 mg/ml, 0.5 \u03bcl) was infused bilaterally into the amygdala immediately after auditory fear conditioning training. The infusion was performed with a microinjector (28 gauge) connected to a Hamilton syringe with plastic tubing at a rate of 0.25 \u03bcl/min. To allow for the solution containing ISRIB to diffuse from the tip of the cannula into the tissue, the microinjector stayed in the cannula for one additional minute. Training protocol for auditory fear conditioning consisted of a 2-min period of context A exploration, followed by one pairing of a tone (5000 Hz, 75 dB, 30 s) with a co-terminating foot shock (0.75 mA, 1 s). Rats were returned to their home cage 1 min after the shock. Test for auditory fear memory consisted of a 2 min acclimatizing period to the context B (pre-CS), followed by tone presentation (CS) (2800 Hz, 85 dB, 30 s). Freezing time was measured and percent of freezing was calculated. At the end of the experiment, cannula placement was checked by examining 50 \u03bcm brain sections stained with formal-thionin under a light microscope."

Our strategy is to develop appropriate biochemical assays to unravel the molecular mechanism after identification of its target. Although increasing eIF2B activity or decreasing the interaction of phospho- eIF2\u03b1 with eIF2B are possible modes in which ISRIB could generate a resistant phenotype, there are many other ways in which this molecule could act. For example ISRIB could modulate the interaction between eIF2 and eIF5, which acts as a GAP and GDI. We believe that the unbiased search for ISRIB\u2019s target will be a more linear path to unravel its mechanism of action than ruling in or out individual possibilities."

Cell Biol, January 2012). ISRIB does not elicit this phenotype by modulating this phosphorylation site.
