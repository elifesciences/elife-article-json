To further reveal the functional significance of RBPs during neural development, we carried out an in vivo RNAi screen in the dorsal spinal cord interneurons, including the commissural neurons. We found that the NOVA family of RBPs play a key role in neuronal migration, axon outgrowth, and axon guidance. Interestingly, <i>Nova</i> mutants display similar defects as the knockout of the <i>Dcc</i> transmembrane receptor. We show here that <i>Nova</i> deficiency disrupts the alternative splicing of <i>Dcc</i>, and that restoring <i>Dcc</i> splicing in <i>Nova</i> knockouts is able to rescue the defects. Together, our results demonstrate that the production of DCC splice variants controlled by NOVA has a crucial function during many stages of commissural neuron development."

To further reveal the functional significance of RBPs during neural development, we carried out an in vivo RNAi screen in the dorsal spinal cord interneurons, including the commissural neurons. We found that the NOVA family of RBPs play a key role in neuronal migration, axon outgrowth, and axon guidance. Interestingly, <i>Nova</i> mutants display similar defects as the knockout of the <i>Dcc</i> transmembrane receptor. We show here that <i>Nova</i> deficiency disrupts the alternative splicing of <i>Dcc</i>, and that restoring <i>Dcc</i> splicing in <i>Nova</i> knockouts is able to rescue the defects. Together, our results demonstrate that the production of DCC splice variants controlled by NOVA has a crucial function during many stages of commissural neuron development."

We used PAX3/7 antibodies to label the dorsal interneuron progenitors that give rise to different populations of commissural and ipsilateral neurons (<a href=\"#bib7\">Caspary and Anderson, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Helms and Johnson, 2003</a>). <i>Pax3</i> and <i>Pax7</i> are required to specify the majority of commissural neurons, as their double knockout greatly reduces the ventral commissure formed by commissural axons crossing the midline (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mansouri and Gruss, 1998</a>). We labeled differentiated interneurons with antibodies\u00a0against\u00a0BARHL2 and LHX5, two transcription factors among many others that are expressed by post-mitotic interneurons. Combinations of these transcription factors define the different lineages of commissural and ipsilateral neurons (<a href=\"#bib7\">Caspary and Anderson, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Helms and Johnson, 2003</a>). We also labeled commissural axons specifically with anti-ROBO3 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sabatier et al., 2004</a>). Our studies show that the GFP+ neurons within the VZ are dorsal interneuron progenitors and the ones at the lateral spinal cord are differentiated interneurons. In addition, the GFP+ axons that fail to project to the midline are commissural axons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Furthermore, using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we found that the GFP+ neuroprogenitors and interneurons also express <i>Dcc</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with previous reports that <i>Dcc</i> is expressed in these neuronal populations (<a href=\"#bib34\">Keino-Masu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Phan et al., 2011</a>).

We examined cell proliferation in <i>Nova</i> and <i>Dcc</i> KOs using cell cycle markers, including phospho-histone H3 (pH3), a mitotic marker, and Ki-67, a cell proliferation marker. We found that at\u00a0E10.5,\u00a0the number of neural stem cells and progenitors is normal in both mutants (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Alternative splicing has been increasingly implicated as an important means to generate temporal and spatial specific functions for guidance molecules (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Park and Graveley, 2007</a>). To further understand the functional significance of alternative splicing, it is important to identify the relevant splicing factors and their targets.

The phenotypic similarity between <i>Nova</i> and <i>Dcc</i> KOs strongly suggests that <i>Dcc</i> activity is affected by <i>Nova</i> dKO. Indeed, this is confirmed by the observations that <i>Dcc</i> alternative splicing is disrupted by <i>Nova</i> dKO (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), that <i>Nova</i> dKO defects can be largely rescued in vitro and in vivo by restoring <i>Dcc<sub>long\u00a0</sub></i>(<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>), and that NOVA controls <i>Dcc</i> alternative splicing in vitro (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>).

The axon guidance defect also appears to be somewhat alleviated at E12.5 compared to earlier stages (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This delay could be due to an incomplete loss of the gene function in the KOs. Alternatively, NOVA proteins have been shown to regulate many target genes including <i>Dcc</i> in a temporal specific manner, generating different ratios of splice variants at different developmental stages (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yano et al., 2010</a>; also see accompanying paper by Saito et al.) As <i>Nova</i> deficiency changes the ratio between DCC variants, it may alter the developmental state of the neurons.

One possibility is that DCC<sub>long</sub> is fully responsible for the gene function, whereas DCC<sub>short</sub> has no activity. Another is that both isoforms are required and each has its specific activity.

Since the two <i>Dcc</i> isoforms are normally expressed at comparable levels in commissural axons at E11.5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), it is likely that each isoform has its unique activity during neuronal migration and axon guidance."

Cells were cultured for 48\u2009hr and the total RNA was collected using Trizol (Thermo Fisher). Reverse transcription was carried out from a T7 promoter (present in pDEST26) using SMARTScribe reverse transcriptase (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), and semi-quantitative PCR was performed to amplify multiple isoforms. Point mutations were introduced by PCR reactions using Pfu polymerase (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A V5 tag at the C-terminus of NOVA1, NOVA2, and PTBP2 was used to confirm protein expression using western blotting."

Currently you use fairly coarse read-outs to characterize the anatomical phenotypes. Many assessments are semi-quantitative and do not allow for an estimate of what fraction of the manipulated cells are affected. There is no doubt that the phenotypes exist and are rescued by the overexpression of the long DCC splice isoform but it remains unknown how severe the phenotypes are and whether they persist at later stages of development. Please attempt to provide more quantitative analyses and report if the phenotypes persist at later stages."

Commissural neurons are born in the dorsal spinal cord, migrate laterally, and then ventrally to populate regions in the dorsal half of the spinal cord. These neurons send axons ventrally across the floor plate to the contralateral side of the spinal cord. Removal of both NOVA1 and NOVA2, first shown using RNAi and then through traditional mutations, disrupts the development of these neurons. Data are presented that these neurons differentiate normally, as assessed by various markers, but they show abnormalities in cell migration (both laterally and ventrally) and in axon guidance to the ventral midline. As these phenotypes are similar to DCC loss-of-function mutations, the authors sought to explore the relationship between NOVA1/2 and DCC function. DCC is a receptor for netrin; netrin is expressed in the ventral half of the spinal cord and plays an important role in regulating the ventral migration of commissural neurons and the guidance of the growth cones to the floor plate."

The phenotypic analyses and quantifications of knockout embryos and of neuronal explants were carried out using previously published methods. It is technically challenging to assess the phenotypes in cultured embryos labeled with <i>Actb-gfp (\u03b2actin-gfp</i>). The GFP is expressed throughout the cell bodies and the neurites and the neurons are closely positioned, making it difficult to discern individual neurons. We thus compared the overall signal from the ventricular zone with that from the lateral spinal cord to assess neuronal migration. It is also difficult to count GFP+ axons as they form bundles, and to measure the axon length as the cell bodies are positioned at different dorsoventral level. With that said, we have performed the following quantifications to improve our data."
