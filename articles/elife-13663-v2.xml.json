We describe here the identification of an intracellular trigger of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1\u03b2 production and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages that is mediated by the disruption of glycolytic flux. This signal results from a drop of NADH levels and induction of mitochondrial ROS production and can be rescued by addition of products that restore NADH production. This signal is also important for host-cell response to the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, which can disrupt metabolism by uptake of host-cell glucose. These results reveal an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens."

We describe here the identification of an intracellular trigger of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1\u03b2 production and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages that is mediated by the disruption of glycolytic flux. This signal results from a drop of NADH levels and induction of mitochondrial ROS production and can be rescued by addition of products that restore NADH production. This signal is also important for host-cell response to the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, which can disrupt metabolism by uptake of host-cell glucose. These results reveal an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens."

Because excessive inflammation can be damaging, its initiation is highly regulated. Innate immune cells such as macrophages have evolved sensors of pathogens and homeostatic perturbations which, when activated, induce an immune response (<a href=\"#bib30\">Medzhitov, 2008</a>). Amongst these sensors are Nod-like receptors (NLRs), which are activated in response to a diverse set of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Activated NLR proteins recruit and facilitate activation of the protease caspase-1 either directly, through caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) interactions, or indirectly, through the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC; also known as <i>Pycard</i>). The resulting macromolecular complex is referred to as the inflammasome (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</a>). The inactive precursor of the cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (pro-IL-1\u03b2) is also recruited to the inflammasome complex, where proteolysis by caspase-1 induces activation and secretion of the bioactive cytokine, further promoting inflammation. In addition to cytokine maturation, inflammasome formation and caspase activation are associated with a pro-inflammatory form of cell death termed pyroptosis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fink and Cookson, 2006</a>). This form of cell death results in lytic release of cytosolic contents and other pro-inflammatory factors such as interleukin-1\u03b1 and high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), which are potent inducers of inflammation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Medzhitov, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Croker et al., 2014</a>)."

The NLR NLRP3 is a sensor of a wide variety of PAMPs and DAMPs but the unifying mechanism of its disparate activators is not understood (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sutterwala et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, while the NLRP3 signaling pathway can be activated by a variety of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, the mechanism by which these pathogens induce inflammasome signaling through this receptor is often unclear (<a href=\"#bib38\">Storek and Monack, 2015</a>). Specifically, effective defense against <i>Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium)</i> requires NLRP3 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Broz et al., 2010</a>), yet the mechanism by which the pathogen activates this pathway remains unknown."

Using chemical proteomics, we identify the glycolytic enzymes GAPDH and \u03b1-enolase as the phenotypically relevant targets of this molecule. Facilitating TCA metabolism downstream of glycolysis by addition of pyruvate or succinate blocked the effects of the compound. We find that <i>S. typhimurium</i> infection, like direct chemical inhibition of the glycolytic enzymes, reduced glycolytic flux and that restoring metabolism downstream of glycolysis also prevented <i>S. typhimurium</i>-induced inflammasome formation, IL-1\u03b2 secretion, and pyroptosis. We find that glycolytic disruption induced by either the small molecules or <i>S. typhimurium</i> infection impaired NADH production, resulting in the\u00a0formation of mitochondrial ROS that were essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Therefore, disruption of glycolytic flux is a biologically relevant trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that is mediated by mitochondrial redox changes, revealing a mechanistic link between cellular metabolism and initiation of inflammation."

To accomplish this, we first conducted a small structure-activity relationship (SAR) study in which we synthesized a series of analogs of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> to identify compounds that could be used for affinity isolation of labeled targets. We identified a number of modifications to the primary compound scaffold that resulted in loss of activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), suggesting that the effects of the parent compound are likely dictated by affinity to specific protein targets. Importantly, our SAR efforts identified both an inactive analog (GB-IA) as well as an azide-containing analog (az-GB) that retained the inflammasome-activating ability of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We used this azide analog as a probe to identify potential protein targets using Click chemistry to attach a fluorescent tag (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) or affinity tag (biotin) to labeled target proteins. The choice of this probe does limit identification to covalent binding partners. However, because removal of the acyloxymethylketone\u00a0(AOMK) electrophile from GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> (compound 2) resulted in loss of the ability of the compound to induce IL-1\u03b2 secretion, we reasoned that the compound likely acted through covalent modification of its relevant targets."

To further investigate the proposed covalent interaction of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> with reactive cysteine residues in GAPDH and \u03b1-enolase, we performed competition studies with the general cysteine reative probe iodoacetamide fluorescein (IAF). IAF labeled both GAPDH and \u03b1-enolase, consistent with previous reactive cysteine profiling data demonstrating that the catalytic Cys 152 of GAPDH is highly reactive and Cys 388, an active-site proximal cysteine of \u03b1-enolase, is also reactive (<a href=\"#bib47\">Weerapana et al., 2010</a>).

Productive glycolysis results in conversion of NAD+ to NADH, secretion of lactate, and ATP production (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). To first test the hypothesis that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>, KA, and EB block glycolytic flux we measured the ratio of NAD+/NADH, lactate production, and intracellular ATP concentration in inhibitor-treated BMDM. LPS stimulation, which up-regulates glycolysis in macrophages (<a href=\"#bib26\">Krawczyk et al., 2010</a>), resulted in an increase in NADH levels (demonstrated by a decrease in NAD+/NADH ratio) and an increase in lactate secretion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> treatment completely blocked the lactate and NADH production induced by LPS stimulation, indicating that it directly impaired LPS-induced glycolytic flux (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). ATP production was also significantly impaired in LPS-primed BMDM upon GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Notably, treatment with the NLRP3 activator nigericin did not reduce NADH levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that the metabolic disruption that we observed with GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> is not a general feature of inflammasome activation and cell death. The GAPDH and \u03b1-enolase inhibitors KA and EB also affected metrics of glycolytic flux (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). Finally, GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> suppressed the increase in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) induced by glucose stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). 2DG, a glycolytic inhibitor that targets hexokinase, did not dramatically impair glycolytic flux (as measured by NADH production and lactate secretion) and did not induce inflammasome formation (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This indicates that severe limitation of glycolytic flux is required to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, these results are in accord with recent studies showing that inhibiting GAPDH, and not enzymes in upper glycolysis, is flux-limiting in highly glycolytic cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Shestov et al., 2014</a>). Inhibitors of the TCA cycle and pentose-phosphate pathways (AA5 and 6-AN, respectively), carbohydrate metabolism pathways that are closely tied to glycolysis, also had no effect on lactate secretion or NADH production in LPS-primed BMDM and did not induce IL-1\u03b2 secretion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

We hypothesized that supplementation of downstream metabolites of glycolysis would restore partial metabolic function and block the NLRP3-activating signal. When we cultured GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>-treated BMDMs with cell-permeable versions of the terminal metabolite of glycolysis, pyruvate, or the TCA cycle metabolite succinate, we observed a dramatic reduction in the number of inflammasome foci that formed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). A structurally related metabolite, lactate, which does not fuel the TCA cycle, did not reduce GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>-induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Doubling the media concentration of L-glutamine, a metabolite that can be converted into succinate via anaplerosis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Tannahill et al., 2013</a>), significantly reduced the number of inflammasomes that formed. Complete removal of L-glutamine from media sensitized BMDM to GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>-induced inflammasome formation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

To test whether either of these signals is important, we manipulated the NAD+/NADH and ATP levels downstream of glycolysis by chemically blocking specific components of the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. We first treated LPS-primed BMDM with GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> and pyruvate to block glycolysis and stimulate downstream metabolism. We then added the succinate dehydrogenase (TCA cycle enzyme) inhibitor AA5 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Miyadera et al., 2003</a>) to reduce NADH levels, the Complex I inhibitor rotenone to increase NADH levels and reduce ATP production, or the ATP synthase inhibitor Oligomycin A to only inhibit ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B</a>). We found that AA5 addition partially reversed the protection conferred by pyruvate, as demonstrated by an increase in the number of inflammasome complexes. Rotenone treatment suppressed inflammasome formation more than pyruvate alone. Oligomycin A induced a small but statistically insignificant increase in the number of inflammasomes that formed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). The number of inflammasomes positively correlated with a drop in NADH production (an increase in NAD+/NADH ratio) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), while ATP concentration exhibited no correlation with the numbers of inflammasomes (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, rotenone treatment was sufficient to completely abrogate inflammasome formation induced by GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), conditions under which we also observed a significant decrease in the NAD+/NADH ratio (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). These data suggest that the inability to produce NADH, and not ATP, is predictive of NLRP3 inflammasome formation upon glycolytic disruption by GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>. It should be noted, however, that the \u03b1-enolase inhibitor EB did not induce a significant NAD+/NADH ratio defect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), suggesting that either EB induces inflammasome activation through a distinct mechanism from GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> and KA, or that there are additional universal signals responsible for inflammasome activation downstream of glycolytic disruption."

Therefore, we wanted to determine whether either of these signals is relevant to NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by disruption of glycolysis. We stained BMDM with MitoSOX, a dye that reports accumulation of mitochondrial ROS, and observed that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> induced an increase in cellular MitoSOX fluorescence that was abrogated by addition of pyruvate (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). We also found that the ROS scavenger 4-hydroxyTEMPO (4-HT) prevented GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>-induced caspase-1 cleavage and activation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). Addition of extracellular K+, in contrast, did not reduce the number of inflammasome foci in GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>-treated BMDMs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I</a>) or impair GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that mitochondrial ROS, but not K+ efflux, is required for GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>-induced NLRP3 activation and pyroptosis."

                                "text": "We and others have shown that the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium</i>) requires glucose and its own glycolytic enzymes for intracellular replication (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bowden et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">2014</a>). In addition, host defense against <i>S. typhimurium</i> requires the NLRC4 and NLRP3 inflammasomes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Broz et al., 2010</a>). While it is clear that <i>S. typhimurium</i> flagellin and type 3 secretion system proteins activate NLRC4 via NAIP proteins (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>), the mechanism by which NLRP3 is activated is not well understood. We hypothesized that <i>S. typhimurium</i> infection may stimulate NLRP3 through disruption of host cell metabolic pathways by co-opting cellular resources during intracellular replication. To test this notion, we infected na\u00efve BMDM with <i>S. typhimurium</i> grown to stationary phase (conditions that lead to NLRP3-dependent inflammasome activation [<a href=\"#bib6\">Broz et al., 2010</a>]). In this infection model, inflammasome complexes begin forming at ~11\u2009hr post-infection and progressively accumulate. We confirmed that infection with either wildtype <i>S. typhimurium</i> or <i>S. typhimurium</i> lacking the SPI-1 secretion system (which genetically limits <i>S. typhimurium</i> to activate NLRP3) induced inflammasome formation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013B</a>). In addition, the percentage of cells with ASC foci was similar in magnitude to GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> and alum treatment but lower than nigericin, ATP, or log phase <i>S. typhimurium</i> stimulation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Using this infection model, we assessed the extent to which intracellular <i>S. typhimurium</i> utilize host-cell glucose by culturing infected BMDM with the fluorescent glucose analog 2-(<i>N</i>-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG). We lysed infected BMDM at 5\u2009hr post-infection (while bacteria are still intracellular), harvested the bacterial fraction of BMDM lysates, and measured 2-NBDG fluorescence. We observed fluorescent signal that was dependent on infection in 2-NBDG-treated macrophages, indicating that the bacterial fraction took up the fluorescent glucose analog from the host cell (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). We also fixed uninfected and infected 2-NBDG-treated BMDM and analyzed the pattern of 2-NBDG fluorescence by confocal microscopy. We observed the presence of strongly 2-NBDG fluorescent punctae that resemble <i>S. typhimurium</i> and colocalize with Hoechst stain (which stains both host cell and bacterial DNA) in infected BMDM. Furthermore, we quantified the portions of cytosol that were not Hoechst-positive and observed a significant decrease in 2-NDBG fluorescence in the cytosol of infected BMDM compared to uninfected BMDM (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). These data indicate that intracellular <i>S. typhimurium</i> derive glucose from host macrophages and reduce host glucose availability."

Formation of the inflammasome leads to processing and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines to activate the immune system (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Biswas and Mantovani, 2012</a>). While inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death are critical for fighting infection and also contribute to inflammation in diseases including type II diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kuemmerle-Deschner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">2012</a>), the signals that trigger caspase-1 activation remain poorly understood. In this study, we used a small molecule, GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>, to identify two glycolytic enzymes that regulate inflammasome formation. When functionally blocked, innate immune cells sense metabolic perturbation as a danger signal, resulting in inflammasome formation, caspase-1 activation, and cytokine secretion. Our results using this molecule and other established inhibitors of these enzymes suggest that disrupting glycolytic flux serves as a trigger for inflammation and cell death in macrophages. Disturbance of glycolytic flux by the intracellular pathogen <i>S. typhimurium</i> similarly results in inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death in an effort to clear the pathogen. Restoration of metabolism downstream of glycolytic disruption by GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> or <i>S. typhimurium</i> infection was sufficient to abrogate the inflammasome response by restoring NADH production and preventing mitochondrial ROS production."

The irreversible reactions within glycolysis, catalyzed by hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase, were historically thought to be rate limiting. However, recent metabolite flux analyses have also suggested that flux through GAPDH, the enzyme separating upper and lower glycolysis, is rate-limiting under nutrient-rich conditions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Shestov et al., 2014</a>). Under similar conditions, we also observed that targeting GAPDH or enzymes in lower glycolysis is sufficient to disrupt glycolytic flux and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Conversely, targeting entry into glycolysis using 2DG was not sufficient to disrupt glycolysis in highly glycolytic cells, as has previously been reported (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pietzke et al., 2014</a>), or to activate NLRP3. This reaffirms previous observations that the pre-existing metabolic state of the cell and the point of intervention are equally important for effectively limiting glycolytic flux (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sengupta et al., 2013</a>). Disruption of glycolytic flux led to an NAD+/NADH imbalance and induced mitochondrial ROS accumulation, which has been shown here and elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tschopp and Schroder, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhou et al., 2010</a>) to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."

Two inflammasome complexes, NLRP3 and NLRC4, are required to fully combat infection (<a href=\"#bib6\">Broz et al., 2010</a>). The NLRC4 inflammasome responds to a clear pathogen-associated molecular pattern presented by <i>S. typhimurium</i>\u2014cytosolic flagellin and type 3 secretion system components (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>). Here, we provide evidence that NLRP3 activation results in response to another effect of <i>S. typhimurium</i> colonization of the host cell, namely disruption of host cell glycolytic metabolism. This could explain a recent study showing that mutants of <i>S. typhimurium</i> defective for the TCA cycle enzyme aconitase induce a more rapid NLRP3-dependent immune response in vivo (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wynosky-Dolfi et al., 2014</a>). We reason that aconitase deficiency would force <i>S. typhimurium</i> to rely even more heavily on glycolysis to survive within the host. These <i>S. typhimurium</i> mutants would likely disrupt cellular glycolysis more quickly and thus activate NLRP3 more rapidly. It is also interesting that, in long-term models of <i>S. typhimurium</i> infection, the bacteria preferentially resides within alternatively activated or \u2018M2\u2019 macrophages, which primarily utilize oxidative metabolism rather than glycolysis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eisele et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the macrophages in which <i>Salmonella</i> survives the longest are those in which host metabolic pathways are minimally perturbed, enabling prolonged infection without invoking an inflammasome response."

For example, metabolic sensing by immune cells has been recently shown to drive NLRP3-dependent IL-1\u03b2 release and inflammation in diseases ranging from type II diabetes and obesity to Muckle-Wells syndrome (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kuemmerle-Deschner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Strowig et al., 2012</a>), though the specific mechanisms driving macrophage and NLRP3 activation in these diseases have remained unclear. We speculate that, since glucose metabolism is often impaired in these diseases, glycolytic impairment may be the mechanism driving NLRP3-dependent inflammation. Restoring glycolysis or downstream TCA cycle metabolism through supplementation with specific metabolites or activation of glycolytic enzymes could be therapeutically useful for dampening inflammation and associated immunopathology."

Glycolytic disruption may be a broadly relevant mechanism of NLRP3 activation triggered in response to metabolic parasitism by microbes. Moreover, this pathway may also provide novel avenues for treating diseases in which NLRP3-driven inflammation results in pathology."

The initial findings were made using a small-molecule phenotypic screen, which furnished a covalent ligand that blocks GAPDH and enolase activity. This compound, as well as other GAPDH and enolase inhibitors, promoted NLRP3 inflammasome formation, and this effect was blocked by treating cells with the glycolytic end product pyruvate. Further studies indicate that reductions in NADH are important for promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Similar effects were also observed in macrophages infected with <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, which appears to impair macrophage glycolysis by consuming host glucose."

At the very least this discrepancy between the effect of pyruvate on <i>Salmonella</i>-induced inflammasome activation and GB111 induced inflammasome activation should be discussed.

As the Reviewer notes, GAPDH has an active site cysteine. Our collaborator (Weerapana et al., Nature 2010) has identified a reactive cysteine in \u03b1-enolase that can be labeled with iodoacetamide. Based on the crystal structure of human \u03b1-enolase (Kang et al., Acta Crystallogr Sect D 2008), this cysteine, Cys 388 is close to the entrance to the enzyme\u2019s substrate-binding site.
