However, to date there has been no quantitative evaluation of the stability of heterochromatic gene repression.  We designed a genetic strategy to capture transient losses of gene silencing in <i>Saccharomyces</i> as permanent, heritable changes in genotype and phenotype.  This approach revealed rare transcription within heterochromatin that occurred in approximately 1/1000 cell divisions.  In concordance with multiple lines of evidence suggesting these events were rare and transient, single-molecule RNA FISH showed that transcription was limited.  The ability to monitor fluctuations in heterochromatic repression uncovered previously unappreciated roles for Sir1, a silencing establishment factor, in the maintenance and/or inheritance of silencing.  In addition, we identified the sirtuin Hst3 and its histone target as contributors to the stability of the silenced state.  These approaches revealed dynamics of a heterochromatin function that have been heretofore inaccessible."
