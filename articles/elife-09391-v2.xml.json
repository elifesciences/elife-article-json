This signal activation occurs only when pathogenic RNA is identified, despite the ability of RIG-I to bind endogenous RNA while surveying the cytoplasm. Here we show that ATP binding and hydrolysis by RIG-I play a key role in the identification of viral targets and the activation of signaling. Using biochemical and cell-based assays together with mutagenesis, we show that ATP binding, and not hydrolysis, is required for RIG-I signaling on viral RNA. However, we show that ATP hydrolysis does provide an important function by recycling RIG-I and promoting its dissociation from non-pathogenic RNA. This activity provides a valuable proof-reading mechanism that enhances specificity and prevents an antiviral response upon encounter with host RNA molecules."

The precise molecular determinants for functional RNA recognition by RIG-I have been well characterized through structural, biochemical and cell-based approaches (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schlee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Luo et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kohlway et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goubau et al., 2014</a>). However, the specific roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis in activating RIG-I for immune signaling have not been defined or differentiated. Mutational studies have underscored the key role of conserved amino acids within the ATPase active-site of RIG-I. For example, residues that are required for ATP hydrolysis, such as the conserved lysine within helicase motif I (the Walker A motif), or the conserved glutamate and aspartate residues within motif II, exhibit dramatically reduced signaling capabilities (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yoneyama et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bamming and Horvath, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rawling et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, RIG-I signaling is not impaired by motif III mutations that significantly perturb ATPase activity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bamming and Horvath, 2009</a>), thereby making it difficult to establish a direct relationship between hydrolysis and signaling. Alternative roles proposed for ATP hydrolysis include translocation and filament formation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Myong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Patel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Peisley et al., 2013</a>), however these functions have not been shown to be absolutely necessary for signaling by RIG-I (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kohlway et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Louber et al., 2014</a>). Thus, the function of ATPase activity in RIG-I signaling remains unclear."

While robust signaling is often associated with ATP hydrolysis activity (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yoneyama et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bamming and Horvath, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Luo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kohlway et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Patel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Peisley et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rawling et al., 2015</a>), the ability of an RNA ligand to stimulate RIG-I ATPase activity does not necessarily ensure immune-stimulatory activity. It has been demonstrated that duplex RNAs containing a 5\u2032 hydroxyl can bind RIG-I and stimulate robust ATP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kohlway et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rawling et al., 2015</a>), yet these RNAs do not induce immune signaling by RIG-I, even at saturating concentrations (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schlee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baum et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goubau et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, RIG-I ATPase activity can be stimulated by short RNAs bearing a 3\u2032 overhang, as seen in miRNA precursors (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schlee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wilson and Doudna, 2013</a>). There are many other cellular RNAs that might be expected to bind RIG-I, such as lncRNAs, which contain abundant stem-loop structures (<a href=\"#bib39\">Somarowthu et al., 2015</a>) and 5\u2032 monophosphorylated products of mRNA decapping (<a href=\"#bib8\">Coller and Parker, 2004</a>). Therefore, a mechanism to discriminate between endogenous and pathogenic RNA must be utilized. The ability to differentiate between host and viral RNA is essential, as aberrant activation of RIG-I would result in unregulated signaling that could lead to auto-inflammation and other innate immune disorders. Thus, elucidating the mechanism for RNA ligand discrimination and understanding its linkage with ATP utilization are central to understanding the induction and regulation of RIG-I signaling."

We show that RNA-stimulated ATP binding can activate RIG-I for immune signaling in the absence of hydrolysis, thus explaining the lack of a correlation between ATP hydrolysis and signaling. Using a novel RNA ligand lacking free ends, we establish that ATP-mediated signal activation requires RNA end capping by the CTD. We demonstrate that in the absence of end capping, ATP binding and hydrolysis promote RIG-I dissociation from RNA rather than signaling, thereby contributing to proofreading and rejection of sub-optimal RNA ligands, such as endogenous RNA. Additionally, we show that ATP-stimulated RNA dissociation is dependent on the CARD domains of RIG-I. We therefore propose a model in which ATP binding by RIG-I leads to conformational changes that can result in either the liberation of the CARDs for signaling or RIG-I dissociation from RNA, depending on the affinity of RIG-I for the bound RNA ligand. ATP binding and hydrolysis thus play important roles in RIG-I function by activating signaling and ensuring RNA target specificity."

                                "text": "To investigate the relationship between ATPase activity and immune signaling in RIG-I, we evaluated the catalytic and signaling capabilities of RIG-I ATPase site mutants. Lysine 270, a conserved residue in the Walker A motif that coordinates ATP (<a href=\"#bib41\">Walker et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yoneyama et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cordin et al., 2006</a>), was mutated to either an alanine or arginine. Mutation of this lysine residue typically abolishes both ATP binding and hydrolysis in related DEAD-box proteins, making mutants at this conserved residue useful for studying the role of ATPase activity. Using a coupled ATPase assay (<a href=\"#bib28\">Luo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kohlway et al., 2013</a>), we determined the steady state ATP hydrolysis activity of RIG-I and the lysine mutants (K270A and K270R) when activated by a 5\u2032 triphosphorylated, 10 bp hairpin (5\u2032ppp10L). In agreement with previous studies on this and similar DExD/H-box proteins, we found that the RNA-stimulated ATPase activity of both mutations was eliminated, while wild type RIG-I activity was robust (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yoneyama et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cordin et al., 2006</a>). Next, we measured the RNA binding affinity of K270A and K270R mutants for a FAM-labeled 10-mer RNA hairpin using fluorescence polarization, and found that both mutants bind RNA with affinities similar to the wild type protein (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Thus, we conclude that the observed ATP hydrolysis deficiencies are not a result of impaired RNA binding by these mutants."

Briefly, HEK 293T cells are transfected with RIG-I or RIG-I mutant and an IFN-\u03b2/firefly luciferase reporter construct, challenged with RNA ligands, and then analyzed for luciferase expression (i.e., IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation) using a luminescence assay. Several concentrations of each protein expression plasmid were transfected prior to dsRNA challenge in order to compare signaling efficiencies across wild type and mutant constructs. Intriguingly, wild type and Walker A mutant RIG-I proteins elicited similar levels of IFN-\u03b2 promotor response at each of three concentrations tested when challenged by the 5\u2032ppp10L hairpin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We performed Western blot analysis on cell lysates from IFN-\u03b2 activation experiments and confirmed that wild type signaling levels for each mutant protein are not due to variable protein expression across the three constructs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We also evaluated IFN-\u03b2 promotor activation when cells were challenged by a vehicle control, and observed no response. We thus determined that the observed IFN-\u03b2 activation requires RNA transfection, and is not the result of high cellular concentrations of RIG-I. Therefore, signaling by the Walker A mutants represents a <i>bona fide</i> response to exogenous RNA, and we conclude that ATP hydrolysis is not required for signaling by RIG-I on a high-affinity RNA ligand."

Given the inability of RIG-I to signal on internal RNA duplexes, we hypothesized that this protein might also use ATPase activity to induce RNA dissociation in order to discriminate between optimal and non-productive RNA binding sites. A mechanism for differentiating target viral RNAs from diverse host RNAs would prevent undesirable induction of antiviral signaling and inflammation by endogenous RNA molecules. To investigate how ATP binding and hydrolysis affect RNA binding, we used fluorescence anisotropy to monitor RIG-I binding to a FAM-labeled 10-mer RNA hairpin alone or when bound to various nucleotides and nucleotide analogs. Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined in the presence of ADP, as well as the analogs ATP\u03b3S and ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub>, which act as mimetics of ATP and the transition state of catalytic hydrolysis respectively (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To ensure that ATP\u03b3S recapitulates interactions formed between RIG-I and ATP, we also determined RNA binding constants for Walker A mutants in the presence of ATP. WT RIG-I and Walker A mutant RIG-I exhibited significant losses in RNA binding affinity in the presence of all nucleotides tested. The most substantial changes in RNA <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> values were observed in the presence of the ATP analog ATP\u03b3S, although interactions with both the transition state analog ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub> and ADP also impaired RNA binding by RIG-I (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Further, ATP and ATP\u03b3S caused nearly identical losses in RNA affinity for both K270A and K270R RIG-I, indicating that ATP\u03b3S is a <i>bona fide</i> ATP mimetic for this system (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

Further, available structural data suggests that RIG-I bound to both RNA and the transition state analog ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub> cannot accommodate the CARDs:HEL2i interaction characteristic of the autorepressed state (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kowalinski et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Luo, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rawling and Pyle, 2014</a>).

Hence, mutation of this residue is expected to significantly weaken ATP binding and abrogate hydrolysis. As expected, RIG-I K270 mutants exhibit no ATP hydrolysis activity. Yet surprisingly, the K270 mutants retain the ability to bind ATP and to engage immune signaling when challenged by an optimized RNA ligand, 5\u2032ppp10L (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kohlway et al., 2013</a>). Just as strikingly, the K270 mutants fail to bind ATP and they fail to induce signaling when bound to longer, suboptimal RNA ligands. Taken together, these data establish that ATP binding plays a critical role in the induction of signaling, and that ATP binding is controlled through simultaneous interactions between RIG-I and its RNA ligands, thereby providing a two-tier system for highly specific response to viral RNA."

Why does this short, high-affinity triphosphorylated RNA ligand uniquely activate the RIG-I protein, and what is the significance of this observation? To answer this question, it is instructive to refer to the published literature on crystal structures of RIG-I complexes with RNA and ATP ligands. It has been reported that ATPase activity of wild type RIG-I is optimally activated by short RNA ligands (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kato et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kohlway et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that these RNAs help \u2018prime\u2019 the protein for interactions with ATP. Many important ATP binding interfaces, such as the Q motif and motif VI (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cordin et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Luo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Luo et al., 2012a</a>), are not perturbed by the K270 mutation, and therefore a strong ATP binding cleft can still be formed if it is reinforced by additional interactions with short RNA ligands. It is likely that the optimized 5\u2032ppp10L ligand compensates for the deficiencies caused by removing lysine 270, pre-organizing the active site for binding to ATP. Intriguingly, many viral genomes are predicted to form short duplex panhandle structures with mismatches, bulges, and loops near the duplex terminus, thereby mimicking the conformational constraints imposed by 5\u2032ppp10L (<a href=\"#bib30\">Luo et al., 2012b</a>)."

It is clear that both of these features allow RIG-I to distinguish between pathogenic RNAs and potential host targets, such as capped RNA, single stranded RNAs, miRNA, or other processed RNAs in which the 5\u2032 triphosphate moiety has been removed. However, the biophysical basis for this discrimination is not clearly understood. Analysis of our functional data and available crystallographic information also explain why RIG-I requires a blunt RNA duplex terminus for signaling. A RIG-I signaling model that involves ATP-mediated domain compaction depends upon a steric collision between the CARDs and the RNA-bound CTD in order to promote CARD expulsion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, Left). Disrupting the CTD:RNA interface is expected to disrupt signaling by preventing this steric clash, and preventing CARD release. The tight binding affinity between the CTD and optimized RNA ligands derives from a complex network of specific interactions with the 5\u2032 triphosphate moiety and stacking interactions with the terminal base pair of an RNA duplex (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jiang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kowalinski et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Luo et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2012b</a>). By contrast, the CTD of RIG-I molecules bound at internal sites is effectively disengaged, and it is likely that all interactions between RIG-I and internal sites occur exclusively through contacts involving the helicase domain (<a href=\"#bib40\">Vela et al., 2012</a>). In such cases, the CTD will not provide a hard barrier for colliding with the CARDS, and these will fail to disengage upon ATP binding and domain compaction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, Right). We tested this model by creating the dumbbell ligand as a model for internal binding by RIG-I, and we observed that wild type RIG-I binds internal duplexes much more weakly than duplex termini. Importantly, RIG-I binds the dumbbell RNA with similar affinity as the isolated helicase domain binds to optimal, terminal duplexes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Vela et al., 2012</a>), consistent with the fact that the CTD is disengaged when RIG-I binds internal sites. Nonetheless, the dumbbell ligand stimulates robust ATPase activity by wild-type RIG-I, indicating that the protein is capable of both binding and hydrolyzing ATP at internal duplexes, but it is incapable of signaling. While the ATP hydrolysis activity is likely to serve an important function (vide infra), the failure of this ligand to induce signaling is consistent with a compaction and collision model that requires a tightly anchored CTD. We therefore conclude that at internal sites, RIG-I binds and hydrolyzes ATP, but the signaling domains remain in their auto-repressed conformation."

If the CTD is engaged in a high-affinity interaction with a triphosphorylated duplex terminus (as in viral RNA), this collision disengages the CARDS from the HEL2i domain, making them available for immune signaling (left).

The proposed \u2018priming\u2019 behavior observed for the 5\u2032ppp10L hairpin could potentially be recapitulated by tightly stacking additional copies of the protein against one another (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), thereby mimicking conformational constraints imposed by the short RNA and enhancing the signaling efficiency of the end-bound RIG-I. For example, we observe a significant and reproducible jump in RIG-I signaling activity when challenged by a 5\u2032ppp50L hairpin compared to the 5\u2032ppp30L hairpin.

RIG-I bound to ATP exhibits reduced equilibrium binding affinity for RNA, and rapid RNA dissociation. Furthermore, the observed enhancement in RNA dissociation kinetics is dependent on the CARDs of RIG-I, which suggests that a collision between the CARDs and the CTD further destabilizes RNA binding by RIG-I. Intriguingly, enhanced dissociation kinetics are observed for all RNAs tested, including those containing a 5\u2032 triphosphorylated duplex terminus. Therefore, ATP-mediated turnover is not specific for a particular RNA ligand. Rather, it challenges and tests the RIG-I:RNA interaction for all ligands, and results in CARDs expulsion only when the CTD is rigidly constrained by high-affinity binding to the terminus of triphosphorylated viral RNAs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

The model presented here mirrors these findings; in both RIG-I and DEAD-box proteins, ATP binding is required for a particular mechanical activity, while ATP hydrolysis is only required to \u2018reset\u2019 the protein, enabling it to search for another target or to engage in another round of activation.

If both ligation events occurred and the dumbbell was formed, the labeling reaction would be unsuccessful as there are no free 5\u2032 ends. In contrast, any impurities (i.e., hairpin or duplex RNA resulting from 1 or no ligation events, respectively) in the sample would be 5\u2032 end labeled. First, samples were treated with Antarctic Phosphatase (New England Biolabs) as per the manufacturer's instructions to remove any 5\u2032 monophosphates. After heat inactivation, 15 pmol of the Antarctic phosphatase treated RNA was incubated with T4 PNK and excess [\u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. To assess purity of the dumbbell in a quantifiable manner, the incorporation efficiency of [\u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P] was determined using a filter spotting technique. Briefly, 1 \u03bcl of the reaction was spotted in duplicate on Whatman DE81 filter papers. One filter was washed by immersion in 25 ml 0.5 M sodium phosphate pH 7.0 buffer for 5 min (four times). After drying, the washed and unwashed filters were exposed on a phosphorimaging screen and scanned using the Typhoon phosphorimager (GE Healthcare). The percent incorporation was then determined by dividing quantified intensity for the washed filter by quantified intensity for the unwashed filter. Using the specific activity of [\u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP, the pmol of RNA labeled was also calculated."

Briefly, RIG-I was pre-incubated with Cy3-labeled hairpin RNA in equimolar amounts (400 nM) at room temperature for 2\u20136 hr to form a protein-RNA complex. The protein-Cy3 RNA complex was then rapidly mixed with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled hairpin RNA for a specified period of time in which 2000 points were collected. For experiments with nucleotide, adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP) (Sigma), adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate (ADP) (Sigma) or adenosine 5\u2032-[\u03b3-thio]triphosphate (ATP\u03b3S) (Sigma) and MgCl<sub>2</sub> were included with the trap RNA and rapidly mixed with the protein-Cy3 RNA complex. The average fluorescence measurements (4\u20136 traces) for each condition were then used in data analysis."

Major questions remain in relation to how RIG-I distinguishes endogenous RNA from viral RNA. In this manuscript, Rawling et al. investigated the importance of ATP binding step in RIG-I activation, using biochemical and cell-based approaches. They examine RNA binding, ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and IFN-\u03b2 activation by RIG-I and the ATPase deficient mutant (K270A/R) upon stimulation by several RNA substrates under different ATP and ATP analog conditions. The authors have found that ATP binding is sufficient to initiate a signaling response in the presence of an optimal RNA ligand. They provide a biochemical mechanism whereby RIG-I can distinguish between self and non-self RNA, and utilize ATP hydrolysis to rapidly recycle itself, thereby enabling RIG-I to sample the RNA milieu rapidly. By using a variety of substrates and ATP analogs the authors determined that RIG-I utilizes ATP hydrolysis to further distinguish between innate RNA and pathogenic RNA. ATP hydrolysis assists in turning over RIG-I when bound to endogenous RNA by stimulating RNA dissociation. This manuscript contains interesting and important observations in the detailed mechanism of RIG-I activation especially ATP binding and exposure of CARDs."

The authors need to establish that these analog indeed mimic ATP and not ADP. Perhaps this has already been established in the literature. If not, then this could be addressed by competition experiments (e.g., ATPase activity), by the stopped-flow experiments (e.g., as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> or 4), or by RNA affinity measurements using the ATPase-dead mutant protein and 5'ppp10L."

The comment applies to all of the values in <a href=\"#tbl1 tbl2\">Table 1 and 2</a> (a particularly egregious example is the binding constant reported as 41.68 +/- 11.16; this number is no better than 41.7 +/- 11, and perhaps 42 +/- 11 is a more realistic value): unless the authors can demonstrate a higher precision, all of the reported values should be reduced to no more than 3 significant figures.

But all nonetheless felt it was critically important to include such experiments with authentic ATP where feasible. Old <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> (now 5) shows equilibrium binding data for two ATP-hydrolysis defective mutants in panels A and C (K270A and K270R); equilibrium data with ATP can unquestionably be obtained for these two mutant proteins, and the interpretation of those binding data will not be encumbered with the complexities of steady-state ATP hydrolysis. In addition, the kinetic experiments in panels B and D can be performed with both WT and mutant protein. The detailed kinetic analysis of the rates and amplitudes for WT protein can be deferred to another paper, but the observed behavior is important to report, relative to the analogs. Again, however, the interpretation of the kinetic behavior of the ATP-hydrolysis defective mutants should be straightforward, given the model and the nil turnover relative to the dissociation time; consequently these results also need to be provided."

Thus we are not consistently seeing better signaling from longer ligands, and while the effect of 5\u2019ppp50L is significant and reproducible, it would not be considered a major effect. However, to address the basis for the higher observed signaling on 5\u2019ppp50L, we would reference previous reports from the Hur and Garcia-Sastre labs, which have shown that the RIG-I protein is capable of forming multimers on longer RNA ligands (<a href=\"#bib33\">Patel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Peisley et al., 2013</a>). Given the small effect we are reporting here, we attribute the higher levels of IFN production induced by a sufficiently long RNA (in this case 5\u2019ppp50L) to local concentration effects that are caused by multimerization of RIG-I on a single RNA ligand (new data shown as <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>)."

Thus, while we appreciate your point, we respectfully disagree that internal duplex RNA is important for signaling.

We have included equilibrium binding constants and dissociation rate constants for experiments performed with the K270A and K270R mutant constructs in <a href=\"#tbl1 tbl2\">Tables 1 and 2</a> respectively. If you believe it is necessary, we can also produce an additional figure supplement showing the quantitated equilibrium binding data and dissociation traces for the mutant proteins (as in <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response images 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">2</a>); however we felt that the inclusion of the measured biophysical constants would be sufficient."
