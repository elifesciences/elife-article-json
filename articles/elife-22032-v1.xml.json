The binocularly-matched orientation preference is established during a critical period in early life, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we optogenetically isolated the thalamocortical and intracortical excitatory inputs to individual layer 4 neurons and studied their binocular matching. In adult mice, the thalamic and cortical inputs representing the same eyes are similarly tuned and both are matched binocularly. In mice before the critical period, the thalamic input is already slightly matched, but the weak matching is not manifested due to random connections in the cortex, especially those serving the ipsilateral eye. Binocular matching is thus mediated by orientation-specific changes in intracortical connections and further improvement of thalamic matching. Together, our results suggest that the feed-forward thalamic input may play a key role in initiating and guiding the functional refinement of cortical circuits in critical period development."

In one, V1 neurons become selective for bars and edges of certain orientations (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ferster and Miller, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1962</a>). In the other, eye-specific thalamic inputs converge onto individual V1 neurons, making them binocularly responsive (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cang and Feldheim, 2013</a>). Combining the two transformations together, V1 neurons are now tuned to similar orientations through the two eyes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bridge and Cumming, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nelson et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2010</a>), a property presumably required for normal binocular perception. Importantly, binocularly-matched orientation tuning is not a necessary consequence of simply combining the two eyes\u2019 inputs. Instead, its establishment requires an active and experience-dependent process that takes place during a critical period in early life (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">2010</a>). However, the circuit and synaptic mechanisms underlying the matching process are still unknown."

According to the \u2018feed-forward\u2019 model proposed by Hubel and Wiesel (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1962</a>), cortical orientation selectivity arises from the convergence of non-selective dLGN relay cells whose receptive fields are spatially aligned to generate larger peak excitation to the postsynaptic cell at its preferred orientation than at other orientations (<a href=\"#bib34\">Priebe and Ferster, 2012</a>). This model is supported by a number of studies, especially in cats, including cross-correlation analysis of functional connectivity between dLGN and V1 neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alonso et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Reid and Alonso, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tanaka, 1983</a>) and studies of visually\u00a0evoked synaptic inputs in layer 4 cells during cortical inactivation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chung and Ferster, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferster et al., 1996</a>). The feed-forward model appears to apply to mice as well, even though more orientation-selective responses are seen in the mouse dLGN than in cats (<a href=\"#bib33\">Piscopo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Scholl et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zhao et al., 2013a</a>). Two recent studies used optogenetic approaches to silence the visual cortex in order to isolate the thalamic excitation that could be recorded by in vivo whole-cell recording (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lien and Scanziani, 2013</a>). The thalamic input to layer 4 neurons was found to be tuned in a manner consistent with the feed-forward model, but not from orientation selective dLGN neurons (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lien and Scanziani, 2013</a>). The tuned thalamic input is further amplified by similarly\u00a0tuned intracortical input, thereby preserving its orientation tuning (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lien and Scanziani, 2013</a>)."

In one, the above feed-forward model could hold true for both contralateral and ipsilateral pathways, where the thalamic and cortical inputs representing the same eyes are similarly tuned and both are binocularly matched. To achieve this scenario, experience-dependent changes for both thalamocortical and intracortical circuits must take place during the critical period to ensure their binocular matching. Alternatively, critical period plasticity may only drive synaptic changes of the intracortical circuits. This would mean that the two eye\u2019s thalamic inputs to layer 4 neurons may still be mismatched in their orientation tuning in adult mice, and the mismatch would be \u2018corrected\u2019 by cortical circuits. In other words, the feed-forward model would not be true for one or both eyes\u2019 thalamocortical transformation for binocular V1 neurons."

We find that both thalamic and cortical inputs are indeed binocularly matched in adult mice, thereby supporting the aforementioned first scenario. Surprisingly, we find that the thalamic input is already slightly matched at the beginning of the critical period, but this weak matching is not manifested due to mismatched cortical inputs. Binocular matching in the critical period is thus mediated by orientation-specific changes in these cortical connections and further improvement of thalamic matching."

To reveal the circuit mechanisms of this binocular orientation matching process, we have now performed in vivo whole-cell recording to examine the subthreshold membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) responses and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) underlying orientation tuning through the two eyes. We focused our experiments on the excitatory neurons in layer 4 because the synaptic mechanisms of their orientation tuning are better understood.

As previously revealed in the monocular visual cortex, the orientation tuning of layer\u00a04 cells is determined by the thalamic input, which is then linearly amplified by intracortical circuits (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lien and Scanziani, 2013</a>). To determine the thalamic contribution to binocular matching, we isolated layer\u00a04 cells\u2019 thalamic input by voltage clamp recording coupled with optogenetic silencing. These experiments were performed in transgenic mice that expressed Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in neurons that express the GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD2. Consequently, by illuminating the exposed visual cortex with blue LED light, we were able to activate the inhibitory neurons and consequently silence the excitatory neurons, thereby allowing us to isolate thalamic excitation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lien and Scanziani, 2013</a>)."

First, LED stimulation was able to completely silence the visually\u00a0evoked responses of neurons recorded as deep as 700 \u00b5m below cortical surface, more than 200 \u00b5m deeper than layer 4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Second, in addition to the inputs from dLGN and local excitatory neurons, layer\u00a04 neurons could potentially receive excitatory inputs from the other hemisphere via callosal projections, which would confound the interpretation of our results. We thus recorded layer\u00a04 spiking activity while silencing the other hemisphere with LED photoactivation. Visually\u00a0evoked responses were in fact unaffected by silencing the other hemisphere (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>), consistent with a previous report that callosal inputs are absent in layer 4 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mizuno et al., 2007</a>). Finally, to determine whether optogenetic activation of the inhibitory interneurons could influence thalamocortical transmission by potentially activating GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors on their axon terminals, we recorded visually\u00a0evoked local field potentials (VEPs) in the visual cortex and examined the effect of administrating GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP54624. In one set of experiments, we first applied the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist Baclofen to reduce the VEP amplitude, which was then reversed by the subsequent administration of CGP (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013H</a>), indicating the effectiveness of the antagonist (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lien and Scanziani, 2013</a>). In another set of experiments, we found that optogenetic silencing of the visual cortex reduced the VEP by\u00a0~ 60 %, and importantly, it was not affected by the administration of CGP (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1I\u2013J</a>). This result thus indicates that thalamocortical transmission was not affected by optogenetic activation of the inhibitory neurons."

The degree of reduction, as measured by the ratio of mean thalamic EPSCs over mean total EPSCs during the visual stimulation across all directions (the \u2018scale factor\u2019), was similar between the responses evoked through contralateral (0.32\u00a0\u00b1 0.05) and ipsilateral eyes (0.32\u00a0\u00b1 0.07; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). Importantly, the thalamic EPSCs and total EPSCs were tuned to similar orientations in adult mice ( <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013F</a>), which is reflected by the small values of orientation preference difference between thalamic and total EPSCs. Furthermore, this difference was similar between contralateral (15.2\u00a0\u00b1 3.4\u00b0) or ipsilateral eye (17.7\u00a0\u00b1 4.5\u00b0) responses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, p = 0.89, K-S test).

The total EPSCs were not yet matched in their orientation preference at this age (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C1</a>), with their inter-ocular difference (\u0394O) quite randomly distributed within the entire range between 0 and 90 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C2</a>, \u0394O\u00a0= 41.4\u00a0\u00b1 5.5\u00b0, n\u00a0= 26, p = 0.023 compared to adult, p = 0.45 compared to random, K-S test). For the thalamic EPSCs, their orientation tuning was not as well matched as in adult mice either (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D1\u2013D2</a>, \u0394O\u00a0= 30.9\u00a0\u00b1 4.0\u00b0, n\u00a0= 26, p = 0.037 compared to adult, K-S test). However, their \u0394O distribution was skewed toward 0 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D2</a>), indicating a certain degree of thalamic matching already present in these mice (p = 0.003 compared to random, K-S test). To better illustrate this, we plotted the \u0394O of total EPSCs against that of thalamic \u0394O for individual cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, r\u00a0= 0.04, p = 0.84, i.e., no correlation between them). There were more cells above the unity line, i.e., smaller \u0394O values for thalamic EPSCs, indicating that the thalamic EPSCs were better matched than total EPSCs at this age (p = 0.038, paired <i>t</i>-test, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Finally, when analyzing the relative strength of the two eyes\u2019 inputs (i.e. ocular dominance), we found that the contralateral EPSCs were about twice stronger than the ipsilateral ones for both thalamic and total inputs, and this ratio remained consistent at both ages (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In other words, the ocular dominance of thalamic and total EPSCs does not undergo any gross change during development when they become binocularly matched."

The lack of adult-level \u2018thalamic-total\u2019 correlation in the young mice suggests that the intracortical circuits are not yet organized in the same manner. To examine the tuning of intracortical excitatory input across development, we did a point-by-point subtraction between thalamic and total EPSCs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This was done for all 12 stimulus directions to determine the tuning curves and orientation preference of intracortical EPSCs ( <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). As expected, the intracortical EPSCs were tuned to similar orientations as the thalamic EPSCs in adults, for both contralateral and ipsilateral eyes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>, \u2018thalamic-cortical difference\u2019: 17.0\u00a0\u00b1 4.4\u00b0 for contralateral pathway and 22.4\u00a0\u00b1 6.0\u00b0 for ipsilateral), thus binocularly matched (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Interestingly, for individual cells, the difference between thalamic and intracortical tuning was greater for the ipsilateral eye than for the contralateral eye (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013G</a>, p = 0.041, paired <i>t</i>-test). As a result, the intracortical input was completely mismatched binocularly in the young mice (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), despite the weak matching of thalamic input. The mismatched intracortical input thus leads to a mismatch in its total excitation and the resulting V<sub>m</sub> and spike responses in mice before the critical period."

Our results reveal two developmental profiles of these circuits. First, the binocular matching of thalamic inputs initiates before that of intracortical circuits. Second, the intracortical circuits serving the contralateral eye mature before those for the ipsilateral eye. In mice before the critical period, the slight binocular matching of thalamic input is not manifested due to random connections in the cortex, especially those serving the ipsilateral eye (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). In adult mice, the thalamic and cortical inputs serving the same eyes are tuned to similar orientations and are both matched binocularly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>), thereby giving rise to normal binocularity.

For example, we previously revealed a sequence of binocular matching during the critical period (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2013</a>): simple cells match before complex cells, with the two classes of cells representing successive stages of visual processing in V1. Here, our new data indicate that this sequence can be extended to the \u2018pre-critical period\u2019 for the matching of thalamocortical projections, and very importantly, at the level of individual cells. Similarly, a developmental maturation sequence of synaptic plasticity has been shown by in vitro studies following the visual pathway, from LGN to layer\u00a04 and then from layer 4 to layer 2/3 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jiang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kirkwood and Bear, 1994</a>), which may underlie some aspects of the functional maturation we observed in vivo."

It is possible that the visual experience between eye opening (P12-14) and our recording time (P15-21) may contribute to this early thalamic binocular correspondence. Alternatively, previous studies have shown that many aspects of visual system organization and function can be established by experience-independent mechanisms, such as ocular dominance columns in cat visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib9\">Crowley and Katz, 2000</a>), monocular orientation selectivity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ko et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2010</a>) and receptive field structures (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sarnaik et al., 2014</a>) in mouse V1. The experience-independent mechanisms could include molecular guidance cues and activity-dependent processes driven by patterned spontaneous activity such as retinal waves (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cang and Feldheim, 2013</a>). Structured spontaneous activities have been observed in the dLGN and visual cortex before vision onset (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ackman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chiu and Weliky, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hanganu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Siegel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Weliky and Katz, 1999</a>). A correlation-based computational study supports the notion that patterned activity could give rise to monocular receptive fields that are consistent with the feed-forward model (<a href=\"#bib28\">Miller, 1994</a>). However, an activity-driven binocular matching of thalamic inputs requires some correlation between the two eye-specific pathways. Amazingly, certain degrees of binocular correlation may indeed exist in mice even at the level of retinal waves (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ackman et al., 2012</a>), possibly via direct retino-retinal connections ( <a href=\"#bib30\">M\u00fcller and Holl\u00e4nder, 1988</a> ), retinopetal modulations (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gastinger et al., 2006</a>), or light-driven activity in the intrinsic photosensitive retinal ganglion cells through the closed eye lids (<a href=\"#bib11\">Delwig et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Renna et al., 2011</a>). Future studies are needed to investigate whether such spontaneous activity is involved in the early binocular matching of thalamic inputs to cortical neurons."

In other words, layer\u00a04 excitatory neurons must be preferentially connected with cortical neurons that prefer similar orientations.

A similar developmental sequence of the two pathways has been revealed in both cat and mouse visual cortices. In mouse ocular dominance plasticity, while both contralateral and ipsilateral circuits respond to imbalanced visual inputs in juveniles (<a href=\"#bib14\">Frenkel and Bear, 2004</a>), only the ipsilateral circuits remain responsive in young adults (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sawtell et al., 2003</a>), suggesting that the ipsilateral pathway reaches maturity later. In cats, visual cortical maps at vision onset are dominated by the contralateral eye and visual experience is needed for the other eye\u2019s response to strengthen (<a href=\"#bib8\">Crair et al., 1998</a>). Given the strong contralateral dominance, it is possible that the contralateral pathway may be used as a \u2018guide\u2019 for ipsilateral development. Consistent with this idea, it has been shown that the refinement of the ipsilateral retinotopic map in the mouse visual cortex can be delayed or accelerated by manipulating the contralateral input (<a href=\"#bib41\">Smith and Trachtenberg, 2007</a>). It is conceivable that a similar interaction between the two pathways exists in binocular matching, where the dominant input may guide the weaker one in rewiring the thalamocortical and intracortical circuits. Future experiments where the matching process can be followed chronically will be needed to test this hypothesis."

This problem is especially severe for dendritic neurons and for in vivo recording, where the series resistance is often higher than in slices. As a result, our measurement likely underestimated the amplitude of EPSCs that layer\u00a04 neurons receive from thalamic and intracortical inputs. Furthermore, the estimation of intracortical EPSCs by linear subtraction could be confounded by potential non-linear interactions between thalamic and cortical inputs. In other words, the exact EPSC amplitudes and their scale factor and ocular dominance ratio may not be accurately reflected in our study. On the other hand, the calculation of preferred directions should not be much affected by this issue, because the EPSC underestimation was likely similar across different directions. Therefore, the main discoveries in our study, i.e., the two developmental profiles which are entirely based on the preferred directions, should hold true despite the limitations of voltage clamp recordings."

When we analyzed CGP\u2019s effect on VEP amplitude in the absence of LED, we found that it was not different between control and CGP conditions. This is in fact consistent with the literature that administration of GABA-B receptor antagonist alone does not affect the field potential amplitudes (Liu et al., 2007; Yamouchi et al., 2000). In other words, GABA-B receptors are not normally active during our recording condition. We have therefore performed new experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the antagonist, following Lien and Scanziani (2013). In this set of experiments, we first applied the GABA-B receptor agonist Baclofen, which reduced the VEP amplitude. Subsequent administration of CGP was able to reverse Baclofen\u2019s effect, thus indicating the effectiveness of the antagonist.
