RecJ, a member of DHH family proteins, is the only 5\u00b4 nuclease involved in the RecF recombination pathway. Here, we report the crystal structures of <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i> RecJ in complex with deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), ssDNA, the C-terminal region of single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB-Ct) and a mechanistic insight into the RecF pathway. A terminal 5\u00b4-phosphate-binding pocket above the active site determines the 5\u00b4-3\u00b4 polarity of the deoxy-exonuclease of RecJ; a helical gateway at the entrance to the active site admits ssDNA only; and the continuous stacking interactions between protein and nine nucleotides ensure the processive end resection. The active site of RecJ in the N-terminal domain contains two divalent cations that coordinate the nucleophilic water. The ssDNA makes a 180\u00b0 turn at the scissile phosphate. The C-terminal domain of RecJ binds the SSB-Ct, which explains how RecJ and SSB work together to efficiently process broken DNA ends for homologous recombination."

RecJ, a member of DHH family proteins, is the only 5\u00b4 nuclease involved in the RecF recombination pathway. Here, we report the crystal structures of <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i> RecJ in complex with deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), ssDNA, the C-terminal region of single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB-Ct) and a mechanistic insight into the RecF pathway. A terminal 5\u00b4-phosphate-binding pocket above the active site determines the 5\u00b4-3\u00b4 polarity of the deoxy-exonuclease of RecJ; a helical gateway at the entrance to the active site admits ssDNA only; and the continuous stacking interactions between protein and nine nucleotides ensure the processive end resection. The active site of RecJ in the N-terminal domain contains two divalent cations that coordinate the nucleophilic water. The ssDNA makes a 180\u00b0 turn at the scissile phosphate. The C-terminal domain of RecJ binds the SSB-Ct, which explains how RecJ and SSB work together to efficiently process broken DNA ends for homologous recombination."

DSBs can be repaired by homologous recombination (HR), which requires a pre-aligned homologous sequence prior to ligation. DNA end resection degrades the 5\u00b4 strand of a DSB end and is one of the earliest and most important processes in HR repair (<a href=\"#bib49\">Symington and Gautier, 2011</a>). In bacteria DSBs are predominantly repaired by either the RecBCD or the RecF pathways. Compared with the RecBCD pathway, the RecF pathway is highly conserved across eubacteria and shows functional homology in the eukaryotic HR process. For example, RecA resembles yeast Rad51 protein with regard to the catalysis of DNA strand invasion and change reactions (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cox and Lehman, 1982</a>). RecO is capable of annealing single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein-coated ssDNA and facilitates RecA loading (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kantake et al., 2002</a>), a property that is shared with the yeast Rad52 protein. The RecBC complex contains both helicase and nuclease activities. In contrast, the RecF pathway requires RecJ, a 5\u00b4-3\u00b4 exonuclease, together with RecQ helicase and SSB protein to initiate DSB end resection (<a href=\"#bib11\">Courcelle and Hanawalt, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Han et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Handa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Morimatsu and Kowalczykowski, 2014</a>)."

In contrast to <i>Escherichia coli</i>, RecBC is naturally absent from <i>D. radiodurans</i>, whereas the key components of the RecF pathway are present. Disruption of <i>recF, recO</i>, or <i>recR</i> significantly sensitized the cells to radiation similar as <i>recA</i> mutant (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bentchikou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ithurbide et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Satoh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Xu et al., 2008</a>), which suggests that the RecF pathway is the dominant HR pathway in <i>D. radiodurans</i>. An extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing process prior to DNA recombination contributes substantially to the rapid restoration of an intact genome (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bentchikou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Slade et al., 2009</a>). It was proposed that RecJ nuclease, which is associated with helicase, rapidly digests the DSB end in a 5\u00b4-3\u00b4 polarity after DNA damage. The resultant 3\u2032-ssDNA overhang subsequently anneals to the complementary DNA strand via RecA- and RadA-mediated strand invasion, followed by extensive DNA synthesis."

RecJ was firstly identified in <i>E. coli</i> by its effect on recombination that cells lacking both RecBCD and RecJ showed extreme recombination deficiency (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lovett and Clark, 1984</a>). In addition to HR, RecJ is involved in ssDNA gap repair, base excision repair and methyl-directed mismatch repair (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burdett et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dianov et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lovett and Kolodner, 1989</a>).

The DHH domain and DHHA1 domain are interconnected by a long linker \u03b1-helix (\u03b115; residues 296\u2013327) to form the nuclease core, as previously observed for the structure of ttRecJ (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yamagata et al., 2002</a>). The overall structure and conformation of the drRecJ complexes can be virtually superimposed on the ttRecJ (PDB code: 2ZXP) with the rmsd value of 1.937\u20132.307\u2009\u00c5 over 476 C\u03b1 atoms (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Although the DHHA1 domain and OB fold domain can be adequately superimposed, the DHH domain and linker \u03b1-helix further shift towards the DHHA1 domain, resulting in a much narrower cleft that accommodates the substrate DNA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The C-terminal domain shows large movement relative to the nuclease core, which is most likely due to the crystal lattice contacts. Three loops, which are located at the OB fold domain, also show noticeable deviations due to interactions with the substrate DNA binding (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Above the active site, the \u03b23-\u03b16 loop, which is disordered in the ttRecJ structures, caps the DNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The C-terminal-most \u03b1-helix (\u03b1-CT) also becomes ordered in all the drRecJ structures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

                                "text": "Recognition of the ssDNA (complex II and III) by the drRecJ is mediated by nuclease core and OB fold domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The DHHA1 domain and the DHH domain bind the 5\u00b4-upstream region of the ssDNA. The two-metal ion active site in the DHH domain stabilizes the scissile phosphate. Three helices \u03b113, \u03b115 and \u03b116 form a helical gateway, which only permits ssDNA passage. The OB fold domain, located directly at the side of the DNA entrance, interacts with the downstream region of the ssDNA. The C-terminal domain, in contrast, is involved in SSB-Ct binding. These DNA binding properties were confirmed by mutagenesis coupled with nuclease assays (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Compared with wild-type protein, the nuclease core of drRecJ exhibits a much decreased nuclease activity and processivity on ssDNA, which indicates that the OB fold domain is critical for substrate DNA binding. However, drRecJ lacking the C-terminal domain (\u0394CTD) also exhibits reduced nuclease activity, which suggests that the C-terminal domain is possibly involved in OB fold domain orientation."

                                "text": "As the representative member of the DHH family proteins, the DHH domain of drRecJ consists of \u03b1/\u03b2 repeats, in which five central parallel \u03b2-strands (\u03b22 to \u03b26 in drRecJ) are surrounded by \u03b1-helices (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The order of the parallel \u03b2-strands is 21345, which is shared by all the DHH family proteins (e.g., NrnA in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Uemura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ugochukwu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yamagata et al., 2002</a>). The signature DHH residues (motif III) are located at the end of the fourth strand. The residues at the end of the first and third \u03b2-strands and the DHH motif coordinate two catalytic metal ions to form the active site (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The arrangement of the catalytic residues appears to be employed by many other nucleases (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). For example, despite the different topology of the \u03b2-strands (32145), the catalytic residues of human flap endonuclease 1 (hFen1) are also located between the end of three central parallel \u03b2-strands (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>). As noted above, subfamily 1 and subfamily 2 DHH family proteins have distinct domains next to the DHH domain, which are denoted DHHA1 and DHHA2, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Both the DHHA1 domain and the DHHA2 domain are structurally similar with a mixed five-stranded central \u03b2-sheet surrounded by \u03b1-helices (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The topologies of the \u03b2-strands, however, are different from DHHA1 (12354, \u2191\u2191\u2193\u2191\u2193) and DHHA2 (12345, \u2191\u2193\u2193\u2191\u2193). In addition, the \u03b21-\u03b22 and \u03b23-\u03b24 strands in the DHHA1 domain have two inserted \u03b1-helices (A and B in RecJ and NrnA, respectively, in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>); in the DHHA2 domain, the \u03b1-helices are located between the \u03b22-\u03b23 and \u03b24-\u03b25 strands (bottom two panels in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In drRecJ, the first (A) \u03b1-helix (\u03b116) of DHHA1 is critical to the composition of the helical gateway (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), which may explain the varying substrate specificity between these two subfamilies."

In both complex II and complex III structures, a positively charged groove between the DHH domain and the DHHA1 domain was observed to bind 5 nt 5\u00b4-upstream ssDNA in the same manner (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Multiple loops located at the interface between the DHH domain and the DHHA1 domain bind the first two nucleotides (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, the helical gateway, which is composed of three \u03b1-helices, primarily binds the +3 to +5 nucleotides (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Ala substitutions of key residues in the helical gateway (Arg280 in \u03b113; Arg313/Arg314 in \u03b115, and Lys353 in \u03b116) reduce the DNA-binding and nuclease activity with multi-stops at 5\u20137 nt (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which suggests that the helical gateway is essential for DNA binding and translocation. The interactions between the nuclease core and DNA phosphate groups are primarily formed by a number of Arg, His, and Asn residues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,D</a>). Notably, four side chain residues form stacking interactions to the 5\u00b4-upstream DNA bases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Tyr114 and Tyr80 (motif I) interact with the +1 base at the active site. The substitution of deoxyribose sugar with ribose sugar clashes with the Tyr114 residue, which is consistent with the notion that drRecJ nuclease only acts on DNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Val224 (motif IV) and Phe269 (motif V) insert between the +2/+3 base and +4/+5 base. Ala substitutions of these two residues also impair the DNA-binding, nuclease activity and processivity of drRecJ (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Five \u03b2-strands (\u03b213 to \u03b217) in the OB fold are orthogonally located to form a mixed \u03b2-barrel (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), which has a Greek topology (12354) that is identical to the topology of other proteins (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernstein et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bochkareva et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Leiros et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Raghunathan et al., 2000</a>). Compared with the canonical OB fold involved in ssDNA binding, the OB fold of drRecJ exhibits certain discrepancies. The L2 loop (\u03b214-\u03b215 loop) is short and the top of the \u03b2-barrel is capped by an additional \u03b1 helix (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Conversely, the bottom \u03b1 helix that connects the L3 loop (\u03b215-\u03b216 loop) is absent in drRecJ (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Ala substitutions of these residues reduce the nuclease activity of drRecJ on both ssDNA and DNA with 5\u00b4-ssDNA overhangs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Notably, Y496A mutant protein exhibits more severely impaired nuclease activity on DNA bearing 5\u00b4-ssDNA overhang compared with ssDNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), suggesting that the OB fold is critical for the drRecJ resection of DNA with 5\u00b4-ssDNA overhang."

Unexpectedly, while drRecJ continuously interacts with the ssDNA (complex III structure, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), the C7 base in the 5\u00b4-ssDNA overhang of complex II is flipped out into the solvent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The flipped out cytosine forms the Watson-Crick base pair with G12, which causes severe bending at approximately 100\u00b0 at the ss-dsDNA junction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This base flipping is most likely attributed to the stacking interaction between Tyr496 and the purine base (G8 in complex II and G7 in complex III; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Poly(dA) and poly(dT) oligomers were synthesized to confirm the interaction between Tyr496 and purine base. Indeed, wild-type drRecJ exhibits approximate 2-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) for the poly(dT) substrate compared to the poly(dA) substrate (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). When Tyr496 is replaced by Ala, the mutant drRecJ has a reduced K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> but is no longer sensitive to the substrate sequence context, confirming the preferred stacking interaction between Tyr496 and purine base."

The thymine base and the deoxyribose are coordinated by Tyr80, Tyr114 and two \u03b2-strands (\u03b210 and \u03b211) from the DHHA1 domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). The phosphate group of the dTMP is held in place by Arg109, Arg280 (motif V), Ser371 and Arg373 (motif VI; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This mononucleotide-binding pocket is situated immediately above the active site, which is consistent with the translocation of the DNA by one nucleotide required for the exonuclease activity to proceed. Mutations of the binding pocket dramatically impair the enzymatic activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The catalytic center of the complex I consists of two metal ions and two bridging ligands, a water molecule and the side chain of Asp135 (motif II; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These two metal ions are bound by five aspartate residues and one histidine: one metal ion (A) is coordinated by Asp83 (motif I), Asp135, Asp223 (motif IV) and His159 (motif III), whereas Asp79, Asp81 (motif I) and Asp135 are the ligands to the other metal ion (B; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Alanine substitutions of these metal-binding residues caused an almost complete inactivation of drRecJ (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which is consistent with the results of equivalent mutations in ecRecJ (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sutera et al., 1999</a>).

The DNA scissile phosphate in drRecJ-DNA is centered on two Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions and the A site metal ion seems to be in a position on the nucleophile side (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The deoxyribonucleioside in complex I occupies almost the same place as the +1 nucleotide observed in drRecJ-DNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Despite of the slightly movements, the coordination of the two catalytic metal ions is almost identical, except for an additional coordination between the A site metal ion and a water molecule (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). This water molecule is located directly below the scissile phosphate at a distance of 3.3\u2009\u00c5 and is a probable nucleophile candidate for the nucleophilic attack. However, the angle between the water, scissile phosphate and 3\u00b4-O leaving group is ~115 degree (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), which explains the inactivity of the drRecJ-DNA complex. This DNA conformation is possibly attributed to the Ala substitution of His160, which most likely serves as the general base essential for catalysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Alanine substitutions of the conserved His160 and Asp158, which is hydrogen bonded to His160 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,E</a>), inactivate drRecJ nuclease activity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which suggests that the DHH motif is critical for the catalysis. In addition, His397 from \u03b210 undergoes a substantial rotamer change during DNA binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). This residue, which is located opposite to the direction of the nucleophilic attack in drRecJ-DNA complex, is hydrogen bonded to the oxygen atom of the scissile phosphate group (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). Alanine substitution of His397 drastically reduced the rate of the drRecJ-catalyzed reaction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), suggesting that this residue may serve as a general acid to protonate the 3\u00b4-O leaving group."

Clear electron density was observed as the last four residues of SSB-Ct peptide (residues 298\u2013301, ED<span class=\"underline\">DLPF</span>) used for co-crystallization. In contrast, the first two residues (Glu296 and Asp297) of the SSB-Ct appear to be disordered. Three helices \u03b120, \u03b121 and \u03b123 form the SSB-Ct peptide-binding site, which anchors the last SSB-Ct residue (Phe301) in a deep hydrophobic pocket (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The aromatic Phe side chain is packed against Pro553, Pro628 and the side chains of Met557, Val572, Tyr575 and Tyr600 from drRecJ (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Moreover, Asp298 of SSB-Ct forms an apparent ionic bond with the Lys629 side chain, which composes an electropositive patch near the N-terminus of SSB-Ct (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These SSB-Ct binding site features are similar to those found in the ribonuclease HI SSB-Ct binding site and appears to be shared by other SSB partner proteins (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Marceau et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Petzold et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ryzhikov et al., 2011</a>). Y575A mutant drRecJ (RecJ<sub>575</sub>), wild-type drSSB (SSB<sub>WT</sub>) and drSSB, which lacks eight C-terminal residues (SSB<sub>\u0394C</sub>), were purified to confirm the interactions between the SSB-Ct domain and the C-terminal domain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). drRecJ or RecJ<sub>575</sub> alone can not process DNA with a 3\u00b4-ssDNA overhang (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, lanes 2\u20133 and 8\u20139), which is consistent with previous biochemical observations of ecRecJ (<a href=\"#bib36\">Morimatsu and Kowalczykowski, 2014</a>). For wild-type drRecJ, this nuclease activity is enhanced by SSB<sub>WT</sub> (lanes 4\u20135) but not by SSB<sub>\u0394C</sub> (lanes 6\u20137). In contrast, neither SSB<sub>WT</sub> (lanes 10\u201311) nor SSB<sub>\u0394C</sub> (lanes 12\u201313) stimulate the RecJ<sub>575</sub> resection of DNA with a 3\u00b4-ssDNA overhang substantially, indicating that the interactions between drRecJ and drSSB are required for the stimulation of drRecJ resection of DNA with a 3\u00b4-ssDNA overhang. For ssDNA, the stimulation is similar to that of the resection of the DNA with a 3\u00b4-ssDNA overhang, suggesting that the SSB-RecJ interaction is required for RecJ to resect SSB-covered ssDNA (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The core of the DHH domain, which consists of a central five parallel \u03b2-strands sandwiched by surrounding \u03b1 helices, appears to be shared by many other nucleases.

More importantly, the DHH domain of the subfamily 1 group faces the C-terminal three \u03b2-strands of DHHA1 to form the DNA binding site (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), whereas the active site of the subfamily 2 group is formed between the DHH domain and the first \u03b2-strand of DHHA2 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>).

In eukaryotes, CDC45, the Mcm2-7 helicase and GINS proteins form the CMG complex, which is involved in DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib35\">Miller et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pacek et al., 2006</a>). Recent studies revealed that CDC45 may guard the gate of Mcm2/5 helicase and capture the errant leading strand (<a href=\"#bib39\">Petojevic et al., 2015</a>). Based on sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction and our drRecJ structures (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we provide a possible mechanism of CDC45 binding ssDNA. CDC45 exhibits sequence homology to the drRecJ DHH domain, which possesses five conserved motifs. However, three key residues (Asp79, Asp135 and His159 in drRecJ) that coordinate catalytic metal ions are not conserved in CDC45, which is consistent with the inactivation and the absence of metal ion in purified CDC45 proteins (<a href=\"#bib26\">Krastanova et al., 2012</a>). Second, residues that compose the terminal 5\u00b4-phosphate-binding pocket (Arg109, Ser371 and Arg373 in drRecJ) are missing in CDC45, which may explain the opposite 3\u00b4-5\u00b4 DNA binding polarity of CDC45 compared with RecJ (<a href=\"#bib50\">Szambowska et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, DNA binding for RecJ is metal ion independent (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Han et al., 2006</a>). The residues involved in protein-DNA stacking interactions (Tyr114, Val224 and Phe269 in drRecJ) and the helical gateway (Arg280, R313, R314 and Lys353 in drRecJ) are conserved in CDC45, which suggests that the DNA binding of CDC45 is possibly similar to that of RecJ."

First, the terminal of ssDNA is anchored to the 5\u00b4-phosphate binding pocket above the active site, which explains the RecJ hydrolyzing DNA with 5\u00b4-3\u00b4 polarity. This terminal 5\u00b4-phosphate-binding pocket appears to be shared by other 5\u00b4-3\u00b4 exonucleases such as the \u03bb exonuclease (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>), XrnI (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jinek et al., 2011</a>) and RNaseJ (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhao et al., 2015</a>). Second, the active site encloses a single deoxyribonucleioside, which renders RecJ an exonuclease discriminating DNA over RNA. Third, the entrance to the RecJ active site is guarded by the helical gateway, which prevents dsDNA from entering the active site. Fourth, a number of residues form stacking interactions with every two DNA bases. Biochemically, the end resection by the RecJ nuclease is processive. Alanine substitution of these residues resulted in multiple intermediate digestion bands, which indicates that the protein-DNA staking interactions are required for the mechanism of processivity of the RecJ nuclease. Fifth, the OB fold domain is located on the side of the DNA entrance, which positions the downstream DNA towards the active site."

Mechanistically, RecJ is required to locally melt dsDNA and bind to the consequential 5\u00b4-ssDNA for the resection. Our analyses suggest that both the nuclease core and the OB fold domain contribute to the RecJ resection of DNA that bears a 5\u00b4-ssDNA overhang. In addition to the reduced nuclease activity and processivity, the mutation of the key residues involved in nuclease core-DNA interactions showed strong reaction-stops at the ss-dsDNA junction (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), which suggests that the complete processivity is essential for the RecJ resection of DNA with a 5\u00b4-ssDNA overhang. On the other hand, the OB fold domain is located at the ss-dsDNA junction. Ala substitution of Tyr496 impaired the nuclease activity against DNA with 5\u00b4-ssDNA overhang and ssDNA, but to a lesser extent, which indicates that the OB fold domain is also critical for this type of end resection. Interestingly, stacking interaction between Tyr496 and a purine base appears to be preferred, which may also be important for the dsDNA melting."

In summary, after deprotonation, a water molecule serves as the nucleophile poised on the 5\u00b4-side to attack the scissile phosphate. After bond breakage, His397, which is located at the opposite side of the nucleophilic attack, stabilizes the 3\u00b4-O leaving group. The resultant mononucleotide and one or both metal ions can be directly exported through the exit tunnel (Arg393). The newly exposed 5\u00b4-phosphate, which is generated in each cycle of the exonuclease reaction, further translocates into the terminal 5\u00b4-phosphate-binding pocket, making the next nucleotide ready for the cleavage. RecJ is able to digest DNA that contains abasic sites (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dianov et al., 1994</a>); this binding pocket is located right above the active site, which indicates that the attraction of 5\u00b4-phosphate to this binding pocket helps to accurately position the scissile phosphodiester bond of the DNA substrate in the active site."

                                "text": "<i>D. radiodurans</i> is capable of surviving high doses of ionizing radiation, which shatters its genome into several hundred fragments. The resulting numerous DSBs can be rapidly repaired by its super-efficient RecA-mediated DNA repair system (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bentchikou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Slade et al., 2009</a>). The functional RecF pathway is required for the RecA-mediated DSB repair in vivo, as <i>D. radiodurans</i> naturally lacks RecB and RecC enzymes. <i>E. coli</i> has a minimum of three 5\u00b4-3\u00b4 exonucleases (RecJ, RecBCD and ExoVII), whereas RecJ is the only 5\u00b4-3\u00b4 exonuclease in <i>D. radiodurans</i>, which plays an essential role in DSB end resection (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lovett, 2011</a>). In contrast to the use of Mg<sup>2+</sup> for DNA digestion by ecRecJ, Mn<sup>2+</sup> appears to be preferred for drRecJ catalysis. This metal-ion preference may be attributed to the following two properties: First, the ionic radius of Mn<sup>2+</sup> is similar to that of Mg<sup>2+</sup> but with less-rigid coordination requirements (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harding, 2000</a>), making it suitable for His159 coordination. In fact, only one Mg<sup>2+</sup> was observed in crystal form that contains Mg<sup>2+</sup> instead of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (unpublished data), which is consistent with the extremely low drRecJ nuclease activity in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Second, Daly and co-workers noted that <i>D. radiodurans</i> contained about 300 times more intracellular Mn<sup>2+</sup> than that in <i>E. coli</i>, which plays a critical role in reactive oxygen species detoxification and protein protection (<a href=\"#bib13\">Daly et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Daly, 2009</a>). Thus, the Mn<sup>2+</sup> preference of drRecJ may also be an example of the evolution adaptation. Indeed, in <i>D. radiodurans</i>, many enzymes involved in DNA repair (e.g., PolI, PolX) prefer to use Mn<sup>2+</sup> for catalysis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Heinz and Marx, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lecointe et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zhao et al., 2015</a>), which indicates that the accumulation of Mn<sup>2+</sup> may also contribute to the robust DSB repair."

                                "text": "Importantly for the efficient HR, the DSB with different end structures must be promptly processed. Our structures and biochemical data are consistent with the helicase-nuclease coordination end resection mechanism (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) and suggest that the extended C-terminal domain of drRecJ, which is absent in <i>E. coli</i>, is critical for its efficient end resection in <i>D. radiodurans</i>. The C-terminal domain can enhance the nuclease activity of drRecJ in vitro (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), which suggests that drRecJ may exhibit a more effective nuclease activity in <i>D. radiodurans</i>. In addition to ssDNA, drRecJ alone is able to initiate DNA end resection with 5\u00b4-ssDNA overhangs processively. Interestingly, drSSB stimulates drRecJ resection of DNA that bears a 3\u00b4-ssDNA overhang to a certain extent in vitro, possibly via the direct interaction between the drRecJ C-terminal domain and SSB-Ct, which suggests that drRecJ together with drSSB might be capable of processing this type of DSB end structure in vivo. On the other hand, SSB in <i>E. coli</i> recruits RecO protein to ssDNA through SSB-Ct. drRecO does not interact with SSB-Ct (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ryzhikov et al., 2011</a>), which suggests the existence of alternative pathway of HR initiation in <i>D. radiodurans</i>. drRecQ further stimulates the reaction, which indicates that the 3\u00b4-5\u00b4 helicase activity is also required for the efficient end resection. However, we found no evidence for the direct interaction between drRecJ and drRecQ, which suggests that other redundant helicases (e.g., UvrD) may also assume the unwinding responsibilities in vivo (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bentchikou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ithurbide et al., 2015</a>)."

For wild-type drRecJ, this nuclease activity is enhanced by SSB<sub>WT</sub> (lanes 4-5) but not by SSB<sub>\u0394C</sub> (lanes 6-7). In contrast, neither SSB<sub>WT</sub> (lanes 10-11) nor SSB<sub>\u0394C</sub> (lanes 12-13) substantially stimulate the RecJ<sub>575</sub> resection of ssDNA to SSB<sub>WT</sub> level. These results are consistent with the drRecJ resection of DNA with a 3\u2032-ssDNA overhang, which indicates that the SSB-RecJ interaction is also required for RecJ to digest SSB-covered ssDNA. A mention to this was made in the revised version text. \u201cFor ssDNA, the stimulation is similar to that of the resection of the DNA with a 3\u00b4-ssDNA overhang, suggesting that the SSB-RecJ interaction is required for RecJ to resect SSB-covered ssDNA (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).\u201d The Methods section has been updated as well."

Actually, the stimulation of drRecJ-mediated resection of 3\u2032-overhang DNA depends on the SSB concentrations (please see gel below) that high concentrations of SSB protein could drastically stimulate this type of the resection even in the absence of RecQ protein. We think the possible explanation is that high concentrations of drSSB could remove DNA secondary structures (dsDNA) and facilitate drRecJ resection. So, we decided to use relatively low concentration of SSB to conduct the nuclease assays of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> to check the RecQ-effect on the resection.
