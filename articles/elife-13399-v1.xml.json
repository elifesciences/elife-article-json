Here, we identified the embryonic neuroblast origin of the adult neuronal lineages in the ventral nervous system via lineage-specific GAL4 lines and molecular markers. Our lineage mapping revealed that neurons born late in the embryonic phase show axonal morphology and transcription factor profiles that are similar to the neurons born post-embryonically from the same neuroblast. Moreover, we identified three thorax-specific neuroblasts not previously characterized and show that HOX genes confine them to the thoracic segments. Two of these, NB2-3 and NB3-4, generate leg motor neurons. The other neuroblast is novel and appears to have arisen recently during insect evolution. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of neurogenesis and show how proliferation of individual neuroblasts is dictated by temporal and spatial cues."

These two life stages look and behave differently and appear to have strikingly different nervous systems. The relationship between the two nervous systems has been most extensively studied in the ventral nerve cord (which is the equivalent to the spinal cord in humans). Although the ventral nerve cords of a larva and an adult fly look quite different, they are generated by the same set of stem cells known as neuroblasts. This is made possible because the neuroblasts proliferate in two separate phases: the first phase occurs in the embryo to generate the neurons of the larval nervous system, and the second phase occurs in the larva to generate neurons for the adult\u2019s nervous system."

This involved identifying the original neuroblasts that gave rise to each of the neurons in both larval and adult fruit flies. The results suggest that most neurons that arise from a given neuroblast produce a similar set of molecules and extend similar nerve fibers, even though they work in two different nervous systems. Since neuroblasts in non-metamorphosing insects proliferate continuously, these findings also suggest that, when metamorphosis evolved, a pause was introduced to create the two separate phases of proliferation without a big effect on the types of neurons generated."

The experiments reveal that the presence of these neuroblasts depended on specific genes that control the development of animal body plans. Two of these neuroblasts generate the so-called motor neurons that control the movement of a fly\u2019s legs. Flies only have legs on their thoracic segments, so this indicates that the development of new neurons is coordinated with the development of the body plan at the stem cell level. The third neuroblast generates neurons that connect with the leg motor neurons, and Lacin and Truman propose that this neuroblast arose from a copy of a neighboring stem cell. The resulting extra neurons may have enabled finer control over the leg movements required for activities such as walking and grooming."

Patterning of the neural ectoderm is the first step in promoting neuronal diversity. The orthogonal interaction of segment-polarity genes [e.g., <i>runt (run), wingless (wg)</i> and <i>gooseberry (gsb)</i>] and columnar genes [e.g., <i>ventral nervous system defective (vnd), intermediate neuroblasts defective</i> (<i>ind</i>), and <i>muscle specific homeobox</i> (<i>msh;</i> also referred to as Drop)] divides the neuroectoderm into a Cartesian grid system, in which each NB acquires a unique identity based on its position within the grid (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib76\">Skeath, 1999</a>). About 30 distinct NBs form in a segmentally repeated bilateral pattern through most of the VNC segments, although the number of NBs is reduced in the anterior gnathal and terminal abdominal segments (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bossing et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schmidt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Technau et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Birkholz et al., 2013</a>). Each NB undergoes multiple rounds of asymmetric cell division. During each division it renews itself and generates a secondary precursor cell, called a ganglion mother cell (GMC), which terminally divides to generate a pair of neurons or glia (<a href=\"#bib20\">Campos-Ortega, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Goodman and Doe, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Rhyu et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Spana et al., 1995</a>). Through successive cell divisions, the number of which depends on the NB identity, each NB produces unique and highly diverse progeny (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bossing et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schmidt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">1999</a>). Recent studies have shown that many NBs in the embryonic VNC undergo the following temporal changes of the transcription factor expression: Hunchback \u2192 Kruppel\u2192 Pdm\u2192 Castor (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kambadur et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Brody and Odenwald 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Isshiki et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Pearson and Doe 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Grosskortenhaus et al. 2005</a>). Each of these factors defines a temporal identity window for the NB, and each is maintained in the GMC, establishing different transcriptional states. The GMC then divides via Notch-mediated asymmetric cell division to produce two sibling cells with distinct identities: the Notch-ON \u201cA\u201d cell and the Notch-OFF \u201cB\u201d cell (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib38\">Jan and Jan, 2000</a>). Consequently, diversity within a NB lineage is produced through two main mechanisms: transcriptional changes in the NB that occur as the stem cell divides and Notch mediated asymmetric cell fates of the daughters of the GMC."

                        "text": "Towards the end of embryogenesis, most NBs in the thoracic and gnathal segments enter a mitotically quiescent state, whereas most NBs in the abdominal segments and a few in the thoracic segments die through apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib65\">Peterson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Cenci and Gould, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Baumgardt et al., 2009</a>). The quiescent NBs re-enter the cell cycle at the beginning of the second larval instar stage and continue to generate progeny from the Castor (Cas) window (<a href=\"#bib83\">Tsuji et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Maurange et\u00a0al., 2008</a>). This quiescent state divides the neurogenesis of <i>Drosophila</i>, and other insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, into two phases: an embryonic phase, which generates the neurons of the larval nervous system, and a postembryonic phase, which generates adult-specific neurons. Because of the NB quiescence and the anatomical changes that occur in the CNS during late embryogenesis, it has been difficult to establish the correspondence between the embryonic and postembryonic lineages. Recently, using the technique of Flybow, <a href=\"#bib10\">Birkholz et al. (2015)</a> reported the correspondence between the embryonic and postembryonic lineages. We attempted a similar linkage using a suite of genetic and molecular tools to identify individual NB lineages in the embryo and then used these tools to bridge the postembryonic lineages to their embryonic origins. While we have concordance with most of the findings of <a href=\"#bib10\">Birkholz et al. (2015)</a>, we differ on eight of the lineages. We also find that within a lineage, the postembryonically born neurons show significant similarities to neurons that are born in the embryonic Cas window in terms of axonal projection and transcription-factor expression. Moreover, our findings complete previous work on identifying embryonic and postembryonic progeny of NBs by characterizing thorax-specific NBs, NB2-3 and NB3-4, which produce leg motor neurons and identifying a novel NB, NB5-7. Our complete lineage map, and the reagents we generated to follow individual lineages throughout development, lay the groundwork for investigating how neural patterning and NB identity in the embryonic CNS direct the formation of neural circuits in the adult."

To use this technique (which we call here \u201creporter immortalization\u201d), we visually screened publicly available databases (<a href=\"#bib53\">Manning et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kvon et al., 2014</a>) to identify GAL4 lines whose reporter expression is restricted to one or a few embryonic NBs. We identified over 100 such GAL4 lines. Only a few of them marked an individual NB, while most marked a few NBs with or without their progeny (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). To identify which NB lineages are marked by these GAL4 lines, we generated random lineage clones for each line (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lacin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Nern et al., 2015</a>) and compared their morphology and molecular-marker expression to previously published embryonic neuronal lineages (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bossing et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schmidt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Birkholz et al., 2013</a> and references therein).

In the late embryonic CNS, Dpn staining, which marks all NBs, shows the same \u201c3+1\u201d pattern, suggesting that these NBs generate the dorsal postembryonic lineages (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). A Dichaete (D)-expressing NB is always located medially in the anterior NB triplet. We identified this NB as NB2-4 based on morphological and molecular criteria: it is marked by <i>eagle (eg</i>)-GAL4, <i>mirror</i>-lacz and Msh (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and not shown), which are co-expressed in NB2-4 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Higashijima et al, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Broadus et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Isshiki et al., 1997</a>). The morphology of lineage clones from this NB also matches the previously published features of the NB2-4 lineage: dorsolateral location, presence of a motor neuron with contralateral projection across the Anterior Commissure (AC) and into the anterior root of the Intersegmental Nerve (ISN), and the presence of interneurons that bundle with this motor neuron to cross the midline. (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,J</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schmidt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">1999</a>). R65G02-GAL4 marks NB2-4 and occasionally a couple other NBs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and not shown). Reporter immortalization of the progeny of NB2-4 consistently labels lineage 18 (21 of 30 hemisegments) showing that NB2-4 generates lineage 18 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In addition, D and Msh coexpress in NB2-4 embryonically and in NB 18 postembryonically. Moreover, Unc-4 expression marks both the embryonic progeny of NB2-4 and the postembryonic neurons of lineage 18 (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lacin et al., 2014b</a>). Finally, lineage 18 is missing from T1 (<a href=\"#bib82\">Truman et al., 2004</a>), and NB2-4 disappears from the anterior triplet by late embryogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Our conclusion that NB2-4 is the parent NB for lineage 18 differs from <a href=\"#bib10\">Birkholz et al. (2015)</a>, who concluded NB3-4 generates lineage 18. The embryonic lineage clone that was used in their study to link NB3-4 to lineage 18 appears to be a partial NB2-4 clone that lacks early-born motor neurons. <a href=\"#bib10\">Birkholz et al. (2015)</a> identified lineage 8 as the postembryonic progeny of NB2-4. However, our findings based on lineage tracings and molecular markers show that the neurons of lineage 8 arise from NB3-3 (see below)."

Since NBs appear to retain their relative positions between stage-16 embryos and larval stages (e.g., dorsal NBs in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), we expected that the postembryonic progeny of NB1-1 would lie medial to NB1-2 progeny (lineage 1). Lineage 16 resides medial to lineage 1 (<a href=\"#bib82\">Truman et al., 2004</a>), and in agreement with this, we found that embryonic interneurons from NB1-1 express Hb9 and Lim3 and extend their axons laterally in a similar manner to lineage 16 postembryonic interneurons that are also Hb9<sup>+</sup> Lim3<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Moreover, using NB-specific GAL4 lines we had assigned all of the surrounding NBs to other postembryonic lineages. Thus, we concluded that NB1-1 generates lineage 16. With a similar strategy we identified lineage 6 as the postembryonic progeny of NB5-2. We found that both NB5-2 embryonic progeny and lineage 6 neurons express En, Twin of eyeless (Toy), and Vestigial (Vg), and their axons use the same routes in the posterior commissures to cross the midline (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

Indeed, NB5-6 is eliminated by apoptosis during embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baumgardt et al., 2009</a>), and a similar fate was concluded for NB7-3 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Karcavich and Doe, 2005</a>). To verify these findings and determine the fates of the other NBs, we surveyed the VNC by TUNEL staining, which marks dying cells. In the thoracic segments, NB7-3, NB6-4 and NB5-6 were TUNEL-positive in stage-14, -15 and -16 embryos, respectively, and could no longer be found in stage-17 embryos (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C\u2013G</a>; not shown). Hence, these three NBs die late in embryogenesis. Further, while we detected NB5-1 and NB5-5 in stage-13 embryos by <i>gsb</i>-lacZ and/or <i>unplugged (unpg)</i>-lacZ expression, we could not identify them at stage 17 (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a> and not shown). However, we did not observe any TUNEL staining in either NB. Either they died and we missed their TUNEL-positive window, or they lost their progenitor and underwent terminal differentiation as is seen in some of the other NBs at the end of their postembryonic phase (<a href=\"#bib55\">Maurange et al., 2008</a>)."

This conclusion is supported by our detection of the Ems protein, which marks embryonic NB3-3 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hartmann et al., 2000</a>), in the NB of lineage 8 and the presence of common transcription factors in both embryonic progeny of NB3-3 and postembryonic lineage 8 neurons (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In addition, the axonal morphology of thoracic NB3-3 embryonic progeny is virtually identical to the morphology of postembryonic lineage 8 neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1L</a>). Thus, we concluded NB3-3 generates lineage 8 neurons. This designation differs from <a href=\"#bib10\">Birkholz et al. (2015)</a> who concluded that NB2-4 was the progenitor of lineage 8.

We immortalized R10C12 expression in its progeny and found that this NB generates lineage 15, which is composed of a large number of leg motor neurons and glial cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). To find the identity of this NB, we assayed a panel of molecular markers and found that <i>mirror</i>-lacZ, Runt, and Msh label this NB (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; not shown). Based on previous studies, NB2-3 is the only NB that delaminates from Msh<sup>+</sup> neuroectoderm and expresses mirror-lacZ and Runt (<a href=\"#bib26\">Doe, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Broadus et al, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Dormand and Brand, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Isshiki et al., 1997</a>). Also, the NB marked by R10C12 typically resided in row two and column three of the NB layer (Supp. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Little is known about NB2-3 and its progeny, but it was previously suggested that it produced leg motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib71\">Schmid et al., 1999</a>). Two previous studies attempted to find embryonic progeny of NB2-3 via DiI labeling; both experienced difficulties and observed unusual rates of cell death (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schmidt et al, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">1999</a>). One study was able to label NB2-3 progeny only in the thoracic segments and showed that NB2-3 progeny comprise a few extraordinarily large cells without axons (9 microns in diameter) and a few interneurons with contralateral projections (<a href=\"#bib71\">Schmid et al., 1999</a>). To visualize NB2-3 embryonic progeny with a less invasive approach, we generated lineage clones with R10C12 and three additional independent lines (R11B05, R28H10 and R77B09<sup>AD</sup>-R28H10<sup>DBD</sup>), all of which label NB2-3. We recovered lineage clones containing this NB only from the thoracic segments (n&gt;50). The largest clones, presumably the entire embryonic lineage, contained 10 cells in addition to the NB (n=8), and the only axonal projection was into the periphery unlike the previously documented NB2-3 progeny (<a href=\"#bib71\">Schmid et al., 1999</a>). These axons exited the CNS in two bundles via the segmental nerve but did not innervate any muscles in stage-17 embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We obtained similar-looking clones with pan-neuronal <i>elav</i>-GAL4, indicating that embryonic progeny of NB2-3 extend only efferent axons (n=3; not shown). Like postembryonic lineage 15 neurons, NB2-3 embryonic progeny express Lim3, Isl and Nkx6. <a href=\"#bib10\">Birkholz et al. (2015)</a> identified NB3-2 as the progenitor of lineage 15, but NB3-2 does not express Msh, whereas NB2-3 in the embryo and lineage 15 NB in the larva do both express Msh (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A, L</a>)."

It also appeared in MARCM clones generated with <i>elav</i>-GAL4 and <i>actin</i>-GAL4 lines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L,M</a>; not shown). At the wandering larval stage, lineage 25 is located lateral to lineage 15 (NB2-3), and includes the NB, a small cluster of closely adhering cells expressing Msh, and two motor neurons expressing Nkx6 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I,L, and M</a>). It is similar to lineage 15 in several ways: (i) neurons in both postembryonic lineages extend their axons towards leg discs, indicating they are leg motor neurons (not shown); (ii) both lineages contain glial cells located around the leg neuropil (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,K</a>); and (iii) both NBs express Msh and Runt (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>; not shown). To find the embryonic origin of lineage 25, we generated lineage clones in the embryo with the lines mentioned above. Common to all lines, we identified a thoracic specific NB, which is located ventrolaterally. For example, reporter immortalization of R77B09<sup>AD</sup>-R28H10<sup>DBD</sup> results in lineage 15 and more laterally lineage 25 in addition to medially residing lineage 2 neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,I</a>; lineage 2 not shown). Based on the lineage clones generated with this line in the embryonic CNS, we found that R77B09<sup>AD</sup>-R28H10<sup>DBD</sup> marks NB2-1 (the stem cell for lineage 2; not shown), NB2-3 (stem cell for lineage 15; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>), and a more lateral NB (the stem cell for lineage 25; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,G</a>). The lateral NB had five progeny in their lineage clones and their axons exit the CNS in the segmental nerve but do not extend as far as the NB2-3 motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). This NB and its progeny in the embryo expressed Msh, Runt, Eg, and Eyless (Ey) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>; not shown), and it was the only NB found in common to all of the GAL4 lines whose reporter immortalization marks lineage 25 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5I</a>,<a href=\"#fig7\">7J-K</a>; not shown). Hence, we concluded that it is the stem cell of lineage 25."

                                        "text": "The embryonic designation of this stem cell was difficult to determine because no NB expressing Msh, Runt, Eg, and Ey and giving rise to progeny with this morphology, has been reported (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schmidt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Birkholz et al., 2013</a>). Among these transcription factors, Eg has been used in many studies because it marks only four NBs: NB2-4, NB3-3, NB6-4, and NB7-3 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Higashijima et al, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dittrich et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mettler et al. 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib83\">Tsuji et al., 2008</a>). However, when we analyzed <i>eg</i>-lacZ, eg-Gal4, or Eg protein expression in the nerve cords of stage-12 embryos, when NB delamination was complete, we observed four Eg<sup>+</sup> NBs in abdominal segments, but five such NBs in the thoracic segments (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B-C</a>). The extra Eg<sup>+</sup> NB in the thorax is the lineage 25 stem cell, since it is also labeled by Msh, Runt, and Ey (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>; not shown). This NB resides in the third row and third column of the thoracic NB array. This position is perplexing because we find NB3-3, which is characterized by being Msh<sup>-</sup> and Eg<sup>+</sup>, in the fourth position in the third row of the thoracic array, although it occupies the third position in the abdominal array (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Although misplaced, we propose this thoracic-specific NB is NB3-4 because: (i) NB3-4 is the only NB in the vicinity that has not been well characterized, and previous studies failed to identify its progeny with confidence (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schmidt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">1999</a>); and (ii) in both abdominal and thoracic segments, only three NBs reside near but lateral to NB3-3: the Msh<sup>+</sup> NBs 2\u20134 and NB2-5, and the EMS<sup>+</sup> NB3-5, indicating that NB3-4 cannot be lateral to NB3-3. Earlier studies may have confused NB3-3 and NB3-4 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Doe, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Higashijima et al., 1996</a>). In agreement with our findings, a recent study in <i>T. castaneum</i> identified an Msh<sup>+</sup> NB in the third row and third column of the NB array in the thoracic segments. However, the authors identified this NB as NB3-3 and explained the discrepancy in Msh expression as a difference between two species (<a href=\"#bib8\">Biffar and Stollwerk, 2015</a>). Since lineage 25 is first described here, <a href=\"#bib10\">Birkholz et al. (2015)</a> did not attempt to identify its stem cell; however, they assigned NB3-4 as the progenitor of lineage 18 based on a Flybow lineage clone that appears to be a partial NB2-4 clone (<a href=\"#bib10\">Birkholz et al., 2015</a>). As discussed above, the molecular markers argue that lineage 18 is produced by NB2-4, and we conclude that NB3-4 gives rise to the newly described lineage 25."

Axon bundles of both lineages extend similarly and apparently terminate in neighboring compartments of the leg neuropil, NBs of both lineages express Msh, and neurons in both lineages express BarH (<a href=\"#bib82\">Truman et al, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lacin et al., 2014b</a>). Reporter immortalization of R19B05<sup>AD</sup>-R45D04<sup>DBD</sup> marks both of these lineages in the larval CNS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). In the embryonic nerve cord, this driver marks two neighboring NBs, presumably the progenitors of these two lineages (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013F</a>). Both NBs express Msh and <i>gsb</i>-lacZ, and neither of them expresses En (which marks row 6/7 NBs) or <i>unpg</i>-lacZ (which marks NB5-5) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C-D, E</a>; not shown). Previous studies identified only one NB, NB5-4, with such molecular expression (<a href=\"#bib9\">Birkholz et al., 2013</a>) and proposed that lineage 20 and lineage 22 both arise from NB5-4 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Birkholz et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, we identified one of these NBs as NB5-4 based on embryonic clones generated with the R19B05<sup>AD</sup>-R45D04<sup>DBD</sup> line. These clones contained a single NB and several motor neurons exiting the CNS via the SN as previously shown for the progeny of NB5-4 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6A\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schmidt et al., 1997</a>). However, clones from the other NB always appeared as a single large cell without any associated progeny. This pattern of one NB with progeny and the other without was evident in clones generated with R19B05<sup>AD</sup>-R45D04<sup>DBD</sup> and the GAL4 driver R17A10 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6B\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The lineage clones mentioned above tend to contain the entire progeny of the NB because we induced clone formation in gastrulating embryos. Thus, the isolated NB does not appear to make any embryonic progeny. Also, we never found the two NBs in the same clone, as would be expected if they came from the same precursor. Finally, we found the isolated NB only in the thoracic segments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). We believe this NB has not been previously described, so we named it NB5-7. The GAL4 line R24C02-GAL4 marks NB5-7 but not NB5-4 in the embryonic CNS, and its immortalization results in lineage 20 in the postembryonic CNS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>)."

In <i>antp</i> mutant embryos, NB2-3 and NB3-4 lineages formed normally, but their axons failed to exit the CNS, especially in the T2 and T3 segments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). In agreement with this phenotype, in wild-type animals, we detected significantly higher level of Antp protein in the T2-T3 segments compared to the T1 segment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

In the larva, these neurons arrest after extending their axons into the periphery towards the leg discs and wait until metamorphosis before invading the developing leg disc (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#bib82\">Truman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Baek and Mann, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Brierley et al., 2009</a> and <a href=\"#bib14\">2012</a>). Like their postembryonic counterparts, the embryonic progeny of NB2-3 are primarily arrested motor neurons that lack muscle targets at hatching. We identified two lines, R77B09<sup>AD</sup>-R28H10<sup>DBD</sup> and VT006878, which mark ventrally and dorsally located NB2-3 embryonic progeny, respectively (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). These arrested motor neurons are evident in these lines at hatching. By feeding larvae on food containing EDU from hatching and then examining the clusters just prior to metamorphosis (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,E</a>), we found that all of the arrested motor neurons lacked EDU incorporation, showing that these lines do not add any of the postembryonic members of this lineage. Their axons split into two bundles after exiting the larval CNS. One bundle extends across the body wall, and, in T1 only, includes one functional motor neuron that innervates a muscle field while the rest of the axons appear to stall in their peripheral nerve (not shown). The other bundle extends towards the leg disc but its axons also stall out on the nerve (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,F</a>). Except for the T1 motor neuron, these stalled neurons are also negative for vGLUT expression (a marker of mature motor neurons) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Thus, our results suggest that almost all of the embryonic progeny of NB2-3 are developmentally arrested and a subset are potentially leg motor neurons."

A similar pattern is also seen for one of the flight motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib22\">Consoulas et al., 2002</a>). The vast majority of embryonic interneurons, though, become functional neurons in the larva, but some of these neurons still share characteristics with their postembryonic-born siblings (e.g., <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). For example, axons of a subset of NB6-1 embryonic progeny bundle with the lineage 12A neurons (the postembryonic progeny of NB6-1), and both populations of neurons express Unc-4 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a> and not shown). Interestingly, in complex embryonic lineages with several different axonal projections, the postembryonic born neurons followed only one or two of these projections. For example, the embryonic progeny of NB4-1 are quite complex, with four main types of neurons: (i) efferent neurons, (ii) intersegmental interneurons, (iii) local interneurons that cross the midline via the posterior commissure, and (iv) local interneurons that cross the midline via the anterior commissure (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bossing et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Schmid et al., 1999</a>). The last class can be further subdivided based on whether they cross in dorsal or ventral neuropil (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). The postembryonic progeny of NB4-1 conform to the two subclasses of the type-iv interneurons: axons from the 14A hemilineage cross the midline via the ventral anterior commissure, whereas axons of the 14B hemilineage use the dorsal anterior commissure (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). We suspected that the postembryonic cells shared features with the last class of embryonic neurons to be born. To identify when these embryonic neurons are born, we roughly mapped their birth order of the NB4-1 progeny based on clone induction time and clone size. The smallest embryonic clones consistently contained only the two type-iv subtypes (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>), showing that they are the last type of neurons that are produced in the embryo. Cells with these two projection patterns then continue to be made through the entire postembryonic phase to generate the 14A and 14B hemilineages. Most of the 14B neurons, though, die soon after their birth (<a href=\"#bib81\">Truman et al., 2010</a>)."

We hypothesized that both embryonic and postembryonic Unc-4<sup>+</sup> interneurons are born in the Cas window and that these neurons would therefore not form in animals lacking <i>cas</i> function, since Cas is necessary for the formation of neurons born during the embryonic Cas window (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kambadur et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Isshiki et al., 2001</a>).

However, the larval-born Unc-4<sup>+</sup> interneurons in <i>cas</i>-null MARCM clones formed and extended their contralateral axon similar to those of wild type (not shown), indicating that larval born neurons do not require Cas function for their identity and that temporal identity in these two phases of neurogenesis may be regulated differently."

Moreover, the late-born embryonic neurons are the most similar to the postembryonic group. We examined whether this pattern of common transcription factor expression is universal, by assaying all lineages for the expression of transcription factors at both embryonic and postembryonic stages (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lacin et al., 2014b</a>, data in this study). We performed antibody staining against these transcription factors in embryos with FLP-out clones that marked specific embryonic lineages. As shown in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, we found that, in almost all lineages, transcription factors that mark a specific postembryonic lineage are also expressed in some of the embryonic progeny of the same lineage. Moreover, neurons expressing these transcription factors in the embryo tended to be located nearest to the NB, indicating they are born late in the embryonic lineage. For example, the first division of NB4-2 generates Eve<sup>+</sup> RP2 and Dbx<sup>+</sup> RP2-sib neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lacin et al., 2009</a>).

Individual NBs have been identified based on their large size and location in the array, by molecular marker expression including genetic handles such as lacZ and GAL4 lines, or by the morphology of their progeny. Only a few NBs have been studied comprehensively including all these features [e.g., NB5-6 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baumgardt et al., 2009</a>). Here, we have used a suite of molecular markers and a library of GAL4 lines, many of which are specific to individual NBs, to characterize the entire set of thoracic NBs, including their embryonic and postembryonic progeny."

We found that three of these NBs appear to be confined to the thorax, and two of them (NB2-3 and NB3-4) are dedicated to producing motor neurons for the leg. The third NB, NB5-7, had not been previously described and is unique in that it appears to have only a postembryonic neurogenic phase. Although the segmental NB array has been highly conserved through insect evolution (<a href=\"#bib79\">Thomas et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Truman and Bate, 1988</a>), we think that NB5-7 is a recent addition, likely by a duplication of NB5-4."

                                "text": "This two-phase pattern of neurogenesis evolved from a simpler scheme, such as seen in grasshoppers, in which all neurons were generated during an extended embryonic phase (Bate 1976; <a href=\"#bib73\">Shepherd and Bate, 1990</a>). The similarity of the neurons just before and after quiescence in flies suggests that the insect NBs dealt with metamorphosis by simply suspending their ongoing fate determination through the arrest period and then resuming from that point once neurogenesis was restarted. In other words, metamorphosis did not likely require the resetting of a fate determination clock on the development of a novel postembryonic system."

It links <i>Drosophila</i> embryonic neuroblasts (eNB; which have a long history of descriptive and mechanistic studies) with larval neuroblasts (lNB; that also have a long history of descriptive and mechanistic studies). In this paper Haluk Lacin and James Truman present a range of new reagents, primarily Gal4 and split-Gal4 expression lines, that have allowed them to address key questions of <i>Drosophila</i> nervous system development. The authors identify three new neuroblasts that were previously missed. The manuscript corrects several eNB \u2013 lNB assignments made last year by Birkholz et al. (which was also very nice work). It shows that the last born eNB progeny are molecularly and morphologically similar to the lNB progeny, and thus the period of quiescence does not dramatically 'reprogram' the progenitor lineage. It describes the role of Hox genes and apoptosis in shaping the segment-specific lNB array (not super novel, but nice data)."

Both the NB 5-4 and NB 5-7 postembryonic lineages (Lin22 and Lin20, respectively) are associated with leg motor control, suggesting this to be potentially a relatively late evolutionary modification of the groundplan of the neuroblast map."

Here, the evidence presented suggest that with metamorphosis a temporal break has been inserted into the cell division pattern: late embryonic neurons are often similar in marker gene expression pattern and neurite trajectory to the early postembryonic cells. This suggests that postembryonically lineages resume where they left off, as opposed to starting generally with a novel programme of differentiation."

While the authors give a clear account of why they think NB 2-3 as the correct assignment, it would help to also read as to why they think lineage 7 the postembryonic product of NB 3-2. In other words, it could be most helpful to the field if the authors could find a way of constructively reconciling discrepancies where possible, and to point to those where reasonable doubts remain. Before final acceptance it is essential that the authors discuss each of the 8 neuroblast lineage assignments, in which the authors differ from Birkholz et al., in detail.
