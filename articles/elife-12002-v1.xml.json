                    "text": "Activation of the mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase in models of acute and chronic pain is strongly implicated in mediating enhanced translation and hyperalgesia. However, the molecular mechanisms by which mTOR regulates nociception remain unclear. Here we show that deletion of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), a major mTOR downstream effector, which represses eIF4E activity and cap-dependent translation, leads to mechanical, but not thermal pain hypersensitivity. Mice lacking 4E-BP1 exhibit enhanced spinal cord expression of neuroligin 1, a cell-adhesion postsynaptic protein regulating excitatory synapse function, and show increased excitatory synaptic input into spinal neurons, and a lowered threshold for induction of synaptic potentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E or genetic reduction of neuroligin 1 levels normalizes the increased excitatory synaptic activity and reverses mechanical hypersensitivity. Thus, translational control by 4E-BP1 downstream of mTOR effects the expression of neuroligin 1 and excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord, and thereby contributes to enhanced mechanical nociception."

However, the molecular mechanisms by which mTOR regulates nociception remain unclear. Here we show that deletion of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), a major mTOR downstream effector, which represses eIF4E activity and cap-dependent translation, leads to mechanical, but not thermal pain hypersensitivity. Mice lacking 4E-BP1 exhibit enhanced spinal cord expression of neuroligin 1, a cell-adhesion postsynaptic protein regulating excitatory synapse function, and show increased excitatory synaptic input into spinal neurons, and a lowered threshold for induction of synaptic potentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E or genetic reduction of neuroligin 1 levels normalizes the increased excitatory synaptic activity and reverses mechanical hypersensitivity. Thus, translational control by 4E-BP1 downstream of mTOR effects the expression of neuroligin 1 and excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord, and thereby contributes to enhanced mechanical nociception."

Regulation of gene expression at the level of translation enables the cell to rapidly change its proteome by modulating the rate of mRNA translation without altering mRNA levels (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>). Upregulation of mRNA translation via activation of the mechanical/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by noxious stimuli has been proposed to sensitize primary nociceptors and spinal circuits (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bogen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ferrari et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jimenez-Diaz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Melemedjian et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Obara and Hunt, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Price and Geranton, 2009</a>). mTOR is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that controls cell homeostasis through key molecular processes including translation, lipid biogenesis, autophagy, and cytoskeleton organization (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shimobayashi and Hall, 2014</a>). mTOR is the catalytic subunit of two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lipton and Sahin, 2014</a>). mTORC1 is defined by the protein raptor and is sensitive to rapamycin, while mTORC2 is defined by the protein rictor and is rapamycin insensitive. mTORC1 is a key regulator of translation, whereas mTORC2 controls the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jacinto et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sarbassov et al., 2004</a>). The mTORC1 pathway is activated in primary nociceptors and superficial dorsal horn neurons in rodent models of inflammatory pain (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Liang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Norsted Gregory et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Xu et al., 2011</a>), bone cancer-induced pain (<a href=\"#bib39\">Shih et al., 2012</a>), neuropathic pain (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>), and in response to repeated morphine administration (<a href=\"#bib47\">Xu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Xu et al., 2014</a>). The functional role of mTORC1 activation has been studied using the mTORC1 specific inhibitor, rapamycin, and its derivatives (rapalogues). Systemic or intrathecal (i.t.) administration of rapalogues does not affect acute responses to mechanical and thermal stimuli (<a href=\"#bib15\">Geranton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Xu et al., 2014</a>), but it reduces nocifensive behaviors, and normalizes mechanical hypersensitivity in rodent models of inflammatory pain (<a href=\"#bib1\">Asante et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Price and Geranton, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Price et al., 2007</a>), bone cancer-induced pain (<a href=\"#bib39\">Shih et al., 2012</a>), and neuropathic pain (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asante et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cui et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). Taken together, these findings indicate that noxious stimuli-induced activation of mTORC1 plays an important role in the development of pain hypersensitivity. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the effect of mTORC1 on nociception are not known."

Recruitment of the ribosome to the mRNA is primarily regulated at the initiation step. A critical step of this process is the assembly of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, which consists of eIF4E, the cap binding protein subunit, eIF4G, a large scaffold protein, and eIF4A, an RNA helicase that unwinds the mRNA 5\u2019 UTR (untranslated region) secondary structure. Because eIF4E generally exhibits the lowest expression level of all eukaryotic initiation factors, the cap-recognition step is rate-limiting for translation and a major target for regulation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>). mTORC1 is a key regulator of translation initiation via phosphorylation of its downstream targets, eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) and p70S6 kinases (S6Ks). In their hypo-phosphorylated form, 4E-BPs compete with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E to repress eIF4F complex assembly, and thereby translation initiation. Following phosphorylation by mTORC1, 4E-BPs dissociate from eIF4E, allowing for eIF4F complex formation and activation of translation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gingras et al., 1996</a>). Three 4E-BP isoforms (1, 2, and 3) have similar functions, differing in their tissue distribution. 4E-BP3 expression is limited to few tissues, and is excluded from the nervous system. In the forebrain, 4E-BP2 is the major isoform, and 4E-BP2 knockout mice exhibit enhanced excitation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gkogkas et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ran et al., 2013</a>), alterations in synaptic plasticity, memory (<a href=\"#bib4\">Banko et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Banko et al., 2005</a>), and social behavior (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gkogkas et al., 2013</a>). In the suprachiasmatic nucleus, 4E-BP1 controls circadian clock functions via regulation of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (<i>Vip</i>) mRNA translation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>). In the pain pathway, 4E-BP1 is expressed in neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and in peripheral nerves (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jimenez-Diaz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Melemedjian et al., 2011</a>), whereas in the\u00a0dorsal root ganglion (DRG) it was detected only in satellite glial cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Xu et al., 2010</a>)."

Activation of ERK is caused by disinhibition of the S6K1/IRS-1/ERK negative feedback loop (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carracedo et al., 2008</a>). Here, we investigated the role of the other major mTORC1 downstream effectors, 4E-BPs, in nociception using <i>Eif4ebp1 and 2</i> knockout (<i>Eif4epb</i><sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Removal of 4E-BP1 and 2 relieves eIF4E suppression and provides an opportunity to study cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of mTORC1, via 4E-BPs, on nociception. Previous work showed that intraplantar administration of two well-known sensitizers of nociceptors, IL-6 and NGF, upregulates eIF4F complex formation and cap-dependent translation in primary afferent neurons (<a href=\"#bib26\">Melemedjian et al., 2010</a>). Peripheral inhibition of eIF4F with a specific inhibitor, 4EGI-1, completely blocked IL-6- and NGF-induced mechanical allodynia, supporting the idea that enhanced eIF4F complex formation and cap-dependent translation contribute to sensitization of primary afferents. However, the roles of eIF4F and 4E-BPs in\u00a0the regulation of spinal circuits are unknown. Here we show that <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup>, but not <i>Eif4ebp2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit mechanical (but not thermal) hypersensitivity, which can be rescued by intrathecal administration of 4EGI-1. Mechanical hypersensitivity is also elicited by downregulation of 4E-BP1 in the spinal cord dorsal horn. In <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, the excitatory synaptic input into spinal neurons is enhanced and the threshold for potentiation of electrically-evoked field post-synaptic potentials (fPSPs) in the superficial dorsal horn is lowered. The enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission is mediated via increased synthesis of neuroligin 1, which promotes the excitatory synapse function. Reduction of neuroligin 1 levels in <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice normalizes excitatory synaptic transmission, and partially reverses mechanical allodynia. Collectively, our data demonstrate that de-repression of eIF4E, via removal of 4E-BP1, contributes to mechanical allodynia through a\u00a0neuroligin 1-mediated increase in the excitatory synaptic drive to the spinal circuit, and provides a new paradigm to explain the mechanisms by which mTORC1 controls nociception."

In contrast, <i>Eif4ebp2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed no mechanical (von Frey and tail clip tests, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) or thermal pain phenotype (radiant heat paw-withdrawal and hot-plate tests, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and no alterations in formalin test behavior (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Mice lacking both 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (<i>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup>/2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) showed mechanical hypersensitivity and increased pain behavior in formalin test (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>), a phenotype identical to <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. We did not detect any reorganization of the dorsal horn of <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice as assessed by neuronal marker NeuN (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), projection of peptidergic (expressing substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>) or non-peptidergic (expressing isolectin B4 (IB4), <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>) C fibers, distribution of glial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>), and 5HT3A receptor (HTR3A, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>). To exclude the possibility that the phenotypes observed in <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> animals were the result of long-term developmental compensations and to test the role of 4E-BP1 selectively in the spinal cord, we knocked down <i>Eif4ebp1</i> in the dorsal horn of adult wild-type mice using an intraparenchymal injection of lentivirus expressing shRNA against <i>Eif4ebp1</i>. The virus-driven eGFP expression was restricted to the dorsal horn and showed mostly neuronal localization (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Seven days after injection of <i>Eif4ebp1</i> shRNA into the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord, mice showed reduced levels of 4E-BP1 protein in the lumbar spinal cord (53 \u00b1 9% reduction, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), but not in DRGs, and exhibited mechanical, but not thermal hypersensitivity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>). To study the distribution of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, we performed western blot analysis of proteins prepared from DRG and superficial spinal cord, which showed the presence of 4E-BP1, but much less of\u00a0the\u00a04E-BP2 isoform (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that 4E-BP1 is the predominant functional isoform in the pain pathway and its downregulation in the spinal cord elicits mechanical hypersensitivity."

The amplitude and frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSC) were increased in <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In the spinal cord, fast inhibitory synaptic transmission is mediated via GABA and glycine receptors. Interestingly, while glycinergic mIPSC amplitude and frequency were enhanced, no alterations were measured in GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The increase in the mEPSC amplitude in lamina II spinal neurons of <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> was reversed by i.t. administration of 4EGI-1 (10 \u03bcg, daily for 3 days, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), however, 4EGI-1 had no effect on the increased amplitude and frequency of mIPSC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The reasons for these differences will be addressed in the Discussion."

Consistent with previous reports, e.g. <a href=\"#bib42\">Tahmasebi et al., 2014</a>, we found no differences in rates of general translation between wild-type and <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, using the puromycin incorporation assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), supporting the idea that alterations in translation of a small subset of mRNAs engender nociceptive phenotypes in <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. We previsouly\u00a0investigated the mechanisms underlying the enhanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons of <i>Eif4ebp2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gkogkas et al., 2013</a>). 4E-BP2 is the major 4E-BP isoform in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib3\">Banko et al., 2005</a>). Members of the family of post-synaptic adhesion proteins, neuroligins, were upregulated in the hippocampus of 4E-BP2 depleted mice, leading to changes in synaptic transmission. Specifically, translation of neuroligin (<i>Nlgn</i>) 1, 2 and 3 mRNAs was increased in the brain of <i>Eif4ebp2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Neuroligin 1 controls excitatory synapse formation, maturation, and function, whereas neuroligin 2 regulates inhibitory synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib22\">Krueger et al., 2012</a>). Neuroligin 3 controls both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. An additional study has revealed a translational upregulation of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPA) receptor subunits, Glua1 and Glua2 in response to 4E-BP2 ablation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ran et al., 2013</a>).

IL-6 and NGF-mediated enhancement of eIF4F complex formation play an important role in mediating mechanical nociceptive plasticity in primary afferent neurons (<a href=\"#bib26\">Melemedjian et al., 2010</a>). However, the roles of eIF4F and 4E-BPs in regulation of spinal circuits remain unknown. Here, we show that de-repression of translation by removal of 4E-BP1 leads to enhanced eIF4F complex formation in the spinal cord, and to mechanical hypersensitivity and increased response to noxious chemical/inflammatory stimuli. This effect was observed in both <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice and in mice with selective downregulation of 4E-BP1 in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Normalization of eIF4F complex levels in <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice by intrathecal administration of 4EGI-1 reversed the exaggerated mechanical sensation, thus demonstrating that the enhanced eIF4F complex is the underlying cause for mechanical hypersensitivity in <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice."

Consistent with this and with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gkogkas et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tahmasebi et al., 2014</a>), we found that general translation is not altered in <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), indicating that upregulated translation of certain mRNAs contributes to the nociceptive phenotypes of these mice. Previous studies have documented that\u00a0mRNAs in the family of neuroligin proteins are being translationally activated by eIF4F in the nervous system, such as in mice overexpressing eIF4E or lacking 4E-BP2 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gkogkas et al., 2013</a>). We therefore reasoned that the enhanced mechanical nociception in <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice could be mediated via enhanced translation of <i>Nlgn</i> mRNAs. Indeed, we found that the expression of neuroligins was increased in the spinal cord of <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice without concomitant changes in mRNA levels, indicating enhanced translation. The role of neuroligins in the spinal cord is not well studied. A recent study showed that knock-down of neuroligin 2, which promotes inhibitory synaptic transmission, in the spinal cord of na\u00efve rats increases mechanical sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dolique et al., 2013</a>). The role of neuroligin 1, which promotes excitatory synaptic transmission, in pain processing has not been investigated. Consistent with the higher levels of neuroligin 1, 2 and 3 in mice lacking 4E-BP1, we found that excitatory and inhibitory spinal synaptic transmission are increased in these animals. Chronic pain is associated with an increase in the excitatory synaptic drive to dorsal horn neurons (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sandkuhler, 2009</a>). Therefore, in the current study we focused on neuroligin 1 and its role in promoting excitatory synaptic transmission in <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice."

Similarly to GABA<sub>A</sub>, glycine receptors mediate fast synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord, where they regulate nociceptive and tactile sensory processing. Little is known about how synaptic strength of glycinergic synapses is regulated in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that the inhibitory synaptic transmission was not affected by intrathecal administration of 4EGI-1, possibly because of reduced sensitivity to 4EGI-1 or because inhibitory synaptic transmission is regulated by 4EGI-1 insensitive processes downstream of 4E-BP1. The differential regulation of glycinergic synaptic transmission by mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway in the spinal cord is intriguing, and further studies will be necessary to better understand the precise molecular mechanism of this regulation. However, the increased inhibition in <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice was not reversed by normalization of neuroligin 1 expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), and is thus unlikely to play major role in the reduced nociceptive thresholds of <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, which were reversed by normalization of neuroligin 1 expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,G</a>)."

An mTORC1-mediated increase in eIF4F complex formation, which leads to the enhancement of synaptic transmission and lowering of the threshold for the induction of synaptic potentiation, is likely to contribute to abnormal pain processing in models of chronic pain. Though our study demonstrates an important role of enhanced expression of neuroligin 1 in the nociceptive phenotype of <i>Eif4ebp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, it is conceivable that translational upregulation of other mRNAs contributes to the regulation of nociception downstream of mTORC1 and ribosome-profiling studies are required to identify these transcripts."

Spinal cords were extracted trough laminectomy and post-fixed for 2\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. Lumbar levels (L3-L5) of spinal cords were sectioned using a vibratome and collected in PB saline (PBS) (50-\u00b5m thick free floating transverse sections). Sections were washed in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS-T; Sigma Aldrich) for 30\u2009min at RT. To block unspecific staining, sections were treated with PBS-T containing 10% normal goat serum (NGS) for 1\u2009hr at RT. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS-T containing 5% NGS, overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections were washed in PBS-T for 30\u2009min and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted 1:800 in PBS-T, at RT for 2\u2009hr, protected from light. For isolectin B4 (IB4) staining, sections were incubated with IB4 conjugated to AlexaFluor 546, 1:200 (Molecular Probes) for 1\u2009hr at RT. All steps were carried out under constant shaking. After 30\u2009min of final washes in PBS-T and 10\u2009min in PBS, sections were mounted with SlowFade Gold (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada). The slides were stored protected from light at 4\u00b0C until examined by use of the Olympus confocal microscope using a 20x oil-immersion objective. Antibodies used for immunohistochemistry were: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:2000, GFAP Mouse mAb, Cell Signalling, <b>#</b>3670), NEUronal Nuclei (NeuN, 1:5000, Mouse Anti-NeuN Antibody, clone A60, MAB377), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP, 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, C8198), substance P (1:400, Neuromics, MO15094), HTR3A (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich, AV13046), and c-Fos (1:10000, Calbiochem, PC38). For detection, species-specific secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor 488 (1:800, Invitrogen Molecular probes) and goat anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 546 (1:800, Invitrogen Molecular Probes)."

To improve the efficiency of 4E-BP1 knockdown the injections were performed at six locations along the lumbar segment of the spinal cord (see experimental procedures).

These translation independent functions of mTORC1 have been recently implicated in many physiological and pathological processes in neurons (Malik et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2014). Because rapamycin affects both mRNA translation and other processes downstream of mTORC1, it is difficult to conclude whether the effects of rapamycin on nociception are mediated via mRNA translation or other mechanisms. Thus, it is imperative to investigate specific roles of 4E-BPs and eIF4F complex in modulation of mechanical hypersensitivity. A previous study showed that intraplantar injection of IL-6 and NGF upregulates eIF4F complex formation and cap-dependent translation in primary afferent neurons, and induces mechanical allodynia, which is completely blocked by co-injection of 4EGI-1 (Melemedjian et al., 2010).

In our work we selectively downregulate 4E-BP1 in the spinal cord dorsal horn and manipulate the expression level of neuroligin 1, which controls synaptic transmission. To assess synaptic functions we measure mEPSC/mIPSC amplitude and frequency, and activity-dependent synaptic potentiation. We find that while normalization of neuroligin 1 levels in <i>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice corrects increased excitatory synaptic inputs to spinal neurons, it only partially reverses the enhanced mechanical sensation. These results are consistent with the existence of other 4E-BP1-dependent mechanisms. In the revised version we explain better that the current study characterizes the mechanisms by which 4E-BP1 regulates nociception in the spinal cord (paragraph three, subsection \u201c4E-BP1 ablation induces mechanical hypersensitivity\u201d and Discussion). Additionally, we extend the description of the literature on the role of mTOR and eIF4E in sensitization of primary sensory neurons (paragraph three, Introduction and Discussion). <i>2) The mouse is a global knockout and it is therefore desirable to know whether there is any reorganization within the dorsal horn.</i>"

This is supported by the fact that spontaneous synaptic transmission, which is independent of presynaptic neuron evoked activity, is enhanced in <i>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice and can be rescued by neuroligin 1 downregulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Moreover, the enhanced inhibition must necessarily also arise from intraspinal circuits since sensory afferents are not inhibitory. While we feel that investigating whether the mechanical sensitivity of <i>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice is driven by C and/ or A\u03b4 fibers should be addressed in future studies, we made significant efforts to measure the contribution of C and A fibers, as suggested by the reviewer. It is noteworthy that the Torsney and MacDermott paper, which the reviewer refers to, uses different approaches than used here. They used a rat preparation, which allows for the preservation of much longer sensory afferents for enhanced temporal separation between A- and C-fiber input than is generally possible with mice, resulting in reduced response noise. The Torsney and MacDermott study is also restricted to NK1+ neurons, which is a much more homogeneous neuron population than that studied here, and which is largely absent from lamina II, where we focused our efforts. A detailed study of all defined cell populations in the dorsal horn is a long term commitment. We performed a lengthy investigation of afferent-evoked responses in lamina II neurons to permit extrapolation from our reported electrophysiological results. We consistently observed an overly large degree of variability in these data that did not permit conclusive interpretation. Although this is not entirely unexpected given the heterogeneity between lamina II neurons and their likely synaptic input, we feel that the inherent difficulties of this approach further support our focus on spinal mechanisms of 4E-BP1 inhibition: the contrast of the heterogeneity of evoked responses in lamina II neurons with the consistent effect of 4E-BP1 modulation on miniature synaptic activity in lamina II neurons reinforces our position (which is supported by numerous, consistent lines of evidence in this manuscript) that changes in pain behaviour produced by 4E-BP1 inhibition are likely related to an increase in excitability of spinal cord sensory processing pathways.<i>4) The authors should determine whether 4EGI-1 normalizes the increase in mIPSC amplitude and frequency in the 4E-BP1 knockout mice.</i>"
