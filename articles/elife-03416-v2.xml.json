Using CD4<sup>+</sup> autoimmune Teff cells, we demonstrate that peptide immunotherapy (PIT) is strictly dependent upon sustained T cell expression of the co-inhibitory molecule PD-1. We found high levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at the PD-1 (<i>Pdcd1</i>) promoter of non-tolerant T cells. 5hmC was lost in response to PIT, with DNA hypomethylation of the promoter. We identified dynamic changes in expression of the genes encoding the Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) proteins that are associated with the oxidative conversion 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC, during cytosine demethylation. We describe a model whereby promoter demethylation requires the co-incident expression of permissive histone modifications at the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoter together with TET availability. This combination was only seen in tolerant Teff cells following PIT, but not in Teff that transiently express PD-1. Epigenetic changes at the <i>Pdcd1</i> locus therefore determine the tolerizing potential of TCR-ligation."

Using CD4<sup>+</sup> autoimmune Teff cells, we demonstrate that peptide immunotherapy (PIT) is strictly dependent upon sustained T cell expression of the co-inhibitory molecule PD-1. We found high levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at the PD-1 (<i>Pdcd1</i>) promoter of non-tolerant T cells. 5hmC was lost in response to PIT, with DNA hypomethylation of the promoter. We identified dynamic changes in expression of the genes encoding the Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) proteins that are associated with the oxidative conversion 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC, during cytosine demethylation. We describe a model whereby promoter demethylation requires the co-incident expression of permissive histone modifications at the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoter together with TET availability. This combination was only seen in tolerant Teff cells following PIT, but not in Teff that transiently express PD-1. Epigenetic changes at the <i>Pdcd1</i> locus therefore determine the tolerizing potential of TCR-ligation."

The success of the peptide therapy depended on the T cells producing large amounts of a protein called PD-1.

Its role in maintaining peripheral tolerance under steady state conditions is illustrated by the spontaneous development of autoimmune pathology in mice that lack PD-1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nishimura et al., 1999</a>). PD-1 is also highly-expressed on exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barber et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Youngblood et al., 2013</a>). PD-1 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-switch motif (ITSM) that is thought to recruit SHP-2, a phosphatase that can inhibit the PI3K pathway (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chemnitz et al., 2004</a>). Signalling through PD-1 upon TCR stimulation has been shown to inhibit proliferation and the production of IL-2 and effector cytokines by T cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Freeman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sandner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Keir et al., 2006</a>).

Although PIT has been reported to reverse clinical signs of disease (<a href=\"#bib29\">Leech et al., 2007</a>), this scenario has been seldom explored mechanistically. An understanding of this is clearly of major importance to successful clinical translation. Here we used a peptide of myelin basic protein (MBP) and MBP-responsive TCR transgenic cells to show that PIT was capable of silencing Teff cells, thereby preventing murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). PD-L1<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DC) were uniquely capable of providing sustained presentation of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes following PIT. PD-1-deficient T cells were resistant to PIT. In PD-1-sufficient Teff, PIT drove demethylation of the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoter, correlating with loss of 5-hydroxymethylation (a potential DNA demethylation intermediate) and lasting PD-1 expression. These data help define an epigenetic signature of T cell tolerance following PIT and therefore have implications for the development of protein biomarkers for clinical efficacy in current and anticipated tolerogenic modalities."

To trace a defined antigen-responsive cohort of T cells we adapted these protocols by prior transfer of na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> Tg4.CD45.1 T cells into B10.PL (H-2<sup>u</sup>), or B10.PLxC57BL/6 (H-2<sup>u,b</sup>) mice. These F<sub>1</sub> mice are resistant to EAE induced with the MBP peptide, unless first seeded with a cohort of Tg4 T cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ryan et al., 2005</a>). Tracing the presence and function of the transferred Tg4 cells is therefore of direct relevance as they are the pathogenic T cell population in these experiments. A single i.v. injection of the MBP peptide protected against subsequent efforts to induce EAE by immunization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Donor T cells persisted in the spleen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), but there was reduced production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17, in splenic recall assays amongst PIT-treated mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Of note, we found no evidence for an elevation in the frequency of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> donor Tg4 cells, nor in IL-10 production in response to PIT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We concluded from these initial studies that a single exposure to the MBP peptide was sufficient for successful PIT, without enhanced induction of cell death, or establishment of Treg-mediated suppression, but rather an intrinsic unresponsiveness in the persisting Tg4 cells."

This, coupled with pMHC presentation specifically by PD-L1<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> DC renders the T cells unable to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. To determine the functional importance of PD-1 in this tolerogenic process, we generated Tg4.PD-1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice. Transferred na\u00efve Tg4 cells from these mice were insensitive to PIT, going on to cause a typical course of EAE upon subsequent immunization that was indistinguishable from that induced with Tg4.PD-1<sup>+/+</sup> cells that had not been subjected to PIT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We therefore conclude that PD-1 plays a non-redundant role in this model of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell tolerance."

We therefore determined the effects of PIT using a previously established passive EAE model in which Teff cells are generated from na\u00efve Tg4 T cells prior to transfer into WT hosts (<a href=\"#bib36\">O'Connor et al., 2010</a>). PIT rendered the host mice profoundly resistant to disease (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). As with na\u00efve T cells shown above, the Teff cells persisted after PIT-treatment, but importantly these cells failed to populate the CNS efficiently (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Instead, they were present in the spleen in sufficient numbers to allow detailed analysis following retrieval by FACS-sorting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). PIT did not drive Foxp3-expression in Tg4 Teff cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), nor was IL-10 production evident (not shown). Rather, within 4 days of PIT, proinflammatory cytokine production by the transferred Teff cells was profoundly diminished (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). The loss of IFN-\u03b3 producing capacity in PIT-exposed Teff was not reflected in any loss in T-bet expression (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Although the molecular requirements for T cell entry into the CNS during EAE are complex and controversial (<a href=\"#bib40\">Prendergast and Anderton, 2009</a>), others have described a requirement for P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in the pathogenic process (<a href=\"#bib11\">Deshpande et al., 2006</a>). We have also found that encephalitogenic function of Tg4 Teff populations correlates with their elevated expression of PSGL-1 and that an antibody to PSGL-1 can inhibit Tg4 Teff-driven EAE (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), presumably by interfering with the interaction of PSGL-1 on the Teff cells with P-selectin and/or E-selectin on the CNS endothelium. Whilst transferred Tg4 Teff cells exposed to PBS showed elevated PSGL-1 expression, their counterparts that had been exposed to PIT showed PSGL-1 expression more comparable with that seen on the EAE-irrelevant CD4<sup>+</sup> cells of the host mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>), PSGL-1 glycosylation mediated by 2 \u03b2-1,6-N-acetyl glucosaminyltransferase and \u03b1(1,3)-fucosyltransferase-VII) is required for functionality (binding to selectins) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Smithson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sperandio et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Deshpande et al., 2006</a>).

However, the PIT-driven elevation in donor cell numbers seen with Tg4.PD-1<sup>+/+</sup> Teff cells was accentuated in Tg4.PD-1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Teff cells and a high frequency of these cells showed expression of the cell cycle marker Ki-67 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A consequence of this overall increase in the number of Tg4.PD-1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Teff cells was increased numbers of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells as well as cytokine<sup>+</sup> cells in this group. However, as seen with Tg4.PD-1<sup>+/+</sup> Teff cells, the frequencies of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> or cytokine<sup>+</sup> Tg4.PD-1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Teff cells were reduced following PIT (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 2,3</a>). In contrast to their reduced effector cytokine production, PIT did not block the ability of Tg4.PD-1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Teff cells to produce IL-2 upon ex vivo re-challenge (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Tg4 Teff cells retrieved from PBS-treated mice had low expression of CD25 and this was absent in their PIT-treated counterparts (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). After 12 hr culture with MBP peptide, CD25 expression was increased in PBS-exposed Teff cells, irrespective of their PD-1-status, but there was a notable impairment in this upregulation of CD25 in PIT-treated Tg4.PD-1<sup>+/+</sup> Teff cells. This impairment was not evident in PIT-exposed Tg4.PD-1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Teff cells (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>). The deficit in CD25-upregulation seen in PIT-treated Tg4.PD-1<sup>+/+</sup> Teff cells was reflected by a low frequency of cells with phosphorylated STAT5 in response to IL-2. Notably however, PIT-treated Tg4.PD-1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Teff cells did not show such abrogated STAT5 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5s6\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). We conclude that the ability of PD-1-deficient Teff cells to drive EAE despite administration of PIT is associated with their heightened capacity for clonal expansion."

We retrieved Tg4 cells at various stages of the Teff PIT model for DNA methylation analysis. DNA modification was quantified, after bisulfite conversion, using pyrosequencing to assess individual CpG sites within the whole cell population. Cloning and sequencing after bisulfite conversion provided complementary information on the pattern of DNA methylation at CpG sites across individual cloned alleles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Consistent with previous analyses of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Youngblood et al., 2011</a>), CpGs within the CR-B region were largely modified (\u223c80% methylation across most CpG sites) in na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> Tg4 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D</a>), whereas DNA methylation levels were considerably lower across the CR-C region.

As would be expected based on this result, DNA methylation was maintained at CR-B and CR-C in the Teff cells retrieved from PBS-treated hosts, where PD-1 expression had returned to levels observed in na\u00efve T cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In marked contrast, PIT-exposed Teff, which had prolonged PD-1 expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013F</a>), showed complete demethylation at CR-C and significantly reduced DNA methylation at the CR-B region in the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>).

A role for PD-1 in the establishment, or maintenance, of T cell unresponsiveness has been reported in various experimental models of autoimmune and allergic inflammation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Probst et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cheng et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Francisco et al., 2010</a>). Our previous work had excluded such a role for PD-1 in PIT-driven tolerance for naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, because PIT remained effective irrespective of antibody blockade or genetic deletion of PD-1 in the peptide-responsive T cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Konkel et al., 2010</a>). In the two experimental models used in that study, PIT appeared to drive the abortive activation and apoptosis of peptide-responsive na\u00efve T cells within 4 days, which would override any potential for PD-1-mediated long-term unresponsiveness. In contrast to those previous studies using na\u00efve T cells, we found here that Teff persisted following therapeutic application of PIT. In a recent study using PIT to silence allergic airways inflammation, we found an analogous accumulation of allergic Teff cells, indicating that persistence following PIT is common to Teff with different inflammatory functions (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mackenzie et al., 2014</a>)."

CD4<sup>+</sup> DC do not have that capacity, accounting for the absence of increased Foxp3-expression here, in Tg4 cells exposed to PIT.

Use of Tg4.PD-1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Teff cells indicated a key role for PD-1 in limiting clonal expansion following PIT. There are several ways in which this inhibition could be achieved. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways can lower cell proliferation by reducing transcription of SKP2. This gene encodes a crucial component of the ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>Skp2</sup>, which is required for cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activation and cell cycle progression from G1 into S phase (<a href=\"#bib37\">Parry et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Appleman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Patsoukis et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pauken et al., 2013</a>). Exogenous IL-2 only partially restores cell proliferation by activating the MEK/ERK pathway but not the PI3K/Akt pathway (<a href=\"#bib38\">Patsoukis et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that IL-2 cannot reverse PD-1-dependent unresponsiveness. Recruitment SHP-2 to the cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 is thought to function primarily by inhibiting the PI3K pathway (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chemnitz et al., 2004</a>). However, SHP-2 has also been implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of pSTAT5 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2003</a>) and PD-1 signalling has been associated with a decrease in both the expression and phosphorylation of STAT5 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Iliopoulos et al., 2011</a>). These observations correlate with the decreased levels of pSTAT5 we see in Tg4 Teff cells (with intact PD-1 signalling) following PIT. Furthermore, inactivation of STAT5 can lead to a reduction in cell-surface CD25 expression (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kim et al., 2001</a>). This, coupled with the inhibition of TCR signalling pathways by PD-1, would likely account for the impaired CD25 expression that we saw in PIT-exposed Tg4 Teff cells. An impaired ability to upregulate CD25, and therefore to respond to IL-2, is distinct from the classical profile for clonal anergy, in which unresponsive T cells can upregulate CD25 but cannot produce their own IL-2 (anergy is broken by addition of exogenous IL-2) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schwartz, 2003</a>). An unresponsive state that blocks CD25 upregulation can be viewed as more secure, since it removes the risk of IL-2 from a bystander source overcoming that unresponsiveness."

This might reflect their impaired ability to undergo clonal expansion upon subsequent exposure to MBP in the CNS, as discussed above. A recent report has indicated an additional role for PD-1 in inhibiting autoimmune T cell infiltration into the pancreas in diabetes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pauken et al., 2013</a>). Here we observed that tolerized Teff had lower levels of active PSGL-1 relative to pathogenic T cells (PBS group), which is an important component of pathogenic T cell entry into the CNS in this model. To our knowledge, no direct causal relationship between PD-1 and PSGL-1 has been established. T follicular helper (TFH) cells are PD-1<sup>hi</sup> and PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> , but we do not believe that PIT drives Teff towards a TFH fate, since we did not observe any production of the TFH-associated cytokine IL-21, nor did we find evidence for any gain of the TFH-associated transcription factor BCL-6 following PIT (data not shown). The transcription factor T-bet can inhibit PD-1 expression in CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kao et al., 2011</a>), but here we found that this was not the case for CD4<sup>+</sup> Teff cells, which were T-bet<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>hi</sup> following PIT, indicating that T-bet and PD-1 are not necessarily mutually antagonistic."

The <i>Pdcd1</i> promoter of Tg4 cells in their na\u00efve state appears to be fully methylated, although this includes a significant level of 5-hydroxymethylation. This, together with the availability of TETs 1\u20133 and the absence of the repressive H3K27me3 histone mark, suggests that the gene is poised for transcriptional activation and PD-1 expression. This would fit with the known early expression of PD-1 following initial TCR ligation (as seen here in Teff on the day of transfer). This PD-1 expression during Teff generation was mirrored by chromatin changes associated with gene transcription (H3K4me3 enrichment), but without a contemporaneous demethylation of the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoter. The considerable reduction in TET expression observed at the Teff stage should impede any active demethylation through the oxidation of either 5mC or 5hmC (a process that involves TET activity), thereby averting long-term PD-1 expression that would affect Teff function. As these cells transition to a PD-1-negative Teff state (pathogenic Tg4 cells retrieved from PBS-treated hosts), histone modifications associated with active transcription are no longer evident and, although TET expression has been restored, this repressive chromatin state prevents the TET (and other) proteins from accessing the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoter to allow demethylation. However, a key feature of the tolerogenic properties of PIT is to provide long-term PD-1 expression by tolerant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which is associated with the presence of stable histone modifications characteristic of active transcription (thus enabling access of the TET proteins, amongst others), and therefore loss of both 5mC and 5hmC at the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoter. These data indicate that analysis of the methylation/hydroxymethylation status of the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoters may facilitate the discrimination of tolerant versus recently activated PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells."

However, that work was based on assessment of the patients before undergoing PIT, rather than following PIT. It would therefore be important to understand the relative expression of PD-1 before and after treatment in individual patients in future studies. A limitation is the need to identify T cells that are relevant to the peptide(s) used for PIT. As the range of pMHC tetramers available expands, this should become more feasible. Furthermore, our study highlights the need for analysis of the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoter to discriminate PD-1<sup>hi</sup> pathogenic Teff from the PD-1<sup>hi</sup> Teff rendered tolerant by PIT. This would be challenging to combine with tetramer-based isolation of relatively small T cell populations, although perhaps not impossible. Therefore, whilst locus-specific DNA methylation-status would not prove a viable biomarker in itself, it might aid the identification of a surrogate phenotypic profile amenable to flow cytometric analysis."

So, do these two situations of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell tolerance and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion have the same underlying mechanism(s)? In some ways yes, but there are some pronounced differences. In both scenarios Teff cells express PD-1 but this is lost, either as they transition to memory cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Youngblood et al., 2011</a>), or here within 2 days of transfer in the absence of PIT. Conversely, exhausted or peptide-tolerized Teff cells maintain PD-1 expression. Youngblood et al reported that CD8<sup>+</sup> Teff cells that transiently expressed PD-1 already have demethylated <i>Pdcd1</i> promoters and their transition towards PD-1-negative memory cells is driven by the specific remethylation of their <i>Pdcd1</i> promoters (<a href=\"#bib59\">Youngblood et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, the methylation status of the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoters within our CD4<sup>+</sup> Teff cells that transiently expressed PD-1 appeared unaltered from that of na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. It was only in the PIT-treated Teff that we saw significant demethylation of the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoter, consistent with their sustained PD-1 expression. It will be important to determine whether these differences reflect intrinsic differences in how PD-1 expression is controlled in CD4<sup>+</sup> versus CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In addition, we are not aware of any information on 5hmC status of the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoter in CD8<sup>+</sup> cells."

In further studies they show that PIT sustains PD-1 expression in na\u00efve or effector T cells. Epigenetic studies reveal that PIT leads to demethylation of the <i>Pdcd1</i> promoter in tolerized T cells. These findings are of fundamental and translational importance.

As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>, all DC populations (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sub>-</sub>, CD8<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>-</sup> and pDC) as well as macrophages were equally capable of activation Tg4 Teff as assessed by CD44 upregulation. All APC populations also led to strongly increased PD-1 expression. Most tellingly, CD4<sup>+</sup> DC did not drive a loss in the ability of Tg4 Teff to produce proinflammatiory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and GM-SCF). Therefore these in vitro experiments using isolated DC were unable to recapitulate the tolerant nature of Tg4 Teff exposed to PIT in vivo. We conclude that, as we anticipated in our previous letter, activation of DC during their ex vivo isolation precludes any meaningful development of an in vitro model to determine/mimic their in vivo tolerogenic function. Based on this, and the comparatively rare nature of the CD4<sup>+</sup> DC population, any follow-on attempts at using these cells in transfer models seem impractical.

In particular, Teff appear capable of survival/expansion, rather than undergoing apoptosis (David et al., 2014; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mackenzie et al., 2014</a>).

Therefore, despite upregulation of PD-1 by PIT exposed T cells, there was no opportunity for this to mediate tolerance, as the cells died. This explains why PD-1 was not required in that model for the maintenance of tolerance (the cells had been deleted)."

We have performed additional experiments comparing the response profiles of Tg4.PD<sup>\u22121+/+</sup> versus Tg4.PD-1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Teff to PIT. As can be seen in the new <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, there is a marked expansion in the numbers of Tg4.PD-1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Teff cells in response to PIT. This is indicative of unrestrained clonal expansion in the absence of PD-1 signalling. To explore this further, we have assessed the ability of the Tg4 Teff to express CD25, and to produce and respond to IL-2. Upon ex vivo retrieval (4 days after PIT or PBS) levels of CD25 expression were low, irrespective of treatment group. CD25 expression was upregulated by in vitro stimulation with MBP peptide. Notably, this CD25 upregulation was impaired in the PIT-treated Tg4.PD<sup>\u22121+/+</sup> Teff cells, but was intact in PIT-treated Tg4.PD-1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Teff cells. As a consequence phosphorylation of STAT5 upon exposure to IL-2 in PIT-treated Tg4.PD-1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Teff cells was strong (at least equivalent to PBS-treated Teff cells), but was impaired in PIT-treated Tg4.PD<sup>\u22121+/+</sup> Teff cells. These data suggest that a key function of PD-1 during PIT is to restrict the capacity of Teff to proliferate through, impaired CD25 upregulation and STAT5 signaling."
