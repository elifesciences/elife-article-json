The neural mechanism used to recognize objects as prey remains largely unknown. We devised a machine learning behavior classification system to quantify hunting kinematics in semi-restrained animals exposed to a range of virtual stimuli. Two-photon calcium imaging revealed a small visual area, AF7, that was activated specifically by the optimal prey stimulus. This pretectal region is innervated by two types of retinal ganglion cells, which also send collaterals to the optic tectum. Laser ablation of AF7 markedly reduced prey capture behavior. We identified neurons with arbors in AF7 and found that they projected to multiple sensory and premotor areas: the optic tectum, the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (nMLF) and the hindbrain. These findings indicate that computations in the retina give rise to a visual stream which transforms sensory information into a directed prey capture response."

The neural mechanism used to recognize objects as prey remains largely unknown. We devised a machine learning behavior classification system to quantify hunting kinematics in semi-restrained animals exposed to a range of virtual stimuli. Two-photon calcium imaging revealed a small visual area, AF7, that was activated specifically by the optimal prey stimulus. This pretectal region is innervated by two types of retinal ganglion cells, which also send collaterals to the optic tectum. Laser ablation of AF7 markedly reduced prey capture behavior. We identified neurons with arbors in AF7 and found that they projected to multiple sensory and premotor areas: the optic tectum, the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (nMLF) and the hindbrain. These findings indicate that computations in the retina give rise to a visual stream which transforms sensory information into a directed prey capture response."

However, the circuits underlying these responses are mostly unknown. Zebrafish larvae have an instinctive ability to hunt small moving prey objects, such as paramecia, as soon as they start to swim at five days post fertilization (5 dpf). Before initiating a prey capture swim, a larva must select the target from its surroundings, calculate its location, and make a decision as to whether the target is worth pursuing. It then initiates a multi-step motor routine involving bouts of turning and swimming toward the prey, culminating in a consummatory strike (<a href=\"#bib6\">Budick and O'Malley, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Borla et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gahtan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">McElligott and O'Malley, 2005</a>). Precise maneuvers are required, and so prey capture tail movements are quite different from those observed during routine swims or escapes. To orient towards a paramecium on the left or right, larvae perform j-turns\u2014unilateral bends where the tail is held in a J shape. If the prey is directly ahead, they slowly swim toward it, with back and forth undulations of the tail (<a href=\"#bib28\">Patterson et al., 2013</a>). These movements appear to be triggered by small moving objects, but it is unclear how or where in the brain these objects are identified as prey."

However, these studies did not investigate the specific tail kinematics evoked by prey stimuli, or seek to categorize the tail movements as distinct from other types of swims. Here, we identified the distinctive features of prey capture swims in head fixed larvae, and developed a machine learning algorithm to quantify and distinguish these swims from other types of behavior. This allowed us to quantify the tail movements produced in response to a range of artificial prey stimuli, and determine the ideal stimulus to evoke the prey capture response."

In the mammalian visual system, certain RGC types act as feature detectors for one aspect of the visual scene, and the axons of these RGCs project to visual nuclei that mediate the response to that feature. For example, intrinsically photosensitive RGCs project to nuclei that control circadian rhythms and the pupillary light reflex (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2011</a>), and RGCs that respond to whole field motion innervate nuclei that drive compensatory eye movements (<a href=\"#bib40\">Simpson, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dhande et al., 2013</a>). In zebrafish, RGC axons terminate in ten retinorecipient areas called arborization fields (AFs) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burrill and Easter, 1994</a>), most of which have not been functionally characterized. We hypothesized that there could be a class of RGCs that respond specifically to prey-like visual stimuli and project to one or more of these AFs."

These results identify AF7 as vital part of the prey capture pathway, and link a dedicated retinal output to an ecologically relevant behavior."

Larvae were embedded in agarose at 6 dpf, and their tails were freed so that swimming movements could be recorded with a high-speed camera. Visual stimulation was provided by a small OLED screen in front of the larva. In preliminary experiments, we found that a small (\u223c3\u00b0 of the visual field) white dot moving horizontally across a black screen was effective in evoking behavior. Larvae performed two types of behavior in response to this virtual prey: forward swims, which consisted of low amplitude oscillations of the tail, and j-turns (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">McElligott and O'Malley, 2005</a>). These swims were accompanied by eye convergence, which is another kinematic feature of prey capture (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bianco et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Patterson et al., 2013</a>). Larvae also performed spontaneous swims in the absence of visual stimuli. To analyze tail movements, we digitized the tail, using a custom algorithm to assign \u223c40 points along its length in each frame (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Plotting the position of the tip of the tail during prey capture and spontaneous swims over time revealed several kinematic differences between the behaviors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Prey capture forward swims and spontaneous swims both consist of back and forth movements of the tail, but the amplitude of the prey capture swim is much lower. In contrast, during a j-turn the tail is deflected to one side, often for hundreds of milliseconds."

                                "text": "Given the highly selective nature of this innate behavioral response, we hypothesized that the preference for prey stimuli of a certain size and speed might arise in the retina. In that case, there should be a population of RGCs that responds specifically to prey. A recent functional imaging study reported responses to prey in the largest AF, the optic tectum (<a href=\"#bib24\">Muto et al., 2013</a>). However, the tectum receives input from many different types of RGCs, and responds to a wide variety of stimuli other than prey (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gabriel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Nikolaou et al., 2012</a>), which makes it difficult to determine whether the tectal RGCs are responding selectively to prey. We thus focused our imaging experiments on AFs 1\u20139. We performed two-photon imaging of RGC axons in larvae with the calcium indicator GCaMP6 driven by an RGC-specific promoter. In these larvae, the ten AFs can be identified as distinct regions of fluorescent neuropil (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). We asked whether the axons in any of these regions would respond to the ideal prey stimulus identified in our behavioral assay (3\u00b0, 90\u00b0/s). In our preparation, we could image all but the most ventral arborization field, AF1. We stimulated larvae with the prey stimulus while imaging RGC axons in AFs 2\u20139, and found one area, AF7, whose RGC axons responded robustly to the stimulus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), while seven other AFs did not respond to virtual prey. Some RGC axons in the optic tectum responded to the 3\u00b0 stimulus, but the tectum response was much larger for stimuli of &gt;10\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We next varied the size of the stimulus while imaging in the AF7 plane, and found that AF7 RGC axons responded maximally to dots 2\u20133\u00b0 in diameter, and much less to stimuli larger than 6\u00b0 in diameter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013I</a>). Interestingly, AF9, another AF in the same plane, did not respond to small dots but began to respond as the stimulus size was increased above 6\u00b0 in diameter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>). We also measured the response of AF7 to stimuli of varying speeds, and found that the optimal speed was 90\u00b0/s, and stimuli slower than 12\u00b0/s or faster than 360\u00b0/s evoked a much smaller response in these axons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). These tuning curves are strikingly similar to the behavioral tuning curves for size and speed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, grey trace in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>). At speeds above 360\u00b0/s the strong correlation between behavioral tuning and AF7 response degrades, since the behavioral response to extremely fast speeds is quite low.This could be caused by a threshold or non-linearity in the neural circuit, such as the weak activation of the AF7 RGC axons being insufficient to drive the downstream neurons. We next tested the direction selectivity of the axons in AF7, and found that the area as a whole responded to prey stimuli moving in all four cardinal directions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>), although the response was more robust to stimuli moving horizontally (p &lt; 0.001, <i>t</i>-test)."

We found that head-fixed larvae will perform j-turns and forward swims when paramecia are added to the surrounding medium (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In the absence of paramecia, head-fixed larvae perform spontaneous swims but rarely prey capture (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), while after paramecia were added to the dish we observed frequent prey capture bouts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Like the behavior evoked by virtual prey, these swims could be reliably classified by an SVM. We next asked whether the paramecia were activating AF7 RGC axons. We recorded baseline activity for 30 s and then added a drop of a dense paramecia culture to the petri dish. We found that AF7 RGC axons were strongly activated during the paramecium trials, whereas AF9 axons were not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). When we quantified the \u0394F/F in AF7 and AF9 for nine fish, we found that the peak response was significantly higher in AF7 during trials with paramecia (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). The AF9 peak response in the same larvae was not significantly different in the presence of paramecia. The finding that AF7 axons respond to actual prey supports a role for this area in generating prey capture behavior."

A subpopulation of RGCs has been previously shown to innervate AF7 and the <i>stratum opticum</i> (SO), the most superficial layer of the tectum (<a href=\"#bib46\">Xiao and Baier, 2007</a>). However, little is known about their dendritic morphology, and it is unclear if these are the only inputs to AF7. We set out to characterize the anatomy of the AF7-targeting RGCs using BGUG (<a href=\"#bib46\">Xiao and Baier, 2007</a>), a highly variegated <i>UAS:mGFP</i> reporter that allows the visualization of individual neurons within a Gal4 line. By expressing mCherry and BGUG in RGCs, we labeled most RGCs red and &lt;1% of them green. We could thus identify single RGCs with arbors in AF7 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and trace the axon back to the retina to observe the cell\u2019s dendritic morphology. We identified 19 larvae with an arbor in AF7. All 19 RGCs exhibited the same axonal morphology, projecting to AF7 and the SO, but not to any other AFs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Thus, a prey-specific information channel is routed to two distinct visual areas by each axon. Examining the dendritic morphology of these AF7-targeting RGCs revealed that AF7 receives inputs from two distinct RGC types. Thirteen cells (out of 19) had bistratified arbors with branches in ON and OFF layers of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), and the other six formed diffuse arbors spanning the entire IPL (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These dendritic morphologies correspond to two of the 14 RGC classes previously described in the zebrafish retina (<a href=\"#bib31\">Robles et al., 2014</a>), known as B2 and D1 These two types also project to other AFs, in much smaller numbers. However, the B2 and D1 neurons that project to AF7 only arborize in AF7 and the tectum. The RGC axon responses to prey stimuli in AF7 could be due to either B2 or D1 neurons, or both, as our Gal4 line labels both types."

As a control, we ablated a similarly sized region of AF9. We found that larvae with AF9 ablations spent as much time performing prey capture bouts as before ablation, whereas in AF7-ablated larvae prey capture time was significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). On average, the AF7-ablated larvae spent 40% as much time performing prey capture bouts as they did before the ablation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Although the effect was robust, ablated larvae did perform some prey capture bouts, which could reflect a failure to ablate all AF7 RGC axons, or a contribution from other retinal inputs to the behavior. To confirm that the AF7 ablation did not generally impair visual function, we tested the optomotor response (OMR) before and after ablations in AF7 or AF9. We found that, consistent with previous work (<a href=\"#bib33\">Roeser and Baier, 2003</a>) the OMR was not impaired in AF7-ablated larvae, but was reduced in AF9-ablated larvae (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>).

Our finding that a subset of RGC axons is tuned to prey stimuli suggests that the selectivity is generated early in the visual pathway, by circuits in the retina. There are examples of retinal circuits that generate a similar degree of stimulus selectivity. Experiments in the rabbit have identified local edge detectors\u2014RGCs that respond only to slowly moving targets less than 1\u00b0 in diameter (<a href=\"#bib21\">Levick, 1967</a>), and a similar type has been found in the mouse retina (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). The unusually strong surround suppression in these cells is thought to be a consequence of amacrine cells acting presynaptically to inhibit bipolar cells as well as RGCs (<a href=\"#bib45\">van Wyk et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Russell and Werblin, 2010</a>).

A classic study in the frog found RGCs that responded to small (1\u20133\u00b0) objects moving though the visual field; these cells were hypothesized to act as \u2018bug detectors\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lettvin et al., 1959</a>). These examples show that the retina can perform computations to detect ecologically important objects, allowing RGCs to transmit pre-processed information to the brain to coordinate behavior. Our data support a model in which retinal circuitry confers prey selectivity on a subset of RGCs, which transmit this information to two visual areas in the midbrain: AF7 and the SO layer of the optic tectum."

The PSp is a retinorecipient brain area innervated by RGC axons that also form an arbor in the most superficial retinorecipient layer of the tectum in goldfish (<a href=\"#bib41\">Springer and Mednick, 1985</a>). PSp was one of the two possible adult brain areas suggested for AF7 based on its location in classical dye tracing work (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burrill and Easter, 1994</a>). This nucleus was originally identified as the homologue of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the mammalian thalamus (<a href=\"#bib35\">Schnitzlein, 1962</a>), although this is controversial (<a href=\"#bib26\">Northcutt and Butler, 1976</a>). PSp has been anatomically described in several fish species, and is known to receive topographically organized retinal input (<a href=\"#bib41\">Springer and Mednick, 1985</a>), although little functional information is available. Our group has recently demonstrated that AF7/PSp contains a retinotopic map. Most of the RGCs that project to this area reside in the temporal retina, creating a high-resolution representation of the anterior visual field (<a href=\"#bib31\">Robles et al., 2014</a>). This is the part of the visual environment in which the prey is usually located during prey capture behavior (<a href=\"#bib28\">Patterson et al., 2013</a>)."

One possibility is that tectal neurons are responsible for directing the orienting movements towards a particular point in visual space, while AF7 neurons modulate or gate the tectal output, based on behavioral state (e.g. hunger, arousal). The tectum and its mammalian homologue, the superior colliculus, have been shown to be involved in the transformation of sensory information encoded in terms of visual space into the appropriate motor command (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bergeron et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">du Lac and Knudsen, 1990</a>). The tectum has also been implicated in zebrafish prey capture in several recent studies. Ablation experiments have shown that the tectal neuropil and, more specifically, inhibitory tectal neurons in the most superficial layer play a role in prey capture (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gahtan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Del Bene et al., 2010</a>), and functional imaging experiments have found that tectal neurons are activated by moving paramecia (<a href=\"#bib24\">Muto et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the tectal circuits could translate a prey object\u2019s precise location in visual space into a swimming movement that results in pursuit of the prey."

If the motor map is roughly faithful to the visual map, tectal output neurons in this region could trigger prey capture forward swims. Within the pretectum, the AF7/tectum neurons also have processes in the non-retinorecipient neuropil next to AF7, which most likely corresponds to the magnocellular superficial pretectal nucleus (PSm). We hypothesize that these neurons could be integrating the retinal response to prey with information on behavioral state, and then providing excitatory input to the tectum when appropriate. These AF7 neurons project to a layer of the tectum just ventral to SO, the tectal layer that receives prey-responsive RGC axons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Tectal neurons with dendrites in these superficial layers could thus receive positional information from the raw retinal input in the SO, and excitatory input from the AF7 neurons that would release prey capture behavior only under certain conditions. However, at this point we do not know the response properties or type of neurotransmitter released by these neurons, so we can only speculate as to the input they provide to the tectum."

For example, a GABAergic projection from the basal ganglia to the superior colliculus is thought to act as a gate for the saccade-generating neurons of the superior colliculus, providing tonic inhibition whose cessation releases saccade movements (<a href=\"#bib38\">Shires et al., 2010</a>). Another example of tectal modulation is the local cholinergic and global GABAergic feedback to the tectum provided by the isthmic nuclei in birds (<a href=\"#bib17\">Knudsen, 2011</a>). The focal enhancement by cholinergic input has been shown to be necessary for the transmission of visual information to the area downstream of the tectum (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mar\u00edn et al., 2007</a>). Finally, studies of prey capture in toads have identified a pretectal area that provides inhibitory input to the tectum, resulting in the preference for worm-like prey stimuli (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ewert et al., 2001</a>). The sign of this modulation is opposite to that described in our model, but this might be explained by the different types of stimuli being selected by the two systems (i.e., elongated objects moving in the direction of their long axis, vs small moving circles)."

The nMLF is a cluster of reticulospinal neurons that are involved in controlling swim orientation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Thiele et al., 2014</a>), as well as speed (<a href=\"#bib37\">Severi et al., 2014</a>). Two of the identified nMLF cells, MeLr and MeLc, have also been shown to be necessary for successful prey capture (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gahtan et al., 2005</a>). Projections from AF7 to the nMLF could therefore be involved in generating prey capture tail movements. The hindbrain also plays an important role in locomotion. Neurons in the hindbrain project to the spinal cord, and activation of the caudal hindbrain has been shown to drive swimming behavior (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arrenberg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kimura et al., 2013</a>). Thus far, the tectum has been considered the main output pathway to premotor centers in zebrafish. However, in other systems, multiple areas project to the premotor nuclei and may drive behavior independently or direct different aspects of a behavior; for example, in primates, both the frontal eye fields and the superior colliculus provide input to the brainstem regions controlling eye movements (<a href=\"#bib36\">Scudder et al., 2002</a>). It remains to be seen what role the neurons projecting from AF7 to the nMLF and hindbrain might play in the various components of prey capture behavior."

To avoid testing and training on the same dataset, we used fivefold stratified cross-validation for training (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kohavi, 1995</a>). For this validation, data are split into five groups of approximately equal mean. One group is reserved for testing while the others are used for training, and this procedure is repeated five times before the results are combined. We quantified 16 parameters for each bout. A radial basis function (RBF) kernel shape was used to draw the decision boundaries. A subset of the 16 parameters was selected by plotting the accuracy vs number of parameters. The point that maximized performance while minimizing the number of parameters was selected. For the virtual prey SVM, five parameters were optimal (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Since bright ambient light was required to allow the larvae to see the paramecia, we performed these imaging experiments on a confocal microscope (Zeiss 780) rather than a two-photon. Time series were acquired at a rate of 3.3 Hz and a resolution of 128 \u00d7 128 pixels. Experiments were performed with overhead lights on and a white LED illuminating the dish to enhance the visibility of the prey. Temporal series of the same field of view with and without paramecia were joined together. The resulting stack was registered with StackReg in Fiji to reduce motion artifacts and pixel misalignment between the two acquisitions. From the raw data, \u0394F/F was computed pixel-wise by a custom Matlab routine. Because we did not know when a paramecium was within the field of view, we calculated the baseline F for each pixel as the value of that pixel during a period of low activity. This was defined as the eighth percentile of the pixel's fluorescence over a sliding window of 25 frames. Maximum intensity projections of \u0394F/F, computed independently for the two segments of the stack (before and after addition of paramecia), were divided to give the \u0394F/F ratio between the two conditions for the pseudocolor image shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>. From the \u0394F/F maximum intensity projections, the average values over regions of interest corresponding to AF7 and AF9 were computed to compare the activity between the two arborization fields. During the 30 s windows we imaged over, occasional responses were observed in AF7 and AF9 in the absence of paramecia added to the bath. This could be the result of spontaneous activity, or small objects, for example bubbles or debris, floating in the solution."

We found that treating the larvae with 0.1 mM PTU starting at 1 dpf was helpful in preventing tissue damage during ablation. Axons were killed by scanning an 850 nm beam for 750 ms over a 3 \u00d7 3 \u00b5M area. Post-objective laser power was 80 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. 4\u20135 scans were usually sufficient to ablate the AF7 neuropil. A Z stack of the area was taken 24 hr later to assess completeness of the ablation, and larvae with less than 80% of the volume ablated bilaterally were not used for the analysis. As a control, we ablated a similar volume of AF9 neuropil, with 4\u20135 scans."

Elimination of ganglion cell input to this pretectal area, AF7, strongly reduces prey capture behavior. These observations point to an initial sensory pathway that is focused on stimuli that represent prey and convey visual signals to AF7. The authors also attempt to anatomically link the sensory AF7 pathway with brainstem motor command systems. Altogether the authors suggest that they have identified a dedicated sensorimotor pathway for prey detection and capture in larval zebrafish."

The importance of study is that it appears to be the first time that feature selective ganglion cells activity has been linked to prey capture behavior outside the tectum. The less convincing part of the study is the link to motor output pathways. Moreover, the results appear to be oversold in places with too strong conclusions based on the available data. It is recommended that the authors' focus on what can clearly be said based on strong evidence and tone down strong statements and discussions based on weak evidence. The details are outlined below in addition to other points for improvements of the manuscript."

As shown in the Results section, deletion of input to AF7 only reduces the prey capture behavior. Hence, it is not necessary. If the animals can do the prey capture behavior at all without the region then it is cannot be said to be \u201crequired\u201d. A balanced discussion for the lack of necessity is required."
