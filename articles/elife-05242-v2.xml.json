Recently, we showed that cilium-generated signaling in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> induced rapid, anterograde IFT-independent, cytoplasmic microtubule-dependent redistribution of the membrane polypeptide, SAG1-C65, from the plasma membrane to the periciliary region and the ciliary membrane. Here, we report that the retrograde IFT motor, cytoplasmic dynein 1b, is required in the cytoplasm for this rapid redistribution. Furthermore, signaling-induced trafficking of SAG1-C65 into cilia is unidirectional and the entire complement of cellular SAG1-C65 is shed during signaling and can be recovered in the form of ciliary ectosomes that retain signal-inducing activity. Thus, during signaling, cells regulate ciliary membrane protein composition through cytoplasmic action of the retrograde IFT motor and shedding of ciliary ectosomes."

Recently, we showed that cilium-generated signaling in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> induced rapid, anterograde IFT-independent, cytoplasmic microtubule-dependent redistribution of the membrane polypeptide, SAG1-C65, from the plasma membrane to the periciliary region and the ciliary membrane. Here, we report that the retrograde IFT motor, cytoplasmic dynein 1b, is required in the cytoplasm for this rapid redistribution. Furthermore, signaling-induced trafficking of SAG1-C65 into cilia is unidirectional and the entire complement of cellular SAG1-C65 is shed during signaling and can be recovered in the form of ciliary ectosomes that retain signal-inducing activity. Thus, during signaling, cells regulate ciliary membrane protein composition through cytoplasmic action of the retrograde IFT motor and shedding of ciliary ectosomes."

This ciliary touching activates signals that are sent into the cells to get them ready to fuse together, much like sperm and egg cells do in animals."

However, Cao, Ning, Hernandez-Lara et al. found that this dynein also carries SAG1-C65 from the membrane of the cells towards the base of the cilia in preparation for it to enter into these structures."

Instead, SAG1-C65 was packaged within tiny bubble-like structures near the tips of cilia and these packages were then shed from cilia into the external environment. This discovery challenges a widely held view that proteins are only removed from cilia by returning to the cell. Future work will be required to understand more of the molecular details of these processes, which are likely to be present in most cells with cilia."

Initiated by discoveries in chemosensation in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, of ciliary defects in polycystic kidney disease, and of the central role of cilia in the vertebrate hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, we now know that the organelle is a signaling node for multiple pathways in development, disease, and homeostasis (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib14\">Gerdes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lancaster and Gleeson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</a>).

The working model for delivery of ciliary membrane proteins during ciliogenesis is that vesicles derived from the Golgi and containing newly synthesized membrane proteins destined for the cilium traffic via as yet poorly characterized motors to specialized regions of the plasma membrane near the base of the organelle, including the ciliary pocket (<a href=\"#bib32\">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rohatgi and Snell, 2010</a>), and enter the cilium as the organelle elongates.

Several proteins and protein complexes are involved in trafficking of membrane proteins to the organelle during its formation as well as in establishing the barrier, and their mutational disruption leads to aberrant regulation of constitutively localized ciliary membrane proteins, or to complete absence of cilia and to the ciliopathies (<a href=\"#bib13\">Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hildebrandt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Williams et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chih et al., 2012</a>)."

Concomitantly, both Ptch and GPR161 are depleted from the organelle. Although several models have been proposed to account for the fascinating, dynamic, regulated enrichment and loss of Hh effectors in the ciliary membrane, we still know few mechanistic details."

In addition to activating the signaling pathway within each type of gamete, interactions between the SAG1 <i>plus</i> agglutinin and the SAD1 <i>minus</i> agglutinin cause the cilia of the gametes to adhere to each other, thereby bringing the gametes into the close contact required for gamete fusion."

We found that although small amounts of SAG1-C65 were on the cilia of resting <i>plus</i> gametes, most was excluded from the organelles and present at the plasma membrane. When the cilium-generated signaling pathway was activated, however, the C-terminal SAG1-C65 polypeptide was rapidly recruited to the ciliary membrane through a mechanism that did not require the anterograde IFT motor kinesin 2/FLA10. Moreover, before entering the cilium during signaling, SAG1-C65 became highly polarized, accumulating in the periciliary region as part of a ciliary entry pathway that required cytoplasmic microtubules. Here, we report that during cilium-generated signaling, cells regulate ciliary membrane SAG1-C65 levels by action of the retrograde IFT motor in the cytoplasm and by regulated shedding of SAG1-C65-containing ciliary ectosomes that retain signaling competency and comprise a distinct membrane compartment."

The benzoyl dihydroquinazolinone, ciliobrevin D, has been shown in metazoans to block cytoplasmic dyneins (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hyman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Firestone et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Ye et al., 2013</a>). And, recently <a href=\"#bib48\">Shih et al. (2013)</a> showed that ciliobrevin D inhibition of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cytoplasmic dynein 1b (DHC1b) strongly reduced retrograde IFT. We tested for a role of the retrograde IFT motor in SAG1-C65 redistribution during signaling using ciliobrevin D. Early during ciliary adhesion and cilium-generated signaling, activation of a ciliary adenylyl cyclase leads to an \u223c15-fold increase in cellular cAMP that activates gametes to prepare for fusion. Thus, it is possible to study cellular events activated by the signaling pathway, such as redistribution of the agglutinin polypeptide, release of cell walls, and upregulation of transcripts for gamete-specific proteins, in gametes of a single mating type by incubating them in the cell-permeable analogue, db-cAMP (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pijst et al., 1984b</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pasquale and Goodenough, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Goodenough, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hunnicutt et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Belzile et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ning et al., 2013</a>).

Cilia of resting gametes contained little SAG1-C65-HA as assessed by both IF and immunoblotting of isolated cilia, but upon 5-min incubation in db-cAMP, SAG1-C65-HA in the organelles increased in control, but not in the ciliobrevin samples (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>, upper panels). The effects of ciliobrevin D were transient, and cells washed out of the inhibitor rapidly regained the ability to respond to db-cAMP by accumulating SAG1-C65-HA in their cilia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). IF analysis showed that the array of cytoplasmic microtubules was unaffected by ciliobrevin D (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). And, the inhibitor had no effect on total cellular SAG1-C65-HA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lower panels). Interestingly, and consistent with the IF results that ciliobrevin D treatment of resting cells reduced the percent with apical localization of SAG1-C65-HA, the basal level of SAG1-C65-HA in cilia isolated from ciliobrevin D-treated resting gametes was lower than in the control, resting gametes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We also examined whether the inhibitor blocked signaling per se, by testing its affects on signaling-induced phosphorylation of the homeodomain protein, GSP1 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wilson et al., 1999</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, gametes in ciliobrevin D remained capable of responding to db-cAMP as assessed by the phosphorylation-related change in migration of GSP1 in immunoblots (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wilson et al., 1999</a>). Thus, apical localization and ciliary enrichment of SAG1-C65 during signaling were both inhibited by the cytoplasmic dynein inhibitor, ciliobrevin D, indicating that the retrograde IFT motor acts in the cytoplasm to enrich SAG1-C65 in the peri-ciliary region concomitant with entry of the protein into the ciliary membrane."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> (upper panels), cells indeed released SAG1-C65-HA into the medium during receptor-activated signaling. Moreover, the amount recovered in the medium after 3 hr was three times as much as present in the starting cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), indicating that the relatively constant levels of cell body and ciliary SAG1-C65-HA during sustained agglutinin receptor interactions and signaling reflected a dynamic balance between synthesis, ciliary delivery, and release from the cilia. Moreover, when the cells were mixed together in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, nearly 75% of the SAG1-HA in the cells at T = 0 was recovered in the medium after 3 hr of receptor-activated signaling, demonstrating that release was the major fate of the protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, lower panels and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Consistent with the results above, SAG1-C65-HA was absent from the medium of adhering gametes in which signaling and ciliary recruitment of SAG1-C65-HA were blocked by the addition of staurosporine (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). On the other hand, compared to control <i>SAG1-HA</i> gametes undergoing receptor-activated signaling induced by mixing them with <i>hap2 minus</i> gametes, <i>SAG1-HA</i> gametes that had been activated by pre-incubating them with db-cAMP and then mixed with <i>hap2</i> gametes, released increased amounts of SAG1-C65-HA into the medium, even when staurosporine was also added to the medium (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

Some of the vesicles were in clusters, but many were single vesicles in intimate association with the ciliary membrane. Formation of vesicles during ciliary adhesion was unique to cilia, and we did not observe vesicles associated with the cell body surface of the gametes.

Use of both a retrograde IFT motor mutant, <i>fla24</i> and the cytoplasmic dynein 1b inhibitor, ciliobrevin D, showed that the signaling-triggered rapid polarization of SAG1-C65-HA and its entry into the ciliary membrane were inhibited when motor function was impaired (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

The increased amounts of SAG1-C65-HA in the cilia of resting <i>fla24</i> gametes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>) also indicated that the retrograde motor is important for membrane protein trafficking during the ciliogenesis that accompanies gamete formation. In their studies of a conditional DHC1b mutant, <i>dhc1b-3</i>, <a href=\"#bib10\">Engel et al. (2012)</a> found several differences in ciliary protein composition compared to wild-type. Whether the increased amount of SAG1-C65-HA in the <i>fla24</i> cilia reflects a direct or indirect role for the retrograde motor in regulating ciliary membrane protein composition is unclear (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ocbina et al., 2011</a>). Although several membrane-associated proteins and protein complexes are strongly implicated in targeting ciliary membrane proteins to the periciliary region in many cell types (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nachury et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wood and Rosenbaum, 2014</a>), the motors that carry ciliary-destined membrane proteins to the base of the organelle have been largely unidentified. One notable exception is photoreceptor cells in which cytoplasmic dynein 1 (not the retrograde IFT motor) is involved in trafficking of rod outer segment membrane proteins from the golgi to the base of the connecting cilium (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tai et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kong et al., 2013</a>)."

On the other hand, the parent compound of ciliobrevin D, HPI-4, inhibited Hh-induced ciliary accumulation of Smoothened by 60\u201370% 12 hr after addition of the Hh ligand, raising the possibility that a cytoplasmic dynein is involved in trafficking of Smoothened to the cilium in metazoans (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hyman et al., 2009</a>). And <a href=\"#bib63\">Ye et al.

It will be interesting to determine whether ciliary growth in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> depends on cargo transport along cytoplasmic microtubules by cytoplasmic dynein 1b. Given that growth of new cilia is dependent on anterograde IFT, whereas signaling-induced movement of pre-existing SAG1-C65-HA into existing cilia is independent of anterograde IFT, it may be that cells use one membrane protein trafficking modality for ciliary assembly and a different one for regulated ciliary enrichment of pre-existing membrane proteins."

The recent work of <a href=\"#bib8\">Dentler (2013)</a> showed that vegetative cells shed over 15% of their ciliary membrane per hr, and that the protein composition of the constitutively shed membrane vesicles was similar to that of the ciliary membrane per se. In our current studies, however, resting gametes did not shed SAG1-C65-containing ciliary ectosomes, but shedding of such ectosomes required receptor interactions and signaling. It is likely that the vesicles <a href=\"#bib17\">Goodenough and Heuser (1999)</a> observed 25 years ago on adhering cilia corresponded to those we isolated from the medium. Notably, the shed vesicles we isolated were enriched in SAG1-C65-HA and de-enriched in the 350 kDa major membrane protein compared to cilia. And, nearly the entire cellular complement of pre-existing SAG1-C65-HA was shed in \u223c3 hr. Thus, receptor signaling-induced shedding of SAG1-C65-containing ciliary ectosomes was much more rapid and selective than the previously reported, constitutive shedding of ciliary membrane vesicles, and likely depends on a mechanism distinct from that used for constitutive shedding."

In future studies, it will be interesting to determine if the integral membrane polypeptide SAG1-C65 is the membrane anchor for the agglutinin polypeptide, which lacks predicted transmembrane domains. These considerations lead to the model that release of ciliary ectosomes during ciliary adhesion and signaling underlies the dynamic nature of ciliary adhesion evidenced by constant cilia adhesion and de-adhesion within mixtures of <i>plus</i> and <i>minus</i> gametes. From another perspective, because the released ectosomes retain biological activity, their formation might help to maximize the probability of zygote formation."

Regulating the membrane protein composition of the cilium is a central feature of cilium-dependent signaling. Current models posit that regulation of ciliary membrane protein composition is controlled by bidirectional flow of membrane proteins from the cell body to the cilium and back. Direct evidence has been lacking, however, that ciliary membrane proteins lost from the cilium during signaling actually return to the cell, because of the difficulty in determining the fate of ciliary proteins in most systems. Our results demonstrate that cells can maintain a steady-state level of a ciliary membrane protein by unidirectional flow (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) in which proteins move from the cell body to the cilium and then into the extracellular milieu."

Last summer we had initiated a collaboration with Dr. Susan Dutcher to introduce SAG1-HA into her dynein heavy chain 1b (DHC1b) temperature sensitive mutant, <i>fla24</i> (Lin et al., Cilia, 2:14, 2013), but we did not have the results until recently. Because we had those strains in hand, we have used them for the experiments in the revised manuscript instead of the <i>dhc1b-3</i> ts mutant described in <a href=\"#bib10\">Engel, JCB, 2012</a>, that was suggested in your letter. The phenotype of <i>fla24</i> is quite similar to that of <i>dhc1b-3</i>. The levels of DHC1b and the light intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein 1b, D1bLIC, are substantively depleted in both <i>fla24</i> and <i>dhc1b-3</i>, even at the permissive temperature. The extent of depletion was not quantified by Engels et al., but the amount of depletion shown in their blots appeared to be similar to that of Lin et al., who reported a 16-fold reduction compared to wild type of both proteins at the permissive temperature. Thus, both \u201cts\u201d mutations in DHC1b lead to significant instability and degradation of the protein at the \u201cpermissive temperature\u201d, and we carried out our experiments at the permissive temperature. As we indicate in the manuscript, the resting <i>SAG1-HAfla24</i> gametes have relatively large amounts of SAG1-C65-HA in their cilia at the permissive temperature compared to wild type, indicating that the retrograde IFT motor functions in membrane protein trafficking during the cilia formation that accompanies gametogenesis and possibly during ciliary maintenance in resting gametes. Importantly, though, SAG1-C65-HA apical redistribution and ciliary entry upon db-cAMP activation were blocked in the DHC1b-depleted <i>fla24</i> gametes."

We used conventional blotting methods and ImageJ for our analysis under conditions in which the amount of protein loaded was proportional to the band intensities. We have omitted the PKG results because of a higher molecular mass, cross-reactive band of unknown origin that interfered with our analysis. We feel it would take a substantial amount of time to determine whether the higher mw band is a multimer of PKG or an artifact. Since the blots show that several ciliary proteins are substantially decreased and we quantify FMG1 de-enrichment, we do not feel that omission of PKG changes the interpretation or conclusions. We agree that it might be interesting to use TEM to quantify amounts of vesicles associated with cilia during release and when we add them back to cells. These are highly dynamic processes, and to avoid variation, we took samples at consistent times. Of course, there was some variability from experiment to experiment, but the TEM experiments were carried out multiple times by two of us, and the electron micrographs in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4 and 5</a> are representative of typical amounts of vesicles we observed. To obtain full information about vesicles per cilium would require an extensive analysis at many time points, and, with the variability\u2019s inherent in using unfixed samples and negative staining, we are just not sure that such an analysis would add important new information not already provided by the existing TEM and by our biochemical analysis."
