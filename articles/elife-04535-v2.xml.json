Although most of the protein components of the endocytic protein machinery have been thoroughly characterized, their organization at the endocytic site is poorly understood. We developed a fluorescence microscopy method to track the average positions of yeast endocytic proteins in relation to each other with a time precision below 1 s and with a spatial precision of \u223c10 nm. With these data, integrated with shapes of endocytic membrane intermediates and with superresolution imaging, we could visualize the dynamic architecture of the endocytic machinery. We showed how different coat proteins are distributed within the coat structure and how the assembly dynamics of N-BAR proteins relate to membrane shape changes. Moreover, we found that the region of actin polymerization is located at the base of the endocytic invagination, with the growing ends of filaments pointing toward the plasma membrane."

Although most of the protein components of the endocytic protein machinery have been thoroughly characterized, their organization at the endocytic site is poorly understood. We developed a fluorescence microscopy method to track the average positions of yeast endocytic proteins in relation to each other with a time precision below 1 s and with a spatial precision of \u223c10 nm. With these data, integrated with shapes of endocytic membrane intermediates and with superresolution imaging, we could visualize the dynamic architecture of the endocytic machinery. We showed how different coat proteins are distributed within the coat structure and how the assembly dynamics of N-BAR proteins relate to membrane shape changes. Moreover, we found that the region of actin polymerization is located at the base of the endocytic invagination, with the growing ends of filaments pointing toward the plasma membrane."

Clathrin molecules and many other proteins bind together to make a lattice-like coat that causes the membrane to curve inwards and form a pocket that contains the cargo.

It is involved in numerous different biological contexts from the generation of cellular polarization, to virus uptake and the regulation of neural signaling. The formation of clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles is driven by a complex molecular machinery composed of more than 50 different proteins (<a href=\"#bib19\">Doherty and McMahon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boettner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Weinberg and Drubin, 2012</a>). These proteins recruit cargo molecules and reshape the plasma membrane to generate the endocytic vesicle. The assembly dynamics of the endocytic protein machinery has been described in detail by live-cell imaging (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gaidarov et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Merrifield et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kaksonen et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Newpher et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sirotkin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Loerke et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Taylor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cocucci et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berro and Pollard, 2014</a>). However, the spatial organization of the endocytic proteins during vesicle budding remains poorly understood. The complexity and the size of the endocytic machinery, below the resolution limit of light microscopy, have made it challenging to reveal how the endocytic proteins are organized during vesicle budding."

                        "text": "Budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> has been used extensively as a model organism to study endocytosis. The protein machinery of clathrin-mediated endocytosis is largely conserved between mammals and yeast (<a href=\"#bib17\">Conibear, 2010</a>). In yeast, endocytosis starts with the recruitment of clathrin and several clathrin adaptors and accessory proteins to the plasma membrane to initiate the assembly of the vesicle coat (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carroll et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Godlee and Kaksonen, 2013</a>). During this initial early phase, which can last between 40 and 90 s, the coat assembles on a flat plasma membrane and cargo molecules are recruited to the endocytic site<b>.</b> Later, additional coat proteins and actin interactors are recruited. The actin interactors include Las17 (homolog of mammalian N-WASP) and type I myosins Myo3 and Myo5, which both activate the actin filament nucleating Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib78\">Winter et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Evangelista et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lechler et al., 2000</a>). In yeast, the invagination of the plasma membrane, and the consequent inward movement of the coat, is concomitant with the appearance of actin at the endocytic site (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kukulski et al., 2012</a>). A functional dependence on actin polymerization is possibly due to high turgor pressure (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough, 2009</a>). In mammals, actin is similarly critical under conditions of high membrane tension (<a href=\"#bib11\">Boulant et al., 2011</a>). Two of the coat-associated proteins, Sla2 (homolog of mammalian Hip1R) and the epsin Ent1, interact directly with lipids, clathrin and actin, and are essential for mediating the forces from the actin cytoskeleton to deform the membrane (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baggett et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sun et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Skruzny et al., 2012</a>). The shape of the endocytic invagination is regulated by proteins containing BAR domains, such as the Rvs161/167 heterodimer, which are localized at the neck region of the membrane invagination (<a href=\"#bib31\">Idrissi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Youn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kishimoto et al., 2011</a>). After vesicle scission the endocytic machinery quickly disassembles and the free vesicle is trafficked further into the cell."

These three proteins represent different endocytic substructures: the coat (Sla2), the invagination neck (Rvs167) and the actin cytoskeleton (Abp1) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kaksonen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Idrissi et al., 2008</a>). We generated aligned average trajectories and measured the average number of molecules for the proteins tagged N-terminally (GFP-Sla2) or C-terminally (Rvs167-GFP and Abp1-GFP; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). We first defined a common frame by setting the initial position of the Sla2 centroid to coincide with the position of the flat plasma membrane. In GFP-Sla2 the GFP molecule is adjacent to Sla2's lipid-binding ANTH domain. The binding of Sla2's ANTH domain to PIP<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane is essential for productive endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sun et al., 2005</a>). We could therefore assume that before membrane bending starts (first time point in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>) the centroid of GFP-Sla2 is likely to be within few nm from the plasma membrane surface, whose position we took as the origin of the position axis. We then calculated the positions of the center of mass of Sla2 molecules on the shapes of the different membrane intermediates taking into account that Sla2 molecules cover a \u223c30\u201340 nm long region at the tip of the invagination (<a href=\"#bib30\">Idrissi et al., 2012</a>). We used these positions to shift the membrane intermediates in time so that they coincided with the centroids in the average trajectory of GFP-Sla2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>)."

With our estimate of the numbers of Rvs167 molecules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), such density yields the possible membrane area covered by the Rvs dimers, assuming that all dimers are membrane bound. We then used the Rvs167 average trajectory to locate the area of the membrane profiles covered by Rvs. These simple assumptions allowed us to generate a dynamic model of the membrane area covered by the Rvs molecules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019; see also <a href=\"#bib2\">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</a> for a similar approach).

                                "text": "The mechanism by which the polymerizing actin filaments contribute to membrane invagination is poorly understood. Different models have been suggested, but there is no conclusive data in favor of any of them (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaksonen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Merrifield, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Suetsugu, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Collins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Idrissi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mooren et al., 2012</a>). <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> summarizes three possible models for the organization of actin filaments at the endocytic site. In the first model the polymerizing ends of actin filaments are growing against the coat, thereby pushing it inward. In the second model filaments are growing against the plasma membrane at the base of the invagination, and the older filaments are connected to the coat to mediate the pushing force. In the third model actin polymerization is not preferentially oriented. In all models, the centroid of labeled actin would move similarly inward during endocytosis and thus could not be used to discriminate between the models. However, the models can be distinguished if the centroid is tracked after local photobleaching, because the location of the centroid is then determined by the fluorescence of the newly polymerized filaments. Model 1 predicts that after photobleaching the centroid would jump inward, away from the cell surface. Model 2 predicts a jump in the opposite direction, toward the cell surface, while model 3 predicts no jump. The centroid positions at later time points should be parallel to the reference trajectory, and be shifted by the distance of the post-bleach jump (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

Multiple trajectories were averaged and plotted with the average trajectory of the unbleached patch, as a comparison. We first photobleached GFP-Act1 patches \u223c3\u20134 s after their appearance. After photobleaching the reappearing centroids were located closer to the plasma membrane than the centroids at the corresponding time point in the unbleached average trajectory (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Neighbor trajectories to the photobleaching site, which were only partially affected by photobleaching, did not show any jump (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

In yeast, the heterodimeric BAR domain proteins Rvs161/167 assemble transiently at the endocytic site during the formation of the membrane invagination (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kaksonen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Idrissi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kukulski et al., 2012</a>) to regulate the invagination or scission steps (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kaksonen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Youn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kishimoto et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Boucrot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kukulski et al., 2012</a>). However, the exact mechanism of action of Rvs is unknown. Our results suggest that there are enough Rvs molecules to form a dense BAR domain lattice covering the whole tubular part of the invagination below the coated tip (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). At this density the Rvs proteins could exert significant bending forces on the membrane (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sorre et al., 2012</a>). This Rvs lattice could therefore support the membrane tubule and prevent premature fission (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kukulski et al., 2012</a>). In addition, an Rvs lattice could act as a lipid diffusion barrier that could form a lipid phase boundary to promote vesicle scission (<a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, our model explains the rapid movement of the Rvs167-GFP centroid upon scission: due to their affinity for curved membranes, the Rvs molecules are likely to first disassemble at the tubular part of the invagination that collapses after scission, while some of the Rvs molecules may remain bound to the membrane that forms the vesicle. Therefore, the center of mass of Rvs molecules would rapidly shift due to localized disassembly without actual movement of the Rvs lattice. The exact timing of the Rvs disassembly, in respect to the scission event, remains an interesting open question. Currently, our data does not have the time resolution to discern whether the initiation of Rvs disassembly precedes scission or follows it. If Rvs disassembly follows scission it could be a passive response to the collapse of the membrane tubule. Alternatively, if Rvs disassembly precedes scission it might destabilize the membrane tubule and thereby regulate the timing of scission. In either case, the extensive Rvs lattice could support the membrane tubule and thereby promote its extension until the scission."

If each Arp2/3 complex nucleates an actin filament, new filaments are generated at a rate of \u223c30 filaments per second, reaching a maximum number of \u223c200 filaments. With the estimated maximum of \u223c3000 actin molecules the average filament length would be \u223c40 nm. The actin polymer, the Arp2/3 complex, and the Arp2/3 activators, Myo5 and Las17, reach the maximum level of molecules about 2 s before vesicle scission. Actin and the Arp2/3 complex maintain their levels of molecules until scission, whereas Las17 and Myo5 start to disassemble right after reaching their peak levels. These data suggest that the rate of nucleation of new actin filaments decreases before vesicle scission occurs. The initiation of actin filament nucleation has been studied extensively (<a href=\"#bib51\">Mooren et al., 2012</a>), but the mechanisms that terminate nucleation are not well understood.

During this time window the flat plasma membrane is reshaped into an endocytic vesicle. The coat, which is initially assembled on flat membrane, starts internalizing and reorganizing when actin polymerization begins. Actin polymerization is initiated close to the plasma membrane where Las17 is located and the region of polymerization remains at the base of the invagination throughout vesicle budding. When the invagination has formed, actin is likely polymerizing in a circular region surrounding the invagination. Initially, actin polymerization might also be triggered in a circular region at the rim of the coat, where Sla1, a regulator of actin nucleation, is also located. Continued filament nucleation and polymerization at the plasma membrane would push the older filaments into the cell generating a flow of actin filaments. The organization of the endocytic actin network bears striking similarity to the organization of actin at the leading edge of migrating animal cells where actin filaments nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex polymerize and push against the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</a>). This polymerization pushes the leading edge of the cell forward, but also results in a retrograde flow of actin filaments into the cell. The actin binding domains of Sla2 are ideally positioned at the surface of the endocytic coat to capture the actin filaments that are moving away from the plasma membrane. We suggest that the actin scaffold is rigid enough to transmit the forces produced by the polymerization at the plasma membrane so that Sla2 can, together with Ent1 (<a href=\"#bib64\">Skruzny et al., 2012</a>), transmit the force from the actin polymerization to the membrane."

Cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature on the ConA coated coverslip and then washed with SC-Trp medium. Cells were imaged on the coverslip in 40 \u00b5l of SC-Trp medium. All samples were imaged at room temperature using an Olympus IX81 wide-field epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100\u00d7/1.45 objective. For single channel live cell imaging 488 nm laser light and images were acquired with 80\u2013100 ms exposure time. Emission light was filtered using the GFP-3035C-OMF single-band filter set (Semrock, Rochester, NY). Fluorescence was detected using the Hamamatsu ImagEM EMCCD camera. For two color live cell imaging the samples were excited simultaneously with 488 nm and 561 nm laser light for 250 ms exposure. Excitation light was reflected with a OBS-U-M2TIR 488/561 (Semrock, Rochester, NY) dichroic mirror. Emission light was split and filtered with the DUAL-view (Optical Insights, LLC, Tucson, AZ) beam splitter. The beam splitter created two separated images, one for each channel, on the Hamamatsu ImagEM EMCCD camera sensor. Photobleaching was performed using a custom built setup with a 488 nm laser, focused on a \u223c0.5 \u00b5m spot."

To correct for the uneven cytoplasmic background signal at the edge of the cell, we estimated the cytoplasmic contribution by further processing the images with a median filter (of kernel 6 pixels, corresponding to 0.6 \u00b5m).

The weights <i>w</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> are the product of the fluorescence intensities of the spot pairs at each time point. Being proportional to the cross-correlation in time of the fluorescence intensities, they helped to refine the temporal alignment of the trajectories. To not bias the alignment by the choice of a reference, each trajectory was separately used as a reference to which all the remaining trajectories were aligned. Given <i>n</i> trajectories we thus computed <i>n(n\u22121)</i> alignments. Each alignment gave us an estimate of the transformation that aligns a trajectory to its reference. We thus estimated the average transformation that aligns all the trajectories together as seen from a common reference point in the field of view. Once aligned, all trajectories were averaged to obtain the average trajectory.

Simultaneous acquisition of the two colors is made with the DUAL-view beam splitter (Optical Insights, LLC, Tucson, AZ). Image un-splitting and correction of chromatic aberration are done following the DUAL-view recommended procedures. A sample with TetraSpeck microsphere (0.1 \u00b5m, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was imaged in both channels and the centroids were identified with Particle Tracker (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos, 2005</a>) in ImageJ and then processed in MATLAB (TheMathworks, Natick, MA) to generate a spatial warping transformation that was applied on the raw coordinates. The non-linear transformation was generated by the local weighted mean (lwm) method of cp2tform (See Matlab help and references thereafter)."

The points of the trajectory pairs were randomly generated and were normally distributed around the ground truth trajectories with sigma <i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> for the trajectories of the target protein and <i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>r</i></sub> for the trajectories of the reference protein. All trajectories were generated with the same sampling rate as the real trajectories. The virtual trajectory pairs were then processed with the same pipeline we used for the real data to align the ground truth trajectories together. As the ground truth trajectories were already aligned all transformations are expected to be 0 (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013D</a>). When we arbitrarily increased the noise used to generate both the reference and the target proteins we observed that the alignment procedure remains faithful up to \u223c25 nm of noise. For higher values a small systematic shift occurs (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). We then tested the robustness of the alignment procedure keeping <i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>r</i></sub> fixed at 19 nm while we varied <i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>p</i></sub>. A <i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>r</i></sub> fixed mimics the noise in the real trajectory pairs, as the reference protein was always imaged under the same conditions. The alignment showed negligible errors (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E\u2013L</a>). Note that in the real trajectory pairs <i>\u03c3</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> span a range from 10 nm to 24 nm, however the algorithm was stable also for higher errors. We observed a systematic shift, of maximally \u223c3 nm, that occurs when the trajectories are getting far from the reference (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3K</a>). This is expected as any small error in the alignment of the trajectories leads to an underestimate of the separation between the reference and the target protein. This underestimate grows larger the bigger the separation is, resulting in the trajectory of the target protein being shifted little closer to its reference than it should be. A shift of 3 nm is reached when the trajectories are 30 nm away far from the reference protein, which is the maximal distance of a trajectory from its reference in our model."

These shifts simulate different amounts of aberration between the two channels. On average, the alignment is not affected (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). In fact, the trajectory pairs, as well as the endocytic events that they mimic, are oriented in all possible directions and once their average relative position is calculated, the chromatic aberration contribution is averaged out. However, the incertitude in the average position increases, as expected (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). It is important to note that our pixel size correspond to 100 nm, therefore any shift larger than 50\u2013100 nm would have been easily noticeable by eye. To assess how the alignment of the real data would be affected by a systematic color shift we also shifted the real trajectory pairs we used to align Sla2-GFP tp Abp1-GFP. Again, we induced shifts up to 150 nm to the trajectories of Abp1-mCherry to simulate different amounts of aberration between the two channels. The average position of Sla2-GFP does not significantly change but the incertitude in its average position increases (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B\u2013D</a>)."

After alignment, the photobleached trajectories were thus aligned in space and time with all the average trajectories and with the plasma membrane profiles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013F</a>)."

The authors used a centroid-based estimation of localization. Since the number of molecules on the clathrin coated vesicles CCV is in the range of 50-100 and the CCV have a regular shape, the center of mass of molecules can be localized with a few nm accuracy. The authors used mCherry labeled Abp1 as a base line and aligned other components of the endocytic machinery relative to Abp1 in space and time. This approach yielded a comprehensive description of the primary events occurring during CME in yeast."

Since the method provides the time resolved behavior of the center of mass, the more detailed spatial organization of molecules on CCV was studied by CLEM (correlation of light microscopy with EM) and super-resolution microscopy. Using this approach, the authors describe the order of assembly and movement of the CCV proteins during invagination. The FRAP experiments allowed them to discriminate between different models of actin polymerization."

In addition, even with an accurate procedure, every computer-based procedure will in all likelihood contain some implementation bugs. Therefore, its accuracy has to be tested in well controlled experiments."

I do not wish to dispute the fact that the quantitative analysis of CCV assembly and invagination is an important contribution. However, such a thorough analysis should also translate into some significant conceptual advances to merit publication in <i>eLife</i>. This is not apparent from this study. There are a number of potentially interesting points that the authors make, such as the specific orientation of coat-associated proteins, the order of proteins (e.g. Sla1 and End3) assembly, the formation of a BAR domain lattice on the tubular part of the invagination, the predicted bending forces exerted on the membrane, the activation and termination of actin filaments nucleation prior to and following vesicle scission. My impression however is that these are only incremental advances more than a true discovery."

Were the tracks of Abp1-mCherry and of the GFP-proteins aligned independently of each other? I do not find it logical that a two-step alignment has higher accuracy than a single step alignment, against what the authors claim. All additional procedures have to increase uncertainty. In the case of doubling the number of measurements, the uncertainty decreases only by a factor square root of 2.

The curve on <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> raises the question of whether a fraction of Rvs has to be on the plasma membrane side of the scission neck. After cutting the neck the membranes with Rvs move to opposite directions, with the vesicular part moving towards the interior and the PM part moving retrogradely. One could expect that it will be reflected in an oscillatory behavior of centroid with mean position in the center of the neck and high level of uncertainty. Unfortunately, this process is below the time resolution of the authors' technique. The curve on <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> shows a fast shift toward the vesicle. The authors commented that Rvs persists 2 sec longer on the vesicle than the plasma membrane. But another possible explanation is that a larger fraction of Rvs localized above the scission plane, something that would be inconsistent with the cartoon on <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>.

While tails were first described at sites of non-clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Merriefield and Almers, PMID: 10559868), a recent <i>eLife</i> paper demonstrated that also clathrin coated vesicles nucleate actin tails when the dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 is impaired (Nandez et al., PMID: 25107275). Thus, while the present study proves what had been implicit in previous studies, i.e. that actin nucleation occurs at the base of the invagination, could some actin eventually nucleate also from the newly formed vesicle (for example at the site of the scar left by the fission)? The authors show that a pool of Rvs remains partially associated with the vesicle and one wonders whether some actin nucleating factors may be present at the same site."

This work favors the idea that the initial deformation coincides with the nucleation of actin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), in line with the view presented in Kukulski, et al. (2012). The stronger evidence in favor of this model is that in the presence of Latrunculin A, no invaginations are observed (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kukulski et al., 2012</a>). <a href=\"#bib30\">Idrissi et al. (2012)</a> however, shows that there is an initial deformation of the membrane even in the presence of Latrunculin A. An alternative model suggests that early endocytic proteins like Syp1, Ede1 and Ent1 may act as the initiators of membrane curvature. What does the recruitment of these early endocytic proteins look like in this model and how does it relate to changes in membrane shape? Is the initial deformation the result of early endocytic proteins like Syp1, Ede1 and Ent1 coupled with actin polymerization? I note that, as often pointed out by Tom Kirchhausen who has extensively studied the structure of the clathrin lattice, it is unlikely that a flat clathrin lattice may convert to a curved clathrin lattice without undergoing a complete disassembly. Thus, it would seem more likely that the initial coated patch may already be curved. I realize that a thorough analysis of the spatio-temporal localization of early endocytic factors may go beyond the goal of this study, but these considerations should be discussed."

The presentation generally ignored highly relevant work on other organisms, especially fission yeast. The new work on budding yeast offers valuable, new insights, but much of the story is remarkably similar to what was found in fission yeast. Making this clear highlights the amazing conservation of the mechanisms over the hundreds of millions of years since these two yeast diverged. These comparisons detract in no way from the authors' accomplishments. Also, the authors seem to have misunderstood several suggestions to compare the data from the two yeasts. They declined to do so, saying that this would require new experiments. However, all they needed to do was to plot the published data on the same graphs as their new data and comment on what is the same and what is different."

There are two sources of color related aberration in our set-up: the chromatic aberration and the aberration in the imaging setup used for the simultaneous acquisition of the two channels. We correct for both types of errors simultaneously. Our new simulations demonstrate that a systematic color shift between the centroid positions, does not significantly affect our trajectory alignment (See Materials and methods: Simulation of the accuracy of the two color alignment procedure; <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure1\u2013figure supplement 4</a>). Interestingly, a systematic color shift between mCherry and GFP does not affect the relative positions of the average trajectories after the alignment, only the uncertainty in their position (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 4</a>). The reason is that the endocytic events in cells are oriented randomly within the field of view and thus the centroid positions of the mCherry and GFP fluorophores are shifted relatively to each other differently in each endocytic event. When we average the contribution of the different trajectories together, the color shift averages out without significantly affecting the estimate of the relative position between the two fluorophores (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 4A, B</a>). However, larger color shift between the trajectory pairs, leads to larger uncertainty in the relative positions of the proteins (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 4C, D</a>)."

Were the tracks of Abp1-mCherry and of the GFP-proteins aligned independently of each other?

The trajectories obtained by simultaneous acquisition of two proteins give lower precision of protein dynamics, but are however sufficient to align together the average trajectories obtained by the imaging of individual proteins.

In this connection, several studies carried out on mammalian cells have demonstrated the occurrence of actin tails propelling newly formed endocytic vesicles. While tails were first described at sites of non-clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Merriefield and Almers, PMID: 10559868), a recent eLife paper demonstrated that also clathrin coated vesicles nucleate actin tails when the dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 is impaired (Nandez et al., PMID: 25107275). Thus, while the present study proves what had been implicit in previous studies, i.e. that actin nucleation occurs at the base of the invagination, could some actin eventually nucleate also from the newly formed vesicle (for example at the site of the scar left by the fission)?
