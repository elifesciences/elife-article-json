Some of the microbes that live on (or in) animals are beneficial to their host. However, these microbes' more sinister brethren, parasites and pathogens, cause damage and disease. Between these two extremes is a class of organisms that, it seems, do not harm or benefit their hosts: instead, these organisms reap their reward when the host animal dies of other causes. This lifestyle is termed \u2018necromeny\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Sudhaus and Schulte, 1989</a>) and has been considered an evolutionary intermediate to full-blown parasitism (<a href=\"#bib7\">Sudhaus, 2008</a>)."

This necromenic nematode lives inside the beetle and waits for the beetle to die, so that it can feed off the bacteria that grow on the decomposing carcass. Working with colleagues from two Max Planck Institutes\u2014the MPI for Biology of Ageing and the MPI for Developmental Biology\u2014the CalState researchers have identified a new molecular player in detection of chemical signals. They have also revealed the dual nature of the chemical cue that lures these nematodes to the beetles and, at the same time, arrests their development (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cinkornpumin et al., 2014</a>)."

First discovered as a beetle sex pheromone, this chemical was subsequently identified as an odour that attracts <i>P. pacificus</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Herrmann et al., 2007</a>). The screen identified worms with mutations in a gene called <i>obi-1</i>. This gene encodes a protein from a family of proteins that are released by diverse nematode species and bind to fatty molecules (lipids). Cinkornpumin, Wisidagama et al. speculate that the OBI-1 protein might function as a part of an extracellular clearance mechanism for lipid odorants. Such a mechanism might be required to detect small changes in odorant concentration and navigate towards the source of the pheromone."

Such multi-part odorant receptors are important for the detection of chemicals by bacteria and are also used by insects to detect some odours (<a href=\"#bib8\">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Kirby, 2009</a>). Cinkornpumin, Wisidagama et al. suggest that it is possible that OBI-1 is part of a similar mechanism in the nematode."

Furthermore, uncovering factors that help to guide specific nematodes to their hosts could lead the way to new solutions to a pressing problem. Many nematodes are parasites that cause billions of dollars of damage to agricultural crops every year and levy an even more devastating toll on human health, especially in developing countries. Parasitic nematodes rely on following chemical cues to find their hosts (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chaisson and Hallem, 2012</a>). As such, a deeper understanding of this process will offer new opportunities to develop strategies that control or eradicate populations of nematode pests."

What was the ancestral function of ZTDO? Was it first used as a chemical defence against nematodes and subsequently adapted for use as a pheromone? And, if so, does this suggest that the interactions between the ancestors of <i>P. pacificus</i> and their beetle hosts were less benign than the interactions we observe today? These new insights into the mechanisms used by <i>P. pacificus</i> to find hosts suggest that necromeny might not be a way-station on the road to parasitism but might rather be a d\u00e9tente (or compromise) reached in the evolutionary struggle between a parasite and its host."
