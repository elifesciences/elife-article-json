Here we show that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> eIF4A and Ded1p directly interact with each other and simultaneously with the scaffolding protein eIF4G. We delineate a comprehensive thermodynamic framework for the interactions between Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4G, RNA and ATP, which indicates that eIF4A, with and without eIF4G, acts as modulator for activity and substrate preferences of Ded1p, which is the RNA remodeling unit in all complexes. Our results reveal and characterize an unexpected interdependence between the two RNA helicases and eIF4G, and suggest that Ded1p is an integral part of eIF4F, the complex comprising eIF4G, eIF4A, and eIF4E."
