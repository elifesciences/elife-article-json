Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that treatment of immune competent mice bearing orthotopic breast tumors with anti-mouse CD47 antibodies resulted in short-term anemia compared to controls, consistent with the previously described function of CD47 in normal phagocytosis of aging red blood cells and results reported in the original study (Table S4; Willingham et al., 2012). The weight of tumors after 30 days administration of anti-CD47 antibodies or IgG isotype control were not found to be statistically different, whereas the original study reported inhibition of tumor growth with anti-CD47 treatment (Figure 6A,B; Willingham et al., 2012). However, our efforts to replicate this experiment were confounded because spontaneous regression of tumors occurred in several of the mice. Additionally, the excised tumors were scored for inflammatory cell infiltrates. We found IgG and anti-CD47 treated tumors resulted in minimal to moderate lymphocytic infiltrate, while the original study observed sparse lymphocytic infiltrate in IgG-treated tumors and increased inflammatory cell infiltrates in anti-CD47 treated tumors (Figure 6C; Willingham et al., 2012). Furthermore, we observed neutrophilic infiltration was slightly increased in anti-CD47 treated tumors compared to IgG control. Finally, we report a meta-analysis of the result."

For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chroscinski et al., 2015</a>) for a paper by Willingham et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications."

Using a syngeneic breast cancer model, mouse anti-CD47 antibody treatment resulted in a statistically significant decrease in final tumor weight compared to IgG isotype control (<a href=\"#bib39\">Willingham et al., 2012</a>). Anti-CD47 treatment also increased lymphocytic infiltration to the tumor site without unacceptable toxicity except short-term anemia observed immediately after dosing."

Since that publication there have been additional studies examining the safety and efficacy of targeting CD47 as an anti-cancer therapeutic. Anti-CD47 treatment was reported to increase macrophage phagocytosis, decrease tumor weight, and inhibit spontaneous metastasis in a osteosarcoma xenograft model (<a href=\"#bib40\">Xu et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, CD47 blockade was reported to enhance tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophages, reduce tumor burden, and increase survival in glioblastoma (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>), gastric cancer (<a href=\"#bib41\">Yoshida et al., 2015</a>), and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (<a href=\"#bib21\">Krampitz et al., 2016</a>) xenograft models. Cioffi and colleagues tested the effect of inhibiting CD47 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and reported that while anti-CD47 antibodies increased phagocytosis <i>in vitro</i>, it did not result in a statistically significant change in tumor growth in a PDAC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model unless administered in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cioffi et al., 2015</a>). Additionally, a humanized anti-CD47 antibody was tested for safety and efficacy in disease models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and was reported to decrease tumor burden and increase survival in an AML PDX model (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). A pre-clinical toxicokinetic study in non-human primates reported no adverse effects associated with the humanized antibody (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2015</a>) and patients with AML and solid tumors are being recruited for phase one clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02678338 and NCT02216409)."

MT1A2 mouse breast cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Addison et al., 1995</a>) were engrafted into the mammary fat pad of syngeneic FVB mice and monitored until palpable tumors formed. Mice with palpable tumors were randomized to receive injections of either 400 \u00b5g mouse IgG isotype control (IgG) or 400 \u00b5g anti-mouse CD47 (anti-CD47) antibodies every other day into the mammary fat pad proximal to the tumor.

In the original study, BALB/c mice were analyzed for blood toxicity 5 days after two 500 \u00b5g antibody injections (Table S4) and C57BL/6 mice were analyzed for specific hematology parameters 1, 3, and 6 days after a single intraperitoneal injection of 250 \u00b5g of IgG or anti-CD47 antibodies (Supplemental Figure 6) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Willingham et al., 2012</a>). Similar to what was reported for C57BL/6 mice in the original paper, FVB mice treated with anti-CD47 resulted in short-term anemia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Tumors treated with IgG grew to an average of 0.075 grams [n\u00a0=\u00a07, <i>SD</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.078], while tumors treated with anti-CD47 resulted in an average weight of 0.163 grams [n\u00a0=\u00a06, <i>SD</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.096]. The comparison of these two groups was not statistically significant (Welch's <i>t</i>-test; <i>t</i>(9.66)\u00a0=\u00a01.796, <i>p</i>=0.104). This is in comparison to the original study, which reported an average weight of 0.144 grams [n\u00a0=\u00a05, <i>SD</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.052] for IgG treated tumors and an average of 0.012 grams [n\u00a0=\u00a05, <i>SD</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.002] in anti-CD47 treated tumors. The range of observed tumor weights in the original study varied from 9 to 198 mg, with IgG treated tumors representing the higher observed weights (60\u2013198 mg) while anti-CD47 treated tumors were reported between 9 and 14 mg. This compares to this replication attempt which observed tumor weights ranging from 5 to 257 mg, with IgG treated tumors (5\u2013203 mg) and anti-CD47 treated tumors (41\u2013257 mg) having fairly similar wide distributions. Indeed, the relative standard deviation (RSD) associated with this replication attempt (IgG treated\u00a0=104%; anti-CD47 treated\u00a0=59%) was larger than the RSD reported in the original study (IgG treated\u00a0=36%; anti-CD47 treated\u00a0=18%). The RSD of the IgG treated tumors reported in <a href=\"#bib39\">Willingham et al. (2012)</a> is similar to the estimated RSDs (~30%) in the control conditions from two other published studies that utilized MT1A2 cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahn and Brown, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Noblitt et al., 2005</a>), granted these studies injected more cells and in different sites than the original study and this replication attempt. Interestingly, a more recent paper briefly stated that they purposefully did not utilize the MT1A2 cell line in their study because of a high prevalence of spontaneous tumor regression, confounding the results (<a href=\"#bib9\">Desilva et al., 2012</a>). An evaluation of tumor growth revealed this also occurred in this replication attempt with three tumors regressing at the end of the study compared to the last tumor volume measurement taken 14 days after the start of treatment (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While these observations confound the results of this replication attempt, we further explored the tumor weight data by conducting the same analysis above, but with the three tumors that regressed during the course of the study removed.

These include variables such as cell line genetic drift (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hughes et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kleensang et al., 2016</a>), circadian biological responses to therapy (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fu and Kettner, 2013</a>), mouse strain stocks (<a href=\"#bib6\">Clayton and Collins, 2014</a>), housing temperature in mouse facilities (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kokolus et al., 2013</a>), and the obesity and microbiome of recipient mice (<a href=\"#bib19\">Klevorn and Teague, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Macpherson and McCoy, 2015</a>).

Mice were ranked according to tumor volume from highest to lowest and the 14 animals with the largest tumors were assigned to a group using an alternating serpentine method.

Data were checked to ensure assumptions of statistical tests were met. The hematological parameters were analyzed by multiple one-way ANOVAs; one for each of the 15 parameters analyzed. The Bonferroni correction, to account for multiple testings, was applied to the alpha error or the <i>p</i>-value. The Bonferroni corrected value was determined by divided the uncorrected value by the number of tests performed. For the alpha error this resulted in. 0033 (.05/15). A meta-analysis of a common original and replication effect size was performed with a random effects model and the <i>metafor</i> R package (<a href=\"#bib37\">Viechtbauer, 2010</a>) (available at <a href=\"https://osf.io/ha2bx/\">https://osf.io/ha2bx/</a>). The original study data was shared by the original authors <i>a priori</i> during preparation of the experimental design. The data was published in the Registered Report (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chroscinski et al., 2015</a>) and was used in the power calculations to determine the sample size for this study."

For the second attempt, which is reported here, the number of animals to inoculate with MT1A2 cells was increased to 20, based on the observed rate of engraftment in the first attempt. This attempt resulted in 17 animals with detectable tumors at the time of randomization, with the 14 animals having the largest tumors assigned to IgG or anti-CD47 treatment. The remaining 6 animals were used to generate baseline readings for hematological analysis with one of these animals developing a tumor before the blood analysis was performed, which means that 18 of the 20 mice inoculated developed tumors."

Plainly stated, a robust preclinical study wields an ability to yield a reasonable and interpretable result in the face of experimental variability that may be endogenously or exogenously introduced. The results proffered by Errington et al. lend strong credence to the notion that they are not operating with a robust experimental system, thereby leaving me to doubt their results. Specifically, there is tremendous variability in their tumor engraftment, as evinced by their first (and failed) attempt to engraft, followed by their second endeavor in which out of 20 mice, a mere 14 were usable for the study. Moreover, Errington et al. report inconsistent growth kinetics among the 14 mice that were engrafted with the same amount of cells. The fact that Errington et al. seemed to have so much trouble setting up the experiment leads me to question the results emanating from such a study. Simply put, Errington et al.'s study is neither robust due to the extreme variability in their starting points nor reproducible (as they themselves admit), and should not be taken as hardline contrarian evidence against the study by Willingham et al."

This is an inconsistency. The tumors evaluated were very small. At the time of evaluation of the tumors, 30 days after the treatments began, approximately half of the tumors had weights between 10 and 60 mg, three of the tumors in the control group appeared to be only 10 mg or less in weight. This would correspond to tumors that were only about 2\u00d72\u00d73 mm. With tumors this small I wonder what accuracy of measurement and precision of surgery can be achieved? The methods state that 50,000 cells were injected orthotopically and that the treatment experiment would begin when the tumors were palpable. According to the protocol, the trial was terminated at 30 days. If the tumors were this small after 30 days, how big were the tumors at day 0, at the time of initial palpation? If they were on the order of the same size at that seen 30 days later, this suggests that the tumors grew little in the model, confounding the results; this would be true even in the case of the largest tumors that were observed at one month. This also seems in contrast to the rapid growth of the 50,000 cells injected to reach a \"palpable tumor \"over the 7-10 days expected, as stated in the Chroscinski registered report that describes the experiments to be done. (This is about a 100x increase in 7-10 days). In addition, there is considerable variability in tumor growth in both groups ranging from five-fold to 20-fold, respectively, between the smallest and the largest tumors. In order to better evaluate these data it would be important to know caliper sizes of all of the tumors at time 0 and any other tumor size measurements that were conducted in the 30 days before the animals were sacrificed. This would allow a better understanding of the growth kinetics and conclusions. Should these issues be discussed in the paper?"

It is not clear why there is a discrepancy in these 2 sites of the paper; or did 2 attempts fail?

Interestingly, one paper (Desilva et al., 2012) briefly stated why they purposefully did not utilize this model in their study:"

It is not clear why there is a discrepancy in these 2 sites of the paper; or did 2 attempts fail?

While the authors of this replication study found that anti-CD47 antibody treatment induced anemia and moderate infiltration of tumors by neutrophils, it had no effect to inhibit tumor growth. Treated tumors on average were actually larger than IgG-treated controls, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The findings of this study are convincing and unfortunately do not support the major finding from the previous report that treatment with this anti-CD47 antibody induces tumor regression. The key reagents used in this study were well controlled \u2013 the cells, for example, were obtained from the author of the original study.
