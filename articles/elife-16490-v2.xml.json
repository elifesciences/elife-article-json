For ill-defined reasons, CS degenerate in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and in the transitional zone (TZ) of atrophic zones (AZ), which characterize geographic atrophy (GA). Our experiments confirm the loss of cone segments (CS) in the TZ of patients with GA and show their association with subretinal CD14<sup>+</sup>mononuclear phagocyte (MP) infiltration that is also reported in RP. Using human and mouse MPs in vitro and inflammation-prone <i>Cx3cr1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup> </i>mice in vivo, we demonstrate that MP-derived IL-1\u03b2 leads to severe CS degeneration. Our results strongly suggest that subretinal MP accumulation participates in the observed pathological photoreceptor changes in these diseases. Inhibiting subretinal MP accumulation or Il-1\u03b2 might protect the CS and help preserve high acuity daytime vision in conditions characterized by subretinal inflammation, such as AMD and RP."

For ill-defined reasons, CS degenerate in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and in the transitional zone (TZ) of atrophic zones (AZ), which characterize geographic atrophy (GA). Our experiments confirm the loss of cone segments (CS) in the TZ of patients with GA and show their association with subretinal CD14<sup>+</sup>mononuclear phagocyte (MP) infiltration that is also reported in RP. Using human and mouse MPs in vitro and inflammation-prone <i>Cx3cr1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup> </i>mice in vivo, we demonstrate that MP-derived IL-1\u03b2 leads to severe CS degeneration. Our results strongly suggest that subretinal MP accumulation participates in the observed pathological photoreceptor changes in these diseases. Inhibiting subretinal MP accumulation or Il-1\u03b2 might protect the CS and help preserve high acuity daytime vision in conditions characterized by subretinal inflammation, such as AMD and RP."

Photo-transduction in cone segments (CS) are crucial for cone function and therefore high acuity and daytime vision. In geographic atrophy (GA), a late form of age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), an extending atrophic zone (AZ) forms, characterized by the loss of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE, a monolayer of cells with important functions in photoreceptor homeostasis) and degeneration of the photoreceptor cell layer (<a href=\"#bib27\">Sarks, 1976</a>). The initial lesion in GA often develops parafoveally (<a href=\"#bib28\">Sarks et al., 1988</a>) and slowly expands through the central retina and fovea, which leads to a severe drop in visual acuity. In the AZ, despite the absence of the RPE, residual cones survive, but they lack the cone segments (CS) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bird et al., 2014</a>). Similar findings are observed in disciform subretinal scars, the end-stage of exudative AMD (<a href=\"#bib8\">Curcio, 2001</a>). Surprisingly, in a transitional zone (TZ), just peripheral to the RPE-loss in the scar and AZ, the number of rods drops dramatically compared to the retina more distant from the lesion (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bird et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Curcio, 2001</a>). In contrast, the number of cones changes little in the TZ, but they lack their CS (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bird et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Curcio, 2001</a>). One could assume that the CS loss in the TZ of AMD patients is due to RPE dysfunction, but CS loss is also observed in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients with rod-gene mutations and unremarkable RPE (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mitamura et al., 2013</a>)."

We have recently demonstrated that numerous blood-derived MPs (CCR2-positive) invariably participate in the infiltration of both, the AZ and TZ (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sennlaub et al., 2013</a>). In mice, the recruitment of blood-derived monocytes contributes importantly to autoimmune, photo-oxidative, and genetic photoreceptor degeneration (<a href=\"#bib26\">Rutar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Suzuki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kohno et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cruz-Guilloty, 2013</a>) and we demonstrated that bone-marrow derived murine monocytes induce rod apoptosis in vivo and in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib30\">Sennlaub et al., 2013</a>), which is in part mediated by IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hu et al., 2015</a>).

They reported that rod loss and cone outer segment degeneration occur peripheral to the margin of the RPE defect, in the transitional zone (TZ) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bird et al., 2014</a>). In this report, we analyzed the rod and cone populations in and around 10 atrophic zones (AZ) of 9 GA donor patients and in 6 control, non GA donor eyes using immunohistochemical techniques on paraffin sections with specific primary antibodies for rhodopsin, L/M-cone opsin, and cone arrestin, which allows identifying rod or cone photoreceptors even if they lost their outer segments. In the central region of control eyes, cone arrestin (green staining) -rhodopsin (red staining) double labeling visualized a 4 to 6 nuclei thick ONL, with cone segments (CS) and dendrites clearly demarcated by the cone arrestin immunological staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, Hoechst blue staining of nuclei, RPE autofluorescence orange). The rod outer segments (OS) are strongly immunologically positive for rhodopsin staining, while the rod cell bodies stained more faintly, but enough to identify rod cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> inset). The retina distant (&gt;1000\u00a0\u03bcm) from the RPE lesion in sections from donor eyes with GA was very similar to the control eyes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), featuring clearly marked cone arrestin<sup>+</sup> CS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> inset). In the TZ, close to the margin of the lesion but where RPE was still present, the ONL was irregular, thinned (around 2 nuclei of ONL), and cone and rod morphology was severely altered with the outer segments missing and the inner segments difficult to distinguish from the cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The thinning and loss of segments was invariably found to extend peripherally to the margin of the RPE loss, into the TZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, the autofluorescent RPE is visible in the left part of the micrograph, the arrow depicts the margin of the RPE with the atrophic zone to the right). The TZ, characterized by a thinned ONL in the presence of underlying RPE, was of variable length (200\u2013800\u00a0\u03bcm) in our samples similar to previous reports (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bird et al., 2014</a>). Within the AZ residual cone arrestin<sup>+</sup> cones, but also rhodopsin<sup>+</sup> rods were observed in all but one analyzed samples, but their distribution was irregular and all photoreceptors lacked their OS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). L/M-cone opsin immunohistochemistry, which recognizes the opsins of the most abundant red and green cones, confirmed the CS loss in the TZ and AZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a> insets). Next, we quantified cone arrestin<sup>+</sup>cones (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) and rhodopsin<sup>+</sup> rods (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) in the central retina of control eyes and eyes with GA lesions. The cone density at a greater than 1000\u00a0\u03bcm distance from the RPE-denuded AZ, was similar between control and GA eyes. In the atrophic zone the number of cone somata was significantly reduced to around half the numbers of controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) and was not significantly different in the TZ (0\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcm from the AZ, which is the TZ length invariably found in all donor eyes). Rod cell counts, on the other hand, revealed a slight decrease distant from the lesions, but a severe 90% reduction in the TZ compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Interestingly, in all but one atrophic zone we also detected rhodopsin<sup>+</sup> residual rods."

We demonstrated that blood-born classical CD18<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup>Mos take part in the infiltrate at these three locations (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sennlaub et al., 2013</a>). Circulating classical Mos also express high levels of CD14 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Geissmann et al., 2003</a>), which is additionally expressed by other members of the MP family (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gautier et al., 2012</a>) and is therefore not discriminative for infiltrating Mos versus resident MPs (unlike CCR2). We analyzed the presence of subretinal CD14<sup>+</sup>MPs and cone segment morphology on central RPE/choroid and retinal flat-mounts from 4 age-matched control donor eyes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>) and 5 donor eyes with central GA lesions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013H</a>), with particular attention to the TZ. Flat-mount immunohistochemistry facilitates the appreciation of cone outer segments and the detection of the smaller, dispersed MPs that are more difficult to detect on sections. We used CD14 immunohistochemistry to visualize MPs, peanut agglutinin (PNA) that stains inner and outer CS (but not cone cell bodies) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blanks and Johnson, 1984</a>), and cone arrestin that stains cones irrespective of the presence of CS (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Central (1.5\u00a0cm around the fovea/center) retina/RPE/choroid complexes were dissected from the donor eyes and sectioned by radial incisions into 8 triangular pieces that each contain a parafoveal part in the case of control eyes and a central AZ, TZ, and non-atrophic more peripheral part for GA donor eyes. In GA tissues, the retinas of the AZ were carefully peeled from the RPE/choroid, as they adhere to Bruchs membrane in the area of RPE defects. This is not the case in the TZ, where the retina detaches easily from the underlying RPE, comparable to control retinas."

To analyze an eventual effect of human MPs on photoreceptors, we first co-cultured 100 000 human blood-derived CD14<sup>+</sup>Mos (hMo) adhering to polycarbonate filters floating on DMEM with C57BL/6 mouse retinal explants for 18\u2009hr (with the photoreceptors facing the adherent Mos). Apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining of the retinal explants cultured without Mos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), or with Mos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). TUNEL<sup>+</sup> nuclei in the photoreceptor cell layer of retinal explants were more numerous in the presence of Mos. Double-immunological labeling for rhodopsin and TUNEL on sections prepared from the retinal explants revealed that the TUNEL<sup>+</sup> nuclei of the ONL were positive for rhodopsin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> inset) and not located at proximity to the inner segments, where cone nuclei are located (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Apoptosis was only observed in a minority of rods in these short-term co-cultures and rhodopsin<sup>+</sup>rod segments were unremarkable in the culture condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Quantification of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> nuclei/mm on 8 explants per group revealed a significant increase in TUNEL<sup>+</sup> photoreceptors in co-culture with hMos compared to retinal explants cultured without hMos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) similar to co-cultures using Cx3cr1-deficient BMMs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sennlaub et al., 2013</a>). Next, we analyzed the cone population of PNA (green fluorescence) cone arrestin (red fluorescence) double-labeled mouse retinal explants after 18\u2009hr of mono-culture (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), or co-culture with hMos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Quantification of cone arrestin<sup>+</sup>PNA<sup>+</sup> cones (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>) revealed no influence of the presence of hMos on the number of cones after 18\u2009hr of culture. However, the PNA-staining in hMo-exposed retinal flat-mounts appeared punctuated and the typical elongated shape of mouse PNA<sup>+</sup>CS staining in retinas cultured without Mos had disappeared (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a>). Oblique and perpendicular 3D reconstruction views of confocal microscopy Z-stacks of explant mono-cultures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), or co-culture with hMos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>) reveals the near complete loss of PNA<sup>+</sup>CS in the hMo exposed explants. Similarly, arrestin staining revealed a severe shortening of arrestin<sup>+</sup>CS in the co-culture condition compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H and I</a> insets). Quantification of PNA<sup>+</sup> volume (quantitated on the whole Z-stack, divided by the number of cones) in retinal explants co-cultured with increasing numbers of hMo confirms numerically a severe, significant reduction in PNA<sup>+</sup>CS volume as a function of hMos numbers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). To evaluate eventual artifacts due to interspecies incompatibilities we next quantified PNA<sup>+</sup>CS volumes of mouse retinal explants that we co-cultured for 18\u00a0hr with 100 000 Cx3cr1-deficient-mouse BMMs (which induces rod apoptosis similar to hMos [<a href=\"#bib30\">Sennlaub et al., 2013</a>]). Our results revealed a similar, severe reduction in CS volume (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). Furthermore, orthogonal 3D reconstruction views of confocal microscopy Z-stacks of PNA(red)/arrestin(green)-stained explants prepared from the para-central area of a non-human primate cultured without (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a>), or with 100 000 hMos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3M</a>) reveals a similar near complete loss of PNA<sup>+</sup>CS in the hMo exposed primate explants (Quantification <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3N</a>). Again, the arrestin staining revealed a similar severe shortening of arrestin<sup>+</sup>CS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L and M</a> insets)."

Alternatively, the rapid CS reduction in the co-culture system might be due to the production of a secreted factor, such as inflammatory cytokines. We have previously shown that Cx3cr1-deficient mouse BMM induce rod apoptosis in the Mo/retinal explant co-cultures via IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hu et al., 2015</a>). We showed that Cx3cr1-deficient BMMs constitutively secrete adenosine triphosphate (ATP), express increased surface P2RX7 receptor and secrete mature IL-1\u03b2 after transcriptional stimulation without a second exogenous stimulus (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hu et al., 2015</a>), that is classically required for inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 maturation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</a>). Similarly, human blood monocytes constitutively release endogenous ATP, which leads to mature IL-1\u03b2 after transcriptional induction without a second exogenous stimulus (<a href=\"#bib21\">Netea et al., 2009</a>). RT-PCRs of mRNA prepared from freshly isolated hMo, hMo cultured alone or with a retinal explant for 18\u2009hr (both on polycarbonate filters) revealed that IL-1\u03b2 mRNA, but not IL18 mRNA, was significantly induced in hMos in the co-culture condition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), contrary to IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 that were not induced (data not shown). PNA-staining of retinal explants cultured for 18\u2009hr in the absence of Mos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) but with recombinant IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), showed that IL-1\u03b2 was sufficient to severely reduce PNA<sup>+</sup>CS. Quantification of PNA<sup>+</sup>CS confirmed the significant, IL-1\u03b2-induced volume loss (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In these experiments IL-1\u03b2 was used at a concentration of 50\u00a0ng/ml (in the range of concentration classically used in vitro) but the local IL-1\u03b2 concentration that cones are exposed to in the co-culture is difficult to estimate, as a gradient of IL-1\u03b2 is expected to form around the IL-1\u03b2 producing Mos. To directly evaluate the effect of locally produced IL-1\u03b2 we studied the effect of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) on the co-cultures. PNA-stained flatmounts of Mo/retinal co-cultures without (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) or in the presence of IL-1Ra (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) shows that IL-1\u03b2-inhibition significantly protects against Mo-induced CS loss (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>)."

Gupta et al. proposed several years ago that the subretinal inflammation secondary to rod degeneration in RP could be the 'missing link' to explain secondary CS and cone degeneration observed in RP (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gupta et al., 2003</a>). CS maintenance in RP has recently been shown to depend on cone glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis (<a href=\"#bib1\">A\u00eft-Ali et al., 2015</a>) that is stimulated by insulin (<a href=\"#bib24\">Punzo et al., 2009</a>) and rod-derived cone viability factor (<a href=\"#bib1\">A\u00eft-Ali et al., 2015</a>). Inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, inhibit insulin-dependent glucose uptake and are increasingly recognized to play an important role in insulin-resistance in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Shoelson, 2006</a>).

Total RNA was extracted from fresh monocytes and monocytes cultured for 18\u2009hr on polycarbonate filters floating on DMEM with or without an overlaying retinal explant using the Nucleospin RNA XS (740902, Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and converted to cDNA using oligo (dT) as primer and Superscript II (Life Technologies). Each RT assay was performed in a 20\u00a0\u00b5L reaction. Subsequent RT-PCR was performed using cDNA, Sybr Green PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies) and the following sense and antisense primers: <i>IL-1\u03b2</i> (5\u2019-CAT GGA ATC CGT GTC TTC CT-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-GAG CTG TCT GCT CAT TCA CG-3\u2019), <i>IL-18</i> (5\u2019-GAC CAA GGA AAT CGG CCT C-3' and 5\u2019-GCC ATA CCT CTA GGC TGG CT-3\u2019) or <i>RPS26</i> (5\u2019-AAG TTT GTC ATT CGG ATT AAC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-AGC TCT GAA TCG TGG TG-3\u2019) (0.5 pmol/\u00b5L). Real-time PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems StepOne real-time PCR systems (Applied Biosystems) with the following profile: 10\u2009min at 95\u00b0C, followed by a total of 40 two-temperature cycles (15 sec at 95\u00b0C and 1\u2009min at 60\u00b0C). To verify the purity of the products, a melting curve was produced after each run according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Immunolabeling of post mortem eyes shows loss of cone segments in the TZ and association with subretinal D14+monocyte infiltration. Using human blood-derived CD14+monocytes in vitro and inflammation-prone <i>Cx3cr1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></i>mice in vivo, evidence is presented that monocyte derived IL-1\u03b2 causes cone segment degeneration. Inhibiting subretinal monocyte accumulation or Il-1\u03b2 might protect the cone segments and help preserve or restore high acuity vision in AMD."

This work is of great clinical significance since AMD is the leading cause of blindness in older adults, at least in the developed world, and RP is the leading inherited form of blindness. What is new in this paper is the demonstration that the loss of cone photoreceptor inner and outer segments in the transition zone coincides with the infiltration of CD14+ monocytes in donor eyes from patients with advanced dry AMD. Looking for a mechanism, they turned to retinal explants from Cx3cr1 mutant mice and showed that CD14+ monocytes led to rod cell death (TUNEL positive nuclei) and degradation of cone outer and inner segments. They went on to show that this damage may be caused by the release of IL-1beta from the monocytes."

Thus, the authors should demonstrate that IL18 does not change. 2) a dose response effect of IL1b would be interesting to determine any threshold effect, especially since 50 ng/ml is strikingly supraphysiologic.

The degeneration might be a result of dysfunctional RPE prior to its degeneration, suggested by the observation of hyperfluorescence of the TZ. [\u2026] The observation that CS degeneration is also observed in RP patients with rod-gene mutations and unremarkable RPE further argues that a RPE-independent factor might participate in the degeneration.\u201d"
