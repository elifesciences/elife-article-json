It is often assumed that this arises solely from the feed-forward encoding of the strength or precision of sensory inputs. In contrast, interoceptive inference models suggest that confidence reflects a weighted integration of sensory precision and expectations about internal states, such as arousal. Here we test this hypothesis using a novel psychophysical paradigm, in which unseen disgust-cues induced unexpected, unconscious arousal just before participants discriminated motion signals of variable precision. Across measures of perceptual bias, uncertainty, and physiological arousal we found that arousing disgust cues modulated the encoding of sensory noise. Furthermore, the degree to which trial-by-trial pupil fluctuations encoded this nonlinear interaction correlated with trial level confidence. Our results suggest that unexpected arousal regulates perceptual precision, such that subjective confidence reflects the integration of both external sensory and internal, embodied states."

It is often assumed that this arises solely from the feed-forward encoding of the strength or precision of sensory inputs. In contrast, interoceptive inference models suggest that confidence reflects a weighted integration of sensory precision and expectations about internal states, such as arousal. Here we test this hypothesis using a novel psychophysical paradigm, in which unseen disgust-cues induced unexpected, unconscious arousal just before participants discriminated motion signals of variable precision. Across measures of perceptual bias, uncertainty, and physiological arousal we found that arousing disgust cues modulated the encoding of sensory noise. Furthermore, the degree to which trial-by-trial pupil fluctuations encoded this nonlinear interaction correlated with trial level confidence. Our results suggest that unexpected arousal regulates perceptual precision, such that subjective confidence reflects the integration of both external sensory and internal, embodied states."

According to this idea, the information on which we base our decisions is also the information that determines how confident we are that those decisions are correct. However, recent experiments suggest that this is not the whole story. Instead, our internal states \u2013 specifically how our heart is beating and how alert we are \u2013 may influence our confidence in our decisions without affecting the decisions themselves."

As the task became objectively more difficult, the volunteers became less confident about their decisions. However, increasing the volunteers\u2019 alertness or \u201carousal\u201d levels immediately before a trial countered this effect, showing that task difficulty is not the only factor that determines confidence. Measures of arousal \u2013 specifically heart rate and pupil dilation \u2013 were also related to how confident the volunteers felt on each trial. These results suggest that unconscious processes might exert a subtle influence on our conscious, reflective decisions, independently of the accuracy of the decisions themselves."

It is therefore crucial to understand what underlies this feeling; for example, does only the quality of available sensory signals matter, or do our confidence reports also reflect internal bodily states, such as arousal? Although confidence is thought to depend upon the quality or strength of sensory evidence, convergent computational\u00a0theory and experimental data highlight the role of interoceptive inferences in guiding exteroceptive awareness. In this sense, confidence may be a metacognitive integration of both internal and external sources of uncertainty. Here, we address this possibility using a novel psychophysical design, in conjunction with signal theoretic modelling of confidence, to assess the degree to which sensory uncertainty depends upon unexpected arousal."

Confidence is thus determined solely by the quality or strength of sensory inputs relative to a late-stage criterion or threshold. For example, in signal detection theory, sensory samples whose average intensity fall beyond a confidence criterion are ascribed a higher certainty (<a href=\"#bib27\">Galvin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lau and Rosenthal, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Maniscalco and Lau, 2012</a>). Similarly, ballistic accumulation models suggest that confidence relates to the speed of evidence accumulation relative to decision threshold (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kiani et al., 2014</a>). In both cases, confidence is generated by the bottom-up read-out of sensory information relative to a decision variable, and is assumed to depend on the same information underlying the accuracy of the perceptual decision itself."

Similarly, increased sensory noise reduces confidence even when difficulty is equated (<a href=\"#bib63\">Spence et al., 2016</a>). A potential physiological mediator of these effects is bodily arousal, which regulates affective salience and perceptual variability (<a href=\"#bib13\">Critchley et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Murphy et al., 2014b</a>). Sudden increases in arousal trigger a reciprocal cascade of central, autonomic, and peripheral responses in the brain, heart, and pupil. Centrally, arousal is mediated by a reciprocal noradrenergic network with projections throughout the prefrontal, sensory, and limbic cortices (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Murphy et al., 2014a</a>). This network of areas is also important for integrating perceptual and interoceptive signals (<a href=\"#bib61\">Singer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Critchley and Harrison, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Salomon et al., 2016</a>), error-awareness (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fiehler et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Klein et al., 2013</a>), and expected confidence or volatility (<a href=\"#bib37\">Iglesias et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schwartenbeck et al., 2015</a>)."

In contrast, predictive coding emphasizes interoceptive inference, in which confidence reflects the precision (or inverse variance) of a higher-order belief about both internal states and external sensations (<a href=\"#bib25\">Friston and Kiebel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Clark, 2015</a>). Neurobiologically, precision is encoded by the gain of local pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bastos et al., 2012</a>), which is regulated across the cortical hierarchy by neuromodulators such as dopamine and noradrenaline (<a href=\"#bib19\">Feldman and Friston, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Friston et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Moran et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kanai et al., 2015</a>). The global regulation of precision by neuromodulatory gain control entails that unexpected changes in internal states should influence the estimation of confidence for other, exteroceptive channels. Predictive coding thus hypothesizes that the weight given to sensory noise depends upon expected interoceptive states, such as arousal and cardiac acceleration (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Seth, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barrett and Simmons, 2015</a>)."

To test this hypothesis, we presented effectively salient, masked disgust cues in advance of a visual stimulus of variable sensory precision. Crucially, performance was equated across conditions such that changes in subjective uncertainty could be attributed to a precision-weighting mechanism, independently from any effect on choice accuracy. We further modelled evoked physiological responses (heart rate and pupil dilation), to determine whether the encoding of sensory noise in these measures also depended upon cue-induced \u2018arousal prediction error\u2019 (APE), and if this encoding was reflected in the\u00a0trial-by-trial fluctuations of subjective confidence."

To conclusively determine how the interaction of arousal prediction and expected precision shapes confidence, future work should explicitly manipulate the volatility of interoceptive fluctuations by altering the underlying probability of an arousal change point (<a href=\"#bib5\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Summerfield et al., 2011</a>). Additionally, although here we manipulate arousal and observe correlated changes in cardiac signals and confidence, the causal link to interoception must be established in future investigations, in which cardiac signals are directly manipulated independently of the central\u00a0nervous\u00a0system. This approach, coupled with hierarchical psycho-physiological computational modelling (<a href=\"#bib15\">de Berker et al., 2016</a>), could further reveal the interoceptive computations underlying perceptual confidence."

Across perceptual, physiological, and subjective measures we demonstrate that the encoding of sensory noise is weighted by interoceptive arousal. These results may have important implications for understanding medical and psychiatric disorders, in which patients exhibit chronic alterations in arousal or interoception. Substance abuse, psychosis, anxiety, and depression for example have been linked to altered heart-rate variability, physiological responses, and interoceptive sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dawson et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hoehn-Saric and McLeod, 2000</a>).

Neutral face identity was pseudo-randomly selected from the stimulus pool to ensure that face identity always changed from cue to mask. A forward mask was created by phase-scrambling all stimulus faces. Each trial began with the presentation of a phase-scrambled face (250 ms duration), followed by a single cue frame (~16.667 ms), and a neutral-face mask (100 ms). Immediately following the neutral face a stationary dot display appeared (250 ms) prior to motion onset (250 ms), followed by another stationary isoluminant dot-mask, which participants viewed while making their perceptual choice (800 ms) and confidence rating (2500 ms). At the end of the perceptual choice interval, a sliding scale marked at four equal intervals by vertical lines appeared, centered within the dot mask. To limit eye movements, the width of the rating scale was restricted to one half the dot-mask radius. All stimuli were presented behind a central fixation dot. Finally, after the rating interval the scale vanished and participants centrally fixated on the dot mask for a 2\u20133 s randomly jittered ITI.

Participant head position was held constant throughout the experiment using a headrest positioned 62 cm from the screen. ECG signals were measured using disposable Ag/AgCl bipolar surface electrodes (100 Foam, Covidien) affixed just below the left and right clavicle and a ground electrode affixed to the nape of the neck using medical tape and Spectra 360 salt-free electrode gel (Parker Laboratories). Prior to electrode placement each contact site was thoroughly cleaned using an alcohol swab. ECG signals were amplified using an Asalab System (ANT Neuro Recording) and recorded via Visor2 2.0 software at a 1024 Hz sampling rate. Changes in pupil diameter were monitored using an Eyelink 1000 eye tracker (SR research) recording at 1000 Hz sampling rate, and synchronized to the stimulus PC using the Eyelink Toolbox, for PsychToolbox (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002881\">SCR_002881</a>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cornelissen et al., 2002</a>).

The type-II measures M-Ratio (MR), and M-Bias (MB,\u00a0or\u00a0Meta-Criterion), which characterize metacognitive sensitivity and bias (i.e., uncertainty) respectively, were thus calculated using maximum likelihood estimation implemented in freely available MATLAB (Mathworks Inc, version R2014a) code separately for each condition (<a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~bsm2105/type2sdt/\">http://www.columbia.edu/~bsm2105/type2sdt/</a>).

Data for each condition were epoched according to the onset of the forward mask from \u2212500 ms baseline to 4166 ms (rating offset), before applying automatic blink detection and linear interpolation, blink rejection, linear de-trending, low pass-filtering, and a combination of manual and automatic artefact rejection. Blinks were detected as any sample in which amplitude dropped below 600 arbitrary units dilation and were linearly interpolated, such that if any trial began or ended with a blink the interpolation was based on the first reliable sample. Any trial where more than 25% of samples were marked as blinks were rejected from the\u00a0analysis. All trials were then linearly detrended and low-pass filtered at a 30 Hz cut-off, manually inspected for artefacts and passed through a final automatic artefact detection, searching for the\u00a0unreliable pupil lock based upon the absolute maximum of the trial\u2019s first derivative, with any trial beyond 3 SD rejected. These procedures resulted in a mean rejection rate of 19.30% (SD\u00a0=\u00a09.33) of trials across participants.
