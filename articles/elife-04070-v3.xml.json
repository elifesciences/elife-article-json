Just as animals develop from a single cell\u2013the zygote\u2013multicellular rosettes of <i>S. rosetta</i> develop from a founding cell. To investigate rosette development, we established forward genetics in <i>S. rosetta</i>. We find that the rosette defect of one mutant, named Rosetteless, maps to a predicted C-type lectin, a class of signaling and adhesion genes required for the development and innate immunity in animals. Rosetteless protein is essential for rosette development and forms an extracellular layer that coats and connects the basal poles of each cell in rosettes. This study provides the first link between genotype and phenotype in choanoflagellates and raises the possibility that a protein with C-type lectin-like domains regulated development in the last common ancestor of choanoflagellates and animals."

Just as animals develop from a single cell\u2013the zygote\u2013multicellular rosettes of <i>S. rosetta</i> develop from a founding cell. To investigate rosette development, we established forward genetics in <i>S. rosetta</i>. We find that the rosette defect of one mutant, named Rosetteless, maps to a predicted C-type lectin, a class of signaling and adhesion genes required for the development and innate immunity in animals. Rosetteless protein is essential for rosette development and forms an extracellular layer that coats and connects the basal poles of each cell in rosettes. This study provides the first link between genotype and phenotype in choanoflagellates and raises the possibility that a protein with C-type lectin-like domains regulated development in the last common ancestor of choanoflagellates and animals."

The evolution of the animal molecular toolkit may be reconstructed through the study of the choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of animals (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Carr et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ruiz-Trillo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Philippe et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Paps et al., 2012</a>). For example, despite the fact that choanoflagellates are not animals, they express diverse genes required for animal multicellularity, including C-type lectins, cadherins, and tyrosine kinases (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abedin and King, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">King et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Manning et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nichols et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Suga et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fairclough et al., 2013</a>), demonstrating that these genes predate the origin of animals. In addition, the architecture of choanoflagellate cells is conserved with animals and helps to illuminate the ancestry of animal cell biology (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nielsen, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Richter and King, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alegado and King, 2014</a>)."

Through a process that resembles the earliest stages of embryogenesis in marine invertebrates, single cells of <i>S. rosetta</i> undergo serial rounds of cell division to develop into spherical rosette colonies (hereafter, \u2018rosettes\u2019; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fairclough et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dayel et al., 2011</a>). Rosette development in choanoflagellates mirrors the transition to multicellularity that is hypothesized to have preceded the origin of animals (<a href=\"#bib21\">Haeckel, 1874</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nielsen, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mikhailov et al., 2009</a>), although its relationship to animal development is unknown. Recent improvements to the phylogeny of choanoflagellates reveal that colony development may have an ancient origin that extends to the first choanoflagellates and possibly to the last common ancestor of choanoflagellates and animals (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nitsche et al., 2011</a>). The possibility that choanoflagellate colony development and animal embryogenesis have a common evolutionary history is brought into greater relief when compared with the quite different process of development observed in outgroups of the animal + choanoflagellate clade (e.g., <i>Capsaspora owczarzaki;</i> <a href=\"#bib55\">Sebe-Pedros et al., 2013</a>), in which isolated cells with different genotypes gather into aggregates."

Importantly, the switch between the <i>S. rosetta</i> solitary life style and rosette development is regulated by specific lipids produced by the prey bacterium <i>Algoriphagus machipongonensis</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alegado et al., 2012</a>). Thus, rosette development can be induced in the laboratory. Moreover, the genome and transcriptome of <i>S. rosetta</i> have been sequenced and analyzed, revealing numerous homologs of diverse animal genes, many of which are up-regulated in colonies (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fairclough et al., 2013</a>). However, the roles of animal gene homologs in choanoflagellates have not been determined, and there have not been any published reports of successful disruptions to choanoflagellate gene function (including gene deletions, RNA interference, or transgene expression). Indeed, no direct functional links have yet been drawn between genotype and phenotype for any choanoflagellate gene or trait. We recently found that <i>S. rosetta</i> can be induced to undergo sex and meiosis, suggesting that it may be amenable to mapping crosses (<a href=\"#bib32\">Levin and King, 2013</a>). Therefore, to determine the genetic basis of rosette development and investigate its relationship to animal development, we set out to establish forward genetics in <i>S. rosetta</i>."

Rosettes and chain colonies can be easily distinguished from each other. In addition to the differences in their morphology, the connections among cells in rosettes are robust and resistant to mechanical shear, whereas chain colonies are fragile and readily fall apart into individual cells when exposed to shear forces. Nonetheless, chain colonies and rosettes have some similarities, including the presence of fine intercellular bridges connecting neighboring cells and similar transcriptional profiles (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dayel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fairclough et al., 2013</a>).

We thus inferred that the gene(s) disrupted in the Rosetteless mutant might have roles specific to rosette development. Therefore, as we set out to establish methods for mapping mutations in <i>S. rosetta</i>, we focused on the Rosetteless mutant. We started by sequencing Rosetteless and two closely related wild-type strains (the parental strain from which Rosetteless was isolated and C2E5, a co-isolated wild-type strain) to identify sequence variants that could serve as genetic markers (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), with the understanding that one or more of the detected sequence variants might ultimately prove to be the causative mutation(s). After filtering the sequence variants by quality, we identified 25,160 potential genetic markers that differed between Rosetteless and the reference genome sequence, only four of which were unique to the Rosetteless genome (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To this end, Rosetteless was mated with another, previously sequenced <i>S. rosetta</i> strain, Isolate B (<a href=\"#bib32\">Levin and King, 2013</a>), that carried 39,451 putative sequence polymorphisms relative to Rosetteless (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Nonetheless, because the CTLDs of Rtls have not yet been shown to bind sugar moieties, we follow the convention of the field and provisionally refer to Rtls as a C-type lectin-like protein. Rtls also contains several low-complexity regions that each consists of as many as 50\u201360 consecutive threonines and serines and two high-complexity internal repeat regions (RP1 and RP2) of unknown function near the C-terminus of the protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>).

However, when using primers that could amplify either the wild-type isoform or variant splice isoforms (a 5\u2032 primer bridging the exon 5/6 junction paired with a 3\u2032 primer in exon 12), we found that <i>rtls</i> was spliced as predicted in wild-type cells, but produced multiple, variant splice isoforms in Rosetteless cells.

Importantly, the wild-type <i>rtls</i> isoform was not detected in Rosetteless cells using this assay.

In wild-type cells, Rtls was highly enriched in the extracellular matrix-filled center of rosettes, where it was observed in a thick layer underlying the basal poles of all cells in the rosette (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). While Rtls staining sometimes connected all cells in the center of rosettes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), in most instances Rtls was observed to connect all but one pair of neighboring cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Because rosettes form through a process of incomplete cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fairclough et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dayel et al., 2011</a>), this discontinuous Rtls staining may reflect the history of cell division during rosette formation, with discontinuities in its distribution indicating adjacent cells that were not sisters. We hypothesize that Rtls regulates rosette development by interacting with components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which has previously been shown to fill the center of rosettes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dayel et al., 2011</a>)."

Because Rtls has a predicted secretion signal, it is possible that <i>S. rosetta</i> chain colonies and single cells released Rtls into their aquatic environment, where it may have been washed away during processing of cells for immunofluorescence. After increasing the gain used during confocal imaging, we were able to detect Rtls in cell membrane-associated patches in wild-type single cells and chains, but these patches were absent from Rosetteless mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The molecular mechanisms by which Rtls regulates rosette formation remain unknown, but the developmentally regulated secretion of Rtls protein into the ECM-filled space in the center of rosettes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) likely provides some important clues. Rtls may stabilize the connections between rosette cells by interacting with the ECM in a manner akin to the lecticans, a family of animal C-type lectins that stabilize cartilage and other connective tissues by cross-linking carbohydrates and proteins in the ECM (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ruoslahti, 1996</a>). Such a role would be consistent with the observation that the Rosetteless mutant produces wild-type chain colonies, as one of the main differences between rosettes and chain colonies lies in the stability and mechanical robustness of rosettes as compared to chain colonies. A second possible hint regarding Rtls function stems from the fact that the Rtls CTLDs most closely resemble animal CTLDs that preferentially bind mannose (<a href=\"#bib17\">Drickamer, 1992</a>), such as mannose binding protein and pulmonary surfactant protein A, each of which functions in innate immunity as pattern recognition receptors (<a href=\"#bib58\">Takahashi et al., 2006</a>). Because rosette development is regulated by bacterial signals (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alegado et al., 2012</a>), Rtls may play a role in substrate recognition and cell signaling. Future work on the biochemical and physiological roles of Rtls will enable the discovery of other proteins in the rosette development regulatory pathway, while also potentially providing insights into the ancestral functions of CTLD-containing proteins."

However, the molecular functions of Rtls are currently unknown and it is therefore unclear whether they are conserved in animal CTLD-containing proteins. Moreover, while the genomes of diverse animals encode Rtls-like proteins containing a signal peptide, two C-type lectin-like domains, and serine-threonine-rich low complexity regions (e.g., the placozoan <i>Trichoplax adhaerans</i> (XP_002112548), the cnidarian <i>Hydra vulgaris</i> (XP_002155329), the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (NP_501369.1), and the fish <i>Danio rerio</i> (XP_005158004); relevant motifs detected by SMART, [<a href=\"#bib31\">Letunic et al., 2012</a>]), it is not clear whether the similarities among these proteins and Rtls are the result of homology or convergent evolution (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although it is not straightforward to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among <i>S. rosetta</i> and animal CTLD-proteins, the future analysis of additional rosette defect mutants promises to illuminate the remaining rosette regulatory pathway and reveal whether this pathway is conserved in the regulation of animal multicellularity."

We experimentally validated all of the predicted Rosetteless-specific SNVs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Short regions of genomic DNA flanking SNVs predicted to be unique to Rosetteless were amplified by PCR using a 1:1 mix of Taq (New England Biosciences, Ipswich, MA) and Pfu (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), gel extracted using the GeneClean II kit (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), and analyzed by Sanger sequencing. SNVs were considered \u2018verified\u2019 if they were present in Rosetteless gDNA but absent from gDNA from the parental strain. The supercontig 8 splice donor mutation (<i>rtls</i><sup><i>l1</i></sup>) was the only Rosetteless-specific SNV predicted to alter a coding region, and we confirmed that this mutation was present in Rosetteless and absent from the parental strain by PCR and Sanger sequencing (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In contrast, when we attempted to verify the other 16 detected Rosetteless SNVs, only three were verified as polymorphic between Rosetteless and the parental strain. Of the remaining variants, three were false-positive variant calls in Rosetteless, two lay within regions of the reference genome that were misassembled, and eight were false-negative variant calls, where shared, segregating polymorphisms were not identified in the parental strain or the C2E5 wild-type strain. Thus despite the fact that the vast majority of called SNVs were high quality and independently called in all three samples, the enrichment of poor SNV calls in the Rosetteless-specific set meant that of the 17 potentially unique SNVs originally identified in the Rosetteless genome, there remained only four verified SNVs, including a predicted splice donor mutation at supercontig 8: position 427,804."

The Rosetteless phenotype and splice donor mutation were present in 82% of the isolated progeny (145/177), while the remaining progeny readily formed rosette colonies, (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

As chain colonies break up into many individual cells, it may be more likely that chain-forming cells will be selected during the clonal isolation process as compared to cells in rosettes.

Primary antibody signal was detected using an IR-dye-conjugated secondary antibody (Licor Biosciences anti-rabbit 800 nm 1:10,000) and the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). To test the specificity of anti-Rtls to Rtls protein on dot blot, the primary antibody was pre-incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of purified epitope at room temperature for 1 hr before application of the primary antibody to the membrane. Images were analyzed in ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>) as follows: a box of constant area was placed over each dot to measure the integrated density of the area. The integrated density value for the secondary only control was subtracted from each sample to eliminate the signal due to mild autofluorescence of the membrane, and then each sample was normalized to the wild-type dot. Only dots processed on the same membrane were normalized in this manner."

Thus, we outline here proposed guidelines for naming choanoflagellate genes. Any genes with clear homology to named genes in other organisms should be referred to by the pre-existing name (e.g., <i>hsp90</i>). Any genes without clear homology to named genes should be given names that allude to the gene's function or the phenotype of the first mutant allele isolated. Before mutant genes are cloned, each mutant is given its own name, but renaming may be necessary once the causative mutation is identified. Gene names should be written in lower case and in italics. Specific mutations should be named with one letter for the last name of the first author of the publication describing the allele and one number for the order of allele isolated. Mutations are presented as an italicized superscript (e.g., <i>rtls</i><sup><i>l1</i></sup>). Mutant names and protein names are written in upper case and non-italics. Since many three-letter abbreviations have already been used for genes in other organisms, we propose the use of four-letter abbreviations."

This organism develops from a single cell form into a multi-cellular form (rosettes) in response to environmental cues from its prey bacterium. The authors recently discovered and now take advantage of an extant sexual cycle to conduct chemical and X-ray mutagenesis. Nine mutants were uncovered through painstaking ocular inspection. One, Rosetteless, was characterized in detail here. The authors took multiple approaches to define and characterize the causative mutation, including genetic linkage analysis, whole genome sequencing, and characterization of the impact of the mutation on splicing. A genetic linkage map was constructed for the first time and used to show that the mutation segregates as a single mendelian trait on supercontig 8. The authors show that the mutation alters splicing of a putative C-type lectin, and make the case that this predicted cell surface protein is the root of the genetic defect. These studies represent a tour de force development and application of genetics to a powerful pre-metazoan model system."

Although knowledge of the homology or Rtls to metazoan protein is not absolutely necessary and will probably not change the current conclusions, the relative importance of the finding reported (the mutant <i>rtls</i>) changes depending on whether Rtls is homologous or not to animal CTLD-containing proteins. Thus, if Rtls happens to be homologous to animal C-type lectins, then this will be a clear example of co-option (of adhesion proteins/domains) taken place at the origin of the metazoan lineage. If it is not, the finding is mostly important to understand the specific development of choanoflagellate colonies. Either way the finding is important enough, but the wider implications change. Thus, this issue should be clarified in order for the reader to fully grasp the implications of the findings here reported. One option is to perform phylogenetic trees to see whether Rtls (or the Rtls CTLDs) is/are homologous to metazoan C-type lectin containing genes. If trees are not possible, maybe the authors could try blast similarity network analyses. At a minimum, the authors should consider expanding the discussion to include: 1) whether <i>S. rosetta</i> or other choanoflagellates have other types of C-type lectins, 2) whether Rtls is also present in the non-colonial choanoflagellate <i>M. brevicollis</i> (from which genome is available), 3) whether CTLDs are specific to animals and choanoflagellates or are they present in other more ancient eukaryotes."

To summarize the main text, Rtls mutants are missing both the bright staining at the center of rosettes (because the mutants do not produce rosettes) and the fainter, cell-membrane associated patches found in wild type single cells and chains. By dot blot, the anti-Rtls signal was reduced in mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1C</a>) even though the antibody should recognize both wild type and truncated Rtls isoforms.

If the Rosetteless antibody is pre-incubated with recombinant Rosetteless protein, the first two staining patterns (i.e. extracellular meshwork in center of rosettes and thin membrane-associated patches) disappear, presumably because those patterns result from antibody binding that specifically recognizes Rosetteless protein. The third pattern (i.e. faint staining throughout the cell body) persists following pre-incubation of the Rosetteless; we interpret this third pattern then to reflect either autofluorescence or non-specific staining. We are careful in the text to delineate that portion of the staining pattern that is specific to Rosetteless vs. that which reflects either autofluorescence or non-specific staining (in the legend for <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 2</a>): \u201cIn all cells following competition with the epitope there remained faint staining in the cell body; we thus infer that this is non-specific staining that does not reflect the distribution of Rtls protein in the cells\u201d)."

We believe that the explanation for this phenomenon lies in the predicted mucin-like domains of the Rtls protein; in similar S/T-rich regions, mucins are heavily glycosylated, making these proteins sticky and quite large [Harrop et al, 2011]. Indeed, because such ECM proteins may be decorated with a variable number of sugars and often undergo other forms of posttranslational processing (e.g. cleavage into active forms), a single band on a Western may not even be expected for this type of protein."

Therefore, because Western analysis of Rosetteless in <i>S. rosetta</i> cell lysates has not yet been possible, we used dot blot analysis to measure the relative abundance of Rosetteless protein in wild type and mutant cells [Harrop et al, 2011, Thomsson et al 2011]. As the reviewers pointed out, dot blots are not ideal, as the high concentration of protein can lead to non-specific binding of antibodies and, because the proteins are not separated by size, it is not possible to see whether the source of the signal is from one protein or multiple proteins. Nonetheless, for proteins that do not properly enter into gels, it can provide a means by which to estimate their abundance. Similar to our procedure for validating the antibody by immunofluorescence, we used the pre-incubation of the recombinant epitope with anti-Rtls antibody to compete away the staining that specifically recognized the Rosetteless protein. In <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>, we demonstrate that this pre-incubation results in the loss of the majority, but not all, of the signal by dot blot. We also showed the residual signal following competition in the main figure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), and explained in the figure legend for this panel that it was only a \u201csemi-quantitative\u201d method, thereby acknowledging the limitations with dot blots."

We refrain from making this assertion because it is not currently possible to clearly assess the homology between Rtls and animal lectins. Specifically, the divergence time between animals and choanoflagellates means that orthology assignments often must be made on the basis of domain architecture and organization instead of amino acid alignments. This analysis cannot be convincingly carried out for Rtls, as its simple domain architecture is not sufficiently diagnostic. Finally, within animals, C-type lectins are a family of rapidly evolving genes that exhibit extensive duplications and rearrangements among taxa (e.g. [Sattler et al, 2012; Drickamer et al 1999]). It is thus not currently possible to assign clear orthology relationships among many of the animal C-type lectins, much less between animal C-type lectins and more evolutionarily distant CTLD-containing proteins found in choanoflagellates and other eukaryotes (e.g. [Wheeler et al, 2008]). We discuss the limitations in identifying homologous C-type lectins in the legend for <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 2</a>."
