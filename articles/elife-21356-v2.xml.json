Here we show that the Widom 601 nucleosome positioning sequence can produce hexasomes in a specific orientation on DNA, providing a useful tool for interrogating chromatin enzymes and allowing for the generation of nucleosomes with precisely defined asymmetry. Using this methodology, we demonstrate that the Chd1 chromatin remodeler from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> requires H2A/H2B on the entry side for sliding, and thus, unlike the back-and-forth sliding observed for nucleosomes, Chd1 shifts hexasomes unidirectionally. Chd1 takes part in chromatin reorganization surrounding transcribing RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and using asymmetric nucleosomes we show that ubiquitin-conjugated H2B on the entry side stimulates nucleosome sliding by Chd1. We speculate that biased nucleosome and hexasome sliding due to asymmetry contributes to the packing of arrays observed in vivo."

Here we show that the Widom 601 nucleosome positioning sequence can produce hexasomes in a specific orientation on DNA, providing a useful tool for interrogating chromatin enzymes and allowing for the generation of nucleosomes with precisely defined asymmetry. Using this methodology, we demonstrate that the Chd1 chromatin remodeler from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> requires H2A/H2B on the entry side for sliding, and thus, unlike the back-and-forth sliding observed for nucleosomes, Chd1 shifts hexasomes unidirectionally. Chd1 takes part in chromatin reorganization surrounding transcribing RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and using asymmetric nucleosomes we show that ubiquitin-conjugated H2B on the entry side stimulates nucleosome sliding by Chd1. We speculate that biased nucleosome and hexasome sliding due to asymmetry contributes to the packing of arrays observed in vivo."

A fundamental characteristic of the histone code is the combinatorial diversity achieved from multiple marks, which may or may not reside on the same histone tail (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tee and Reinberg, 2014</a>). Both through post-translational modifications (PTMs) and substitution of histone variants, additional chemical diversity arises from asymmetric modifications of nucleosomes. Since the nucleosome is pseudo-symmetric with two copies of each core histone (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4), asymmetry occurs when each copy possesses distinct epigenetic modifications. Recent advances have revealed asymmetry at the single nucleosome level (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rhee et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Voigt et al., 2012</a>), yet with challenges in synthesizing uniform populations of asymmetrically modified nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lechner et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Liokatis et al., 2016</a>), the biological significance of the vast majority of asymmetric marks remains unclear."

Trimethylation of H3K27 is carried out by PRC2, and while H3K4me3 blocks modification of K27 on the same H3 tail, PRC2 can deposit a H3K27me3 mark on the opposing H3 tail of the same nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lechner et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Voigt et al., 2012</a>). In addition to generating nucleosomes with asymmetric H3K4me3/H3K27me3, PRC2 is also activated by the mark it deposits, with substrate preference for asymmetric nucleosomes containing one H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lechner et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Margueron et al., 2009</a>). While recognition of asymmetric H3K27me3 is believed to be important for maintenance and spreading of heterochromatin, and the bivalent H3K4me3/H3K27me3 signature has been well established for stem cell identity, there is relatively little biological understanding for most other epigenetic marks that are prominently asymmetric. Genome-wide studies have revealed that the\u00a0+1 nucleosome is strikingly asymmetric with regards to H3K9 acetylation, H2B ubiquitination, and residency of H2A.Z (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rhee et al., 2014</a>). Asymmetric marks of the\u00a0+1 nucleosome correlate with asymmetric localization of the RSC, INO80, and SWR1 chromatin remodelers (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ramachandran et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yen et al., 2012</a>), and a major question is how these and other enzymes generate and read-out the asymmetric distribution of these marks."

Although specific binding of H3K4me3 by the chromodomains of mouse Chd1 has been correlated with its localization to the promoter (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lin et al., 2011</a>), Chd1 and ISWI remodelers have been shown to participate in resetting the chromatin barrier in coding regions after passage of Pol II, required for preventing cryptic transcription (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheung et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pointner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Radman-Livaja et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Smolle et al., 2012</a>).

To aid passage of Pol II, the machinery that travels along with the transcription bubble alters local chromatin structure, yet it is not known how changes to nucleosomes might influence Chd1 or other chromatin remodelers. In addition to potentially generating hexasomes, passage of Pol II is also coupled to transient ubiquitination of H2B (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fleming et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Xiao et al., 2005</a>). Interestingly, the H2B-Ubiquitin (H2B-Ub) mark is required for FACT-assisted disruption of the chromatin barrier (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pavri et al., 2006</a>). Chd1 has been shown to be required for high levels of transcription-coupled ubiquitination of H2B in vivo (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2012</a>), yet a direct connection between Chd1 and transcriptionally altered nucleosomes has remained elusive."

Curiously, during the course of nucleosome reconstitutions by salt dialysis, we noticed that native PAGE migration of a smaller species changed depending on the location of flanking DNA. We use the strong Widom 601 positioning sequence (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lowary and Widom, 1998</a>), with the X-601-Y naming convention, where X and Y refer to the number of base pairs flanking the core 145 bp 601 sequence.

With one H2A/H2B dimer missing, hexasomes have\u00a0~40 bp of DNA unwrapped from the core, resulting in DNA lifting off the histone core prematurely at superhelical location 3 (SHL3), three helical turns from the nucleosome dyad, on the side lacking the H2A/H2B dimer. For end-positioned 601 constructs, where nucleosomes lack flanking DNA on one side, hexasomes would be expected to migrate differently depending on whether unwrapping occurred on the side with or without flanking DNA. We reasoned that the differences in hexasome migration may therefore be due to a systematic loss of H2A/H2B from one side of the Widom 601 sequence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To test this idea, we probed the accessibility of DNA using Exonuclease III (ExoIII) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). On nucleosomes, ExoIII digestion showed the expected protection at the edge of the histone core, with preferential cleavage in\u00a0~10\u201311 nt increments (lanes 2\u20134 and 14\u201316). The 80-601-0 hexasome, in contrast, was digested more internally by\u00a0~30\u201340 nt on the 0 bp side, while showing full nucleosome protection on the 80 bp side (lanes 6\u20138 and 18\u201320). Relative to the orientation of the 601 sequence, the 0-601-80 hexasome showed an analogous pattern, with\u00a0~30\u201340 nt more extensive ExoIII digestion on the 80 bp side and similar protection on the 0 bp side compared to nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, the preferred location of the remaining H2A/H2B dimer in the hexasome was not influenced by flanking DNA, but instead was determined in a sequence-specific fashion based on the orientation of the Widom 601."

Single-molecule DNA unzipping experiments demonstrated that one side of the 601 forms more stable contacts with histones (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hall et al., 2009</a>), and the asymmetry of the 601 was found to form a polar barrier to passage of RNA polymerase II (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bondarenko et al., 2006</a>). One feature that has been pointed out as a key determinant of stable histone-DNA contacts are periodic TA dinucleotide steps (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lowary and Widom, 1998</a>). The Widom 601 is notably asymmetric in TA steps on either side of the dyad where binding affinity is expected to be highest, with four TA steps on one side opposite a single TA step on the other side (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chua et al., 2012</a>). Symmetric derivatives of 601 have shown that the TA-rich side is much more salt stable than the TA-poor side (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chua et al., 2012</a>), and single molecule experiments have found that the TA-poor side preferentially unwraps under force (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ngo et al., 2015</a>). We orient the Widom 601 with the TA-rich side on the left, which means that the side lacking the H2A/H2B dimer in hexasomes corresponds with the TA-poor side of the 601 sequence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

With this technique, labeling a single cysteine variant of H2B (S53C) with photo-reactive 4-azidophenacyl bromide (APB) allows for UV-induced cross-linking to nucleosomal DNA (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kassabov et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kassabov and Bartholomew, 2004</a>). Importantly, cross-linking reduces the chemical stability of the modified base, and therefore favors abasic sites that in turn result in cleavage of the DNA backbone. By separating such site-specifically cleaved fragments on a sequencing gel, the DNA base that reacted with the APB-labeled cysteine can be identified. For chromatin remodelers, changes in positioning of the cross-linked site is interpreted as a shift in the position of the histone core along DNA. In nucleosomes, each H2B cross-links to only one DNA strand, and therefore doubly-labeled fluorescent DNA is needed to report on both sides of the 601 sequence. In agreement with ExoIII experiments, H2B cross-linking for hexasomes was virtually absent on the TA-poor side of the 601, whereas cross-linking on the TA-rich side was equivalent for hexasomes and nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; compare lane 1 with 2 and 4 with 5). Strikingly, addition of H2A/H2B fully recovered the H2B cross-link on the TA-poor side (compare lanes 5 and 6), demonstrating that dimer addition generates correctly organized nucleosomes that are indistinguishable from those obtained by salt dialysis reconstitution. Similar results were obtained with 0-601-80 hexasomes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), reinforcing the conclusion that salt dialysis deposits limiting H2A/H2B on the TA-rich side of the Widom 601."

By having a defined orientation on DNA, these hexasomes offer a unique tool for probing requirements of nucleosome-interacting enzymes. Despite the two-fold pseudo-symmetry of the nucleosome, factors binding off the central dyad axis encounter the two halves of the nucleosome at distinct distances and orientations. The two H2A/H2B dimers and the DNA they coordinate are therefore likely to play unequal roles in nucleosome recognition and enzyme regulation. Chromatin remodelers such as Chd1 shift DNA past the histone core by acting at SHL2, an internal DNA site located\u00a0~20 bp from the dyad (<a href=\"#bib44\">McKnight et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Saha et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schwanbeck et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Zofall et al., 2006</a>). Relative to the SHL2 site of DNA translocation, one H2A/H2B dimer is positioned to bind DNA that\u00a0is\u00a0pulled onto the nucleosome, and is therefore considered to be on the entry side, whereas the other H2A/H2B binds DNA that\u00a0shifts off the histone core, and thus is on the exit side. In vitro, Chd1 slides mononucleosomes away from DNA ends (<a href=\"#bib44\">McKnight et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Stockdale et al., 2006</a>). By using end-positioned nucleosomes, we can restrict the direction of sliding, thereby defining H2A/H2B adjacent to the long flanking DNA as the entry-side dimer. Since the placement of the single H2A/H2B dimer relative to 601 is maintained regardless of flanking DNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we can generate hexasomes with the H2A/H2B dimer on either the entry or exit side, which allows us to determine the extent that Chd1 relies on H2A/H2B at each position."

For nucleosomes, electrophoretic\u00a0mobility decreased upon addition of Chd1 and ATP, signifying movement away from DNA ends (lanes 1\u20138).

We therefore investigated the ability of Chd1 to reposition hexasomes using histone mapping (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In agreement with previous work (<a href=\"#bib52\">Patel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Stockdale et al., 2006</a>), Chd1 shifted end-positioned mononucleosomes to more central locations on DNA, with the majority of nucleosomes repositioned\u00a0~20 to\u00a0~60 bp from their starting locations (lanes 1\u20133, 7\u201318). For hexasomes, however, the ability of Chd1 to reposition was strongly dependent on the location of the single H2A/H2B dimer. The 0-601-80 hexasomes, which lacked the entry-side H2A/H2B dimer, failed to show robust repositioning, with the majority of products remaining at the starting position (lanes 4\u20136). In marked contrast, the 80-601-0 hexasomes shifted robustly onto flanking DNA, demonstrating that Chd1 activity can be supported by an H2A/H2B dimer on only the entry side (lanes 19\u201330). Interestingly, instead of generating more centrally positioned products, Chd1 shifted 80-601-0 hexasomes to the opposite end of DNA, farther than observed for nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This biased movement of 80-601-0 toward the entry H2A/H2B dimer, even after the hexasome had shifted away from its starting position on the 601 sequence, was consistent with much poorer sliding toward the side lacking the H2A/H2B dimer and indicated that it was the absence of H2A/H2B rather than the DNA sequence that blocked efficient sliding of 0-601-80 hexasomes. Thus, Chd1 can reposition hexasomes, but the requirement for entry-side H2A/H2B yields a strong directional bias for hexasomes that contrasts with the back-and-forth sliding observed for nucleosomes."

Though many variations are possible, fluorescent dye labeling of nucleosomes commonly involves both histones and DNA, which allows for detection of DNA unwrapping and DNA translocation relative to the histone core (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blosser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Li and Widom, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Yang et al., 2006</a>). The FRET signal, however, can be complicated by the two-fold symmetry of the nucleosome, since dyes at the two related histone positions are typically not equidistant from the DNA-tethered dye, and therefore lead to a mixture of FRET levels (<a href=\"#bib10\">Deindl et al., 2013</a>). A standard solution to this issue has been to dilute the labeled histone with an excess of unlabeled histone during nucleosome reconstitution, and select out the desired FRET signal from a single donor/acceptor pair. We expected that the unique placement of a single H2A/H2B dimer relative to the DNA sequence should allow us to generate nucleosomes with a single, uniform FRET pair."

As previously described (<a href=\"#bib10\">Deindl et al., 2013</a>), the nucleosomes gave rise to two major FRET populations corresponding to single Cy3 dyes on the distal or proximal H2A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). A mid-FRET population is expected between these two major species, where nucleosomes contain Cy3 on both copies of H2A. Here, due to extensive dilution of labeled H2A-Cy3, that population was minimal. In contrast, the oriented hexasomes yielded a single, high-FRET population as expected for the H2A/H2B dimer located on the exit side, proximal to the DNA label (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To see whether these hexasomes would behave as nucleosomes upon H2A/H2B dimer addition, we incubated these samples with Chd1 and ATP to stimulate nucleosome sliding. After a 10 min incubation, all nucleosomes had shifted to a low FRET state, as expected for a\u00a0\u226520 bp shift of the histone core away from the labeled DNA end. Hexasomes, in contrast, maintained a significant population of high-FRET species after incubation, consistent with the poor movement observed by histone mapping in the absence of entry-side H2A/H2B dimer. Addition of H2A/H2B dimer to hexasomes did not significantly alter the starting high-FRET population, yet incubation with Chd1 and ATP yielded a low-FRET profile similar to that observed for nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These results show that oriented hexasomes offer a defined methodology for producing uniformly labeled nucleosomes that should benefit smFRET experiments."

In the presence of the ATP analog ADP\u2219BeF<sub>3</sub>, both lobes of the ATPase motor of Chd1 bind to DNA at SHL2, which can be monitored by APB labeling of the Chd1 variants N459C (lobe 1) and V721C (lobe 2) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nodelman et al., 2017</a>).

Strikingly, the same cross-linking pattern was also observed with 40-601-40 hexasomes (lanes 3, 6, 9 and 12), indicating that this ATP-bound state of the ATPase motor was not hindered by the lack of H2A/H2B on one side.

Using the same labeling positions described above for FRET, we found that quenching can be achieved using either a donor (Cy3B) and quencher (Dabcyl) pair, or two cyanine dyes (Cy3-Cy3). As with FRET, movement of exit DNA away from the histone core separates donor-quencher pair and results in increased donor fluorescence. Since quenching requires direct contact, SQOF likely provides higher sensitivity than FRET at shorter distances. With Dabcyl as a quencher on exit DNA, we monitored fluorescence of 0-601-80 hexasomes containing a single H2A-Cy3B label in the absence and presence of an additional, unlabeled H2A/H2B dimer. Reactions were performed with saturating (1 mM) ATP and excess Chd1 (600 nM) relative to hexasome (10 nM) to reduce the likelihood that defects in sliding might be attributed to binding. Under these conditions, Chd1 shifted the hexasome much more rapidly when excess H2A/H2B was added to generate nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Both reactions were fit to double exponentials, with hexasome alone dominated by a slower rate of 0.0017 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, whereas hexasome plus H2A/H2B dimer yielded a dominant,\u00a0&gt;300 fold faster rate of 0.57 s<sup>\u22121</sup>. The hexasome reactions also yielded a ~three-fold lower change in fluorescence intensity compared to nucleosomes, consistent with an inability to shift all hexasomes away from the DNA end under equilibrium conditions and indicating that even the slow hexasome rate is likely an overestimate. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the ability of Chd1 to shift hexasomes lacking the entry side H2A/H2B dimer is extremely poor."

As expected, these two substrates yielded similar progress curves, though hexasome plus dimer was slightly faster. This difference arose from a modest (~15%) decrease in the fast rate (0.49 s<sup>\u22121</sup> vs 0.57 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) and a larger contribution of the slow rate to the fits (11% vs 1%) for salt dialyzed nucleosome compared with hexasome plus H2A/H2B dimer. Previous kinetic analysis of nucleosome sliding by the ACF remodeler using FRET reported that a\u00a0~10 fold slower phase contributed 10% of the signal, which the authors suggested was due to a distinct population of nucleosome substrates (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yang et al., 2006</a>). This explanation matches the behavior we observed for nucleosomes here, and suggests that the faster shifting population of nucleosomes is more favored with H2A/H2B dimer addition to hexasomes. We also repeated comparison of nucleosomes versus hexasome plus dimer substrates at a lower (25 \u03bcM) ATP concentration (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Under these conditions, we found no significant difference in the fast rate of sliding, again with the slow rate contributing more to the amplitude of the progress curve for nucleosome (10%) compared to hexasome plus H2A/H2B (3%). These results suggest that adding H2A/H2B to hexasomes produces nucleosomes that are similar to and apparently more homogeneous than those produced by salt dialysis."

Since the H2A C-terminus was reported to not be required for octamer stability (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bao et al., 2004</a>), we used a truncated H2A lacking residues 110\u2013129. Interestingly, Chd1 mobilized nucleosomes containing this truncated H2A on the entry dimer 2.5-fold faster than wild type (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, green).

We introduced three combinations of amino acid substitutions of the H2A acidic patch: H2A-E64R, H2A-D90R/E92R, and H2A-E61A/E64A/D90A/E92A. In comparison to wild type H2A, each of these H2A mutations resulted in a two-fold decrease in Chd1 nucleosome sliding rates (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, brown, orange, and magenta). These modest rate decreases suggest that the H2A acidic patch is not a critical epitope required for Chd1 sliding. However, it is interesting to note that these reactions were performed with saturating Chd1 (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and therefore the reduced rate, while modest, suggests a catalytic rather than a binding defect."

We generated hexasomes from nucleosome reconstitutions in the presence of limiting H2A/H2B dimer, and our work indicates that one side of the 601 has a much higher affinity for H2A/H2B than the other, resulting in preferential salt-deposition of the dimer in a sequence-specific fashion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). While identification of sequence elements responsible for preferred H2A/H2B deposition requires further investigations, we speculate that the biased orientation of hexasomes may arise from the asymmetric distribution of inward-facing\u00a0minor groove TA steps flanking the nucleosome dyad. The Widom 601 is well known for its marked asymmetry in strength of histone-DNA contacts (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hall et al., 2009</a>), and higher salt resistance of the TA-rich side of the 601 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chua et al., 2012</a>) is consistent with the preferential H2A/H2B deposition that yields oriented hexasomes. Although primarily associated with H3/H4 on the most internal portion of nucleosomal DNA, the periodic TA steps also correlate with interactions between H2A/H2B and the adjacent segments of DNA. In force pulling experiments, the periodic TA steps were shown to influence unwrapping, with a strong preference for unwrapping the TA-poor side of the Widom 601 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ngo et al., 2015</a>). The sequence and structural properties of the DNA segment directly contacting H2A/H2B should be important for dimer affinity, and notably, one of the four TA-step positions is located at SHL3.5, a minor groove site contacted directly by H2A/H2B dimer, which is 'TA' on the TA-rich side and 'CC' on the TA-poor side (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). While DNA that directly contacts H2A/H2B likely plays a role, we believe that the stability of the adjacent H3/H4-DNA interactions, dictated by the presence or absence of periodic TA steps surrounding the dyad may be just as important in determining H2A/H2B occupancy. The strength of histone-DNA interactions also depends on the nature of the histones themselves. Here, we focused on the widely used canonical histones from <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, and it will be interesting to discover the extent that histone variants and canonical histones of other species respond to DNA sequence elements of the Widom 601 and in naturally occurring nucleosome positioning sequences."

Like other remodelers, the ATPase motor of Chd1 shifts DNA toward the dyad (<a href=\"#bib44\">McKnight et al., 2011</a>), which means that the SHL2 site where the motor acts is adjacent to the entry-side H2A/H2B dimer. We show that the entry-side dimer is critical for robust sliding by Chd1, which results in a strongly biased repositioning of hexasomes toward the side with the H2A/H2B dimer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). As shown by cross-linking, the absence of one H2A/H2B dimer does not appear to diminish binding of the Chd1 ATPase motor to either SHL2 site of the hexasome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), strongly suggesting that the defect in sliding occurs after engagement of the remodeler."

One explanation for our findings is that rather than a specific interaction with the entry side H2A/H2B dimer, Chd1 may instead be responding to DNA unwrapping. How Chd1 might sense unwrapping on the entry side is not yet clear, but loss of DNA wrapping from an H2A/H2B dimer may alter dynamics of histone-histone and the remaining histone-DNA contacts, providing a means for Chd1 to indirectly determine the state of the nucleosome prior to sliding. Sensitivity to DNA unwrapping is consistent with slower nucleosome sliding activity of Chd1 when a transcription factor is bound on the entry side of the nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nodelman et al., 2016</a>). Transcription factors compete with histone-DNA contacts and can dramatically unwrap nucleosomal DNA when their binding sites are located within the histone footprint (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li and Widom, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">North et al., 2012</a>). By slowing nucleosome sliding by Chd1, analogously to what we observe here with hexasomes, DNA unwrapping could provide a means for sensing a transcription factor at the nucleosome edge, which in turn would help avoid pulling transcription factors further onto the nucleosome. Although experiments performed here were limited to the Chd1 remodeler, we expect that the biochemically similar ISWI remodelers, which slide nucleosomes directionally away from bound transcription factors and generate evenly spaced nucleosome arrays (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lusser et al., 2005</a>), should also exhibit a strong directional bias in sliding hexasomes."

In vitro, both transcription through nucleosomes by Pol II and remodeling by RSC along with the NAP1 chaperone have been shown to generate hexasomes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kireeva et al., 2002</a>). Although histone chaperones such as FACT would be expected to replace the missing H2A/H2B dimer during transcription, the passage of Pol II has been shown to specifically displace the H2A/H2B dimer distal to the promoter (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hsieh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kulaeva et al., 2009</a>), which would orient hexasomes for biased sliding toward the 5' end. One speculative idea is that nucleosome array packing against the\u00a0+1 nucleosome, which is dependent on Chd1 and ISWI chromatin remodelers (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>), would be favored by directional hexasome sliding (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Even with relatively few or transient hexasomes, directional sliding toward the transcriptional start site would be expected to corral upstream nucleosomes, similar to the phasing of nucleosome arrays against transcription factor-targeted nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib45\">McKnight et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wiechens et al., 2016</a>). Consistent with this idea, it has been shown that inactivation of Pol II relaxes nucleosome packing in coding regions, resulting in a nucleosome drift of\u00a0~10 bp toward the 3' end of yeast genes (<a href=\"#bib73\">Weiner et al., 2010</a>)."

However, due to the pseudo two-fold symmetry of the nucleosome, labeling any of the histones with a FRET fluorophore (donor or acceptor) typically yields three different labeling configurations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Deindl et al., 2013</a>). The presence of multiple FRET pairs, each with distinct and potentially closely spaced FRET values substantially complicates such analyses and at the same time limits throughput by decreasing the population of nucleosomes with the desired labeling configuration. Here, we show how oriented hexasomes can yield a homogeneously labeled population (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) that greatly facilitates smFRET experiments."

DNA was precipitated by adding 1.5 \u03bcL of 10 mg/mL glycogen, 5 \u03bcL of 3 M sodium acetate and 250 \u03bcL 100% EtOH and then chilled at \u221280\u00b0C for\u00a0&gt;20 min followed by centrifugation (21,130 rcf) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. After a 70% EtOH wash and air drying of the pellet, samples were resuspended in 8 \u03bcL of formamide loading buffer and separated on urea sequencing gels as described for histone mapping."

Next, Chd1 was added, and after another brief equilibration, the sliding reaction was initiated with 25 \u03bcM ATP. Cy3 (or Cy3B) was excited at 510 nm and fluorescence was monitored at 565 nm using a 4 nm slit width and 1 s integration time. Stopped flow experiments were conducted on an SX20 stopped-flow (Applied Photophysics Limited) with nucleosome (or hexasome and dimer) and Chd1 in one syringe and ATP in the other. Cy3 (or Cy3B) was excited at 510 nm and emissions were monitored above 570 nm with a long-pass filter. Fluorescence signal was integrated over 0.01 s for the first ten seconds of the reaction and then 0.1 s for the remainder of the trace.

One would expect that the two histone dimers in the symmetric nucleosome would be equivalent, but the authors provide compelling evidence that the histone H2A/H2B dimers in nucleosomes reconstituted on the Widom 601 strong nucleosome positioning DNA sequence are not equivalent. In fact, the authors show that when histone tetramers, histone dimers and the Widom 601 positioning sequence are reconstituted with limiting amounts of histone dimer, the histone dimer is preferentially reconstituted on one side of the nucleosome (the TA-rich side). The authors further show that such oriented hexasomes can be converted into nucleosomes by incubation with additional histone dimer, thus providing a method for producing nucleosomes with labeled histone dimer in a specific orientation with respect to the nucleosomal DNA. Overall the manuscript includes some important observations, but is a little disjointed. The manuscript describes a new tool for chromatin biologists to perform targeted biochemical and spectroscopic experiments to shed mechanistic insights into the dynamics of the nucleosomes or how chromatin enzymes function on nucleosomes. It is difficult to assess how widely this will be used since there are a relatively small number of groups performing single molecule assays on nucleosomes. However, the ability to generate asymmetric nucleosomes may be useful in chromatin structural biology in ways that have not yet been thought of."

How does one distinguish between a requirement for H2A/H2B on the entry side versus a requirement for particular DNA sequence on the entry side when the presence of H2A/H2B on the entry side is dependent on the entry side DNA sequence? I am not sure that one can easily deconvolute the role of H2A/H2B and the role of DNA sequence. The strongest piece of evidence in favor of the authors' interpretation is the stimulation of Chd1 by ubiquitylated H2B on the entry-side dimer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). I encourage the authors to consider if they can devise experiments to analyze Chd1's requirement for H2A/H2B versus DNA sequence on the entry-side. If this is not possible in a timely manner, the authors should clearly discuss this issue in the manuscript."

This is particularly relevant given the question raised above of the potential difficulty distinguishing between the role of the entry-side H2A/H2B and the entry-side DNA sequence. One obvious possibility to discuss is the DNA sequence occupied by the H2A/H2B dimer in the oriented hexasome."

How does one distinguish between a requirement for H2A/H2B on the entry side versus a requirement for particular DNA sequence on the entry side when the presence of H2A/H2B on the entry side is dependent on the entry side DNA sequence? I am not sure that one can easily deconvolute the role of H2A/H2B and the role of DNA sequence. The strongest piece of evidence in favor of the authors' interpretation is the stimulation of Chd1 by ubiquitylated H2B on the entry-side dimer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). I encourage the authors to consider if they can devise experiments to analyze Chd1's requirement for H2A/H2B versus DNA sequence on the entry-side. If this is not possible in a timely manner, the authors should clearly discuss this issue in the manuscript.</i>"

We realized that a direct answer to this question is shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, where 80-601-0 hexasomes show a different distribution than 80-601-0 nucleosomes. Specifically, hexasomes are shifted farther to the opposite end of the DNA, which means that the histone core has moved ~75 bp from its starting position and therefore changed the sequence of DNA over the location where the missing H2A/H2B dimer would sit. The altered distribution of the hexasome toward the side with the entry side H2A/H2B dimer indicates that the histone core is not readily shifted toward the side lacking the dimer, even when the DNA sequence over the missing dimer is completely different. We therefore conclude that it is the lack of the H2A/H2B dimer and not the sequence that is responsible for the poor sliding of hexasomes with the dimer missing on the entry side. This conclusion is presented in the Results: \u201cThis biased movement of 80-601-0 toward the entry H2A/H2B dimer, even after the hexasome had shifted away from its starting position on the 601 sequence, was consistent with much poorer sliding toward the side lacking the H2A/H2B dimer and indicated that it was the absence of H2A/H2B rather than the DNA sequence that blocked efficient sliding of 0-601-80 hexasomes.\u201d"

One obvious possibility to discuss is the DNA sequence occupied by the H2A/H2B dimer in the oriented hexasome.</i>"

Previous work by the Davey group clearly showed that the TA-rich side of the 601 is much more salt tolerant than the TA-poor side. In their Chua et al. (2012, NAR) paper, the authors generated symmetric 601 sequences, with two copies of the TA-rich side (called 601L) showing significantly higher salt stability compared with 601R, made with two copies of the TA-poor side. While it may very well be the ~30 bp sequence that directly contacts H2A/H2B that is critical, we believe that the force-unwrapping paper by the Ha lab (Ngo et al., 2015, Cell) demonstrates that interactions between H3/H4 and DNA around the dyad can influence stability of adjacent H2A/H2B-DNA contacts farther (~30 bp) from the dyad. However, since one of the four TA step positions (at SHL 3.5) also contacts the H2A/H2B dimer, future experiments correlating the orientation of the hexasome with DNA sequence will be required to tease apart direct versus indirect sequence effects."
