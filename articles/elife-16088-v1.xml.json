                    "text": "Corticostriatal afferents can engage parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons to rapidly curtail the activity of striatal projection neurons (SPNs), thus shaping striatal output. Schemes of basal ganglia circuit dynamics generally consider striatal PV+ interneurons to be homogenous, despite considerable heterogeneity in both form and function. We demonstrate that the selective co-expression of another calcium-binding protein, secretagogin (Scgn), separates PV+ interneurons in rat and primate striatum into two topographically-, physiologically- and structurally-distinct cell populations. In rats, these two interneuron populations differed in their firing rates, patterns and relationships with cortical oscillations in vivo. Moreover, the axons of identified PV+/Scgn+ interneurons preferentially targeted the somata of SPNs of the so-called \u2018direct pathway\u2019, whereas PV+/Scgn- interneurons preferentially targeted \u2018indirect pathway\u2019 SPNs. These two populations of interneurons could therefore provide a substrate through which either of the striatal output pathways can be rapidly and selectively inhibited to subsequently mediate the expression of behavioral routines."

Schemes of basal ganglia circuit dynamics generally consider striatal PV+ interneurons to be homogenous, despite considerable heterogeneity in both form and function. We demonstrate that the selective co-expression of another calcium-binding protein, secretagogin (Scgn), separates PV+ interneurons in rat and primate striatum into two topographically-, physiologically- and structurally-distinct cell populations. In rats, these two interneuron populations differed in their firing rates, patterns and relationships with cortical oscillations in vivo. Moreover, the axons of identified PV+/Scgn+ interneurons preferentially targeted the somata of SPNs of the so-called \u2018direct pathway\u2019, whereas PV+/Scgn- interneurons preferentially targeted \u2018indirect pathway\u2019 SPNs. These two populations of interneurons could therefore provide a substrate through which either of the striatal output pathways can be rapidly and selectively inhibited to subsequently mediate the expression of behavioral routines."

One major type of GABAergic striatal interneuron expresses parvalbumin (PV). Striatal PV+ interneurons can form axo-somatic synapses with SPNs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Koos and Tepper, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kubota and Kawaguchi, 2000</a>), allowing them to powerfully inhibit SPNs of both the so-called \u2018direct pathway\u2019 and \u2018indirect pathway\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gittis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Planert et al., 2010</a>). These interneurons exhibit short-latency responses to powerful excitatory inputs from afferents originating in distinct cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib66\">Ramanathan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sharott et al., 2012</a>), providing a mechanism for rapidly stopping or delaying SPN spiking (<a href=\"#bib51\">Mallet et al., 2005</a>) and, in turn, modulating striatal outputs. Consistent with this, physiologically-classified (putative) PV+ interneurons in striatum, often called \u2018fast-spiking interneurons\u2019 (FSIs), appear to have a specific role in \u2018selecting\u2019 motor programs, firing most intensely at the choice execution/decision making point of a given task (<a href=\"#bib24\">Friedman et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gage et al., 2010</a>). The functional importance of striatal PV+ interneurons is further illustrated by the severe movement deficits that result from their loss or selective disruption (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burgui\u00e8re et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gittis et al., 2011</a>)."

In contrast, striatal PV+ interneurons are usually treated as a single functionally-homogenous population that is enriched within dorsolateral striatum (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gerfen et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kita et al., 1990</a>). There is some evidence, however, of anatomical, physiological and molecular heterogeneity within this population, suggesting that distinct subpopulations of PV+ interneuron could exist within the striatum. Striatal PV+ interneurons in rats can be broadly divided into two subtypes based on the sizes of their axonal and dendritic fields (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kawaguchi, 1993</a>), and the ratio of synapses formed with SPN somata and dendrites varies considerably between individual PV+ cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kubota and Kawaguchi, 2000</a>). Physiologically, identified PV+ interneurons in rats display highly variable firing rates and patterns in vivo (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sharott et al., 2012</a>). It is therefore reasonable to speculate that such variance or diversity could arise from the blinded sampling of functionally-distinct subpopulations of PV+ interneurons. Moreover, studies in mouse striatum indicate that almost half of all PV+ interneurons express serotonin receptor subunit 3A, again highlighting possible functional disparity (<a href=\"#bib56\">Munoz-Manchado et al., 2016</a>)."

In certain specialized cases, the combinatorial expression of calcium-binding proteins, together with other markers such as transcription factors and neuropeptides, has been used to disambiguate interneuron types that had been previously defined by structural features (<a href=\"#bib80\">Viney et al., 2013</a>). Combinations of similar molecules could thus be used to systematically demarcate different populations of PV+ interneurons in striatum. Secretagogin (Scgn), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein (<a href=\"#bib67\">Rogstam et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alp\u00e1r et al., 2012</a>), is a particularly promising candidate marker of striatal interneuron heterogeneity, as it is expressed by some (sparsely distributed) non-cholinergic striatal neurons (<a href=\"#bib55\">Mulder et al., 2009</a>). Using a combination of immunohistochemistry, stereological cell counting and in vivo recordings of identified interneurons, we demonstrate that Sgcn is co-expressed in a segregated and specialized population of striatal PV+ interneurons in rats and primates, but not in mice. Our findings suggest that distinct subpopulations of PV+ interneurons could enable corticostriatal afferents to orchestrate SPN activity in a topographically- and output pathway-selective manner."

All striatal Scgn+ cells co-expressed the \u2018pan-neuronal\u2019 marker NeuN, but not the SPN-specific marker Ctip2 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arlotta et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>), indicating that Scgn is exclusively expressed by interneurons.

These findings suggest that, in rats, Scgn is a candidate marker for a subtype of PV-expressing interneuron. Moreover, Scgn+ interneurons were relatively common overall, with a density that was about two thirds of that of PV+ interneurons, indicating that Scgn is itself a novel marker of a major class of striatal interneuron in the rat. We found this divergence in Scgn immunoreactivity between rodent species using two antibodies raised against different epitopes of Scgn that have 100% and 95% sequence homologies for rat and mouse, suggesting that the relative paucity of Scgn+ interneurons in mice was not a result of differences in antibody specificity (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

Thus, if a given cell population has a biased spatial distribution across striatum, it will likely receive privileged inputs from a specific subset of all striatal afferents. With this in mind, we next tested whether the two molecularly-distinct populations of PV+ interneuron, i.e. those that co-expressed Scgn (PV+/Scgn+) and those that did not (PV+/Scgn-), were preferentially localized to discrete striatal regions in the rat. The density of PV+/Scgn- interneurons remained relatively constant along the rostro-caudal axis of dorsal striatum, at least until the most caudal aspects where density decreased by around 75% (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Ai,B</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). However, PV+/Scgn+ interneurons displayed a strikingly different pattern of localization, being more sparsely distributed across most striatal levels, except in the most caudal aspects where their density was around three times higher than that of PV+/Scgn- interneurons in any other plane (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Aii,B</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). The two populations of interneurons were also differentially distributed along the medio-lateral axis of the striatum; PV+/Scgn- neurons were evenly distributed, whereas PV+/Scgn+ interneurons tended to distribute more laterally in the rostral striatum but more medially in caudal striatum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). This\u00a0particular pattern of bias in the distribution of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons is highly unusual in that it has not been described for any other striatal cell population. Along the dorso-ventral axis, PV+/Scgn- interneurons were more likely than PV+/Scgn+ interneurons to display a slight dorsal bias in their localization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>).

When all rat PV+ interneurons were grouped together for analysis, and all coronal planes were considered, there was no consistent bias in their relative positions along the dorso-ventral axis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). However, the relative medio-lateral positions of all PV+ interneurons varied along the rostral-caudal axis; they tended to be laterally positioned in those coronal planes rostral of Bregma, but medially positioned in planes caudal to Bregma (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The distribution biases of all PV+ interneurons were thus similar to those of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>), suggesting the presence of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons biases the entire PV+ interneuron population. In line with this, there was no consistent or strong bias in the relative positions of PV+/Scgn- interneurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Taken together, these data suggest that, in rat dorsal striatum, the biased medio-lateral distributions of PV+ interneurons can be largely explained by the selective expression of Scgn. To further explore this notion, we analyzed the spatial distributions of all PV+ interneurons in the mouse dorsal striatum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), which contains a tiny number of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). There was no consistent or strong bias in the relative positions of all PV+ interneurons in mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>) and, as such, their distribution pattern closely resembled that of PV+/Scgn- interneurons in rats (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), but not that of all PV+ interneurons in rats (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These observations were supported by quantitative comparisons of the differences in medio-lateral positions across coronal planes of all mouse PV+ interneurons, all rat PV+/Scgn- interneurons and all rat PV+ interneurons; the differences in the latter were significantly larger (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). The relatively uniform distribution of PV+ interneurons in mouse striatum thus tallies with their relative lack of Scgn expression. These data serve to reinforce that Scgn is a useful and highly-relevant marker for dividing PV+ interneuron populations."

This discrepancy presumably arises from differences in the cell-counting methodologies and analyses used, including the extent to which different regions of dorsal striatum were sampled; we calculated the relative position of each neuron counted in 13 coronal planes, rather than calculating cell densities according to arbitrary \u2018quadrants\u2019 in 1 coronal plane (Luk and Sadikot, 2001)."

Secretagogin was expressed by some neurons in both the caudate nucleus and putamen of monkeys; it was frequently co-expressed with PV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Compared to the rat, co-expression of PV and Scgn was more common in primates; about three quarters of PV+ interneurons in caudate nucleus and putamen also expressed Scgn (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Thus, Scgn is itself a novel marker of a major class of striatal interneuron in both monkeys and rats. Along the rostro-caudal axis of monkey striatum, but most notably in the caudate nucleus, there was a marked increase in the density of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in caudal planes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>), mirroring the biased rostro-caudal distribution of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in the rat striatum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The density of PV+/Scgn- interneurons remained relatively constant across the rostro-caudal extent of monkey striatum, which is again in line with our observations in rats (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>.). Interestingly, the distribution of PV+/Scgn- interneurons, but not PV+/Scgn+ neurons, was laterally biased throughout rostro-caudal aspect putamen, but not caudate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). When taken together, the data from monkey and rat not only show that a substantial proportion of striatal PV+ interneurons co-express Scgn, a population enriched in caudal striatum, but also that these novel constituents of the striatal microcircuit are phylogenetically conserved to some extent."

Similarly, the firing of PV+/Scgn- interneurons was more strongly locked to cortical spindle oscillations (7\u201312\u2009Hz), which was reflected in both a greater number of significantly locked neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>) and greater vector length (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, Mann Whitney, p=0.008). In contrast, the firing of PV+/Scgn+\u00a0interneurons was more tightly locked to cortical gamma (30\u201380\u2009Hz) oscillations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), and a greater proportion of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons were significantly locked to gamma oscillations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The phase-locked firing of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons was generally more similar across all cortical oscillation frequencies during the activated brain state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F,H</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). However, around three times as many PV+/Scgn+ interneurons were locked at gamma frequencies between 30 and 60\u2009Hz as compared to PV+/Scgn-\u00a0interneurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). These results indicate that the temporal organization of the firing of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons with respect to ongoing cortical oscillations is distinct and brain state-dependent, thus demonstrating further physiological divergence between these cell populations."

Fully delineating the role of any neuron type requires an understanding of not only its neurochemical/molecular properties and the temporal organization of its activity, but also of the cellular targets that it innervates. With the latter in mind, some of the recorded and neurobiotin-labeled PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- interneurons (n = 4 and 4, respectively) were used to gain insight into whether these two cell populations target the same types of SPN to the same extent. We thus compared the prevalence of appositions of the terminal-like axonal varicosities ('boutons') of neurobiotin-labeled PV+/Scgn+ or PV+/Scgn- interneurons with the cell bodies of SPNs (selectively labeled with DARPP-32). In agreement with previous descriptions (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kawaguchi, 1993</a> <a href=\"#bib69\">Sharott et al., 2012</a>), PV+ interneurons exhibited dense local axonal arborizations (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) that often formed varicosities in close proximity to (i.e. were apposed to) the somata of SPNs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Whether or not these appositions indicated the presence of functional axo-somatic synapses between PV+ interneurons and SPNs was investigated by simultaneously detecting the presence of gephyrin, which is highly enriched in the post-synaptic membranes of GABAergic synapses (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sigal et al., 2015</a>). Quantification of the overlap between gephyrin puncta and axonal varicosities revealed that appositions between neurobiotin-labeled axonal boutons and SPNs were often the sites of putative GABAergic synapses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Indeed, 69.2 \u00b1 2.4% of appositions (n = 104) made by the axons of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons (n = 3) with SPN somata were associated with discrete puncta of gephyrin immunoreactvity, while 75.5 \u00b1 6.6% of appositions (n = 94) made by the axons of PV+/Scgn- neurons (n = 2) were associated with discrete gephyrin+ puncta. These data suggest that, at the site of an apposition of a PV+ interneuron axonal bouton with a SPN soma, there is a high probability of a GABAergic synapse being formed."

                                "text": "Fundamental to the conceptual organization of basal ganglia function is the separation of SPNs into two information streams, the so-called direct and indirect pathways, which have broadly antagonistic roles in the expression of behavior (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</a>). Thus, we next examined whether there was any bias in the proportion of appositions formed between the PV+ interneuron axons and the somata of SPNs of the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Somatic co-expression of DARPP-32 and preproenkephalin (PPE) was used to identify iSPNs, whereas those SPNs that did not express PPE were considered to be dSPNs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ellender et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lee et al., 1997</a>). The axons of individual PV+/Scgn- interneurons could readily be observed to form multiple basket-like appositions around PPE+ iSPNs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), whereas the axons of PV+/Scgn+\u00a0interneurons appeared to more often target PPE- dSPNs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Quantitative analysis confirmed that these two populations of PV+ interneurons significantly differed in their preferential targeting of the somata of iSPNs and dSPNs (Fisher Exact Test, p&lt;0.0001). More specifically, the axonal boutons of PV+/Scgn- interneurons (n = 119 boutons from 4 interneurons) were more commonly apposed to iSPN somata than to dSPN somata (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,E</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1</a>). In contrast, the axons of PV+/Scgn+\u00a0interneurons (n = 238 boutons from 4 interneurons) preferentially targeted dSPN somata (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,E</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1</a>). In tissue sections containing the neurobiotin-labeled axons of PV+ interneurons, approximately half of all SPNs located within 30 \u00b5m (i.e. approximately 2 SPN cell body diameters) of an axonal bouton were iSPNs. This meant that the mean ratio of dSPNs to iSPNs in each section containing labeled interneuron axon was close to 1.0 (ratios of 1.04 \u00b1 0.07 and\u00a01.00 \u00b1 0.12 for sections containing axons of PV+/Scgn+ or PV+/Scgn- interneurons, respectively). This indicates that the preferential targeting of dSPNs and iSPNs by the axons of PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- interneurons, respectively, was not the result of a preferential distribution or enrichment of dSPNs or iSPNs in these specific tissue sections. Taken together, these results show that not only do PV+/Scgn- interneurons and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons target SPN somata to different extents, but also that these two types of interneuron preferentially innervate the somata of distinct populations of SPNs. By virtue of these biased connections, PV+/Scgn- interneurons might be better positioned than PV+/Scgn+ interneurons to selectively shape the activity of SPNs of the indirect pathway, whereas PV+/Scgn+ neurons might be better positioned to selectively influence SPNs of the direct pathway."

Indeed, PV+ interneurons can rapidly integrate synchronized cortical inputs and thence curtail or delay SPN firing (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gittis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Koos and Tepper, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mallet et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Ramanathan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sharott et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Planert et al., 2010</a>). Our analysis of neurobiotin-labeled PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons suggests these two cell types selectively innervate iSPNs and dSPNs, respectively. When our observations are placed within a framework of feedforward inhibition in vivo, one might predict that, first, the firing of PV+/Scgn- interneurons is more likely to precede the firing of iSPNs than dSPNs, and secondly, that the firing of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons is more likely to precede the firing of dSPNs than iSPNs."

A subset of recorded and neurobiotin-labelled SPNs (n = 36 of 48) were tested for their expression of PPE, which led to the identification of 18 dSPNs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Ai</a>) and 18 iSPNs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Bi</a>). A subset of PV+ interneurons (n = 15 of 26) were tested for their co-expression of Scgn, which led to the identification of 8 PV+/Scgn- and 7 PV+/Scgn+ interneurons. As a common reference point for the temporal analysis of all striatal neuron firing, we used the peak of the slow oscillation (~1\u2009Hz) present in the inverted striatal local field potential (iLFP) that was simultaneously recorded with the single-unit activity (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Aii,Bii</a>). The slow oscillation in the iLFP is of particular relevance because it is a proxy signal for the cortically-driven synchronized 'up states' of many SPNs in the vicinity of the electrode (<a href=\"#bib32\">Goto and O'Donnell, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Stern et al., 1998</a>). For each striatal neuron, we calculated histograms of the spike times and iLFP amplitudes across the iLFP peak in 100 time bins, irrespective of the length of the individual cycle (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013C</a>); this normalization procedure ensured that the variable durations of the slow oscillation components (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nakamura et al., 2014</a>) and thus, variable \u2018peak lengths\u2019, did not confound the analysis."

These observations agree with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib51\">Mallet et al., 2005</a>), and are further supported by the fact that the median firing times of the SPN and PV+ interneurons were not different (Mann Whitney, p=0.55. <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1</a>). However, when the subsets of identified dSPNs and iSPNs were separately analyzed, their firing probability profiles only partly overlapped; dSPNs tended to fire before the center of the iLFP peak whereas iSPNs fired on or slightly after the center (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Cii</a>). Accordingly the median firing time of dSPNs significantly preceded that of the iSPNs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1</a>). To give further context to this spike timing difference, we separately analyzed the firing of the identified PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons. The firing probability profiles of the two types of PV+ interneuron diverged substantially; the profile of PV+/Scgn- interneurons was sharp with a maximum well before the center of the iLFP peak, whereas the profile of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons was broad and maximal around the center (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Ciii</a>). Analysis of median firing times confirmed that PV+/Scgn- interneurons fired significantly earlier than PV+/Scgn+ interneurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1</a>), thus highlighting further disparities in the in vivo firing properties of these two types of PV+ interneuron. When the firing times of PV+/Scgn- interneurons, PV+/Scgn+ interneurons, dSPNs and iSPNs were compared (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1</a>), it was evident that PV+/Scgn- interneurons fired significantly earlier than iSPNs but not dSPNs, whereas PV+/Scgn+ interneurons did not fire before iSPNs or dSPNs (their firing was significantly delayed as compared to dSPNs). There were no significant differences in the peak times, lengths or amplitudes of the iLFP peaks between the different neuron groups (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with post-hoc Dunn tests), suggesting that the differences in firing times of the distinct neuron types were not due to systematic biases in the LFPs recorded with each population."

This result is consistent with our anatomical data showing that, in the context of targeting SPN somata, PV+/Scgn- interneurons exhibit a considerable bias towards innervating iSPNs. The firing of PV+/Scgn+ interneuron firing with respect to dSPN firing did not validate the second prediction; the spike timings of this type of interneuron are not consistent with a powerful feedforward inhibitory connection to either type of SPN. Again, this result resonates with our anatomical data showing that, although PV+/Scgn+ interneuron preferentially target dSPNs, these interneurons form fewer putative somatic synapses and fewer appositions on a given SPN soma. Taken together, these observations suggest that the diverse properties of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons position them to fulfil different roles in the striatal circuit."

These analyses were necessarily based on comparisons of two sets of PV+ interneurons that were first divided according to their selective expression of Scgn. This raises the issue of whether PV+ interneurons can be segregated into two or more discrete groups on the basis of their electrophysiological properties alone. If they can be segregated, this raises the further issue of whether the discrete interneuron groups differ with respect to their expression of Scgn. To address these issues, we performed unsupervised hierarchical cluster analyses of the electrophysiological parameters of PV+ interneurons (omitting information on whether or not they expressed Scgn) together with those of cholinergic interneurons and GABAergic interneurons that co-express nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). We included ChAT+ interneurons and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons because they are widely accepted to be discrete cell types (<a href=\"#bib79\">Tepper and Bolam, 2004</a>) and, as such, can be used as comparators; if PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons can be distinguished to the same degree as ChAT+ and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons can be distinguished (from each other and/or from the subpopulations of PV+ interneurons), then this would support the notion that PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons are discrete cell types. Another key advantage of including ChAT+ and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons is that they facilitated the unbiased selection of the electrophysiological parameters to analyze; parameters were thus selected according to their utility for segregating one or more of the populations of ChAT+ interneurons, PV+ interneurons (as a whole) and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons, rather than their ability to distinguish PV+/Scgn- from PV+/Scgn+ interneurons per se."

Because the firing rates and patterns of striatal interneurons varies considerably between SWA and cortical activation (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sharott et al., 2012</a>), we performed separate cluster analyses for parameters recorded in each brain state. For activity during SWA, we analyzed a total of 65 interneurons; 36 ChAT+, 12 NOS+/NPY+ and 17 PV+ interneurons. Three measures of interneuron firing regularity/pattern (Log ISI 10, CV ISI and CV2 ratio; see Materials and methods) and 4 measures of interneuron locking to population oscillations in the ECoG (LFP peak, SWA Vec., Spin. Vec and Gam. Vec; see Materials and methods) were used for clustering (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10Ai</a>, <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 10\u2014source data 1</a>). When these 7 parameters were analyzed across all interneuron populations, 5 significant clusters emerged (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>).

The three remaining clusters were composed of a clear majority of PV+/Scgn-, PV+/Scgn+ or NOS+/NPY+ interneurons. The PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons were therefore segregated to a similar degree as the ChAT+ and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons. When the ChAT+ interneurons were removed and the analysis repeated, the GABAergic interneurons segregated into 3 significant clusters with a slightly improved clustering of the NOS+/NPY+ interneurons and a similar separation of the two PV+ populations to the larger analysis (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). With the removal of NOS+/NPY+ interneurons, the segregation of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn- interneurons was largely maintained (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). When only the 4 measures of interneuron locking were used in the analysis, PV+ interneurons were segregated into two significant clusters with &gt;85% correlation with Scgn expression (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>).

When the ChAT+ interneurons were removed and the analysis repeated, the NOS+/NPY+, PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons remained significantly segregated to similar degrees (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G</a>). These data show that, during cortical activation, PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- interneurons are as distinct from each other as either subpopulation is from ChAT+ or NOS+/NPY+ interneurons. When the analysis was repeated after removal of NOS+/NPY+ interneurons, 3 significant clusters emerged, one of which was composed entirely of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10H</a>). Interestingly, the remaining PV+ interneurons, which were mostly Scgn-, were divided into two clusters. This concurs with our ISI histogram correlation analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) that indicated that the firing patterns of PV+/Scgn- interneurons are more variable than those of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons."

These properties can be defined using molecular, structural and physiological features (<a href=\"#bib63\">Petilla Interneuron Nomenclature et al., 2008</a>). Exemplars of the utility of such a multi-level definition of GABAergic cell type include the discrimination of myriad types of hippocampal interneuron (<a href=\"#bib41\">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</a>) and the cellular dichotomy recently revealed in the external globus pallidus (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abdi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Mallet et al., 2012</a>). In both of these cases, a specific combination of molecular markers can be used as the primary or sufficient indicators of the unique set of structural and physiological properties. Combinations of markers have also proved useful for parsing some types of GABAergic interneuron in the rodent striatum. For example, interneurons expressing NPY can be separated according to whether or not they also express NOS and/or somatostatin; those expressing NPY, but not NOS, have a completely distinctive anatomical and physiological phenotype (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ibanez-Sandoval et al., 2011</a>) and specific role in the microcircuit (<a href=\"#bib19\">English et al., 2012</a>) as compared to NPY+/NOS+ interneurons. In contrast, striatal PV+ interneurons have generally been treated as a homogenous population. The findings presented here describing the molecular profiles, distribution, structure and firing of striatal PV+ interneurons converge to suggest that striatal PV+ interneurons in rats and monkeys comprise at least two discrete cell types. The unsupervised cluster analysis of PV+ interneuron firing during cortical activation suggested this heterogeneity may extend further."

While PV+/Scgn+ interneurons constituted around 30% and 75% of all PV+ interneurons in rats and primates respectively, Scgn was only expressed by a small minority of PV+ interneurons (&lt;1%) in mice. Because Scgn-expressing neurons could be observed in other brain regions of mice, the scarcity of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in mouse striatum was thus unlikely to be due to a technical/detection issue. The paucity of Scgn co-expression in mouse PV+ interneurons suggests the molecular diversity we elucidate here does not tally with that defined by the selective, but more widespread, expression of serotonin receptor subunit 3A (<a href=\"#bib56\">Munoz-Manchado et al., 2016</a>). However, it would be important to test in the future whether Scgn expression in rat and primate striatum correlates with expression of this receptor subunit. It is possible that mouse striatum still contains a sub-population of PV+ interneurons that have the same anatomical and physiological properties as the PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in rats. Even if this scenario were true, however, the fact that such mouse interneurons lack Scgn suggests they would handle calcium differently compared to rat/primate interneurons that co-express Scgn. Moreover, given the increasing use of genetically-altered mice for identifying and manipulating specific neuronal populations based on their selective gene expression, the finding that a combination of molecular markers is so prominent in the rat and primate but absent in the mouse striatum is noteworthy. Indeed, further study of the functional properties of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons using, for example, cell-type-specific optical or pharmacogenetic methods, would likely require a double-transgenic rat, the generation of which would present a considerable technical challenge. However, this does not alter the likelihood that, although many elements of striatal circuits are likely conserved across mice, rats and primates, a focus on mice as a model organism could potentially miss important substrates of interneuron diversity that are conserved along different phylogenetic paths."

In rat, PV+/Scgn+ interneurons were distributed across the entire striatum, but their density dramatically increased in caudal aspects (such that they outnumbered PV+/Scgn- interneurons by &gt;10 to 1). These caudal striatal territories receive converging inputs from, in particular, most areas of prefrontal (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hoover and Vertes, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Mailly et al., 2013</a>), entorhinal (<a href=\"#bib54\">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</a>), prelimbic (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mailly et al., 2013</a>), visual (<a href=\"#bib20\">Faull et al., 1986</a>) and auditory cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib54\">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Xiong et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, PV+/Scgn- interneurons were evenly distributed throughout striatum, with the exception of caudal territories where they were sparse. Thus, corticostriatal neurons in areas of rat cortex that heavily innervate caudal striatum could gain privileged access to PV+/Scgn+ interneurons. On the other hand, in rostral and central territories of striatum, which receive denser and more widespread inputs from somatosensory and motor cortical areas, PV+/Scgn- interneurons outnumbered PV+/Scgn+ interneurons by at least 3:1. Thus, corticostriatal neurons in \u2018somato-motor\u2019 areas of rat cortex are particularly well positioned to engage PV+/Scgn- interneurons."

The somatosensory/motor cortical areas in primates comprise a far smaller fraction of the entire cortical mantle than in rodents, particularly in relation to prefrontal, association and visual cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brodmann, 1909</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Buckner and Krienen, 2013</a>). In line with this change in relative cortical volume, combinations of afferents from prefrontal, association and visual cortices of primates innervate large areas of the caudate and putamen across most of their rostro-caudal axes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Calzavara et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Haber and Knutson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Yeterian and Pandya, 1998</a>), whereas corticostriatal neurons in motor and somatosensory cortical areas primarily target the lateral putamen (<a href=\"#bib21\">Flaherty and Graybiel, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Inase et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Parent and Parent, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Takada et al., 1998</a>). These differences in the sources and sizes of corticostriatal innervation are partly correlated with the relative densities and distributions of the two populations of striatal PV+ interneurons in the primate. Unlike in the rat, PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in primates were three times as dense as PV+/Scgn- interneurons across the entire rostro-caudal extent of striatum. In further contrast to the rat, PV+/Scgn- interneurons were clustered in lateral aspects of the putamen. Thus, the relative switch in prevalence of the two PV+ interneuron populations in the two species is roughly in line with the relative difference in prevalence of somatosensory/motor corticostriatal projections versus prefrontal, associative, visual and auditory corticostriatal projections. There was another notable similarity between rat and macaque, namely that the density of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons increased in caudal territories. Both rat caudal striatum (<a href=\"#bib20\">Faull et al., 1986</a>) and primate caudal caudate receive dense inputs from visual cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gattass et al., 2014</a>), which could possibly explain this shared relationship."

Approximately 50% of PV-immunoreactive terminals in the striatum form symmetric synapses with putative SPN somata (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bennett and Bolam, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kita et al., 1990</a>). While some of these terminals could originate from neurons in external globus pallidus (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bevan et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Mallet et al., 2012</a>), a much larger proportion are likely to originate from PV+ interneurons (<a href=\"#bib42\">Koos and Tepper, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kubota and Kawaguchi, 2000</a>). Thus, PV+ interneurons in striatum have generally been thought to play a similar circuit role to basket cells in cortex. We found that, as compared to outputs of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons, the PV+/Scgn- interneurons formed almost twice as many putative somatic synapses and formed more appositions on a given SPN soma. From our experiments, we can only speculate on the identities of other targets innervated by PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- interneurons. While it seems likely that these interneurons form some synapses with SPN dendrites, we cannot rule out that the somata and/or dendrites of interneurons are also targeted. Whatever their targets, our results suggest that different subpopulations of striatal PV+ interneuron could also underlie the considerable variability in the cellular compartments targeted by individual PV+ interneuron axons (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kubota and Kawaguchi, 2000</a>)."

Our findings suggest that the innervation of SPNs by PV+ interneurons in the rat and primate is considerably more complex. In the context of targeting SPN somata, we found that PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons had a considerable bias towards innervating iSPNs and dSPNs, respectively. The terminals of corticostriatal neurons show little selectivity for the two SPN populations (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doig et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Guo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kress et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wall et al., 2013</a>). The biased innervation of SPNs by two different types of PV+ interneuron may, therefore, provide a novel mechanism through which corticostriatal neurons can selectively influence one or the other output pathway. The utility of this mechanism would be further enhanced by the high sensitivity of PV+ interneurons to cortical input (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gittis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mallet et al., 2005</a>) and/or by any differences in the temporal organisation of PV+/Scgn- and PV/Scgn+ interneuron activities. We observed that the firing of these two types of PV+ interneuron was temporally distinct with respect to the slow oscillations present in the striatum during SWA; PV+/Scgn- interneurons fired earlier than PV+/Scgn+ interneurons. Selective innervation of iSPNs by PV+/Scgn- interneurons might thus explain why the firing of iSPNs was delayed compared to that of dSPNs. In contrast, the relative timing of PV+/Scgn+ interneuron firing and dSPN firing would not be consistent with a powerful feedforward inhibitory circuit. In the future, in vitro recordings of synaptically-connected pairs of PV+ interneurons and SPNs should provide further insights into the predicted functional impact of the selective targeting of the somata of dSPNs and iSPNs."

The strong temporal relationships between the firing of PV+ interneurons or FSIs to cortical oscillations is also well described in striatum (<a href=\"#bib8\">Berke, 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sharott et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib70\">2009</a>). Thus, it was notable that PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons displayed differences in the incidence, strengths and timings of their phase-locked firing to different cortical rhythms. This could be the result of these two interneuron populations receiving different cortical inputs with different oscillatory signatures. Alternatively, variance in the intrinsic properties of these interneurons could result in a different output in response to the same oscillatory inputs. Whatever the underlying mechanism, our results highlight that the physiological differences of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons extend to their disparate engagement in behaviorally-relevant network oscillations in the corticostriatal circuit. In addition, the firing pattern within the PV+/Scgn+ interneurons was as similar to each other as to that of cholinergic interneurons, which have relatively homogenous firing patterns (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sharott et al., 2012</a>).

A recent study in mice demonstrated feedforward inhibition of SPNs in striosomes, but not matrix compartment, of rostro-medial striatum by afferents from prelimbic cortex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Friedman et al., 2015</a>). Optogenetic manipulation of this corticostriatal/inhibitory-interneuron pathway specifically altered performance in cost/benefit decision making, illustrating that inhibitory interneurons can enable cortical afferents from a single area to selectively mediate a subset of striatal outputs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Friedman et al., 2015</a>). We propose that PV+/Scgn+ interneurons may instantiate a similar mechanism, whereby associative, visual and auditory cortical inputs can selectively inhibit dSPNs. Consistent with this idea, the caudal striatum of rats has been shown to mediate the association of auditory stimuli with rewarding actions (<a href=\"#bib84\">Xiong et al., 2015</a>). The proliferation of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in the macaque striatum could reflect the increase in such decision-making capabilities required by the corticostriatal system of primates."

In order to image each fluorescence channel, the following sets of filter cubes were used: AMCA (excitation 299\u2013392 nm, beamsplitter 395 nm, emission 420\u2013470 nm); AlexaFluor-488 (excitation 450\u2013490 nm, beamsplitter 495 nm, emission 500\u2013550 nm); Cy3 (excitation 532\u2013558 nm, beamsplitter 570 nm, emission 570\u2013640 nm); and DyLight 649 (excitation 625\u2013655 nm, beamsplitter 660 nm, emission 665\u2013715 nm). Imaging was subsequently performed by capturing a series of completely tessellated, z-stacked images (each 1 \u00b5m thick) at depths from 2 to 12 \u00b5m from the upper surface of each section at the level of the striatum (thereby defining a 10 \u00b5m-thick optical disector). As counts were performed across the entirety of the dorsal striatum within a given rostro-caudal plane, the grid size and counting frame were set to the same size of 420 x 320 \u00b5m. In order to calculate the coefficient of error associated with each count (CE \u2013 also referred to as the Gundersen coefficient), the point counting method option of the StereoInvestigator 9.0 software (MBF Biosciences) was applied. In all trials, the mean CE was 0.03."

Due to the striatum\u2019s irregular shape across its 3 dimensions, horizontal and vertical lines were first 'drawn' from the position of each interneuron within a given coronal plane to the contours of striatum. Each interneuron was then assigned a value of between -1 and 1 according to its relative distance from the lateral and medial borders of striatum at that same coronal plane and to its distance from dorsal and ventral borders. A value of 0 indicated that an interneuron was positioned equidistantly from both striatal borders (e.g. the medial and lateral borders of striatum for the medio-lateral axis). Notably, all distance values were calculated according to the first points along the striatal contours that were contacted by the horizontal and vertical lines drawn from each interneurons position. In this manner, the definition of 'medial' and 'lateral' striatum was shifted depending on the position of the interneuron in the dorso-ventral plane; due to the irregular shape of the striatum. Likewise, the definition of 'dorsal' and 'ventral' striatum was also shifted depending on an interneuron\u2019s position in the medio-lateral plane."

In order to compare the mean positional values of two different interneuron populations along the medio-lateral or dorso-ventral axis within a given coronal plane, the Mann-Whitney U test was performed. When a section contained \u22645 neurons of a given type, positional analysis was not performed in either plane as variance became too great to give meaningful averages. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) method in order to avoid false positives (<a href=\"#bib58\">Noble, 2009</a>). The minimum significance level for all statistical tests was taken to be p\u22640.05. To compare the variance in the distribution of neurons in the medio-lateral and dorso-ventral planes across the rostrocaudal axis, the difference in the mean normalised ML and DV values for a single coronal section and all other coronal sections was averaged. The absolute value of this measure could then be used to compare the variances of ML and DV positions of different interneuron types across different species using a Kruskal Wallis ANOVA. This measure was thus sensitive to changes in the mean position across the different coronal sections, but would yield low values if there was a consistent bias across all sections."

Sections containing neurobiotin-labelled cell bodies were isolated and subjected to further molecular characterization by indirect immunofluorescence. Neurons with dendritic spines were defined as spiny projections neurons (SPNs). Neurons that were suspected to be SPNs, but that did not have well labelled dendrites were tested for Ctip2 expression (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arlotta et al., 2008</a>). Some confirmed SPNs were additionally tested for the expression of PPE (see below). Neurons that did not express the SPN marker Ctip2 and/or that possessed aspiny dendrites were tested for their expression of the major striatal interneuron markers, including parvalbumin (PV), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). The initial molecular marker tested was guided by the labeled cell\u2019s somatodendritic structure, and once a positive expression for one of these markers was established, no other classical marker was tested since these molecules are rarely co-expressed, except for NOS and NPY (Kawaguchi et al., 1995). The expression of these markers was tested using the same indirect immunofluorescence protocol used for stereological cell counting."

Electrocorticogram signals containing robust SWA or cortical activation were first filtered, using a neutral-phase bandpass filter (1\u20133 order Butterworth filter,) in 107 overlapping frequency bands with exponentially increasing center frequencies of 1-80\u00a0Hz and increasing widths of the plus/minus 1.5x the center frequency. The instantaneous phase and power of the ECoG in these frequency bands were separately calculated from the analytic signal obtained via the Hilbert transform (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lachaux et al., 1999</a>). In this formalism, peaks in the ECoG oscillations correspond to a phase of 0\u00b0 and troughs to a phase of 180\u00b0. Circular phase plots and circular statistical measures were calculated using the instantaneous phase values for each spike in relation to each frequency band. Descriptive and inferential circular statistics were then calculated using the CircStat toolbox (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berens, 2009</a>) for MATLAB. We included only those neurons that fired \u226540 spikes during the analyzed epoch. Phase histograms were constructed using 20 phase bins and used to construct pseudocolor plots of probability of firing as a function of phase for each frequency band. These neurons were then tested for significant phase-locked firing in each frequency band (defined as having p&lt;0.05 in Rayleigh\u2019s Uniformity Test). The null hypothesis for Rayleigh\u2019s test was that the spike data were distributed in a uniform manner. The power of the ECoG in the SWA band was compared in data epochs used for analyses of phase-locked striatal neuron firing to test whether they were significantly different between groups. For frequencies below 5\u00a0Hz, Rayleigh tests were only carried out after any phase non-uniformities of the slow oscillations were corrected with the empirical cumulative distribution function (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nakamura et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Siapas et al., 2005</a>)."

The polarity of the LFP was inverted (iLFP) so that peaks in the slow oscillation would correspond to the synchronized peaks in the membrane potential of many SPNs, often referred to as 'up states' (<a href=\"#bib32\">Goto and O'Donnell, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wilson et al., 1990</a>). iLFP signals containing robust SWA were first filtered, using a neutral-phase bandpass filter (2nd order Butterworth filter) between 0.4 and 1.6\u00a0Hz. The instantaneous phase of the LFP slow oscillation the analytic signal obtained via the Hilbert transform. iLFP peaks were then defined as the period between each trough (i.e. \u2013\u03c0 to \u03c0). Each iLFP peak was then divided in to 100 time bins, irrespective of the total length of the peak in time, and a histogram of action potential firing was calculated for over these time bins (nominally assigned values from \u22121 to 1). Using this 'normalized time' approach, the time of action potential firing was not dependent on the duration of the iLFP peak, which can vary considerably between cycles. iLFP peaks that were shorter or longer than the period corresponding to the boundaries of the filter (i.e. 0.625\u00a0s and 2.5\u00a0s) were discarded. The median firing time of all spikes on the normalized time scale was used to compare the relationship of each neuronal population to the iLFP peak using a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks with post-hoc Dunn tests."

Clustering was performed on 10000 surrogate data sets created by randomly shuffling the value for each electrophysiological parameter and the differences between within cluster distances calculated for each surrogate. This null distribution, therefore, gave the within-cluster differences that would occur if the electrophysiological parameters were distributed randomly and was used to calculate p-values for the real data (i.e. the probability that the difference between successive within-cluster distances occurred by chance). The threshold for cluster separation was taken as the midpoint between the two within-cluster distances whose difference produced the lowest p-value &lt; 0.05.

They describe a differential anatomical distribution and proportion of this newly described striatal populations when comparing it to the PV positive /Scgn negative striatal interneurons in the rat. Interestingly they report a bigger proportion of the PV/Scgn positive striatal interneuron in the primate caudate-putamen. Furthermore by performing electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized rats they show that the spiking of the PV/Scgn positive vs. the PV positive /Scgn negative striatal interneuron is differently locked to cortical oscillations. Finally by performing elegant immunofluorescence experiments from some of the recorded/labeled cells in vivo they identify that the PV/Scgn positive striatal interneurons targeted preferentially the direct pathway SPN. Based on the analysis of the presented results, the fact that this newly described population of striatal interneurons is described in the absence of genetically modified manipulations in primates and rodents, and that the results fulfill the current requirements to describe a population of neurons (anatomical marker and functional specificities) make this reviewer incline to accept this manuscript for publication in <i>eLife</i> considering the following comments and when stated further experiments."

It should be noted, however, that not all data sets are amenable to such cluster analysis. We have now performed an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of the electrophysiological parameters of interneurons we recorded in vivo (see below). Although we were not able to perform a cluster analysis of our anatomical (cell count) data, we have nevertheless performed a new complementary analysis to address the spirit of the reviewer\u2019s comment here. More specifically, we have now provided careful estimates of whether and to what extent the spatial distributions of all PV+ interneurons as a whole could be explained by the selective expression of Scgn (see Results subsection \u201cSelective expression of secretagogin divides the PV+ interneuron population in rat striatum but not in mouse striatum\u201d, last two paragraphs and new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E-J</a>). We now show in rats that the distribution biases of all PV+ interneurons are similar to those of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons, suggesting the presence of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons biases the entire PV+ interneuron population. In line with this, there was no consistent or strong bias in the relative positions of PV+/Scgn- interneurons. To further explore the notion that the biased distributions of rat PV+ interneurons can be largely explained by Scgn expression, we also analyzed the spatial distributions of all PV+ interneurons in the mouse dorsal striatum, which contains a tiny number of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons. There was no consistent or strong bias in the relative positions of all PV+ interneurons in mice. Thus, we can now conclude from this new analysis, that: (1) the highly unusual spatial distribution of rat PV+/Scgn+ interneurons accounts for much of the non-uniform distribution of all PV+ interneurons in rats; and (2) mouse PV+ interneurons lack Scgn and are more uniformly distributed. Taken together, these data serve to reinforce that Scgn is a useful and highly relevant marker for dividing PV+ interneuron populations."

To increase confidence in these initial results, we have now performed an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analyses of the electrophysiological parameters of PV+ interneurons (omitting information as to whether or not they expressed Scgn) together with those of cholinergic interneurons and GABAergic interneurons that co-express nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). We included ChAT+ interneurons and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons because they are widely accepted to be discrete cell types and, as such, can be used as comparators; if PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons can be distinguished to the same degree as ChAT+ and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons can be distinguished (from each other and/or from the subpopulations of PV+ interneurons), then this would support the notion that PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons are discrete cell types. Another key advantage of including ChAT+ and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons is that they facilitated the unbiased selection of the electrophysiological parameters to analyze; parameters were thus selected according to their utility for segregating one or more of the populations of ChAT+ interneurons, PV+ interneurons (as a whole) and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons, rather than their ability to distinguish PV+/Scgn- from PV+/Scgn+ interneurons per se. The cluster analysis was performed with standard methods (Squared Euclidian Distance, Ward\u2019s method) together with non-parametric resampling-based version of Thorndike's method to provide a probabilistic evaluation of the number of clusters (which, importantly, using this method could be 1. i.e. no segregation). As now shown in new <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> and reported in the Results (subsection \u201cHierarchical clustering of striatal interneurons using electrophysiological parameters is highly correlated with their molecular identities\u201d), the cluster analysis showed that interneurons segregated into significant clusters. After assignment of molecular identities, it was evident that these clusters were predominantly composed of ChAT+ interneurons, NOS+/NPY+ interneurons, PV+/Scgn+ interneurons, and PV+/Scgn- interneurons, respectively. The cluster analysis also showed that PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- interneurons are as distinct from each other as either subpopulation is from NOS+/NPY+ or ChAT+ interneurons. In brief, these unsupervised cluster analyses confirm not only that PV+ interneurons can be segregated into two discrete groups on the basis of their electrophysiological properties alone (in two brain states), but also that these discrete interneuron groups differ with respect to their Scgn expression. Taken together, these data further support the notion that rat PV+ interneurons are comprised of two main subpopulations, and that selective expression of Scgn is a robust and useful metric for distinguishing between them."

Thus, it is reasonable to state that electrophysiological recordings from identified PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in mice are well beyond the scope of this study (and the journal\u2019s timeline for re-submission). This being the case, we cannot explore a population division in mice beyond our careful quantification of Scgn expression. The results of our anatomical analysis are unambiguous; Scgn expression is very rare in mouse PV+ interneurons. However, we have taken care to state in the Discussion (third paragraph) that it is still possible that mouse striatum contains a sub-population of PV+ interneurons that have the same anatomical and physiological properties as the PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in rats."

However, with respect to our study, which is necessarily focused on the use of wildtype adult animals, there are several major obstacles to be overcome in such experiments: (1) PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- neurons in living slices cannot be visualised in advance to guide the recordings. This means that less than 1 in 100 intracellular recordings would yield an interneuron of the desired type. It would take much time to gather a sufficiently robust sample of interneurons; (2) There is a confounding combinatorial factor, in that 4 types of connection would have to be studied before firm conclusions could be drawn, i.e. PV+/Scgn- to dSPN, PV+/Scgn- to iSPN, PV+/Scgn+ to dSPN and PV+/Scgn+ to iSPN; (3) The synaptic connections in question are selective, not specific. This means that statistical verification of preferential connectivity would require many pairs exhibiting each of the 4 types of connection. (4) Synaptic connectivity can be sparse in slices. The relevant literature suggests that synaptic connectivity will not be detected in a substantial number of paired recordings; (5) The molecular identities of all record neurons would have to be verified post hoc; and (6) All recordings would have be made in slices taken from adult animals. In summary then, it is clear that such in vitro work is far beyond the technical and temporal scope of the current study. However, we have now highlighted in the Discussion (eighth paragraph) that, in the future, in vitro recordings of synaptically-connected pairs of neurons should provide useful insights."

Our new experiments and analyses are not only designed to provide electrophysiological correlates of the selective innervation of iSPNs and dSPNs, but also to simultaneously address an influential concept, namely that striatal PV+ interneurons are considered to provide \u201cfeedforward\u201d inhibition to SPNs. Our anatomical data suggest that PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons selectively innervate iSPNs and dSPNs, respectively. When our anatomical observations are placed within a framework of feedforward inhibition in vivo, one might predict that, first, the firing of PV+/Scgn- interneurons is more likely to precede the firing of iSPNs than dSPNs, and secondly, that the firing of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons is more likely to precede the firing of dSPNs than iSPNs. To test these predictions, we have recorded robust samples of identified dSPNs and iSPNs in anesthetized rats during cortical SWA (i.e. under conditions identical to those under which the PV+ interneurons were recorded). We then quantitatively compared the spike timings of these SPNs with those of the PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons. As now shown in new <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> and reported in the Results (subsection \u201cPV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons differ in their temporal relationships with striatal projection neurons of the direct and indirect pathways\u201d), we have discovered that: (1) the spike timings of dSPNs and iSPNs are distinct; (2) the spike timings of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons are distinct; (3) PV+/Scgn- interneurons fire significantly earlier than iSPNs but not dSPNs; and (4) PV+/Scgn+ interneurons do not fire before iSPNs or dSPNs. These electrophysiological data verify the first prediction above with respect to possible substrates for feedforward inhibition, that is, the firing of PV+/Scgn- interneurons is indeed more likely to precede the firing of iSPNs than dSPNs. This result is consistent with our anatomical data. The firing of PV+/Scgn+ interneuron firing with respect to dSPN firing is not consistent with a powerful feedforward inhibitory connection to either type of SPN. Again, this result resonates with our anatomical data showing that, although PV+/Scgn+ interneuron preferentially target dSPNs, these interneurons form fewer putative somatic synapses and fewer appositions on a given SPN soma. Taken together, these new experiments provide a compelling corroboration of our anatomical data, and further reinforce our original conclusion that the diverse properties of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons position them to fulfil different roles in the striatal circuit."

The results of our new analysis are presented in new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E-J</a> and discussed in the Results subsection \u201cSelective expression of secretagogin divides the PV+ interneuron population in rat striatum but not in mouse striatum\u201d, last two paragraphs. In short, we found no quantitative evidence of a consistent or clear \u201cdorsolateral\u201d bias in the distribution of all PV+ interneurons in the striatum of rats. This discrepancy with respect to Luk &amp; Sadikot (2001) presumably arises from differences in the extent to which different regions of striatum were sampled as well as in the cell-counting methodologies/analyses used in each study. For example, we sampled from 13 coronal planes (rather than 1 plane as used by Luk &amp; Sadikot) and we calculated the relative position of each counted neuron in the mediolateral or dorsoventral axes (rather than calculate densities, which would require binning of counts into arbitrarily defined areas, such as the \u201cquadrants\u201d used by Luk &amp; Sadikot). Our method of quantifying biases in spatial distributions is comprehensive and objective, thus offering several advantages as compared to previous methods."

Accurate reconstruction of the dendrites and axons of several PV+/Scgn+ interneurons as well as several PV+/Scgn- interneurons is needed to address this point (please see above for explanation why z-stacks are challenging and could be misleading). Drawing on our experience of cell reconstructions, and having consulted with experts in the field (Paul Bolam, Gilad Silberberg) who have attempted to reconstruct the axons of striatal PV+ interneurons, we conservatively estimate that each interneuron reconstruction would take several weeks of full-time work to complete.

However, with its functional significance remaining obscure, this fact remains little more than an oddity that is not unique to striatal interneurons as reported by Garas and colleagues. The differential regional distribution of SCGN+/PV+ and SCGN-/PV+ interneurons across the caudal-rostral axis of the striatum is interesting but \u2013 in the current state of the study \u2013 again does not lead to further insights or testable hypothesis. Thus, like many other results of this study \u2013 all technically sound and interesting findings in their own right \u2013 they are interesting starting points in need of further more focused exploration. The electrophysiological characterization of the SCGN+/PV+ and SCGN-/PV+ neurons presented by the authors and the respective coupling to cortical activity states does show partial overlap and argues rather for gradual differences between striatal interneurons than presenting a strong case for categorical differences \u2013 as for comparison is well established for distinct PV+ subpopulations in hippocampus. Also, the differential innervation of putative direct versus indirect pathway medium spiny neurons is another interesting starting point of an in depth study evaluation the functional consequences of this finding. In summary, this study is a \u2013 relatively loose \u2013 collection of interesting findings \u2013 however, none of them is really followed up to reveal important novel insights about distinct functional classes of striatal interneurons \u2013 expected to be delivered to warrant publication in a top journal and of interest to wide readership.

We emphasise that this combined and correlative analysis is exactly what we have provided here for PV+ interneurons of the striatum. The advanced multidisciplinary approach we have used is not only rigorous and quantitative, but is also particularly well suited to deployment in studies of wildtype animals. Indeed, we view the comparative use of wildtype animals of three species to be a key strength of our paper. One can imagine using additional techniques if the appropriate genetically-altered animals were available for study (but, as we highlight in the Discussion, they are not available)."

With regards to necessity, our new hierarchical cluster analysis (see above and <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>) has confirmed that not only can the PV+ interneuron population be segregated on the basis of physiological parameters alone, but also that this segregation correlates very well with the selective expression of just one additional marker, that is, secretagogin. Furthermore, our new anatomical analyses (see above and new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) has verified that the non-uniform spatial distribution of all PV+ interneurons in rat striatum can be explained by selective Scgn expression. Thus, in support of our original conclusions, selective Scgn expression is sufficient for discriminating between functionally diverse subpopulations of PV+ interneurons. With respect to feasibility, it would not be possible to complete a transcriptomics analysis of striatal interneurons of three different species in a timely manner. Again, we are mindful that many applications of single-cell transcriptomics in the central nervous system rely on the use of genetically-altered animals. Indeed, laser-capture microdissection of striatal neurons in double-immunolabeled fixed tissue (as would currently be required to identify PV+/Scgn+ and PV/Scgn- neurons in wildtype animals) would be extremely challenging."

It is a challenge to determine whether PV+ interneurons of the hippocampus would yield similarly clear results when subjected to a hierarchical cluster analysis; to our knowledge, we are the first to perform such an analysis on multiple types of interneurons recorded in vivo."
