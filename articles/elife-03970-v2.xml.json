Clathrin-coated pits are well defined, but the identity, mechanism and function of alternative pathways have been controversial. Here we apply universal chemical labelling of plasma membrane proteins to define all primary endocytic vesicles, and labelling of specific proteins with a reducible SNAP-tag substrate. These approaches provide high temporal resolution and stringent discrimination between surface-connected and intracellular membranes. We find that at least 95% of the earliest detectable endocytic vesicles arise from clathrin-coated pits. GPI-anchored proteins, candidate cargoes for alternate pathways, are also found to enter the cell predominantly via coated pits. Experiments employing a mutated clathrin adaptor reveal distinct mechanisms for sorting into coated pits, and thereby explain differential effects on the uptake of transferrin and GPI-anchored proteins. These data call for a revision of models for the activity and diversity of endocytic pathways in mammalian cells."

However, the details of how these other types of endocytosis work and how important they are for moving molecules into the cell remain unclear. This is partly because it is difficult to identify particular types of endocytosis. Previous attempts to do this have involved trying to identify molecules that are specifically and solely associated with that type of endocytosis, and using these to track the vesicle. However, few\u2014if any\u2014such molecules are known for clathrin-independent methods of endocytosis. Another approach is to inhibit the formation of clathrin-coated pits and study those molecules that are still taken into cells. The problem here is that incomplete inhibition can make interpreting the results difficult. Furthermore, complete inhibition of an important process like clathrin-dependent endocytosis is likely to have severe effects on many other aspects of cell function."

Importantly, this new method can provide very accurate information as to whether or not proteins have been included in vesicles, and this may provide advantages over previous approaches."

The apparent presence of these proteins in endosomes devoid of transferrin, and uptake in the presence of inhibitors of clathrin-coated pits, provides evidence for GPI-enriched endosomal compartments (GEECs) that are fed from the cell surface independently from coated pits (<a href=\"#bib68\">Sabharanjak et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kumari and Mayor, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bhagatji et al., 2009</a>).

This would allow simultaneous evaluation of a large number of cargoes and their relationship with clathrin and putative non-clathrin markers. In this study we apply a combination of new and established methods that satisfy these requirements, and thereby provide a systematic and quantitative analysis of total endocytic protein flux in cultured mammalian cells."

The biotin moiety can be removed from labelled proteins by reduction of the disulfide bond with membrane-impermeant sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNa) at 4\u00b0C, so this approach provides a powerful way to detect internalisation of surface proteins (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bretscher and Lutter, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schmid and Smythe, 1991</a>). We assessed the efficiency of MESNa treatment in removing biotin from sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin-labelled proteins, and compared this with two widely used alternatives, washing at low pH to remove antibodies bound to the outside of the cell and cleavage of extracellular GPI-anchors with PI-PLC (<a href=\"#bib68\">Sabharanjak et al., 2002</a>). MESNa treatment could remove over 99.9% of biotin from cells labelled at 4\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Washes at pH3 to remove bound antibody, or PI-PLC to cleave GPI-anchors, were around two orders of magnitude less efficient, removing up to 50% and 90% of antibody bound to the GPI-anchored protein CD59 respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davies et al., 1989</a>).

Endocytic vesicles detected after MESNa treatment were small puncta (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Approximately 2% of the cells also contained distinctively larger macropinosomes over 500 nm in diameter (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In order to determine the identity of the endocytic vesicles we carried out co-internalisation experiments with the archetypical high-affinity cargo for clathrin-coated pits, transferrin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib73\">Schmid and Smythe, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hansen et al., 1992</a>). The great majority of endocytic vesicles contained transferrin, and therefore are likely to have arisen from clathrin-coated pits. Uptake of transferrin was solely due to binding to transferrin receptor, as large, fluid-filled macropinosomes were completely devoid of transferrin (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Residual surface-bound transferrin was detected as puncta, and co-localised with clathrin, implying concentration in nascent coated pits (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We used unbiased and semi-automated quantification, involving application of a mask derived from the image of fluorescent transferrin, to determine the proportion of biotin-positive pixels that also contained transferrin in multiple cell images (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This revealed that over 95% of the total internalised biotin after 20 s uptake was present in transferrin-positive vesicles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

This improved signal to noise ratio and thereby improved temporal resolution, but at the same time cooling and rapid warming could have an effect on the endocytic machinery (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boucrot et al., 2010</a>). We sought to perform the endocytic assay in unperturbed cells, under more physiological conditions, by omitting the pre-incubation step at 4\u00b0C. Cells were labelled with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and transferrin at 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The earliest time after initiation of labelling at which endocytic vesicles could be reliably detected was 90 s, presumably because of the time taken for sufficient reaction of the NHS ester with primary amines at the cell surface. Consistent with the results when labelling was carried out at 4\u00b0C, nearly all of the internalised protein labelled with biotin was indeed present in transferrin-positive vesicles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Another concern was that HeLa cells could be in some way atypical, so we repeated the same experiments in Cos7 and RPE cells. Again, there was near-complete co-localisation between endocytosed sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and transferrin after 90 s uptake at 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>)."

Extraction of the dye with label-free medium reversed plasma membrane labelling and provided a means of identifying FM1-43FX-positive intracellular vesicles. Although this may not provide such stringent topological discrimination between intracellular vesicles and surface membrane as the sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin plus MESNa approach, there was a very high degree of co-localisation between FM1-43FX-positive puncta and transferrin (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>).

Biotin-positive endocytic vesicles were identified as 3D objects using the Imaris software, and the transferrin cargo load was calculated based on the mean transferrin intensity within each vesicle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). In order to account for background signal generated by experimental noise or random overlap, the transferrin channel was offset by 500 nm from its correct register, and transferrin intensity in the same objects was sampled for a second time. (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The 95th percentile of this background intensity distribution was used as a cut-off to define transferrin-negative endocytic vesicles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Applying this conservative criterion, after 90 s continuous labelling and uptake 96% of 2350 vesicles contained transferrin, and after labelling at 4\u00b0C and uptake for 20 s 92% of 2387 vesicles contained transferrin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). A single Gaussian curve could describe the transferrin intensity distribution within most identified vesicles, consistent with stochastic incorporation of transferrin receptors into forming clathrin-coated pits (<a href=\"#bib6\">Collinet et al., 2010</a>). A small population of transferrin-negative objects could be seen as a peak at the lowest end of the intensity distribution, showing that potential transferrin-negative endocytic vesicles, where they exist, can be detected by our method (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We observed no correlation between biotin intensity and the probability of that vesicle not containing transferrin, arguing against the possibility of a morphologically distinctive class of transferrin-negative endocytic vesicle (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We also carried out experiments to test the possibility that the glycosphingolipid-binding B-subunit of cholera toxin (CTB), which has been extensively used as a marker for clathrin-independent endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Henley et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sandvig et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kirkham et al., 2005</a>), induces the formation of transferrin-negative endocytic vesicles. Biotin-positive vesicles were identified as objects in transferrin-labeled cells as described above, with and without addition of CTB. The transferrin load in vesicles in control and CTB treated cells was the same (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The simplest hypothesis arising from these observations is that essentially all proteins taken up by the cell are internalised along with transferrin via clathrin-coated pits. If this is the case, then ablation of coated pit activity should effectively block total endocytosis. Overexpression of the C-terminal clathrin-binding domain of AP180/CALM (AP180-C) provides an efficient means of blocking formation of coated pits (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ford et al., 2001</a>). In cells overexpressing AP180-C, transferrin uptake and endocytosis of total biotinylated protein were both efficiently blocked, with total protein uptake being reduced to less than 5% of control levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Overexpression of the K44A mutant of dynamin blocks budding of clathrin-coated pits (<a href=\"#bib79\">van der Bliek et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Damke et al., 1995</a>). In cells overexpressing dynamin 2 K44A there was efficient reduction of both transferrin and total biotinylated protein uptake to less than 5% of control levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Additionally, we noted that expression of very high levels of the dynamin mutant induced endocytosis of total biotinylated protein in both macropinosomes and smaller vesicular structures (see below). We conclude that formation of the primary vesicles that contribute the large majority of endocytic flux in unperturbed cells is blocked by loss of clathrin or dynamin function."

Proteomic analysis of surface-biotinylated plasma membrane proteins offered a way to test this hypothesis directly. In order to ablate coated pit activity, cells were transfected with siRNA against the alpha adaptin subunit of the clathrin adaptor AP2 (\u2018AP2 siRNA\u2019). This blocked alpha-adaptin expression, and hence AP2 function (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Motley et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">2006</a>). AP2 siRNA blocked both transferrin uptake and uptake of total biotinylated proteins to a similar extent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). SILAC (stable isotopic labelling by amino-acids in culture) followed by precipitation of surface biotinylated proteins with streptavidin-agarose provided a quantitative comparison of the relative abundance of plasma membrane proteins in control and AP2 siRNA treated cells. This revealed a clear and pronounced increase in the abundance of most proteins in AP2-siRNA cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Analysis of SILAC ratios of the non-biotinylated cytosolic proteins present in the flow-through provided an internal control and did not reveal similar changes, confirming that the effects of AP2 depletion are largely restricted to the population of plasma membrane proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

The only obvious pattern within the list is the presence of most GPI-anchored proteins detected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Flow cytometry to assay changes in plasma membrane levels of individual proteins confirmed that AP2 siRNA causes an accumulation of transferrin receptor at the plasma membrane, while levels of the GPI-anchored protein CD59 are reduced (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Uptake of BG-SS-488 was detected only in SNAP-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). All four GPI-anchored proteins co-localised extensively with transferrin after internalisation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). When quantified, around 90% of all BG-SS-488 labelled, internalised GPI-anchored proteins co-localised with transferrin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To assess the biological significance of the residual 10% we used precisely the same quantification method to analyse co-localisation between transferrin-alexa-647 and transferrin-alexa-546, after mixing and adding to cells for simultaneous internalisation. Again we detected around 90% co-localisation, so it is possible that the residual 10% can be accounted for by limitations in quantification rather than a biologically significant pool of GPI-anchored protein internalised separately from transferrin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

We sought to explain this apparent discrepancy. In several of these studies CTB has been used as a marker for clathrin-independent endocytosis. As discussed previously, it was possible that CTB induces clathrin-independent uptake of GPI-anchored proteins. Object-based analysis of the transferrin load within BG-SS-488-positive vesicles in cells expressing SNAP-CD59 argues that this is not the case (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

                                "text": "One type of experiment that can be interpreted as evidence for clathrin-independent endocytosis is the presence of endocytosed protein in vesicles separate from those labelled with transferrin (<a href=\"#bib68\">Sabharanjak et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Glebov et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bhagatji et al., 2009</a>). We did not observe this in the experiments outlined above (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), so we chose to pursue this further by conjugating a monoclonal antibody against CD59 to both alexa-546, and to SS-atto-488 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Importantly, the disulfide bond in SS-atto-488 can be reduced with MESNa as previously. This meant we could follow uptake of endogenous CD59, and directly compare two different methods of assaying internalisation. Cells were labelled at 4\u00b0C with the doubly labelled antibody and transferrin, and then warmed to 37\u00b0C for 90 s. Subsequently cells were treated with PI-PLC to cleave GPI-anchors, and then with MESNa. The SS-atto-488 signal co-localised completely with transferrin. Alexa-546, however, was seen in many punctate structures that lack transferrin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We interpret these data as strong evidence that the PI-PLC treatment did not remove all external GPI-anchored protein, while reduction with MESNa provided more stringent discrimination between internal and external pools of the antibody (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, endogenous CD59 is indeed internalised in transferrin-containing vesicles, and apparent internalisation in vesicles lacking transferrin may, at least under the conditions we have employed in this study, be an artifact due to incomplete removal of surface bound antibody."

We used overexpression of AP180-C to block formation of coated pits in a HeLa cell line stably expressing SNAP-CD59. In cells expressing AP180-C, endocytosis of SNAP-CD59 was blocked to the same extent as endocytosis of transferrin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Endocytosis of SNAP-CD59 was also blocked by moderate expression of dynamin-2-K44A (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). In cells expressing very high levels of the mutant dynamin, abundant macropinosomes could be detected, as well as smaller endocytic structures (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Damke et al., 1995</a>). These were clearly induced by high levels of dynamin-2-K44A (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore moderate dynamin-2-K4AA expression does block the physiological mechanism that leads to internalisation of CD59 in unperturbed cells. As loss of both clathrin and dynamin function blocks uptake of CD59, the data imply that GPI-anchored proteins are likely to enter cells predominantly via clathrin-coated vesicles."

In the case of flotillin 1, although some plausible co-localisation could be observed in confocal images, quantification revealed that this may arise purely by chance as the same degree of pixel overlap was found in offset and original images (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). In the case of GRAF1, internalised biotin was detected in GRAF1-GFP-positive puncta (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Quantification confirmed specific overlap between internalised biotin and GRAF1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). The fact that our previous data show that most internalised biotin/total protein co-localises with transferrin made the strong prediction that these GRAF1-positive endosomes should also contain transferrin. This was indeed the case (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). ARF6 showed a similar distribution to GRAF1, labelling transferrin-positive endosomes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). We conclude that GRAF1-GFP and ARF6-GFP are present on transferrin-positive endocytic vesicles likely to have arisen from budding of clathrin-coated pits from the plasma membrane, that flotillin 1 is not detected on early endosomes, and that caveolin 1 is present on a very small fraction of endosomes. All of these observations are consistent with our general conclusion, that at least 95% of endocytosed protein enters the cell via clathrin-coated pits."

There are several factors potentially involved in this effect, such as rates of synthesis, degradation and endocytic recycling of proteins with GPI anchors. We investigated further the factor most relevant to the focus of this study, sorting during endocytosis. The absence of a cytosolic domain means that GPI-anchored proteins are fundamentally different from high-affinity cargoes such as the transferrin receptor, as they can not be recruited to the nascent pit via direct recognition of endocytic sorting motifs by adaptor proteins. It is likely that GPI-anchored proteins are partially excluded from coated pits by steric crowding effects (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bhagatji et al., 2009</a>). We reasoned that perturbing the recognition of endocytic sorting motifs could therefore cause differential effects on uptake of GPI-anchored proteins and transferrin receptor. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we used siRNA to partially reduce AP2 expression. AP2 recognises two major endocytic motifs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Edeling et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Motley et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kelly et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</a>). We measured transferrin and SNAP-CD59 uptake by flow cytometry, 3 days after siRNA transfection. Cells still endocytosed significant amounts of both cargoes (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We compared the ratio between the two cargoes, on a cell by cell basis, for the populations of control and AP2 siRNA transfected cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). AP2 siRNA caused a more pronounced reduction of transferrin than CD59 uptake. Confocal imaging confirmed the flow cytometry results. In cells where AP2 levels were reduced, the reduction in transferrin uptake appeared more severe than reduction in SNAP-CD59 uptake (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Using these imaging data, we correlated the amount of AP2 remaining in each cell with the total fluorescence intensity of internalised transferrin and SNAP-CD59 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). The uptake of both cargoes was efficiently blocked when AP2 levels became close to zero, but transferrin uptake was clearly more sensitive to reduction of AP2 levels than uptake of SNAP-CD59.

Overexpression of this mutant form of \u03bc2 for 4 days resulted in incorporation into endogenous AP2 complexes, and thereby provided a tool to further investigate sorting of transferrin and GPI-anchored proteins into coated pits (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Overexpression of \u00b52(F174S/D176A), but not wild-type \u03bc2, caused a dramatic differential effect on the uptake of the two cargoes after 90 s of labelling and internalisation. As predicted, transferrin uptake was reduced (<a href=\"#bib33\">Honing et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">Motley et al., 2006</a>). Uptake of SNAP-CD59, however, was significantly increased (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Importantly, this divergence did not arise from separate endocytic structures, as internalised SNAP-CD59 still co-localised well with the residual internalised transferrin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Moreover, when 3D object-based analysis was used to identify transferrin-positive vesicles, and to quantify the amount of SNAP-CD59 present in these vesicles, a clear increase in the SNAP-CD59 load in mutant-expressing cells was observed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). This analysis also confirmed the reduced transferrin load in endocytic vesicles in mutant-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). These results are in agreement with our initial hypothesis of distinctive sorting of GPI-anchored proteins into clathrin coated pits. They argue that steric exclusion of GPI-anchored proteins from the nascent pit becomes less acute when recruitment of high-affinity cargoes by AP2, or potentially other adaptors is abolished (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bhagatji et al., 2009</a>). More generally, the data imply that rates of endocytosis of high affinity cargoes may be more susceptible to a range of perturbations of coated pit function than cargoes like GPI-anchored proteins, which have a lower affinity for the nascent pit."

The use of small, monovalent reducible chemical labels provides high temporal resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and efficiency of topological discrimination between intracellular and extracellular protein. This has allowed us to follow endocytosis of effectively all proteins, and thereby to observe all endocytic intermediates formed by the cell at specific time-points, starting with as little as 20 s of internalisation. Our results are at some variance with previous studies from our own and other laboratories, and with our preconceptions before being confronted with the data (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hansen and Nichols, 2009</a>)."

Other mechanisms are not likely to make a significant contribution. Primary endocytic vesicles involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis should not contain significant amounts of transferrin receptor, and while we can detect a class of such vesicles they account for less than 5% of total endocytosis. Further data, including perturbations of clathrin-coated pit function, assay of the endocytosis of GPI-anchored proteins, and co-localisation experiments looking at candidate markers for clathrin-independent endocytic pathways are all consistent with this conclusion. A recent systematic analysis of multiple assays for endocytosis using siRNA screens also provides indirect support, in that it reveals extensive functional and regulatory links between uptake of cargoes previously thought to enter the cell via different mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib47\">Liberali et al., 2014</a>). In addition, this study conspicuously does not detect new linked sets of proteins likely to act together in a concerted fashion to make novel types of endocytic vesicle. Some cargoes for clathrin coated pits have been reported to be present in sub-populations of early endocytic vesicles, most likely through mechanisms related to cargo-dependent recruitment of specific adaptors (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lakadamyali et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Mettlen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Henry et al., 2012</a>). However, there is good evidence that transferrin receptor does not behave in this way (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lakadamyali et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</a>), and our analysis of transferrin load in primary endocytic vesicles confirms this. In the light of these observations, it is difficult to reconcile our data with reports of abundant clathrin-independent endocytic carriers or CLICs. We note that the ultrastructure of CLICs, although clearly different from clathrin-generated vesicles, is not dissimilar to that of the early endosomes that receive cargoes taken up via coated pits (<a href=\"#bib30\">Harding et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Willingham et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gruenberg et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hansen et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Ullrich et al., 1996</a>)."

                        "text": "Much of the literature on clathrin-independent endocytosis is based on perturbations with differential effects on the uptake of transferrin and putative clathrin-independent cargoes (<a href=\"#bib64\">Puri et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sabharanjak et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sandvig et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Doherty and McMahon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hansen and Nichols, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lakshminarayan et al., 2014</a>). Our data suggest a possible re-interpretation of this type of experiment. We demonstrate that GPI-anchored proteins enter mammalian cells via clathrin coated pits, and that this is fully compatible with the differential effects on endocytic uptake between transferrin receptor and GPI-anchored proteins reported here and observed in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib58\">Nichols et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sabharanjak et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Naslavsky et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kumari and Mayor, 2008</a>). The coated pit is a crowded environment, and GPI-anchored proteins will have to compete for a place inside the nascent pit with cargo proteins possessing high affinity sorting signals recognised directly by adaptor proteins (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</a>). When the protein levels of adaptors such as AP2 are reduced, or when the ability to bind and recruit certain cargoes is lost, it is likely that the pit becomes less crowded, thereby becomes more populated with low affinity or passive cargoes like GPI-anchored proteins, and yet retains some ability to bud. This leads to the differential effects on transferrin and CD59 uptake that we observed experimentally. Divergent effects of coated pit perturbation on cargoes which all demonstrably enter the cell via coated pits, means that such effects need no longer be interpreted as evidence for clathrin-independent endocytosis."

Additional endocytic mechanisms, like the still poorly understood set of protein machinery responsible for macropinocytosis, and the budding of caveolae, contribute very little to total protein uptake but can be detected by our assays.

Nevertheless, we conclude that clathrin-independent pathways do not make a significant contribution to total endocytic flux in cultured cells."

Quantification of co-localisation is explained in <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, and the relevant legend. In brief, one channel of a 2-colour image was converted into a binary mask that could be used to isolate those pixels from the second channel that are positive in the mask. Quantification of mean fluorescence intensity was carried out by simply drawing cell outlines as regions of interest in Image J. Importantly, empirically determined background from negative control experiments in which cells were incubated with labels only at 4\u00b0C was subtracted from all values. As there is inherent variability in both signal and background from cell to cell, this resulted in negative values in some instances."

The Introduction section frames the problem beautifully. After settling on reducible surface biotinylation for a labeling procedure, it was confirmed that this tags bulk surface constituents. Individual cargo at the surface could be followed using a reducible fluorescent ligand for the SNAP tag. Using this approach, &gt;95% of internalized biotinylated proteins colocalized with endocytosed transferrin (Tf) after 1-2 min at 37\u00b0C. A pulse of NHS-SS-biotin at 37\u00b0C for \u223c1-2 min together with Tf also produced a high degree of overlap between Tf and streptavidin signals. The remainder of the manuscript reinforces this principal finding. The authors conclude that clathrin-mediated endocytosis represents the major route for internalization for the plasma membrane and that cargo packaging is subject to steric competition."

The results from two papers in particular (Kirkham et al, 2005 (ref 17); Howes et al, 2010, which is not, but should be cited) need to be reconciled with the current findings. In these studies Parton and colleagues use quantitative electron microscopy studies with DAB reactions and surface quenching with ascorbic acid to also look at very early endocytic intermediates and identify CLIC, which have distinct morphologies and lack Tfn. Their morphometric analysis suggests that they account for the majority of bulk uptake in the cells they examined. We see two possibilities for reconciling these results:"

CME is a concentrative uptake mechanism so that B-cargo and Tfn will be \u223c20-fold more concentrated in nascent CCV derived vesicles as compared to bulk PM proteins in CLIC. While the data in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1B</a> appears to argue that even vesicles with very low levels of streptavidin contain Tfn it would be important somehow ensure that diffraction limited vesicles with the same label intensity as what would be expected for bulk membrane also are enriched in Tfn. That is there should be 20-fold more Tfn than bulk membrane in these nascent vesicles. Could this be done with a bulk membrane marker such as an FM143 dye? The GPI-probes should show a &gt;20:1 enrichment of Tfn vs GPI. Do these intensity differences match these expectations or are the authors unable to detect poorly labeled nascent CLICs?"

This compensatory, clathrin-independent endocytosis occurred through nascent vesicles smaller than CCVs as judged by HRP uptake and EM studies. Liu et al., 2008 showed that dynamin-2 null cells continue to take up cholera toxin and Bodipy-LacSer even though transferrin uptake and macropinocytosis were inhibited. Can the authors show induction of clathrin-independent pathways other than macropinocytosis? Please discuss."

The protein H/L ratios of the green-labeled GPI-anchored proteins in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> shows that these biotinylated forms of GPI-anchored proteins are clearly lower on the surface of AP-2 knocked-down cells. However, does the manuscript\u2019s whole protein data set show whether GPI-anchored proteins accumulate inside the AP-2 siRNA cell population rather than being extensively degraded? The underlying mechanistic basis for the surface loss is not really commented on directly or rationalized. It seems to me that they should explain why this occurs. GPI-anchored proteins do recycle back to the surface more slowly, but published data indicate this is due to interaction with cholesterol in the endosomal compartment. After several days, AP-2 knocked-down cells should be relatively cholesterol deficient due to LDL receptor accumulation on the cell surface and extremely limited endocytic flow.

In this context it is important to emphasise that, as shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>, there is no correlation between the biotin intensity of a vesicle and the probability that we fail to detect transferrin in it; it is not the case that low biotin intensity vesicles close to the detection threshold are significantly less likely to contain transferrin than higher biotin intensity vesicles. Additionally, macropinosomes (which are likely to have a similar membrane protein composition to the plasma membrane) are readily detected using our approach, as are small and scarce caveolar vesicles (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

We have looked at RPE cells, which spontaneously migrate in culture, and did not see evidence for this (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 5</a>). Another possibility is that many structures identified by ultrastructure as CLICs may, in fact, be transferrin-positive early endosomes. The various EM studies on the morphology of early endosomes under different conditions yield examples of early endosome structures that look like CLICs, but contain transferrin or other clathrin cargoes (compare [2]-Figure 4A, with [3]-Figure 6F, [4]-Figure 1, [5]-Figure 9, [6]-Figures 8,10, [7]-Figure 1 <i>etc</i>.). Therefore we suggest that it is hard to define CLICs by a specific morphology, and reliance on transferrin-HRP or CTB-HRP as markers means that simultaneous detection of both conventional early endosomes and potential CLICs in the same EM sections is difficult [2].

Given the complex mode of action of dynamin, interpretation of the effects of overexpression of the K44A mutant in terms of precise mechanisms is difficult [8]. The important finding from the point of view of our argument is that these structures are indeed clearly induced by the mutant, as demonstrated both by the image and by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). We have amended the text accordingly. The finding that dynamin 2 K44A induces endocytic events that usually do not happen / are relatively infrequent highlights what we see as one of the main advantages of the approach used in our paper, namely analysis of the identity of endocytic carriers in unperturbed cells."

A full examination of these possibilities is clearly beyond the scope of the current manuscript.
