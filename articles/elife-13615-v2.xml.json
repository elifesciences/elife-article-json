                    "text": "In animal-based biomedical research, both the sex and the age of the animals studied affect disease phenotypes by modifying their susceptibility, presentation and response to treatment. The accurate reporting of experimental methods and materials, including the sex and age of animals, is essential so that other researchers can build on the results of such studies. Here we use text mining to study 15,311 research papers in which mice were the focus of the study. We find that the percentage of papers reporting the sex and age of mice has increased over the past two decades: however, only about 50% of the papers published in 2014 reported these two variables. We also compared the quality of reporting in six preclinical research areas and found evidence for different levels of sex-bias in these areas: the strongest male-bias was observed in cardiovascular disease models and the strongest female-bias was found in infectious disease models. These results demonstrate the ability of text mining to contribute to the ongoing debate about the reproducibility of research, and confirm the need to continue efforts to improve the reporting of experimental methods and materials."

The accurate reporting of experimental methods and materials, including the sex and age of animals, is essential so that other researchers can build on the results of such studies. Here we use text mining to study 15,311 research papers in which mice were the focus of the study. We find that the percentage of papers reporting the sex and age of mice has increased over the past two decades: however, only about 50% of the papers published in 2014 reported these two variables. We also compared the quality of reporting in six preclinical research areas and found evidence for different levels of sex-bias in these areas: the strongest male-bias was observed in cardiovascular disease models and the strongest female-bias was found in infectious disease models. These results demonstrate the ability of text mining to contribute to the ongoing debate about the reproducibility of research, and confirm the need to continue efforts to improve the reporting of experimental methods and materials."

One factor contributing to this observed lack of reproducibility may be inadequate reporting of experimental methods and materials (<a href=\"#bib29\">Landis et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Moher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">van der Worp and Macleod, 2011</a>).

In experiments using animals, for instance, the sex and age of the mice should be reported because they affect morphological, physiological, immunological and behavioral parameters and, hence, they influence the outcomes of experiments (<a href=\"#bib17\">Diedrich et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wizemann and Pardue, 2001</a>). Sex and age are inextricably linked: it has been proposed that under natural conditions sexual selection has profound effects on the lifespan of organisms (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bale and Epperson, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Maklakov and Lummaa, 2013</a>). Considering some taxa exceptions, the general conclusion is that in many animals (including humans), males have shorter lifespans than females (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clutton-Brock and Isvaran, 2007</a>). Furthermore, from an evolutionary standpoint, these sex differences in lifespan depends to a great extent on sexually dimorphic life-history strategies (such as mating systems; <a href=\"#bib32\">Maklakov and Lummaa, 2013</a>), and on genetic architecture, including both the sex chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nguyen and Disteche, 2006</a>) and the mitochondrial DNA (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gemmell et al., 2004</a>)."

Some pathologies exhibit a clear sexual dimorphism (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ober et al., 2008</a>). Using stroke as an example, it is known that its incidence is higher in men than women during their lifespan (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mozaffarian et al., 2015</a>). However, recent evidence suggests that after the age of 60 years and thus post-menopause, women have more severe strokes than men (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dehlendorff et al., 2015</a>). In the case of animal models, sex- and age-dependent differences in protein expression profiles were observed in the heart proteome of female and male C57BL/6 mice of two distinct age groups (14 and 100 weeks) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Diedrich et al., 2007</a>). This evidence implies that sex differences must be studied across the entire lifespan in order to bring new insights into the pathogenesis of the diseases and identify targets for new drugs for both sexes and different times of life."

We investigate questions of whether the sex and age of mice are reported, the use of animals of each sex in six different areas of preclinical research, and the use of animals of each sex in four subgroups (genetics, immunology, physiopathology and therapy) for these six areas."

Researchers rely on mouse models to mimic human disease conditions for several reasons. One of the main reasons is that mouse and human genomes are genetically similar \u2013 about 90% of human genes have direct orthologues with mice (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yue et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, as animal models, mice are convenient due to their small size, short lifespan (up to two years), and quick generation time; three weeks for gestation and from 6 to 8 weeks to reach sexual maturity. Therefore, they can be easily housed and maintained, can be genetically manipulated to define gene function in a whole body system and a large number of mice can be studied in a relatively short period of time. This, for instance, allows scientists to study cell/cell interactions in the tissue environment and thus cause and effect relationships in a controlled situation."

In agreement with previous reports, the evidence presented in this study showed that the lack of reporting of key methodological parameters in mouse experiments is still a cause of concern; only about half of the papers published in 2014 stated both sex and age of the mice as experimental variables (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). The reason why these variables are not described is unclear, since this simple information is always available to researchers. We do not believe it is a space issue, because it is possible to describe them, including mice number and mouse strain, in about 40 characters of text (<i>e.g.</i> ten C57BL/6 female mice (6-8-weeks old)). Whilst an improvement in the reporting of mouse sex and age has been observed over time, this is not solely attributable to the introduction of journal guidelines, because this improvement started before the publication of the ARRIVE guidelines in 2010 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kilkenny et al., 2010</a>). In fact, a follow-up study in 2012 showed that while sex and age reporting had improved post-ARRIVE, journals that enforced the ARRIVE guidelines as a condition of publication still failed to publish sex and age in all cases (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baker et al., 2014</a>). The observed improvements may also therefore be a result of a growing recognition of the importance of sex and age as experimental factors that may affect study outcomes."

This conclusion is based mainly on the results of two studies that manually surveyed a set of biomedical articles (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beery and Zucker, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Taylor et al., 2011</a>). However, our results showed otherwise in mouse-based models: 31.84% and 23.38% of all papers assessed were on studies performed on female and male mice, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). This could be explained by some practical advantages of using female rather than male mice: they are cheaper to house; they are less aggressive to each other and to experimenters; and they are smaller, requiring less weight-administered drug. In addition, the apparent contradiction between this observation and the previous reports might be related to the sample size and study design; our sample size was larger and we surveyed a much broader range of disciplines. In addition, although rodent models (that is, mouse and rat models) accounted for, respectively, 50% and 80% of the papers considered in these other studies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beery and Zucker, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Taylor et al., 2011</a>), they also included other species, such as cat, dog and monkey models: moreover, these two studies did not explore sex bias by species."

Among the main preclinical research topics assessed, we observed the strongest male-bias in cardiovascular disease models (2.25:1) and the strongest female-bias in infectious disease models (3.54:1) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). This situation still persists: between 2012 and 2014, about 70% and 77% of research articles assessed on these two disease models are still biased towards male and female mice, respectively. These pathologies and many others, exhibit important sexual dimorphisms, which are not only inherent to genetic differences, but also to hormonal influence (<a href=\"#bib10\">Case et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gilks et al., 2014</a>). For example, in the study of hypertension, one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, a greater increase in blood pressure was reported in gonad-intact XY males than XX females using the four core genotype in the MF1 mouse model. However, the mean arterial pressure was greater in gonadectomized XX mice compared with XY mice regardless of whether the mice were born with testes or with ovaries (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ji et al., 2010</a>). On the other hand, in the case of infectious diseases, females have a more robust immune system than males \u2013 both the innate and adaptive immune responses, which makes them less susceptible to developing many infections (mainly Th1-type infections), although it increases the risk of developing autoimmune diseases due to their trend to develop a stronger pro-inflammatory response (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pennell et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, we also observed that the sex-bias could change in a particular disease mouse model according to the biomedical study. Diabetes disease mouse models exemplified this situation. From a global point of view, this disease was found to be male-biased (1.57:1) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). However, in studies related with the immunology of diabetes, there was a strong female-bias (7.87:1) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>); a change that remains in the study of diabetes mellitus type 2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Regarding this initiative, new ideas have been proposed to achieve, and sustain, the sex balance in biomedical research (<a href=\"#bib33\">McCullough et al., 2014</a>). In this context, our study provides an implementation of text mining to assess reporting of experimental factors. By knowing where there is imbalance for a particular variable, it is possible to address it in a cost-effective manner. This not only directly contributes to the comparability of experimental work, but also to the reproducibility of findings. To address this problem some journals are already introducing editorial measures and methods checklists in order to improve the quality of scientific reporting (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nature, 2013</a>). Nevertheless, whilst journal checklists may make reference to species strain, sex and age of animals, the main focus is on statistical issues to ensure repeatability, rather than biological factors that modify the outcomes."

The six disease groups were as follows: cardiovascular diseases; cancer; diabetes mellitus; lung diseases; infectious diseases; and neurological disorders. Some causes of death did not apply for our study, <i>e.g.</i> road injury. HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other infections, for instance, were included in the infectious diseases group. A group for cancer was created in a similar way. An example disease for each of the six disease groups was also included. In addition, as there are different approaches to assess disease models according to the research field, <i>e.g.</i> immunology, genetics etc., each of these areas were divided into a series of subgroups by using the Subheading MeSH terms \u201cgenetics\u201d, \u201cimmunology\u201d, \u201cphysiopathology\u201d and \u201ctherapy\u201d (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>).

The precision (P), calculated as TP/(TP+FP), determines the accuracy of the system in recognizing desirable terms. The recall (R), calculated as TP/(TP+FN), produces the coverage of the system. Often, there is an inverse relationship between precision and recall; when an increase occurs in precision, a simultaneous decrease is observed in recall and vice versa.

False-negative results regarding age mentions occurred because the rules are based on syntactical patterns that require a numeric range between specific time units, <i>i.e.</i>, days, weeks and months. For example, in the sentence <i>\u201cNineteen animals, including males and females, of ages from postnatal day (P) 7 to several months were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane and decapitated\u201d</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arbogast et al., 2013</a>), age is not mentioned as a range concept of days (or weeks or months) but as <i>\u201cpostnatal days to several months\u201d</i> without indicating the exact number of months. Cases like this suggest that an extension of the current rule set could lead to an improvement towards the system\u2019s performance. False-negative results regarding sex mentions occurred because the rules for the sex recognition is rather straightforward with a simple dictionary matching (minimal), which, as a consequence, does not enable the identification of the sex through inference, <i>e.g.</i> when sex-specific proxy elements are mentioned, such as pregnancy. For example, in the sentence <i>\u201cPrimary mouse mammary epithelial (PMME) cells were isolated from 15-d timed-pregnant CD-1 mice\u201d</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lin et al., 1995</a>) are expected to be missed since the sex of the mice used in this experiment is female and is being inferred by the word <i>\u201cpregnant\u201d</i>."

This is because the system identified words like <i>\u201cmale\u201d</i> or <i>\u201cfemale\u201d</i> early in text, whereas in the actual experiment the scientists did not report any specific sex for the selected model. For example, in the sentence <i>\u201cThe colony of animals carrying the Pak1ip1mray allele is maintained by crossing male carriers with FVB/NJ females. All embryos presented in the phenotypic analysis of this study were produced from carriers crossed for at least four generations onto an FVB/NJ background\u201d</i> (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ross et al., 2013</a>), the sex of the embryos was not established even though the findings relied on them. Other cases were: <i>\u201cEpithelial cells were derived from tracheas of 3-weeks old Gprc5a mice\u201d</i> and <i>\u201cby peritoneal into 8\u201312 weeks old C56Bl/6 mice\u201d</i>. Cases like these suggest that the implementation of a more sophisticated system that could target common syntactical patterns observed in text (similar to those for the characteristic of age) will contribute to an improvement of the precision and performance of the system. This could explain why sex had the lower precision (90.6%) of the two analyzed factors (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). On the contrary, there was only one false positive (referring to the embryonic stage of the mice) although the real age could not be recognized directly due to not being explicitly expressed; <i>\u201cGenomic DNA and pooled total RNAs were isolated from CRL2196 cells and from various tissues, ages and lineages of mice as indicated, using standard methods and Trizol (Invitrogen), respectively\u201d</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2014</a>).

There is room to improve the applied text mining strategy. Crafting more flexible rules for the capture of age and including more specific ones for the recognition of sex could improve the generated results and reveal a clearer picture of the reporting of these variables in the biomedical field. While the variety of the observed common lexical patterns was not wide in the training and development sets (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary files 2A and 2C</a>), a larger set could reveal other patterns that could help increase the recall.

The authors find while there is general improvement in reporting these variables, about half of the papers published in 2014 still lack these variables. An interesting gender-bias is noted in different fields of study."
