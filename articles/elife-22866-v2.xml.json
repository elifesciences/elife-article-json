Here, we describe a new approach to investigate these neural circuits in mouse. This semi-intact somatosensory preparation enables recording from spinal output neurons, while precisely controlling somatosensory input, and simultaneously manipulating specific populations of spinal interneurons. Our findings suggest that spinal interneurons show distinct temporal and spatial tuning properties. We also show that modality selectivity \u2014 mechanical, heat and cold \u2014 can be assessed in both retrogradely labeled spinoparabrachial projection neurons and genetically labeled spinal interneurons. Finally, we demonstrate that interneuron connectivity can be determined via optogenetic activation of specific interneuron subtypes. This new approach may facilitate key conceptual advances in our understanding of the spinal somatosensory circuits in health and disease."

Here, we describe a new approach to investigate these neural circuits in mouse. This semi-intact somatosensory preparation enables recording from spinal output neurons, while precisely controlling somatosensory input, and simultaneously manipulating specific populations of spinal interneurons. Our findings suggest that spinal interneurons show distinct temporal and spatial tuning properties. We also show that modality selectivity \u2014 mechanical, heat and cold \u2014 can be assessed in both retrogradely labeled spinoparabrachial projection neurons and genetically labeled spinal interneurons. Finally, we demonstrate that interneuron connectivity can be determined via optogenetic activation of specific interneuron subtypes. This new approach may facilitate key conceptual advances in our understanding of the spinal somatosensory circuits in health and disease."

Under some circumstances, these neural circuits reduce the degree to which noxious input is conveyed to the brain (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gebhart, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Moayedi and Davis, 2013</a>). In others, the somatosensory input is amplified by spinal circuits, leading to allodynia and hyperalgesia, two hallmarks of chronic pain (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sandk\u00fchler, 2009</a>). Given the central role of the spinal dorsal horn in the modulation of noxious input, there is a great need for an improved understanding of the underlying spinal microcircuits and the computations they perform."

Historically, such studies were performed using in vivo recordings (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carstens, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Craig et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dickenson and Sullivan, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jinks and Carstens, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Koerber et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Randic et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Torsney and Fitzgerald, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Urch and Dickenson, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>). However, a considerable limitation to this approach is that it is difficult to target known cell types in the dorsal horn. With the advent of a new generation of molecular genetic tools, it has been possible to overcome this constraint by recording from genetically defined subsets of neurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bourane et al., 2015a</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Duan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hantman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Heinke et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kardon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Peirs et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Petitjean et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zeilhofer et al., 2005</a>). Generally, though, these experiments have been performed within the context of a spinal slice, which suffers from the shortcoming that key components of the nociceptive circuit, such as the input, are severed. In this context, spinal circuits are evaluated using electrical stimulation of the whole dorsal roots, even though such a stimulus is not physiological. These issues underscored the need for an electrophysiological approach that allows visual access for targeted recordings, and includes innervated skin for natural stimulation."

Next, we analyze modality selectivity of lamina I spinoparabrachial (SPB) projection neurons and genetically labeled spinal interneurons. Finally, we investigated the feasibility of optogenetic manipulation in the dorsal horn, and use this approach to begin mapping spinal circuitry.

Previously, we developed an ex vivo preparation to record from primary afferents while providing natural stimulation to the skin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baumbauer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jankowski et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lawson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McIlwrath et al., 2007</a>). Here, we extended the use of this preparation by recording from neurons in the superficial dorsal horn rather than the dorsal root ganglia. This preparation comprises of a large portion of spinal cord (~C2 \u2013 S3), together with lumbar 2 (L2) and L3 roots, ganglia, saphenous nerve and hindlimb skin (including hindpaw), dissected in continuum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>). Spinal segments L2 and L3, which are targeted by the saphenous nerve, are regions of the spinal cord that are well-suited for visually-guided whole cell recordings because they contain regions of grey matter that are clearly visible between gaps in the roots (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, dotted ovals). In particular, the lateral aspect of the dorsal horn is favorable because the white matter in this region is very thin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, green shaded area). For optimal stimulation of the skin, we created a custom recording chamber in which the skin rests on a perforated platform at the air-liquid interface, allowing the dermis to be bathed with oxygenated aCSF, while the stratum corneum is exposed and thus accessible to mechanical and thermal stimuli (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In addition, to accommodate pharmacological studies, we also designed an alternative, small volume chamber with directed flow optimized for drug application (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B)</a>. The final challenge was to visualize spinal neurons for recordings. To this end, we employed side illumination with a high-powered infrared light emitting diode, which allowed visualization and patch-clamp recording of cells up to 50 \u00b5m from the surface of the spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib49\">Safronov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Szucs et al., 2009</a>)."

We therefore sought to determine the feasibility of recording from known cell types. Spinal projection neurons were of particular interest to us, since they are the output neurons that convey nociceptive information to the brain. However, while many spinal projection neurons are located in lamina I, they can be difficult to target since they are quite sparse, representing only 5% of total neurons in this lamina (<a href=\"#bib53\">Todd, 2010</a>). Previous work in rat has revealed that most anterolateral tract projection neurons send their axons to the lateral parabrachial nucleus in the brainstem (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Khater and Todd, 2009</a>). We therefore injected DiI into this nucleus to retrogradely label neurons SPB projection neurons, which were readily identified four days later and targeted for whole cell patch clamp recordings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Next, we characterized the modality selectivity by assessing the response to mechanical force (M; 1 g von Frey filament), heat (H; 50\u00b0C saline), and cold (C; 0\u00b0C saline) stimuli. These experiments revealed the existence of several discrete functional classes of SPB projection neurons. Half of these neurons were considered to be polymodal because action potentials were evoked in response to both mechanical and thermal stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B, C and F</a>).

Recently, several Cre and/or Flp alleles have been used to target genetically defined populations of spinal interneurons and investigate their role through loss- or gain-of-function approaches in vivo (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bourane et al., 2015a</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Duan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Peirs et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Petitjean et al., 2015</a>). Less is known, however, about the specific functions of these cells within the context of a spinal microcircuit. We therefore investigated whether the semi-intact somatosensory preparation could be used to record from genetically defined interneurons and characterize their modality tuning. Because the genetically-labeled cells were located throughout the dorsal horn, this also gave us the opportunity to determine the depth from which we could record fluorescent cells in our preparation."

We also showed previously, using slice recordings, that <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> neurons receive direct input from primary afferents that respond to capsaicin, mustard oil, and menthol, raising the possibility that some <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> neurons might mediate the inhibition of itch by counter-stimuli (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kardon et al., 2014</a>).

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on tdTomato-labeled neurons in the superficial dorsal horn, and the fluorescent dye Alexa 647 was added to the patch pipette to ensure correct targeting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Next, we investigated which types of sensory input (mechanical, cold and/or heat) evoked action potentials in these cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

Thus, whereas our previous slice recordings had revealed that <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> cells receive direct input from afferents that respond to counter-stimuli (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kardon et al., 2014</a>), the ex vivo recordings presented here show, for the first time, that <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> neurons fire action potentials in response to three types of counter-stimuli, heat, cold and mechanical force. Interestingly, we observed that cutaneous stimulation evokes not only EPSCs (data not shown) but also IPSCs in <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), suggesting that feed-forward inhibition may gate the responses of <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> neurons following stimulation of the skin. These data show that it is not only feasible to record from genetically labeled neurons in the semi-intact somatosensory preparation, but that it is possible to characterize their stimulus response properties. Moreover, we could target these brightly fluorescent cells as long as they were within 70 \u00b5m from the surface of the spinal cord, suggesting it is possible to study interneurons that reside from lamina I through to the outer part of lamina III."

One approach to increase the precision of genetic targeting is through the use of tamoxifen-inducible alleles, which adds specificity through temporal control of recombination. To test the use of optogenetics in this context, we used mice harboring the <i>Nos1-CreER</i> allele, which causes recombination selectively in Nos1-expressing neurons (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). For these experiments, mice were treated with tamoxifen at P14 and recordings were performed three weeks later. As before, blue light induced inward current in ChR2-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>); however, the magnitude of the current was significantly lower than that observed using either <i>Nts-Cre</i> or <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> alleles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Given that Nos1 neurons make up a large fraction of those marked by the <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> allele, it seemed unlikely that this disparity in current was due to a difference in cell type. Rather, we hypothesized that the reduced current in <i>Nos1-CreER</i> cells was due to the timing of Cre-mediated recombination, which occurred only upon tamoxifen-treatment, hence allowing less time for ChR2 accumulation. Consistent with this, we found that if we reduced the time post tamoxifen (i.e., one week rather than three), the amplitude of blue light-evoked current was smaller still, and insufficient to trigger an action potential in ChR2-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C,D and E</a>). Thus, when using the Ai32 allele, it appears that approximately three weeks\u2019 time post-recombination is required to reach functional levels of ChR2 expression in the dorsal horn."

Moreover, when similar experiments were performed in ChR2-expressing <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> neurons, these cells showed even worse fidelity to optogenetic stimulation, and many showed a reluctance to fire even when we increased the stimulus duration (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure\u00a05\u2014figure supplement 1F and G</a>). These data reveal that, while ChR2 can be used in our somatosensory preparation to manipulate the activity of genetically defined cells, the effects of optogenetic stimulation in a given cell type must be determined empirically."

For these experiments, we used mice harboring either <i>Nts-Cre</i> together with Ai35 (for Cre-dependent Arch) or <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> together with Ai39 (for Cre-dependent Halo). Expression of either Arch or Halo in dorsal horn neurons enabled light-induced outward current (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A, B and C</a>) and hyperpolarization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D, E and F</a>) that was not significantly different between <i>Nts-Cre</i> and <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> populations. To determine whether the expression of these opsins was sufficient to block evoked activity, we analyzed the effect of light on activity evoked by electrical stimulation of the dorsal root. In <i>Nts-Cre</i> neurons expressing Arch, optogenetic stimulation almost completely blocked root-evoked action potentials (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D and G</a>). In contrast, while the number of root-evoked action potentials was significantly reduced by optogenetic inhibition of <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> neurons expressing Halo, they were not completely eliminated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E and G</a>). Given the similarity in outward current and hyperpolarization elicited by the two inhibitory opsins, the disparity in their effectiveness is likely due, at least in part, to differences between the two types of recorded cells, potentially including distinct intrinsic properties and/or differences in root-evoked input. Thus, these findings illustrate that inhibitory opsins can be used in a variety of cell types in the dorsal horn to manipulate cell activity while underscoring the important concept that their effects are context-dependent."

However, the specific role of <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> neurons within the context of a spinal microcircuit was unclear. To investigate this question further, we analyzed the effect of optogenetic activation of <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> neurons on lamina I neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Specifically, we searched for lamina I neurons that received direct input from <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), which was deemed to be monosynaptic inhibitory input due to the short latency and absence of jitter in the evoked IPSC (data not shown). Next, we analyzed the effect of activating <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> neurons with optogenetics. In the absence of light, dorsal root stimulation resulted in two phases of EPSCs, likely due to the inputs to this cell from primary afferents with different conduction velocities, and each of these phases was associated with the generation of an action potential in current clamp (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>; black traces). Stimulation of the dorsal root in conjunction with light activation of <i>Bhlhe22-Cre</i> neurons resulted in similar EPSCs. However, these EPSCs were no longer associated with the generation of action potentials (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>; red traces).

We therefore investigated whether we could map the connectivity of interneurons onto functionally characterized spinal projection neurons. As proof-of-principle, we selected the <i>Nts-Cre</i> allele because it is expressed in approximately half of excitatory dorsal horn interneurons. First, DiI-labeled lamina I projection neurons were characterized based on their responses to mechanical, heat and cold stimuli applied to their receptive fields (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Then, optogenetic experiments were performed to determine whether the recorded cell received monosynaptic input form <i>Nts-Cre</i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Of six projection neurons that were functionally characterized, only four received monosynaptic input from <i>Nts-Cre</i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). However, in this small set of characterized cells we found no evidence that <i>Nts-Cre</i> neurons selectively target projection neurons that are tuned to a specific stimulus modality, which may not be surprising given that <i>Nts-Cre</i> cells are likely a heterogeneous population. Nevertheless, this experiment illustrates the use of the semi-intact somatosensory preparation together with optogenetic approaches to characterize interneuron input onto functionally characterized spinal projection neurons for the first time. With the use of more selective Cre lines, it seems likely that this approach will help uncover cell type specific connectivity among dorsal horn interneuron subtypes, though whether such connectivity will show modality selectivity remains an open question."

Inhibition is thought to be involved in limiting nociception, sharpening spatial acuity, and providing occlusion between somatosensory modalities, all of which become disrupted upon injury (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lewin et al., 1994</a>).

Understanding the logic of spinal projection neurons that convey noxious information to the brain is a central question in the field that remains unaddressed. In particular, the number of different subtypes of spinal projection neurons is unknown, and how they encode somatosensory information is unclear. For our study, we used a common classification scheme based on three psychophysically distinct modalities, force, heat and cool. A secondary way to classify mechanically sensitive projection neurons is based on the intensity of stimulation to which they respond: nociceptive neurons respond only when mechanical stimulation is noxious, whereas wide dynamic range neurons respond in a graded manner (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dado et al., 1994</a>). Most recently, several investigators have begun to subdivide chemically responsive projection neurons based on their responses to chemical algogens and pruritogens (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andrew and Craig, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carstens, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Davidson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jinks and Carstens, 1999</a>). While these efforts illustrate that different projection neurons are tuned to different types of somatosensory input in complex ways, projection neuron subtypes <i>per se</i> have remained generally elusive.

Could the afterdischarge that we observed in a subset of lamina I neurons occur as a result of tissue damage? While this possibility cannot be excluded at the present time, we think it is unlikely for two reasons. First, afterdischarge is not simply due to injury of primary afferents that could potentially occur while dissecting the skin, since this phenomenon is not observed when we record from DRG neurons in our semi-intact preparation (unpublished observations). Moreover, afterdischarge is also observed in na\u00efve rats upon recording from superficial dorsal horn neurons in vivo, where (just was we report here) 20% of dorsal horn neurons showed prolonged responses to a single stimulus (<a href=\"#bib57\">Woolf and Fitzgerald, 1983</a>)."

For this reason, we and others used a less stringent criterion (e.g., 0.1 Hz optogenetic stimulation) to differentiate between mono- and polysynaptic input in the dorsal horn (<a href=\"#bib24\">Honsek et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wang and Zylka, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2016</a>).

Two additional Cre alleles were used: <i>Nts-Cre</i>, a non-disruptive Cre recombinase knock-in at the endogenous <i>Neurotensin</i> locus (stock: 017525); <i>Nos1-CreER</i>, a disruptive Cre recombinase knockin to the endogenous neuronal nitric oxide synthase locus (stock: 014541). In addition, we used four Cre-dependent alleles targeted into the <i>Rosa</i> locus in which a loxP-flanked STOP cassette prevents CAG promoter-driven expression of reporter and/or effector proteins. These were: Ai9, enabling expression of tdTomato (<i>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm9(CAG-tdTomato)</sup></i>; stock: 007909); Ai32, enabling expression of an enhanced ChR2 fusion protein, ChR2(H134)/EYFP (<i>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm32(CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP)</sup></i>; stock: 012569); Ai35, enabling expression of an Arch-GFP fusion protein (<i>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm35.1(CAG-aop3/GFP)</sup></i>; stock: 012735); and Ai39, enabling expression of a Halo-GFP fusion protein (<i>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm39(CAG-hop/EYFP)</sup></i>; stock: 014539). Tamoxifen (Sigma,\u00a00.4 mg/kg; IP) was injected into mice harboring the <i>Nos1-CreER</i> allele at post-natal day 14 (P14), three weeks prior to electrophysiological experiments. Mice were given free access to food and water and housed under standard laboratory conditions. Wild type mice (C57BL/6) were purchased from Charles River\u00a0(Horsham,\u00a0PA). The use of animals was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh."

The animals were perfused transcardially through the left ventricle with ice-cold oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) sucrose-based artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (in mM; 234 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 Glucose). Immediately following perfusion, the skin was incised along the dorsal midline and the spinal cord was quickly exposed via dorsal laminectomy. After cord exposure, the right hindlimb and spinal cord (~C2 \u2013 S6) were excised, transferred into Sylgard-lined dissection/recording dish, and submerged in the same ice-cold sucrose-based ACSF, which circulated at 50 ml/min to facilitate superfusion of the cord. Note that this high flow rate did not impede stable recordings because of the chamber volume (20 ml) and architecture (in which the inlet is far from the recording site). Alternatively, a chamber with smaller volume and flow rate requirements can be used for pharmacological studies (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Next, the skin innervated by the saphenous nerve was dissected free of surrounding tissue (modification from <a href=\"#bib36\">McIlwrath et al., 2007</a>). L2 and L3 DRG were kept on the spine. Dural and pial membranes were carefully removed and spinal cord was pinned onto the Sylgard block with the right dorsal horn facing upward. Following dissection, the chamber was transferred to the rig. Then the preparation was perfused with normal ACSF solution (in mM; 117 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 glucose) saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 32\u00b0C. Tissue was rinsed with ACSF for at least 30 min to wash out sucrose. Thereafter, recordings can be performed for up to 6 hr post-dissection."

A narrow beam infrared LED (L850D-06 Marubeni, Tokyo,\u00a0Japan,\u00a0emission peak, 850 nm) was positioned outside the solution meniscus, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib49\">Safronov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Szucs et al., 2009</a>). Projection neurons in lamina I were identified by DiI fluorescence following injection into the parabrachial nucleus. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made with a pipette constructed from thin-walled single-filamented borosilicate glass using a microelectrode puller (P-97; Sutter Instruments,\u00a0Novato\u00a0CA, and PC-10; Narishige International, East Meadow NY). Pipette resistances ranged from six to 12 M\u03a9. Electrodes were filled with an intracellular solution containing the following (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 5 MgATP, pH 7.2. Alexa fluor 647 (Invitrogen; 25 \u00b5M) was added to confirm recording from the target cell. Signals were acquired with an amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Molecular Devices,\u00a0Sunnyvale\u00a0CA).

At present, we have very limited information about the responses of different classes of projection neuron or interneuron to natural stimuli, and about the synaptic circuits that these cells take part in. The recent identification of several neurochemically distinct interneuron populations, together with the availability of new mouse lines in which recombinases are expressed in these populations, means that we are now in a far better position to investigate the functional circuitry of pain and itch transmission at the spinal level. However, new techniques will be required for this opportunity to be fully exploited."

They also show that these techniques can be combined with retrograde labelling to identify projection neurons. Although each of these approaches has been applied to the dorsal horn, the combination is quite novel and provides an extremely powerful way of exploring the functions of different neuronal populations."

However, in this paper they have a tendency to assume that cells labelled with tdTomato in the <i>Bhlhb5-Cre;Ai9</i> cross are the same as the B5-I neurons (e.g. subsection \u201cRecording from genetically labeled neurons\u201d, last paragraph, subsection \u201cOptogenetic modulation of recorded neurons\u201d, second paragraph, and subsection \u201cCircuit mapping using optogenetics\u201d, first paragraph). This is not the case, firstly because some excitatory interneurons will be included, and secondly because there may be inhibitory interneurons that transiently express Bhlhb5, but are not dependent on it for their survival. It would be best to avoid using the term B5-I in this context. In order to restrict the targeted neurons to the B5-I population, they would need some kind of intersectional approach, and that is clearly beyond the scope of this paper."

The successful demonstration of the utility of this approach to study excitatory / inhibitory / subthreshold synaptic input and AP firing in retrograde/genetically defined subpopulations that is evoked by specific sensory modalities is a significant technical achievement and in my opinion would be highly appropriate as a 'tools and resources' article in the <i>eLife</i> journal. Furthermore, the authors investigated the use of optogenetic manipulation of particular interneuron subpopulations in this novel preparation as a potentially powerful means of dissecting spinal somatosensory wiring. My main concern with this manuscript is the lack of discussion regarding potential limitations of the preparation and using it in combination with optogenetics to define circuitry. The development of this preparation is commendable and I think that a more open discussion of the potential issues would be a positive asset to such a tools and resources article rather than detract from it."

Given the paper argues that these approaches will be used to unravel spinal circuitry it has to be acknowledged that, as detailed in the manuscript (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) this is only achievable within a restricted zone of L2/3 which is accessible for identified patch recording. Furthermore, this has potential implications, if they intend in the future to combine with pain models that classically impact upon L4/5 and affect hindpaw sensitivity."

To define direct/monosynaptic connections high frequency stimulation of inputs is used: monosynaptic/direct connections will be able to reliably follow with little jitter unlike polysynaptic connections which will be variable and or fail. Typically, 20Hz is used in intraspinal studies (with electrical stimulation) to test whether an input is monosynaptic. A prerequisite of this approach is that input must be capable of reliably delivering the repeated stimulus with no jitter. Here the authors demonstrate that with optogenetics this was not straightforward with differing degrees of success between different targeted subpopulations. Their best scenario was 0.1Hz stimulation in the Nts-cre cells (higher frequencies caused significant jitter) \u2013 which they then used to define direct connections. This lower stringency could result in false identification of direct monosynaptic connections \u2013 this is a caveat that must be discussed if the intention is to use this approach to identify wiring."

However, in this paper they have a tendency to assume that cells labelled with tdTomato in the Bhlhb5-Cre;Ai9 cross are the same as the B5-I neurons (e.g. subsection \u201cRecording from genetically labeled neurons\u201d, last paragraph, subsection \u201cOptogenetic modulation of recorded neurons\u201d, second paragraph, and subsection \u201cCircuit mapping using optogenetics\u201d, first paragraph). This is not the case, firstly because some excitatory interneurons will be included, and secondly because there may be inhibitory interneurons that transiently express Bhlhb5, but are not dependent on it for their survival. It would be best to avoid using the term B5-I in this context.

Typically, 20Hz is used in intraspinal studies (with electrical stimulation) to test whether an input is monosynaptic. A prerequisite of this approach is that input must be capable of reliably delivering the repeated stimulus with no jitter. Here the authors demonstrate that with optogenetics this was not straightforward with differing degrees of success between different targeted subpopulations. Their best scenario was 0.1Hz stimulation in the Nts-cre cells (higher frequencies caused significant jitter) \u2013 which they then used to define direct connections.
