Cdc42 and its effector Gic1 are involved in septin recruitment, ring formation and dissociation. The regulatory mechanisms behind these processes are not well understood. Here, we have used electron microscopy and cryo electron tomography to elucidate the structural basis of the Gic1-septin and Gic1-Cdc42-septin interaction. We show that Gic1 acts as a scaffolding protein for septin filaments forming long and flexible filament cables. Cdc42 in its GTP-form binds to Gic1, which ultimately leads to the dissociation of Gic1 from the filament cables. Surprisingly, Cdc42-GDP is not inactive, but in the absence of Gic1 directly interacts with septin filaments resulting in their disassembly. We suggest that this unanticipated dual function of Cdc42 is crucial for the cell cycle. Based on our results we propose a novel regulatory mechanism for septin filament formation and dissociation."

Cdc42 and its effector Gic1 are involved in septin recruitment, ring formation and dissociation. The regulatory mechanisms behind these processes are not well understood. Here, we have used electron microscopy and cryo electron tomography to elucidate the structural basis of the Gic1-septin and Gic1-Cdc42-septin interaction. We show that Gic1 acts as a scaffolding protein for septin filaments forming long and flexible filament cables. Cdc42 in its GTP-form binds to Gic1, which ultimately leads to the dissociation of Gic1 from the filament cables. Surprisingly, Cdc42-GDP is not inactive, but in the absence of Gic1 directly interacts with septin filaments resulting in their disassembly. We suggest that this unanticipated dual function of Cdc42 is crucial for the cell cycle. Based on our results we propose a novel regulatory mechanism for septin filament formation and dissociation."

However, high concentrations of the enzyme Cdc42 block the interaction between the Gic1 proteins and the subunits, causing the filaments to be dismantled. A future challenge will be to elucidate the interaction of these proteins in molecular detail using other techniques, in particular X-ray crystallography."

Gic1 interacts with Cdc10 subunits of adjacent septin filaments and cross-links them. Because of this scaffolding, septin filaments are stabilized and form long railroad-like ordered filament cables. Cdc42-GTP directly binds to Gic1 and at higher concentrations inhibits the Gic1 interaction with Cdc10, resulting in the dissociation of the Gic1-septin complex. In its GDP-state, however, in absence of Gic1 Cdc42 interacts directly with Cdc10 and thereby mechanically disassembles septin filaments. Gic1 and Cdc42-GDP therefore compete for the same septin subunit. Finally, based on our results we propose a novel regulatory mechanism for septin ring formation and dissociation involving Cdc42 and Gic1."

Gic1 forms cross-bridges between at least two filaments, keeping them at a distance of about 20 nm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). At each cross-bridge, Gic1 binds to at least two adjacent septin subunits on each filament (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), leaving a gap of six free subunits between individual Gic1 molecules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>).

Septin-Cdc11\u0394, however, which in accordance with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bertin et al., 2010</a>) does not polymerize (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) produced a similar track-like structure as the wildtype when Gic1 was added (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Thus, addition of Gic1 resulted not only in the binding of the protein to the septin complex but also induced septin polymerization. We then performed single particle analysis (SPA) of the septin filaments and observed that only four subunits were located between Gic1 cross-bridges of Cdc11\u0394 filaments, ruling out an interaction with Cdc12 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013I</a>)."

Notably, Cdc10 is mainly responsible for the specific interaction of septin filaments with PIP2, localizing them to membranes and promoting filament polymerization and organization (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bertin et al., 2010</a>). For Gic2, which is a homologue of Gic1, a direct interaction through its polybasic region with PIP2 was also reported (<a href=\"#bib29\">Orlando et al., 2008</a>). Together with our findings, this suggests that the organization and polymerization of septin filaments is controlled by the interaction of Gics with Cdc10 and the interaction of both proteins with PIP2."

Depending on the stain thickness we also observed these thin cross-links between bare septin filaments. However, in septin-Gic1 complexes, the large Gic1 cross-bridges are very prominent, causing stain to accumulate between the Gic1 cross-bridges. This makes it impossible to visualize the thin coiled-coils between Cdc3 and Cdc12, although they are probably still there."

We observed that Gic1, instead of cross-bridging only two filaments, simultaneously interacted with up to six septin polymers, forming long filament cables (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013G</a>). The organization of these cables is such that Gic1 forms a central scaffold to which septin filaments attach. Remarkably, individual septin filaments do not start at the same position and run along in parallel rigid lines. The septin-Gic1 cables are rather composed of many filaments of variable lengths that start at random positions, sometimes bypassing a Gic1 cross-bridge or changing place with another filament (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H\u2013I</a>). Filaments are often only attached to adjacent filaments for several nanometers. This gives the septin-Gic1 cables a certain flexibility that on the one hand allows them to bend and adjust to membrane curvature (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). On the other hand it enables the interaction between cables, resulting in mesh-like structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Because of the limited resolution of the reconstructions, the additional thin connections described by Bertin et al. (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bertin et al., 2008</a>) are not visible."

Gic1, which based on its sequence has a molecular weight of 23 kDa (Gic1(104-314)) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), elutes at about 49 kDa from a gel filtration column corresponding roughly to a dimer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In a typical Gic1 cross-bridge up to 12 Cdc10 subunits are involved (two per filament) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). If we assume that each of them binds independently to a Gic1 dimer, we would expect that 12 Gic1 dimers assemble into a large cross-bridge of 600 kDa. Although we cannot exclude that the density corresponding to Gic1 appears more spread out due to missing wedge artifacts in our tomograms, the average large volume of the Gic1 density in the electron tomograms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013I</a>) indicates that it must contain multiple Gic1 molecules. In addition, the heterogeneity of the Gic1 cross-bridges suggests that the number of Gic1 molecules varies between cross-bridges."

Gic1 and Cdc42, however, formed protein aggregates (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,F</a>). A possible explanation for this observation is that full decoration of Gic1 with Cdc42 destabilizes the Gic1 interaction with septins, resulting in dissociation of the septin-Gic1-Cdc42 complex. In contrast, Cdc42-GDP did not bind to septin-Gic1 complexes even at 10 times higher concentrations (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Similar behavior was reported for the functionally related human protein Borg (<a href=\"#bib20\">Joberty et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</a>). Borg binds with its BD3 domain to SEPT7/SEPT6 dimers and induces the formation of long and thick septin filament fibers (<a href=\"#bib19\">Joberty et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sheffield et al., 2003</a>).

Although Cdc42 in its GTP-state bound to septin filaments, no regular pattern as in the case of Gic1 was observed, indicating non-specific interaction (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Surprisingly, Cdc42-GDP bound more specifically to septin filaments, and formed, in contrast to Cdc42-GppNHp, railroad track-like structures (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Even more surprising was that Cdc42-GDP completely dissociated septin filaments at higher concentrations in less than an hour (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figures 9C and 10</a>). We then analyzed the oligomers by size-exclusion chromatography, which showed that Cdc42-GDP binds to septin complexes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). SPA of the dissociated septins clearly identified either octamers with an extra density at their ends (90%) or hexamers without additional density (10%) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E\u2013F</a>). Cdc3 sits at the ends of the hexamers, and at the second outer position of the octamers (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G\u2013H</a>). Considering the sequential order of septin oligomers, this indicates that Cdc42-GDP directly binds to Cdc10 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9I</a>), which is also the binding partner of Gic1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), thereby causing dissociation of the filaments. Consequently, the resulting septin octamers differ from the ones observed under high-salt conditions (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Instead of Cdc11, which is now in the center, Cdc10 forms the cap of the octamers at both ends. In addition, binding of Cdc42-GDP to Cdc10 probably influences its interaction with Cdc3 at the G interface resulting in the formation of Cdc42-GDP-Cdc10 dimers and hexameric (Cdc3-Cdc12-Cdc11) complexes. A direct interaction of a protein with Cdc42-GDP is unusual, since in most reported cases Cdc42, like other small G proteins, binds to its effectors in its active, that is GTP-bound state. However, also other proteins such as Msb3 and Msb4, which are GAP proteins, that are, like Gic1, involved in cell polarization, were shown to directly interact with Cdc42-GDP (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tcheperegine et al., 2005</a>)."

Examining the Cdc10-Cdc10 interface, which is an N/C interface, we found that the N-terminal region is the least conserved, and would therefore present an ideal site for specific Cdc42-GDP binding (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A\u2013B</a>). We deleted the N-terminal 29 residues of Cdc10 and produced complexes whose Cdc10 was replaced by Cdc10(30-322). It was previously shown that deletion of the N-terminal residues of Cdc10 results in non-polymerizing septin complexes forming tetramers and inside-out octamers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bertin et al., 2010</a>). We analyzed the particles by EM and SPA, which showed that most of the complexes were indeed tetramers or octamers, and that the polymerization of the complexes was clearly impaired, as we did not observe filaments at low-salt conditions (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A\u2013C</a>). We then incubated the oligomers with high concentrations of Cdc42-GDP and looked for additional densities corresponding to Cdc42-GDP by EM and SPA. However, no additional protein was bound to the tetramers or octamers (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13D\u2013F</a>). Gel filtration experiments corroborated this result and showed that indeed Cdc42-GDP does not bind to Cdc10(30-322) (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13G</a>). This indicates that the N-terminal region of Cdc10 is essential for the binding of Cdc42-GDP to septin filaments. Interestingly, the same region on Cdc10 was shown to be important for the interaction of septin filaments with PIP2 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bertin et al., 2010</a>)."

This was surprising, since Gic1 binds and crosslinks Cdc10 proteins while high salt weakens the interaction at the N/C-interface between two Cdc11 proteins. Thus, the stabilizing effect of Gic1 must be stronger than the weakening effect of high salt. We confirmed this observation by performing the inverse experiment, that is septin-Gic1 complexes were dialyzed against a high-salt buffer. As expected, septin-Gic1 complexes were stable and did not dissociate (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14E\u2013F</a>). Even septin complexes completely lacking Cdc11, which do not polymerize at low-salt conditions, form filaments when Gic1 is added (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>).

At the bud site Cdc42 interacts with its GEF Cdc24, which catalyzes the exchange of its nucleotide (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16B</a>). As a result, Cdc42 dissociates from the septin complexes, which in turn polymerize. Besides activating many other proteins involved in septin recruitment and ring formation Cdc42-GTP recruits its effector Gic1 to the bud site (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16C</a>). Gic1, which has a high affinity for Cdc10, binds, scaffolds and stabilizes septin filaments (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16D</a>). Gic1-Cdc42-GTP-septin cables generated in this manner form a ring at the bud neck. Since our data show that the process of Gic1-septin cable formation does not necessarily require Cdc42-GTP, we propose that upon GAP-supported GTP hydrolysis, Cdc42-GDP, which has a much lower affinity to Gic1 than Cdc42-GTP, dissociates from the Gic1-septin complex (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16E</a>) and recruits more septin octamers to the bud site (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16F</a>)."

As a result, Cdc42-GTP binds to Gic1-septin complexes and competes with Cdc10 for Gic1, which finally results in the disassembly of the complex and thereby septin ring rearrangement (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16G</a>). Gic1 will then be either degraded or relocated. After GTP hydrolysis, Cdc42-GDP in the absence of Gic1 specifically binds to septin filaments and dissociates them (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16H</a>). Thus, septins can be reassembled and reused for the next cycle, as was observed by McMurray and Thorner when tracking labeled septins through several cell divisions (<a href=\"#bib28\">McMurray and Thorner, 2009</a>). The model elegantly explains the cycles of GTP loading and hydrolysis by Cdc42 that were observed by Gladfelter et al. during budding (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gladfelter et al., 2002</a>). In conclusion, Gic1 and Cdc42 in combination with many other factors, such as the nucleotide state of septins, specific interaction with lipids and protein posttranslational modifications regulate septin recruitment, ring formation and disassembly. Most importantly, Cdc42 does not only act as a regulator, but seems to be also involved in septin recruitment."

Images were then centered, subjected to 2D reference-free rotational alignment (sxali2d) and k-means classification (sxk_means), with approximately 100-150 images per class. The images were then further aligned and classified by several rounds of multireference alignment (sxmref_ali2d), where only high quality classes were used as references, followed by k-means classification. Classification was performed within an elongated mask including the respective septin density, expanded by 5 pixels. For analysis of antibody binding, all members of class averages showing additional density were merged and subjected to further rounds of alignment and classification, with approximately 15-20 images per class.

Since the missing wedge artifact in this geometry causes only the elongation of the septin filaments, their exact tracing was straightforward, but the cables were often too short. We therefore scanned thousands of positions in several grids for both samples (septin-Gic1 and septin-Gic1-Cdc42-GppNHp) to find complexes of sufficient length and recorded two tomograms of such regions of septin-Gic1 and three tomograms of septin-Gic-Cdc42-GppNHp complexes.

We extracted all separate cables as subtomograms and processed them as described above.

In order to form the septin-Gic1 complexes, 1.5 \u00b5M of Gic1 was included during dialysis. Since Gic1 forms dimers and septin octamers contain two Cdc10 subunits, the molar ratio (Cdc10:Gic1) is 1.25:1. For antibody decoration, 5 \u03bcl of polyclonal antibodies against Cdc11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and Cdc3 (a gift from Michael Knop, DKFZ-ZMBH, Heidelberg, Germany) (diluted 1:100) were added to 20 \u03bcl of a sample containing either septin-Gic1 complex or the septin octamers (generated by GTP, Cdc42-GDP or both) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C to allow efficient binding."

Using a combination of negative stain electron microscopy and cryo electron tomography, along with manipulations of the septin complex or the nucleotide state of Cdc42, a dual role of Cdc42 was discovered. In the GTP-state, Cdc42 leads to disassembly of the Gic1-septin complex, whereas in the GDP-state, Cdc42 leads to further disassembly of the septin complex in absence of Gic1. Moreover, the cryo EM reconstructions show that Gic1 can bind to multiple septin filaments in a heterogeneous fashion, accounting for flexibility of septin filaments during cell division and cytokinesis."

Similarly, for Cdc42 itself, which is essential for septin assembly, it has not been determined if Cdc42 can bind septins and directly promotes filament assembly, filament bundling and/or if it simply indirectly recruits septins to the bud site."

For the remaining specimens, the resolution was determined by electron diffraction (this is only possible for ordered structures such as 2D crystals or helices).

In a typical Gic1 cross-bridge up to 12 Cdc10 subunits are involved (two per filament) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

Depending on the thickness of the stain, we can sometimes see them connecting two septin filaments also at lower septin filament concentration (Author response image 3B). The Gic1-mediated cross-bridges, however, are much larger and can easily be seen in negative stain electron microscopy. The stain accumulation between the Gic1 cross-bridges makes it impossible to visualize the thin cross-bridges emanating from coiled-coil interactions of the C-terminal extensions of Cdc3 and Cdc12, although they are probably still there. In addition, the resolution of the cryo electron tomography is not sufficient to visualize the thin coiled-coil cross-links between the C-terminal extensions of Cdc12 and Cdc3."
