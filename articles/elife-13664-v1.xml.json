To meet the growing demand for artemisinin and make it accessible to the poorest, an inexpensive and rapidly scalable production platform is urgently needed. Here we have developed a new synthetic biology approach, <span class=\"underline\">co</span>mbinatorial <span class=\"underline\">s</span>upertransformation of <span class=\"underline\">t</span>ransplastomic <span class=\"underline\">re</span>cipient <span class=\"underline\">l</span>ines (COSTREL), and applied it to introduce the complete pathway for artemisinic acid, the precursor of artemisinin, into the high-biomass crop tobacco. We first introduced the core pathway of artemisinic acid biosynthesis into the chloroplast genome. The transplastomic plants were then combinatorially supertransformed with cassettes for all additional enzymes known to affect flux through the artemisinin pathway. By screening large populations of COSTREL lines, we isolated plants that produce more than 120 milligram artemisinic acid per kilogram biomass. Our work provides an efficient strategy for engineering complex biochemical pathways into plants and optimizing the metabolic output."

To meet the growing demand for artemisinin and make it accessible to the poorest, an inexpensive and rapidly scalable production platform is urgently needed. Here we have developed a new synthetic biology approach, <span class=\"underline\">co</span>mbinatorial <span class=\"underline\">s</span>upertransformation of <span class=\"underline\">t</span>ransplastomic <span class=\"underline\">re</span>cipient <span class=\"underline\">l</span>ines (COSTREL), and applied it to introduce the complete pathway for artemisinic acid, the precursor of artemisinin, into the high-biomass crop tobacco. We first introduced the core pathway of artemisinic acid biosynthesis into the chloroplast genome. The transplastomic plants were then combinatorially supertransformed with cassettes for all additional enzymes known to affect flux through the artemisinin pathway. By screening large populations of COSTREL lines, we isolated plants that produce more than 120 milligram artemisinic acid per kilogram biomass. Our work provides an efficient strategy for engineering complex biochemical pathways into plants and optimizing the metabolic output."

It affects hundreds of millions of people \u2013 mainly in Africa and Asia \u2013 with almost half a million deaths every year. The most effective therapies against malaria all include the drug artemisinin, which is naturally found in an Asian plant called <i>Artemisia annua</i>. Unfortunately, the artemisinin content of <i>A. annua</i> plants is relatively low and the demand for this drug outstrips the supply of the plant. The costly production process makes artemisinin-based treatments inaccessible to many of the people in the most badly affected regions, and so researchers have been trying to find new ways to produce this drug."

Inside plant cells, a structure called the nucleus contains DNA that encodes most of a plant\u2019s genes, but compartments called mitochondria and chloroplasts also contain some DNA. Existing methods to genetically modify plants are able to insert a few genes into either the nucleus or the chloroplasts at a time. However, the production of artemisinin in <i>A. annua</i> involves many different genes that act at different stages of the process, and the precise roles played by many of them remain unclear."

The new method, referred to as COSTREL, takes advantage of the researchers\u2019 ability to insert new genes into both the nucleus and the chloroplast of the tobacco plants. In the first step, Fuentes et al. inserted a core set of genes that are essential to make artemisinin into the chloroplast. This enabled the plants to produce a molecule called artemisinic acid, which the researchers can extract from the plants and convert into artemisinin by simple chemical reactions."

The experiments generated hundreds of genetically modified plant lines that each have different combinations of the accessory genes. Fuentes et al. examined these lines and were able to identify plants that could produce large amounts of artemisinic acid. Therefore, these findings lay the foundations for a cheap way to produce this life-saving drug in tobacco. In the future, the COSTREL method developed by Fuentes et al. could also be used to genetically engineer other complex biochemical processes into plants."

As ACTs are the mainstay of malaria treatment and no alternative to artemisinin derivatives is expected to enter the market in the foreseeable future, there is a steadily increasing demand for ACTs which reached nearly 400 million treatment courses in 2013 (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014\">http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014</a>). The mechanism of action of artemisinin on the malaria parasites <i>Plasmodium falciparium</i> and <i>P. vivax</i> is not entirely clear, but it is generally believed that the reactive endoperoxide bridge present in the molecule (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) is responsible for its medicinal properties. In addition to their antimalarial activity, artemisinin and its derivatives are currently also considered as promising anti-cancer, antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., <a href=\"#bib49\">Willoughby et al., 2009</a>). In <i>A. annua</i>, artemisinin is produced in the cytosol of the glandular trichomes of leaves and flowers (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tang et al., 2014</a>). The biosynthesis initiates with the conversion of the isoprenoid building blocks IPP and DMAPP into farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) which is then converted into amorpha-4,11-diene by amorphadiene synthase (ADS), the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step of the pathway (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Amorpha-4,11-diene is a volatile compound that is oxidized to artemisinic alcohol and subsequently to artemisinic aldehyde by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP71AV1 (CYP) and its redox partner, the cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). Artemisinic aldehyde is then further oxidized to artemisinic acid by the same enzyme pair, or alternatively, is reduced to dihydroartemisinic aldehyde by the double bond reductase 2 (DBR2; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Artemisinic acid can be efficiently and cheaply converted to artemisinin by chemical means (<a href=\"#bib35\">Paddon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kopetzki et al., 2013</a>) and, therefore, represents a high-value precursor for the industrial production of artemisinin-based pharmaceuticals (<a href=\"#bib36\">Paddon and Keasling, 2014</a>)."

Amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS) converts FPP into amorpha-4,11-diene in the first committed step of the pathway. Amorpha-4,11-diene is then successively oxidized to artemisinic alcohol, artemisinic aldehyde and artemisinic acid by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP71AV1 (CYP) and its redox partner, the cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). In <i>A. annua</i>, artemisinic aldehyde is converted to dihydroartemisinic aldehyde by DBR2, and then to dihydroartemisinic acid by ALDH1.

However, the production costs are still high and ACTs remain unaffordable to many people in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia that are most severely afflicted with malaria. Since production in yeast requires large volumes of costly synthetic culture media and large-capacity bioreactors run under sterile conditions, production in plants can potentially provide a much cheaper, renewable and easily scalable source of artemisinic acid.

To this end, we designed a number of synthetic operons (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2013</a>) that combine the genes for the four core enzymes (FPS, ADS, CYP and CPR; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) in different arrangements and under the control of different expression signals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Four synthetic artemisinic acid operon constructs (pAO1-4) were built and introduced into the chloroplast (plastid) genome of tobacco plants by particle gun-mediated transformation.

This phenotype could be due to toxicity of artemisinic metabolites produced in these plants (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bharati et al., 2012</a>) or, alternatively, depletion of isoprenoid precursors from other metabolic pathways in the cell, such as carotenoid and chlorophyll biosyntheses. Measurement of chlorophylls and carotenoids confirmed that, indeed, both pigment classes are significantly reduced in plants exhibiting the mild phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>). Metabolite profiling (see Materials and Methods) of the transplastomic lines revealed that all lines accumulated the volatile artemisinic acid precursor amorpha-4,11-diene and its first oxidation product artemisinic alcohol (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

This hypothesis gained support from the analysis of a series of developmental stages and leaf ages which revealed that, while in <i>Nt</i>-AO2 plants, artemisinic acid accumulates only in mature leaves of young and flowering plants, it accumulates throughout development in <i>Nt</i>-AO3 plants. These analyses also confirmed the inverse relationship between artemisinic acid and amorpha-4,11-diene accumulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>)."

                                "text": "To identify the molecular basis of the striking metabolic differences between the different operon constructs, a series of northern blot experiments was conducted. In view of the commonalities of the <i>Nt</i>-AO2 and <i>Nt</i>-AO4 plants versus the <i>Nt</i>-AO1 and <i>Nt</i>-AO3 plants, it seemed reasonable to assume that the relative orientation of the two operons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) is causally responsible for the different visual and metabolic phenotypes. When the expression of the four transgenes was assayed, a striking difference was observed in the <i>CYP/CPR</i> expression ratio in that high artemisinic acid accumulation correlated with a high <i>CYP/CPR</i> expression ratio in <i>Nt</i>-AO3 plants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013G</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In nature, CYPs are often found in excess to their CPR counterparts, with ratios of 10\u2013100:1 or higher (reviewed, e.g., in <a href=\"#bib17\">Guengerich,\u00a02002</a>). Even though there is currently no consensus explanation for this observation, it is known that CPRs can activate molecular oxygen, thereby producing superoxide radicals and wasting redox capacity of the cell (<a href=\"#bib27\">Manoj et al., 2010</a>). A high CYP/CPR ratio would prevent this CPR-mediated toxicity and result in a more efficient use of the redox power of the cell for artemisinic acid synthesis, as observed in our <i>Nt</i>-AO1 and <i>Nt</i>-AO3 transplastomic lines. This explanation is also in agreement with published data on transcript accumulation and protein abundance for these two enzymes in <i>A. annua</i>. While the levels of the <i>CPR</i> transcript and the CPR protein remain constant during development of the plant and in different organs, the transcript and protein levels of CYP increase in the developmental stages and organs where artemisinin synthesis is induced (<a href=\"#bib34\">Olofsson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zeng et al., 2008</a>). Especially the final oxidation step from artemisinic aldehyde to artemisinic acid appears to require an effective monooxygenase (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ting et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that the higher levels of artemisinic acid in our transplastomic <i>Nt</i>-AO1 and <i>Nt</i>-AO3 lines are most likely related to their higher <i>CYP/CPR</i> expression ratio. However, determination of the CYP and CPR protein accumulation levels (and enzyme activities) would be necessary to precisely assess these ratios and ultimately confirm their impact on metabolite conversion in the pathway."

                                "text": "Having successfully implemented the canonical pathway of artemisinic acid synthesis into the chloroplast of tobacco plants, we next sought to maximize artemisinic acid production. In our best-performing transplastomic plants (<i>Nt</i>-AO3), artemisinic acid accumulation reached a maximum of 2\u20134 mg/kg fresh weight (FW), equivalent to approximately 20\u201340 mg/kg dry weight (DW; or 0.002\u20130.004% DW), a level significantly lower than artemisinin accumulation in <i>A. annua</i> (varying between 0.01 and 1% DW; <a href=\"#bib22\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bryant et al., 2015</a>). Recently, a number of accessory <i>A. annua</i> enzymes have been identified that enhance the flux through the pathway, including a cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> (CYB5) that promotes electron transfer to P450 monooxygenases (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schenkman and Jansson, 2003</a>), a new alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1) that improves the oxidation of artemisinic alcohol to artemisinic aldehyde (<a href=\"#bib35\">Paddon et al., 2013</a>) and an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1) that catalyzes the conversion of dihydroartemisinic aldehyde into dihydroartemisinic acid and, in yeast, also enhances the conversion of artemisinic aldehyde into artemisinic acid (<a href=\"#bib35\">Paddon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We also considered two additional enzymes: The double bond reductase 2 (DBR2) from <i>A. annua</i> introduces a branch point into the pathway by reducing artemisinic aldehyde to dihydroartemisinic aldehyde (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>) and, therefore, potentially can lead to the synthesis of artemisinin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Finally, the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) from the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>, a key regulatory enzyme in the MEP pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis, was selected because its expression may improve precursor availability (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Since the quantitative contributions of these enzyme activities to artemisinic acid biosynthesis are not well understood and, moreover, the optimum enzyme activities required to mediate maximum flux through the pathway are unknown, we decided to pursue a combinatorial supertransformation approach. Combinatorial transformation involves the mixing of multiple single-gene transformation constructs and their biolistic co-transformation followed by large-scale screening of many transgenic lines by their metabolic (or other) phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Naqvi et al., 2009</a>). Individual transgenic lines generated by this approach differ in the transgene combination they harbor as well as in transgene copy numbers and expression levels, thus facilitating selection of optimized genotypes that condition the desired metabolic output (<a href=\"#bib31\">Naqvi et al., 2009</a>). We applied combinatorial nuclear transformation to our transplastomic <i>Nt</i>-AO2-1 (high accumulation of amorpha-4,11-diene but low levels of artemisinic acid) and <i>Nt</i>-AO3-1 (low accumulation of amorpha-4,11-diene and high accumulation of artemisinic acid) lines, assuming that artemisinic acid production can be substantially increased by identifying the optimum combination and expression levels of the additional pathway enzymes. Combinatorial supertransformation of transplastomic lines encoding a canonical metabolic pathway with a plasmid cocktail containing additional and/or accessory pathway enzymes represents a new approach in synthetic biology that we refer to as COSTREL (for COmbinatorial Supertransformation of Transplastomic REcipient Lines)."

After rooting in kanamycin-containing medium, 512 plantlets were transferred to soil and grown to maturity under standard greenhouse conditions. At the onset of flowering, a fully expanded leaf was harvested for preliminary profiling of artemisinic acid and its precursors by GC-MS (see Materials and Methods). Based on growth, phenotype and fertility of the plants, 199 COSTREL lines were selected for metabolic screening of artemisinic compounds: 79 <i>Nt</i>-AO2-CS and 120 <i>Nt</i>-AO3-CS lines (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>).

An alternative explanation for the lack of artemisinin accumulation could be that COSTREL lines that produce artemisinin were not recovered, because artemisinin is highly toxic to photosynthetically active cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bharati et al., 2012</a>). The fact that no artemisinin could be detected and only low amounts of dihydroartemisinic acid were obtained in a few lines, whereas artemisinic acid accumulated to high amounts, may indicate that future efforts should be focused on maximizing the production of artemisinic acid."

When used as an oral monotherapy, artemisinin can promote the development of resistance in the parasite (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mok et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Straimer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mbengue et al., 2015</a>) and, therefore, ACTs are based on fixed-dose co-formulations that combine two different active ingredients in one tablet. Development of an inexpensive and sustainable production method that is suitable to meet the constantly growing demand for artemisinin and its derivatives has remained a grand challenge. Enormous breeding efforts are currently underway to produce new varieties of <i>A. annua</i> that accumulate higher and more consistent levels of the compound (<a href=\"#bib16\">Graham et al., 2010</a>). However, as <i>A. annua</i> produces artemisinin only in a very small fraction of the leaf cells (the glandular trichomes) and its cultivation is inefficient, slow and vulnerable to adverse environmental conditions, the development of a production method that is independent of <i>A. annua</i> is highly desirable (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bryant et al., 2015</a>). If accomplished in a high-biomass non-food/non-feed crop, this would provide a stable supply of the feedstock that can be scaled up at will and at short notice, and take full advantage of the existing agricultural infrastructure. In the course of this work, we have established tobacco as an efficient production factory for artemisinic acid. Tobacco is a high-biomass crop, grown in large acreages, for which alternative uses (that are unrelated to smoking) have long been sought. Since tobacco is well suited for cultivation at high cropping densities and multiple harvests (4\u20135) per season are possible, 40\u2009t of biomass can be obtained from a single acre of tobacco field at a cost of only around $100 per ton (<a href=\"http://tobacco.ces.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/tobacco-production-cost-2011-1.pdf?fwd=no\">http://tobacco.ces.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/tobacco-production-cost-2011-1.pdf?fwd=no</a>). Thus, with our best-performing COSTREL line, production levels of ~4.8\u2009kg artemisinic acid per acre can be obtained, suggesting that the current world demand (of ~100\u2009t artemisinin) can be met by cultivating tobacco on an area of ~200 km<sup>2</sup>, which is less than the area of the city of Boston (assuming ~50% loss during extraction and conversion of artemisinic acid to artemisinin; <a href=\"#bib35\">Paddon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kopetzki et al., 2013</a>)."

Together with the absence of toxic effects of artemisinic acid on the chloroplast (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), this offers great potential for further enhancement of the pathway by addressing the bottlenecks that limit flux in our current best-performing lines. Furthermore, previous transgenic work has shown that the redox environment in the cytosol of tobacco cells favors reduction of aldehydes to alcohols rather than their oxidation to acids, thus limiting the ability of the cytosolically located pathway to produce high quantities of artemisinic acid (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). The high levels of artemisinic acid achieved in this work by implementing the pathway into plastids suggest that the chloroplast offers a more favorable redox milieu that allows the quantitative conversion of artemisinic alcohol into artemisinic acid (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Although tobacco leaves also possess glandular trichomes (where artemisinin is produced in <i>A. annua</i>), the trichomes in our COSTREL plants are unlikely to accumulate large amounts of artemisinic acid. This is because transgene expression from the plastid genome is generally very low in non-photosynthetic tissues and cell types. It can be significantly enhanced by designing specific (chimeric) expression signals that confer high transgene activity in non-green tissues (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Caroca et al., 2013</a>), but the expression signals used to drive our synthetic artemisinic acid operons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) are not suitable to trigger efficient gene expression in non-photosynthetic plastids."

Being the biosynthetic center of the plant cell, the chloroplast contains large pools of diverse metabolites that can be tapped. Expression of genes for metabolic enzymes from the plastid genome has a number of attractions, including high expression levels, simple stacking of multiple transgenes in synthetic operons (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gnanasekaran et al., 2016</a>) and high-precision engineering via homologous recombination (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maliga, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bock, 2015</a>). Previously, plastid transformation was employed to enhance endogenous metabolic pathways (<a href=\"#bib3\">Apel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2013</a>) or to produce novel metabolites, such as ketocarotenoids and biopolymers (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hasunuma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bohmert-Tatarev et al., 2011</a>). Recently, two ER-resident cytochrome P450 enzymes of the dhurrin pathway (a cyanogenic glucoside from sorghum) were successfully expressed from a synthetic operon in tobacco chloroplasts (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gnanasekaran et al., 2016</a>). Together with the third pathway enzyme, a glucosyltransferse, the two P450 enzymes catalyzed the formation of dhurrin from tyrosine. The activity of the P450 enzymes was strictly light-dependent, indicating that the electrons used come from the photosynthetic electron transport chain (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gnanasekaran et al., 2016</a>). This suggests that, at least when P450 enzymes are anchored to the thylakoid membrane, reduced ferredoxin can replace the NADPH-dependent native reductase (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gnanasekaran et al., 2016</a>), thus making the chloroplast a superb compartment for the implementation of secondary metabolic pathways that involve P450-catalyzed reactions."

Subsequent combinatorial supertransformation of the nuclear genome with genes for auxiliary and regulatory factors then allows fine-tuning of the pathway and optimization of metabolic flux by screening metabolic phenotypes of hundreds of transgenic lines that differ in the set of transgenes they harbor in the genome and the expression levels of the transgenes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Naqvi et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib32\">2010</a>). Importantly, this approach requires no prior knowledge about the contributions of the individual factors to metabolic flux and the optimum expression strength of each transgene. Previous metabolic engineering work in microorganisms has demonstrated that the success is often more dependent on achieving the optimum balance of enzyme activities than on the absolute levels of enzyme (over)expression (e.g., <a href=\"#bib37\">Peralta-Yahya et al., 2012</a>). The use of combinatorial supertransformation, therefore, provides a significant advantage over the construction of large transformation vectors expressing multiple pathway genes, because the great variation between transgenic events in (i) the transgene combination present, (ii) the copy numbers of the individual transgenes and (iii) the absolute and relative expression strengths of the transgenes (depending, e.g., on the integration site in the genome and the structure of the transgenic locus) is likely to yield at least some events that harbor the optimum combination of transgenes and provide the right balance of enzyme activities. Moreover, the characterization of these elite events can provide valuable information about pathway regulation, limiting steps and bottlenecks that should be the target of future engineering and optimization efforts. In sum, our COSTREL strategy provides a new synthetic biology tool that facilitates the efficient transfer of complex metabolic pathways into new host organisms while, at the same time, maximizing the metabolic output."

                                "text": "The synthetic operon constructs for chloroplast transformation (pAO1-4) are based on plastid transformation vector pKP9 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>). They all contain the four genes required for the canonical artemisinic acid biosynthetic pathway in <i>Artemisia annua: FPS</i> (AF112881), <i>ADS</i> (AF138959), <i>CYP71AV1 (CYP</i>, DQ268763) and <i>CPR</i> (DQ318192; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The genes were codon optimized for expression in the chloroplast and chemically synthesized (GeneArt, Regensburg, Germany). The four genes were then assembled into synthetic operons as follows. The <i>CYP71AV1 (CYP</i>) gene was synthesized with a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence derived from the chloroplast <i>rbcL</i> gene and with the flanking restriction sites NheI (at the 5\u2019 end) and XbaI (at the 3\u2019 end). The gene was cloned into pZF1 replacing the <i>P24</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>) and generating construct pZF83. pZF1 is an intermediate cloning construct that contains the promoter from the rRNA operon from tobacco (P<i>rrn</i>), the leader sequence from the <i>gene 10</i> of bacteriophage T7 (<i>T7</i> L<i>g10</i>), the <i>P24</i> capsid protein gene of HIV-1 and the terminator of the chloroplast <i>rbcL</i> gene (T<i>rbcL</i>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>). A fragment containing the rRNA operon promoter from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr</i> P<i>rrn</i>), the T7 L<i>g10</i>, the <i>gfp</i> gene, the terminator of the <i>atpA</i> gene from the chloroplast genome of <i>C. reinhardtii (Cr</i> T<i>atpA</i>) and the intercistronic expression element (IEE; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>) was excised with SacI and NheI from a modified version of construct pDK139 in which the ClaI, SalI and XhoI restriction sites between <i>Cr</i> T<i>atpA</i> and IEE were removed by XhoI/HindIII digestion and blunting of the overhanging ends by a fill-in reaction with Klenow enzyme. pDK139 is a chloroplast transformation construct based on vector pHK20 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kuroda and Maliga, 2001</a>). The excised fragment was cloned into pZF83, replacing the region spanning P<i>rrn</i> and T7 L<i>g10</i> and generating construct pZF84. Next, the <i>FPS</i> gene was synthesized flanked by NdeI and PacI restriction sites at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends, respectively. The excised NdeI/PacI restriction fragment was cloned into the identically digested pZF84, replacing the <i>gfp</i> gene and giving rise to plasmid pZF85. The complete fragment from <i>Cr</i> P<i>rrn</i> to T<i>rbcL</i> was then cut out from pZF85 with SacI and ClaI and ligated into chloroplast transformation vector pKP9 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>), producing clone pZF90. The <i>ADS</i> gene was synthesized (flanked by NcoI and EcoRV restriction sites) and cloned into vector pKCZaphA-6, replacing the <i>aphA-6</i> gene and giving rise to plasmid pZF86. pKCZaphA-6 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fleischmann et al., 2011</a>) is an intermediate cloning construct that contains the <i>C. reinhardtii psbA</i> promoter (<i>Cr</i> P<i>psbA</i>), the <i>C. reinhardtii psbA</i> leader (<i>Cr</i> L<i>psbA</i>), the <i>aphA-6</i> gene for kanamycin resistance and the <i>C. reinhardtii rbcL</i> terminator (<i>Cr</i> T<i>rbcL</i>). Next, the terminator of the tobacco <i>rps16</i> gene (T<i>rps16</i>) was amplified by PCR with primers containing EcoRV and PstI restriction sites at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends, respectively, and cloned into pZF86 digested with the same enzymes, generating vector pZF87. The <i>CPR</i> gene was synthesized as a PstI/SphI restriction fragment with the <i>rbcL</i> SD sequence and an IEE element at its 5\u2019 end. The fragment was cloned into pZF87 digested with the same enzymes, giving rise to pZF88. Artemisinic acid operon constructs pAO1 and pAO2 were generated by digesting pZF88 with ClaI (releasing the cassette containing the <i>ADS-CPR</i> dicistron between <i>Cr</i> P<i>psbA</i> and <i>Cr</i> T<i>rbcL</i>) and cloning this cassette into pZF90 digested with the same enzyme. In vector pAO1, the <i>ADS-CPR</i> cassette is integrated in sense orientation, downstream of the <i>FPS-CYP</i> cassette, whereas in construct pAO2, the fragment is integrated in antisense (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). For generation of pAO3 and pAO4, the <i>Cr</i> P<i>psbA - Cr</i> L<i>psbA</i> fragment was eliminated from pZF88 by digestion with MluI and NcoI and subsequently replaced by a PCR-amplified <i>Cr</i> P<i>psbA</i> - T7 L<i>g10</i> fragment obtained by digestion with the same enzymes, thus generating plasmid clone pZF89. pZF89 was then digested with ClaI and cloned into pZF90 in a similar way as for generation of pAO1 and pAO2. Construct pAO3 originates from integration of the <i>ADS-CPR</i> cassette in sense orientation, whereas pAO4 harbors the cassette in antisense orientation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

To generate these constructs, the <i>RBCS</i> transit peptide (TP) was amplified by PCR with primers introducing XbaI/XhoI, ApaI/XhoI or SpeI/XhoI restriction sites into the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of the amplification product, respectively.

A stainless steel ball was added to the mixture and the samples incubated for 20\u2009min at 30\u00b0C and 1,400\u2009rpm in the dark. After centrifugation for 5\u2009min at 12,000\u2009rpm and 4\u00b0C, the upper phase was collected in a new microcentrifuge tube and stored on ice in darkness. The acetone extraction was repeated two more times, using 250 \u00b5L of acetone each time and combining the three upper phases. Following centrifugation for 5\u2009min at 12,000\u2009rpm and 4\u00b0C to precipitate any remaining insoluble material, 600 \u00b5L of the acetone extracts were transferred to 9\u2009mm glass vials. Samples were analyzed using a Waters UPLC Class H (Milford, USA) equipped with an autosampler, Quaternary Solvent Manager, and e\u03bb PDA detector. Pigments were separated in a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C<sub>18</sub> 1.7 \u00b5m C18 2.1 \u00d7 50\u2009mm column at 28\u00b0C, using UPLC solutions A and B. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 0.5\u2009mL/min with the following gradient: 100\u20130% of solution A from 0 to 5\u2009min, 100% solution B from 5 to 6\u2009min, 0\u2013100% solution A from 6 to 6.5\u2009min, and 100% solution A from 6.5 to 7.5\u2009min. Carotenoids were detected at 450 nm and chlorophylls at 640 nm. Three biological replicates (i.e., independent plants) per condition were measured and data were analyzed with the Empower 3 software."

It can be significantly enhanced by designing specific (chimeric) expression signals that confer high transgene activity in non-green tissues (Zhang et al., 2012, Caroca et al., 2013), but the expression signals used to drive our synthetic artemisinic acid operons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) were chosen to maximize expression in chloroplasts and, therefore, are not suitable to trigger efficient gene expression in non-photosynthetic plastids.
