To determine whether striatal ensembles drive subjects' judgments of duration, we manipulated and recorded from striatal neurons in rats performing a duration categorization psychophysical task. We found that the dynamics of striatal neurons predicted duration judgments, and that simultaneously recorded ensembles could judge duration as well as the animal. Furthermore, striatal neurons were necessary for duration judgments, as muscimol infusions produced a specific impairment in animals' duration sensitivity. Lastly, we show that time as encoded by striatal populations ran faster or slower when rats judged a duration as longer or shorter, respectively. These results demonstrate that the speed with which striatal population state changes supports the fundamental ability of animals to judge the passage of time."

To determine whether striatal ensembles drive subjects' judgments of duration, we manipulated and recorded from striatal neurons in rats performing a duration categorization psychophysical task. We found that the dynamics of striatal neurons predicted duration judgments, and that simultaneously recorded ensembles could judge duration as well as the animal. Furthermore, striatal neurons were necessary for duration judgments, as muscimol infusions produced a specific impairment in animals' duration sensitivity. Lastly, we show that time as encoded by striatal populations ran faster or slower when rats judged a duration as longer or shorter, respectively. These results demonstrate that the speed with which striatal population state changes supports the fundamental ability of animals to judge the passage of time."

A number of recent studies have identified dynamics that allow for robust representation of time by populations of neurons in multiple areas including the hippocampus\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib31\">Pastalkova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">MacDonald et al., 2011</a>), prefrontal\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Kim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Xu et al., 2014</a>), parietal\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Leon and Shadlen, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Janssen and Shadlen, 2005</a>) and motor\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Lebedev et al., 2008</a>) cortices, cerebellum\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Mauk and Buonomano, 2004</a>), and the striatum\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Matell et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Jin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adler, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mello et al., 2015</a>). However, any dynamics that result in a continuously-evolving and non-repeating population state can be used to encode time\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Buonomano, 2014</a>), and it is not known whether such temporal representations would inform subjects\u2019 judgments of duration or merely covary with elapsing time. The striatum, a brain structure known to be involved in reinforcement learning and decision making\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Lau and Glimcher, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Samejima et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lee et al., 2015</a>), has been implicated in interval timing by several lines of evidence\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Hinton and Meck, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Harrington et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wencil et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Malapani, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Meck, 2006</a>). However, whether dynamics in striatal activity can explain the perceptual performance of behaving subjects is unknown. To determine whether striatal ensembles drive subjects\u2019 judgments of duration, we manipulated and recorded from striatal neurons in rats performing a duration categorization psychophysical task."

For a reconstruction of striatal recording sites see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1.</a>). We observed that striatal neurons displayed diverse firing patterns, with different units firing at different times within the interval period (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b\u2013d</a>). Can such firing patterns support duration judgments? To determine whether and the degree to which individual neurons could contribute to duration judgments, for each trial, we counted spikes in the last 500 ms of the interval period and compared spike count distributions of short vs long stimulus trials using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). We found that the majority of neurons (~57%) preferred either short or long stimuli (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>; short-preferring: n = 159/433, 36.7%; long-preferring: n = 87/433, 20.1%; permutation test, p&lt;0.05). As expected, short-preferring neurons displayed higher firing on average prior to the 1.5 s category boundary, after which long-preferring neurons displayed higher firing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>). These averaged activity patterns resemble the likelihood of receiving reward on a\u00a0moment-by-moment by basis should the animal choose short or long (compare with reward contingency in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). Such signals, previously observed in the parietal cortex of monkeys performing a similar timing task\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Leon and Shadlen, 2003</a>) and in the striatum in a value based decision task\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Lau and Glimcher, 2008</a>), are potentially useful for guiding choice. However, were animals\u2019 judgments indeed guided by such signals, it should be possible to predict choices reported later in the trial using neural activity collected during interval stimuli. Indeed, in trials wherein a near boundary interval was judged as long, firing of the short (long) preferring subpopulation dropped (rose) faster, so that the two curves crossed before the 1.5 s boundary (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>). Conversely, in trials wherein the same interval was judged as short, the two curves evolved more slowly so that at the time of interval offset the short preferring subpopulation was still firing at a higher level and a crossing point had not yet been reached (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2h</a>)."

                        "text": "The observation of large proportions of short- and long-preferring neurons whose dynamics predicted choice is evidence that duration judgments are guided by the state of striatal populations. Might the information afforded by ensembles of striatal neurons account for the pattern of subjects\u2019 judgments across all stimuli? To test this hypothesis, we compared session to session fluctuations in behavioral performance with the separability of activity states of simultaneously recorded ensembles at the offset of short as compared to long intervals. Briefly, for each trial in a session we characterized neural population state as a vector <b>r</b> = (r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>,... , r<sub>N</sub>), where <i>r<sub>n</sub></i> is the number of spikes fired by neuron <i>n</i> \u2208 [1,N] within the last 500 ms of the interval period. Next, for each session we found the linear discriminant that best separated population state vectors according to whether they came from a long or a short interval trial (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). A threshold placed along the linear discriminant was then used as a decision rule (black line in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>) to generate a \u2018neural duration judgment\u2019 for each trial. This procedure allowed us to obtain, for each session, a quantitative description of how well simultaneously recorded neurons could categorize stimuli, i.e., a neurometric function comparable to the behavioral psychometric function (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Consistent with duration information being encoded at the population level, we found that for sessions in which greater numbers of neurons were recorded simultaneously (i.e. upper tercile of sessions with regard to population size) psychometric and neurometric performances were similar and strongly correlated (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.76, p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). These results demonstrate that a read out of stimulus category from even modestly-sized ensembles of striatal neurons was in many cases sufficient to explain the pattern of duration judgments produced by behaving subjects."

In addition, it is well known that striatal neurons can fire around movements\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexander and Crutcher, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jin and Costa, 2010</a>). Could the categorization performance of striatal ensembles reflect activity related to movements the animal might be making during the task? To test to what degree ongoing behavior could explain the categorization performance of striatal neural activity, we applied an analogous classification analysis to video images taken of the animal just before interval offset (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). We found that our ability to categorize intervals using video frames was consistently poorer as compared to neural data collected at the analogous time periods during the task (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, inset in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). In contrast, we were able to categorize stimuli as well as the animal using video frames taken at the point when animals expressed their choice at one of the reward ports (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>). Furthermore, movement related responses in the striatum are known to occur both pre- and post-movement onset, much later than in other motor areas such as pre-motor and motor cortex\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexander and Crutcher, 1990</a>). Thus, if purely movement-related activity were responsible for the categorization performance of striatal ensembles, we would expect ensemble performance to display a similar time course to that of video frames. Applying the same analyses at multiple points in time ranging from 500 ms preceding to 500 ms following stimulus offset revealed a strikingly different profile of categorization performance for video frames as compared to neural ensembles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d\u2013e</a>). Specifically, the time course of duration categorization by neural ensembles was best correlated with the duration categorization by video frames when using spikes collected between 400 ms and 200 ms preceding a reference video frame. These indicate that the categorization performance of striatal neurons was not simply related to the immediate sensorimotor state of the animal, and instead likely reflects that striatal neurons encode an internal neural representation of the state of animals\u2019 categorical decisions."

Indeed, when population state at stimulus offset had advanced relatively more or less along the mean trajectory, animals were more likely to judge intervals as long or short respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f\u2013g</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This effect was observed most consistently for interval stimuli that were closer to the category boundary, and thus variations in projected population state led to horizontal shifts in the psychometric curves (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). These data are consistent with striatal population state encoding a representation of elapsed time that is used by animals to determine categorical judgments. Indeed, such a pattern of population activity has been proposed as a suitable neural code for elapsing time\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Buonomano, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Buonomano and Merzenich, 1995</a>)."

Indeed, even in a low dimensional projection of population activity, we found that network state ran ahead or behind depending on whether the animal judged a near boundary stimulus as long or short (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b\u2013c</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b,c</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2b,f,j</a>). The correspondence between population trajectory and duration judgments further suggests that striatal dynamics may form an internal representation of elapsed time that informed categorical decisions about duration. To directly test this hypothesis, we focused on stimuli near the category boundary and decoded time from the population using a naive Bayes decoder and asked whether such a representation correlated with animals\u2019 judgments, exhibiting choice probability\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Britten et al., 1996</a>). We found that decoded estimates of time ran faster or slower when animals judged a given stimulus as long or short, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d\u2013g</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1d-g</a>,\u00a0cross validated naive Bayes decoder; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). This indicates that striatal activity provides information about elapsing time, the continuously varying decision variable necessary to inform judgments in the task. Furthermore, if this information were read out and used to guide judgments, those judgments would match those of the rats."

To test whether this was the case, we bilaterally injected the GABAa receptor agonist muscimol (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). As a result, the duration sensitivity of animals\u2019 judgments dropped significantly as compared to interleaved saline control sessions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>; psychometric slope on saline sessions = [1.03 1.20] vs on muscimol sessions = [0.28 0.67]; 95% confidence intervals), yet animals otherwise performed normally. These results, by demonstrating that duration categorization in this task was dependent on a normally functioning striatum, suggest that the neural signals we observed directly supported duration judgments. However, the possibility that muscimol infusions changed other functions important for task performance such as reward processing or memory for the mapping between time and choice can not be ruled out."

                        "text": "Attempts to understand the neural mechanisms of time estimation have begun to focus on continuously evolving population dynamics as a general mechanism for time encoding across the brain\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">MacDonald et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mauk and Buonomano, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Buonomano, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Buonomano and Merzenich, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Gershman et al., 2013</a>). According to this view, time may be encoded by any reproducible pattern of activity across a population of neurons for as long as the pattern is continuously changing and non-repeating. However, no study to date has directly compared the speed of such \u201cpopulation clocks\u201d with the duration judgments of the behaving subjects in which they are found. We show that as rats judged the duration of interval stimuli, striatal neurons displayed dynamics in firing rate that contained information about elapsed time. Furthermore, this information was sufficient to account for the animals\u2019 perceptual decisions, and was not accompanied by systematic differences in outwardly expressed behavior over time. Combined with the observation that striatal inactivation caused a specific decrement in timing performance, these data suggest that striatal dynamics form a central neural representation of time that guides animals\u2019 decisions about duration. Such a coding mechanism in the striatum is well situated to inform the appropriate selection of actions through downstream circuitry involving the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and various extrinsic connections between the basal ganglia and brainstem, thalamic, and cortical motor areas\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Steiner and Tseng, 2010</a>). An intriguing question for future studies is how the striatal dynamics we observed during the interval discrimination task are generated. Neurons in multiple cortical layers spread across the entire cortical mantle, as well as thalamic, pallidal, and neuromodulatory populations provide input to the striatum. While time coding has been assessed in some of these populations, a careful analysis of simultaneously recorded populations that might uncover causal relationships between signals in multiple brain areas has not been carried out. Furthermore, local striatal circuitry may also play a role in shaping dynamics. However, the coding properties tested here could be tested in other brain areas where timing signals have been identified such as the hippocampus\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib31\">Pastalkova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">MacDonald et al., 2011</a>), medial prefrontal\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Kim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Xu et al., 2014</a>), parietal\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Leon and Shadlen, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Janssen and Shadlen, 2005</a>) and motor\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Lebedev et al., 2008</a>) cortices, and the cerebellum\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Mauk and Buonomano, 2004</a>), among others. By comparing the signals recorded simultaneously in multiple brain areas during time estimation tasks, it should be possible to identify signatures of functional interaction between brain areas where they exist. Such an approach promises to elucidate where and how time information encoded at the population level is used by the brain to support the myriad time-dependent functions we and other organisms rely on for survival."

Individual frames from approximately 75 ms before interval offset were used for this analysis (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This buffer was added to ensure that all frames used preceded stimulus offset. Images were first represented as vectors composed of individual pixel luminance values. Given that image sequences tend to lie on curved low dimensional manifolds in pixel space\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Pless, 2003</a>), any slight differences in behavioral state reflected in images collected at the offset of short and long interval categories are not necessarily expected to be linearly separable. Thus, we employed isomap\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib35\">Tenenbaum and Silva, 2000</a>), a non-linear dimensionality reduction method, to obtain an information rich yet low dimensional representation of animals\u2019 ongoing behavior. This approach has the advantage over tracking methods that it does not make assumptions as to what part of the animals\u2019 movements might provide information about stimulus category. The neighborhood size, used to compute the shortest paths between data points, was set to 25 frames to minimize, on average, the dimensionality at which the reconstruction error elbow occurred. In analogy with the neurometric curves, for each stimulus type, we then trained a linear discriminant (leave-one-out cross-validation procedure) to classify frames into those that were recorded during trials where a \u2018short\u2019 or \u2018long\u2019 stimulus interval was presented. The classification was performed in the reduced space determined by isomap. As a positive control for the method, we repeated the same analysis for frames captured at the moment animals expressed their judgment by inserting their snout at one of the two choice ports (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Here, the neighborhood size was chosen to be the minimum for which all frames (from a single session) could be included in a single embedding. This analysis was done for all usable videos (8 out of 11) of sessions in the upper tercile with regard to population size."

This generated neural and video classification curves that described the ability of simultaneously recorded neural ensembles and video frames to correctly classify interval stimuli as long or short (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>).

The authors use a behavioral task in which rats are trained to nose poke left or right depending on the interval between two auditory tones \u2013 specifically, whether the interval was short or long in relation to a 1.5 s reference. Striatal recordings from hundreds of cells revealed a robust temporal code: it was possible to determine elapsed time from the onset of the trial based on the current population vector with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, it was possible to predict the incorrect behavioral responses based on whether the population trajectory was \"running early\" or \"running late\". Together with timing-effects of muscimol infusions in striatum (although see concerns below), these data provide and important physiological link between striatal processing and sensory timing."

In all individual sessions, muscimol infusions produced a significant decrease in the sensitivity of animals\u2019 judgments to interval duration as compared to saline infusions performed on the previous day. It is important to point out that these are reversible inactivations, not permanent lesions, allowing us to collect multiple control and test conditions within each animal.

We have now included language explaining this interpretive issue (Results). The experiment that the reviewer seems to be asking for is one wherein we systematically speed or slow the spatiotemporal patterns of activity within striatal populations. Indeed we would love to do such an experiment, although accomplishing this is not trivial and furthermore we believe it is beyond the scope of this paper.
