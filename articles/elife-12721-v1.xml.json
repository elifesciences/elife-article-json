Eusociality is a form of social organization that has evolved in some animals, notably ants, bees and termites, and that involves, among other things, some individuals foregoing opportunities to reproduce so that they can care for the offspring of others (<a href=\"#bib2\">H\u00f6lldobler and Wilson, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">2009</a>). The existence of these \u2018worker\u2019 individuals is an evolutionary conundrum that has long fascinated biologists. How can genes that encode help to\u00a0others,\u00a0at the cost of not being transmitted to future generations, survive in the long run? How can genes that make their carriers sterile be a successful evolutionary invention?"

Then these genes may be passed on if the workers preferentially help other members of the population that also carry these genes but do not express them (i.e., are not workers). The theory of kin selection introduced a concept called \u2018inclusive fitness\u2019 to explain this: inclusive fitness takes into account not\u00a0only the reproductive success of a particular individual who carries a gene for helping others, but also the reproductive success of the other individuals who receive the help and carry the same gene (<a href=\"#bib1\">Hamilton, 1964</a>)."

Multiple matings of the queen would reduce the relatedness of individuals in the colony, and hence would reduce the inclusive fitness of the genes that cause sterility. Now, in eLife, Jason Olejarz, Benjamin Allen, Carl Veller and Nowak show that this need not be the case (<a href=\"#bib7\">Olejarz et al., 2015</a>)."

The new results show that monandry is not necessary for the evolution of non-reproductive workers.\u00a0Moreover, under some conditions, the evolution of non-reproductive workers actually requires the queen to mate with multiple males. These apparently paradoxical results were obtained by considering the effects of the non-reproductive workers on the colony as a whole."

In ants, the evolution of eusociality has occurred in a series of major transitions, each of which is thought to mark an increase in the complexity of the female castes in ant societies (<a href=\"#bib9\">Wheeler, 1986</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib10\">Wilson, et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Khila and Abouheif, 2010</a>). The first transition gave rise to societies composed of a winged caste, consisting of the queen and male ants, and a wingless female worker caste. With the exception of wings, however, the queen and the workers are remarkably similar: the workers can mate and can lay both male and female eggs."

A third major transition occurred in only a few genera of ants (out of a total of almost 300 genera) and gave rise to sterile female workers that have completely lost their ovaries. This transition is often associated with species that are ecologically and evolutionarily successful, such as fire ants (<i>Solenopsis invicta</i>) and big-headed ants (<i>Pheidole</i>)."

Understanding how worker ants evolved to have a reduced reproductive capacity is a major challenge in biology. The right panel shows the position of a protein called Vasa (green) in oocytes from a normal queen (top) and a worker (bottom): <i>vasa</i> is a highly conserved developmental gene that specifies the germ cells in all animals and is necessary for fertility. In the normal queen oocyte the Vasa protein is correctly positioned at the posterior pole of the oocyte (white arrowhead). However, in many worker oocytes the Vasa protein (white star) is not in the correct position, and this leads to developmental problems, including a reduced capacity to produce viable male offspring (<a href=\"#bib4\">Khila and Abouheif, 2008</a>). The presence of this \u2018reproductive constraint\u2019 in worker ants but not in queens allows the worker ants to use their ovaries to produce eggs that can be used to feed the colony.
