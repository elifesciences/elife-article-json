Structural analyses revealed that the \u03b2-hairpin of 40S protein Rps5/uS7 protrudes into the 40S mRNA exit-channel, contacting the eIF2\u2219GTP\u2219Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> ternary complex (TC) and mRNA context nucleotides; but its importance in AUG selection was unknown. We identified substitutions in \u03b2-strand-1 and C-terminal residues of yeast Rps5 that reduced bulk initiation, conferred \u2018leaky-scanning\u2019 of AUGs; and lowered initiation fidelity by exacerbating the effect of poor context of the eIF1 AUG codon to reduce eIF1 abundance. Consistently, the \u03b2-strand-1 substitution greatly destabilized the \u2018P<sub>IN</sub>\u2019 conformation of TC binding to reconstituted 43S\u00b7mRNA complexes in vitro. Other substitutions in \u03b2-hairpin loop residues increased initiation fidelity and destabilized P<sub>IN</sub> at UUG, but not AUG start codons. We conclude that the Rps5 \u03b2-hairpin is as crucial as soluble initiation factors for efficient and accurate start codon recognition."

The first step of translation is known as initiation. Several proteins referred to as initiation factors can bind to the small subunit of the ribosome, which itself is composed of an RNA molecule and numerous proteins, and form a pre-initiation complex (or PIC for short). This complex contains a molecule called initiator tRNA that is specialized for initiation. The PIC then attaches to the mRNA and starts scanning it, searching the sequence for an AUG triplet to serve as the start codon. The sequence immediately surrounding an AUG triplet, known as the context, influences the likelihood of its selection as the start site. When the start codon is recognized by the initiator tRNA in the PIC, the complete ribosome assembles and begins to build the protein. Choosing the correct start codon is crucial to ensure that the correct protein is made from every mRNA in the cell."

However, other mutations of the hairpin structure destabilized the closed state of the PIC only at a UUG start codon. In both cases, the mutations made the PIC more likely to remain in the open conformation and continue scanning at incorrect or suboptimal start codons, making it more likely that translation begins at the correct AUG start codon."

                        "text": "Accurate identification of the translation initiation codon is critical to ensure synthesis of the correct cellular proteins. In eukaryotic cells this process generally occurs by a scanning mechanism, wherein the small (40S) ribosomal subunit first recruits initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>) in a ternary complex (TC) with eIF2-GTP in a reaction stimulated by eIFs 1, 1A, and 3. The resulting 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) attaches to the mRNA 5\u2032 end and scans the 5\u2032 UTR for an AUG, using complementarity with the anticodon of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> to identify the start codon and assemble a 48S PIC. Nucleotides immediately surrounding the AUG, particularly the \u22123 and +4 positions (referred to below as context nucleotides), also influence start codon selection. During scanning, the GTP bound to eIF2 in the TC is hydrolyzed in the 43S PIC in a manner dependent on the GTPase activating protein eIF5, but P<sub>i</sub> release is blocked by eIF1, which also impedes stable binding of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the P site. Start codon recognition triggers dissociation of eIF1 from the 40S subunit, which allows interaction between eIF5 and the C-terminal tail (CTT) of eIF1A, P<sub>i</sub> release from eIF2-GDP\u00b7P<sub>i</sub>, and more stable TC binding in the P site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Subsequent dissociation of eIF2-GDP and other eIFs from the 48S PIC enables eIF5B-catalyzed subunit joining and formation of an 80S initiation complex with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> base-paired to AUG in the P site (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib20\">Hinnebusch, 2014</a>)."

(i) eIF1 and the scanning enhancer (SEs) elements in the CTT of eIF1A stabilize an open conformation of the 40S subunit to which the TC loads rapidly. (ii) The 43S PIC in the open conformation scans the mRNA for the start codon with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> bound in the P<sub>OUT</sub> state. The GAP domain in the N-terminal domain of eIF5 (5N) stimulates GTP hydrolysis by the TC to produce GDP\u2022Pi, but release of P<sub>i</sub> is blocked. The unstructured NTT of eIF2\u03b2 interacts with eIF1 to stabilize eIF1\u202240S association and the open conformation. (iii) On AUG recognition, Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> moves from the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> state, clashing with eIF1 and the CTT of eIF1A. Movement of eIF1 and the eIF1A CTT away from the P site disrupts eIF1's interaction with eIF2\u03b2-NTT, and the latter interacts with the eIF5-CTD. eIF1 dissociates from the 40S subunit, and the eIF5-NTD disengages from eIF2 and interacts with the eIF1A CTT instead, dependent on the SE elements, thereby facilitating P<sub>i</sub> release from eIF2. The eIF5-CTD moves into the position on the 40S subunit previously occupied by eIF1 and blocks reassociation of eIF1. (Below) Arrows summarize that eIF1 and the eIF1A SE elements promote P<sub>OUT</sub> and block transition to the P<sub>IN</sub> state, whereas the scanning inhibitor (SI) element in the NTT of eIF1A stabilizes the P<sub>IN</sub> state.

                        "text": "eIF1 plays a dual role in the scanning mechanism. It promotes an open, scanning-conducive conformation of the PIC (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002</a>) to which TC rapidly loads, bound in a state capable of inspecting successive triplets entering the P site (dubbed P<sub>OUT</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Passmore et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Saini et al., 2010</a>); and it also blocks recognition of near-cognate start codons (e.g., UUG) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yoon and Donahue, 1992</a>) and AUG codons in poor sequence context (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002</a>). Hence, eIF1 must dissociate from the 40S subunit (<a href=\"#bib30\">Maag et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cheung et al., 2007</a>) to allow P<sub>i</sub> release (<a href=\"#bib2\">Algire et al., 2005</a>) and rearrangement to a scanning-incompatible state with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> base paired with AUG and more tightly bound in the P<sub>IN</sub> conformation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Passmore et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Saini et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with this, structural analyses of different PICs reveal that eIF1 and eIF1A promote rotation of the 40S head relative to the body (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lomakin and Steitz, 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hussain et al., 2014</a>), which is likely instrumental in TC binding in the P<sub>OUT</sub> conformation, but that eIF1 physically obstructs Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> binding in the P<sub>IN</sub> state (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rabl et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lomakin and Steitz, 2013</a>). Accordingly, eIF1 is deformed and displaced from its 40S location in the open complex during the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> transition (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hussain et al., 2014</a>). Consequently, mutations that weaken eIF1 binding to the 40S subunit reduce the rate of TC loading, while elevating initiation at near-cognate codons or AUGs in poor context, by destabilizing the open/P<sub>OUT</sub> conformation and favoring rearrangement to the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> state during scanning (<a href=\"#bib31\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2013</a>). Moreover, decreasing wild-type (WT) eIF1 abundance reduces initiation accuracy, whereas overexpressing eIF1 suppresses initiation at near cognates or AUGs in poor context (<a href=\"#bib43\">Valasek et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alone et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ivanov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Saini et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</a>). This tight link between eIF1 abundance and initiation accuracy is exploited to autoregulate eIF1 expression, as the AUG start codon of the eIF1 gene (<i>SUI1</i> in yeast) occurs in poor context\u2014a feature conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution\u2014and the frequency of recognizing its own start codon is inversely related to eIF1 abundance (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ivanov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</a>)."

It is possible that favorable context also contributes to the stability of P<sub>IN</sub> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pisarev et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</a>), but the stimulatory effect of optimum context on initiation rate is not understood at the molecular level. There is evidence that the context nucleotides are recognized by the \u03b1-subunit of eIF2, as replacement of heterotrimeric eIF2 with the eIF2\u03b2\u03b3 heterodimer reduced the efficiency of AUG recognition and diminished the stimulatory effect of optimum context on 48S PIC assembly in a reconstituted mammalian system (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pisarev et al., 2006</a>).

Substituting Glu-144 (E144) in \u03b2-strand 1 of the hairpin, or the proximal C-terminal residue R225 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), confers a marked reduction in the efficiency of AUG recognition.

Analysis in the yeast reconstituted system reveals striking destabilization of the P<sub>IN</sub> state formed at AUG codons by E144R mutant 40S subunits. Substitutions in the loop portion of the Rps5 \u03b2-hairpin also destabilize the P<sub>IN</sub> state, but produce this effect selectively for near-cognate UUG start codons, and thereby dampen UUG initiation in vivo.

Accordingly, it appears that the <i>rps5</i> mutations evoke a pronounced defect in recognition of the native <i>SUI1</i> AUG codon that prevails even at low cellular concentrations of eIF1 that would normally boost <i>SUI1</i> translation."

We next asked whether they also decrease recognition of an upstream AUG codon and allow leaky scanning to the downstream ORF. A <i>GCN4-lacZ</i> reporter was employed with a modified version of upstream ORF1 that is elongated to overlap the <i>GCN4</i> ORF (el.uORF1). This construct is ideally suited for this query because virtually all scanning ribosomes normally recognize the uORF1 AUG (uAUG-1), and reinitiation at the downstream AUG of the <i>GCN4</i> main ORF following termination of el.uORF1 translation is almost non-existent, so that translation of the main ORF is extremely low (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grant et al., 1994</a>). Remarkably, <i>rps5-E144R</i> confers a dramatic increase in leaky scanning through el.uORF1, elevating <i>GCN4-lacZ</i> expression by 20-fold for the construct containing optimum context (<sup>\u22123</sup>AAA<sup>\u22121</sup>) at uAUG-1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, row 1, WT vs <i>E144R</i>). This effect is nearly comparable to the \u223c40-fold increase in leaky scanning seen in WT cells for the extremely weak uAUG-1 context of <sup>\u22123</sup>UUU<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, WT, row 5 vs row 1). <i>rps5-E144R</i> also evokes a large \u223c10-fold increase in leaky scanning for the el.uORF1 construct with the uAUG-1 context of intermediate strength (<sup>\u22123</sup>UAA<sup>\u22121</sup>), but only a \u223cfourfold increase with the weakest context of <sup>\u22123</sup>UUU<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, rows 3 and 5, WT vs <i>E144R</i>). Expression of the construct lacking uAUG-1 is not significantly affected by <i>rps5-E144R</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, row 7, WT vs <i>E144R</i>), consistent with leaky scanning being the source of elevated <i>GCN4-lacZ</i> expression for the various el.uORF1 constructs. The <i>R225K</i> mutation also increases leaky scanning of uAUG-1, but to a lesser degree: 3.5-fold for <sup>\u22123</sup>AAA<sup>\u22121</sup>, 3.3-fold for <sup>\u22123</sup>UAA<sup>\u22121</sup>, and 1.7-fold for <sup>\u22123</sup>UUU<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, rows 1, 3, 5; WT vs <i>R225K</i>). The increases in leaky scanning conferred by the <i>rps5</i> mutations were relatively unaffected by the restoration of WT eIF1 levels by introducing sc<i>SUI1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, rows 2, 4, 6 vs 1, 3, 5, respectively)<i>.</i> This was anticipated because the reduced levels of eIF1 in the <i>rps5</i> mutants (lacking <i>scSUI1</i>) would not be expected to reduce uAUG-1 recognition and confer leaky scanning, as decreased eIF1 abundance is associated with increased start codon recognition (at least for near-cognate start codons or AUG codons in poor context) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ivanov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</a>).

In the absence of mRNA, the affinities for TC are similar between 43S PICs assembled with mutant or WT 40S subunits (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>); however, the endpoint of the reaction is markedly reduced for the <i>E144R</i> complexes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). It was previously proposed that the endpoints of TC binding reactions achieved at saturating 40S concentrations reflect the distribution of PICs between open and closed states. The open state was assumed to be unstable during electrophoresis, and thus could not be visualized, leading to endpoints of &lt;1 (measured as fractions of TC bound to 40S complexes) for reactions using mRNA lacking an AUG codon (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kapp et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kolitz et al., 2009</a>), or tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> mutants (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dong et al., 2014</a>), in which the open complex is favored over the closed state. Hence, the reduced endpoint seen in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> suggests that the closed state of 43S complexes formed with <i>E144R</i> mutant ribosomes is unstable and rearranges to the less stable, open conformation during electrophoresis. This interpretation supports the hypothesis that <i>E144R</i> destabilizes the closed state of the PIC."

In agreement with previous findings (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kolitz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dong et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2014</a>), TC dissociates very little from WT PICs formed with mRNA(AUG) over the time course of the experiment, yielding a rate constant of only 0.05 hr<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; summarized in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). By contrast, TC dissociation from WT PICs assembled on an otherwise identical mRNA containing a UUG start codon is \u223csevenfold faster (k<sub>off</sub> = 0.34 hr<sup>\u22121</sup>), reflecting the reduced stability of the P<sub>IN</sub> state at this near-cognate start codon (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kolitz et al., 2009</a>). Remarkably, for 43S\u2219mRNA(AUG) complexes assembled with <i>E144R</i> 40S subunits, the dissociation rate was increased \u223c36-fold compared to that seen for the corresponding WT complexes (from 0.05 hr<sup>\u22121</sup> to 1.8 hr<sup>\u22121</sup>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,F</a>). An even larger increase in k<sub>off</sub> of \u223c130-fold was measured for mRNA(UUG) complexes assembled with <i>E144R</i> vs WT 40S subunits (\u226546 hr<sup>\u22121</sup> vs 0.34 hr<sup>\u22121</sup>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,F</a>). These findings provide strong biochemical evidence that <i>E144R</i> destabilizes P<sub>IN</sub> at both AUG and UUG start codons with a relatively stronger effect on the near-cognate triplet, which coincides with the in vivo effects of <i>E144R</i> of reducing recognition of the <i>SUI1</i> AUG and <i>GCN4</i> uAUG-1 start codons, and of suppressing UUG initiation on <i>his4-301</i> mRNA."

To support this conclusion, we repeated the k<sub>off</sub> measurements using eIF2 harboring the Sui<sup>\u2212</sup> substitution in eIF2\u03b2 encoded by <i>SUI3-2</i> (S264Y). Consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib33\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2014</a>), in reactions with WT 40S subunits, <i>SUI3-2</i> eliminates detectable TC dissociation from AUG complexes and also delays TC dissociation from UUG complexes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>) compared to that seen using WT eIF2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), thus decreasing the k<sub>off</sub> for UUG complexes by \u223cthreefold (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>; WT eIF2\u03b2 vs eIF2\u03b2-S264Y, WT <i>RPS5,</i> UUG complexes).

However, this interpretation would overlook the fact that it is impossible to detect an increase in leaky scanning of uAUG-1 in poor context by 20-fold, as only a \u223cthreefold reduction in its recognition yields <i>GCN4-lacZ</i> expression essentially indistinguishable from that seen in the absence of uAUG-1 itself (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, cf. constructs <span class=\"underline\">UUU</span>AUG vs AAA<span class=\"underline\">AGC</span> in WT cells).

However, one distinctive feature of WT uORF1 and the elongated el.uORF1 contained in our leaky scanning reporter is the absence of typical coding sequences 3\u2032 of the uAUG-1 start codon. WT uORF1 is only 3 codons long, and much of el.uORF1 is derived from non-translated triplets that normally reside between uORF4 and the <i>GCN4</i> coding sequence. This region has a relatively low propensity for secondary structure (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kertesz et al., 2010</a>), which might enable elongating ribosomes to clear the initiation region more rapidly than occurs with more typical coding sequences. In fact, the properties of the leaky scanning reporter insure that the increases in <i>GCN4-lacZ</i> expression observed in the Rps5 mutants reflect diminished recognition of uAUG-1 relative to the main ORF start codon by scanning PICs. Considering that the <i>rps5</i> mutations appear to have no effect on recognition of the main ORF AUG in the <i>GCN4-lacZ</i> construct lacking el.uORF1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, row 7), the presence of greater secondary structure in the main ORF could reduce the rate of scanning through the initiation region to promote start codon recognition in a way that would be lacking at the el.uORF1 start codon. If elongating ribosomes located in the initiation region can enhance initiation by this mechanism, this could compensate for the reduction in P<sub>IN</sub> stability conferred by <i>E144R</i> and <i>R225K</i> for the <i>SUI1</i> and <i>GCN4</i> initiation regions in a way that would not occur for el.uORF1, making the latter sensitive to the destabilizing effects of these mutations even with optimum context present. Consistent with this scenario, it was shown recently that the presence of slowly-translated codons near the AUG codon can affect the initiation rate in yeast cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chu et al., 2014</a>). Thus, it seems plausible that <i>E144R</i> and <i>R225K</i> decrease the efficiency of start codon recognition only for weak initiation sites, including near-cognate UUG codons and sub-optimal AUG start sites, without reducing recognition of AUG codons in strong context that initiate structured coding sequences."

Consistent with this, an exemplar of such mutations, <i>rps5-R148E</i>, specifically destabilized the P<sub>IN</sub> state formed at UUG, but not AUG, start codons in reconstituted PICs in vitro. The Rps5 loop substitutions do not discriminate against the weak context of the <i>SUI1</i> AUG codon, nor increase leaky scanning of el.uORF1 even when uAUG-1 resides in poor context, and thus exclusively destabilize PICs lacking a cognate (AUG) start codon. They differ from previously described Ssu<sup>\u2212</sup> substitutions in eIF1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</a>) in that the Rps5 substitutions efficiently suppress UUG initiation but do not discriminate against the poor context of the native <i>SUI1</i> AUG codon. This distinction might be explained by noting that eIF1 is the principal \u2018gate-keeper\u2019 that blocks utilization of weak initiation sites (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hinnebusch, 2014</a>). As the eIF1 Ssu<sup>\u2212</sup> substitutions delay eIF1 release from the 40S subunit on start codon recognition (<a href=\"#bib32\">Martin-Marcos et al., 2013</a>), they might discriminate more broadly against unstable PICs regardless of whether they lack strong context or a perfect codon:anticodon duplex in the P site. Our Rps5 loop substitutions, by contrast, appear to have a more nuanced effect that destabilizes P<sub>IN</sub> only when a mismatch occurs in the codon:anticodon duplex itself. As summarized in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, our results indicate that both E144 and R148 promote start codon selection by stabilizing the P<sub>IN</sub> state, and the finding that <i>E144R</i> reduces initiation at both UUG and sub-optimal AUG codons, while R148E impairs only UUG recognition, can be explained as the result of a relatively stronger contribution of E144 vs R148 to the stability of the P<sub>IN</sub> state."

The proximity of the hairpin loop to the E site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) suggests a disruption of Rps5 contacts with the context nucleotides in mRNA. Indeed, R156 in the loop interacts with the backbone of rRNA helix 23, which in turn contacts the \u22123 context nucleotide (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hussain et al., 2014</a>). If this interaction promotes the P<sub>IN</sub> state, it would help explain why loop residue substitutions impair recognition of UUG start codons (Ssu<sup>\u2212</sup> phenotype). However, except for the lethal substitution G151S, all of the substitutions affecting loop residues we examined\u2014G151 through Q158\u2014have weaker phenotypes compared to the E144R substitution in \u03b2-strand 1 of the hairpin itself, distant from the context nucleotides. Thus, perhaps structural alteration of the \u03b2-hairpin by E144R indirectly perturbs the conformation of the N-terminal tail of yeast Rps5, which promotes AUG recognition by its interaction with Rps16/uS9 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ghosh et al., 2014</a>), whose C-terminal tail closely approaches the codon-anticodon duplex in the P site (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hussain et al., 2014</a>). Alternatively, E144R might affect the conformation or location of ribosomal proteins Rps28 and Rps14, also located in the exit channel and in contact with the Rps5 \u03b2-hairpin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hussain et al., 2014</a>), or of domain 1 of eIF2\u03b1, which interacts with other regions of Rps5 as well as Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the P<sub>IN</sub> complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In these latter scenarios, the inherent flexibility of the Rps5 hairpin loop could prevent loop substitutions from altering the orientation of the \u03b2-hairpin and attendant perturbations within the PIC compared to effects exerted by <i>E144R</i> or <i>R225K</i> on the structured portion of the hairpin."

In bacterial elongation complexes, the hairpin is also in proximity to E-site tRNA, and truncation of the hairpin increases the frequency of frameshifting, most likely by allowing premature dissociation of the E-site tRNA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Devaraj et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, in the yeast py48S PIC, eIF2\u03b1-D1 essentially occupies the position of E-site tRNA (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hussain et al., 2014</a>), in accordance with our suggestion that altering the \u03b2-hairpin of yeast uS7/Rps5 could impair start codon selection by perturbing the position or flexibility of eIF2\u03b1-D1. Regardless of the exact mechanisms involved, the strong impairment of AUG recognition in vivo and marked destabilization of the P<sub>IN</sub> state in vitro conferred by <i>E144R</i> dramatically illustrates that a 40S ribosomal protein functions as an equal partner with soluble initiation factors in ensuring efficient and accurate start codon recognition."

Because initiator Met-tRNAMet is expected to form less than three standard base-pairs with this codon, an initiation complex assembled on mRNA with UUG, a priori, is less stable than the complex formed on the AUG codon with complete three base-pairs. Consequently, the results describing, for example, dissociation of the initiation complexes assembled on the UUG codon can be exaggerated because inherently unstable complexes additionally fall apart owing to the experimental procedure (viz. electrophoresis during 45 min). Hence, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> shows that the initiation complex assembled on the UUG codon with the wild type 40S is very weak compared to the stable complex on the AUG codon. In this regard, it would be more correct to describe relative effects rather than provide exact values of constants. Since the Y-axis of most of the graphs is presented in arbitrary units, it would be also very helpful to show actual dmp/cpm values to demonstrate efficiency of signals and their differences."

Previous studies have shown that <i>rps5</i> contacts the nucleotide at the -3 position (5' to the AUG start codon), which may suggest that rps5 affects start codon selection or fidelity. This manuscript examines the role of <i>rps5</i> on start codon recognition, both for recognition of the AUG and for the sequence context of the AUG. Their findings revealed that mutations in <i>rps5</i> resulted in a decrease in AUG recognition for start codons that were not in the optimal sequence context. As a result of this expression levels of eIF1, which uses a suboptimal start codon context to regulate its gene expression, are lower. When eIF1 levels were increased by expressing eIF1 from a plasmid, initiation at UUG returned to wild-type levels suggesting that the decrease in eIF1 is responsible for the increase in UUG initiation and not the <i>rps5</i> mutants. However, there must be some additional effect of <i>rps5</i> on UUG initiation since it was able to suppress UUG recognition in a yeast strain that harbored an eIF5 mutation that increased UUG initiation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). The authors used binding studies to examine the affinity of the ternary complex bound to the Wild-type and <i>rps5</i> mutant 40S ribosomes. They show that the mutant <i>rps5</i> destabilizes the PIN/closed state. Interestingly, the transition from POUT to PIN is not affected, however, the stability of the PIN complexes is decreased for the <i>rps5</i> mutant ribosomes. Overall the findings are interesting and significant in that they suggest a novel role for <i>rps5</i> in start codon recognition, but the manuscript was a bit difficult to understand and it would benefit from additional clarifications and simplifications. Please see the following comments."

However, it does appear that while the <i>rps5</i> mutants confer reduced initiation at start codons in a poor or week context that they may not enhance initiation in a favorable context. Could it be possible that a general decrease in frequency of start codon recognition could just have a much greater effect on the weaker or poor context AUGs and relatively less on the AUG in a good sequence context? Would this explain all the data, the binding studies showing reduced complex formation, the decrease in UUG initiation, and <i>SUI1</i> initiation? As the manuscript reads it appears that there are more than one model/mechanism for how <i>rps5</i> is affecting translation initiation depending on which reporter or assay is used. For example, when ribosomes with <i>rps5</i> mutations don't recognize the <i>GCN4</i> uAUG it is promoting leaky scanning, but when it doesn't recognize the <i>SUI1</i> or UUG it is hyperaccurate."

(2009)</a>, using single and double substitutions in the mRNA start codon to investigate the effects of base-pair mismatches with initiator tRNA on the rates of TC association and dissociation from 43S\u00b7mRNA complexes. They found that when UUG replaces AUG in the mRNA, the rate constant for TC binding (k<sub>on</sub>) was reduced by \u223c40%, while the dissociation rate constant (k<sub>off</sub>) was increased \u223c4-fold, to yield an increase in K<sub>d</sub> of \u223c7-fold. Thus, the referee is correct in stating that the UUG complex is inherently less stable than the AUG complex; however, this difference is the key feature of this assay that allows us to discern relatively greater effects of Ssu<sup>-</sup> mutations on UUG versus AUG complexes. Based on the measured K<sub>d</sub> values in <a href=\"#bib27\">Kolitz et al. (2009)</a>, UUG is the near-cognate closest to AUG in forming a stable PIC. With WT ribosomes, the UUG complexes are still quite stable, with &lt;20% dissociating in the first hour of incubation; and even less dissociation occurs when the \u00df-S264Y variant of eIF2 is employed, as done in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a> where the destabilizing effect of <i>R148E</i> on UUG complexes was established. Note also that the key conclusion that <i>E144R</i> destabilizes the PIC derives in large part from its effect of increasing the k<sub>off</sub> for the highly stable AUG complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Dissociation of the UUG complexes during electrophoresis is not an issue because this would occur equally for all of the time points in the assay, including the zero-time point from which dissociation during the incubation is measured as a function of time. This assay has been used in several previous papers that we published in collaboration with the Lorsch lab, including the analysis of Sui<sup>-</sup> and Ssu<sup>-</sup> mutations in initiator tRNA (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dong et al., 2014</a>), and of eIF1 Ssu<sup>-</sup> mutations by <a href=\"#bib33\">Martin-Marcos et al.

Could it be possible that a general decrease in frequency of start codon recognition could just have a much greater effect on the weaker or poor context AUGs and relatively less on the AUG in a good sequence context? Would this explain all the data, the binding studies showing reduced complex formation, the decrease in UUG initiation, and</i> SUI1 <i>initiation?

We agree with his/her interpretation and had actually laid the groundwork for advancing it as a likely scenario with the text in the second and third paragraphs of the Discussion that seeks to explain the increased leaky scanning observed for uAUG-1 in optimum context as the result of el.uORF1 being unstructured. However, at the end, we failed to propose this explanation explicitly. To rectify this, we added the following sentence: \u201cThus, it seems plausible that <i>E144R</i> and <i>R225K</i> decrease the efficiency of start codon recognition only for weak initiation sites, including near-cognate UUG codons and sub-optimal AUG start sites, without reducing recognition of AUG codons in strong context that initiate structured coding sequences.\u201d And later in the Discussion we state: \u201cAs summarized in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, our results indicate that both E144 and R148 promote start codon selection by stabilizing the P<sub>IN</sub> state, and the finding that <i>E144R</i> reduces initiation at both UUG and sub-optimal AUG codons, while <i>R148E</i> impairs only UUG recognition, can be explained as the result of a relatively stronger contribution of E144 versus R148 to the stability of the P<sub>IN</sub> state\u201d."

Briefly, we suggested a disruption of the interaction of hairpin loop residues with the rRNA residue in close proximity to the -3 context nucleotide, perturbation of the hairpin interaction with Rps16 whose CTT closely approaches the codon-anticodon duplex in the P-site, and altering the interaction with domain-1 of eIF2\u03b1 that interacts with both tRNA<sub>i</sub> and the mRNA 5\u2019 of the start codon. We now suggest that this last mechanism would be analogous to the role of the orthologous hairpin in bacterial S7 in stabilizing the E-site tRNA during elongation, as eIF2\u03b1-D1 and E-site tRNA occupy very similar positions."

Despite this, the increase in eIF1 levels in the mutants achieved with <i>scSUI1</i> is sufficient to restore the elevated UUG/AUG ratio to the WT level (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This demonstrates that elevated UUG initiation is an indirect consequence of low eIF1 levels in the mutants, which is the main point of this experiment. The fact that the eIF1 levels in the mutants harboring <i>scSUI1</i> remain well below those seen in the corresponding WT/<i>scSUI1</i> transformant (lanes 3-4 &amp; 7-8 vs. 11-12) indicates that enhanced discrimination against the poor context of native <i>SUI1</i> still occurs in the mutants at the boosted levels of eIF1. Similarly, we show later in the paper that the increased leaky scanning of <i>GCN4</i> uAUG-1 in the mutants is not diminished by increasing eIF1 levels with <i>scSUI1</i>. Thus, we think it is clear that the defects in AUG recognition, whether for the native <i>SUI1</i> AUG or <i>GCN4</i> uAUG-1, do not arise from the reduced eIF1 levels in the mutants. In fact, because eIF1 promotes scanning, reduced eIF1 levels per se should diminish discrimination against the poor context of SU1I and boost eIF1 levels; and if anything, should reduce, not increase, leaky scanning of uAUG-1."
