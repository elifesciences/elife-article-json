Cohesin contains a heterodimeric ATP-binding Cassette (ABC) ATPase comprised of Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase active sites. These ATPases are required for cohesin to bind DNA. Cohesin\u2019s DNA binding activity is also promoted by the Eco1 acetyltransferase and inhibited by Wpl1. Recently we showed that after cohesin stably binds DNA, a second step is required for DNA tethering. This second step is also controlled by Eco1 acetylation. Here, we use genetic and biochemical analyses to show that this second DNA tethering step is regulated by cohesin ATPase. Furthermore, our results also suggest that Eco1 promotes cohesion by modulating the ATPase cycle of DNA-bound cohesin in a state that is permissive for DNA tethering and refractory to Wpl1 inhibition."

These chromosomes must be duplicated and the copies need to be segregated every time cells divide. Cohesin is a protein complex that helps to organize the structure of chromosomes by tethering together two regions of DNA, either within a chromosome or between chromosomes. Problems with cohesin have been linked to cancer and birth defects, but it is not clear how cohesin binds DNA and how it makes a tether between two DNA regions. It is also unclear how cohesin\u2019s activity is coordinated with the series of events that allow cells to divide (known as the cell cycle)."

The experiments, which involved a combination of genetic, cell biology and biochemical techniques in budding yeast, instead revealed that one of cohesin\u2019s ATPases regulates structural rearrangements in cohesin that is already bound to DNA. These structural rearrangements fine-tune the complex\u2019s ability to tether two regions of DNA."

Cohesin is an SMC complex that was first identified as being essential for sister chromatid cohesion, the process of holding together the sister chromatids from their synthesis in S phase until their segregation in anaphase (<a href=\"#bib12\">Guacci et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Michaelis et al., 1997</a>). Cohesin is also involved in mitotic condensation, meiotic chromosome condensation and structure, post-replicative DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Onn et al., 2008</a>). Cohesin performs these different functions by tethering together two regions of DNA, either within a single DNA molecule (condensation and regulation of gene expression) or between two DNA molecules (sister chromatid cohesion and DNA repair). How cohesin-mediated DNA tethering is regulated is one of the critical unanswered questions in the field."

Cohesin appears to topologically entrap DNA through its ring-like architecture that results from the assembly of its four core subunits, Smc1, Smc3, Mcd1/Scc1, and Scc3/Irr1 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nasmyth and Haering, 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Cohesin\u2019s ATPase domain is composed of two ATPase active sites each containing four conserved motifs: Walker A, Walker B, signature motif, and D-loop. The Smc1 ATPase active site is a hybrid site containing the Walker A and Walker B motif\ufeffs encoded by Smc1,\u00a0and the D-loop and signature motifs encoded by Smc3. Likewise, the Smc3 ATPase active site contains the Smc3-encoded Walker A and Walker B motifs, and Smc1-encoded D-loop and signature motifs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arumugam et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Haering et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hopfner et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> inset). Characterization of mutations that block ATP binding (Walker A) or hydrolysis (Walker B) suggest that ATP binding and hydrolysis by both ATPases are necessary for the DNA binding of cohesin (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arumugam et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2010b</a>). Cohesin\u2019s ATPase activity is also stimulated by the Scc2/Scc4 complex (<a href=\"#bib28\">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</a>), which is required for the DNA binding of cohesin in vivo (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ciosk et al., 2000</a>). These observations led to the hypothesis that Scc2/Scc4 complex stimulates ATP hydrolysis to open the cohesin ring and allow the entry of DNA. Subsequent ATP binding closes the ring, entrapping the DNA (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arumugam et al., 2003</a>). Presumably, in order for cohesin to remain stably bound to DNA, its ATPase activity would have to be suppressed to prevent ring reopening and DNA escape. However, the ATPase activity of cohesin in its stable DNA-bound form had never been determined."

(<b>B</b>) Schematic showing in vitro assembly of stable cohesin-DNA bead complexes. DNA bearing <i>CARC1</i> sequence was attached to dynabeads via biotin-streptavidin interaction at both ends. Cohesin was incubated with bead-bound DNA and loader in buffer containing 25 mM KCl and 25 mM NaCl, then washed in 500 mM KCl to wash off salt-sensitive cohesin. The remaining DNA-bound cohesin (and small amount of loader) is referred to as cohesin-DNA-beads (CD-B). (<b>C</b>) Cohesin assembly on DNA-beads. <i>S. pombe</i> cohesin and loader complexes were purified from Y4443 and Y4483, respectively. Purified cohesin and loader were incubated with dynabeads-DNA or dynabeads alone for 1 hour at 30\u00b0C, then cohesin was washed off as described in B. Cohesin bound DNA-beads (DNA) but failed to bind beads lacking DNA (-). (<b>D</b>) Cohesin binding to DNA is stimulated by the loader complex. DNA binding was done as described in B &amp; C, except loader was omitted in one sample. Percent cohesin bound was calculated by quantifying bands on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Data from two independent experiments, error bars represent standard deviation. (<b>E</b>) Effect of stable DNA binding on cohesin ATPase activity. ATPase activity of cohesin alone (2) was compared to cohesin with DNA (3), cohesin in presence of loader complex and DNA (4), and cohesin in stable cohesin-DNA complexes (CD-B, 5). Proteins were incubated in ATPase buffer 2 spiked with hot ATP for 1 hour at 30\u00b0C. Released Pi was calculated and plotted as described in Methods. Error bars represent standard deviation from two independent experiments. (<b>F</b>) Equal concentrations of cohesin were used in the ATPase reactions. Arrows point to <i>S. pombe</i> homologs of cohesin subunits, Smc1, Smc3 (Psm1 and Psm3 in <i>S. pombe</i>, ~150 kD), Mcd1 and Scc3 (Rad21 and Psc3 in <i>S. pombe</i>, ~100 kD). Asterisks mark subunits of the <i>S. pombe</i> homolog of the loader complex, Scc2/Scc4 (Mis4/Ssl3 in <i>S. pombe</i>). Due to the lower ability of the loader complex to bind to DNA under these conditions, there is less loader complex present in sample 5 than in sample 4. (<b>G</b>) Stably DNA bound cohesin remained bound to DNA-beads throughout the course of the ATPase experiment. Cohesin was incubated with DNA-beads in the presence of loader and ATP as described before and washed in 0.5 M KCl, then resuspended in ATPase buffer. Samples were incubated for 1 hour at 30\u00b0C. Supernatant and beads were separated and visualized on SDS-PAGE. Protein gels are representative of at least 2 independent experiments.

Together, these data strongly argue that cohesion is a two-step process: First, cohesin associates with DNA in a stable form. Then, cohesin undergoes a second transition to tether sister chromatids together. This transition could entail conformational changes involving oligomerization (<a href=\"#bib7\">Eng et al., 2015</a>), or the activation of a second, independent DNA binding activity through rearrangements of the coiled coils (<a href=\"#bib36\">Soh et al., 2015</a>)."

However, this observation does not preclude a specialized role for the Smc3 ATPase active site in regulating DNA tethering after DNA binding. Indeed, the acetylated K112 and K113 residues in Smc3 are proximal to the Smc3 ATPase active site (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gligoris et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Haering et al., 2004</a>). Moreover, a recently identified suppressor mutation located near the Smc3 ATPase active site bypasses the requirement for Smc3 acetylation in cohesion establishment (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guacci et al., 2015</a>).

We characterize an Smc3 ATPase active site mutant in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> that bypasses the requirement for Eco1 acetylation in cohesion generation, and uncouples the level of ATPase activity from cohesin\u2019s DNA binding and tethering activities. We propose that cohesin\u2019s ATPase has two distinct functions in regulating DNA binding and subsequent DNA tethering.

These models predict that stably DNA-bound cohesin should not show ATPase activity. However, recent literature suggests that Eco1 might promote cohesion by regulating the cohesin ATPase after the stable DNA binding of cohesin. If ATPase activity is required to regulate this second step of cohesion establishment, we should be able to observe ATPase activity for purified cohesin-DNA complexes. To test this possibility, we purified <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe c</i>ohesin and loader complexes as described previously (<a href=\"#bib28\">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</a>). Purified cohesin showed basal ATPase activity that was stimulated by the presence of the loader complex and DNA, and abolished by a Walker A mutation in Smc3 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), similar to published results (<a href=\"#bib28\">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</a>). Cohesin binding to chromosomes in vivo is enriched at centromeres and at cohesion-associated regions (CARs) along the chromosome arms (<a href=\"#bib25\">Laloraya et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Onn et al., 2008</a>), and is highly salt resistant (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ciosk et al., 2000</a>). To purify stable cohesin-DNA complexes that are physiologically relevant, we assembled cohesin on DNA molecules that contained <i>CARC1</i> sequence and were coupled by both ends to dynabeads. Cohesin and its loader were incubated with DNA-beads under low salt conditions (25 mM KCl, 25 mM NaCl). The cohesin-DNA bead mix was washed with high salt (500 mM KCl) to remove any free cohesin or cohesin not stably bound to DNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The cohesin that remained bound to the DNA-beads was then eluted and quantified by Coomassie staining or Western blots. In the presence of the loader, 20% of the input cohesin was bound to DNA-beads after the high salt wash (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). In the absence of the loader, 2-fold less cohesin bound to DNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Cohesin did not bind to beads that lack DNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In addition, this stable population of cohesin on DNA-beads could be eluted from the beads by either a restriction enzyme digest or a DNase treatment (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results suggest that cohesin bound specifically to the DNA that was coupled to beads, and did so in a salt-resistant and loader-inducible manner. These DNA binding features recapitulated the properties of stable cohesin-DNA complexes assembled in vivo (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ciosk et al., 2000</a>)."

DNA-beads were incubated with cohesin and loader, then washed with high salt buffer to remove free and unstably bound cohesin, as described above. Cohesin-DNA beads (CD-B) were then resuspended in buffer containing ATP to measure ATPase activity of CD-B, compared to basal and loader/DNA-stimulated activities of cohesin. No ATPase activity was detected when cohesin was omitted from the reaction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As shown before (<a href=\"#bib28\">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</a>), cohesin\u2019s basal ATPase activity (sample 2) was stimulated about 3-fold by the presence of loader and DNA (sample 4), but only subtly increased by DNA alone (sample 3, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Our purified cohesin-DNA complexes on beads (CD-B, sample 5) showed about 4-fold increased ATPase activity compared to the basal activity of equal amounts of cohesin (sample 2, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). Furthermore, the ATPase activity of CD-B was at least as high, if not higher, as the activity of equal concentrations of loader/DNA-stimulated cohesin in solution, where additional rounds of cohesin loading were possible (sample 4 compared to sample 5, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>)."

To test this possibility, a parallel sample of CD-B was treated similarly to the ATPase assay to assess the amount of cohesin that remained bound to DNA through the course of the ATPase experiment. DNA-beads were separated from the supernatant after the 30-minute incubation with ATP and the amount of cohesin in each fraction was visualized by SDS-PAGE. Very little, if any, cohesin was found in the supernatant at the end of the incubation, suggesting that most of the ATPase activity was derived from cohesin bound to the DNA-beads (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Even in the presence of excess competitor DNA in solution, cohesin remained\u00a0stably bound to the\u00a0DNA-beads (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Given that the loader complex stimulates cohesin\u2019s ATPase activity in the presence of DNA, it was possible that the ATPase activity in our purified cohesin-DNA complexes depended upon the presence of the loader complex. To test this possibility, we repeated these experiments but omitted the loader from the binding reaction. Under these conditions, a smaller percentage of cohesin could be assembled on DNA in a salt-resistant manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Cohesin in these purified cohesin-DNA complexes that have no co-purifying loader complex also retained ATPase activity equivalent to that seen in the mixture of cohesin and DNA in solution (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Thus, the persistence of ATPase activity in stable cohesin-DNA complexes was not dependent upon the loader. The presence of cohesin\u2019s ATPase activity in the stable cohesin-DNA complex is consistent with a regulatory role for cohesin ATPase in cohesion establishment in vivo after cohesin stably binds to DNA."

We postulated that this failure to generate cohesion was due to a misregulation of the cohesin ATPase active sites. If so, a subset of mutations altering the Smc1 or Smc3 ATPase active sites might mimic the state of the ATPase upon Eco1 acetylation, and thereby might suppress the cohesion defect of <i>eco1</i>\u2206 <i>wpl1</i>\u2206 cells."

The reliance of <i>eco1</i>\u2206 <i>wpl1</i>\u2206 cells on this cohesin-independent segregation makes them sensitive to the microtubule depolymerizing drug benomyl. A screen for suppressors of the benomyl sensitivity of <i>eco1</i>\u2206 <i>wpl1</i>\u2206 cells should identify a subset of mutations that restore cohesion and the cohesin-dependent benomyl-resistant mechanism of segregation. Indeed, we recently reported one such benomyl-resistant suppressor allele, <i>smc3-D1189H</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guacci et al., 2015</a>), that restored cohesion. <i>smc3-D1189H</i> is located in the ATPase head domain, near the Smc3 ATPase active site.

To assay for cohesion, these cells contained a LacO array integrated at a <i>CEN</i>-proximal locus (<i>TRP1</i>), and a GFP-LacI fusion protein that bound to the array. In this assay, sister chromatids that have cohesion generate a single GFP spot, whereas chromatids lacking cohesion generate 2 GFP spots (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Wild type cells had robust cohesion as shown by few M phase cells with two GFP spots (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). <i>eco1</i>\u2206 <i>wpl1</i>\u2206\u00a0cells exhibited a severe cohesion defect (more than 60% of cells had two GFP spots), which was reduced by half by the <i>smc1-D1164E</i> suppressor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

As expected, wild type cells showed robust cohesion where very few cells had separated sisters, and <i>eco1</i>\u2206 <i>wpl1</i>\u2206\u00a0cells showed sister chromatid separation starting in S phase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), consistent with a cohesion establishment defect that was shown previously for this strain (<a href=\"#bib13\">Guacci and Koshland, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Guacci et al., 2015</a>). The small amount of cohesion loss in <i>smc1-D1164E eco1</i>\u2206 <i>wpl1</i>\u2206 cells also began during S phase, indicating that the residual cohesion defect in these cells resulted from a failure in cohesion establishment. However, these cells displayed fewer separated sisters throughout the time course compared to <i>eco1</i>\u2206 <i>wpl1</i>\u2206 cells. These results indicated that (1) <i>smc1-D1164E</i> promotes cohesion establishment in the <i>eco1\u2206 wpl1\u2206</i>, albeit incompletely, and (2) once cohesion is formed in <i>smc1-D1164E eco1</i>\u2206 <i>wpl1</i>\u2206 cells, it is maintained. <i>smc1-D1164E</i> also partially restored cohesion establishment in <i>eco1</i>\u2206 <i>wpl1</i>\u2206 cells at the <i>CEN</i>-distal locus, <i>LYS4</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

To test this prediction, we performed chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to compare cohesin binding to chromosomes in <i>eco1</i>\u2206 <i>wpl1</i>\u2206 cells containing <i>SMC1</i> or <i>smc1-D1164E</i> allele.

This similarity in chromosomal binding indicates that cohesion restoration in <i>eco1</i>\u2206 <i>wpl1</i>\u2206 cells by the <i>smc1-D1164E</i> allele was not due to an altered level of cohesin binding to chromosomes, but instead was due to a change in cohesin function at a post-DNA binding step."

To understand better how <i>smc1-D1164E,</i> and by inference the Smc3 ATPase active site, interfaced with cohesin regulators, we examined its impact on the phenotypes of <i>wpl1</i>\u2206 and <i>eco1</i>\u2206single mutants.

Alternatively, it might reflect an inherent cost of uncoupling cohesin from its regulators. To differentiate between these possibilities, we characterized the <i>smc1-D1164E</i> allele when both <i>ECO1</i> and <i>WPL1</i> were present. In plasmid shuffle assays (Materials and methods), the viability of cells containing the <i>smc1-D1164E</i> or <i>SMC1</i> alleles was indistinguishable (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

(<b>D</b>) Model for how the two ATPase active sites regulate cohesin function. Free cohesin is converted to a stable DNA-bound form by the action of the loader complex (not shown) and ATP binding/hydrolysis by ATPase active sites. A particular unknown nucleotide state at the Smc3 ATPase active site induces the tethering (cohesive) form. Upon finding the correct sister to be paired with, the Eco1-mediated acetylation of Smc3 leads to the stabilization of this cohesive state. Absent this stabilization, the Smc3 ATPase active site destabilizes the tethering form or induces cohesin dissociation from chromosomes. Wpl1 could either promote this Smc3 ATPase active site function or destabilize the cohesin bound to DNA in the non-tethering form. Figure supplement 1 shows cohesin binding to DNA in <i>smc1-D1164E</i> and <i>smc3-D1161E</i> strains."

Here, we show that cohesin retains its ATPase activity after stably binding to DNA in vitro, implying ATP hydrolysis plays an additional role(s) after cohesin binds DNA. We also show that cohesion activator mutations in key residues of the Smc3 ATPase active site, <i>smc1-D1164E</i> and <i>smc1-Y1128C</i>, suppress the severe cohesion defect of <i>eco1</i>\u2206 <i>wpl1</i>\u2206 cells, similar to the previously described <i>smc3-D1189H</i> allele (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guacci et al., 2015</a>). These cohesion activators restore cohesion in <i>eco1\u2206 wpl1\u2206</i> cells without increasing the amount of cohesin stably bound to DNA (this study, <a href=\"#bib14\">Guacci et al., 2015</a>). Lastly, a mutation analogous to one of these activator mutations, <i>smc1-D1164E</i>, abolishes most, if not all, cohesin ATPase activity when introduced in purified <i>S. pombe</i> cohesin complex. Taken together, our results suggest the robust ATPase activity of DNA-bound cohesin is physiologically relevant, likely acting as an inhibitor of the conversion of stably bound cohesin to a form capable of tethering sister chromatids."

The analogous substitution in the D-loop of the Smc1 ATPase active site, <i>smc3-D1161E,</i> not only fails to act as a cohesion activator but also is unable to support viability, fails to load cohesin to DNA, and cannot generate cohesion. These results suggest that the Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase active sites differentially affect cohesin ATPase function and that the Smc3 ATPase active site has a distinct function in the generation of cohesion after stable DNA binding of cohesin. This distinct function provides an explanation for the evolutionary diversion of the SMC subunits. Indeed, use of asymmetrical ATPases for regulation purposes is common to ABC transporters (<a href=\"#bib1\">Antony and Hingorani, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Furman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yang et al., 2003</a>). We suspect the differential roles of cohesin ATPase active sites and a specialized role for the Smc3 active site in DNA tethering was missed previously, in part due to their composite nature and the particular mutations that have been analyzed to date. How the D-loop of the Smc3 ATPase active site executes its specialized function in regulating the cohesin ATPase remains unclear. The D-loop may impact the nucleotide state only in the Smc3 ATPase active site. Alternatively, it could alter the nucleotide state of both active sites. Support for the latter comes from studies on the ABC ATPase domains in ABC transporters, which suggest that ATP hydrolysis by the two sites is cooperative (<a href=\"#bib21\">Holland and Blight, 1999</a>), and that D-loops are involved in mediating the communicat\ufeffon between the two active sites within the ATPase (<a href=\"#bib8\">Furman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hohl et al., 2012, 2014</a>)."

For example, cohesin complexes with aspartate-to-glutamate substitution in the D-loop of the Smc1 active site had significant ATPase activity in vitro, but were severely perturbed for DNA binding in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. In addition, cohesin complexes with aspartate-to-glutamate substitution in the D-loop of the Smc3 ATPase had low levels of ATPase activity indistinguishable from the walker A mutant, but could promote DNA binding and cohesion in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. While it is possible that this lack of correlation could be explained by our use of the ATPase activity of the <i>S. pombe</i> wild type and mutant cohesins as an approximation of the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> cohesin, this explanaition seems unlikely. The aspartate of the D-loop is absolutely conserved in all SMC complexes and highly conserved among very diverse ABC ATPase modules. Our analysis of analogous substitutions in the homodimeric Rad50 protein shows similar reductions in the ATPase activity. Finally, many published biochemical and structural studies have used cohesin complexes from different organisms as a proxy for <i>S. cerevisiae</i> cohesin to provide physiologically relevant insights. Intriguingly, the uncoupling of ATPase activity and function by D-loop mutations has been observed for several other ABC ATPases (<a href=\"#bib8\">Furman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Grossmann et al., 2014</a>)."

The <i>smc1-D1164E</i> mutation may mimic the ADP-Pi state, whereas the <i>smc1-D1164A</i> mutant could be blocked elsewhere in the ATPase cycle (ATP bound or nucleotide free). Both the <i>smc1-D1164E</i> and <i>smc1-D1164A</i> would dramatically reduce overall ATPase activity but only the <i>smc1-D1164E</i> would promote cohesin function. A similar case of trapping the ADP+Pi state is hypothesized for the MRP1 ABC transporter, for a glutamate substitution of an aspartate residue (<a href=\"#bib32\">Qin and Cao, 2008</a>). Elucidating the exact relationship between the particular nucleotide states of the Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase active sites and cohesin functions will likely require in vitro reconstitution of cohesin\u2019s various functions and detailed structural studies."

In the absence of acetylation, continued cycles of ATP hydrolysis prevent cohesin from maintaining the conformation necessary for tethering\u00a0(Figure\u00a07D).

This could be due to (1) the inherent inefficiency of acetylation both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in only a small subset of cohesin being acetylated, (2) the inability of glutamine substitutions of K112 and K113 in Smc3 to mimic the acetylated state, (3) the failure to assay cohesin ATPase activity on DNA. Alternatively, Eco1-mediated acetylation may stabilize\u00a0an\u00a0intermediate state of cohesin in a way that makes subsequent cycles of ATP hydrolysis unable to alter the tethering conformation. Either way, the result is that acetylation traps cohesin in its tethering form to stabilize cohesion during or soon after establishment. Testing whether Eco1-mediated acetylation directly downregulates the cohesin ATPase cycle when bound to DNA and how the ATPase cycle affects cohesin conformation will require better reconstitution of cohesin function in vitro."

Unbound/unstably bound cohesin was washed off using the following washes: 1x500 \u03bcL CL1, 3\u00a0x\u00a0500 \u03bcL in CL1 with 500 mM KCl, then 1x500 \u03bcL CL1. CD-B were then resuspended in 50 \u03bcL ATPase buffer 2. This sample of CD-B contained about% 20 of the initial input cohesin, which was approximately the same amount of cohesin as the other samples in this experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), as could be judged by the protein gel. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 \u03bcL 5xATP hot mix to 40 \u03bcL protein/DNA mix for 2 hours at 30\u00b0C and samples were processed as described above. The ATPase activity of T4 Rad50 and mutants was measured in ATPase buffer 1 for 2 hours at 30\u00b0C as described above, except 1 \u03bcM Rad50 was used. Error bars represent standard error of data from at least two independent experiments."

In the Smc1 ATPase active site the Walker A and Walker B motifs are encoded by Smc1, while the D-loop and signature motifs are encoded by Smc3. Likewise, the Smc3 ATPase active site contains the Smc3-encoded Walker A and Walker B motifs, and Smc1-encoded D-loop and signature motifs (Arumugam et al., 2006; Haering et al., 2004; Hopfner et al., 2000).\u201d"

Given the proposed role of the D-loops in mediating communication between the two active sites, it is certainly possible that they would have an effect on the ATPase activity of both subunits. Indeed, as shown before, the walker A mutations in either subunit appears to effect activity of both subunits, bringing down the total activity to near background levels, further arguing that it is very difficult to affect one ATPase without affecting the other in ABC ATPases. As mentioned by the reviewers, our main point is that the two ATPase active sites are not functionally equivalent, suggesting that they modulate different steps in cohesin function. To clarify this point, we have now altered our model in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, and expanded our Discussion (please see below) to mention that we refer to the regulation of the cohesin ATPase by these active sites, and that we are not measuring the individual activities of each active site."

The D-loop may impact the nucleotide state only in the Smc3 ATPase active site. Alternatively, it could alter the nucleotide state of both active sites. Support for the latter comes from studies on the ABC ATPase domains in ABC transporters, which suggest that ATP hydrolysis by the two sites is cooperative (Holland and Blight, 1999), and that D-loops are involved in mediating the communication between the two active sites within the ATPase (Furman et al., 2013; Hohl et al., 2012; 2014).\u201d"

First, we now acknowledge that using ATPase activity of the <i>S. pombe</i> wild-type and mutant cohesins is an approximation of the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> cohesin and some of the discordance could possibly be explained by this approximation. We present our arguments for why the use of the <i>S. pombe</i> cohesin as a proxy and the observed discordance is likely physiologically relevant. Finally, we improve the presentation of our model that the intermediates in the ATPase cycle are critical for regulating cohesin function, not the level of ATPase activity. A mutant protein that blocks the exchange of ADP-Pi with ATP will dramatically reduce the level of ATPase activity, but it would not impair cohesin function if the ADP-Pi state is the active form. In contrast, a mutant that radically reduces ATP hydrolysis will also reduce ATPase activity but trap cohesin in the ATP-bound state, which could impair cohesin function if this state is inactive. We hope that these revisions will make the discordance enlightening and no longer confusing. We have incorporated these points into the Discussion under the subheading \u201cCohesin functions can be separated from overall ATPase activity levels\u201d."
