The hominoid-specific gene <i>TBC1D3</i> undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution, but it's role in brain development has not been explored. Here, we found that expression of <i>TBC1D3</i> in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via <i>in utero</i> electroporation caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells (vRGs) and promotes generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with typical morphology of outer radial glia (oRG), which are most abundant in primates. Furthermore, down-regulation of <i>TBC1D3</i> in cultured human brain slices decreased generation of oRGs. Interestingly, localized oRG proliferation resulting from either <i>in utero</i> electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3, was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. Thus, we have identified a hominoid gene that is required for oRG generation in regulating the cortical expansion and folding."
