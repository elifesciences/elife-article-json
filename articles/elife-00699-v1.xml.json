Here, we synthesized a new stimulus to examine the detection of coherent patterns (\u2018figures\u2019) from overlapping \u2018background\u2019 signals. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that human listeners are remarkably sensitive to the emergence of such figures and can tolerate a variety of spectral and temporal perturbations. This robust behavior is consistent with the existence of automatic auditory segregation mechanisms that are highly sensitive to correlations across frequency and time. The observed behavior cannot be explained purely on the basis of adaptation-based models used to explain the segregation of deterministic narrowband signals. We show that the present results are consistent with the predictions of a model of auditory perceptual organization based on temporal coherence. Our data thus support a role for temporal coherence as an organizational principle underlying auditory segregation."

Here, we synthesized a new stimulus to examine the detection of coherent patterns (\u2018figures\u2019) from overlapping \u2018background\u2019 signals. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that human listeners are remarkably sensitive to the emergence of such figures and can tolerate a variety of spectral and temporal perturbations. This robust behavior is consistent with the existence of automatic auditory segregation mechanisms that are highly sensitive to correlations across frequency and time. The observed behavior cannot be explained purely on the basis of adaptation-based models used to explain the segregation of deterministic narrowband signals. We show that the present results are consistent with the predictions of a model of auditory perceptual organization based on temporal coherence. Our data thus support a role for temporal coherence as an organizational principle underlying auditory segregation."

Much work using these streaming signals has been carried out to elucidate the neural substrates and computations that underlie auditory segregation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Moore and Gockel, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Snyder et al., 2012</a>). In a series of seminal experiments, Fishman and colleagues recorded multi-unit activity from the auditory cortex of macaques in response to a simple streaming sequence (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fishman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">2004</a>). For large frequency differences and fast presentation rates, which promote two distinct perceptual streams, they observed spatially segregated responses to the two tones. This pattern of segregated cortical activation, proposed to underlie the streaming percept, has since been widely replicated (e.g., <a href=\"#bib4\">Bee and Klump, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Micheyl et al., 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bidet-Caulet and Bertrand, 2009</a>) and attributed to basic physiological principles of frequency selectivity, forward masking and neural adaptation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fishman and Steinschneider, 2010a</a>). These properties are considered to contribute to stream segregation by promoting the activation of distinct neuronal populations in the primary auditory cortex (A1) that are well separated along the tonotopic axis (<a href=\"#bib40\">McCabe and Denham, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Carlyon, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Micheyl et al., 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Moore and Gockel, 2012</a>). Human imaging studies that directly correlated the perceptual representation of streaming sequences with brain responses also support the correspondence between the streaming percept and the underlying neural activity in A1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gutschalk et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Snyder et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wilson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cusack, 2005</a>). However, similar effects have also been demonstrated in the auditory nerve, suggesting that processes contributing to segregation might occur earlier in the ascending auditory pathway rather than be mediated exclusively by the auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beauvois and Meddis, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Pressnitzer et al., 2008</a>)."

Moving beyond streaming, Kidd and colleagues developed a spectrally rich signal referred to as the \u2018informational masking\u2019 (IM) stimulus (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kidd et al., 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kidd and Mason, 2003</a>). IM refers to a type of non-energetic or central masking that is associated with an increase in detection thresholds due to stimulus uncertainty and target-masker similarity that is distinct from peripheral energetic masking (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pollack, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Durlach et al., 2003</a>). These multi-tone masking experiments required listeners to detect tonal target signals in the presence of simultaneous multi-tone maskers, often separated by a \u2018spectral protection region\u2019 (a certain frequency region around the target with little masker energy) that promoted the perceptual segregation of the target from the masker tones. Results demonstrate that target detection is critically dependent on the width of the spectral protection region, and the \u2018density\u2019 of the maskers (<a href=\"#bib44\">Micheyl et al., 2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Gutschalk et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Elhilali et al., 2009b</a>), and has been hypothesized to rely on the same adaptation-based mechanisms as proposed in the context of simple streaming signals (<a href=\"#bib44\">Micheyl et al., 2007b</a>)."

Indeed, the ability of models inspired by such paradigms to explain segregation is currently under debate. Recently, Elhilali et al. (2009a) demonstrated that when the two tones in a streaming signal are presented synchronously, listeners perceive the sequence as one stream irrespective of the frequency separation between the two tones, a result that is inconsistent with predictions based on adaptation-based models. Instead, the authors argued that in addition to separation in feature space, temporal coherence between different elements in the scene is essential for segregation such that temporally incoherent patterns tend to result in a segregated percept while temporal coherence promotes integration (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shamma et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Fishman and Steinschneider, 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Micheyl et al., 2013a</a>,<a href=\"#bib45\">b</a>)."

It is notable that the patterns were very brief (longest figure duration was 7 chords or 350 ms), yet very high levels of performance were observed (and without extensive practice).

Since \u2018figure-absent\u2019 and \u2018figure-present\u2019 signals were controlled for overall number of components (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), a global power increase per se associated with the emergence of the figure, can be discounted as a potential cue. However, it is possible that the decisions of the listeners are based on other changes within the stimulus, for example, the emergence of a figure might be associated with a change in the temporal modulation rate of a few frequency channels. The purpose of experiment 2 was to investigate whether the detection of figures involves a specific figure-ground decomposition, namely whether the figure components are grouped together as a detectable \u2018perceptual object\u2019 distinct from the background components, or whether listeners were rather just detecting some low-level changes within the ongoing stimulus. To address this issue, we created stimulus triplets with different background patterns in which each stimulus contained a figure but where figure components were identical in two out of the three signals. Listeners were required to identify the \u2018odd\u2019 signal that contained a different figure from the other two signals with identical figures in this AXB psychophysical paradigm (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). Results (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) indicate that for the very short figure duration (4 chords, or 200 ms) listeners had difficulty with this discrimination task (d\u2032 = 0.31 \u00b1 0.18; not significantly different from 0: p=0.12, t = 1.72), but that performance increased significantly for a figure duration of 8 chords (400 ms; d\u2032 = 1.75 \u00b1 0.34) and reached ceiling for a figure duration of 12 chords (600 ms; d\u2032 = 2.93 \u00b1 0.26). This pattern of results indicates that figure detection in these stimuli is associated with a segregation mechanism whereby coherent components are grouped together as a distinct perceptual object."

The figure and background in the SFG stimuli overlap in frequency space, thus challenging segregation based on activation of spatially distinct neuronal populations in A1. Furthermore, the data clearly indicate that performance strongly depends on the number of simultaneously repeating frequency components, suggesting a mechanism that is able to integrate across widely spaced frequency channels, an element missing in previous models based on streaming. Instead, the psychophysical data are consistent with a recently proposed model of auditory object formation based on analysis of temporal coherence (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shamma et al., 2011</a>)."

In our stimuli, the \u2018figure\u2019 (defined by the correlated tones) perceptually stands out against a background of random uncorrelated tones. The temporal coherence model postulates that the figure becomes progressively more salient with more correlated tones in the different frequency channels. To measure this coherence, we computed a correlation matrix across all channels of the spectrogram. In principle, the correlation between the activations of any two channels at time <i>t</i> should be computed over a certain time window in the past, of a duration that is commensurate with the rates of tone presentations in the channels; this may range roughly between 2 Hz and 40 Hz depending on the experimental session.

This suggests that the segregation mechanisms in question are more susceptible to spectral than temporal perturbations (as in experiments 3, and 6 below) but can still integrate over dynamically changing, rather than fixed, figure components. Finally, as with previous experiments, there were significant correlations among the channels predicting the saliency of the figure. However, the optimal rate at which the correlations occurred here was slightly lower (at 10 Hz; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>) than that of experiment 1 (20 Hz), perhaps because two 50 ms chords are integrated as a single unit to define the ramp."

The mechanism scales in time, in that detection depends on the number of components over time rather than their absolute duration (experiment 3) and can still operate if the object is defined by slowly changing frequency trajectories rather than a fixed set of frequencies (experiment 4). It is robust to interruption of the figure by interleaved noise (experiment 5) and can operate over a remarkably long timescale (experiment 6).

Each chord contains a random number (average: 10 and varying between 5 and 15) of pure tone components. The spectral components are randomly selected from a set of 129 frequencies equally spaced on a logarithmic scale between 179 Hz and 7246 Hz such that the separation between successive components is 1/24<sup>th</sup> of an octave. The onset and offset of each chord are shaped by a 10 ms raised-cosine ramp. In half of these stimuli, a random number of tones are repeated across a certain number of consecutive chords (e.g., in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, four components marked by arrows are repeated across 6 chords) which results in the percept of a \u2018figure\u2019 that readily pops out of the random tonal background. To eliminate correlation between the number of figure and background components, the figure was realized by first generating the random background and then adding additional, repeating components to the relevant chords. To avoid the problem that the interval containing the figure might, on average, also contain more frequency components, and to prevent listeners from relying on this feature in performing the figure detection task, the remaining 50% of the stimuli (those containing no figure) also included additional tonal components, which were added over a variable number (2\u20137) of consecutive chords at the same time as when a figure would have appeared. But these additional components changed from chord to chord and did not form a coherent figure."

This was based on the prediction that the background chords before and after the figure onset contribute little to the cross-correlation matrix unlike the chords comprising the figure. The simulations were performed separately for the stimuli containing a figure and without a figure and repeated across 500 iterations. To establish differences between the resultant coherence matrices, we computed the maximum value of the cross-correlation across all time points. This spectral decomposition helps us to examine which channels are correlated with each other (hence, the channels with repeating figure components could possibly be bound together as one object, or the \u2018figure\u2019), and not significantly correlated with each other (hence, the channels with random correlation between channels may not be perceived as a single object). The difference in the average values of the maxima between the figure and the ground stimuli was calculated as the model response and plotted like the psychophysical curves to obtain model responses (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

In contrast to other studies of this kind, there are no protective spectral regions where the background tones are omitted. The authors demonstrate that after initial training, most subjects are able to segregate the foreground sound pattern (one sound source) from the background sound source. Studies were appropriately performed with adequate controls. Indeed, it is remarkable that segregation of the foreground tone sequence still occurs despite introduction of interleaved bursts of white noise between the foreground tones. The duration of the white noise could extend up to 500 ms. These findings are clearly beyond the segregation capacities of core auditory cortex and the authors rightfully suggest non-classical auditory cortical processing stations as being the most likely generators of this percept. Further, the authors concisely provide modeling data and evidence that the temporal coherence model is the most appropriate model for explaining how this foreground/background segregation develops."
