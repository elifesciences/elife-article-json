Whereas maternal control over this remodeling is well described, paternal contributions are virtually unknown. In this study, we show that <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> males lacking <i>Heterochromatin Protein 1E</i> (<i>HP1E</i>) sire inviable embryos that undergo catastrophic mitosis. In these embryos, the paternal genome fails to condense and resolve into sister chromatids in synchrony with the maternal genome. This delay leads to a failure of paternal chromosomes, particularly the heterochromatin-rich sex chromosomes, to separate on the first mitotic spindle. Remarkably, HP1E is not inherited on mature sperm chromatin. Instead, HP1E primes paternal chromosomes during spermatogenesis to ensure faithful segregation post-fertilization. This transgenerational effect suggests that maternal control is necessary but not sufficient for transforming sperm DNA into a mitotically competent pronucleus. Instead, paternal action during spermiogenesis exerts post-fertilization control to ensure faithful chromosome segregation in the embryo."

Whereas maternal control over this remodeling is well described, paternal contributions are virtually unknown. In this study, we show that <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> males lacking <i>Heterochromatin Protein 1E</i> (<i>HP1E</i>) sire inviable embryos that undergo catastrophic mitosis. In these embryos, the paternal genome fails to condense and resolve into sister chromatids in synchrony with the maternal genome. This delay leads to a failure of paternal chromosomes, particularly the heterochromatin-rich sex chromosomes, to separate on the first mitotic spindle. Remarkably, HP1E is not inherited on mature sperm chromatin. Instead, HP1E primes paternal chromosomes during spermatogenesis to ensure faithful segregation post-fertilization. This transgenerational effect suggests that maternal control is necessary but not sufficient for transforming sperm DNA into a mitotically competent pronucleus. Instead, paternal action during spermiogenesis exerts post-fertilization control to ensure faithful chromosome segregation in the embryo."

The very first embryonic mitosis in animals requires additional synchronization. Paternally and maternally inherited genomes undergo independent chromatin reorganization and replication prior to mitotic entry. For instance, maternal chromosomes must complete meiosis (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sen et al., 2013</a>) and then transition from a meiotic conformation to an interphase-like state in preparation for replication. The sperm-deposited, paternal chromosomes must undergo an even more radical transition from a highly compact, protamine-rich state to a decondensed, histone-rich state before DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib5\">Braun, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Miller et al., 2010</a>). Despite these divergent requirements to achieve replication- and mitotic-competency, maternal and paternal genomes synchronously enter the first mitosis. Failure to carry out paternal chromosome remodeling in a timely fashion results in paternal genome loss and embryonic inviability (<a href=\"#bib45\">Loppin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">McLay and Clarke, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Landmann et al., 2009</a>)."

If so, disruption of such control would manifest as paternal effect lethality (PEL). Unlike male sterility mutants that lack motile sperm, PEL mutants make abundant motile sperm that fertilize eggs efficiently. However, embryos \u2018fathered\u2019 by PEL mutants are inviable. Only a handful of PEL genes have been characterized in animals (<a href=\"#bib6\">Browning and Strome, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fitch and Wakimoto, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fitch et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Loppin et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Smith and Wakimoto, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Seidel et al., 2011</a>). These encode proteins that mediate sperm release of paternal DNA, sperm centriole inheritance, and paternal chromosome segregation. Only one of these PEL proteins directly localizes to paternal chromosomes; the sperm-inherited K81 protein localizes exclusively to paternal chromosome termini and ensures telomere integrity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dubruille et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gao et al., 2011</a>). The maintenance of telomeric epigenetic identity joins a growing list of examples of sperm-to-embryo information transmission via protein or RNA inheritance (e.g., diet: [<a href=\"#bib52\">Ost et al., 2014</a>], stress: [<a href=\"#bib58\">Rodgers et al., 2013</a>], embryonic patterning: [<a href=\"#bib4\">Bayer et al., 2009</a>], transcriptional competency: [<a href=\"#bib27\">Hammoud et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rando, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ihara et al., 2014</a>]). Despite our new appreciation of paternal control over epigenetic information transfer, there are no reports of paternal control over the global chromatin reorganization required for synchronous mitosis across paternally and maternally inherited genomes. Indeed, in the absence of any known paternal protein-directed genome remodeling, a model has emerged that maternal proteins might be sufficient for transforming tightly packaged sperm DNA into a fully competent paternal pronucleus."

Although the identity of the host factor(s) manipulated by <i>Wolbachia</i> to mediate this transgenerational effect is still unknown, what is clear is that pre-fertilization, <i>Wolbachia</i> subverts the paternal germline machinery that helps direct global genome remodeling of paternal chromosomes in the embryo. <i>Wolbachia</i> action during spermiogenesis leads to paternal-maternal genome asynchrony and ultimately, failure of paternal chromosomes to separate on the first mitotic spindle (<a href=\"#bib7\">Callaini et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Landmann et al., 2009</a>).

Using detailed genetic and cytological analyses, here we show that one of these testis-specific HP1 proteins, <i>Heterochromatin Protein 1E</i> (HP1E), is essential for priming the paternal genome to enter embryonic mitosis in synchrony with the maternal genome in <i>D. melanogaster</i>. Intriguingly, HP1E is able to mediate this priming function transgenerationally i.e., the HP1E protein itself is not epigenetically inherited. We further show that absence of HP1E especially imperils mitotic fidelity of the heterochromatin-rich, paternal sex chromosomes. Thus, our study firmly establishes that both maternal and paternal control are necessary for paternal genome remodeling in the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo."

In addition, we raised a highly specific polyclonal antibody against HP1E (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

HP1E signal was generally diffuse across a subset of the chromatin throughout spermiogenesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>) but disappeared completely at sperm maturation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Native expression of the <i>HP1E-YFP</i> fusion transgene confirmed our immunofluorescence results (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), implying that HP1E disappearance in late spermiogenesis is not due to antibody inaccessibility in the highly condensed sperm head.

                                "text": "Many characterized HP1 proteins serve critical heterochromatin organization roles and are often used as markers of canonical heterochromatin in somatic cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eissenberg and Elgin, 2000</a>). However, heterochromatin organization is poorly defined in post-meiotic developing spermatids (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dubruille et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hennig and Weyrich, 2013</a>), precluding our ability to ask if HP1E co-localizes with classic bulk heterochromatin markers. We were also unable to directly ascertain HP1E localization to specific heterochromatin loci using chromatin immunoprecipitation based methods (e.g., ChIP-seq). Instead, we adopted an orthogonal approach. We conducted RNA-seq on control and HP1E-depleted testes, reasoning that loss of heterochromatin organizing protein would uniquely perturb the global transcriptional readout from this specialized genome compartment. We found that <i>HP1E</i> knockdown during this narrow developmental stage affects the expression of over 700 genes (fdr &lt; 0.05, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Of those 700 genes significantly misregulated upon knockdown, there were very few genes that encode known chromatin-modifying or chromosome-bound proteins; of these, most represent uncharacterized genes. However, one intriguing pattern that does emerge from this dataset is that 100% of significantly misregulated heterochromatin-embedded genes are upregulated when <i>HP1E</i> is depleted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In comparison, less than 60% of significantly misregulated euchromatin-embedded genes are upregulated. This dichotomy between the effects of <i>HP1E</i> depletion on the euchromatic and heterochromatic compartment is highly significant (p &lt; 0.00001) and suggests a direct action of HP1E in the heterochromatic compartment, akin to its closest HP1 relative, HP1A (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kellum et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Levine et al., 2012</a>). Alternatively, one or more of the 700 mis-regulated genes could be responsible for modifying paternal chromatin. However, no obvious candidate genes involved in chromatin modification or binding emerged from the list of mis-regulated genes (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). In the absence of direct evidence of heterochromatin localization via cytology or ChIP-seq, we can only tentatively conclude that HP1E acts directly on this genome compartment. In contrast, HP1E unambiguously localizes to chromatin during sperm development."

AcH4 accumulates preferentially on paternal chromatin prior to and during embryonic mitotic cycle 1, allowing us to distinguish paternal from maternal DNA (<a href=\"#bib3\">Adenot et al., 1997</a>). PEL embryos revealed no gross defects in maternal chromatin dynamics (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and exhibited stereotypical centrosome and spindle morphology (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, sperm DNA in PEL embryos underwent the protamine-to-histone transition (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), decondensed, migrated toward the maternal pronucleus, and entered into the first mitosis just like in wild-type embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Using antibodies against a replication protein (PCNA) and a kinetochore protein (Cenp-C), we also found that both pronuclei recruit replication machinery and initiate kinetochore assembly in PEL embryos (<a href=\"#fig5s3 fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 3, 4</a>)."

Nevertheless, we wanted to formally consider the possibility that low levels of sperm-inherited HP1E might act during early embryogenesis to ensure proper mitosis. If this was the case (as with <i>spe-11</i> [<a href=\"#bib6\">Browning and Strome, 1996</a>]), the defects we observed arising in PEL embryos could be due to missing HP1E protein in the embryo itself. To test this possibility, we used ectopic over-expression of <i>HP1E</i> during oogenesis to maternally deposit HP1E protein into the embryo. This over-expression strategy resulted in robustly detectable HP1E levels in the embryo (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), whereas embryos laid by control females harbor no detectable HP1E. However, maternally deposited HP1E was unable to rescue the PEL defect associated with sperm from HP1E-depleted males (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Consistent with the testis cytology presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, these data suggest that it is HP1E action during spermiogenesis, rather than in early embryogenesis, which is responsible for ensuring proper embryonic mitosis. Combined with the successful rescue of mitotic cycling by <i>sesame-</i> mothers, we conclude that HP1E primes the paternal genome during spermiogenesis i.e., pre-fertilization, to ensure proper remodeling of the paternal genome in embryos post-fertilization<i>.</i>"

These data suggest that the DNA present in the telophase bridge is more likely to be proximal to the X-rDNA cluster (although not the rDNA itself) than the 359 bp satellite repeats. It is currently unclear whether any of our targeted sequences are responsible for PEL. Nevertheless, our discovery of different frequencies for different probes on the X- and Y-chromosomes implicates discrete loci rather than entire chromosomes underlying mitotic failure, as was discovered for <i>D. melanogaster-Drosophila simulans</i> hybrid embryos at nuclear cycles 10\u201313 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ferree and Barbash, 2009</a>). However, unlike the hybrid case where the 359 bp probe signal appears stretched across the chromatin bridge at these later stage embryos, we observed mostly condensed foci in the bridge of the very first mitosis."

No such cell cycle checkpoint proteins have been identified to act in the very first embryonic mitotic cycle (<a href=\"#bib50\">O'Farrell et al., 2004</a>), which must nevertheless accomplish the difficult task of synchronizing maternal and paternal chromosomes that were inherited in very different chromatin states. To investigate the paternal contributions that ensure timely participation of the paternal genome in early embryogenesis, we carried out a detailed functional analysis of the testis-restricted <i>HP1E</i> gene in <i>D. melanogaster</i>. We found that <i>HP1E</i> encodes a novel function that ensures paternal genome stability in the embryo. Our cytological and transcriptome analysis revealed that <i>HP1E</i> is developmentally restricted within the male germline, where it contributes to heterochromatin integrity. HP1E depletion during sperm development results in a highly penetrant PEL phenotype in which paternal chromosomes, especially the paternal sex chromosomes, fail to condense in synchrony with the maternal chromosomes and ultimately cause mitotic catastrophe. We further showed that the PEL embryonic phenotype could not be rescued by egg-supplied HP1E but could be rescued if the paternal DNA was excluded from participating in embryonic mitosis. These observations support a model (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>) under which HP1E acts pre-fertilization to ensure proper chromosome condensation and segregation of paternal chromosomes post-fertilization."

These include the <i>D. melanogaster</i> paternal chromatin-associated PEL, <i>k81</i>, which encodes a protein that persists on paternal telomeres from late spermatogenesis to the first embryonic mitosis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dubruille et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gao et al., 2011</a>). The HP1E-depletion phenotype is instead reminiscent of <i>Drosophila</i> fathers infected with <i>Wolbachia</i> bacteria crossed to uninfected females (<a href=\"#bib66\">Serbus et al., 2008</a>). Embryonic lethality induced by <i>Wolbachia</i> testis infection is also caused by a pre-fertilization modification to the paternal genome that results in paternal-maternal chromatin asynchrony and mis-segregation at the very first zygotic mitosis. However, <i>Wolbachia</i>-associated PEL results in mis-segregation of the entire paternal genome (<a href=\"#bib36\">Landmann et al., 2009</a>) rather than just the heterochromatin-rich chromosomes observed in HP1E\u2014PEL (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Moreover, the <i>HP1E</i> PEL defect is completely independent of <i>Wolbachia</i> (we find that PEL phenotype persists for Wolbachia-free males and females). We therefore conclude that <i>HP1E</i> supports a novel chromatin requirement to prime paternally inherited genomes for synchronous and successful embryonic mitosis."

It is formally possible that the PEL phenotype is the consequence of a dysregulated spermatid transcriptome that is, up- or down-regulation of a downstream gene. However, our finding that HP1E depletion results in the global up-regulation of heterochromatin-embedded genes, together with our observation that the heterochromatin-rich paternal sex chromosomes are most vulnerable to HP1E depletion, lead us to favor the alternate model that HP1E functions as a canonical HP1 protein during spermiogenesis. Based on antibody localization (<a href=\"#fig5s3 fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 3, 4</a>) and chromatin bridge morphology (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), we found no evidence for defects in kinetochore assembly or replication machinery engagement in PEL embryos. Instead, our observation that the lethality phenotype first manifests as decondensed paternal chromosomes relative to maternal chromosomes implicates condensation delay of the heterochromatin-rich sex chromosomes. This delay could be the consequence of incomplete replication (<a href=\"#bib36\">Landmann et al., 2009</a>). Indeed, large stretches of uninterrupted heterochromatic DNA, as found on the <i>Drosophila</i> sex chromosomes, pose a unique challenge to replication (<a href=\"#bib40\">Leach et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pryor et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Collins et al., 2002</a>). Alternatively, the mitotic delay may be the result of inadequate condensin protein recruitment, which is required for timely resolution of sister chromatids post-replication (<a href=\"#bib69\">Steffensen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dej et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Savvidou et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cobbe et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hirano, 2012</a>). Previous studies have shown that heterochromatin can also impair chromosome condensation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Peng and Karpen, 2007</a>). Timely completion of replication and condensation requires the action of HP1E's closest relative, HP1A, in somatic cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kellum et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Schwaiger et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2011</a>). However, in developing spermatids, HP1A localizes to telomeres (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dubruille et al., 2010</a>) rather than broadly to heterochromatin as observed in virtually all other cell types. We posit that HP1E adopts a global, HP1A-like chromatin function during this highly specialized developmental stage and ensures the recruitment or retention of either replication or condensin proteins that are required post-fertilization."

We show here that paternally-acting HP1E is also essential for embryogenesis. Both <i>HP1A</i> and <i>HP1E</i> evolve under purifying selection (<a href=\"#bib41\">Levine et al., 2012</a>). However, unlike HP1A (encoded by <i>Su(var)205</i>), <i>HP1E</i> has an unusually dynamic evolutionary history. Despite ancient origins, <i>HP1E</i> has been recurrently lost over evolutionary time. <i>HP1E</i> has been apparently replaced by younger, testis restricted HP1 paralogs on at least two occasions during <i>Drosophila</i> evolution (<a href=\"#bib41\">Levine et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)<i>.</i> Curiously, <i>Drosophila pseudoobscura</i> and related species encode neither <i>HP1E</i> nor a putative replacement testis-specific HP1 gene. How do we reconcile the paradox of <i>HP1E</i> essentiality in <i>D. melanogaster</i> with its loss in <i>D. pseudoobscura</i>? We previously found that HP1E loss along in <i>D. pseudoobscura</i>-related species occurred during the same 7-million evolutionary period as a major sex chromosome rearrangement event (<a href=\"#bib41\">Levine et al., 2012</a>), in which the ancestral Y was lost, a neo-Y chromosome was born, and the ancestral X fused to an autosome (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carvalho and Clark, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Larracuente et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Our finding that the <i>D. melanogaster</i> sex chromosomes are especially vulnerable to HP1E depletion, combined with the emergence of novel sex chromosome arrangements along the same narrow branch as <i>HP1E</i> pseudogenization (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), suggests a model under which rearrangements of heterochromatin-rich sex chromosomes in the <i>obscura</i> group rendered <i>HP1E</i> non-essential. Such karyotypic changes can bring distal heterochromatin into closer proximity to euchromatin and be sufficient to alter heterochromatin packaging (<a href=\"#bib68\">Spofford, 1976</a>), replication timing (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abramov et al., 2005</a>) or even delete blocks of satellite repeats (<a href=\"#bib26\">Garagna et al., 1995</a>). Thus, heterochromatin evolution via chromosomal rearrangements may have obviated maintenance of <i>HP1E</i>'s essential heterochromatin function, leading to its degeneration in <i>D. pseudoobscura</i>."

In contrast, maternally deposited proteins required for paternal chromatin reorganization following fertilization are generally conserved from fly to human (e.g., <a href=\"#bib46\">Loppin et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Konev et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Delabaere et al., 2014</a>).

To facilitate sperm imaging, we crossed flies encoding the (<i>donjuan</i>) <i>dj-GFP</i> construct (<a href=\"#bib61\">Santel et al., 1997</a>) into an <i>HP1E</i> knockdown background and mounted the male seminal vesicle, the female seminal receptacle to which these males were crossed, and the 5 min-old embryos oviposited by these females. We used a similar scheme to visualize protamine:GFP (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jayaramaiah Raja and Renkawitz-Pohl, 2005</a>) in embryos fathered by <i>HP1E</i>-knockdown males."

We designed these constructs using Gateway technology (<a href=\"http://emb.carnegiescience.edu/labs/murphy/Gateway%20vectors.html\">emb.carnegiescience.edu/labs/murphy/Gateway%20vectors.html</a>) following standard procedures (destination vectors pHFW and pHVW, respectively).

We transiently induced expression by heat shock (following <a href=\"#bib59\">Ross et al., 2013</a>). We washed the recovered cells in PBS and re-suspended in RIPA buffer, sonicated, pelleted, and re-suspended in SDS loading buffer.

Western blotting and IF data indicate that HP1E protein localizes to nuclei during spermatogenesis, but is not incorporated into mature sperm or transferred to the embryo. The authors also show that maternal expression of HP1E does not rescue the PEL phenotype, and use a very elegant genetic experiment to show that the embryonic mitotic defects are specifically due to failure to segregate the paternal chromosomes. Based on these observations, the authors propose that HP1E establishes an epigenetic mark that is essential to reorganization of the male pronucleus. The data are consistent with this model, but HP1E mutations alter expression of over 700 genes, and it is also possible that one or more of these genes establish an inherited modification or encode a chromatin protein that is required for reorganization and segregation of the male pronucleus. While directly testing this hypothesis is difficult, this possibility needs to be considered /discussed. Nonetheless, the experiments are well executed, clearly presented, and genetically define a novel paternal function in pronuclear reorganization. The additional experiments suggested below are not essential, but would strengthen the story and could provide mechanistic insights:"

If not, the authors appear to have the reagents needed to perform the experiment, and it could provide important insight into HP1E function."

Here with HP1E mutant the probes are forming clusters that don't look any more stretched out compared to normal segregation, e.g., when comparing the presumed maternal and paternal X's in the female embryo. So most of the stretched material in the bridge is unidentified. It would be informative to look at additional probes such as rDNA and a few euchromatic loci. Were centromeres looked at (may have missed)?</i> <a href=\"#fig7\"><i>Figure 7</i></a> <i>(and others) are also lacking wild type controls.
