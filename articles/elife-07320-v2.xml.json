                    "text": "Prp3 is an essential U4/U6 di-snRNP-associated protein whose functions and molecular mechanisms in pre-mRNA splicing are presently poorly understood. We show by structural and biochemical analyses that Prp3 contains a bipartite U4/U6 di-snRNA-binding region comprising an expanded ferredoxin-like fold, which recognizes a 3\u2032-overhang of U6 snRNA, and a preceding peptide, which binds U4/U6 stem II. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the single-stranded RNA-binding domain is exclusively found in Prp3 orthologs, thus qualifying as a spliceosome-specific RNA interaction module. The composite double-stranded/single-stranded RNA-binding region assembles cooperatively with Snu13 and Prp31 on U4/U6 di-snRNAs and inhibits Brr2-mediated U4/U6 di-snRNA unwinding in vitro. RNP-disrupting mutations in Prp3 lead to U4/U6\u2022U5 tri-snRNP assembly and splicing defects in vivo. Our results reveal how Prp3 acts as an important bridge between U4/U6 and U5 in the tri-snRNP and comparison with a Prp24-U6 snRNA recycling complex suggests how Prp3 may be involved in U4/U6 reassembly after splicing."

We show by structural and biochemical analyses that Prp3 contains a bipartite U4/U6 di-snRNA-binding region comprising an expanded ferredoxin-like fold, which recognizes a 3\u2032-overhang of U6 snRNA, and a preceding peptide, which binds U4/U6 stem II. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the single-stranded RNA-binding domain is exclusively found in Prp3 orthologs, thus qualifying as a spliceosome-specific RNA interaction module. The composite double-stranded/single-stranded RNA-binding region assembles cooperatively with Snu13 and Prp31 on U4/U6 di-snRNAs and inhibits Brr2-mediated U4/U6 di-snRNA unwinding in vitro. RNP-disrupting mutations in Prp3 lead to U4/U6\u2022U5 tri-snRNP assembly and splicing defects in vivo. Our results reveal how Prp3 acts as an important bridge between U4/U6 and U5 in the tri-snRNP and comparison with a Prp24-U6 snRNA recycling complex suggests how Prp3 may be involved in U4/U6 reassembly after splicing."

These subunits must assemble around an unedited mRNA in a particular order so that the spliceosome can work correctly. Once the mRNA has been edited, and the spliceosome has performed its job, these complexes need to disassemble so that they are ready to be reassembled around a new mRNA molecule. A protein called Prp3 is known to be involved in these assembly, disassembly and reassembly steps. However, it is unclear how this protein performs these activities."

For each splicing event, a spliceosome is newly formed via the stepwise recruitment of small nuclear (sn) RNPs (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 in the case of the major spliceosome) and numerous non-snRNP proteins to a pre-mRNA substrate (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wahl et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2011</a>). During canonical cross-intron spliceosome assembly, U1 and U2 snRNPs bind the 5\u2032-splice site (5\u2032SS) and the branch point region of an intron, respectively (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mount et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kramer et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Parker et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wu and Manley, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zhuang and Weiner, 1989</a>). Formation of this A complex is followed by the recruitment of a preformed U4/U6\u2022U5 tri-snRNP, yielding the pre-catalytic B complex (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bindereif and Green, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cheng and Abelson, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Konarska and Sharp, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Deckert et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fabrizio et al., 2009</a>), which requires extensive conformational and compositional rearrangements to form a catalytically active spliceosome. Catalytic activation includes the disruption of the U1/5\u2032SS interaction (<a href=\"#bib30\">Konforti et al., 1993</a>) and the separation of U4 snRNA from U6 snRNA (<a href=\"#bib28\">Konarska and Sharp, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yean and Lin, 1991</a>), which are extensively base-paired in the tri-snRNP and in the B complex, leading to the dissociation of U1 snRNP, U4 snRNA and all U4/U6-associated proteins. These rearrangements give rise to the B<sup>act</sup> complex (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fabrizio et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bessonov et al., 2010</a>) and, upon further remodeling, to the B* complex (<a href=\"#bib67\">Warkocki et al., 2009</a>), in which U6 snRNA forms a central part of the spliceosome's active site. The B* complex facilitates the first step of splicing, the ensuing C complex (<a href=\"#bib29\">Konarska et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bessonov et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fabrizio et al., 2009</a>) catalyzes the second step of splicing, after which the spliceosome releases its products and the remaining snRNPs and non-snRNP factors are recycled."

Association of U4 and U6 snRNPs is mediated in part by base pairing between their respective snRNAs, which form two inter-molecular helices (stems I and II) that are separated by a U4 5\u2032-stem-loop (5\u2032SL; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). U4/U6 base pairing is mutually exclusive with the U6 snRNA conformation in the activated spliceosome. Reannealing of U4 and U6 snRNAs after splicing thus requires the Prp24 assembly chaperone in yeast (<a href=\"#bib51\">Raghunathan and Guthrie, 1998</a>) or its SART3 ortholog in human (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bell et al., 2002</a>), which transiently bind U6 snRNA, as well as the LSm proteins (<a href=\"#bib1\">Achsel et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rader and Guthrie, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Verdone et al., 2004</a>), which bind and remain at the 3\u2032-end of U6 snRNA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beggs, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>).

To test whether the C-terminal U4/U6 di-snRNA-binding region is conserved in yPrp3, we produced a protein comprising the 177 C-terminal residues of yPrp3 (residue 296\u2013469; yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>). yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> bound a yU4/U6 duplex containing the complete stem II and a 13-nt yU6 3\u2032-overhang (yU4/U6<sup>stem II+13nt</sup>) with an apparent dissociation constant (K<sub>d,app</sub>) of 0.92 \u00b5M as determined by EMSA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, first gel and quantification) and with a K<sub>d</sub> of 110 nM as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, top left). The lower apparent affinity estimated by EMSA is likely due to the presence of non-specific tRNA competitor in this assay. The yPrp3 DUF1115 domain (residues 325\u2013469; yPrp3<sup>DUF1115</sup>) lacking the preceding basic peptide showed ca. twofold reduced affinity for yU4/U6<sup>stem II+13nt</sup> in EMSA (K<sub>d,app</sub> 1.83 \u00b5M; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, second gel and quantification) and a ca. 3.5-fold lower affinity in ITC (K<sub>d</sub> 380 \u00b5M; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, top right). Exchange of conserved arginine residues at positions 304 and 322 in the N-terminal basic peptide of yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which could directly interact with the negatively charged RNA backbone, reduced affinities for yU4/U6<sup>stem II+13nt</sup> in both EMSA (K<sub>d,app</sub> 1.58 \u00b5M and 2.63 \u00b5M for yPrp3<sup>CTF,R304A</sup> and yPrp3<sup>CTF,R322A</sup>, respectively; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, third and fourth gels and quantification) and ITC (K<sub>d</sub> 260 nM and 400 nM for yPrp3<sup>CTF,R304A</sup> and yPrp3<sup>CTF,R322A</sup>, respectively; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, bottom left and right) to a similar extent as removal of the entire preceding peptide. Furthermore, the thermodynamic signatures of the interactions involving yPrp3<sup>DUF1115</sup>, yPrp3<sup>CTF,R304A</sup> and yPrp3<sup>CTF,R322A</sup> changed considerably compared to yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>. The DUF1115 domain as well as both arginine-to-alanine variants (in particular yPrp3<sup>CTF,R304A</sup>) exhibited significantly less favorable interaction enthalpies and more favorable (or less unfavorable) interaction entropies compared to yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). One explanation for these observations could be that the N-terminal peptide is a flexible element in yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>, which becomes immobilized (loss in conformational entropy) by RNA contacts (gain in interaction enthalpy) upon binding of yU4/U6<sup>stem II+13nt</sup>. In any case, these observations show that both the DUF1115 domain and the preceding basic peptide contribute to the RNA binding."

Removal of the first two A-U base pairs from the 5\u2032-end of stem II had no consequence for binding of yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, lanes 15\u201318), but reduced binding was seen when seven base pairs, including a non-canonical C69<sup>U6</sup>-C12<sup>U4</sup> pair, were removed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, lane 20). A non-canonical pyrimidine\u2013pyrimidine base pair is conserved in the corresponding stem II regions of U4/U6 from other organisms (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). When we converted yU6 C69 or yU4 C12 of the non-canonical C-C pair in stem II to G\u2019s to allow Watson-Crick base pairing at these positions, the affinity of yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> was reduced about twofold in EMSA titrations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, first and third gels and quantification). In contrast, the DUF1115 domain alone did not exhibit reduced affinity to the mutant RNAs compared to the wt (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, second and fourth gels and quantification). These findings suggest that yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> recognizes portions of the U6 3\u2032-overhang as well as parts of yU4/U6 stem II, including the non-canonical C69<sup>U6</sup>-C12<sup>U4</sup> pair."

The structure exhibits a five-stranded mixed \u03b2-sheet with two \u03b1-helices (\u03b11 and \u03b12) running parallel to the \u03b2-strands on one side of the sheet and one (\u03b13) on the other (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The first 98 residues of the structure (residues 335\u2013432) form a \u03b1/\u03b2 sandwich with a ferredoxin-like topology and an additional, long \u03b2-hairpin (residues 403\u2013421, comprising strands \u03b23a and \u03b23b) inserted between helix \u03b12 and strand \u03b24. The ferredoxin-like fold is further expanded by an extra \u03b2-strand (\u03b25), a helix (\u03b13) and a following loop at the C-terminus. In two of the three independent molecules, the \u03b23a/\u03b23b hairpins adopt very similar conformations with their long axes oriented perpendicular to the direction of the strands in the central \u03b2-sheet. Residues D405 and D418 at the bases of the hairpins coordinate an Yt<sup>3+</sup> ion. The third molecule lacks electron density for large parts of the hairpin (residues 407\u2013421), suggesting that crystal packing and a bound metal ion may have stabilized this normally flexible element in the first two molecules."

In the complex lacking these interactions, the corresponding backbone regions of yU6 and the stem II duplex are slightly pulled away from the protein, presumably by crystal packing interactions. The exocyclic N6 group of A83 approaches the side chain carboxyl of E362 (helix \u03b11) and its base stacks on the side chain of F354 (helix \u03b11; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The extracyclic amino group (N4) of C84 is hydrogen bonded to the backbone carbonyl of E407 (\u03b23a/\u03b23b hairpin) and the base is thereby held sandwiched between H409 (\u03b23a/\u03b23b hairpin) and P350 (helix \u03b11; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The A83 and C84 backbone phosphates approach the side chain of K351 (helix \u03b11; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These interactions splay out A83 and C84, stabilizing the first kink in the yU6 3\u2032-overhang. The guanidinium group of R353 (helix \u03b11) engages in hydrogen bonds to the Watson-Crick face of C85 (atoms O2 and N3) and to the Hoogsteen face of G86 (atoms O6 and N7; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Furthermore, N1 of G86 is contacted by the side chain carboxyl of D374 (\u03b21-\u03b22 loop), its base engages in cation-\u03c0 stacking to the guanidium group of R371 (strand \u03b22) and its 2\u2032-hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the backbone carbonyl of M442 (strand \u03b25; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). O4 of U87 is hydrogen bonded to the side chain amide of Q457 (helix \u03b13) and its base stacks on F441 (strand \u03b25; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). The O2 atom of U88 hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of W440 (strand \u03b25), positioning the base laterally on the F441 side chain. The U87-U88 backbone region encircles the side chain of K357 (helix \u03b11), which contacts the anionic phosphate oxygens of U87 and the O3 atom of U88 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). The interactions involving K357, W440, F441 and Q457 stabilize the second kink in the yU6 3\u2032-overhang. The side chain amino group of K361 (helix \u03b11) contacts the U89 anionic phosphate oxygens in one complex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and interacts with O2, O2\u2032 and O3\u2032 of U88 as well as the phosphate and O5\u2032 of U89 in the other complex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). The last nt, U90, adopts two different conformations in the two complexes; in one case, its N3, O2 and O4 atoms are hydrogen bonded to the side chain hydroxyl of S364 (\u03b13-\u03b22 loop; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), while in the other case it interacts with the N1 and N6 positions of nt A82 at the beginning of the yU6 3\u2032-overhang (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>)."

However, the sequence comparison did not reveal the evolutionary relationship between the Prp3 ssRNA-binding domain and other members of the ferredoxin superfamily. We therefore calculated a phylogenetic tree based on pairwise structural comparisons with representative ferredoxin fold structures (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The tree is in agreement with sequence analyses, showing that the Prp3 ssRNA-binding domain is most similar to AcyP and BLUF domains.

A R399A/F441A double mutant strongly exacerbated this effect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These observations are consistent with the mutated residues contributing to functionally important yPrp3-yU4/U6 interactions, as seen in our binding assays and yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> -yU4/U6<sup>stem II+10nt</sup> crystal structure. To trace the origin of the growth defects, we monitored the effects of the mutations on splicing in vivo at 37\u00b0C, using endogenous U3 (pre-)snoRNA as a reporter. Slight accumulation of unspliced U3 pre-snoRNAs was seen in strains producing the R304A, R399A, R304A/R322A or R399A/F441A variants of yPrp3 compared to the wt (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), indicating that the observed growth defects likely root in inefficient splicing. Finally, monitoring snRNP levels by Northern blotting of cellular extracts spread out on a glycerol gradient showed that the levels of U4/U6 di-snRNP and of isolated U5 snRNP were increased at the expense of U4/U6\u2022U5 tri-snRNP in strains producing Prp3 variants R304A/R322A and R399A/F441A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). At the same time, Western blotting revealed reduced levels of yPrp3 associated with U4/U6\u2022U5 tri-snRNP in the mutant strains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). These results suggest that reduced tri-snRNP levels are the cause of the reduced splicing activity in the mutant strains and that efficient yPrp3 binding to U4/U6 di-snRNAs via its C-terminal region is important for U4/U6\u2022U5 tri-snRNP stability."

Our crystal structure and targeted mutational analyses demonstrate that the DUF1115 domain acts as a ssRNA-binding domain that specifically recognizes the first 10 nts of the U6 3\u2032-overhang. While our structural analysis did not reveal how the preceding peptide is involved in U4/U6 binding, several pieces of evidence indicate that it binds along U4/U6 stem II: The peptide is important for full binding of Prp3 C-terminal portions to U4/U6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>) but it is not a structural element of the DUF1115 domain and thus does not act via stabilizing the RNA-binding fold of DUF1115. Single Arg-to-Ala exchanges in the peptide lead to reduced RNA binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>), indicating that these residues may directly contact the RNA. RNA constructs with shortened stem II or in which a conserved non-canonical base pair was converted to a Watson-Crick pair show reduced binding to Prp3<sup>CTF</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>), which cannot be explained by the observed DUF1115 domain contacts (exclusively to the U6 3\u2032-overhang). Finally, Prp3<sup>CTF</sup>, but not the DUF1115 domain, inhibits Brr2-mediated U4/U6 unwinding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), suggesting that the peptide stabilizes contacts between U4 and U6, presumably by binding the stem II duplex."

DUF1115 exhibits a ferredoxin-like core similar to AcyP/BLUF proteins but evolutionarily remote from other nucleic acid-binding domains in the ferredoxin superfamily. As we failed to detect a DUF1115-like domain by sequence comparisons in hundreds of other RNA-binding proteins recently identified in transcriptome-wide screens (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baltz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Castello et al., 2012</a>), DUF1115 most likely represents a spliceosome-specific ssRNA-binding domain. Due to the pronounced reorientation that the U6 3\u2032-overhang experiences on the surface of the Prp3 DUF1115 domain, the domain likely is an important architectural element in the U4/U6 di-snRNP and/or the U4/U6\u2022U5 tri-snRNP."

Deletion of nts U74-G75-A76 in hU6 snRNA (corresponding to residues U80-G81-A82 in yU6) reduced the levels of U4/U6\u2022U5 tri-snRNP and assembled spliceosomes to less than 10% of wt and abrogated splicing activity (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wolff and Bindereif, 1992</a>). An A76C variant of hU6 snRNA showed reduced interaction with U4 snRNA, concomitant with reduced spliceosome assembly and low splicing activity (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wolff and Bindereif, 1995</a>). Furthermore, yU6 snRNA bearing a U80G exchange almost completely abolished formation of U4/U6 di-snRNPs and U4/U6\u2022U5 tri-snRNPs and was defective in splicing (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fabrizio et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ryan and Abelson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ryan et al., 2002</a>).

The effects of some of these mutations were suggested to root in a stabilization of intra-molecular base pairing in U6 snRNA. However, our observation that G81C and A82C exchanges in yU6 snRNA led to weak binding of yPrp3 in vitro suggests that aberrant Prp3 binding may also contribute to these phenotypes. The continuous stacking of nts in the transition region between stem II and the U6 3\u2032-overhang seen in our structure may properly orient these elements for stable Prp3 binding."

Our results indicate that Prp3 contacts RNA elements along stem II, that is, in the vicinity of the U4/U6 3-way junction. Snu13 binds one branch of the 3-way junction (the U4 5\u2032SL), which could exert a stabilizing effect on the 3-way junction and stem II and lead to improved binding of Prp3. This effect could be further enhanced by Prp31, whose U4/U6 contacts extend into the lower part of stem II (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schultz et al., 2006</a>). It is also conceivable that the Prp3 stem II-binding peptide directly contacts Snu13 and/or Prp31 on the RNAs and that the latter two proteins even modulate how the peptide interacts with stem II."

This recycling requires the Prp24 protein in yeast and the related SART3 protein in human. Recently, a crystal structure of near full-length Prp24 in complex with a large portion of U6 snRNA was elucidated (<a href=\"#bib40\">Montemayor et al., 2014</a>). While not contained in the Prp24-U6 structure, the distal 3\u2032-end of U6 snRNA is available in that complex for binding the LSm proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), consistent with the observation of a stable Prp24-LSm-U6 snRNA complex in yeast (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vidal et al., 1999</a>). In contrast, U6 regions that form stem I, stem II and the U6 3\u2032-overhang in the assembled U4/U6 di-snRNP are sequestered in an internal U6 stem loop (ISL) and by Prp24-U6 interactions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). As Prp24 does not harbor an NTP-dependent RNA helicase activity, the question arises how the U6 ISL can be unwound and U6 handed over from Prp24 to U4 snRNP. Notably, regions of U6 snRNA that form stem II and the U6 3\u2032-overhang in the U4/U6 di-snRNP (i.e., Prp3-binding elements) are largely exposed on the surface of the Prp24-U6 snRNA complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Furthermore, the Prp24-U6 structure represents an artificially stabilized situation, obtained after introducing a cold-sensitive A62G mutation in U6, which impedes unwinding of the U6 ISL (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fortner et al., 1994</a>) by sequestering C85 in a non-natural Watson\u2013Crick base pair (magenta in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We have shown here that C85 is a crucial contact residue of Prp3, which also latches onto the surrounding nts in the context of U4/U6 di-snRNP via its DUF1115 domain. Thus in the wt situation, the U6 ISL on Prp24 can most likely \u201cbreathe\u201d in the region surrounding C85, whereby this region could become available for Prp3 binding. Consistent with this idea, chemical probing studies showed that these Prp3-binding nts are only weakly protected in the Prp24-LSm-U6 snRNA particle (<a href=\"#bib27\">Karaduman et al., 2006</a>). We therefore suggest that binding of Prp3 to its cognate U6 3\u2032-overhang region traps and subsequently extends and stabilizes spontaneous local unwinding of the internal stem loop (ISL) on the Prp24-LSm-U6 snRNA complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

Prp3 could also support this step by stabilizing the emerging U4/U6 stem II via its stem II-binding peptide. Furthermore, the cooperativity we detect in binding of Snu13, Prp31 and Prp3 to U4/U6 di-snRNA may help to complete assembly of the U4/U6 di-snRNP. Taken together, our results support an important role of Prp3 in the handover of U6 snRNA from Prp24 to U4 snRNP during U4/U6 di-snRNP reassembly after splicing."

The tree was visualized with Evolview (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>) and annotated manually."

Regarding the U4-U6 stem-Prp3 interaction, further experimental details should be added, along the lines suggested by Reviewer 3, to strengthen this point. There was also some criticism on the presentation of the data, and both the Introduction, the first part of the Results, and some of the Discussion sections were considered difficult to read, fraught with too many details.

While some useful new information is obtained, e.g. what appears to be a novel RNA biding motif in Prp3, I have some concerns about the impact of the work. These include the fact that interaction between Prp3 and stem II of U4/U6 is not well resolved. Additionally, the relevance of these structures in the absence of Snu13 and Prp31 is questionable given that the three proteins bind U4/U6 cooperatively. It seems quite possible that the presence of Snu13 and or Prp31 could alter the functionally relevant conformation of Prp3."

Their own work on the yeast complex (e.g. <a href=\"#bib46\">Nottrott et al., 2002</a>) had shown that Prp3 contacts the U4-U6 duplex RNA on the U4-U6 stem II and U6-3' terminal regions. Here they extend these data by a combination of data, showing that the C-terminal region of Prp3 protein combines single- and double-stranded RNA-binding functions in corresponding regions: first, the DUF1115 domain at the very C-terminus of Prp3 recognizing the conserved single-stranded U6 3' terminus, preceded by, second, a protein domain that interacts with the double-stranded U4-U6 stem II."

This is used for solving the protein structure in that part of Prp3, in addition also together with a minimal U4-U6 RNA duplex. They are able to resolve the protein-RNA interaction at the U6-3' terminal region, but not at the U4-U6 stem region. RNA-protein contacts are probed and confirmed by mutant analysis. To investigate the protein recognition of the U4-U6 double-stranded region, they use hydroxyl radical footprinting with the minimal U4-U6 RNA fused into one RNA, which supports their model that the Prp3 peptide preceding the C-terminal DUF domain contacts the U4-U6 stem II."

The manuscript is well written and mostly clear although sometimes not easy to follow due to complex nomenclature and description of residue and nucleotide numbers that are not always obvious. The results provide significant novel insight into our understanding of spliceosome assembly but also on protein-RNA recognition. Prp3 recognizes specifically an overhang of U6 snRNA, which is suggested to help to release Prp24 and enable binding to U4 snRNA in conjunction with other factors like Prp31 and Snu13."

Later they add several experiments to support their initial findings about the importance of this region in U4/U6 di-snRNP assembly (maybe a reordering of the manuscript concerning this region could improve the reading flow). From the structure determined by X-ray crystallography it seems plausible that this presumably flexible tail is indeed present in the crystals and stabilizes the complex by contacts to the stem helix. Given that the manuscript mainly focuses on the structural biology of the complex, and that the recognition of the U4/U6 duplex region may also be an important aspect of the Prp3 interactions, it is a little disappointing that no additional efforts were made to further clarify the contribution of these regions for in complex formation.

We have retained a discussion of previous U4/U6 mutagenesis studies, as many of the previously probed residues are directly contacting Prp3 in our crystal structure; however, an influence of the manipulations on Prp3 binding was not considered at that time. Furthermore, we kept a brief discussion of possible mechanisms underlying the cooperative binding of U4/U6-interacting proteins, as we present data directly relating to this point. However, with respect to comments by Reviewer 1, we now briefly mention that the proteins might modulate each other\u2019s interactions with the RNAs upon binding. Finally, although somewhat speculative, we have retained a discussion of a possible role of Prp3 in re-assembly of the U4/U6 di-snRNP. U6 snRNA regions contained in our crystal structures were also seen in a recently published Prp24-U6 snRNA complex structure, in which they take on a different conformation. Having these two structural snapshots in hand, we think it is important to comment on possible mechanisms of how one functional state (Prp24-U6) could interconvert into the other functional state (U4/U6 di-snRNP)."
