Growth cones are attracted to intermediate targets, but they must switch their response upon arrival so that they can move away and complete the next stage of growth. Here, we show that KPC-1, a <i>C. elegans</i> Furin homolog, regulates the level of the branching receptor DMA-1 on dendrites by targeting it to late endosomes. In <i>kpc-1</i> mutants, the level of DMA-1 is abnormally high on dendrites, resulting in trapping of dendrites at locations where a high level of the cognate ligand, the adhesion molecule SAX-7/L1, is present. The misregulation of DMA-1 also causes dendritic self-avoidance defects. Thus, precise regulation of guidance receptors creates flexibility of responses to guidance signals and is critical for neuronal morphogenesis."

Growth cones are attracted to intermediate targets, but they must switch their response upon arrival so that they can move away and complete the next stage of growth. Here, we show that KPC-1, a <i>C. elegans</i> Furin homolog, regulates the level of the branching receptor DMA-1 on dendrites by targeting it to late endosomes. In <i>kpc-1</i> mutants, the level of DMA-1 is abnormally high on dendrites, resulting in trapping of dendrites at locations where a high level of the cognate ligand, the adhesion molecule SAX-7/L1, is present. The misregulation of DMA-1 also causes dendritic self-avoidance defects. Thus, precise regulation of guidance receptors creates flexibility of responses to guidance signals and is critical for neuronal morphogenesis."

First, genetic mutations were identified that distort the shape of the dendrites of touch-sensing neurons in a simple worm called <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. These neurons lacked the equivalent of an enzyme called Furin and had abnormally high amounts of a receptor protein called DMA-1 on their surfaces. This suggests that controlling the receptor level on dendrites creates flexibility in the guidance choices of dendrites."

Reducing the number of receptors at the surface of the cell in this way prevents the neuron from responding to the guidance signals at wrong locations. In the future, more studies are needed to understand how the neuron checks and balances this process and how it eventually is turned off."

Extracellular cues provide neurites with instructive spatial signals to guide their growth, turning and branching decisions. Different neurons can interpret the same cue differently based on the receptors they express. Many guidance cues support both attractive and repulsive responses, which are mediated by different classes of receptors (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</a>). Axon guidance is achieved not only through cell-specific expression of receptors but also by dynamic regulation of those receptors during neural development."

                        "text": "A classical example of spatial and temporal regulation of guidance receptors is midline crossing in the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> central nervous system (CNS). In the fly nerve cord, many neurons extend their axons across the midline to the contralateral side while others remain on the ipsilateral side (<a href=\"#bib11\">Harris et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kolodziej et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mitchell et al., 1996</a>). This process critically depends on the midline repellent Slit, its receptor Roundabout (Robo) and another protein Commissureless (Comm) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kidd et al., 1998a</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">1998b</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brose et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 1999</a>). Slit is secreted by midline cells and repels growth cones expressing the Robo receptor. Longitudinal axons that do not cross contain high levels of Robo and are kept away from the midline (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kidd et al., 1999</a>). Comm, on the other hand, functions in the contralaterally projecting commissural neurons to keep the level of Robo low before commissural axons cross the midline, during which the growth cones need to ignore the repellent Slit. The expression of Comm diminishes after growth cones cross the midline, allowing the Robo receptors to localize onto the plasma membrane of postcrossing growth cones so that the axons can be repelled away from the midline and prevented from recrossing (<a href=\"#bib17\">Keleman et al., 2002</a>). It has been shown that Comm sorts the Robo receptors to endosomal pathways before they reach the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib17\">Keleman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">2005</a>). Similarly, in the vertebrate spinal cord, where no Comm homologue is found, differential responses to the midline repellant Slit is achieved by regulated expression and alternative splicing of the Robo3 receptor isoforms (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sabatier et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2008</a>). Pre-crossing axons contain high levels of Robo3.1, which prevents the activation of the Robo1 and Robo2 receptors, thereby allowing axons to grow toward the highly repulsive midline. Upon crossing, Robo3.2 expression is switched on, and it acts in concert with Robo1 and Robo2 to keep axons from recrossing the midline. It remains unknown, however, how neurons achieve such spatiotemporal specificity, and the mechanisms by which Comm and Robo3 are regulated remain unclear (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dickson and Gilestro, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ypsilanti et al., 2010</a>)."

                        "text": "We have previously reported that dendrites of the PVD neurons in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans</i>) follow precisely localized guidance signals SAX-7 and MNR-1 to form highly organized dendritic structures (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Salzberg et al., 2013</a>). SAX-7 is the ortholog of the vertebrate neuronal adhesion molecule L1CAM (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zallen et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2001</a>). PVD neurons first grow two longitudinally extending 1\u00b0 dendrites, from which numerous 2\u00b0 dendrites emerge roughly perpendicular to the 1\u00b0 dendrites (<a href=\"#bib38\">Smith et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Albeg et al., 2011</a>). Upon reaching two sublateral lines where the guidance molecule SAX-7 is highly enriched (arrows in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), the PVD dendrites form stereotyped 'T'-shaped 3\u00b0 branches. SAX-7 and MNR-1 are both necessary and sufficient to instruct dendrite morphogenesis through direct interactions with the PVD receptor DMA-1 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu and Shen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Salzberg et al., 2013</a>). SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1 form a tripartite ligand-receptor signaling complex that enables stereotyped dendritic branch formation and stabilization. A close examination of SAX-7 localization revealed that, in addition to the sublateral stripes where 3\u00b0 branches form, SAX-7 was also enriched in a zone that roughly lined up with the 1\u00b0 branches (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, arrowhead) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dong et al., 2013</a>). Since SAX-7 is expressed and localized well before PVD dendrite morphogenesis begins (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dong et al., 2013</a>), the 2\u00b0 dendrites encounter the SAX-7 domain as they emerge from the 1\u00b0 dendrite. In wild-type animals, the vast majority of 2\u00b0 dendrites grow out of the SAX-7 domain to reach the sublateral line and form 3\u00b0\u00a0branches there. How emerging 2\u00b0 dendrites 'escape' one attractive SAX-7 domain but grow along another SAX-7 domain is conceptually similar to how the commissural neurons dynamically adjust their axon guidance response to Slit in <i>Drosophila</i> and mouse during midline crossing."

KPC-1 is a member of the paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme (PACE) family of proprotein convertases and is shown to be required autonomously in the PVD neurons for menorah formation. Genetic analyses showed that mutations in the SAX-7/MNR-1/DMA-1 complex were epistatic to <i>kpc-1</i> mutations (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schroeder et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Salzberg et al., 2014</a>). However, the functional mechanism of KPC-1 and its relationship with the receptor-ligand complex remain elusive. It is also unclear why weak hypomorphic alleles of <i>kpc-1</i> exhibit defects in self-avoidance of the 3\u00b0 branches (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schroeder et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Salzberg et al., 2014</a>). Here, we show that KPC-1, instead of promoting branch outgrowth as proposed in the previous papers, enables the dendrites to move away from the high level of SAX-7 at intermediate targets. Our genetic, biochemical, and cell biological analyses indicate that KPC-1 supports dendrite pathfinding by maintaining a proper level of the DMA-1 receptor on the plasma membrane of dendrites. Loss of KPC-1 causes unregulated and excessive DMA-1, leading to erroneous dendrite guidance choices. These findings present a new mechanism that modulates the neuronal dendrites\u2019 response to extracellular adhesion molecules through controlling the trafficking of dendrite guidance receptors."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, YFP tagged SAX-7 expressed in the hypodermal cell was highly enriched in two longitudinal sublateral stripes (arrows) which precisely co-localized with the PVD 3\u00b0 branches labeled by mCherry. In addition to these lines, SAX-7 also showed strong enrichment at ring-shaped structures that likely represented the junctions between seam cells (labeled by CFP using a seam cell-specific promoter P<i>nhr-81</i>) and the major hypodermal syncytium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, arrowhead). The seam cells are two rows of specialized hypodermal cells that line up along the lateral midlines of the worms and cover a region in which longitudinal PVD 1\u00b0 dendrites extend (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</a>). The location of this SAX-7 zone dictated that PVD 2\u00b0 branches would encounter an area with a high level of the adhesion molecule SAX-7 as they grow away from the 1\u00b0 dendrite."

We reasoned that disabling the normal escaping mechanism would lead to trapping of PVD dendrites within the zone. Indeed, in our forward genetic screen for mutants with defects in PVD morphology, we isolated three mutants, <i>wy916, wy920</i> and <i>wy936</i>, which showed a dramatic phenotype in which PVD dendrites were completely trapped near the 1\u00b0 dendrites. This phenotype resembled that of a previously reported mutant allele <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schroeder et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Salzberg et al., 2014</a>).

Co-labeling of the PVD neuron, hypodermal SAX-7-YFP and the seam cells revealed that the 2\u00b0 dendrites in <i>kpc-1</i> mutants were trapped inside the area with enriched SAX-7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We quantified the percentage of 2\u00b0 dendrites that failed to extend beyond the seam cell zone near the 1\u00b0 dendrite and found that the <i>kpc-1</i> mutants had a significantly larger portion of dendrites that were trapped in this zone than wild-type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Expressing KPC-1 in PVD using the PVD-specific <i>ser2prom3</i> promoter fully rescued the dendritic defects, while expressing KPC-1 in hypodermal and muscle cells failed to rescue the phenotypes, consistent with previous reports that KPC-1 was expressed and functioned autonomously in the PVD neuron (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schroeder et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Salzberg et al., 2014</a>)."

Heat shock expression of KPC-1 at different developmental time points caused drastically different effects (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Expressing KPC-1 during L1 or L2 larval stages before the outgrowth PVD 2\u00b0 branches did not modify the <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> mutant phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,D</a>). Expression of KPC-1 during the early L3 stage, in contrast, during 2\u00b0 branch outgrowth, produced robust rescue of all dendritic branches: 2\u00b0 branches were able to grow out of the high SAX-7 region around the seam cells and formed full menorahs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,D</a>). Heat shock expression during later stages produced an altered phenotype in which the branches that were trapped and stabilized before KPC-1 expression remained trapped in the region while the newly developed branches could grow out and form 3\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 branches (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). These results agreed with a previous report using temporal RNAi (<a href=\"#bib35\">Salzberg et al., 2014</a>) and demonstrated that KPC-1 was required during a stringent time window when the 2\u00b0 branches synchronously bypassed the high level SAX-7 region to allow proper outgrowth."

Alternatively, if KPC-1 was required for dendritic outgrowth per se, double mutants between <i>kpc-1</i> and any member of the ligand-receptor complex would show a PVD dendritic phenotype that was similar to that of the <i>kpc-1</i> mutants. Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schroeder et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Salzberg et al., 2014</a>), we observed that the <i>kpc-1; sax-7, kpc-1; mnr-1</i> and <i>kpc-1; dma-1</i> double mutants showed PVD morphologies indistinguishable from those of the <i>sax-7, mnr-1</i> or <i>dma-1</i> single mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Instead of remaining within a tight zone close to the 1\u00b0 dendrites like in the <i>kpc-1</i> single mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), 2\u00b0 dendrites of the double mutants extended further out in both dorsal and ventral directions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>). Since the dendritic morphologies of the <i>sax-7, mnr-1</i> and <i>dma-1</i> mutants were highly disorganized with many short ectopic 2\u00b0 branches, there were more 2\u00b0 branches in the 'trap zone' compared with the wild-type animals (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2H</a>). Nevertheless, the percentages of trapped dendrites in the double mutants were comparable to those of single mutants of the tripartite complex but were significantly lower than that in the <i>kpc-1</i> single mutants (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2H</a>).

We next directly tested this hypothesis by ectopically expressing SAX-7 in seam cells in <i>kpc-1; sax-7</i> double mutants. In striking contrast to the double mutants themselves (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), the PVD dendrites in the <i>kpc-1; sax-7</i> double mutants expressing SAX-7 in seam cells were trapped in the seam cell area, with very few 2\u00b0 branches reaching far from the 1\u00b0 dendrite (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,G</a>). These results further supported the notion that the dendritic trapping phenotype in the <i>kpc-1</i> mutants was due to the excessive activity of the SAX-7/MNR-1/DMA-1 complex near the seam cells. We also ectopically expressed SAX-7 and MNR-1 in the ALM and PLM neurons in the <i>sax-7; kpc-1</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). ALM and PLM neurons have long neurites that extend in the dorsal and ventral sublateral nerve cords and overlap with the locations where PVD 3\u00b0 branches form and grow. This ectopic expression converted the <i>sax-7</i> mutant-like dendritic pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) to a striking new pattern: the entire PVD dendritic arbor followed the PLM and ALM neurites (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>)."

                                "text": "Similar to <i>sax-7; kpc-1</i>, PVD morphologies of the double mutants between <i>dma-1</i> and <i>kpc-1</i> also clearly resembled the <i>dma-1</i> but not <i>kpc-1</i> single mutants, with disrupted organization and complete loss of menorahs but no trapping phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B,C and H</a>). The trapping model also predicted that resupplying DMA-1 to <i>dma-1; kpc-1</i> double mutants during the outgrowth of 2\u00b0 branches within the trapping zone would restore the trapping phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, middle panel) while expression after the 2\u00b0 branches reached beyond the trapping zone would not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, right panel). To test this, we utilized the heat shock promoter to express DMA-1 at different time points in <i>dma-1; kpc-1</i> mutants. Consistent with our hypothesis, providing DMA-1 during early L3 when the 2\u00b0 branches grew within the trap zone led to robust restoration of the trapping phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,H</a>). On the contrary, expressing DMA-1 at later time points, when most of the branches in <i>dma-1</i> mutants had already extended beyond the trapping zone, led to a striking rescue of 3\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 branches (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,H</a>), again demonstrating strongly that dendrites in the <i>kpc-1</i> mutants did not lack outgrowth capability and maintained intact SAX-7/MNR-1/DMA-1 signaling. Instead, the <i>kpc-1</i> mutant PVD dendrites responded excessively to the guidance cues SAX-7 and MNR-1 near the seam cells, which limited their growth to the 'trap zone'."

Unlike a previously reported mutation of the same amino acid (<i>kpc-1(my24),</i> P440L) which gave rise to a null phenotype, the PVD neurons of the <i>kpc-1(xr58)</i> mutants showed a fully penetrant, complex phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schroeder et al., 2013</a>). Similar to the complete loss-of-function <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3D</a>), some 2\u00b0 dendrites in <i>kpc-1(xr58)</i> mutants were trapped near the 1\u00b0 dendrites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, asterisks, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The 2\u00b0 dendrite trapping phenotype was much weaker than that in the <i>gk8</i> allele yet significantly different from that in the wild-type animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3A\u2013B</a>). Unlike the PVD dendrites of the <i>kpc-1</i> null mutants, which failed to make any intact menorahs, many 2\u00b0 dendrites in the <i>kpc-1(xr58)</i> mutants, especially those in the proximal region near the cell body, could successfully extend away from the 1\u00b0 dendrite and formed full menorahs with T-shaped 3\u00b0 branches and many 4\u00b0 branches on them. However, the 3\u00b0 branches in this mutant had a striking self-avoidance defect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, arrowheads). In wild-type animals, 3\u00b0 branches showed stringent self-avoidance. Neighboring 3\u00b0 dendrites almost never overlapped with each other and instead showed gaps in between (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, arrows). The self-avoidance phenotype of the <i>xr58</i> allele was similar to that of two previously reported weak alleles of <i>kpc-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Salzberg et al., 2014</a>) whose 3\u00b0 dendrites remained in the same 2D plane but showed extensive overlap. We quantified the percentage of 'T'-shaped 3\u00b0 dendrites that made contact with their neighbors and found that around 70% of 3\u00b0 branches had self-avoidance defects in the <i>kpc-1(xr58)</i> mutants, compared to only 2% in wild-type worms (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In addition to the self-avoidance defects of the 3\u00b0 branches, <i>kpc-1(xr58)</i> also had a reduced number of 4\u00b0 branches. Except in the most proximal menorah (closest to the cell body), the 4\u00b0 dendrites were largely absent from the menorahs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, stars, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

Injecting a mutated version of <i>kpc-1</i> cDNA containing the P440S mutation into the null <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> deletion mutants produced a dendritic phenotype that was milder than <i>gk8</i> but indistinguishable from that of <i>kpc-1(xr58)</i>, suggesting that the <i>xr58</i> allele was a hypomorphic allele (data not shown). Second, expressing the wild-type <i>kpc-1</i> cDNA at a very low concentration in the <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> null allele resulted in a PVD morphology that was similar to that of the <i>xr58</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D and E</a>). Third, RNAi against <i>kpc-1</i> also gave rise to a similar PVD dendritic phenotype to that of <i>xr58</i> (data not shown). Since RNAi was often inefficient in worm neurons, this result further supported the notion that the <i>kpc-1(xr58)</i> phenotype represented a partial loss of KPC-1 activity in the PVD neuron."

In other words, in wild-type animals, the growth of both the 2\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 dendrites required them to move away from the high SAX-7 regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>).

Indeed, when the worm KPC-1 was expressed in cultured <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells, we found two protein products that corresponded to full-length and Pro domain-cleaved KPC-1 based on size (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). With sequence analysis, we identified two adjacent putative cleavage sites in the N-terminus of KPC-1 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, right panel). We mutated both sites with R to A mutations and found that the resulting mutant protein completely lacked the self-cleavage product when expressed in S2 cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), suggesting that these two sites were indeed responsible for the self-cleavage of KPC-1. To assess the physiological function of these cleavage sites, we introduced these two mutations into the endogenous <i>kpc-1</i> locus using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<a href=\"#bib29\">Paix et al., 2014</a>). The mutants exhibited a PVD dendritic phenotype indistinguishable from that of the <i>gk8</i> null mutants (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), demonstrating the necessity of Pro domain cleavage for the activation of KPC-1. Furthermore, we artificially deleted the Pro domain and expressed this mutant form in the <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> null allele to test if this truncated version of KPC-1 still retained its activity. Consistent with our hypothesis, KPC-1 lacking the Pro domain could fully rescue the <i>gk8</i> mutants. Both secondary trapping and menorah outgrowth phenotypes were restored to wild-type level (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,D and E</a>). Since the <i>xr58</i> mutation was in the protease domain, we hypothesized that the partial loss of function might be due to inefficient self-cleavage. To test this, we engineered the same P440S mutation into the Pro domain deleted version of KPC-1 and expressed this construct in <i>kpc-1(xr58)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, right panel). Since it was no longer necessary to remove the Pro domain and self-activate, we expected this mutant form to bypass the catalytic defect of <i>xr58</i> and restore normal dendritic morphology. KPC-1\u0394ProP440S fully rescued the 2\u00b0 branch trapping phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C and D</a>) and partially restored the number of 4\u00b0 branches (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C and E</a>).

                                "text": "We utilized several approaches to directly examine DMA-1 in <i>kpc-1</i> mutants. First, we visualized the DMA-1 protein with an integrated reporter expressing <i>gfp</i>-tagged <i>dma-1</i> genomic DNA driven by the PVD-specific <i>ser2prom3</i> promoter. This transgenic reporter allowed us to monitor the amount of DMA-1 receptors at precise locations in the entire PVD dendritic arbor. In wild-type animals, diffuse DMA-1-GFP fluorescence was localized to all dendritic compartments including the higher order branches (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Discrete GFP puncta could also be found in the cell body and 1\u00b0 dendrites, which were likely secretory or endocytic vesicles that carry DMA-1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, right panel). In wild-type neurons, DMA-1-GFP intensity in the discrete puncta was significantly higher than the diffuse staining in the dendrites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In the <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> mutants, we observed a striking increase in the diffuse DMA-1-GFP intensity in the entire dendritic arbor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Quantification of the brightness of diffuse DMA-1-GFP on the dendrite, which was likely membrane-localized DMA-1-GFP, showed a dramatic increase in the <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> allele compared with wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). A similar but less dramatic increase in DMA-1-GFP intensity was observed for the weak allele <i>kpc-1(xr58)</i> as well (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Such up-regulation could be completely rescued by PVD autonomous expression of KPC-1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). To quantify the total DMA-1-GFP protein level, we performed Western blot analysis using an antibody against GFP and confirmed that there was indeed an overall increase in DMA-1 protein level in the <i>kpc-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Furthermore, we monitored endogenous DMA-1 by engineering a YFP into the <i>dma-1</i> genomic locus using CRISPR (<a href=\"#bib29\">Paix et al., 2014</a>). Despite dim fluorescence intensity, we were able to visualize the endogenous expression and observed a DMA-1 localization pattern similar to what we saw using high copy transgenes, with both membrane and vesicular distribution of the protein (data not shown). When we crossed the <i>dma-1::yfp</i> knockin strain into <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i>, we again observed dramatic increase in DMA-1-YFP intensity in the double mutants (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Similarly, a 2xFLAG tag was inserted in frame into the endogenous locus of <i>dma-1</i> using CRISPR (<a href=\"#bib29\">Paix et al., 2014</a>), and we again measured significant up-regulation of DMA-1 protein level in <i>kpc-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). As a control, we examined the fluorescent intensity and localization of HPO-30, another transmembrane protein important for PVD development (<a href=\"#bib37\">Smith et al., 2013</a>), and observed no significant change in its dendritic levels in the <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> mutants despite severe morphology defects (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). We also performed qPCR and found that there was no difference in <i>dma-1</i> transcript level between wild-type and <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). These results further supported the notion that KPC-1 specifically down-regulated the DMA-1 protein level without affecting transcription."

We suspected that the very high level of DMA-1 on the dendritic membrane caused by both the lack of KPC-1 and the DMA-1 overexpression transgene might saturate the SAX-7/MNR-1 ligands in the region, allowing the dendrites to escape. To test this hypothesis, we further overexpressed SAX-7 and MNR-1 in the hypodermal cells in this genetic background, and indeed saw that the dendrites were trapped near the seam cells again (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

First, overexpressing DMA-1 in the <i>kpc-1(xr58)</i> allele further enhanced the dendritic phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The 3\u00b0 branches in these animals showed an even more severe self-avoidance defect than the <i>kpc-1(xr58)</i> worms, and the number of 4\u00b0 branches was further reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Second, we found that overexpression of a truncated version of DMA-1 lacking its entire cytosolic domain generated a dramatic trapping phenotype that mimicked that of the <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> null mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). In these animals, 2\u00b0 dendrites were short and trapped around the 1\u00b0 dendrite. We suspected that the cytosolic domain of DMA-1 may contain signaling motifs that were important for its endocytosis, so overexpressing a DMA-1 construct which lacked these motifs led to higher level of DMA-1 on the dendritic membrane than overexpression of the full length DMA-1 did, thereby produced a more severe trapping phenotype. The same construct, when expressed at a much lower level could partially rescue the <i>dma-1</i> mutant phenotype by allowing the formation of 3\u00b0 and a small number of 4\u00b0 branches (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We also generated a similar mutant allele of <i>dma-1</i> lacking its cytosolic domain using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<a href=\"#bib10\">Friedland et al., 2013</a>) and observed a similar phenotype. 2\u00b0 and 3\u00b0 branches of these mutants developed normally, suggesting that this truncated protein was partially functional (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,C</a>). Interestingly, removing KPC-1 in this genetic background resulted in a severe trapping phenotype, indicating that KPC-1 did not regulate DMA-1 through its cytosolic domain and that the extracellular domain of DMA-1 was sufficient to respond to SAX-7/MNR-1 and to generate trapping (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The striking similarity between the <i>kpc-1</i> null and the strain overexpressing the truncated DMA-1 shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, together with the observation that the\u00a0loss of DMA-1 suppressed the trapping phenotype of the <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> mutant allele, argued strongly that the overabundance of the DMA-1 receptor was responsible for the phenotypes in the loss-of-function alleles of <i>kpc-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>)."

As we have reported previously, when DMA-1-RFP expressing cells were mixed with cells co-expressing SAX-7-GFP and MNR-1-GFP, the red and green cells formed clusters that indicated direct interaction between the DMA-1 receptor and the SAX-7/MNR-1 complex <i>in trans</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, arrows, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dong et al., 2013</a>). Co-transfection of KPC-1 with DMA-1 in the same cells completely blocked cell aggregation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). We then directly examined the amount of DMA-1 in the cells by probing for Myc-tagged DMA-1 with an anti-Myc antibody on Western blots, and found that, consistent with what we have observed in worms, the DMA-1 level was diminished in the cells co-expressing KPC-1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). Another type I transmembrane protein mCD8 was co-transfected in the same cell cultures and was not affected, showing that the effect of KPC-1 on DMA-1 was specific. This result showed that KPC-1 down-regulated DMA-1 not only in worm neurons but also in <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells."

                                "text": "Receptor down-regulation is often achieved by targeting the transmembrane proteins to endosomal pathways either from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or via endocytosis from the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib16\">Katzmann et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Maxfield and McGraw, 2004</a>). We first asked whether DMA-1 was targeted to late endosomes and lysosomes in wild-type worms. An extrachromosomal array expressing mCherry-RAB-7 marker which labeled the late endosomes/lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Poteryaev et al., 2010</a>) was co-expressed with the integrated DMA-1-GFP line to visualize DMA-1 and the late endosomes simultaneously. Indeed, the intracellular DMA-1-GFP puncta showed a high degree of co-localization with mCherry-RAB-7 in wild-type PVD neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Around 80% of RAB-7 vesicles co-localized with DMA-1-GFP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). This result indicated that DMA-1 was indeed targeted to late endosomes in wild-type animals. In contrast, in <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> mutant animals, concomitant with the increased DMA-1-GFP level on the dendritic membrane, there was reduced co-localization between DMA-1-GFP and RAB-7 vesicles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,E</a>). We hypothesized that surface DMA-1 could be down-regulated via two distinct mechanisms: One that required the cytosolic domain of DMA-1 but was independent of KPC-1, and the KPC-1 pathway. The fact that overexpression of cytosolic truncated DMA-1 produced a much stronger gain-of-function phenotype than full length DMA-1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) argued that cytosolic region-mediated endocytosis of DMA-1 might help to down-regulate its level on the plasma membrane. Indeed, DMA-1\u0394cyto-GFP exhibited much stronger membrane localization when expressed at comparable levels as the full length protein (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). We then quantified the co-localization between mCherry-RAB-7 and DMA-1\u0394cyto-GFP and observed a reduction in the percentage of RAB-7 vesicles containing GFP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C and E</a>). Furthermore, when we crossed the integrated transgene expressing DMA-1\u0394cyto-GFP into <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> mutants, the GFP signal appeared almost exclusively on the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Very few vesicles were seen throughout the dendritic arbor and only 10% of late endosomes labeled by mCherry-RAB-7 contained DMA-1\u0394cyto-GFP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D and E</a>). Since both DMA-1 and KPC-1 were predicted to be type I transmembrane proteins, and since the down-regulation of DMA-1 by KPC-1 did not require the cytosolic domain, we reasoned that KPC-1 might target DMA-1 for degradation through directly interacting with its extracellular domain. To test this hypothesis, DMA-1 and KPC-1 ectodomains were expressed using baculoviruses in High Five cells and purified. Direct binding between these proteins was detected with an apparent dissociation constant of 33 \u00b5M using biolayer interferometry (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>, blue circles). No binding was detected between DMA-1 and the negative control, the ectodomain of human GPR56 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>, open rectangles)."

It has been shown by the classic studies on axon guidance that the same ligand can trigger a variety of responses in different neuronal types depending on the membrane receptor contents of their growth cones. Netrin functions as a chemoattractant when binding to the UNC-40/DCC receptor but repels axons containing an UNC-5 and UNC-40/DCC receptor complex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hedgecock et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hong et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Powell et al., 2008</a>). In regions of the nervous system that are wired in a topographic fashion such as the superior colliculus in the visual system, the relative level of Eph receptors dictates where in the Ephrin gradient an axon stops (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cheng et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wilkinson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mann et al., 2002</a>). Even the same neuron can respond to a ligand differently at different decision points during development. In <i>Drosophila</i>, Comm functions in pre-crossing commissural axons to keep the Robo receptor level low by sorting the receptors into endosomes, whereas Comm is turned off after the axon has crossed the midline and the Robo receptor is restored on the surface of growth cones to gain responsiveness to the midline repellent Slit and prevent axons from recrossing (<a href=\"#bib17\">Keleman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Keleman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dickson and Gilestro, 2006</a>). Similarly, commissural axons in the mammalian spinal cord change their responses to Slit by altering their expression of the Robo3 splicing isoforms. (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sabatier et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2008</a>). Hence, the temporal and spatial regulation of receptors is critical to achieving precise neural development."

Dendritic morphologies of the <i>kpc-1; sax-7/mnr-1/dma-1</i> double mutants were indistinguishable from the <i>sax-7, mnr-1</i> or <i>dma-1</i> single mutants but were drastically different from the <i>kpc-1</i> null mutants. Thus, the outgrowth defect of <i>kpc-1</i> mutants was due to the trapping of dendrites caused by excessive response to SAX-7 and MNR-1. To further confirm this model, we used ectopic expression of SAX-7 to manipulate ligand distribution and tested if that was sufficient to cause a predictable trapping pattern. Indeed, we could trap the <i>kpc-1</i> mutant dendrites ectopically by expressing SAX-7 and MNR-1 in seam cells or PLM and ALM neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Also, when we expressed the DMA-1 receptor at a late developmental stage in <i>dma-1; kpc-1</i> double mutants when dendrites had 'escaped' from the trap zone, menorah structures could be largely rescued, showing that PVD\u2019s ability to extend dendrites and respond to the ligand complex was intact in <i>kpc-1</i> mutants."

Overexpression of a cytoplasmic domain deleted version of DMA-1 mimicked the <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), showing that the dendritic defects of <i>kpc-1</i> mutants could be attributed to excessive amounts of DMA-1 on the membrane. In the weak <i>kpc-1(xr58)</i> allele, overexpression of DMA-1 enhanced the 3\u00b0 self-avoidance and the 4\u00b0 outgrowth phenotypes, which further supported the notion that the phenotypes arose as a result of elevation in DMA-1 level."

                                "text": "How does KPC-1 down-regulate DMA-1? Both proteins are predicted to be type I transmembrane proteins, with KPC-1 having a C-terminal transmembrane domain but no cytosolic domain. The topology of these proteins suggested that KPC-1 could cleave DMA-1\u2019s ectodomain at specific sites and inactivate DMA-1. We could not, however, identify any consensus Furin cleavage sites in the DMA-1 protein sequence. Likewise, we did not observe any truncated product of DMA-1 in the presence of KPC-1 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Instead, we observed a reduction in the total amount of DMA-1 when KPC-1 was co-expressed in systems that we examined. These results suggested that KPC-1 did not cleave DMA-1 but rather down-regulated DMA-1 via a different mechanism. We also found that, consistent with the proteins\u2019 topologies, the regulation of DMA-1 by KPC-1 did not require its cytosolic domain, since double mutants between a <i>dma-1</i> allele lacking its cytosolic domain <i>dma-1(wy908)</i> and <i>kpc-1(gk8)</i> still showed strong trapping phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We therefore hypothesized that KPC-1 functioned similarly to another member of the mammalian convertase family, PCSK9, which down-regulated the LDL receptor through directly binding to its extracellular EGF domain and targeting the receptor to the endocytic pathway for degradation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lagace et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Poirier and Mayer, 2013</a>). Consistent with this model, we detected direct interaction between the ectodomains of DMA-1 and KPC-1 and observed that KPC-1 localized to the late endosomes and lysosomes when expressed in S2R+ cells."

This function is necessary to allow developing dendrites to move away from the intermediate targets where the guidance cues SAX-7 and MNR-1 are highly enriched before reaching their final destinations. These results demonstrate that precise regulation of receptor levels is critical for dendrite branching and patterning."

Dong et al. now show that KPC-1 regulates the levels of the LRR receptor DMA-1 via late endosomal pathway to guide PVD dendrites. Although their findings that <i>kpc-1</i> acts cell autonomously at L3 stage for PVD dendrite morphogenesis are consistent with the published work by Salzberg et al., they present a different interpretation for the mutant phenotype, described as dendrite trapping, due to high signaling of the DMA-1 receptor in <i><span class=\"underline\">kpc-1</span></i> mutants. Supporting their conclusion, they show that <i>kpc-1</i> mutants increase expression levels of DMA-1 and overexpression of <i>kpc-1</i> can prevent DMA-1 from interacting with its ligands SAX-7 and MNR-1. DMA-1 can be found in RAB-7 containing endosomes in PVD neurons. <i>kpc-1</i> appears to colocalize with RAB-7 in S2 cells, and promotes DMA-1 localization to late endosomes in PVD. Yet, the regulation of DMA-1 by KPC-1 does not require the intracellular domain of DMA-1. Overall, the data linking <i>kpc-1</i> to <i>dma-1</i> are strong, and offer new insights to dendrite morphogenesis and regulation of DMA-1. An issue is that the temporal regulation of DMA-1 by <i>kpc-1</i> during PVD dendrite outgrowth is mainly inferred through transgenic overexpression studies. The presentation of some data needs further clarification. Several figures lack quantification or controls."

The work lacks any mechanistic insights into how KPC-1 targets DMA-1 to endosomes/lysosomes; and it does not convincingly show that this is the correct model. We find out that this targeting cannot be demonstrated to occur through cleavage of DMA-1 by KPC-1, which would be the obvious model. But this is negative evidence based on the lack of a detectable DMA-1 cleavage product. But, no experiments are done to prove that KPC-1 does not cleave DMA-1, or to validate the idea that KPC-1 might bind directly to DMA-1 without cleaving it. The lack of a detectable DMA-1 cleavage product might occur because the product is highly unstable."

The work lacks any mechanistic insights into how KPC-1 targets DMA-1 to endosomes/lysosomes; and it does not convincingly show that this is the correct model. We find out that this targeting cannot be demonstrated to occur through cleavage of DMA-1 by KPC-1, which would be the obvious model. But this is negative evidence based on the lack of a detectable DMA-1 cleavage product. But, no experiments are done to prove that KPC-1 does not cleave DMA-1, or to validate the idea that KPC-1 might bind directly to DMA-1 without cleaving it. The lack of a detectable DMA-1 cleavage product might occur because the product is highly unstable. In addition, it should be relatively simple to use the tagged proteins that have been made, express them in S2 cells and show that they physically interact. Obviously, if the proteins are internalized and degraded too quickly, this may not be feasible. A time course experiment may then be needed. Alternatively, If the interaction is too weak, the method developed by Chris Garcia and colleagues on their campus could be used.</i> "

We have collaborated with Dr Engin \u00d6zkan, former postdoc in the Garcia lab and now assistant professor at the University of Chicago, to specifically test the hypothesis that KPC-1 may target DMA-1 for degradation through directly binding to its ectodomain, a mechanism similar to how PCSK9 down-regulates LDLR. We have successfully expressed and purified predicted extracellular domains of DMA-1 and KPC-1. We have detected direct interaction between these ectodomains using biolayer interferometry (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). The dissociation constant (KD) measured is 33\u03bcM, which explains why it has been difficult for us to detect this weak interaction using low amounts of non-purified proteins on Western blots."

In these experiments, we try to label the plasma membrane fraction of DMA-1 with Fluorogen activating protein (FAP) and follow its endocytosis with live cell imaging. Due to technical difficulties, we are still troubleshooting these experiments. Meanwhile, we show unambiguously <i>in vivo</i> that KPC-1, which interacts with the ectodomain of DMA-1, functions synergistically with other endocytic mechanisms that utilize the cytosolic domain of DMA-1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A-E</a>). We thus hope that we have provided sufficient evidence that KPC-1 down-regulates DMA-1 by targeting it to endocytic compartments."
