We report here the structure of the TOG2 domain from Stu2p bound to yeast \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. Like TOG1, TOG2 binds selectively to a fully \u2018curved\u2019 conformation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin, incompatible with a microtubule lattice. We also show that TOG1-TOG2 binds non-cooperatively to two \u03b1\u03b2-tubulins. Preferential interactions between TOGs and fully curved \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin that cannot exist elsewhere in the microtubule explain how these polymerases localize to the extreme microtubule end. We propose that these polymerases promote elongation because their linked TOG domains concentrate unpolymerized \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin near curved subunits already bound at the microtubule end. This tethering model can explain catalyst-like behavior and also predicts that the polymerase action changes the configuration of the microtubule end."

We report here the structure of the TOG2 domain from Stu2p bound to yeast \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. Like TOG1, TOG2 binds selectively to a fully \u2018curved\u2019 conformation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin, incompatible with a microtubule lattice. We also show that TOG1-TOG2 binds non-cooperatively to two \u03b1\u03b2-tubulins. Preferential interactions between TOGs and fully curved \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin that cannot exist elsewhere in the microtubule explain how these polymerases localize to the extreme microtubule end. We propose that these polymerases promote elongation because their linked TOG domains concentrate unpolymerized \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin near curved subunits already bound at the microtubule end. This tethering model can explain catalyst-like behavior and also predicts that the polymerase action changes the configuration of the microtubule end."

Other proteins that interact with the microtubules can help to speed up these construction and deconstruction processes. Ayaz et al. took a closer look at the structure of one particular family of proteins that make it easier for the microtubules to grow, using a technique called X-ray crystallography. The resulting images show two sites\u2014called TOG1 and TOG2\u2014on the enzymes that attach to the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin proteins. Ayaz et al. found that this binding can only occur when \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin has a curved shape, which only happens when the tubulins are not included in, or are only bound weakly to the end of, a microtubule."

Both TOG1 and TOG2 bind to \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin in the same way, and by using computer simulations Ayaz et al. found that this helps to speed up the growth of microtubules. This is because the enzyme's two sites concentrate the individual tubulin building blocks at the ends of the filament. For example, TOG2 could bind to the end of the microtubule, while TOG1 holds an \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin protein nearby and ready to bind to the filament's end. This tethering allows the microtubules to be assembled more efficiently."

Evolutionarily conserved proteins in the Stu2p/XMAP215 family (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gard and Kirschner, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ohkura et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wang and Huffaker, 1997</a>) regulate microtubule dynamics by promoting fast microtubule elongation.

This and other observations (e.g., <a href=\"#bib39\">Shirasu-Hiza et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">van Breugel et al., 2003</a>) formed the basis for describing XMAP215 as a catalyst for microtubule elongation. Catalytic action in turn led to the concept that TOG-containing polymerases might stabilize an otherwise rate-limiting intermediate along the polymerization pathway (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brouhard et al., 2008</a>). However, an understanding of mechanism has been limited because the nature of this intermediate, and how TOG domains might selectively promote it, remained unclear."

Our study also showed that a TOG1-TOG2 construct could bind two \u03b1\u03b2-tubulins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ayaz et al., 2012</a>). This latter observation suggested that two TOG domains might cooperate to stabilize an \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin interface, and consequently that cooperative binding to \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin might contribute to polymerase activity. Our study did not determine how the polymerase recognizes the extreme microtubule end, but we speculated based on apparent biochemical differences between the TOG1 and TOG2 domains (<a href=\"#bib2\">Al-Bassam et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Ayaz et al., 2012</a>) that selective interactions between TOG2 and a different, end-specific conformation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin might be important."

We first determined the crystal structure of a TOG2:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin complex. This structure reveals that TOG2 binds to the same curved conformation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin that TOG1 does. Our biochemical experiments underscore this structural similarity by demonstrating that the two TOG domains have comparable affinities for \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin, with K<sub>D</sub> \u223c100 nM. Next, we used analytical ultracentrifugation to show that in TOG1-TOG2 the two linked TOG domains bind non-cooperatively to two \u03b1\u03b2-tubulins. Non-cooperative binding indicates that TOG1-TOG2 does not stabilize an \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin interface. Together with biochemical and genetic experiments, our results lead to a model that explains how the polymerase activity can emerge from the action of two tethered TOG domains that each bind independently to a conformation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin that is incompatible with the microtubule lattice. We propose that the polymerase activity arises because linked TOG domains selectively increase the effective concentration of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin near weakly bound, curved \u03b1\u03b2-tubulins already on the microtubule end. A computational realization of this model supports our proposal by recapitulating catalyst-like behavior. The model further suggests that the polymerase achieves its effect in part by transiently altering the configuration of the growing end."

Conserved residues like W341 and R519 on the tubulin-binding surface of TOG2 make very similar contacts with \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin as their equivalents in TOG1 (W23 and R200, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The structure of TOG2 bound to \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin superimposes with the structure of \u2018free\u2019 TOG2 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Slep and Vale, 2007</a>) with 0.7 \u00c5 rmsd over 237 C\u03b1 atoms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Because the TOG2 domains pack differently in the \u2018bound\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019 crystals, the similarity in structure suggests that these TOG domains are rigid modules that do not change conformation when they bind \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. Even though the structure reported here was obtained from a new crystal form, the conformation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin in complex with TOG2 is nearly identical to that seen for TOG1-bound \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) (12.3\u00b0 of curvature in the TOG2 complex vs 13.1\u00b0 in the TOG1 complex), and is characteristically distinct from the straight conformation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin (1\u00b0 of curvature by our measure) (<a href=\"#bib25\">L\u00f6we et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Underscoring this similarity, individual tubulin chains between the TOG1 and TOG2 complexes superimpose on each other with 0.4 \u00c5 rmsd over C\u03b1 atoms. Thus, both TOG1 and TOG2 bind preferentially to the same, curved conformation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. By extension, other TOGs in this family probably also bind to curved \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin."

In contrast, other plus-end tracking proteins like Eb1 recognize lattice-specific features and consequently show \u2018comet-like\u2019 localization that extends into the microtubule body (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nakamura et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Maurer et al., 2014</a>).

Previously we had used polymerization-blocked \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin mutants (<a href=\"#bib21\">Johnson et al., 2011</a>) for TOG binding assays. To eliminate the possibility that blocking mutations and/or fluorescent labeling might mask or alter \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin interactions, we developed a label-free assay in which polymerization-competent \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin could be used. Analytical ultracentrifugation monitored by absorbance at 230 nm (A230) allowed us to work at concentrations of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin at which higher-order oligomers of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin were nearly undetectable (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Indeed, at \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 1 \u03bcM there is a single dominant peak at 5.8 S with only 1.7 and 2.8% of the material sedimenting faster at the lowest and highest concentration tested. This uniform sedimentation behavior made it possible for us to use analytical ultracentrifugation as a quantitative binding assay."

Red dots indicate the signal-weighted s<sub>w</sub> values for the seven runs. The blue and pink swaths show the predicted behavior for TOG1 and TOG2 binding \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin with 10-fold positive or negative cooperativity, respectively, and assuming the sedimentation coefficient of TOG1-TOG2:(\u03b1\u03b2)<sub>2</sub> falls in the range 9.1\u201310.9 S (see text).

First, using mutations on TOG1-TOG2 that disrupt the slightly weaker TOG2:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin interactions, we determined that TOG1-TOG2 bound to a single \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin sediments at 7.1 S (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Next, using a mixture in which \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin was superstoichiometric with respect to TOG1-TOG2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), we observed a larger species sedimenting at 9.1 S. This value places a lower limit on the sedimentation coefficient for the TOG1-TOG2:(\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin)<sub>2</sub> complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, inset) that is consistent with hydrodynamic calculations (<a href=\"#bib17\">Garc\u00eda De La Torre et al., 2000</a>) using extended models in which the two \u03b1\u03b2-tubulins do not contact each other and the TOG domains are separated by varying distances.

The resulting signal weighted average sedimentation coefficients are not consistent with models that assume even modest 10-fold positive or negative cooperativity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Instead, the data are much better described by a model in which each TOG domain in TOG1-TOG2 interacts independently with its \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin (the best fit was obtained from a model invoking less than twofold negative cooperativity, not shown). Noncooperative binding contradicts our initial expectation and indicates that \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin contacts do not provide additional stability to the TOG1-TOG2:(\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin)<sub>2</sub> complex."

Indeed, allowing 55 \u00c5 for the length of each TOG domain and assuming that the \u223c75 amino acid linker is flexible and can maximally span 220 \u00c5 we estimate that the two TOG1-TOG2-bound \u03b1\u03b2-tubulins are minimally at an effective concentration of roughly 200 \u03bcM, likely higher because the linker will rarely be fully extended. This effective concentration of TOG1-TOG2-bound \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin is in the range of current estimates for the longitudinal K<sub>D</sub> for \u03b1\u03b2-tubulins (e.g., <a href=\"#bib19\">Gardner et al., 2011</a>). Observing non-cooperative binding therefore suggests that some property of the TOG1-TOG2 linker antagonizes or counterbalances longitudinal interactions between \u03b1\u03b2-tubulins (see below for experiments concerning the linker sequence). Our data do not rule out that linked TOG domains might stabilize lateral interactions between \u03b1\u03b2-tubulins because these lateral interactions are thought to be much weaker (only molar affinity [<a href=\"#bib19\">Gardner et al., 2011</a>]): even at effective \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin concentrations approaching 1 mM a weak interface like this would not be populated and therefore would contribute little additional stability to the TOG1-TOG2:(\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin)<sub>2</sub> complex. Whatever the underlying mechanism, the unexpected observation that the two linked TOG domains behave as independent \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin binding modules places significant constraints on biochemical models for the mechanism of these polymerases."

Our model simulates microtubule polymerization one subunit association or dissociation at a time using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional lattice with staggered periodic boundary conditions to mimic the cylindrical structure of a 13 protofilament microtubule (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Because XMAP215 has been shown to promote the elongation of microtubules in the presence of a hydrolysis resistant GTP analog (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brouhard et al., 2008</a>), we performed \u2018GTP-only\u2019 simulations (no GTP hydrolysis) to simplify the behavior by eliminating catastrophe. We performed a manual grid search of longitudinal and corner interactions (in the model these interactions are the dominant contributors to growth rate) to identify parameters that reproduced experimentally observed microtubule growth rates. To validate our program, we first fit the same experimental data (<a href=\"#bib44\">Walker et al., 1988</a>) as did Odde and Cassimeris (<a href=\"#bib42\">VanBuren et al., 2002</a>), obtaining similar parameters (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This procedure identified a different set of parameters (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">VanBuren et al., 2002</a>).

To address the question \u2018can tethering give catalyst-like activity\u2019, we made a number of simplifying assumptions to create an implicit representation of polymerase action that isolates the \u2018tethered delivery\u2019 steps while ignoring other aspects of polymerase function and biochemistry. We assumed that every curved, longitudinally-bound \u2018singleton\u2019 \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin at the MT end is engaged by one TOG domain of a polymerase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, left panel). This assumption provides end-localized polymerase in the model without having to parameterize/describe its diffusive movement on the microtubule lattice (this movement is mediated by the basic domain, which is required for polymerase function), or if it arrives at the microtubule end with its TOGs pre-loaded with \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin (XMAP215 has been observed to carry \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin while diffusing on the lattice). To mimic the tethering-induced local increase in \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin concentration, in the model we accelerated the rate of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin association to the site neighboring the polymerase-bound singleton (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, arrow). We do not assume that the linker is directing the tethered subunit to a particular site\u2013separate simulations showed that accelerating the rate of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin association on top of the polymerase-bound singleton had no effect on growth rates (data not shown). We also assumed that when the polymerase bound singleton acquired a lateral neighbor it became straight (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rice et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buey et al., 2006</a>), and that this straightening was linked to TOG disengagement (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ayaz et al., 2012</a>)."

Varying the tethered association rate provides a way to mimic this \u2018saturation\u2019 effect without having to model it explicitly. Strikingly, the simulated microtubule elongation rates increase with the tethered \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin association rate while the apparent equilibrium constant for elongation (x-intercept) remains approximately constant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, middle; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

By preferentially recognizing curved \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin with one of its TOG domains, the polymerase (TOG domains in blue, basic region in red) can selectively localize to these \u2018unproductive\u2019 binding sites (second from left).

Our proposal is consistent with the view that curved, GTP-bound \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin is an on-pathway polymerization intermediate (e.g., <a href=\"#bib8\">Buey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Rice et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Nawrotek et al., 2011</a>). It also explains the need for at least two TOG domains (<a href=\"#bib47\">Widlund et al., 2011</a>) because one TOG is required to bind curved \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin on the microtubule and another linked TOG is required for tethering an unpolymerized \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. In this model, side-by-side trapping and the release of TOG domains will be linked because of the polymerization-associated conformational changes that occur in \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. The model provides a simple molecular explanation for the catalytic-like action of the polymerase, recapitulates the modest maximal stimulation, and rationalizes how a polymerase can be built from domains that bind preferentially to a microtubule-incompatible conformation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin."

Some plasmids (to express \u2018full-length\u2019 Stu2p and its R200 and R519 mutants) for the rescue assay were also previously described (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ayaz et al., 2012</a>). \u2018Dimerization-impaired\u2019 plasmids were constructed using mutagenesis primers to delete the region that codes for the coiled-coil dimerization element (corresponding to amino acids 658\u2013761). These primers contained two regions that were complementary to the coding sequences just upstream and downstream of the deleted region. \u2018Linker truncation\u2019 plasmids were constructed using a similar strategy to remove increasingly large sections from the middle of the sequence linking TOG1 to TOG2 (deleted regions are: \u039414:273-286; \u039422:277-298; \u039432:273-304; \u039440:257-296; \u039450:251-300; \u039460:251-310).

DNA coding for shuffled versions of the 65 central amino acids (residues 252\u2013316) of the TOG1-TOG2 linker was obtained from IDT and amplified using primers to append flanking nucleotides of wild-type upstream and downstream flanking sequence. The parent plasmid, excluding the region coding for the to-be-replaced linker sequence, was amplified in a separate reaction. The two products were mixed, incubated, and transformed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A similar strategy was used to replace TOG1 (residues 11\u2013245) with a second copy of TOG2 (residues 318\u2013560). The entire coding region of all plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing."

Occupied sites (excepting the seed) are considered available for dissociation, with the rate of dissociation given by k<sub>on</sub>*K<sub>D</sub> where K<sub>D</sub> is the affinity of interaction, which is determined by the neighbor state (number and type of lattice contacts) and obtained from longitudinal and corner affinities through thermodynamic coupling (<a href=\"#bib14\">Erickson and Pantaloni, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">VanBuren et al., 2002</a>). Simulations begin with only 13 possible events, each on an association onto the end of a protofilament. Possible events are stored in an indexed priority queue, sorted by their \u2018execution times\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gibson and Bruck, 2000</a>). Execution times are determined by first sampling a random number x between 0 and 1, and then calculating the time as \u2212(1/<i>rate</i>)*ln(x), where <i>rate</i> gives the appropriate first- or pseudo-first order rate constant. At each step the event with the shortest execution time is implemented, the simulation time is advanced accordingly, and the list of possible events and their associated rates is updated to account for changes in subunit neighbor state. To obtain the length (in \u03bcm) of a simulated microtubule at a given time, we divide the number of subunits by 1625, the number of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin subunits in 1 \u03bcm of microtubule."

This acceleration mimics a \u2018tethering\u2019 effect. Control experiments showed that accelerating the rate for adding on top of a longitudinally-associated singleton had negligible effect (not shown). To keep the model as simple as possible, we did not account for any potential stabilization of TOG-bound singletons at the microtubule end."

Further experiments show that tubulin binding to two linked domains is not cooperative. A series of experiments with \u201cdesigned\u201d Stu2 fragments then shows that any two TOGs on one molecule (either monomer or dimer) will give nearly normal catalytic activity. The authors find a minimum linker length for full activity of about 40 residues (consistent with the ca.300 TOG-TOG sequences in the database); the linker sequence is irrelevant. The manuscript then goes on to suggest a specific model for polymerization and to report results of simulations that embody the model. The notion is that one of the two required TOGs binds an \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin that has associated longitudinally with the end of a MT, rather than at a \u201ccorner\u201d, where the helical array creates lateral as well as longitudinal contacts. The former contact is, of course, weaker than the latter, but the model postulates that the high local concentration of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin created by the relatively weakly bound heterodimer on the second TOG domain (or presumably on any of the additional ones in a dimer or in a many-TOG monomer) promotes addition adjacent to the first heterodimer. Lateral contacts then enforce a straight conformation for both, releasing the catalyst and stabilizing the added pair as part of the growing end."

Assuming the same partial specific volume and solvent density, the sedimentation coefficient is proportional to M/f, where M is the molar mass and f is the frictional coefficient. To obtain significantly different sedimentation coefficients for the same mass requires large changes in f. For a back of the envelope calculation, the longitudinal and lateral complexes can be approximated as prolate ellipsoids with axial ratios of 2.1 and 1.43, respectively. These axial ratios lead to frictional ratios (assuming 0.3 g/g hydration) of 1.17 and 1.14. Thus, HYDROPRO calculated relatively similar values from the two configurations we considered because they have relatively similar frictional ratios and the same molar mass."
