To form the first axial vessels, angioblasts migrate towards the midline and coalesce underneath the notochord. Vascular endothelial growth factor has been proposed to serve as a chemoattractant for the angioblasts and to regulate this medial migration. Here we challenge this model and instead demonstrate that angioblasts rely on their intrinsic expression of Apelin receptors (Aplr, APJ) for their migration to the midline. We further show that during this angioblast migration Apelin receptor signaling is mainly triggered by the recently discovered ligand Elabela (Ela). As neither of the ligands Ela or Apelin (Apln) nor their receptors have previously been implicated in regulating angioblast migration, we hereby provide a novel mechanism for regulating vasculogenesis, with direct relevance to physiological and pathological angiogenesis."

To form the first axial vessels, angioblasts migrate towards the midline and coalesce underneath the notochord. Vascular endothelial growth factor has been proposed to serve as a chemoattractant for the angioblasts and to regulate this medial migration. Here we challenge this model and instead demonstrate that angioblasts rely on their intrinsic expression of Apelin receptors (Aplr, APJ) for their migration to the midline. We further show that during this angioblast migration Apelin receptor signaling is mainly triggered by the recently discovered ligand Elabela (Ela). As neither of the ligands Ela or Apelin (Apln) nor their receptors have previously been implicated in regulating angioblast migration, we hereby provide a novel mechanism for regulating vasculogenesis, with direct relevance to physiological and pathological angiogenesis."

In the embryos of animals with a backbone, blood flows from the heart through the aorta into branching smaller vessels to the cells.

The cells that make up these blood vessels develop from cells called angioblasts\u2014but first, during development these angioblasts must move to the place where the vessels will form."

However, in embryos where there is not enough Elabela, the Apelin hormone can compensate for this deficiency and the first blood vessels will later develop correctly. Future research will address whether this signaling pathway not only guides angioblasts to establish a circulatory system, but also guides blood vessel growth. As blood vessel growth is very relevant to human disease, identifying the mechanisms that regulate it will have an impact on biomedical research."

In <i>Xenopus</i> embryos, transcripts for the <i>vegfa</i> gene are expressed in the midline and migrating angioblasts were guided towards sites of ectopic Vegfa expression (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cleaver and Krieg, 1998</a>). Global inactivation of the genes encoding VEGF-A or the corresponding receptor VEGFR2 in mice led to strong vascular defects affecting the whole vascular network including the DA (<a href=\"#bib29\">Shalaby et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Ferrara et al., 1996</a>). Based on these data it was concluded that in vertebrates VEGF-A signaling regulates angioblast migration to the midline (<a href=\"#bib6\">Coultas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Verma et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Gore et al., 2012</a>).

To analyze whether Vegfa signaling, as previously proposed, is required for angioblast migration to the midline, we analyzed loss-of-function zebrafish embryos with deficiencies in the Vegfa signaling pathway resulting from genomic mutations as well as morpholino (MO) -mediated knockdown. To rule out developmental delays, we counted the somites of the embryos and fixed them for confocal analysis, when they had developed 16\u201317 somites (equivalent to 17 hpf). Surprisingly, neither Vegfa ligand depletion (<i>vegfaa/vegfab</i> MO) nor a null mutation in the gene encoding the VEGFR2 ortholog (<i>kdrl</i>) interfered with angioblast migration in zebrafish embryos (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H,J</a>), although Vegfa signaling dependent phenotypes, like failure to form the intersegmental vessels, could be observed after 24 hpf (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of Vegfr2 signaling from 6 to 17 hpf did not impair angioblast migration to the midline (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As activity of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in the midline has been shown to induce <i>vegfaa</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lawson et al., 2002</a>), we repeated the published experiments and blocked this process by chemical inhibition of Shh signaling using cyclopamine. In line with our previous experiments, angioblast migration was not affected after Shh inhibition (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The sum of these data strongly indicates that Vegfa signaling is dispensable for angioblast specification or migration in zebrafish."

At the same time, transcripts of its two paralogous receptors <i>apelin receptor a</i> (<i>aplnra</i>) and <i>apelin receptor b</i> (<i>aplnrb</i>) were present in angioblasts (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>; [<a href=\"#bib28\">Scott et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Zeng et al., 2007</a>]). Using MO-mediated gene knockdown, we observed that both <i>aplnra</i> and <i>aplnrb</i> are important for midline migration of angioblasts. While absence of each individual receptor reduced the efficiency of migration towards the midline, double depletion completely abolished this process (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). We used TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hwang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Jao et al., 2013</a>) to introduce mutations in either the <i>aplnra</i> or the <i>aplnrb</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As our MO-based analysis already indicated an additive effect of both receptor genes, we analyzed the phenotypes of the offspring of <i>aplnra</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup><i>;aplnrb</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> double heterozygous parents. The embryos were all individually scored for their phenotype regarding angioblast midline migration into four categories (normal, mild, strong, stronger; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and then subjected to genotyping. Homozygous mutant embryos phenocopied the MO-induced phenotypes, additional loss of one or two copies of the second receptor increased the severity of the phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Additionally, we detected <i>aplnrb</i> transcripts together with the angioblast specification marker <i>etv2</i> indicating that both genes are expressed very early during angioblast specification. However, when we analyzed <i>aplnra/aplnrb</i> double deficient embryos, no difference in <i>etv2</i> expression was detectable by in situ hybridization indicating that Apln receptors only regulate angioblast migration, but not specification (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>)."

Recently, it was published that Ela does not act as a chemoattractant, but instead acts as a motogen in regulating mesoderm migration during gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pauli et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, the <i>aplnr</i> deficient (<i>aplra/b</i> MO injected) angioblasts were still partially motile and did send out filopodia, but failed to migrate to the midline (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). To test whether Ela does act as a chemoattractant or just enables motility of angioblasts, we overexpressed Ela at ectopic locations in <i>noto</i> or <i>ta</i> mutant embryos, as both of these lack endogenous <i>ela</i> and <i>apln</i> expression in the NC. We used a heatshock promoter to control timing of expression and labeled Ela overexpressing cells by coexpression of RFP through an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We measured the distance of control (Cherry) or Ela/RFP expressing cells from angioblasts in a 40 \u03bcm radius of the red labeled cell and considered an angioblast as attracted, if it was less than 5 \u03bcm away from it. While only 20% of the angioblast were found in the vicinity of control cells, more than 52% of the angioblasts were close to Ela overexpressing cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,G</a>). Together with the observed dose dependency of Ela-Apln, the motility of Aplnr deficient embryos and the rescue of NC mutants by midline Ela expression, our data support the interpretation, that Ela acts as a chemoattractant for angioblasts during midline migration."

Transplanted angioblasts were identified by transgenic EGFP expression together with mini-Ruby stain. By counting the number of EGFP positive donor angioblasts in the midline vs all EGFP positive donor angioblasts (100%), the percentage of donor angioblasts in the midline was determined for each individual embryo."

Previous studies implicated Vascular endothelial growth factor in convergence of angioblasts towards the embryonic midline, where they coalesce to build the first embryonic vessels. The authors first present evidence from zebrafish against the requirement for Vegf in angioblast migration towards the midline. Rather, they proposed, Apelin and Elabela, have partially redundant function to guide angioblasts to the midline by acting through the Apelin receptors. Apelin, Apelin GPCR Receptor axis has been previously implicated in cardiac progenitor cell convergence and cell fate specification, by Scott et al., and Zeng et al., in 2007. Elabela acting through Apelin receptors has been shown to be required for gastrulation cell movements and both heart and endoderm development by <a href=\"#bib4\">Chng et al., 2013</a> and <a href=\"#bib26\">Pauli et al., 2014</a>. However, neither Apelin nor Elabela have been proposed to affect gastrulation cell movements acting as guidance molecules, with Elabela being considered a motogen. The authors employ morpholino oligonucleotides and mutations to show that Apelin and Elabela expressed in the notochord have partially redundant function in angioblast migration. Moreover, <i>apelin</i> receptors <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> expressed in angioblasts also have redundant function in this process. Therefore the proposed role of Apelin/Elabela/Apelin receptor signaling to guide angioblasts towards the embryonic midline would be a significant advance. However, the evidence in support of these conclusions are not compelling. There are also problems with the results and their interpretations. These problems should be addressed before the manuscript becomes suitable for publication."

Previous studies implicated Vascular endothelial growth factor in convergence of angioblasts towards the embryonic midline, where they coalesce to build the first embryonic vessels. The authors first present evidence from zebrafish against the requirement for Vegf in angioblast migration towards the midline. Rather, they proposed, Apelin and Elabela, have partially redundant function to guide angioblasts to the midline by acting through the Apelin receptors. Apelin, Apelin GPCR Receptor axis has been previously implicated in cardiac progenitor cell convergence and cell fate specification, by Scott et al., and Zeng et al., in 2007. Elabela acting through Apelin receptors has been shown to be required for gastrulation cell movements and both heart and endoderm development by</i> <a href=\"#bib4\"><i>Chng et al., 2013</i></a> <i>and</i> <a href=\"#bib26\"><i>Pauli et al., 2014</i></a><i>. However, neither Apelin nor Elabela have been proposed to affect gastrulation cell movements acting as guidance molecules, with Elabela being considered a motogen. The authors employ morpholino oligonucleotides and mutations to show that Apelin and Elabela expressed in the notochord have partially redundant function in angioblast migration. Moreover,</i> apelin receptors a <i>and</i> b <i>expressed in angioblasts also have redundant function in this process. Therefore the proposed role of Apelin/Elabela/Apelin receptor signaling to guide angioblasts towards the embryonic midline would be a significant advance. However, the evidence in support of these conclusions are not compelling. There are also problems with the results and their interpretations.
