It is unclear how the low abundant Ire1\u03b1 efficiently finds and cleaves the majority of mRNAs at the ER membrane. Here, we reveal that Ire1\u03b1 forms a complex with the Sec61 translocon to cleave its mRNA substrates. We show that Ire1\u03b1's key substrate, <i>XBP1u</i> mRNA, is recruited to the Ire1\u03b1-Sec61 translocon complex through its nascent chain, which contains a pseudo-transmembrane domain to utilize the signal recognition particle (SRP)-mediated pathway. Depletion of SRP, the SRP receptor or the Sec61 translocon in cells leads to reduced Ire1\u03b1-mediated splicing of XBP1u mRNA. Furthermore, mutations in Ire1\u03b1 that disrupt the Ire1\u03b1-Sec61 complex causes reduced Ire1\u03b1-mediated cleavage of ER-targeted mRNAs. Thus, our data suggest that the UPR is coupled with the co-translational protein translocation pathway to maintain protein homeostasis in the ER during stress conditions."
