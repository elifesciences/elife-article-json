Critical to this process is the effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) that produces second messenger cAMP upon receptor-mediated activation by G protein Golf. However, the molecular organization of the G<sub>olf-</sub>AC5 signaling axis is not well understood. In this study, we report that in the striatum AC5 exists in a stable pre-coupled complex with subunits of G<sub>olf</sub> heterotrimer. We use genetic mouse models with disruption in individual components of the complex to reveal hierarchical order of interactions required for AC5-G<sub>olf</sub> stability. We further identify that the assembly of AC5-G<sub>olf</sub> complex is mediated by PhLP1 chaperone that plays central role in neurotransmitter receptor coupling to cAMP production motor learning. These findings provide evidence for the existence of stable G protein-effector signaling complexes and identify a new component essential for their assembly."

Critical to this process is the effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) that produces second messenger cAMP upon receptor-mediated activation by G protein Golf. However, the molecular organization of the G<sub>olf-</sub>AC5 signaling axis is not well understood. In this study, we report that in the striatum AC5 exists in a stable pre-coupled complex with subunits of G<sub>olf</sub> heterotrimer. We use genetic mouse models with disruption in individual components of the complex to reveal hierarchical order of interactions required for AC5-G<sub>olf</sub> stability. We further identify that the assembly of AC5-G<sub>olf</sub> complex is mediated by PhLP1 chaperone that plays central role in neurotransmitter receptor coupling to cAMP production motor learning. These findings provide evidence for the existence of stable G protein-effector signaling complexes and identify a new component essential for their assembly."

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form the largest group of the receptors responsible for the actions of the majority of neurotransmitters and play a critical role in virtually all neuronal functions (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gainetdinov et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wettschureck and Offermanns, 2005</a>). In a classical model, upon binding to neurotransmitter, GPCRs undergo conformational changes activating heterotrimeric G proteins by promoting GTP binding to G\u03b1 subunits and triggering the release of the G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits. When dissociated, both G\u03b1 and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits modulate the activities of downstream effector molecules that are directly responsible for generating cellular responses (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gilman, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Neer, 1995</a>). However, an emerging alternative model suggests that G protein heterotrimers exist in more stable complexes that rearrange rather than dissociate upon activation and may further form higher order signaling complexes with receptors and effectors (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bunemann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dupre et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hepler, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lambert, 2008</a>). The assembly of this macromolecular complex may be tightly regulated. Indeed, several chaperone proteins have been described to be required for the biogenesis of the G protein subunits and their complexes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dupre et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Papasergi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Willardson and Tracy, 2012</a>)."

Numerous isoforms of AC are differentially modulated by both G\u03b2\u03b3 and various G\u03b1-GTP subunits and play critical roles in a variety of fundamental neuronal processes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sadana and Dessauer, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sunahara et al., 1996</a>). GPCR signaling to AC performs a particularly important function in the striatum, the input structure of the basal ganglia circuit essential for initiating and maintaining movement, mood control, and reward valuation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Graybiel, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</a>). Imbalance in cAMP homeostasis in this region has been associated with drug addiction, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and a variety of movement disorders (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bonito-Oliva et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Girault, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nestler and Aghajanian, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wilson and Brandon, 2015</a>). Striatal neurons receive diverse inputs that converge on AC5, the major AC isoform in the region, accounting for ~ 80% of cAMP generation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2002</a>). Coupling of key neurotransmitter receptors, such as dopamine D1 (D1R) and adenosine A2A (A2AR) to increase cAMP production in these neurons, is mediated to a large extent by a unique heterotrimer composed of the stimulatory \u03b1 subunit G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub> complexed with G\u03b2<sub>2</sub> and G\u03b3<sub>7</sub> subunits (<a href=\"#bib26\">Herve, 2011</a>). Indeed, deletion of G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>, G\u03b3<sub>7</sub> or AC5 in mice severely diminishes cAMP production in response to D1R and A2AR activation, which is paralleled by muted behavioral responses to psychostimulants and antipsychotics that act on these receptors as well as by profound motor deficits (<a href=\"#bib11\">Corvol et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Iwamoto et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sasaki et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Schwindinger et al., 2010</a>). Recently, mutations in G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub> and AC5 have been shown to cause primary dystonia in humans (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carapito et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fuchs et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kumar et al., 2014</a>), further supporting the key contribution of G<sub>olf-</sub>AC5 signaling axis to pathophysiology of movement disorders. These observations argue for the lack of functional compensation from other AC isoforms and heterotrimeric G proteins in transducing the signal. However, the functional significance of striatal-specific composition of these specific signaling elements is not well understood."

AC5 displays dual regulation by G protein subunits in which G\u03b2\u03b3 acts to facilitate its activation by G\u03b1<sub>s</sub> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gao et al., 2007</a>). In vitro biochemical studies show that AC5 is capable of binding G\u03b1<sub>s</sub> and G\u03b2\u03b3 simultaneously, suggesting that it can scaffold the stimulatory G protein heterotrimers (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sadana et al., 2009</a>).

                                "text": "To begin testing the idea that AC5 may exist in a stable complex with the Golf heterotrimer in vivo, we first analyzed their binding by co-immunoprecipitaiton assays. AC5 was effectively and specifically pulled down together with both G\u03b1olf and, to a lesser extent, G\u03b2<sub>2</sub> from mouse striatal lysates, indicating that in striatal neurons Golf subunits form stable complexes with AC5 in their ground state in the absence of receptor stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Next, we analyzed the relationship between AC5 and Golf by examining the co-dependence of their expression using mouse knockout models. Elimination of AC5 in mice (<i>Adcy5</i><sup>-/-</sup>) dramatically reduced the expression of G\u03b1olf but had no appreciable effect on G\u03b22 expression, suggesting that AC5 contributes to the stability of G\u03b1olf but not the stability of the G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We further used <i>Adcy5</i><sup>-/-</sup> striatal tissues in the immunoprecipitation experiments and found that antibodies against AC5 failed to pull-down G<sub>olf</sub> subunits from striatal lysates lacking AC5, confirming the specificity of G<sub>olf</sub> association with AC5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In contrast, disruption of G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> by eliminating G\u03b3<sub>7</sub> in <i>Gng7</i><sup>-/-</sup> knockout led to a marked down-regulation of both AC5 and G\u03b1olf expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The consequences of G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub> disruption were evaluated in heterozygous mice (<i>Gnal</i><sup>+/-</sup>) with severely diminished G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub> expression because complete ablation of G\u03b1olf leads to increased perinatal lethality (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belluscio et al., 1998</a>). In these animals, the levels of both AC5 and G\u03b2<sub>2</sub> were substantially reduced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Therefore, in mouse striatum co-dependence of the complex components appears to be unidirectional: destabilization of either the G\u03b1 or G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits of the Golf heterotrimer compromised AC5 stability, while only G\u03b1 but not G\u03b2\u03b3 was affected by the loss of AC5."

In HEK293 cells, co-transfection with PhLP1 significantly increased the expression of all three G<sub>olf</sub> subunits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In contrast, a dominant negative construct of PhLP1 (\u0394NT-PhLP1), lacking the first 75 amino acids critical for its interaction with G\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lukov et al., 2005</a>) had no effect on the expression G<sub>olf</sub> subunits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Consistent with the described impact of PhLP1 on G\u03b2\u03b3 complexes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lukov et al., 2005</a>), co-expression with full-length PhLP1 resulted in a significant increase in the formation of the G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> complexes as evidenced by the fluorescence complementation assay with the split-Venus system (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast, \u0394NT-PhLP1 exerted the opposite effect and inhibited G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> assembly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To examine the functional effects of PhLP1 in a context of the entire Golf heterotrimer, we tested the ability of G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> and G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub> subunits to undergo a cycle of dissociation/re-association in response to changes in the D1R activity. We used a cell-based Bioluminescence Energy Transfer (BRET) assay to monitor the release of the G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> dimer in the presence of G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In this assay, stimulation of D1R by dopamine results in the activation of G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>, releasing Venus-tagged G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> to interact with the NanoLuc-tagged reporter, an event detected by changes in the BRET signal. Conversely, application of an antagonist SCH39166 facilitates complex re-association and quenching of the BRET response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Reversing the sequence of ligand addition abolishes the response indicating that changes in the BRET signal are associated with the activation of the D1R receptors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Furthermore, omitting D1R or G<sub>olf</sub> from the transfection also dramatically suppressed the signal indicating that the signal is specifically driven by the D1R-mediated activation of the G<sub>olf</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Using this assay we found that PhLP1 coexpression significantly increased dopamine-induced activation of G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>-G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> heterotrimer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). In contrast, expression of the dominant negative \u0394NT-PhLP1 significantly attenuated the BRET response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). These observations suggest that PhLP1 facilitates functional coupling of G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> to D1 receptors, likely owning to its ability to promote the assembly of G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> complexes."

We tested this possibility by measuring the effect of PhLP1 co-expression on AC5 expression. PhLP1 co-expression resulted in a significant increase (~1.7 fold) in AC5 expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This effect was paralleled by elevation of the basal cAMP levels (~4 fold) in the cells expressing AC5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In addition, AC5-containing cells showed enhanced cAMP generation in response to both the direct AC activator forskolin (~4 fold increase) and the \u03b22-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (~1.5 fold increase) when PhLP1 was overexpressed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These effects were AC5-dependent as no stimulatory effect on cAMP generation was observed in the absence of AC5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Interestingly, while the increase in GPCR-driven cAMP production (likely through G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>) in the presence of PhLP1 closely matched the increase in the total AC5 levels, the effect of PhLP1 on both basal and forskolin-induced cAMP production was much larger. These observations suggest that PhLP1 may exert functional effects on cAMP production that are independent from increasing AC expression."

Remarkably, purified recombinant full-length PhLP1 significantly enhanced basal AC activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This effect was not observed with \u0394NT-PhLP1, suggesting that the effect likely involves an ability of PhLP1 to bind G\u03b2\u03b3. The reaction buffer in these assays did not contain GTP, therefore the effect of PhLP1 was unlikely to result from the classical activation of G\u03b1. Given that in the striatal membranes AC5 forms a complex with G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub>\u00a0we hypothesized that PhLP1 may cause activation by scavenging G\u03b2\u03b3 and releasing G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>, making it available for the activation of AC5, as even GDP-bound free G\u03b1 subunits are capable of regulating AC (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sunahara et al., 1997</a>). To test this notion, we compared the ability of forskolin and G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>-GTP to regulate AC activity in the striatal membranes in the absence or presence of PhLP1. G\u03b1<sub>s</sub> is known to synergize with forskolin increasing its ability to regulate cyclase activity by promoting binding of forskolin to a high affinity site (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dessauer et al., 1997</a>). Consistent with our model, PhLP1 significantly enhanced forskolin-stimulated AC activity in striatal membranes and produced an approximately three-fold reduction in EC<sub>50</sub> for forskolin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a>). In contrast, PhLP1 failed to exert an effect on AC activated by adding exogenous G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>-GTP\u03b3S (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and G</a>) supporting the idea that PhLP1 activates AC5 through a G\u03b1-dependent mechanism. In this case, added G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>-GTP\u03b3S likely out competed endogenous G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>-GDP activating AC5 after being released by PhLP1. Thus, PhLP1 appears to regulate AC5 activity by a dual mechanism. On the one hand it enhances the expression of the AC5 by facilitating its complex formation with G<sub>olf</sub>. On the other, it may act in promoting the receptor-independent release of G\u03b1olf that stimulates AC5 activity."

In agreement with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib63\">Schroder and Lohse, 2000</a>), we found PhLP1 protein to be abundantly expressed in the mouse striatum by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To study the role of PhLP1 in the striatum, we ablated its expression selectively in the striatum by crossing the conditional PhLP1 mouse strain (<i>Pdcl<sup>flx/flx</sup></i>) with the striatal driver mouse line <i>Rgs9-Cre</i>, generating a conditional, striatal-specific elimination of PhLP1 (<i>Pdcl</i> cKO) mouse (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In this line recombination likely occurs postnatally, as expression of the <i>Rgs9</i> gene is induced around P3 to P6 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2007</a>). We began our analysis by assessing possible anatomical changes because previous studies indicated that elimination of PhLP1 may lead to neuronal degeneration (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lai et al., 2013</a>). Overall, striatal morphology of <i>Pdcl</i> cKO mice looked normal with no signs of degeneration at least until 3\u20134 months of age (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Morphometric analysis revealed a decrease in the total volume of striatal tissue in <i>Pdcl</i> cKO mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Counting the number of neurons (diameter &gt; 5 \u03bcm) in the striatum tissue using Nissl staining revealed a significantly greater number of neurons in the <i>Pdcl</i> cKO mice. A greater number of cells together with a smaller volume that they occupy indicate that the sizes of individual striatal neurons are likely smaller. These changes are consistent with retarded maturation of neurons, a process controlled by the cAMP signaling (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fujioka et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nakagawa et al., 2002</a>). We next analyzed projections of striatal medium spiny neurons to the target regions Globus Pallidus (GPe) and Substantia Nigra (SNr), revealed by immunostaining for enkephalin and substance P, respectively. Quantification of fluorescence intensity revealed no difference in the intensities of the signals for these markers, which were found in appropriate target areas (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In summary, these data indicate that loss of PhLP1 in the striatum does not lead to neuronal degeneration, but rather promotes neuronal survival while inhibiting their growth."

Previous in vivo studies also demonstrated that PhLP1 is required for the assembly of G\u03b2<sub>1</sub> with G\u03b1t<sub>1</sub> and G\u03b2<sub>3</sub> with G\u03b1<sub>t2</sub> as well as G\u03b2<sub>5</sub> complexes with RGS9-1 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lai et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib70\">Tracy et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, we proceeded to investigate the consequences of PhLP1 ablation on the expression of various subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, RGS proteins and AC5 in the striatum (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Immunoblotting shows that the levels of PhLP1 protein were reduced by ~60% in <i>Pdcl</i> cKO striatum. Consistent with the results in transfected cells, we found that the levels of G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>, G\u03b2<sub>2</sub> and AC5 were severely reduced in <i>Pdcl</i> cKO as well. Deletion of PhLP1 also had a detrimental effect on the expression of G\u03b2<sub>5</sub> and RGS9-2, as may have been expected from the studies on the rod and cone photoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lai et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tracy et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, the effect was clearly selective as deletion of PhLP1 did not affect the expression of G\u03b2<sub>1</sub> and G\u03b1 subunits possibly associated with it: G\u03b1<sub>o</sub>, G\u03b1<sub>i</sub>, G\u03b1<sub>q</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Furthermore, the levels of another G\u03b2<sub>5</sub> associated protein, RGS7 were also unaffected. Analysis of the mRNA levels for corresponding down-regulated proteins showed no changes in the transcript levels, suggesting that PhLP1 likely contributes to protein stability rather than affects the expression through a transcriptional mechanism (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Therefore, it appears that PhLP1 selectively affects biosynthesis and/or assembly of the AC5 signaling complex that in addition to G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub>\u00a0also contains RGS9-2/G\u03b2<sub>5</sub> (<a href=\"#bib75\">Xie et al., 2012</a>)."

We find that this interaction occurs at the basal state and can be detected without agonist application, which is typically required to promote dissociation of heterotrimers into G\u03b1-GTP and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits making them competent for binding to effectors. We further demonstrate that binding to G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> complex is required for the proteolytic stabilization of AC5 that results in its high expression level in the striatum. In the course of this study, we further confirmed previously reported interdependence among subunits of the G<sub>olf</sub> heterotrimer in which interactions between G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub> and G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> are required for mutual proteolytic stabilization of the complex (<a href=\"#bib30\">Iwamoto et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Schwindinger et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Schwindinger et al., 2010</a>).

While there are several examples for the association of both G\u03b1 and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits with effector molecule, e.g. PLC\u03b2, GIRK channels, AC isoforms (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kovoor and Lester, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lyon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sunahara et al., 1996</a>), to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to document a case in which stable association with all subunits of G protein heterotrimer is required for the stability of an effector. Taken together with biochemical studies showing that AC5 is capable of scaffolding inactive G protein heterotrimers (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sadana et al., 2009</a>), our results suggest that in striatal neurons heterotrimeric G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 is assembled in a pre-coupled \u2018signalosome\u2019 in which subunits rearrange rather than physically dissociate upon GPCR activation."

                                "text": "We report that the chaperone protein PhLP1 plays a critical role in the assembly of the Golf-AC5 complex in striatal neurons. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of PhLP1 in the assembly of the complexes involving G\u03b2 subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. It is thought to function as a co-chaperone with the cytosolic chaperonin complex (CCT), assisting in retrieval of the G\u03b2 subunits emerging from the CCT and presenting them for the association with the Gg subunits (<a href=\"#bib73\">Willardson and Tracy, 2012</a>). In addition to assisting folding of conventional G\u03b2\u03b3 complexes, PhLP1 chaperones the formation of the structurally similar complexes involving the atypical G\u03b2<sub>5</sub> subunits and the G\u03b3-like domains in RGS proteins (<a href=\"#bib28\">Howlett et al., 2009</a>). Consistent with this model, deletion of PhLP1 in photoreceptors disrupts the formation of G\u03b2<sub>1</sub>\u03b3<sub>1</sub> (in rods), G\u03b2<sub>3</sub>\u03b3<sub>8</sub> (in cones) and G\u03b2<sub>5L</sub>/RGS9-1 complexes (in both rods and cones), dramatically decreasing their expression (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lai et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tracy et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of PhLP1 deficient in G\u03b2 binding in rods down-regulates the expression of the G\u03b2<sub>1</sub>\u03b3<sub>1</sub> and G\u03b2<sub>5L</sub>/RGS9-1 complexes (<a href=\"#bib55\">Posokhova et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, loss of PhLP1 function also results in a dramatic decrease in the expression of G\u03b1<sub>t1</sub> and G\u03b1<sub>t2</sub> subunits in rods and cones, respectively (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lai et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tracy et al., 2015</a>). Given that stability of these G\u03b1 subunits depends on their complex formation with Gbg (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kolesnikov et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lobanova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nikonov et al., 2013</a>), the role of PhLP1 in stabilizing G\u03b1<sub>t1</sub> and G\u03b1<sub>t2</sub> is likely indirect and stems from its effects on G\u03b2\u03b3 complex assembly."

                                "text": "Similar to the situation in photoreceptors, we observe that knockout of PhLP1 in striatal neurons results in marked down-regulation in the expression of all subunits of heterotrimeric G<sub>olf</sub> complex. Direct side-by-side comparison of the impact on protein expression produced by elimination of individual subunits of the G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 complex affords a unique opportunity to analyze the reciprocal relationship between complex components. Our results suggest a hierarchical relationship in the assembly of the complex. The stability of G\u03b1olf requires its association with both G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> and AC5, but the stability of G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> depends only on the association with G\u03b1olf and not AC5. In turn, stability of AC5 is dependent on both G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> and G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>. Given that PhLP1 directly binds to Gbg subunits (<a href=\"#bib62\">Savage et al., 2000b</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Thibault et al., 1997</a>) and has been shown to be required for folding G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> in transfected cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Howlett et al., 2009</a>), we propose the following model for the role in PhLP1 the assembly of the G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 complex. PhLP1 assists the assembly of the G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> complex, increasing its expression, which in turn upregulates G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>. Higher levels of G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> promote stabilization of the AC5 by forming pre-coupled complexes with it. Thus, PhLP1 triggers a chain of events resulting in the stabilization of the entire AC5-G<sub>olf</sub> complex ensuring its high expression level and setting the stoichiometry (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

                                "text": "It is interesting that PhLP1 loss in striatal neurons affected G protein complexes in a selective fashion. Studies in transfected cells indicate that PhLP1 participates in folding and stabilization of virtually all G\u03b2\u03b3 combinations including complexes of G\u03b2<sub>5</sub> with RGS9 and RGS7 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Howlett et al., 2009</a>). Yet, we find that in the striatum, PhLP1 elimination has no effect on the expression of many G protein subunits, including G\u03b2<sub>1</sub>, a subunit clearly impacted by PhLP1 loss in rod photoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lai et al., 2013</a>). We propose that this apparent selectivity may be explained by higher susceptibility of G proteins with high expression levels to the destabilizing effects associated with PhLP1 loss than those expressed at moderate to low levels. In this scenario, PhLP1 action may be the rate-limiting factor required for achieving high expression of G proteins with abundant mRNA expression in a particular neuronal population, e.g. G\u03b1<sub>t1</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>\u03b3<sub>1</sub>, G\u03b1<sub>t2</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub>\u03b3<sub>8</sub> and G\u03b1olf\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> overexpressed in rods, cones and striatal neurons, respectively. However, at this point, we also cannot rule out an alternative explanation that cellular heterogeneity in the striatum contributes to selectivity of the effects. Although <i>Rgs9-Cre</i> driver line that we used to delete PhLP1 is active in 95% of neurons in the striatum, it might have no effect on other cells such as glia that might contain a higher abundance of G protein subunits that we find to be unregulated by PhLP1."

                                "text": "It is interesting to consider the results of this study in light of the mechanisms linking GPCR signaling in striatal neurons to cAMP production and behavior. The G<sub>olf</sub> heterotrimer is known to be essential for coupling both D1 and A2A receptors in direct and indirect striatal neurons to stimulation of cAMP production (<a href=\"#bib26\">Herve, 2011</a>). Knockout of <i>Gnal</i> or <i>Gng7</i> that encode G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub> or G\u03b3<sub>7</sub> respectively, markedly reduces the ability of D1R and A2AR agonists to increase cAMP, and this biochemical observation is paralleled by muted behavioral responses of mice to psychostimulants that activate these receptors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Corvol et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Schwindinger et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zhuang et al., 2000</a>). Acute psychomotor responses to drugs appear to be particularly sensitive to loss of G<sub>olf</sub>, while adaptive behaviors to repeated drug exposure are preserved (<a href=\"#bib11\">Corvol et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Schwindinger et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, levels of G<sub>olf</sub> complex dictate particular signaling outcomes upon receptor stimulation. For example, while G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub> is critical for the ability of D1R to stimulate both cAMP production and ERK phosphorylation, G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub> haploinsufficiency leads to selective deficits in cAMP signaling without detrimentally affecting coupling to ERK (<a href=\"#bib11\">Corvol et al., 2007</a>). This signaling dichotomy becomes even more pronounced at the level of AC5. Although, activation of either D1R and A2A clearly results in the increase in cAMP levels (<a href=\"#bib10\">Corvol et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Iwamoto et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2002</a>) and AC5 mediates nearly 80% of this effect (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2002</a>), elimination of AC5 in mice does not diminish behavioral responses of mice to the administration of A1R and D1R agonists (<a href=\"#bib29\">Iwamoto et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2002</a>). At the same time, mice lacking AC5 have abolished responses to D2 antagonists, suggesting greater impact of signaling via AC5 in indirect pathway neurons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2002</a>). Balance of neurotransmitter signaling between direct and indirect pathway striatal neurons is thought to set a tightly orchestrated coordination of movements (<a href=\"#bib24\">Graybiel, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014</a>). In agreement with this idea, mice lacking AC5 or G\u03b3<sub>7</sub> show profound deficits in motor learning and coordination (<a href=\"#bib29\">Iwamoto et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kheirbek et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sasaki et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, mutations in genes encoding AC5 and G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub> in humans cause dystonia, a disorder characterized by involuntary movements (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carapito et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fuchs et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kumar et al., 2014</a>). Thus, it is likely that G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 axis is involved in more subtle coordination of signaling in striatal neurons that sometimes might not be evident from measuring gross motor responses to pharmacological treatment with receptor ligands."

Our <i>Pdcl</i> cKO model displays complete lack of motor learning, deficits in psychostimulatory effects of A2AR antagonism and diminished neuroleptic responses to D2R antagonism. As with studies on <i>Adcy5-/-</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib26\">Herve, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2002</a>), perhaps the most surprising result of our studies is the intact responses of mice lacking PhLP1 to D1R agonism. This observation is particularly striking given the profound down-regulation of AC5, G\u03b1<sub>olf</sub> and G\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b3<sub>7</sub> in these mice paralleled by equal deficits in coupling of both D1R and A2AR to cAMP production. We think that this selectivity is likely related to downregulation of all signaling components rather than their complete loss. It is possible that striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons have differential sensitivity to changes in the efficiency of the G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 coupling, creating signaling imbalance when the expression of signaling components is diminished. This effect could be either exacerbated or compensated by the loss of RGS9-2 that also controls AC5 activity (<a href=\"#bib75\">Xie et al., 2012</a>) and signaling downstream from D2 receptors (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cabrera-Vera et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Celver et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rahman et al., 2003</a>), further contributing to signaling imbalance. Alternatively, preservation of D1R mediated behavioral responses in <i>Pdcl</i> cKO mice may also indicate that signaling pathways other than cAMP initiated by D1 receptors (<a href=\"#bib52\">Nishi et al., 2011</a>) play compensatory role. In any event, our study demonstrates the importance of proper Golf-AC5 complex expression and assembly for the balance of the neurotransmitter signaling in striatal neurons and introduces PhLP1 as a critical regulator of the process and an interesting molecular player to consider in the pathology of dystonia and possibly other movement disorders."

On the more critical side, I personally like the larger signalosome idea but am not convinced of it from the data shown. As far as I can tell, all of the effects observed in the PhLP1 KO are consistent with changes in overall protein abundance from co-chaperone actions of PhLP1 in beta-gamma and beta-RGS9 complex formation. The effect on AC5 abundance might indicate that it is included in the complex but might also occur secondarily through changes in Golf subunit abundance. I also think that the signaling data seem consistent with effects of protein abundance changes rather than as evidence that signaling must occur from the larger complex. The knockout mouse is very interesting but there, also, I think that the effects might be explained in a simpler way. The behavioral deficits are interesting but quite complicated to interpret, due to the cytological defects noted."

One can even get tricked by pre-immune serum from the same animal due to inflammation (acute phase effect). Here the investigators have an AC5 KO mouse. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> there should be a variant of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> co-IP with AC5<sup>\u2013/\u2013</sup> striatum.

However, haloperidol is a D2 and not D1 antagonist, and D1 but not D2 receptors couple to Golf. Of course 100 \u03bcM is a huge concentration of haloperidol, but so is 10 \u03bcM of dopamine.

Based on accumulated data, we think PhLP1 affects AC5 activity by a dual mechanism. On the one hand, it upregulates AC5 activity and this effect is likely responsible for the corresponding increase in receptor stimulated cAMP production (compare ~1.7 fold expression upregulation in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> to ~ 1.5 fold of ISO driven cAMP production in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, the changes in basal or FSK-induced cAMP production (~4-fold) are much greater than the change in the AC5 expression level. This suggests the involvement of other mechanisms by which PhLP1 could regulate AC5 activity. Indeed in panels <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> though 3G we provide evidence that exogenously added PhLP1 can also stimulate AC5 by releasing G\u03b1olf from the inhibitory constraints of G\u03b2\u03b3.

When building the model describing PhLP1 involvement, we rely on previous biochemical studies that established and extensively characterized direct interactions of PHLP1 with G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits (PNAS, 2015, 2413; JBC, 2009, 16386; Biochemistry, 1998, 15758). We understand that further studies will likely be needed to examine whether in addition to G\u03b2\u03b3 binding, PhLP1 also forms direct interactions with AC5 or G\u03b1olf. Thus, our scheme summarizing the conclusions from this work (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) is tempered and reflects only what we established beyond reasonable doubt (indirect effects through G\u03b2\u03b3)."

This coincides with the induction of Golf expression and maturation of medium spiny neurons. Thus, we think that morphological changes in the striatum that we observe are related to changes in G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 signaling. However, mechanisms of morphological changes in striatal neurons were not an emphasis of this report, hence we rather focused on signaling changes in adult brains. However, we agree that examining developmental mechanisms might be an important question to be addressed in future studies."

One can even get tricked by pre-immune serum from the same animal due to inflammation (acute phase effect). Here the investigators have an AC5 KO mouse.

However, haloperidol is a D2 and not D1 antagonist, and D1 but not D2 receptors couple to Golf. Of course 100 \u03bcM is a huge concentration of haloperidol, but so is 10 \u03bcM of dopamine.
