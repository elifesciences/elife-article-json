                    "text": "Calcium in the flagellum controls sperm navigation. In sperm of marine invertebrates and mammals, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling has been intensely studied, whereas for fish little is known. In sea urchin sperm, a cyclic nucleotide-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel (CNGK) mediates a cGMP-induced hyperpolarization that evokes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Here, we identify in sperm of the freshwater fish <i>Danio rerio</i> a novel CNGK family member featuring non-canonical properties. It is located in the sperm head rather than the flagellum and is controlled by intracellular pH, but not cyclic nucleotides. Alkalization hyperpolarizes sperm and produces Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces spinning-like swimming, different from swimming of sperm from other species. The \u201cspinning\u201d mode probably guides sperm into the micropyle, a narrow entrance on the surface of fish eggs. A picture is emerging of sperm channel orthologues that employ different activation mechanisms and serve different functions. The channel inventories probably reflect adaptations to species-specific challenges during fertilization."

In sperm of marine invertebrates and mammals, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling has been intensely studied, whereas for fish little is known. In sea urchin sperm, a cyclic nucleotide-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel (CNGK) mediates a cGMP-induced hyperpolarization that evokes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Here, we identify in sperm of the freshwater fish <i>Danio rerio</i> a novel CNGK family member featuring non-canonical properties. It is located in the sperm head rather than the flagellum and is controlled by intracellular pH, but not cyclic nucleotides. Alkalization hyperpolarizes sperm and produces Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces spinning-like swimming, different from swimming of sperm from other species. The \u201cspinning\u201d mode probably guides sperm into the micropyle, a narrow entrance on the surface of fish eggs. A picture is emerging of sperm channel orthologues that employ different activation mechanisms and serve different functions. The channel inventories probably reflect adaptations to species-specific challenges during fertilization."

In aquatic habitats, gametes are released into the water where sperm acquire motility and navigate to the egg. By contrast, mammalian fertilization happens in confined compartments of the female oviduct. From invertebrates to mammals, sperm use various sensing mechanisms, including chemotaxis, rheotaxis, and thermotaxis, to gather physical or chemical cues to spot the egg. These sensory cues activate various cellular signalling pathways that ultimately control the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) and, thereby, the flagellar beat and swimming behaviours (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alvarez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Darszon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Eisenbach and Giojalas, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Florman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Guerrero et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ho and Suarez, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kaupp et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Publicover et al., 2008</a>). In species as phylogenetically distant as sea urchin and mammals, these pathways target a sperm-specific, voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, called CatSper. Signalling events open CatSper by shifting its voltage-dependence to permissive, more negative V<sub>m</sub> values. This shift is achieved by different means. In sea urchin sperm, opening of a K<sup>+</sup>-selective cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGK) causes a transient hyperpolarization (<a href=\"#bib6\">B\u00f6nigk et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Str\u00fcnker et al., 2006</a>); the hyperpolarization activates a sperm-specific Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (sNHE) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Lee, 1984</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lee and Garbers, 1986</a>) resulting in a long-lasting alkalization that shifts the voltage dependence of CatSper and leads to a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kaupp et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Seifert et al., 2015</a>).

Instead, many fishes deposit sperm directly onto the eggs. For fertilization, sperm must search for the narrow entrance to a cone-shaped funnel in the egg coat \u2013 the micropyle \u2013 that provides access to the egg membrane. Sperm reach the micropyle probably by haptic interactions with tethered molecules that line the egg surface and the opening or interior of the micropyle (<a href=\"#bib41\">Iwamatsu et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Ohta and Iwamatsu, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Yanagimachi et al., 2013</a>).

Here, we study the function of the CNGK channel in sperm of the freshwater fish <i>Danio rerio (Dr</i>CNGK). The <i>Dr</i>CNGK channel constitutes the principal K<sup>+</sup> channel in <i>D. rerio</i> sperm. Unexpectedly, cyclic nucleotides neither regulate CNGK channel activity nor sperm motility; instead, intracellular alkalization, a key mechanism to control sperm function in many species, strongly activates CNGK and, thereby, triggers a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and a motility response. Although its mechanism of activation is entirely different compared to sea urchin sperm, the principal CNGK function, namely to provide a hyperpolarization that triggers a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, is conserved. Our results show that sperm signalling among aquatic species shows unique variations that probably represent adaptations to vastly different ionic milieus and fertilization habits."

Voltage steps from a holding potential of -65 mV evoked slightly inwardly rectifying currents (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Two pieces of evidence established that currents are carried by K<sup>+</sup> channels and not by Cl<sup>-</sup> channels. The reversal potential (V<sub>rev</sub>) shifted from -77 \u00b1 3 mV (n = 18) at 5.4 mM extracellular [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> to -7 \u00b1 1 mV\u00a0(n = 7) at 140 mM [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (\u25b3V<sub>rev</sub> = 51 \u00b1 3 mV/log [K<sup>+</sup>], n = 7) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Changing the intracellular [Cl<sup>-</sup>] did not affect V<sub>rev</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). These results demonstrate that the current is predominantly carried by K<sup>+</sup> ions. To localize the underlying K<sup>+</sup> channel, we recorded currents from isolated sperm heads (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D-G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, middle panel).

To test whether the <i>Dr</i>CNGK channel is also localized to the head, we used Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. To this end, the <i>Dr</i>CNGK protein was first characterized by heterologous expression in mammalian cell lines. <i>Dr</i>CNGK constructs with a C-terminal HA-tag or with two tags, a C-terminal HA-tag and an N-terminal flag-tag, were expressed in CHOK1 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In Western blots, the anti-HA-tag and the anti-flag-tag antibody labelled proteins of the same apparent molecular mass (M<sub>w</sub>)\u00a0(174 \u00b1 4 kDa (n = 13) and 175 \u00b1 4 kDa (n = 3), respectively) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The M<sub>w</sub> is smaller than the predicted M<sub>w</sub> of 244.4 kDa. Because flag-tag and HA-tag antibodies recognized the N- and C-terminal end of the CNGK protein, respectively, we conclude that the 175-kDa band represents the full-length protein that, however, displays an abnormal electrophoretic mobility similar to other CNG channels (<a href=\"#bib49\">K\u00f6rschen et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">1999</a>)."

                                "text": "The sea urchin <i>Ap</i>CNGK channel is opened by cyclic nucleotides and mediates the chemoattractant-induced hyperpolarization (<a href=\"#bib6\">B\u00f6nigk et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Str\u00fcnker et al., 2006</a>). Unexpectedly, patch-clamp recordings of K<sup>+</sup> currents from <i>D. rerio</i> sperm required no cyclic nucleotides in the pipette (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C-G</a>). Therefore, we scrutinized the action of cyclic nucleotides on sperm K<sup>+</sup> currents. Mean current amplitudes were similar in controls and in the presence of either cAMP or cGMP (100 \u00b5M) in the pipette solution (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We used also caged cyclic nucleotides to study the K<sup>+</sup> current in the absence and presence of cyclic nucleotides in the same sperm cell (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kaupp et al., 2003</a>). Photo-release of cAMP or cGMP from caged precursors did not affect K<sup>+</sup> currents, suggesting that cyclic nucleotides do not modulate <i>Dr</i>CNGK (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In contrast, the photo-release of cAMP or cGMP induced a rapid current increase in heterologously expressed cyclic nucleotide-gated channels <i>Ap</i>CNGK from sea urchin (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). We also heterologously expressed the <i>Dr</i>CNGK channel in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. The current-voltage (IV) relation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>), K<sup>+</sup> dependence (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A-D</a>), and block by external TEA (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>) was similar to that of the K<sup>+</sup> current recorded from <i>D. rerio</i> sperm. Moreover, currents in oocytes were also insensitive to the membrane-permeable analogs 8Br-cAMP and 8Br-cGMP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>), whereas perfusion with 8Br-cGMP increased currents in oocytes that express the <i>Ap</i>CNGK channel from <i>A. punctulata</i> sperm (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>)."

In classical K<sup>+</sup> channels, block by intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib62\">Matsuda et al., 1987</a>) or spermine (<a href=\"#bib31\">Fakler et al., 1995</a>) produces inward rectification. However, neither Mg<sup>2+</sup> nor spermine affected <i>Ap</i>CNGK rectification (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Instead, intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> blocked outward currents in a strong voltage- and dose-dependent fashion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>). In the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>, the IV relation of <i>Ap</i>CNGK and <i>Dr</i>CNGK channels converged (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). We searched the pore regions of CNGK channels for clues regarding the molecular basis of the Na<sup>+</sup> block. In three of the four <i>Ap</i>CNGK pore motifs, we identified a Thr residue that in most K<sup>+</sup> channels is replaced by a Val or Ile residue (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). When these Thr residues were changed to Val, the strong rectification of the mutant <i>Ap</i>CNGK channel was lost and the IV relation became similar to that of the <i>Dr</i>CNGK channel (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). We also tested the reverse construct, introducing Thr residues into the pore motif of <i>Dr</i>CNGK channels. For unknown reasons, the mutants did not form functional channels."

                                "text": "Intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) is an important factor controlling sperm motility in marine invertebrates and mammals (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alavi and Cosson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Dziewulska and Domagala, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Hirohashi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Lishko et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Lishko and Kirichok, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Nishigaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Santi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Seifert et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, in mouse sperm, the Slo3 channels and the CatSper channels are exquisitely pH-sensitive (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kirichok et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Schreiber et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Zeng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Zhang et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">2006b</a>). Therefore, we examined whether <i>Dr</i>CNGK is controlled by pH<sub>i</sub>. At pH<sub>i</sub> 6.4, almost no CNGK current was recorded from <i>D. rerio</i> sperm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, left panel, B,C). To rule out that an increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (from 91 pM to 7.7 nM, see Materials and methods) due to the reduced buffering capacity of EGTA at pH 6.4 is responsible for current inhibition, we recorded sperm currents at pH 7.4 with a free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 1 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Under these conditions, the K<sup>+</sup> current in sperm was still large, indicating that protons and not Ca<sup>2+</sup>, at least for the concentrations tested, are responsible for current inhibition. Exposing sperm to 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl rapidly elevates pH<sub>i</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), because NH<sub>4</sub>Cl overcomes the buffer capacity of HEPES at pH 6.4 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boron and De Weer, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Seifert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Str\u00fcnker et al., 2011</a>). Alkaline pH<sub>i</sub> strongly enhanced CNGK currents (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, middle panel, B,C). Subsequent superfusion with 10 mM propionic acid, which lowers pH<sub>i</sub>, completely reversed the NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-induced CNGK currents (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, right panel, B and C). The NH<sub>4</sub>Cl action was very pronounced: 1 mM activated approximately 40% of the CNGK current; at 10 mM, the current was maximal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, triangles). To quantitatively determine the pH dependence, we recorded sperm K<sup>+</sup> currents at different intracellular pH<sub>i</sub> values (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a> circles). The current is half-maximally activated at pH 7.08. The pH dependence allows to calibrate the NH<sub>4</sub>Cl action by superposing the data of the two different experimental conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>): For example, at an NH<sub>4</sub>Cl concentration of 1.5 mM, pH<sub>i</sub> in sperm will increase from 6.4 to 7.08 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Under current-clamp conditions, alkalization of <i>D. rerio</i> sperm with 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl evoked a rapid and reversible hyperpolarization from -49 \u00b1 7 mV to -71 \u00b1 4 mV (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, n = 10). We also studied the pH regulation of the <i>Dr</i>CNGK channel expressed in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes. Oocytes were first perfused with a K<sup>+</sup> bicarbonate solution, followed by a K<sup>+</sup> gluconate-based solution including 1 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). 1 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl reversibly increased <i>Dr</i>CNGK currents by approximately 71%, demonstrating regulation by pH<sub>i</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Higher concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl further increased the <i>Dr</i>CNGK current; however, these conditions also elicited significant currents in control oocytes, thus precluding quantitative analysis. Furthermore, we tested, whether DrCNGK channels in oocytes are activated by hypoosmotic conditions. Reducing the osmolarity by ~50% does not significantly change <i>Dr</i>CNGK currents in oocytes (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, n = 4). In sea urchin sperm, CNGK-mediated hyperpolarization leads to an increase of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, we tested, whether the NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-induced hyperpolarization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) and alkalization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>) evokes a Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. In fact, mixing of <i>D. rerio\u00a0</i>\u00a0sperm with 10 or 30 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl gave rise to a rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>, n = 4). The time course of the pH<sub>i</sub>- and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was similar, suggesting that the CNGK-mediated hyperpolarization triggers a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. We conclude that <i>Dr</i>CNGK represents a pH-sensitive channel that is strongly activated at alkaline pH<sub>i</sub>; the ensuing hyperpolarization, like in sea urchin sperm, produces a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal."

Sperm motility was activated by hypoosmotic dilution (1:20 into 70 mM Na<sup>+</sup> ES, 167 mOsm x L<sup>-1</sup>) and was followed under a dark-field microscope (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Unstimulated sperm swam on curvilinear trajectories of low curvature (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A-F</a>, green segment, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). A UV flash almost instantaneously increased path curvature in NP-EGTA-loaded sperm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D-F,I</a>), but not in control sperm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A-C,I</a>); sperm swam on much narrower arcs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D-F</a>, red segment, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The increase of path curvature was even more pronounced after a second UV flash (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6 D-F</a>, cyan segment, I, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Many cells were pushing against the wall of the observation chamber and performed a \u2018spinning\u2019 or \u2018drilling\u2019 behaviour, as if to penetrate the wall (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). The asymmetry of the flagellar beat increased with each consecutive photo-release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and eventually the flagellum pointed away from the glass surface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This swimming behaviour likely represents a strategy followed by sperm on its search for the micropyle, a small opening (outer diameter about 8 \u00b5m in diameter) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hart and Danovan, 1983</a>) on the surface of the much larger egg (about 0.75 mm in diameter) (<a href=\"#bib79\">Selman et al., 1993</a>). A similar swimming behaviour during fertilization has been reported for sperm of herring and black flounder (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cherr et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Yanagimachi et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">2013</a>).

                        "text": "First, although the <i>D. rerio</i> CNGK carries four canonical CNBDs, it is gated by pH<sub>i</sub> rather than cyclic nucleotides, indicating that the CNBDs have lost their genuine ligand selectivity. The related <i>Ap</i>CNGK channel from sea urchin sperm is also unique in that it displays an unusual cGMP dependence: Unlike \u201cclassic\u201d cooperative CNG channels, it is gated by binding of a single cGMP molecule to the third CNBD, implying that the other CNBDs are non-functional (<a href=\"#bib6\">B\u00f6nigk et al., 2009</a>). Because the <i>Ap</i>CNGK channel is activated through binding of cGMP to the third repeat, we searched for sequence alterations in the third repeat of the <i>Dr</i>CNGK channel. Strikingly, in the C-linker region of the third repeat, we identified an insert of 42 amino-acid residues (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, blue) that is absent in other cyclic nucleotide-regulated channels. The insert shows no sequence similarity to any known functional domain of ion channels. One hypothesis is that this insert prevents the transmission of the binding signal to the channel pore. Another sequence peculiarity is identified in the second repeat (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). At amino-acid position 934, an Ala residue replaces a highly conserved Arg residue that is crucial for cyclic-nucleotide binding (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kaupp and Seifert, 2002</a>). The CNBDs of repeat 1 and 4 do not show obvious sequence abnormalities and could represent <i>bona fide</i> CNBDs (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In recent years, many structures of CNBDs have been solved (<a href=\"#bib20\">Clayton et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kesters et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kim et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Rehmann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Sch\u00fcnke et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sch\u00fcnke et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Zagotta et al., 2003</a>). Can we learn from these structures something about the <i>Dr</i>CNGK channel? Most of the CNBD structures feature a similar fold and are able to bind both cAMP and cGMP. However, for some CNG channels, ligands are full agonists, like cAMP and cGMP in the CNGA2 channel (<a href=\"#bib26\">Dhallan et al., 1990</a>), only partial agonists, like cAMP in the CNGA1 channel (<a href=\"#bib3\">Altenhofen et al., 1991</a>), or competitive antagonists, like cGMP in the bacterial SthK channel (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brams et al., 2014</a>). Finally, in HCN channels, CNBDs interact and form a so-called gating ring (<a href=\"#bib93\">Zagotta et al., 2003</a>), whereas in MloK1 channel, CNBDs do not interact at all (<a href=\"#bib22\">Cukkemane et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sch\u00fcnke et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">2011</a>). In conclusion, at present, no sequence features can be identified that unequivocally explain the lack of cyclic-nucleotide regulation of the <i>Dr</i>CNGK channel."

Instead, small molecules such as flavonoids have been suggested as ligands that bind to the CNBD and modulate channel activity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brelidze et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Carlson et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, in the C-terminus of these CNBDs, a conserved segment of residues was identified that occupies the CNBD and serves as an intrinsic \u201cligand\u201d (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brelidze et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Carlson et al., 2013</a>). We can only speculate, that, in addition to protons, as yet unidentified ligands might bind to and regulate the <i>Dr</i>CNGK channel. The apparent pK<sub>a</sub> value for channel activation by pH was approximately 7, suggesting that a His residue controls channel opening. There are a number of His residues in the C-linker of the four repeats that might serve as candidate sites.

Boundary conditions might constrain sperm to develop different signalling strategies for similar functions. One obvious constraint is the ionic milieu, which strongly affects ion channel function. In freshwater, ion concentrations are low and opening of Na<sup>+</sup>-, K<sup>+</sup>-, and non-selective cation channels would hyperpolarize rather than depolarize cells. We speculate that, in freshwater fish, a depolarization-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel like CatSper may not work and has been replaced by another Ca<sub>v</sub> channel."

Na<sup>+</sup> blockage of sea urchin CNGK resists hyperpolarization in seawater and, thereby, facilitates the opening of depolarization-activated CatSper channels. The observation that CNGK channels from seawater organisms carry this Thr residue indicates a specific evolutionary pressure on this pore residue. Why is this Thr residue lost in CNGK channels of freshwater organisms? We speculate that Na<sup>+</sup> blockage disappeared along with the loss of CatSper genes and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions enter fish sperm through a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel that is activated by hyperpolarization rather than depolarization. Future work needs to identify this Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, its mechanism of activation, and its role for fertilization of teleost fish."

They also cloned and did preliminary characterization of an atypical K<sup>+</sup> channel CNGK. Unlike mammalian sperm, the freshwater fish sperm do not have cyclic nucleotide activated-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, nor do they have CatSper channels, which mediates the major Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in mammalian and sea urchin sperm. The data in the paper is consistent with the model in which the fresh water fish uses a different mechanism to mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx for sperm function: instead of using alkalinization-activated, depolarization-potentiated CatSper, the fish sperm use alkalinization-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel followed by hyperpolarization-potentiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The findings thus emphasize the different approaches animals have evolved for sperm Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in response to the drastically different environment."
