Most animals, including humans, have habitual feeding patterns in which meals are consumed based on learned and/or environmental factors. Here we illuminate a novel neural system regulating higher-order aspects of feeding through which the gut-derived hormone ghrelin communicates with ventral hippocampus (vHP) neurons to stimulate meal-entrained conditioned appetite. Additional results show that the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) is a critical downstream substrate for vHP ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia and that vHP ghrelin activated neurons communicate directly with neurons in the LHA that express the neuropeptide, orexin. Furthermore, activation of downstream orexin-1 receptors is required for vHP ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia. These findings reveal novel neurobiological circuitry regulating appetite through which ghrelin signaling in hippocampal neurons engages LHA orexin signaling."

Most animals, including humans, have habitual feeding patterns in which meals are consumed based on learned and/or environmental factors. Here we illuminate a novel neural system regulating higher-order aspects of feeding through which the gut-derived hormone ghrelin communicates with ventral hippocampus (vHP) neurons to stimulate meal-entrained conditioned appetite. Additional results show that the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) is a critical downstream substrate for vHP ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia and that vHP ghrelin activated neurons communicate directly with neurons in the LHA that express the neuropeptide, orexin. Furthermore, activation of downstream orexin-1 receptors is required for vHP ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia. These findings reveal novel neurobiological circuitry regulating appetite through which ghrelin signaling in hippocampal neurons engages LHA orexin signaling."

Rather, most animals (including humans) have habitual feeding patterns, consuming a fixed number of meals at approximately the same time each day. Environmental stimuli associated with learned meal anticipation elicit preparatory biological \u2018cephalic\u2019 responses (e.g., pancreatic insulin release) that occur prior to food consumption (<a href=\"#bib79\">Woods and Ramsay, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Woods et al., 1970</a>). These types of conditioned biological responses are advantageous when environmental factors place constraints on eating (e.g., predator threat, limited periods of food availability, and social or professional obligations) because they promote consumption of a large quantity of food within a relatively short time period. One important biological signal associated with conditioned appetite and feeding is ghrelin, a hormone derived from P/D1 cells in the stomach that is the only known circulating hormone that increases food intake(<a href=\"#bib76\">Tsch\u00f6p et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cowley et al., 2003</a>). While often referred to as a \u2018hunger\u2019 hormone, ghrelin is perhaps more aptly described as a meal-anticipatory hormone based on findings from both humans and rodents showing that ghrelin levels rise before an anticipated feeding bout independent of energy deprivation levels (<a href=\"#bib22\">Frecka and Mattes, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cummings et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Drazen et al., 2006</a>). Genetic deletion of the ghrelin receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1A; GHSR) eliminates food anticipatory activity under meal entrainment feeding schedules(<a href=\"#bib5\">Blum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Davis et al., 2011</a>), further supporting the notion that ghrelin acts as a conditioned meal-anticipatory signal."

GHSR is expressed abundantly in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mani et al., 2014</a>), and we recently demonstrated that pharmacological activation of GHSR by ghrelin in ventral/temporal subregions of the hippocampus (vHP) potently stimulates food intake by increasing both meal frequency and meal size (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kanoski et al., 2013</a>).

Classic studies show that LHA electrical ablation results in profound hypophagia (<a href=\"#bib71\">Teitelbaum and Epstein, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Anand and Brobeck, 1951</a>), whereas LHA electrical stimulation robustly increases food intake (<a href=\"#bib19\">Delgado and Anand, 1953</a>). The LHA has direct connections with brain regions involved in the regulation of energy balance, including the hypothalamic arcuate and paraventricular nuclei (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hahn and Swanson, 2015</a>), and the medial nucleus of the solitary tract (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ciriello et al., 2013</a>). In addition, the LHA is also directly connected with several brain regions that regulate \u2018higher-order\u2019 cognitive aspects of feeding behavior, including the vHP, amygdala, nucleus accumbens (ACB), and ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hahn and Swanson, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hahn and Swanson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hahn and Swanson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Goto et al., 2005</a>). Of note, vHP pyramidal neurons in field CA1 and the subiculum are a major source of direct and exclusively ipsilateral input to the LHA, especially the dorsal perifornical LHA (dpLHA) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hahn and Swanson, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hahn and Swanson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kishi et al., 2000</a>).

We employed a combination of methods to facilitate a correlative approach, including neural pathway-tracing, immunohistochemistry, behavioral neuropharmacology, meal entrainment conditioning, and excitotoxic unilateral lesion-mediated neural \u2018disconnection\u2019 between pharmacological vHP GHSR activation and the dpLHA.

Bilateral parenchymal delivery of the selective GHSR antagonist, JMV2959 (10 \u03bcg) to vHP neurons significantly reduced 4\u2009hr chow intake in meal-entrained rats (p&lt;0.05; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Moreover, the JMV2959-induced intake reduction observed in meal-entrained rats appears to be specific to conditioned feeding behavior as opposed to being based on higher baseline kcal consumption in meal entrained vs. control rats. This is supported by results showing that vHP JMV2959 administration did not reduce 4\u2009hr Western diet intake in non-meal entrained, non-food restricted rats under conditions in which total kcal intake exceeded levels observed in meal-entrained rats (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Food intake was measured after unilateral vHP administration of ghrelin (300 pmol) to rats with dpLHA lesions or sham lesions that were either ipsilateral or contralateral to the side of ghrelin administration (i.e. vHP to LHA communication either eliminated or intact). Ghrelin delivered to the vHP contralateral to the LHA lesion (or sham lesion) significantly increased chow intake in both groups, whereas ghrelin delivered to the vHP ipsilateral to the LHA lesion (or sham lesion) significantly increased food intake only in the Sham group (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>; *indicates p&lt;0.05 vs. vehicle treatment, <b>\u0166</b> indicates p&lt;0.07 vs. vehicle treatment).

Compared to equivalent levels of food restriction, the anticipation of eating in meal entrained rats had a greater stimulatory effect on ghrelin release (<a href=\"#bib20\">Drazen et al., 2006</a>), indicating that ghrelin acts as a meal anticipation hormonal signal that facilitates the consumption of large quantities of food. This notion is also consistent with data showing a role for ghrelin in stimulating gastric motility (<a href=\"#bib45\">Masuda et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Peeters, 2003</a>) and increasing meal size (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kanoski et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Swartz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">de Lartigue et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Faulconbridge et al., 2003</a>). Here we identify and characterize a novel neural substrate extending these previous findings by demonstrating that vHP ghrelin signaling is physiologically relevant for conditioned feeding behavior. After exposure to a meal entrainment schedule in which rats were restricted to 4\u2009hr food access each day, pharmacological blockade of vHP GHSR signaling prior to food access significantly reduced 4\u2009hr chow consumption. Comparatively, vHP GHSR blockade had no effect on a 4\u2009hr chow intake in equally food-restricted rats that had not undergone the meal entrainment learning. Moreover, the intake reduction appears to be specific to conditioned feeding behavior as opposed to being based on higher baseline kcal consumption in meal entrained vs. control rats. This is supported by results showing that vHP JMV2959 administration did not reduce Western diet intake in non-food deprived, non-meal entrained animals under conditions where baseline kcal intake of the Western diet was actually higher than in meal-entrained rats consuming chow. However, another study showed that peripheral GHSR antagonist (Compound 26) delivery failed to suppress feeding in meal-entrained mice (<a href=\"#bib54\">Perello et al., 2010</a>), yet we note that this previous study utilized a different GHSR antagonist, a different species, and a different route of administration (peripheral). Collectively, these findings build on previous work showing that pharmacological vHP GHSR activation increases meal frequency and size (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kanoski et al., 2013</a>). Here we establish the endogenous relevance of vHP GHSR signaling to a specific component of feeding \u2013 conditioned feeding. We hypothesize that pharmacologically induced hyperphagia following vHP ghrelin injections occurs, at least in part, by augmenting the saliency of conditioned food-relevant interoceptive stimuli and/or external cues that are present in the environment."

Our data confirm the existence of an exclusively ipsilateral direct input to the dpLHA from the vHP field CA1, and further demonstrate that ~85% of vHP field CA1 neurons retrogradely labeled from the dpLHA are immunoreactive for GHSR.

A direct connection from the vHP to dpLHA neurons was confirmed by the presence of PHAL-immunoreactive axons in the dpLHA following vHP field CA1 PHAL injections. Several instances of PHAL-labeled axons with varicosities and terminal boutons were recorded in close apposition to dpLHA ORX-expressing neurons. Triple-labeling for PHAL, ORX and the presynaptic marker synaptophysin indicated that some of these close appositions were putative sites of synaptic input. Next, we tested whether vHP GHSR activation engages dpLHA orexin neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis of Fos and orexin expression in the dpLHA in rats treated with vHP ghrelin or vehicle injections revealed Fos expression in approximately 70% of dpLHA orexin-expressing neurons. Taken together, these findings indicate a functional pathway involving GHSR-expressing vHP field CA1 neurons and their downstream communication to dpLHA orexin neurons."

This approach takes advantage of an exclusively ipsilateral connection between the vHP and the LHA. Results show that vHP ghrelin administration ipsilateral to unilateral LHA lesions (vHP GHSR to LHA communication eliminated) blocks vHP ghrelin-activated hyperphagia that occurs in rats with sham lesions, and that also occurs when vHP ghrelin injections are given contralateral to the unilateral dpLHA lesion (vHP GHSR to LHA communication intact).

However, our data from Exp. 1 provide strong support for the endogenous relevance of vHP ghrelin signaling system for conditioned food intake. We hypothesize that the robust hyperphagic response following vHP GHSR activation during free feeding conditions is based, at least in part, on pharmacologically activating conditioned feeding behavior in the presence of food-associated cues. In other words, pharmacological vHP GHSR activation is potentially bolstering the saliency of internal (e.g., circadian, metabolic) or external cues within the animal\u2019s environment (e.g., food hopper) that have the capacity to promote feeding behavior based on learned associations with feeding. Consistent with this framework, vHP GHSR activation increases meal frequency in response to external environmental stimuli (auditory, visual) that were associated with palatable food access, whereas vHP ghrelin signaling does not augment feeding in response to control stimuli with no prior food association (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kanoski et al., 2013</a>). However, because present data do not directly assess the functional importance of vHP ghrelin to LHA orexin neural circuitry in conditioned feeding, we acknowledge that this pathway might also mediate aspects of non-conditioned appetite and feeding behavior. Indeed, ghrelin signaling in other brains regions appears to stimulate non-conditioned appetitive responding (<a href=\"#bib64\">Skibicka et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Skibicka et al., 2013</a>). For example, ICV or intra-amydala administration of the same GHSR antagonist used in this study (JMV2959) reduces free feeding in fasted (non-entrained) animals (<a href=\"#bib63\">Salom\u00e9 et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alvarez-Crespo et al., 2012</a>)."

These findings suggest that in addition to the vHP, the LHA might also be a target for ghrelinergic conditioned feeding responses. However, our present data reveal that intra-LHA JMV2959 (including a dose that was effective in the vHP) had no effect on food intake in meal-entrained and non-meal-entrained animals, suggesting that while ghrelin signaling in various brain regions stimulates non-conditioned feeding behavior, vHP ghrelin signaling is a potentially unique neural substrate for learned aspects of feeding behavior.

While the anatomical and behavioral data in the current study suggest that vHP neurons communicate ghrelinergic signaling to the dpLHA directly, we recognize that multisynaptic pathways are also likely be involved. In addition to providing an input to the LHA, vHP field CA1 neurons also provide an input to several other feeding-related brain regions, including the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ishikawa and Nakamura, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</a>).

However, because ventricular injections spread throughout the CNS and Ox1R s are expressed throughout the brain, (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hervieu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Marcus et al., 2001</a>), we can only speculate as to the mediating sites of Ox1R activation. Recent research has shown that blockade of Ox1Rs in the VTA attenuates food intake induced by LV ghrelin (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cone et al., 2014</a>). Given these findings, and the role of VTA dopaminergic signaling in various aspects of feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cone et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Skibicka et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nieh et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Liu and Borgland, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Narayanan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cacciapaglia et al., 2011</a>), we hypothesize that VTA Ox1R signaling is a critical downstream target of vHP ghrelin to dpLHA orexin signaling, however, this remains to be tested. Previous literature has also shown that central orexin signaling has roles in sleep/wake and arousal in addition to regulating feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hagan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chemelli et al., 1999</a>). The current study did not directly assess the relationship between vHP ghrelin signaling and orexin mediated arousal. It is possible that the enhanced saliency of external food-related cues following vHP ghrelin signaling is mediated by increased arousal, as well as potential changes to circadian activity, from downstream activation of central Ox1R's (possibly in the locus coeruleus).

Statistical analyses were conducted with computer software (Statistica V7; Statsoft). To ensure the minimum sample size required to be reasonably likely to detect the hypothesized effect, power analyses were conducted for each proposed experiment based on our pilot and recently published experiments using Statsoft software (Statistica 64, V7). Alpha level was set at 0.05 for power analyses; the Root Mean Square Standardized Effect (RMSSE) was estimated separately for each experiment"

If the authors want to broaden the role of ghrelin acting on the 'hippocampus to orexin neuron circuit' to mediate many aspects a feeding, then they should compare the relative importance of hippocampal input to orexin neurons with other potential inputs (reviewer #2 comment 3).

However, I think it is premature with the data provide to attribute this pathway as being relevant specifically to their model of conditioned feeding. Only in the experiments summarized in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> was the meal entrainment done \u2013 and for those experiments, injections of a GHSR antagonist directly into the vHP were used to confirm that GHSR-expressing vHP neurons were important for conditioned feeding (but not for 4\u2009hr rebound feeding following a 20\u2009hr food restriction). In the subsequent experiments, neuroanatomic techniques were used to track the projections of GHSR-expressing/ghrelin-responsive neurons to the LHA. Also, the orexigenic effects of pharmacologic ghrelin-injections into the vHP were assessed in LHA-lesioned animals or Orexin receptor blocker-administered animals. Activation of LHA neurons was also assessed in animals administered ghrelin into the vHP. Thus, while GHSR-expressing vHP neurons appear to be important for conditioned feeding, the GHSR-expressing vHP neurons projecting to the LHA orexin neurons are not necessarily involved in that particular aspect of ghrelin-induced eating. Thus, the possible role of this newly described pathway in a broader scope of ghrelin's many feeding-related actions should be mentioned. If the investigators want to limit this pathway to conditioned feeding, further physiologic experiments would be needed \u2013 e.g., inhibit downstream portions of that pathway and determine how it affects conditioned feeding."

A limitation of the manuscript is that the authors do not actually show this. First, they show that hippocampal ghrelin augments conditioned bouts of feeding. They then go on to show that hippocampal ghrelin increases unconditioned food intake and this requires an intact ipsilateral LH (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and the availability of central orexin receptors (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). However, the authors do not show that central orexin receptors are required for ventral hippocampal ghrelin to augment conditioned feeding. Repeating the approach in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> but infusing either vehicle or the SB334867 into the lateral ventricle would solidify the argument. The use of an orexin saporin for a selective LH lesion would also solidify the argument."

They compare these groups separately according to whether or not the animals had an LH lesion or sham (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). These data should be combined and compared using an ANOVA with main effects of surgery (Lesion, Sham) and treatment (Vehicle, Ghrelin). This comparison will help parse out any non-specific effects of the LH lesion unrelated to ghrelin treatment. Moreover, this is critical because bilateral LH lesions are well known to alter feeding behavior and it appears there are differences in the amount of food consumed between the lesion and sham animals that received vehicle. For example, compare food intake vehicle treated animals in lesion and sham groups at 1\u2009hr and 5\u2009hr."

However, if the authors posit that the source for vHP GHSR activation is peripheral ghrelin evoked by interoceptive or external cues then GHSRs are likely to be activated in other brain regions where they are expressed \u2013 including LHA GHSRs. LHA orexin neurons express GHSRs and are activated by cues. While the authors are to be commended for showing that vHP GHSRs are required for the full expression of conditioned feeding in the present paradigm \u2013 supporting an endogenous roll for ghrelin in the vHP, the manuscript would be strengthened by investigating another GHSR-rich region to determine if similar effects are observed or whether the GHSRs in the vHP uniquely participated in meal-entrained conditioned feeding. At the very least, this unresolved issue should be discussed."

The authors need to include data for the 'conditioned feeding' paradigm in their experiments #3 and #6 if they want to make the claims proposed in title and Abstract.</i> "

We acknowledge the possibility that the hippocampal ghrelin to lateral hypothalamic orexin circuit could potentially be involved in aspects of appetite and feeding behavior other than conditioned feeding. We further agree that the data presented in Exp. 3 and 6 do not directly assess the importance of this circuit in conditioned feeding. To address this issue, we considered repeating the conditioned feeding paradigm using designs parallel to Exps. 3 and 6, however, we note that the animals are robustly hyperphagic during 20\u2009hr food restricted meal entrainment conditions, and thereby activation of vHP ghrelin receptors would be unlikely to augment intake from a high baseline of excessive food intake (i.e., ceiling effect). Moreover, an antagonist approach for the ghrelin receptor in Exps. 3 and 6 is not logical since these studies are designed to investigate downstream pathways."

Accordingly, we have revised the title and Abstract, extended our Discussion, and modified the overall language throughout the manuscript to reflect a broader discussion of the role of ghrelin signaling in the hippocampus and elsewhere in the brain in many aspects of feeding behavior. For example, our title now reads, \"Hippocampus ghrelin signaling mediates appetite through lateral hypothalamic orexin pathways\", and \"learned feeding aspects of feeding behavior\" was explicitly removed from the Abstract. Other instances include the Introduction and Discussion (end of last three paragraphs). While we retain the viewpoint that hippocampal ghrelin signaling is critical for conditioned feeding (based on Exp.1), in this revised manuscript, we do not disregard the possibility of the vHP-LHA circuitry as being involved in a variety of other food-motivated behaviors. Overall our extended discussion uses a more cautious tone with regards to vHP ghrelin having an exclusive role in conditioned feeding."

                    "text": "As specifically suggested by Reviewer #2 we have added an additional experiment which compares the relative importance of hippocampal GHSR mediated conditioned feeding with another GHSR rich region, the lateral hypothalamus (LHA). As stated by Reviewer #2, the LHA contains orexin producing neurons that are activated by both LHA ghrelin infusion and by external food-related cues (Olszewski et al., 2003; Petrovich et al. 2012). Moreover, LHA ghrelin infusion (like vHP ghrelin infusion) increases food intake in rats (Olszewski et al., 2003). Therefore, the LHA is a logical additional target of potential importance for ghrelin-mediated conditioned feeding effects. Our new experiment replicates Exp.1, except that the GHSR-1A receptor antagonist, JMV2959, is now administered bilaterally to the LHA in meal-entrained animals and non-entrained animals (20\u2009hr food deprived). We have included this new experiment in the manuscript, and the results (described in subsection \u201cEndogenous ghrelin signaling in LHA neurons does not regulate conditioned feeding behavior\u201d) are displayed in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Our results show that GHSR blockade using a dose of JMV2959 that was effective in the vHP had no effect on entrained food intake or non-entrained food intake in similarly food-restricted animals. These findings suggest that vHP ghrelin signaling is particularly critical in the expression of conditioned feeding behavior based on internal (or potentially external) contextual cues, whereas LHA ghrelin signaling could be mediating other aspects of appetite and feeding. In this revised manuscript we now further elaborate in the Discussion on the feeding effects of ghrelin in brain regions such as the lateral hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, and amygdala (Olszewski et al., 2003;, Perello et al., 2010; Skibicka et al., 2011; Alvarez-Crespo et al., 2012) as well as other feeding effects of downstream orexin signaling (Zhu et al., 2002; Goforth et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2007; Parise et al., 2011; Harris et al., 2005; Thorpe et al., 2005; Thorpe et al., 2006). The specific mechanisms underlying LHA ghrelin mediated feeding will require further studies beyond the scope of this manuscript, but we believe that this additional experiment adds further support for the importance of vHP GHSR-1A signaling specifically in mediating conditioned feeding effects and improves the overall quality of the manuscript."

However, I think it is premature with the data provide to attribute this pathway as being relevant specifically to their model of conditioned feeding. Only in the experiments summarized in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> was the meal entrainment done \u2013 and for those experiments, injections of a GHSR antagonist directly into the vHP were used to confirm that GHSR-expressing vHP neurons were important for conditioned feeding (but not for 4\u2009hr rebound feeding following a 20\u2009hr food restriction). In the subsequent experiments, neuroanatomic techniques were used to track the projections of GHSR-expressing/ghrelin-responsive neurons to the LHA. Also, the orexigenic effects of pharmacologic ghrelin-injections into the vHP were assessed in LHA-lesioned animals or Orexin receptor blocker-administered animals. Activation of LHA neurons was also assessed in animals administered ghrelin into the vHP. Thus, while GHSR-expressing vHP neurons appear to be important for conditioned feeding, the GHSR-expressing vHP neurons projecting to the LHA orexin neurons are not necessarily involved in that particular aspect of ghrelin-induced eating. Thus, the possible role of this newly described pathway in a broader scope of ghrelin's many feeding-related actions should be mentioned. If the investigators want to limit this pathway to conditioned feeding, further physiologic experiments would be needed \u2013 e.g., inhibit downstream portions of that pathway and determine how it affects conditioned feeding.</i> "

The authors provide ample data to support most of their conclusions. I have three major comments that need to be addressed: 1) A key argument, and the title of the paper, posits that ghrelin action in the ventral hippocampus augments the conditioned aspects of feeding through LH orexin neurons. A limitation of the manuscript is that the authors do not actually show this. First, they show that hippocampal ghrelin augments conditioned bouts of feeding. They then go on to show that hippocampal ghrelin increases unconditioned food intake and this requires an intact ipsilateral LH (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and the availability of central orexin receptors (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). However, the authors do not show that central orexin receptors are required for ventral hippocampal ghrelin to augment conditioned feeding. Repeating the approach in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> but infusing either vehicle or the SB334867 into the lateral ventricle would solidify the argument. The use of an orexin saporin for a selective LH lesion would also solidify the argument.</i> "

Thus, as an alternative to address this caveat, we have now stressed throughout this revised manuscript that while vHP ghrelin signaling has important roles in conditioned feeding, it may well be the case that vHP ghrelin to LHA orexin neural circuitry has broader roles in feeding behavior, particularly given that orexin signaling and the LHA neural processing are involved in several aspects of feeding behavior (Zhu et al., 2002; Goforth et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2007; Parise et al., 2011; Harris et al., 2005; Thorpe et al., 2005; Thorpe et al., 2006), (Stanley et al., 2011; Jennings et al., 2013; Legrand et al., 2015; Cason and Aston-Jones, 2013).

These data should be combined and compared using an ANOVA with main effects of surgery (Lesion, Sham) and treatment (Vehicle, Ghrelin). This comparison will help parse out any non-specific effects of the LH lesion unrelated to ghrelin treatment. Moreover, this is critical because bilateral LH lesions are well known to alter feeding behavior and it appears there are differences in the amount of food consumed between the lesion and sham animals that received vehicle. For example, compare food intake vehicle treated animals in lesion and sham groups at 1\u2009hr and 5\u2009hr.</i> "
