Here we show that dopamine, a positive reinforcement signal, can retroactively convert hippocampal timing-dependent synaptic depression into potentiation. This effect requires functional NMDA receptors and is mediated in part through the activation of the cAMP/PKA cascade. Collectively, our results support the idea that reward-related signaling can act on a pre-established synaptic eligibility trace, thereby associating specific experiences with behaviorally distant, rewarding outcomes. This finding identifies a biologically plausible mechanism for solving the \u2018distal reward problem\u2019."

In its classic form, STDP depends on the order and precise timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes: pre-before-post spike pairings induce timing-dependent long-term potentiation (t-LTP), whereas post-before-pre pairings induce timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Markram et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bi and Poo, 1998</a>). However, the quantitative rules of STDP are profoundly influenced by neuromodulators (<a href=\"#bib41\">Seol et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pawlak et al., 2010</a>), including dopamine (DA) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Edelmann and Lessmann, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yang and Dani, 2014</a>). Although it is well established that reward-motivated behavior depends on the activity of DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Suri and Schultz, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pan et al., 2005</a>), the mechanisms that associate specific experiences with rewarding outcomes, which typically occur after a delay, are not well understood. This is referred to as the <i>distal reward problem</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hull, 1943</a>). To address this problem, here, we examined whether DA modulates STDP not only when applied during, but also\u2014more importantly\u2014when applied <i>after</i> the pairing event."

To this end, we monitored excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that were evoked by extracellular stimulation of the Schaffer-collateral-CA1 pathway during whole-cell recordings of CA1 pyramidal cells in mouse horizontal slices (postnatal days 12\u201318; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Plasticity was induced in current clamp mode using an induction protocol that involved 100 pairings of a single EPSP followed by a single postsynaptic spike (t-LTP; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) or a single postsynaptic spike followed by a single EPSP (t-LTD; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) at 0.2 Hz. Consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bi and Poo, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Edelmann and Lessmann, 2011</a>), the pre-before-post pairing protocol with \u0394t = +10 ms induced t-LTP (182 \u00b1 14%; <i>t</i>(4) = 5.6, p = 0.0049 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 5; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and the post-before-pre pairing protocol with \u0394t = \u221220 ms induced t-LTD (61 \u00b1 9%; <i>t</i>(4) = 4.4, p = 0.0121 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 5; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Surprisingly, however, we found that the post-before-pre pairing protocol with \u0394t = \u221210 ms instead of inducing t-LTD, elicited robust t-LTP (202 \u00b1 21%; <i>t</i>(6) = 5.0, p = 0.0025 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 7; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D,G</a>). This conflicts with previous reports from hippocampal cultures (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bi and Poo, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>) and acute slices (<a href=\"#bib11\">Edelmann and Lessmann, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yang and Dani, 2014</a>), where post-before-pre pairing protocols never elicited synaptic potentiation in baseline conditions. Given that DA has been found to widen the time window for the induction of t-LTP (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yang and Dani, 2014</a>), we wanted to assess whether endogenous DA could be responsible for the potentiation observed with the post-before-pre pairing under our experimental conditions. Therefore, we repeated this set of experiments using the post-before-pre pairing protocol with \u0394t = \u221210 ms in the presence of DA receptor (DAR) antagonists. Indeed, combined application of the D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (10 \u03bcM) and D2-like receptor antagonist sulpiride (50 \u03bcM) from the start of the recordings prevented t-LTP and enabled t-LTD instead (72 \u00b1 8%; <i>t</i>(5) = 3.6, p = 0.0160 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 6; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D,G</a>), rendering the STDP induction curve similar to that observed in hippocampal cultures (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bi and Poo, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). These results suggest a modulatory action of endogenous DA, presumably released during the pairing protocol (<a href=\"#bib13\">Frey et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yang and Dani, 2014</a>), which resulted in the changed polarity of plasticity at narrow negative spike-timing intervals."

To test this hypothesis experimentally, we applied DA <i>after</i> the t-LTD induction protocol. Exogenous DA (100 \u03bcM) added to the perfusion system for 10\u201312 min starting within 1 min after the post-before-pre pairing protocol with \u0394t = \u221220 ms converted t-LTD into t-LTP (169 \u00b1 16%, <i>t</i>(5) = 4.3, p = 0.0078 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 6; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). This implies that DA can have a retroactive effect allowing negative spike pairings to induce t-LTP. The specificity of this DAergic conversion of STDP was assessed using DAR antagonists. Indeed, combined application of DAR antagonists, SCH23390 (10 \u03bcM) and sulpiride (50 \u03bcM), prevented DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP, resulting in significant t-LTD instead (63 \u00b1 12%, <i>t</i>(5) = 3.0, p = 0.0289 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 6, \u0394t = \u221220 ms). Thus, the conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP was due to specific DAR activation. Importantly, when the test pathway was not stimulated following the pairing protocol until after DA washout (stimulation resumed 15 min after pairing), robust t-LTD was induced (61 \u00b1 5%, <i>t</i>(5) = 8.1, p = 0.0005 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 6; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). The effect of DA was, therefore, activity dependent, demonstrating that the reinforcing signal is capable of acting specifically on the active inputs. To exclude the possibility that DA by itself could potentiate the test pathway, control experiments with ongoing synaptic stimulation over 60 min at 0.2 Hz, but without pairing with postsynaptic action potentials, were performed. Consistent with earlier reports (<a href=\"#bib36\">Otmakhova and Lisman, 1999</a>), DA had no significant effect on the basal Schaffer-collateral transmission (110 \u00b1 7%, <i>t</i>(7) = 1.4, p = 0.2169 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 8; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>)."

Both hippocampal t-LTP and t-LTD (<a href=\"#bib11\">Edelmann and Lessmann, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yang and Dani, 2014</a>), as well as the modulation of STDP by DA (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>), require functional NMDA receptors. We, therefore, asked whether the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP is also NMDA receptor dependent. Application of the NMDA receptor antagonist <span class=\"small-caps\">d</span>-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (<span class=\"small-caps\">d</span>-AP5, 50 \u03bcM) after the post-before-pre pairing protocol did not by itself affect the development of t-LTD (57 \u00b1 12%, <i>t</i>(5) = 3.6, p = 0.0156 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 6, \u0394t = \u221220 ms; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,D</a>).

This suggests an important dissociation between two mechanisms involved in the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTD, namely a reversal of synaptic depression (de-depression) and synaptic potentiation, one of which is NMDA receptor dependent."

Sulpiride: 94 \u00b1 13%; <i>t</i>(6) = 3.2, p = 0.0228 vs DA (t-LTP); <i>t</i>(6) = 1.5, p = 0.1932 vs control (t-LTD); <i>t</i>(6) = 0.5, p = 0.6435 vs 100%; <i>n</i> = 7; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). This suggests that both receptor subtypes might mediate the retroactive effect of DA on STDP. Given the astounding complexity of D2-like receptor pharmacology (<a href=\"#bib32\">Neve et al., 2004</a>), we first wanted to evaluate the possible involvement of D1-like receptor-activated cAMP/PKA signaling cascade in the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP. D1/D5 receptor stimulation leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and subsequent increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) activation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Greengard et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Neve et al., 2004</a>). We found that the general AC activator, forskolin (50 \u03bcM), applied for 10\u201312 min immediately after the pairing protocol with \u0394t = \u221220 ms resulted in robust conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP (167 \u00b1 17%, <i>t</i>(6) = 3.9, p = 0.0078 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 7; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>). Notably, forskolin (50 \u03bcM) applied in the absence of the pairing protocol had no significant effect on baseline EPSPs (83 \u00b1 12%, <i>t</i>(6) = 1.4, p = 0.2046 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 7; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The forskolin-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP was also NMDA receptor dependent since bath application of <span class=\"small-caps\">d</span>-AP5 (50 \u03bcM) 1 min before forskolin treatment prevented synaptic potentiation from developing, although synaptic depression was reversed (102 \u00b1 11%, <i>t</i>(5) = 0.2, p = 0.8616 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 6; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>). This result suggests that the cAMP cascade works either upstream of or in parallel to NMDA receptor activation for the development of potentiation to occur. Downstream of cAMP, PKA is involved because the PKA inhibitor, H-89 (20 \u00b5M), blocked the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP, revealing significant t-LTD (76 \u00b1 5%, <i>t</i>(6) = 5.0, p = 0.0025 vs 100%, <i>n</i> = 7; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Taken together, these results imply that the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP involves activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade, which closely mimics the effects of DA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> vs <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Although, D2-like receptors are typically associated with the inhibition of AC (<a href=\"#bib32\">Neve et al., 2004</a>), interestingly, there is also evidence that D2-like receptor stimulation can potentiate AC activity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Glass and Felder, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Watts and Neve, 1997</a>). Therefore, while the possibility that D2-like receptors contribute to the conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP via a different signaling cascade cannot be excluded, it is tempting to suggest that the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP is mediated primarily via the cAMP/PKA pathway. Hence, based on our results, we propose that the stimulation of postsynaptic (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5ai</a>) or presynaptic (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5aii</a>) DARs activates the cAMP/PKA pathway, which\u2014via two cellular mechanisms (de-depression and potentiation)\u2014leads to the retroactive conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP."

On the other hand, hippocampal pyramidal cell assemblies are directly affected by concurrent activity in midbrain DAergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib29\">McNamara et al., 2014</a>), which have been linked to reward-seeking behavior (<a href=\"#bib40\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>) and appetitive stimuli (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fiorillo et al., 2013</a>).

This effect is mediated at least in part through the activation of the cAMP/PKA cascade and requires the activation of synaptic NMDA receptors. This in turn suggests that the conversion can only occur at synapses that are re-activated following the initial pairing event. Interestingly, it has been reported that hippocampal reactivation events (sharp wave ripples) increase in frequency following reward (<a href=\"#bib43\">Singer and Frank, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Atherton et al., 2015</a>). Thus, in behaving animals, the conditions for the conversion of depression into potentiation might occur during reward-related sharp wave ripple activity. Together, these findings support the concept of a slowly decaying synaptic <i>eligibility trace</i> that is committed to memory by the occurrence of reward and provide a possible mechanism for associating specific experiences with behaviorally distant, rewarding outcomes in animals (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sutton and Barto, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Suri and Schultz, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Izhikevich, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Harnett et al., 2009</a>), including humans (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dunsmoor et al., 2015</a>)."

However, major criticism was formulated in relation to the missing explanation on how the timing of bath-applied DA may relate to reward-based conditioning. The reviewers asked for diagrams describing the timing issues, in particular the possible linkages between the cAMP pathway and its relation to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling caused by action potentials and NMDAR activation. A stronger discussion of the data with existing literature is necessary. Moreover, one reviewer asked for additional experiments in which SCH23390 and sulpiride are separately applied. The reviewers were also curious for your thoughts about how the possible cAMP/PKA-mediated mechanism could be linked to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, NMDA receptor activation and finally the switch from LTD to LTP.
