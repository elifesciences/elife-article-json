Moreover, it has been suggested as a receptor mediating neurotoxicity in common neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as Alzheimer's disease. PrP<sup>C</sup> is shed at the plasma membrane by the metalloprotease ADAM10, yet the impact of this on prion disease remains enigmatic. Employing conditional knockout mice, we show that depletion of ADAM10 in forebrain neurons leads to posttranslational increase of PrP<sup>C</sup> levels. Upon prion infection of these mice, clinical, biochemical, and morphological data reveal that lack of ADAM10 significantly reduces incubation times and increases PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation. In contrast, spatiotemporal analysis indicates that absence of shedding impairs spread of prion pathology. Our data support a dual role for ADAM10-mediated shedding and highlight the role of proteolytic processing in prion disease."

Moreover, it has been suggested as a receptor mediating neurotoxicity in common neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as Alzheimer's disease. PrP<sup>C</sup> is shed at the plasma membrane by the metalloprotease ADAM10, yet the impact of this on prion disease remains enigmatic. Employing conditional knockout mice, we show that depletion of ADAM10 in forebrain neurons leads to posttranslational increase of PrP<sup>C</sup> levels. Upon prion infection of these mice, clinical, biochemical, and morphological data reveal that lack of ADAM10 significantly reduces incubation times and increases PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation. In contrast, spatiotemporal analysis indicates that absence of shedding impairs spread of prion pathology. Our data support a dual role for ADAM10-mediated shedding and highlight the role of proteolytic processing in prion disease."

These mice had a higher number of normal prion proteins on the surface of their neurons than normal mice did. When mice missing ADAM10 were infected with prions, more PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulated in their brain and disease symptoms developed sooner than when normal mice were infected. This supports the view that mice with higher numbers of prion proteins are more vulnerable to prion disease. However, disease symptoms did not spread as quickly to other parts of the brain in the mice missing ADAM10. This suggests that by releasing prion proteins from the surface of neurons, ADAM10 helps PrP<sup>Sc</sup> proteins to spread around the brain."

While \u03b1-cleavage, occurring in the middle of the PrP<sup>C</sup> sequence and producing a soluble N1 and a membrane-attached C1 fragment, confers neuroprotection with regard to prion diseases (<a href=\"#bib59\">Lewis et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Westergard et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Turnbaugh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Campbell et al., 2013</a>) and A\u03b2-associated neurotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib40\">Guillot-Sestier et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Resenberger et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Beland et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Guillot-Sestier et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Fluharty et al., 2013</a>), the role of an extreme C-terminal cleavage in close proximity to the plasma membrane, termed shedding, remains enigmatic. On the one hand, by reducing the substrate for prion conversion and the receptor for neurotoxicity, this proteolytic release of almost full length PrP<sup>C</sup> from the plasma membrane could be protective with regard to prion diseases (<a href=\"#bib67\">Marella et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Heiseke et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Altmeppen et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, recombinant or transgenically expressed anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> mimicking shed PrP<sup>C</sup> has been shown to antagonize both PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation and A\u03b2 neurotoxicity, respectively, thus indicating a protective activity by blocking toxic conformers and preventing their access to the cell (<a href=\"#bib70\">Meier et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Calella et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Nieznanski et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Fluharty et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Yuan et al., 2013</a>). On the other hand, shedding could accelerate an ongoing prion disease by increasing production and subsequent spread of anchorless prions within the CNS. In fact, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can be shed from the cellular surface in vitro (<a href=\"#bib96\">Taylor et al., 2009</a>) and anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> can, in principle, be converted to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, resulting in an altered type of prion disease in transgenic mice (<a href=\"#bib28\">Chesebro et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2010</a>). High expression of anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> leads to formation of prions and a late onset neurological disease (<a href=\"#bib94\">St\u00f6hr et al., 2011</a>)."

Using conditional <sup>Nestin</sup>ADAM10 knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib46\">Jorissen et al., 2010</a>), we recently showed that depletion of the protease in neural precursors abolishes shedding and leads to posttranslational accumulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> in the early secretory pathway indicative of a regulatory role of ADAM10 in PrP<sup>C</sup> membrane homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Altmeppen et al., 2011</a>). However, due to the perinatal lethality of these mice, the influence of ADAM10 on the course of prion disease remained unsolved. In this study we used novel viable ADAM10 conditional knockout (ADAM10 cKO or A10 cKO) mice with specific postnatal deletion of the protease in forebrain neurons (<a href=\"#bib83\">Prox et al., 2013</a>). We show that lack of ADAM10 leads to (i) elevated (membrane) levels of PrP<sup>C</sup>, (ii) drastically shortened incubation times of prion disease, (iii) increased prion conversion, and (iv) upregulation of calpain levels. In contrast, spread of prion-associated pathology within the brain was reduced. It is intriguing that the absence of a protease involved in the constitutive processing of PrP<sup>C</sup> significantly impacts the course of prion disease, thus enforcing the relevance of proteolytic processing events in neurodegeneration."

To further investigate this we generated neural stem cells (NSCs) from embryonic day (E) 14 wild-type and A10 cKO mice with inactivation of the <i>Adam10</i> gene in neuroectodermal progenitor cells (<sup>Nestin</sup>A10 KO mice) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Jorissen et al., 2010</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, surface biotinylation experiments on neuronally differentiated NSCs revealed that membrane levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> were increased 1.56-fold (\u00b10.12; SEM) in the absence of ADAM10 (n = 9 independent samples) compared with wild-type controls (set to 1 \u00b1 0.13; n = 9). Moreover, genetic reintroduction of <i>Adam10</i> into NSC cultures of <sup>Nestin</sup>A10 KO mice was sufficient to reduce membrane levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> (0.95 \u00b1 0.11; n = 8) and thus to restore physiological wild-type conditions. Nucleofection of <sup>Nestin</sup>A10 KO cells with a vector lacking the <i>Adam10</i> cDNA did not show any effect on PrP<sup>C</sup> membrane levels (1.55 \u00b1 0.18; n = 5). Indirect immunofluorescence analyses of non-permeabilized neuronally differentiated NSCs confirmed the biochemical results by showing increased intensity of PrP<sup>C</sup> surface immunostaining in <sup>Nestin</sup>A10 KO cells and <sup>Nestin</sup>A10 KO cells nucleofected with a control vector compared with wild-type control cells, and a similar intensity of PrP<sup>C</sup> surface immunostaining in A10-nucleofected <sup>Nestin</sup>A10 KO and control cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

                                "text": "Using conditional <sup>Nestin</sup>A10 knockout mice, we previously showed that lack of ADAM10-mediated shedding leads to increased neuronal levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Altmeppen et al., 2011</a>). However, due to the perinatal lethality of these mice we were unable to investigate the impact of ADAM10 deficiency on the course of prion disease. Therefore, new conditional <sup>Camk2a</sup>ADAM10 knockout mice (ADAM10 cKO or A10 cKO) lacking Adam10 in neurons of the forebrain were produced and characterized (<a href=\"#bib83\">Prox et al., 2013</a>). These mice were viable and used for prion inoculations performed in this study. First, we analyzed PrP<sup>C</sup> levels in A10 cKO and littermate controls at postnatal day (P) 19. Reduction of ADAM10 expression was accompanied by increased PrP<sup>C</sup> amounts as revealed by Western blot analysis of cortical homogenates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Residual ADAM10 most likely resulted from glial cells not depleted of ADAM10. In contrast to the cortex, differences in ADAM10 expression and PrP<sup>C</sup> levels between A10 cKO and littermate controls were not seen in the cerebellum, a brain region not affected by our knockout strategy (<a href=\"#bib24\">Casanova et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Prox et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Immunohistochemical analysis in P19 mouse brains confirmed the Western blot data by showing increased immunostaining for PrP<sup>C</sup> in A10 cKO mice in several regions of the forebrain, as exemplified by the hippocampus and cortex, whereas no such increase was observed in the cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In addition, a coronal brain section showing costaining of PrP<sup>C</sup> with the neuronal marker NeuN correlates with the <i>Camk2a</i> driven ADAM10 knockout strategy (<a href=\"#bib24\">Casanova et al., 2001</a>) by showing increased PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in hippocampal and cortical areas as well as in the striatum (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Increased PrP<sup>C</sup> levels in A10 cKO mice did not result from transcriptional upregulation as there were no significant differences in PrP<sup>C</sup> mRNA levels in the forebrain at P19 as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (mean \u00b1 SD: controls: 5.96 \u00b1 0.86; A10 cKO: 6.32 \u00b1 1.04; p = 0.23; n = 5) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We also analyzed PrP<sup>C</sup> levels in 35-week-old A10 cKO and littermate control mice. In contrast to newborn A10 cKO mice (<a href=\"#bib83\">Prox et al., 2013</a>), adult A10 cKO mice did not show differences regarding weight and body size (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Again, as shown at P19, adult A10 cKO mice also showed increased levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> in the cortex and hippocampus compared with their littermate controls, as assessed by immunohistochemistry at 35 weeks of age (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Taking these observations together, A10 cKO mice are viable and show a temporally unrestricted posttranslational increase of PrP<sup>C</sup> in neurons."

Since in A10 cKO mice levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> are posttranslationally increased, we also investigated this issue in <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> mice with genetically increased <i>Prnp</i> expression. To this aim, we performed Western blot analysis of total PrP (i.e., PrP<sup>C</sup> plus PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) and PK-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in A10 cKO and littermate control mice matched for days post prion inoculation (95 dpi) as well as in terminally prion-diseased <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> mice (65 dpi).

In order to control for this, we assessed neuropathological alterations at a matched time point (95 dpi) in both A10 cKO mice and littermate controls. Additionally, we included terminally prion-diseased <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> mice (65 dpi). In the striatum, typical neuropathological changes were seen in all groups of mice. Similar to hippocampus and cortex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), increased PrP<sup>Sc</sup> immunopositivity and astrogliosis were seen in A10 cKO mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>).

Thereby it affects (i) neurotoxicity, (ii) PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation, and (iii) spreading of prion pathology. (i) Lack of ADAM10 (as assessed here by use of A10 cKO mice) results in elevated PrP<sup>C</sup> membrane levels. Membrane levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> (as a receptor) likely determine PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-associated neurotoxicity (as indicated by sizes of thunderbolts and skulls) and thereby incubation times with shortest survival in <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> mice and reduced incubation times in A10 cKO mice compared with wild-type littermates with longest survival (order reflected by grey triangles on the left). (ii) Shed PrP, which is most efficiently produced in <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> and absent in A10 cKO mice, might block formation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. This is reflected by the different PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amounts found in our different experimental groups (A10 cKO &gt; wild-type littermates &gt; <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i>). The combination of increased PrP<sup>C</sup> membrane levels and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation in A10 cKO mice might favor increased production of membrane pores (as indicated in the middle row on the left) and neurotoxic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx with possible (\u2018?\u2019) involvement of calpain. (iii) Finally, spread of prion-associated pathology within the brain also seems to be affected by the levels of ADAM10 expression since <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> mice showed enhanced whereas A10 cKO mice showed reduced dissemination of neuropathological features (as indicated by size of arrowheads on the right). Key references supporting this model are given in the text. Based on this model, stimulation of ADAM10 might therefore offer a treatment option. With regard to incubation times, protective effects by reducing local membrane bound PrP<sup>C</sup> amounts and by producing a protective soluble fragment able to block PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation seem to predominate the disadvantage of increased spread by production of anchorless prions."

For \u03b1-cleavage, a protective role for both prion and AD is postulated and attributed to destruction of the neurotoxic domain and production of the neuroprotective N1 fragment respectively (<a href=\"#bib40\">Guillot-Sestier et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Resenberger et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Westergard et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Beland et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Guillot-Sestier et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Fluharty et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, the C1 fragment of PrP<sup>C</sup> is involved in myelination (<a href=\"#bib18\">Bremer et al., 2010</a>). The protective role of \u03b1-cleavage is also supported by the fact that \u03b1-cleavage-resistant PrP<sup>C</sup> deletion mutants are intrinsically neurotoxic upon expression in mice (<a href=\"#bib91\">Shmerling et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Baumann et al., 2007</a>) (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib107\">Yusa et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, our knowledge of the consequences of PrP<sup>C</sup> shedding, though being evolutionary conserved and constitutively occurring under physiological conditions, is limited. In a previous study we have shown that ADAM10 represents the principal PrP<sup>C</sup> sheddase in vivo with lack of ADAM10 resulting in a posttranslational increase of PrP<sup>C</sup> levels (<a href=\"#bib7\">Altmeppen et al., 2011</a>). This pointed to a key role for this protease in the regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> levels at the neuronal surface, yet its impact on prion diseases remained unknown. We recently generated A10 cKO mice, a viable model with selective postnatal ablation of ADAM10 in neurons of the forebrain (<a href=\"#bib83\">Prox et al., 2013</a>). In the present study we demonstrate that prion-inoculated A10 cKO mice show considerably reduced incubation times and increased conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. In contrast, spread of prion pathology within the brain is reduced, thus indicating a dual role for ADAM10 in the pathophysiology of prion disease (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

Once clinical symptoms appear, individual mice reliably succumb to disease within days. In contrast to peripheral prion inoculation where the integrity of the lymphoreticular or autonomous nervous system plays a decisive role in neuroinvasion of prions, incubation time after intracerebral inoculation is mainly influenced by PrP<sup>C</sup> levels (<a href=\"#bib64\">Mabbott et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Glatzel et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Prinz et al., 2003</a>). This is nicely exemplified by <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> mice constitutively overexpressing PrP<sup>C</sup> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Fischer et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Sandberg et al., 2011</a>). Our intracerebrally inoculated A10 cKO mice developed prion disease &gt;40 days earlier than controls, corresponding to a shortening of incubation times of \u223c30%. Such dramatic reductions upon intracerebral inoculation with high-dose RML prions have so far only been achieved when PrP<sup>C</sup> is massively overexpressed (<a href=\"#bib33\">Fischer et al., 1996</a>). Less dramatic reductions were, for instance, described in mice lacking superoxide dismutase 1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Akhtar et al., 2013</a>) or overexpressing the heat shock protein Hspa13 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Grizenkova et al., 2012</a>). The only other study investigating the role of ADAM10 in prion disease showed that transgenic overexpression of bovine ADAM10 in mice led to prolongation of prion disease (<a href=\"#bib31\">Endres et al., 2009</a>), a finding which is complementary to our data on the effect of ADAM10 deficiency. However, these authors linked this effect to transcriptional downregulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> and not to proteolytic processing events. In contrast, data from the present and previous studies show that transcriptional regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> is not affected by ADAM10 whereas proteolytic processing clearly is (<a href=\"#bib76\">Parkin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Taylor et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Altmeppen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Wik et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ostapchenko et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">McDonald et al., 2014</a>). We considered the possibility that non-PrP dependent effects resulting from ADAM10 deficiency may have contributed to disease acceleration. Indeed, ADAM10 is involved in a number of developmental and immunological processes and A10 cKO mice show learning deficits (<a href=\"#bib101\">Weber and Saftig, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Prox et al., 2013</a>). It is virtually impossible to dissect out the individual contribution of the multitude of ADAM10 targets to the pathophysiology of prion disease. For instance, microglia contribute to prion pathophysiology and express CD40L, a known ADAM10 substrate. Prion-inoculated CD40L-deficient mice show decreased incubation times (<a href=\"#bib21\">Burwinkel et al., 2004</a>). As CD40L is not expressed on neurons and its receptor (CD40) is not processed by ADAM10, we do not expect that this dyad is altered by our neuron-specific knockout strategy (<a href=\"#bib89\">Sch\u00f6nbeck and Libby, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Burwinkel et al., 2004</a>). Another microglia-related mechanism relevant to prion disease and influenced by ADAM10 is the Cx3cl1/Cx3cr1 signaling complex. The receptor (Cx3cr1) is expressed on microglia whereas its ligand Cx3cl1 (Fractalkine) is an ADAM10 substrate expressed on neurons. Cx3cl1-deficient mice inoculated with prions show slightly decreased incubation times to disease (<a href=\"#bib38\">Grizenkova et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, we do not assume that these events explain the strong effect observed in our study. Most other immune system-mediated effects on prion pathogenesis are only relevant for peripheral prion inoculation and neuroinvasion and do not play major roles in intracerebral prion administration (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aguzzi et al., 2003</a>). Furthermore, A10 cKO mice do not show any gross morphological abnormalities in the CNS, have a normal life span once they have survived a critical weaning period, and mock inoculated mice behave normally (<a href=\"#bib83\">Prox et al., 2013</a>). Finally, we consider that increased PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels found in A10 cKO mice strongly argue in favor of PrP-dependent effects of ADAM10 depletion."

This cannot be explained by the increased presence of PrP<sup>C</sup>, since PrP<sup>C</sup> overexpressing <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> mice showed low levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> even at the terminal stage of the disease. How can this be explained? The molecular basis underlying neurodegeneration in prion diseases is under debate and different mechanisms of neurotoxicity have been proposed. In the receptor model, PrP<sup>C</sup> binds oligomeric \u03b2-sheet rich protein species, such as PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, and mediates neurotoxic signaling (<a href=\"#bib71\">Mouillet-Richard et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Lauren et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Resenberger et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Larson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Um et al., 2012</a>). In the pore formation model, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> oligomers, either directly or upon binding to PrP<sup>C</sup>, form a membrane channel leading to exaggerated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and calpain activation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Falsig et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Sonati et al., 2013</a>). In our study we found evidence for the link between excessive generation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and increased calpain levels in A10 cKO mice, whereas basal (in littermate controls) and low (in <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> mice) PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels were not associated with calpain upregulation."

In fact, A10 cKO mice show prion-related pathology and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition at the site of (striatum) and adjacent to prion administration (hippocampus, frontal cortex, thalamus), whereas brain regions distant from the inoculation site (cerebellum, brain stem) were unaffected, even at terminal stages of disease. In contrast, in <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> mice, dissemination of prion-related pathology occurred efficiently at a much earlier time point. Non-PrP-dependent effects resulting from ADAM10 deficiency, such as altered microglial activity or reduced processing of proinflammatory molecules, may have contributed to impaired spreading (<a href=\"#bib102\">Weber et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Prox et al., 2013</a>). However, the influence of the immune system, including microglial activation on intracerebral spread of prions, is limited, therefore a correlation between PrP shedding and the efficiency of prion spread is possible (<a href=\"#bib35\">Glatzel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Grizenkova et al., 2014</a>). In line with our findings, it has been shown that, upon prion infection of mice, heterozygous expression of normal and anchorless PrP results in earlier death compared with wild-type mice (<a href=\"#bib28\">Chesebro et al., 2005</a>). Thus, shedding of either PrP<sup>C</sup> (followed by cell-free conversion [<a href=\"#bib50\">Kocisko et al., 1994</a>]) or PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, both of which have been shown to occur (<a href=\"#bib96\">Taylor et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Altmeppen et al., 2011</a>), should be considered as an alternative mechanism of prion spread (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) aside from direct transsynaptic cell-to-cell transfer (<a href=\"#bib36\">Glatzel et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Shearin and Bessen, 2014</a>), exosomal (<a href=\"#bib5\">Alais et al., 2008</a>) and viral transfer (<a href=\"#bib56\">Leblanc et al., 2006</a>), or tunneling nanotubes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Gousset et al., 2009</a>).

Interestingly, protective effects of ADAM10 might be hijacked in prion diseases since a reduction of the protease in prion disease has recently been reported in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib25\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). By contrast, shedding also seems to affect the spread of prion pathology within the CNS. Understanding this dual role of ADAM10 in prion disease brings together current concepts of prion biology and might reveal a mechanistic insight into important pathophysiological processes. Apart from prion disease, in other neurodegenerative proteinopathies, where PrP<sup>C</sup>-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion does not play a role, ADAM10-mediated shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> might solely be protective due to reduction of the receptor as well as the production of a soluble blocker of toxic oligomers. In view of a potential role of PrP<sup>C</sup> in AD, further research on proteolysis as a regulatory event in prion biology will likely impact on more common neurodegenerative conditions."

This interpretation may be valid, but ADAM10 deficiency is highly pathogenic by itself, and the authors say that they couldn't even perform the experiment in CNS-specific conditional mutants because of embryonic lethality. It is therefore plausible (and indeed likely) that the accelerated death of prion-inoculated A10 cKO mice results nonspecifically from the combined pathology of prion infection plus absence of ADAM10. This possibility is rendered even more likely by the titer determinations which failed to demonstrate any difference in prion replication between A10 cKO and wt mice. The above is not necessarily a killer of this well-conducted study, but these alternative interpretations must by all means be discussed."

The authors have not directly investigated whether prion spread is modified in their mice (an admittedly difficult task, though not impossible). A knockout of ADAM10 in the <i>tga20</i> mice would allow investigating more precisely the role of cleaved PrP<sup>C</sup> in the spreading of the disease in these mice. It might also be possible to inject /transduce /transgenically express soluble PrP<sup>C</sup> in the ADAM10 cKO and rescue the spreading of the disease. As these experiments require substantial time, the authors might alternatively reconsider this conclusion and either tone down the interpretation of these findings, or at least mention the many possible alternative explanations."

I believe that these data should be summarized in one figure, especially because this is not entirely novel. Moreover, instead of many different data it is better to have a couple of experiments fully documented. For instance it is not clear what was quantified in Figure Panel 1A and this should be complemented with the blot or the figure on which the quantitation is based. Panel 1C should include for the ADAM10 KO a similar analysis as for the control with regard to PrP surface staining. In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>: the immunohistochemistry shows a particular strong staining in the mouse brains of the ADAM cKO, more than what is seen in the western blot and expression is very diffuse over all cells (while the ko is only in a subset of neurons). Additional controls e.g. immunostaining of the cerebellum and more precise details of the cellular stainings would help to understand this better and to demonstrate for instance that the slides of wild type and knock out were incubated for similar length of time. It is also important to show that PrP accumulation is only seen in the neurons where ADAM10 was knocked out, as this is an important point also with regard to the conclusions with regard to the propagation of the disease."

This interpretation may be valid, but ADAM10 deficiency is highly pathogenic by itself, and the authors say that they couldn't even perform the experiment in CNS-specific conditional mutants because of embryonic lethality. It is therefore plausible (and indeed likely) that the accelerated death of prion-inoculated A10 cKO mice results nonspecifically from the combined pathology of prion infection plus absence of ADAM10. This possibility is rendered even more likely by the titer determinations which failed to demonstrate any difference in prion replication between A10 cKO and wt mice.

Finally, to the best of our knowledge there is no published reliable antibody against ADAM10 working in immnunohistochemical staining of mouse brain sections. We have nevertheless tried different ADAM10 antibodies (rabbit anti-ADAM10 (B42.1); rabbit anti-ADAM10 amino acids 608-627 (kindly provided by Dr. A. Chalaris, Kiel); rat anti-ADAM10 ectodomain antibody (MAB946)) under different staining conditions in formalin-fixed and cryo-fixed brain samples yet were not able to detect specific signals. Thus, we could not perform co-stainings of ADAM10 and PrP<sup>C</sup> which would help to answer this point of the reviewer."

Thus, while we think that PrP<sup>C</sup> membrane levels are decisive for prion-associated neurotoxicity and disease duration (with <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> showing much shorter incubation times than ADAM10 cKO mice), elevated total as well as surface levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> (<i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> &gt; ADAM10 cKO &gt; wild-type controls) do not explain the differences in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation. In fact, we think that shed PrP<sup>C</sup> inhibits the conversion to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in vivo. As discussed in the main text (Discussion section) there is also some evidence from other studies showing that anchorless versions of PrP<sup>C</sup> act as antagonists of the conversion process. We also added a reference showing this inhibitory effect in PMCA approaches (<a href=\"#bib49\">Kim et al., 2009</a>). Soluble PrP<sup>C</sup> generated by ADAM10-mediated shedding could represent the physiological correlate of this. We speculate that lack of the protease is responsible for efficient PrP<sup>Sc</sup> production in ADAM10 cKO mice whereas increased production of shed PrP<sup>C</sup> in <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> mice (partially) explains their poor conversion rate (a known phenomenon of the latter mouse model that, to our knowledge, has not been solved to date). Fitting to this concept, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> production was decreased in mice moderately overexpressing ADAM10 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Endres et al., 2009</a>). We have newly added this reference in this context in the main text (paragraph six of the Discussion section). As mentioned in our response to the reviewing editor (major point 2) we agree that the crossing of ADAM10 cKO and <i>tg</i>a<i>20</i> mice is an interesting experiment to gain deeper insight."

The mere detection of calpains by Western blot is irrelevant. The whole argument about calpains needs to be revisited by activity measurements, or else it should be deleted in toto.
