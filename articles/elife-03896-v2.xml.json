Cocultures of <i>Aplysia</i> sensory and motor neurons were trained with spaced pulses of serotonin, which induces long-term facilitation. Serotonin (5HT) triggered growth of new presynaptic varicosities, a synaptic mechanism of long-term sensitization. Following 5HT training, two antimnemonic treatments\u2014reconsolidation blockade and inhibition of PKM\u2014caused the number of presynaptic varicosities to revert to the original, pretraining value. Surprisingly, the final synaptic structure was not achieved by targeted retraction of the 5HT-induced varicosities but, rather, by an apparently arbitrary retraction of both 5HT-induced and original synapses. In addition, we find evidence that the LTM for sensitization persists covertly after its apparent elimination by the same antimnemonic treatments that erase learning-related synaptic growth. These results challenge the idea that stable synapses store long-term memories."

Cocultures of <i>Aplysia</i> sensory and motor neurons were trained with spaced pulses of serotonin, which induces long-term facilitation. Serotonin (5HT) triggered growth of new presynaptic varicosities, a synaptic mechanism of long-term sensitization. Following 5HT training, two antimnemonic treatments\u2014reconsolidation blockade and inhibition of PKM\u2014caused the number of presynaptic varicosities to revert to the original, pretraining value. Surprisingly, the final synaptic structure was not achieved by targeted retraction of the 5HT-induced varicosities but, rather, by an apparently arbitrary retraction of both 5HT-induced and original synapses. In addition, we find evidence that the LTM for sensitization persists covertly after its apparent elimination by the same antimnemonic treatments that erase learning-related synaptic growth. These results challenge the idea that stable synapses store long-term memories."

A corollary of this idea, accepted by many, if not most, modern neuroscientists, is that memories are maintained by persistent molecular and cellular alterations in synaptic structures themselves (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bailey and Kandel, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kandel et al., 2014</a>). Here, we have tested the idea that long-term memory (LTM) is stored at synapses using the marine mollusk <i>Aplysia californica</i>. The relatively simple behavior and nervous system of this model invertebrate organism offer several major advantages for understanding memory at the level of modifications of individual synapses (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kandel, 2001</a>). A form of learning in <i>Aplysia</i> whose cellular and molecular substrates are particularly well understood is sensitization of the gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex (<a href=\"#bib16\">Carew et al., 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Brunelli et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Antonov et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kandel, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Glanzman, 2010</a>). Sensitization of the withdrawal reflex exhibits a long-term (\u226524 hr) form (<a href=\"#bib61\">Pinsker et al., 1973</a>) due, in part, to long-term facilitation (LTF) of the monosynaptic connection between the sensory and motor neurons that mediate the reflex (<a href=\"#bib21\">Frost et al., 1985</a>). Importantly, the monosynaptic sensorimotor connection can be reconstituted in dissociated cell culture, and LTF of the in vitro synapse can be induced by training with pulses of serotonin (5HT), the monoaminergic neurotransmitter that mediates sensitization in <i>Aplysia</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brunelli et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Glanzman et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Marinesco and Carew, 2002</a>). Cellular and molecular analyses of this form of long-term synaptic plasticity have provided major mechanistic insights into long-term memory in <i>Aplysia</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Goelet et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dash et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bartsch et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Martin et al., 1997</a>), insights that have generalized to learning and memory in other organisms, including mammals (<a href=\"#bib81\">Yin et al., 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib80\">1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Frey and Morris, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kogan et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Josselyn et al., 2001</a>). Accordingly, we used the in vitro sensorimotor synapse in initial experiments to determine whether LTM is stored at synapses."

One of these goes under the rubric of reconsolidation blockade. Here, a stimulus is delivered to an animal that serves to reactivate the LTM for a previous learning experience. If, immediately after delivery of this reminder, the animal is treated with an inhibitor of protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib59\">Nader et al., 2000</a>), or subjected to electroconvulsive shock (<a href=\"#bib56\">Misanin et al., 1968</a>), the LTM will be apparently eliminated. Based on this evidence, it has been proposed that the reminder stimulus returns the LTM to a labile state in which new protein synthesis is required to reconsolidate the memory; and that inhibition of protein synthesis during this period of reconsolidation can erase the original memory (<a href=\"#bib58\">Nader and Hardt, 2009</a>) (but see <a href=\"#bib43\">Lattal and Abel, 2004</a>). Another manipulation that can apparently erase LTM permanently is inhibition of the constitutively active catalytic fragment of the atypical protein kinase C\u03b6; the ongoing activity of this catalytic fragment, named PKM\u03b6, appears to be required for the maintenance of several forms of LTM in mammals (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sacktor, 2011</a>); inhibition of PKM\u03b6, in the absence of a reminder, has been reported to abolish consolidated memory (but see <a href=\"#bib44\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Volk et al., 2013</a>)."

LTF is mediated partly by the growth of new sensory neuron varicosities (<a href=\"#bib25\">Glanzman et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bailey and Kandel, 2008</a>). Here we investigated whether blocking the reconsolidation of the memory for LTF, or inhibiting PKM Apl III, altered this long-term change in presynaptic structure. We found that the synaptic growth induced by LTF training was reversed by these two memory-disrupting manipulations; however, although the overall number of presynaptic varicosities reverted to the original, pretraining level, the resultant morphological pattern of sensorimotor synapses differed significantly from the original one.

Immediately following the reminder pulse of 5HT, one group (5X5HT-1X5HT-Aniso group) received anisomycin (10 \u00b5M) treatment for 2 hr. Two other groups of 5X5HT-trained cocultures did not get the reminder pulse of 5HT; one of these groups (5X5HT-Aniso) received the anisomycin treatment, whereas the other group (5X5HT) received vehicle solution instead. A final group of cocultures (Controls) did not receive either 5HT or anisomycin; instead, the Controls were treated with vehicle solution at the experimental times that the 5X5HT training and anisomycin treatment were administered to other groups. At 48 hr after the original imaging session all of the cocultures were imaged and the varicosities once more quantified."

The varicosities were put into one of three categories: \u2018original\u2019 varicosities, that is, the varicosities present at 0 hr; \u20185HT-induced\u2019 varicosities, the varicosities that appeared during the 24 hr after 5HT treatment (this category pertained only to the groups given 5X5HT training); and \u2018new\u2019 varicosities, varicosities formed during the 24\u201348 hr period. For the analysis of varicosity fate the three groups of cocultures that received the 5X5HT training without reconsolidation blockade\u2014that is, the 5X5HT, 5X5HT-1X5HT and 5X5HT-Aniso groups\u2014were consolidated into a single group labeled \u20185HT-No reconsolidation/No blockade\u2019 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. Inspection of the fates of individual varicosities in this group yielded surprising results. First, many of the 5HT-induced SN varicosities in the 5HT-No reconsolidation/No blockade group did not persist until the final imaging session (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A and 3A</a>); instead, there was significant retraction of the 5HT-induced varicosities between 24 and 48 hr in this group. Second, there was also retraction of the original varicosities during this period (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B and 3A</a>). Varicosities in the 5X5HT-1X5HT-Aniso group\u2014the group of trained cocultures subjected to reconsolidation blockade\u2014exhibited a similar pattern of retraction of 5HT-induced and original varicosities, but the amount of retraction was significantly greater than that observed in the 5HT-No reconsolidation/No blockade cocultures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A,B and 3B</a>). A third unexpected finding was the substantial growth of new varicosities in all trained groups between 24 and 48 hr; the amount of the growth was significantly greater, however, in the 5-HT-No reconsolidation/No blockade cocultures than in the 5X5HT-1X5HT-Aniso group (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Thus, the 5X5HT trained cocultures subjected to reconsolidation blockade exhibited significantly more retraction and significantly less growth of varicosities during the 24\u201348 hr period than did the other trained cocultures. Interestingly, whereas there was greater retraction of 5HT-induced varicosities than of original varicosities between 24\u201348 hr in the 5HT-No reconsolidation/No blockade group, the retraction of 5HT-induced varicosities and original varicosities did not differ in the 5X5HT-1X5HT-Aniso group (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Our morphological data reveal the operation of a heretofore unrecognized homeostatic mechanism that adjusts the number of SN varicosities\u2014and, presumably, active synaptic sites (<a href=\"#bib67\">Schacher et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kim et al., 2003</a>)\u2014for sensorimotor connections according to their learning-related experience, but that seems unconcerned with the identities of the individual varicosities/synaptic sites. In the 5HT-No reconsolidation/No blockade cocultures the significant retraction of SN varicosities during 24\u201348 hr after 5X5HT training was compensated for by significant growth of new varicosities, so that the overall number remained constant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C and 2</a>). By contrast, the number of varicosities was reset to the original (0 hr) value in the 5X5HT-1X5T-Aniso group; this resetting involved increased retraction of both 5HT-induced and original varicosities, and decreased growth of new varicosities between 24 and 48 hr. Consequently, the morphological state of the cocultures in the 5X5HT-1X5T-Aniso group at 48 hr differed significantly from that at 0 hr with respect to the identities of individual SN varicosities."

PKM Apl III, a homolog of mammalian PKM\u03b6 (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sacktor, 2011</a>), is formed from the atypical <i>Aplysia</i> protein kinase C (PKC Apl III) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bougie et al., 2009</a>) by calpain-dependent cleavage; furthermore, this cleavage is induced by prolonged treatment with 5HT (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bougie et al., 2012</a>). In previous behavioral and electrophysiological investigations we found that inhibition of PKM Apl III, either with the pseudosubstrate sequence of the regulatory domain of atypical PKC (ZIP) or with chelerythrine, a PKC inhibitor selective for PKM at low concentrations (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ling et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Villareal et al., 2009</a>), abolished both consolidated long-term sensitization and LTF (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cai et al., 2011</a>). To determine whether inhibition of PKM Apl III reverses the structural growth that mediates long-term sensitization (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bailey and Chen, 1983</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">1988</a>) and LTF (<a href=\"#bib25\">Glanzman et al., 1990</a>), we gave some cocultures (5X5HT-Chel group) 5X5HT training followed 24 hr later by treatment with chelerythrine (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Another group of cocultures (5X5HT group) received the 5X5HT training alone. Finally, a third group (Controls) received the vehicle solution instead of either 5HT or chelerythrine. The SNs and MNs of all of the cocultures were labeled with fluorescent dye as before and then imaged on Day 1 (0 hr) of the experiment. Immediately afterwards cocultures in the 5X5HT and 5X5HT-Chel groups were given 5X5HT training. All cocultures were imaged for a second time at 24 hr, after which cocultures in the 5X5HT-Chel group received chelerythrine (10 \u00b5M, 1 hr), while the other two groups received the vehicle solution. (The 5X5HT-Chel group did not receive 1X5HT prior to chelerythrine treatment.) The cocultures were imaged for a final time at 48 hr."

This net increase persisted in the 5X5HT group, but was reversed in 5X5HT-Chel group at 48 hr. Monitoring of the fate of individual varicosities in the 5X5HT group revealed the same pattern of structural growth and retraction observed previously in the 5X5HT-trained cocultures not subjected to reconsolidation blockade. Specifically, some varicosities induced by the 5X5HT training were lost between 24 and 48 hr, as were some of the original varicosities; this loss, however, was compensated for by the growth of new varicosities; consequently, the overall varicosity number remained stably elevated during the 24\u201348 hr period (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C and 5</a>). The varicosities in the 5X5HT-Chel group exhibited significantly greater retraction and significantly less growth between 24 and 48 hr than those in the 5X5HT group, resulting in an overall loss of varicosities. Thus, the number of varicosities in the 5X5HT-Chel group at 48 hr was returned to the value at 0 hr. This result indicates that inhibiting PKM Apl III, like reconsolidation blockade (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), engages a homeostatic mechanism that resets the presynaptic varicosities in sensorimotor cocultures to the number present prior to training. Another similarity between the morphological effects of reconsolidation blockade and inhibition of PKM was that there was equal retraction of 5HT-induced and original varicosities in the 5X5HT-Chel cocultures during 24\u201348 hr, whereas, as before, the retraction of 5HT-induced varicosities was greater in the 5X5HT cocultures during this period (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Possibly, LTM, or the primer for LTM, resides in the nuclei of neurons within the SWR circuitry, encoded as epigenetic changes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Levenson and Sweatt, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rahn et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Graff and Tsai, 2013a</a>). To investigate this possibility, we tested whether chelerythrine's apparent disruption of LTM involves alterations of chromatin structure. For this test we used the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Graff and Tsai, 2013b</a>). <i>Aplysia</i> were given five bouts of tail shocks, and the strength of the SWR was tested 24 hr later (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Immediately after this test the sensitization-trained animals received an intrahemocoel injection of the vehicle solution alone or TSA; 10\u201315 min later some of the animals treated with TSA were given an injection of chelerythrine (5XTrained-TSA-Chel group). (Untrained control animals received an injection of the vehicle solution after the 24 hr test.) In addition, another group of trained animals were given the chelerythrine without a prior injection of TSA (5XTrained-Chel group). All animals were retested at 48 hr. TSA treatment blocked the disruption of LTS by chelerythrine (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). The injection of TSA 24 hr after training by itself did not alter LTS (5XTrained-TSA group).

Rather, LTM appears to be regulated by a homeostatic mechanism that specifies the net synaptic strength according to experience. Following 5X5HT stimulation, we observed that the number of presynaptic varicosities in the sensorimotor cocultures increased to a new overall value, and that this value was maintained despite the appearance and disappearance of individual varicosities. Furthermore, blockade of memory reconsolidation, or inhibition of PKM, reset the number of varicosities to the original, non-facilitated value. Remarkably, this resetting did not result from the straightforward retraction of the varicosities that appeared by 24 hr after 5X5HT stimulation, varicosities whose growth coincides with LTF (<a href=\"#bib25\">Glanzman et al., 1990</a>); rather, the resetting was produced by a complex reorganization that involved retraction of both 5HT-induced and original varicosities, as well as growth of new, additional varicosities. Thus, for any given sensorimotor connection, the homeostatic regulatory mechanism appeared indifferent to the identities of the particular presynaptic varicosities and, presumably, active zones (<a href=\"#bib67\">Schacher et al., 1990</a>), that mediated baseline synaptic transmission and synaptic facilitation. Our data argue that synapses are not \u2018tagged\u2019 with respect to memory storage, at least for a connection involving a single SN and a single MN; the data may therefore reflect a fundamental distinction between the cellular and molecular processes of LTM storage and those of LTM induction in <i>Aplysia</i>, in which synaptic tagging plays a critical role (<a href=\"#bib52\">Martin et al., 1997</a>). The data also suggest that synaptic change is an expression mechanism, rather than a storage mechanism, for LTM in <i>Aplysia</i> (although see below)."

This result provides additional evidence for the operation of a homeostatic regulatory mechanism, and suggests that the homeostatic mechanism toggles between two all-or-none states, a facilitated, sensitization-related state and a nonfacilitated one. (There must also be a third state, synaptic depression, in which the strength of the sensorimotor connection is reduced below the nonfacilitated level [<a href=\"#bib57\">Montarolo et al., 1988</a>].)

But other studies of the mouse brain using very similar in vivo imaging techniques have reported a high degree of spine instability in the adult cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#bib72\">Trachtenberg et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Holtmaat et al., 2005</a>); the contradiction between these two sets of opposed findings remains unresolved. Furthermore, even in those studies where spines of adult cortical neurons were reported to be highly stable, there was significant instability of both pre-existing and new spines within the first 2\u20134 days after a training protocol (<a href=\"#bib78\">Xu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Yang et al., 2009</a>), and we monitored SN varicosities for only 48 hr after training with 5HT. Therefore, the present results are not necessarily inconsistent with those from in vivo imaging studies in the mouse brain."

This finding is consistent with two possible explanations. First, the LTM for sensitization may be intact in animals following reconsolidation blockade and inhibition of PKM, despite the elimination of both behavioral enhancement and synaptic growth. According to this scheme, synapses serve merely to express LTM, they are not sites of LTM storage. The reinstatement of LTM expression, then, involves restoring the appropriate number of synapses between the SNs and MNs, as determined by an experience-registering homeostatic mechanism. The second possible explanation incorporates the notion of an as-yet-unidentified priming mechanism; here, reconsolidation blockade and inhibition of PKM, can erase the stored sensitization memory through the reversal of pre- and postsynaptic structures induced by the long-term training, but the antimnemonic treatments do not eliminate the primer. The primer does not constitute LTM, but is required for its reconstitution via new synaptic growth. The priming signal might interact with fresh facilitatory input to the withdrawal circuit, due to the additional (3\u00d7) tail shocks, to upregulate the number of synaptic contacts; the appropriate number of contacts could be determined by the homeostatic process, and involve signals from existing and new synapses."

Data from an in vitro study of LTF have also implicated histone acetylation in LTM in <i>Aplysia</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Guan et al., 2002</a>). How might HDAC inhibition block chelerythrine's apparent disruption of LTM? Possibly, TSA, by inhibiting histone deacetylase, activates the transcription of genes that promote LTM; the activation of these genes, in turn, may compensate for a disruptive action of chelerythrine on LTM. Findings by others are consistent with this idea. Thus, treatment with an HDAC inhibitor rescues cognitive deficits and learning-related synaptic plasticity in mice that are heterozygous for a mutant form of CREB binding protein (CBP) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alarcon et al., 2004</a>). In addition, it has been found that phosphorylation of CBP by the atypical PKC\u03b6 is required for the histone acetylation that promotes the differentiation of developing neural precursors into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes; mutant mice haploinsufficient for CBP exhibit abnormal development of the cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, chelerythrine, by inhibiting the phosphorylation of CBP by PKC\u03b6, blocks the differentiation of cultured precursor cells into astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). A recent study in <i>Aplysia</i> has found that reducing the activity of CBP in SNs through intracellular injection of CBP small interfering RNA (siRNA) impaired the induction of LTF in sensorimotor cocultures (<a href=\"#bib50\">Liu et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, this deficit in LTF induction could be rescued through the use of a 5HT training protocol designed to maximize the phosphorylation and synthesis of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP). Taken together, these studies suggest that chelerythrine can disrupt epigenetic processes, possibly involving histone acetylation stimulated by CBP, that promote the induction and maintenance of LTM. Moreover, because HDAC inhibition can block chelerythrine's deleterious effects on memory, as well as promote the induction of LTM, it is intriguing to speculate that these effects might be due to enhancement of a CBP-dependent pathway."

                        "text": "But the above explanation for why TSA blocks chelerythrine's effect on consolidated LTM raises a critical question. Our data suggest that consolidated LTM persists after chelerythrine treatment (as well as reconsolidation blockade), possibly as nuclear changes. If so, then the molecular basis for the persistence of LTM is unlikely to be histone acetylation, because an apparent action of chelerythrine is to reverse histone acetylation. Another prominent epigenetic mechanism known to play a role in LTM is DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Day and Sweatt, 2010</a>). Although early evidence indicated that learning-induced DNA methylation in the hippocampus was transient and readily reversible (<a href=\"#bib55\">Miller and Sweatt, 2007</a>), a more recent study has reported that contextual fear conditioning in rats induces DNA methylation of the gene for calcineurin in cortical neurons that persists for at least a month (<a href=\"#bib54\">Miller et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, Sweatt and colleagues have shown in a rat model of childhood maltreatment that early trauma can produce changes in the DNA methylation of the gene for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the cortex, changes that persist into adulthood (<a href=\"#bib65\">Roth et al., 2009</a>). Thus, DNA methylation may constitute an epigenetic mechanism for the lifelong storage of memory (<a href=\"#bib19\">Day and Sweatt, 2010</a>). Interestingly, 5HT has recently been reported to induce DNA methylation of the promoter of the transcriptional repressor of memory CREB2, thereby facilitating the induction of LTF (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rajasethupathy et al., 2012</a>). Finally, another potential candidate for a nuclear mechanism of LTM storage is suggested by a recent study by <a href=\"#bib71\">Suberbielle et al. (2013)</a> that found, remarkably, that learning causes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in neurons in the brains of control mice; thus, chromatin remodeling subsequent to DNA DSBs may also encode LTM."

An obvious difficulty confronting any hypothetical nuclear storage mechanism in the mammalian brain is how the appropriate number of connections can be maintained in a synapse-specific manner after learning has occurred. For example, if a synaptic contact that has undergone Hebbian long-term potentiation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bliss and Collingridge, 1993</a>) as a consequence of associative learning retracts, how could a nuclear storage mechanism restrict the growth of a replacement contact to the correct pair of pre- and postsynaptic neurons?

Our experience (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cai et al., 2011</a>, and the present results) suggests that the failure to reinstate conditioned taste aversion in this study was not because LTM had been extinguished, but because a single application of the UCS was too weak to reverse the disruptive effects of ZIP on mechanisms of LTM expression, some of which may involve chromatin remodeling (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>)."

Animals were housed in a 50 gal aquarium filled with cooled (12\u201314\u00b0C), aerated seawater (Catalina Water Company, Long Beach, CA, USA). The behavioral training and testing methods were similar to those previously described (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fulton et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cai et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2012</a>). Three pretests were performed at once per 10 min, beginning 25 min before the start of training. Full sensitization training consisted of five bouts of electrical shocks delivered to the tail at 20-min intervals. During each bout, the animal received three trains of shocks spaced 2 s apart. Each train was 1 s in duration; the shocks (10-ms pulse duration, 40 Hz, 120 V) were delivered via a Grass stimulator (S88, Astro-Med, West Warwick, RI) connected to platinum wires implanted in the tail. After training the animals were given posttests as indicated in the figures."

Anisomycin was then diluted in ASW to a concentration of 20 mM (50% DMSO). 200 \u03bcl per 100 g of body weight of anisomycin was injected into the animals. Injections of the same amount of vehicle solution (DMSO in ASW) were made in Control experiments. The final concentrations of anisomycin in the animal were approximately 40 \u03bcM. The final concentration of DMSO in the hemocoel was \u223c0.1%. A volume of 200 \u03bcl per 100 g of body weight of chelerythrine was injected into the animals. Trichostatin A (TSA) (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 10 mM to make a stock solution. To inhibit the histone deacetylase, a volume of 100 \u03bcl per 100 g of body weight of TSA was injected into the animals. The specific times at which the intrahemocoel injections were made are indicated in the relevant figures."

For each coculture the number of varicosities counted at 24 hr and 48 hr after 5HT training were normalized as described in the figure legends. The normalized data were expressed as means \u00b1SEM. For the analysis of the data involving monitoring of synapses/behavior over time, the overall data were first assessed with repeated-measures two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA). If the repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant interaction, one-way ANOVAs were performed on the separate test times, followed by Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) posthoc tests for pairwise comparisons. An unpaired Student's <i>t</i>-test was used to determine the statistical significance of the differences when there were only two groups in the data set (data in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2,5,6 and 9D</a>). All reported levels of significance represent two-tailed values unless otherwise indicated."

This is particularly true when the apparent deacetylation of histones triggered by chelerythrine does not compromise the covert persistent memory. Logically, this means that the residual memory that persists after PKC inhibition and which can be fully restored (or unmasked) with 3 more training trials, cannot be mediated by histone acetylation. This is an important point of confusion in the authors' analysis. Although they wish to assign a role for histone acetylation in the \u201csynapse-independent\u201d memory mechanism, their evidence actually suggests that there is an additional mechanism of memory beyond the PKC-dependent memory, the erasure of which is blocked by TSA. This issue should be more objectively and critically discussed."

The authors should acknowledge that it is possible that the original sequence of 5-HT exposures primes the synapses for plasticity even after a memory is erased. There is a substantial number of experimental results suggesting priming, both at the synaptic and the behavioral levels (e.g. <a href=\"#bib33\">Hegde et al, 1993, 1997</a>). The Barco et al (2002, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) result with constitutively active CREB suggests changes in gene expression can subsequently interact with local synaptic signals to initiate synaptic plasticity. Even the Guan et al. result with an HDAC inhibitor that enables a single pulse of 5-HT to initiate long-term facilitation suggests there synapses can be primed for long-term plasticity. Thus, early training can induce molecular changes (e.g. transcription of an IEG or translocation to the nucleus) but subsequent training may be required to induce the change in synaptic strength or behavior. These priming mechanisms are considered to be molecular explanations for the importance of repeated training trials. If the Chen-Glanzman phenomenon worked similarly, there could be a persistent change that primes cells to respond to subsequent training trials. Histone acetylation could be one such change, though the TSA data are not consistent with this possibility. A change in an ubiquitination-proteasome protein or in a kinase or phosphatase are examples of non-genomic persistent changes that could contribute. Seen from this perspective, the synaptic changes would be part of the memory, but there are cell wide changes that would be more persistent. This is a less paradoxical suggestion, but one that could be equally interesting. It has the advantage of preserving the possibility of synapse specific plasticity contributing to learning. The authors should acknowledge and discuss these possibilities."

There seems to be a set point for net synaptic strength, although this set point may shift during long-term synaptic plasticity (much as Hu and colleagues have described.) That the overall strength of synaptic connections may be kept stable while individual synaptic connections form or are retracted does not necessarily mean that synapses don't \u201cstore memory.\u201d Instead, it suggests the possibility that there is a mechanism to set global synaptic strength, much as suggested by numerous studies of homeostatic synaptic scaling. The concept of a set point that shifts with sensitization should be discussed more explicitly."

All molecular participants in memory storage interact with a wide array of other molecules in complex networks. We know from studies such as Casadio et al. (1999) and Barco et al. (2002) that changes in transcription interact with local synaptic \u201ctags\u201d to initiate long-term alterations in synaptic strength. Indeed, the emergent conclusion over nearly two decades is that neither the transcriptional changes nor local synaptic changes are sufficient to represent long-term memory. The authors suggest that synapses merely express memory that is \u201cstored\u201d at the genome level. However, they present no evidence that the homeostatic set point is specified solely in the genome (or even the transcriptome), rather than emerging from a dynamic process in which synaptic sites participate interactively in storing the memory. To consider a crude analogy, this is a bit like positing that muscle strength is specified in muscle fiber nuclei, rather than through complex dynamic interactions among gene expression, cytoskeletal elements, signaling molecules and extracellular matrix, and also non-muscle cells, simply because individual myosin or actin filaments turn over."

This result requires reevaluation of the long-argued model that persistent activity of PKM is required for memory because it supports enhanced synaptic strength at individual local synaptic sites. Even with this one data set, these results might have a larger impact in a separate short publication, rather than tacked on at the end of the present study. This perspective is partially supported by the authors' conclusions, which rather trivialize this important finding. (For example in the Abstract, it is stated: \u201cwe provide evidence that LTM in Aplysia is stored by epigenetic changes\u201d and nearly identical summary statements appear at the end of the Introduction and in the Discussion.) We have known for more than a decade in both Aplysia and mammalian CNS that histone acetylation is critical for long-term synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. What is novel here is that atypical PKC activity appears to be required for the persistence of the histone acetylation-dependent effect, possibly by suppressing histone deactylase activity."

This is an important point of confusion in the authors' analysis. Although they wish to assign a role for histone acetylation in the \u201csynapse-independent\u201d memory mechanism, their evidence actually suggests that there is an additional mechanism of memory beyond the PKC-dependent memory, the erasure of which is blocked by TSA.

Even the Guan et al. result with an HDAC inhibitor that enables a single pulse of 5-HT to initiate long-term facilitation suggests there synapses can be primed for long-term plasticity. Thus, early training can induce molecular changes (e.g. transcription of an IEG or translocation to the nucleus) but subsequent training may be required to induce the change in synaptic strength or behavior. These priming mechanisms are considered to be molecular explanations for the importance of repeated training trials. If the Chen-Glanzman phenomenon worked similarly, there could be a persistent change that primes cells to respond to subsequent training trials. Histone acetylation could be one such change, though the TSA data are not consistent with this possibility. A change in an ubiquitination-proteasome protein or in a kinase or phosphatase are examples of non-genomic persistent changes that could contribute. Seen from this perspective, the synaptic changes would be part of the memory, but there are cell wide changes that would be more persistent. This is a less paradoxical suggestion, but one that could be equally interesting. It has the advantage of preserving the possibility of synapse specific plasticity contributing to learning.

The notion of synaptic tagging during LTM storage is difficult to reconcile with this apparently arbitrary elimination of varicosities, both original and 5HT-induced.
