                    "text": "Amyloid protein aggregates are associated with dozens of devastating diseases including Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, ALS, and diabetes type 2. While structure-based discovery of compounds has been effective in combating numerous infectious and metabolic diseases, ignorance of amyloid structure has hindered similar approaches to amyloid disease. Here we show that knowledge of the atomic structure of one of the adhesive, steric-zipper segments of the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) protein of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, when coupled with computational methods, identifies eight diverse but mainly flat compounds and three compound derivatives that reduce A\u03b2 cytotoxicity against mammalian cells by up to 90%. Although these compounds bind to A\u03b2 fibers, they do not reduce fiber formation of A\u03b2. Structure-activity relationship studies of the fiber-binding compounds and their derivatives suggest that compound binding increases fiber stability and decreases fiber toxicity, perhaps by shifting the equilibrium of A\u03b2 from oligomers to fibers."

While structure-based discovery of compounds has been effective in combating numerous infectious and metabolic diseases, ignorance of amyloid structure has hindered similar approaches to amyloid disease. Here we show that knowledge of the atomic structure of one of the adhesive, steric-zipper segments of the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) protein of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, when coupled with computational methods, identifies eight diverse but mainly flat compounds and three compound derivatives that reduce A\u03b2 cytotoxicity against mammalian cells by up to 90%. Although these compounds bind to A\u03b2 fibers, they do not reduce fiber formation of A\u03b2. Structure-activity relationship studies of the fiber-binding compounds and their derivatives suggest that compound binding increases fiber stability and decreases fiber toxicity, perhaps by shifting the equilibrium of A\u03b2 from oligomers to fibers."

Much work has been focused on screening compounds that prevent aggregation and the associated cytotoxicity of the amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) (reviews by <a href=\"#bib51\">Sacchettini and Kelly, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartolini and Andrisano, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hard and Lendel, 2012</a>)."

This approach has been enabled by the determination of atomic structures of the adhesive segments of amyloid fibers, termed steric zippers (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nelson et al., 2005</a>), and of solid state NMR-based structures of amyloid fibers (such as full-length A\u03b2 fibers [<a href=\"#bib41\">Luhrs et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Petkova et al., 2005</a>] and the HET-s prion domain complexed with Congo Red [<a href=\"#bib53\">Schutz et al., 2011</a>]). The steric zipper structures reveal a common motif for the spine of amyloid fibers, in which a pair of fibrillar \u03b2-sheets is held together by the side-chain interdigitation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sawaya et al., 2007</a>). We focus on A\u03b2, a peptide of 39\u201342 residues cleaved from the Amyloid precursor protein (APP) associated with Alzheimer\u2019s, as a target for inhibitor discovery. The segment A\u03b2<sub>16\u201321</sub> with the sequence KLVFFA is an amyloid-forming peptide, which packs in a steric zipper form, and has been identified as the spine of the full-length A\u03b2 fiber (<a href=\"#bib41\">Luhrs et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Petkova et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Colletier et al., 2011</a>). Co-crystal structures have been determined for small molecules in complex with the fibrillar \u03b2-sheets of A\u03b2<sub>16\u201321</sub> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Landau et al., 2011</a>). One of these structures\u2014A\u03b2<sub>16\u201321</sub> with the dye Orange G\u2014reveals the specific pattern of hydrogen bonds and apolar interactions between orange G and the steric zipper: the negatively charged dye binds specifically to lysine side chains of adjacent sheets, and its planar aromatic portion packs against apolar residues (phenylalanine and valine) of adjacent sheets. By creating a tight, low energy interface across several \u03b2-strands within fiber core, this fiber-binding molecule appears to stabilize the fiber structure. With this atomic structure as a basis, we are able to screen for small molecular compounds that bind to amyloid fibers, stabilizing them and possibly reducing amyloid toxicity. Applying our structure-based screening procedure, we screen computationally for compounds that bind to A\u03b2 fibers, termed BAFs (Binders of Amyloid Fibers) and then experimentally test their effects on A\u03b2 aggregation and cytotoxicity."

Five BAFs\u20141,4,8,11, and 12\u2014in the initial cycle and three additional BAFs\u201426, 30, and 31\u2014from the second cycle, with diversified chemical structures shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, significantly increased both PC12 and HeLa cell survival after 24 hr incubation with A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> (0.5 \u00b5M) at concentration of 2.5 \u00b5M, while the BAFs alone had little or no effect on cell survival (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Three BAFs\u201411, 26, and 31\u2014showed clear dose-response profiles in their protection of both PC12 and HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

The proton resonances of the freely rotating compounds disappear as the compound binds to the fibers. By increasing the amount of fibers, an apparent Kd for compound binding can be estimated. From in silico screening, all tested BAF compounds are calculated to bind more tightly to A\u03b2 fibers than orange G. In NMR studies, the apparent Kd of orange G binding to A\u03b2<sub>16\u201321</sub> fibers was found to be 43 \u00b1 21 \u00b5M, whereas the apparent Kd of BAF1 binding to A\u03b2<sub>16\u201321</sub> fibers is 12 \u00b1 7 \u00b5M.

That is, all BAFs with predicted binding energy better than orange G also reduce NMR peak areas more than orange G. On the other hand, BAF31\u0394OH, a derivative of BAF31 by removal of a key hydroxyl group essential for binding, exhibits both a worse calculated binding energy and a diminished reduction of NMR peak upon titration of A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> fibers."

By monitoring the aromatic regions of the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of BAFs 1, 8, and 31, these compounds were shown to bind to both A\u03b2<sub>16\u201321</sub> and A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> fibers more tightly than does orange G. As shown in (<b>A</b> and <b>B</b>), BAF1 binds to A\u03b2<sub>16\u201321</sub> fibers with affinity stronger than orange G. The determination of binding parameters for A\u03b2<sub>16\u201321</sub> fibers is detailed in <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1 fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1 and 3</a>. In panel (<b>A</b>)<b>,</b> the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of compound BAF1 (at 100 \u03bcM) is shown as a function of increasing concentration of A\u03b2<sub>16\u201321</sub> fibers (0\u2013500 \u03bcM, as monomer). The insert shows the area decrease of BAF1 NMR peaks as a function of A\u03b2<sub>16\u201321</sub> concentration, and the red curve fitting the data defines an apparent Kd of 12 \u00b1 7 \u00b5M. In panel (<b>B</b>), the NMR spectrum of orange G (50 \u03bcM) is plotted against increasing concentration of A\u03b2<sub>16\u201321</sub> fibers (0\u2013950 \u03bcM), giving an apparent Kd of 43 \u00b1 21 \u00b5M. In (<b>C</b>, <b>D</b> and <b>E</b>), BAFs 1 and 8 both bind to A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> fibers more strongly than orange G. Notice that the molar ratio of BAFs to A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> fibers is comparable to that used in cell toxicity assays (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). (<b>F</b>). The calculated binding energies of BAFs\u20141, 8, and 31\u2014to A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> fibers are compared to the decreases in NMR peak of these compounds upon their binding to full-length A\u03b2 fibers. These three BAFs have higher affinities and a larger NMR peak reduction than orange G while the \u2018knock-out\u2019 derivative with removal of key interactions (BAF31\u0394OH) discussed below has a weaker calculated affinity and a smaller NMR peak reduction than orange G. We observe good correlation between computed energies and experimental data from NMR."

BAF11 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), one of the lead compounds in the initial cycle, was used to perform structure-activity relationship studies. Twelve derivatives of BAF11 were scanned to pinpoint the essential apolar and polar interactions for the pharmacorphore refinement (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These derivatives are grouped in five classes, whose effects on A\u03b2 toxicity have been tested (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Classes I and II assess the polar region of BAF11, which makes hydrogen bonds to charged Lys16 ladders of the A\u03b2 fiber: the deletion of the hydroxyl group (Class I) significantly decreased the inhibition of toxicity; the swapping of the hydroxyl group with the aromatic tail (Class II) almost abolished inhibition of toxicity. Classes III, IV, and V focused on the aromatic moieties of BAF11: altering the sizes of aromatic groups (Class III) showed little change in inhibition of toxicity while adding charged or polar groups within aromatic region (Classes IV and V) resulted in a significant decrease of inhibition of toxicity. These differences among BAF11 derivatives in inhibition of toxicity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) further validated our structure-based approach and provided guidelines for the refinement of A\u03b2 pharmacophore."

The widely used ligand-docking software, such as DOCK (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ewing et al., 2001</a>), or AutoDock (<a href=\"#bib44\">Morris et al., 2009</a>), is intended to fit well-defined protein pockets rather than shallow grooves at flat fiber surfaces."

The initial site is chosen near that occupied by a bound compound, as determined in a crystal structure. The conformational flexibilities of ligand and protein side chains are modeled in a \u2018near-native\u2019 perturbation fashion (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019), meaning that the fine sampling of conformations was restrained to be close to the starting conformation. To find the position along the flat fibrillar surface of greatest binding energy for each candidate compound, our screening approach leverages the rotamer repacking algorithm (<a href=\"#bib39\">Leaver-Fay et al., 2011</a>) and Rosetta energy function (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kuhlman and Baker, 2000</a>) to account for flexibility of protein side chains and ligand, which is critical in modeling of such shallow grooves on the fiber surface."

In recent work (<a href=\"#bib35\">Laganowsky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Liu et al., 2012</a>), we proposed that amyloid forming proteins can enter either of two distinct aggregation pathways, which are separated by an energy barrier. One pathway leads to in-register fibers in which every \u03b2-strand lies directly above or below an identical strand in the fiber. The other pathway leads to out-of-register oligomers in which antiparallel \u03b2-strands are sheared relative to one another and roll into a \u03b2-barrel. We found that three out-of-register amyloid-like structures exhibit cytotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Laganowsky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Liu et al., 2012</a>), which tend to be transient, equilibrating eventually into in-register fibers. In our approach, we search for BAFs based on in-register \u03b2-sheets rather than out-of-register \u03b2-strands found in toxic oligomeric structures, to which our BAFs are not expected to bind (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). We speculate that BAFs stabilize the in-register fibers revealed by our steric zippers, relative to out-of-register toxic oligomers, thereby shifting the equilibrium from toxic oligomers towards fibers (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>).

Specially, we sampled the ligand and protein side-chain torsion angles in near-\u2018native\u2019 perturbation fashion, where only the near-\u2018native\u2019 conformation of side-chain and ligand rotamers were allowed and any conformation far away from the starting conformation was omitted.

The fusion construct for A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> expression contains an N-terminal His tags, followed by 19 repeats of Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro, TEV protease site and the human A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> sequence. Briefly, the fusion construct was expressed into inclusion bodies in <i>E.coli</i> BL21(DE3) cells. 8 M urea was used to solubilize the inclusion bodies. Fusion proteins were purified through HisTrap HP Columns, followed by Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). After TEV cleavage, A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> peptide was purified from the cleavage solution by RP\u2013HPLC followed by lyophilization. To disrupt preformed aggregation, lyophilized A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> was resuspended in 100% Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) which was finally removed by evaporation."

A CellTiter 96 aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay kit (MTT) (Promega cat. #G4100, Madison, WI) was used. HeLa and PC-12 (ATCC; cat. # CRL-1721, Manassas, VA) cell lines were used for measuring the toxicity of A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub>. Prior to toxicity test, both HeLa and PC-12 cell lines were plated at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plates (Costar cat. # 3596, Washington, DC). HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, PC-12 cells were cultured in ATCC-formulated RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC; cat.# 30\u20132001) with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates for 20 hr at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> and BAFs samples preparation, purified A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> was dissolved in PBS at the final concentration of 5 \u03bcM, followed by the addition of BAFs at indicated concentrations. The mixtures were filtered with a 0.2-\u03bcm filter and further incubated for 16 hr at 37\u00b0C without shaking for fiber formation. To start the MTT assay, 10 \u03bcl of pre-incubated mixture was added to each well containing 90 \u03bcl medium. After 24 hr incubation at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 15 \u03bcl Dye solution (Promega cat. #G4102) was added into each well. After incubation for 4 hr at 37\u00b0C, 100 \u03bcl solubilization Solution/Stop Mix (Promega cat. #G4101) was added to each well. After 12 hr incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm with background absorbance recorded at 700 nm. Four replicates were measured for each of the samples. The MTT cell viability assay measured the percentage of survival cell upon the treatment of the mixture of A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> and BAFs. The toxicity inhibition (%) or rescuing percentage (%) of each BAF compound was calculated by normalizing the cell survival rate using the PBS buffer-treated cells as 100% and 0.5 \u03bcM (final concentration) A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> fiber alone-treated cell as 0% viability<b>.</b>"

For specimen preparation, 5 \u03bcl solution was spotted onto freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated electron microscopy grids (Ted Pella, Redding, CA). Grids were rinsed twice with 5 \u03bcl distilled water after 3 min incubation, followed by staining with 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min. A CM120 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV was used to examine the specimens. Images were recorded digitally by TIETZ F224HD CCD camera."

A\u03b2<sub>1\u201342</sub> was diluted into PBS buffer at the final concentration of 20 \u03bcM, and was mixed with 20 \u03bcM Thioflavin T (ThT) and different concentrations of BAFs. The reaction mixture was filtered with a 0.2 \u03bcm filter, split into four replicates and placed in a 96-well plate (black with flat optic bottom).

They validate the binding of the peptides by NMR, followed up by assays for fibril formation, and also show that the small molecules alleviate the toxicity of the amylogenic peptides to mammalian cells. This work builds on earlier results from the Eisenberg group that established high-resolution crystal structures for many different kinds of peptide fibrils and revealed how small molecules such as Orange G bind to them. The work also follows on earlier studies from others (for example, Pastore and Wanker) on the effects of small molecules on amylogenic peptides. What is new in the present work, however, is the use of computational docking to come up with novel pharmacophores. This is interesting because the binding sites on the fibrils are quite different from the deep hydrophobic cavities that are the targets of conventional docking efforts. Here, the binding sites are flat, and although hydrophobicity is still important, the small molecules lie along the flat surfaces of the fibrils and are anchored by polar residues in a way that stabilizes the fibrils."

To explore the possibility raised by the reviewers that our small molecule compounds (termed BAFs) might target oligomers, we designed experiments to test whether BAFs are capable of inhibiting pre-formed toxic Abeta oligomers using the MTT cell viability assay. The results of these new experiments are given in new <a href=\"#tbl7\">Table 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>: four BAFs, which significantly reduce Abeta toxicity, show no protective effects on the toxicity of pre-formed Abeta oligomers.

These reasons are based on recent work (Laganowsky et al., Science 2012; Liu et al., PNAS 2012), which shows that the structural features of a toxic oligomer are distinct from those observed in fibrils. As we detail in the Discussion section of the present paper, we applied our structure-based approach to search for BAFs that bind to flat in-register \u03b2-sheets in fibril structures rather than out-of-register \u03b2-strands found in toxic oligomeric structures. As highlighted in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>, these small molecules are predicted to bind along the hydrophobic in-register \u03b2-sheet surfaces of the fibrils and to be anchored by polar residues (i.e., Lysine 16 of Abeta fibril in this case). The distances between the Lys residues that interact with the small molecules have distinct differences between in-register \u03b2-sheets (left panel) and out-of-register \u03b2-strands (right panel). Since we search for the small molecules (in a green color) compatible with the geometry of Lys residues in in-register \u03b2-sheets, these small molecules are not expected to bind out-of-register oligomer. Together with our new experimental results, we speculate that the BAFs are unable to bind to Abeta oligomers, and this difference accounts for the diminished toxicity that accompanies specific binding of the small molecules."
