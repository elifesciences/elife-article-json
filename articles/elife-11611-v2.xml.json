                    "text": "Polarity establishment in many cells is thought to occur via positive feedback that reinforces even tiny asymmetries in polarity protein distribution. Cdc42 and related GTPases are activated and accumulate in a patch of the cortex that defines the front of the cell. Positive feedback enables spontaneous polarization triggered by stochastic fluctuations, but as such fluctuations can occur at multiple locations, how do cells ensure that they make only one front? In polarizing cells of the model yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, positive feedback can trigger growth of several Cdc42 clusters at the same time, but this multi-cluster stage rapidly evolves to a single-cluster state, which then promotes bud emergence. By manipulating polarity protein dynamics, we show that resolution of multi-cluster intermediates occurs through a greedy competition between clusters to recruit and retain polarity proteins from a shared intracellular pool."

Cdc42 and related GTPases are activated and accumulate in a patch of the cortex that defines the front of the cell. Positive feedback enables spontaneous polarization triggered by stochastic fluctuations, but as such fluctuations can occur at multiple locations, how do cells ensure that they make only one front? In polarizing cells of the model yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, positive feedback can trigger growth of several Cdc42 clusters at the same time, but this multi-cluster stage rapidly evolves to a single-cluster state, which then promotes bud emergence. By manipulating polarity protein dynamics, we show that resolution of multi-cluster intermediates occurs through a greedy competition between clusters to recruit and retain polarity proteins from a shared intracellular pool."

Only a single cluster emerges as the winner, while the others lose and shrink away. How does this happen? One possibility is that Cdc42 clusters all compete with each other to attract polarity proteins from the cell interior, so that when a protein falls off one cluster it can be picked up by another."

Here, Wu et al. use microscopy and mathematical modelling to distinguish between these two possible scenarios in budding yeast. The experiments show that the speed of competition can be manipulated by altering how quickly key polarity proteins move between the membrane and the interior of the cell. Cells with slowed competition can maintain multiple fronts for long enough to make several buds at the same time."

                        "text": "Differentiated cells exhibit a stunning variety of morphologies that enable specialized cell-specific functions. Morphological diversity emerges, in part, from specialization of cortical domains, which are often demarcated by the local accumulation of active GTPases. Among the best-understood cortical specification events is the establishment of cell polarity, wherein local accumulation of a cortical Rho-family GTPase (Cdc42, Rac, or Rop depending on the organism) creates a region destined to become the 'front' (<a href=\"#bib15\">Etienne-Manneville, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Park and Bi, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yang and Lavagi, 2012</a>). For some cells, restricting polarity to a single front is absolutely imperative: for example, a migrating leukocyte with two fronts would split itself apart (<a href=\"#bib22\">Houk et al., 2012</a>). However, other cells routinely specify more than one front: for example, neurons can grow several neurites simultaneously, each with a front-like tip (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dotti et al., 1988</a>). Similar phenomena occur in plants and fungi, raising the question of how different cell types generate the correct number of fronts (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wu and Lew, 2013</a>). Here we focus on the mechanism whereby budding yeast cells guarantee that they only establish a single polarity site, growing one and only one bud."

                        "text": "Polarity establishment is thought to occur through a cooperative process involving positive feedback, which allows localized fluctuations in concentration to set off growth of a cluster of polarity factors to establish a front (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bi and Park, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Johnson et al., 2011</a>). But if stochastic effects can trigger production of a front, what restricts cells to form only one front? A potential mechanism involves competition between different fronts for a common pool of polarity factors (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goryachev and Pokhilko, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Howell et al., 2009</a>). The strongest experimental support for this competition hypothesis comes from studies of 're-wired' yeast cells that were engineered to use a synthetic polarity factor created from a fusion between two endogenous proteins (<a href=\"#bib23\">Howell et al., 2009</a>). In that system, many cells were observed to initially form two fronts (cortical sites enriched for the synthetic protein). In the majority of cells that developed two fronts, one front then grew stronger while the other concurrently grew weaker and disappeared. When a cell initially developed only one front, that front never shrank or disappeared, suggesting that in the two-front cells, growth of the 'winning' front was responsible for the disappearance of the 'losing' front, as predicted by the competition hypothesis. In a few cells, the two initial polarity sites did eventually grow into buds, indicating that competition is not fully effective in re-wired cells."

                        "text": "Whether competition is responsible for the uniqueness of the front in yeast with a natural (as opposed to synthetic) polarity system is not known. Although we detected initial development of two or more polarity clusters prior to establishment of a single front (<a href=\"#bib24\">Howell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wu et al., 2013</a>), others did not (<a href=\"#bib34\">Klunder et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, even when a transient multi-cluster intermediate was observed, the process whereby such early intermediates were resolved to a single front remained unclear. Unlike in the strains with a synthetically rewired polarity pathway (<a href=\"#bib23\">Howell et al., 2009</a>), in the natural system early polarity clusters were observed to disappear spontaneously even when there was no other cluster present (<a href=\"#bib24\">Howell et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the disappearance of a cluster could not be unambiguously attributed to the presence of a competing cluster in the same cell."

This behavior was traced to a negative feedback loop in the yeast polarity circuit (<a href=\"#bib24\">Howell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kuo et al., 2014</a>). As the combination of positive and negative feedback can yield a pulse generator (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brandman and Meyer, 2008</a>), it could be that stochastic fluctuations routinely trigger growth of a cluster by positive feedback followed by cluster dissolution due to negative feedback. But if that is the case, then why don\u2019t ALL polarity clusters disappear? Why does one and only one cluster remain stable following the initial dynamic behavior? One possibility is that during their brief existence, initial (unstable) polarity clusters have a chance to capture a critical stabilizing factor. Then, once a lucky cluster had captured the stabilizer, all other clusters would be doomed to disappear. Like the competition hypothesis, the stabilizer hypothesis can explain resolution of a multi-cluster intermediate to a final single-front state. Indeed, some models in the field posit that actin cables play roles analogous to the stabilizer, reinforcing polarity clusters and protecting them from dissolution (<a href=\"#bib17\">Freisinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2003</a>)."

Actin cables are bundles of parallel actin filaments nucleated by formins: their primary role is to enable myosin-driven delivery of cargo towards the bud (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pruyne et al., 2004</a>). Actin patches are assemblies of branched actin filaments nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex: their primary role is to promote internalization of endocytic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kaksonen et al., 2006</a>). Both actin cable-mediated traffic of secretory vesicles and actin patch-mediated endocytosis have been proposed to stabilize and reinforce polarity clusters (<a href=\"#bib17\">Freisinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jose et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Marco et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Slaughter et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2004</a>). When yeast cells were treated with Latrunculin to depolymerize actin, polarity clusters were observed to serially assemble and disassemble, sometimes relocating from one site to another, to a much greater degree than seen in untreated cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Howell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Okada et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). This observation is consistent with a potential 'stabilizer' role for actin: in cells with two polarity clusters, the first one to capture some actin structure may be stabilized and persist while the other disappears due to negative feedback."

We show that the speed of competition can be manipulated by altering the rates at which key polarity factors exchange between membrane and cytoplasm, and that cells with slowed competition can maintain multiple fronts for long enough to make two, three, or even four buds simultaneously. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism of competition, uncovering how yeast cells can guarantee the uniqueness of the front."

Localized landmarks influence the site of polarization through the Ras-family GTPase Rsr1, and polarity clusters tend to form near the poles (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). Because polarity factors also accumulate at the cytokinesis site (which overlaps one pole), some polarity clusters are difficult to quantify separate from the cytokinesis signal. In the absence of Rsr1, polarity clusters can form over much of the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bender and Pringle, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Howell et al., 2012</a>), allowing easier imaging of the resolution from &gt;1 cluster to a single cluster.

Thus, we considered the possibility that the septin ring might act as a stabilizer. We visualized septin structures using the functional septin probe Cdc3-mCherry (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caviston et al., 2003</a>). Septins assembled into a ring around the polarity site several minutes after Bem1 became detectable (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). In cells that formed two polarity clusters, septins were not readily detectable at either cluster until after one cluster disappeared in most cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). However, we occasionally detected septins at both clusters before one cluster disappeared (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Thus, septins also seem unlikely to act as the stabilizer.

In this scenario, the relevant factors must exchange dynamically between the cluster and the cell interior on a timescale that is rapid relative to the time it takes to resolve the multi-cluster intermediate. Indeed, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments indicate that polarity factors exchange in and out of clusters on a 2\u20134\u2009s timeframe (<a href=\"#bib17\">Freisinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Slaughter et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2004</a>), whereas multi-cluster resolution occurs on a 1\u20132\u2009min timeframe (<a href=\"#bib24\">Howell et al., 2012</a>). If the exchange of relevant polarity factors in and out of the clusters were to be slowed, then resolution of multicluster intermediates should also occur more slowly. To test this prediction, we generated strains in which Cdc42, or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Cdc24, or the scaffold protein Bem1, exchanged more slowly between membrane and cytoplasm."

We confirmed previous reports (<a href=\"#bib17\">Freisinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Slaughter et al., 2009</a>) that in the absence of the sole yeast Rho-GDI, Rdi1, exchange of Cdc42 in and out of the polarity cluster was much slower (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>), while levels of total Cdc42 were similar in wild-type and <i>rdi1</i>\u0394 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Biochemical experiments indicated that Cdc42 was able to exchange between different lipid vesicles in vitro even in the absence of a GDI (<a href=\"#bib26\">Johnson et al., 2009</a>), and there was still a substantial pool of Cdc42 in the cytoplasm of <i>rdi1</i>\u0394 mutants lacking a GDI, as detected either by fractionation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tiedje et al., 2008</a>) or fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (<a href=\"#bib12\">Das et al., 2012</a>). Thus, we anticipated that the slowed Cdc42 dynamics were due to slower exchange of Cdc42 between membrane and cytoplasm, and we fused the Cdc42 polybasic-prenyl motif to the C-termini of Cdc24 and Bem1 (hereafter Cdc24-CAAX and Bem1-CAAX: <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) in order to slow the exchange of these proteins. However, others have argued that in the absence of the GDI, Cdc42 is 'locked on' to cellular membranes, and that the observed exchange of Cdc42 in and out of the polarity site is due to actin-mediated vesicle trafficking (<a href=\"#bib17\">Freisinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Slaughter et al., 2009</a>). Thus, we first investigated whether Bem1-CAAX would polarize using membrane-cytoplasm exchange or vesicle trafficking."

This fusion protein was able to replace endogenous Bem1, but created a situation in which formin-nucleated actin cables and actin patch-mediated endocytosis became essential for polarization, because the Bem1-Snc2 protein could only traffic on vesicles and not through the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Howell et al., 2009</a>).

This system is based on the ability of the drug rapamycin to induce a stable interaction between FKBP (Fpr1 in yeast) and the FKBP-binding domain (FRB) of Tor1. We fused two tandem copies of FKBP to the ribosomal protein Rpl13A, and two tandem copies of FRB to Bem1-CAAX. Upon addition of rapamycin, this should induce binding of Bem1-CAAX to ribosomes. If Bem1-CAAX is able to exchange between membrane and cytoplasm, then rapamycin should trap it in the cytoplasm, resulting in a loss of Bem1-CAAX from the polarity site. On the other hand, if Bem1-CAAX were locked onto membranes, then rapamycin should not affect Bem1-CAAX localization (though some ribosomes might become attached to the membrane). We found that rapamycin led to a rapid loss of detectable Bem1-CAAX from the polarity site in all cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), providing independent evidence that Bem1-CAAX exchanges between membrane and cytoplasm. In aggregate, these experiments indicate that the polybasic-prenyl motif slows but does not eliminate membrane-cytoplasm exchange, and that it is valid to use <i>rdi1</i>\u0394 mutants as a way to slow exchange of Cdc42, and Bem1-CAAX and Cdc24-CAAX as a way to slow exchange of Bem1 and Cdc24, between membrane and cytoplasm."

Simultaneous formation of two buds has been documented previously for <i>rdi1</i>\u0394 mutants, although those investigators had a somewhat different interpretation as to the cause of multibudding (<a href=\"#bib17\">Freisinger et al., 2013</a>)\u00a0(see Discussion). Buds could be similar (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, cell 1; 7C, cell 1) or dissimilar (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, cells 2,3; 7C, cell 2) in size, but both buds always emerged at about the same time. This observation indicates that the size difference does not arise because one bud gets a head start; rather, in those cases with different-sized buds competition had proceeded to form unequal clusters at the time of bud emergence, giving one bud a growth advantage. In a few cases, the smaller bud ceased growing (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, cells 2,3), suggesting that competition continued even after bud emergence, leaving an abandoned bud. We never (n&gt;200) saw a bud stop growing in cells that had only a single bud, suggesting that abandonment of the bud is due to competition with another bud. These findings indicate that the presence of actin and septin structures is unable to stabilize a cluster against competition, arguing strongly against the stabilizer hypothesis."

Like earlier Turing-type models (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Turing, 1952</a>), some of these can generate and maintain more than one peak of polarity factors in sufficiently large domains. However, a bottom-up model describing the activities and interactions of the yeast Cdc42, Cdc24, Bem1, and GDI proteins displays competition between polarity clusters for all parameters examined thus far (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goryachev and Pokhilko, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Howell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Howell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Savage et al., 2012</a>). In this model, whose elements have considerable experimental support (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kozubowski et al., 2008</a>), clustering of Cdc42 occurs through a positive feedback loop involving a cytoplasmic complex that contains Bem1 and the GEF Cdc24. Cortical GTP-Cdc42 recruits Bem1-Cdc24 complexes from the cytoplasm, which then load neighboring Cdc42 with GTP, leading to further Bem1-Cdc24 recruitment and Cdc42 activation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Additional Cdc42 is delivered to the growing cluster from the cytoplasm by the GDI, as well as by other pathways (<a href=\"#bib27\">Johnson et al., 2011</a>). Because of positive feedback, stochastic activation of a small amount of Cdc42 somewhere on the membrane leads to further accumulation of active Cdc42 until depletion of the cytoplasmic pools of polarity proteins stops the process. With suitable parameter choices, the system develops a stable polarized peak of GTP-Cdc42: diffusion, inactivation, and release of Cdc42 into the cytoplasm is counteracted by recruitment of more Cdc42 to the peak from the cytoplasmic GDI-bound pool (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). As discussed above, FRAP experiments confirm that apparently stable polarized peaks are indeed maintained by very dynamic recycling of the Cdc42, Bem1, and Cdc24."

We first consider the Bem1-GEF complex. The larger peak has a higher concentration of GTP-Cdc42, which can bind Bem1-GEF from the cytoplasm: this gives it an advantage over the smaller peak in recruiting Bem1-GEF (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). To evaluate loss of Bem1-GEF from the peak, we started with an arbitrary amount of Cdc42-Bem1-GEF, and ran simulations to monitor the loss of Bem1-GEF from the membrane over time, for different values of GTP-Cdc42 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). With higher levels of GTP-Cdc42 (i.e. for larger peaks), it takes longer for Bem1-GEF complexes to detach from the membrane, because when a complex detaches from one molecule of GTP-Cdc42 it is more likely to bind to another GTP-Cdc42 rather than release into the cytoplasm. From these data we extracted the half-life for membrane-bound Bem1-GEF (dwell time), which increased linearly with GTP-Cdc42 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>). See the Materials and methods for a quasi-steady state approximation demonstrating this effect of GTP-Cdc42 on the Bem1-GEF dwell time."

To compute the dwell time of Cdc42 as a function of the membrane-bound Bem1-GEF concentration, we used a similar approach as described above for computing the Bem1-GEF loss according to the governing equations (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H</a>, inset). Delivery of Cdc42 from the cytoplasm by the GDI is unaffected by protein concentrations at the membrane, so a similar amount of Cdc42 will be delivered to the center of each peak from the cytoplasm. However, because the larger peak has more Bem1-GEF, GDP-Cdc42 in a larger peak is converted more rapidly to GTP-Cdc42. Because the GDI only extracts GDP-Cdc42, more GEF activity translates to a reduced loss of Cdc42 to the cytoplasm, and hence a longer dwell time (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H</a>). See the Materials and methods for a quasi-steady state approximation demonstrating how Cdc42 dwell time is related to GEF activity. In summary, the larger peak has an edge in recruiting Bem1-GEF complexes and in retaining both Cdc42 and Bem1-GEF. Thus, the net flux of both species from the cytoplasm to the center of the peak is greater for larger peaks. This mismatch in recruitment and retention for peaks of different sizes provides a mechanism that promotes competition."

As a peak grows or shrinks, its 'waistline' also grows or shrinks in parallel (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). We define the 'waistline' as the circle at which Cdc42 concentration is half-maximal (i.e. circle diameter is the peak width at half-height) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9I</a>, inset). (The following qualitative argument is not sensitive to the exact definition of the waistline). Monitoring the dissipative flux of Cdc42 due to diffusion across the waistline, we see that a larger peak does not lose as great a proportion of its Cdc42 content as does a smaller peak (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9I</a>). Thus, diffusion provides a more powerful dissipative effect for the smaller peak, favoring the larger peak in a competition scenario (<a href=\"#bib23\">Howell et al., 2009</a>)."

From this graph, which is derived from the full simulation of competition in <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>, it is easy to understand why the two-peak solution is unstable. The steady state with two peaks of equal size corresponds to the middle intersection point on the flux plot (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9J</a>). If the peaks become slightly unequal, then the diffusional loss is greater than Cdc42 recruitment for the smaller peak (left of intersection point), causing this peak to shrink. However, for the larger peak (right of intersection point), the Cdc42 recruitment flux is greater than the diffusional flux, and this peak grows until the system reaches the one-peak steady state."

This behavior has been traced to a negative feedback loop that operates via inhibitory phosphorylation of the GEF Cdc24 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kuo et al., 2014</a>), reducing the level of active GEF available for positive feedback."

As predicted by the substrate depletion scenario, cells that made a single bud developed polarity clusters with a higher polarity protein content than those in cells that made two buds (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>).

This may explain why another recent study detected many fewer multi-cluster intermediates when imaging only the medial planes of large cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Klunder et al., 2013</a>).

When polarity factor concentration is low, small initial clusters grow more slowly, perhaps allowing more time for diffusion-based merging of nearby clusters to form a broad and shallow single peak (<a href=\"#bib34\">Klunder et al., 2013</a>). However, it is unclear whether merging is sufficient to explain the reduced incidence of multi-cluster intermediates. In our slow-exchange mutant strains, clusters often co-existed in close proximity for prolonged periods. This suggests that merging is inefficient, presumably because diffusion is very slow in the yeast plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib60\">Valdez-Taubas and Pelham, 2003</a>). An alternative hypothesis is that whereas the models display hair-trigger Turing instability, in the cells it may take more than just a tiny asymmetry to set off growth of a cluster. Indeed, inclusion of negative feedback can produce this effect in the model (<a href=\"#bib24\">Howell et al., 2012</a>). If stochastic events need to cross some threshold of local polarity factor concentration in order to trigger growth of a cluster, then the frequency of such stochastic events may be quite sensitive to polarity protein concentration."

                        "text": "Given that cells frequently develop more than one initial cluster of polarity factors, there must be a mechanism to eliminate excess clusters so that only one persists to form the front. We suggest that this mechanism involves competition between polarity clusters for components including Cdc42, Bem1, and Cdc24. Each of these factors exchanges constantly and rapidly (2\u20135\u2009s half-time) between the polarity cluster and the cell interior (<a href=\"#bib17\">Freisinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Slaughter et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2004</a>). Polarity factors released from one cluster may be captured by another, and if larger clusters have an advantage in recruiting and retaining such factors, then they would grow at the expense of smaller clusters. Consistent with that hypothesis, we found that slowing the exchange of Cdc42, Bem1, or Cdc24 in and out of the clusters resulted in correspondingly slower resolution of multi-cluster intermediates, leading to the occasional formation of more than one bud. Combinatorial slowing of polarity factor exchange had additive effects, yielding strains that frequently made more than one bud."

Those authors suggested that in the absence of <i>RDI1</i>, polarity establishment occurs through a pathway involving actin cables, and that once actin cables attach at a particular site the cell is committed to making a bud there. Our data argue against this hypothesis: we found that several polarity clusters could recruit actin cables (as judged by delivery of vesicles) in both wild-type and <i>rdi1</i>\u0394 mutant cells, but this did not prevent elimination of most clusters. Slow resolution of multi-cluster intermediates also continued in <i>rdi1</i>\u0394 and other slow-exchange strains after septins had been recruited, and even in some instances after buds had begun to grow. Thus, it would seem that neither actin cables nor indeed any other 'stabilizer' acts to lock in a polarity site in cells that have other polarity sites. Notably, slow-exchange mutant cells that developed only one cluster never eliminated that cluster. These findings imply that it is the presence of a competing cluster that promotes the dissolution of other clusters in the same cell."

Indeed, this type of mechanism has been proposed to explain why neutrophils maintain only one front (<a href=\"#bib22\">Houk et al., 2012</a>). As in yeast, more than one front can transiently co-exist in neutrophils. Each front promotes actin polymerization and membrane protrusion, leading to increased membrane tension, which in turn appears to inhibit GTPase activation. Thus, tension promoted by a dominant GTPase cluster actively extinguishes smaller clusters. This seems unlikely to account for the elimination of excess Cdc42 clusters in yeast. First, membrane tension in yeast (and other walled cells) is determined by turgor pressure rather than actin polymerization. Second, if a yet to be identified inhibition mechanism was functioning in yeast, it is not obvious why slowing the exchange of polarity factors would counteract it. Thus, the simplest hypothesis is that elimination of excess clusters reflects the depletion of polarity factors from losing clusters as they are acquired by a competing cluster."

If there are sufficient polarity factors to make several functional fronts, why is it that in wild-type cells, competition continues until there is only a single winner? Analyses of a computational model incorporating some of the known interactions among yeast polarity factors suggests that a larger cluster would have significant advantages over a smaller cluster in both recruiting and retaining polarity factors. The insatiably acquisitive nature of this competitive process would lead to an inexorable rich-get-richer spiral in which the winning cluster starves all others of polarity factors. This behavior has clear parallels (though with differences in mechanism) to coarsening phenomena in physics (<a href=\"#bib54\">Semplice et al., 2012</a>)."

In plant roots, each trichoblast cell polarizes to grow a single root hair (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cole and Fowler, 2006</a>). Root hair outgrowth is regulated by the GTPase Rop2, a member of a plant-specific 'Rop' family closely related to Cdc42 and Rac GTPases (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jones et al., 2002</a>). Strikingly, mutations in a plant GDI gene lead to the frequent production of multiple growing root hair sites in a single cell (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carol et al., 2005</a>). We speculate that competition between polarity sites for Rop2 may ensure that only one root hair grows per cell. By analogy to our findings for yeast, slowing the exchange of Rop2 may impair competition in that system, allowing more than one site to initiate tip growth."

Monoclonal mouse anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science,\u00a0Germany) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Polyclonal rabbit anti-Cdc11 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,\u00a0Dallas,\u00a0TX) was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse (IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG, LI-COR Biosciences,\u00a0Lincoln,\u00a0NE) or rabbit (Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Invitrogen,\u00a0Carlsbad,\u00a0CA) antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilutions. Blots were visualized and quantified using the ODYSSEY imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences)."

Membrane-localized Cdc42 exchanges between GDP-bound and GTP-bound states. GDP/GTP exchange is catalyzed by the GEF, in complex with Bem1. This complex exchanges between membrane and cytoplasm, and can bind reversibly to GTP-Cdc42. Two other Cdc42 regulators are represented implicitly by first-order reactions: GAPs promote GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42 (rate constant k2b), and the GDI reversibly exchanges GDP-Cdc42 between membrane and cytoplasm (rate constants k5a and k5b). Positive feedback occurs because binding of the Bem1 complex to GTP-Cdc42 increases local GEF activity in regions with higher GTP-Cdc42, generating more local GTP-Cdc42, which can in turn recruit more Bem1 complex. The equations are deterministic with the exception of the Bem1 complex, which is subject to Gaussian white noise <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mi>\u03be</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></math> with the strength s = 0.0001, as follows:"

Continued simulation with noise yielded a minuscule difference between peaks, initiating the growth of one peak at the expense of the other (<a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>).

The first step in the process is to linearize the model equations around the homogenous solution. The linear equations govern the system\u2019s response to small perturbations and can be used to determine which spatial modes become unstable as a model parameter is varied. Because the computational domain is a sphere, solutions to the linearized equations can be represented as a series solution in terms of spherical harmonics and a modified Bessel function of the first kind. The eigenvalues associate with the modes (l,m) of the spherical harmonic expansion satisfy characteristic equations determined by the model equations and boundary conditions. We numerically find the roots of the characteristic equations and look for eigenvalues that have positive real parts. Eigenvalues with positive real parts indicate exponential growth of that mode and are a sufficient condition for demonstrating the homogenous solution is unstable. A necessary condition for competition between peaks is the existence of more than one eigenvalue with positive real part."

Positive feedback mechanisms are known to promote spontaneous polarization by enhancing stochastic fluctuations of Cdc42 at the cell cortex. Previous observations from the same group showed that, in budding yeast, the emergence of polarized sites can occur at multiple sites simultaneously, but then evolves into a single site. These observations suggest that polarity sites are in competition with each other. However, the underlying mechanism of this competition for singularity is not well understood. Here, the authors propose that competition is governed by the dynamic turnover of polarity proteins at the polarized site."

Can prenylated proteins readily detach and re-attach at the membrane? For Cdc42, extraction from the membrane requires a dedicated GDI (and indeed their own model does not hypothesize any attachment/detachment of Cdc42-GTP, which is not a substrate (or a poor substrate) for the GDI). The authors state that \"Bem1-CAAX exchange between membrane and cytosol was slower than that of Bem1\". However, I do not see any evidence that Bem1-CAAX is cytosolic at all. The internal signal shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> may also be due to endo-membrane association. In addition, as prenylation occurs post-translationally at the ER, prenylated proteins are trafficked through the secretory system. Thus, Bem1-CAAX may well be delivered and retrieved from the plasma membrane via exo- and endocytosis. This allele may thus not be too dissimilar from the Bem1-Snc2 fusion previously published by this group, which also led to multi-bud formation, but was interpreted to do so because it used the slower actin-based feedback system (Howell, Cell 2009). Because of its enhanced membrane binding, the Bem1-CAAX allele certainly also has effects on the levels of available Bem1 (even if global levels are unchanged) and on Bem1 diffusion rates at the membrane. I thus do not think that this approach allows them to specifically slow down membrane-cytosol exchange, nor make any strong conclusion about it."

In <a href=\"#media4\">video 4</a>, there is a weak Cdc3 signal on the disassembling left patch at timepoint 8:15, and one before the transient disassembly of the right patch at 9:45 to 11:15, in agreement with recent data that septins contribute in negative feedback for Cdc42 patch disassembly (see for instance Okada et al.

The simulations were initiated with identical perturbations on two sites and followed what steady state is reached.

I believe the main issue is a conceptual flaw in the design of the study, described below. To slow down Bem1 and Cdc24 (a scaffold and GEF part of a positive feedback mechanism on Cdc42, respectively) exchange between membrane and cytosol, the authors choose to add a prenylation CAAX box (from Cdc42). Can prenylated proteins readily detach and re-attach at the membrane? For Cdc42, extraction from the membrane requires a dedicated GDI (and indeed their own model does not hypothesize any attachment/detachment of Cdc42-GTP, which is not a substrate (or a poor substrate) for the GDI). The authors state that \"Bem1-CAAX exchange between membrane and cytosol was slower than that of Bem1\". However, I do not see any evidence that Bem1-CAAX is cytosolic at all. The internal signal shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> may also be due to endo-membrane association. In addition, as prenylation occurs post-translationally at the ER, prenylated proteins are trafficked through the secretory system. Thus, Bem1-CAAX may well be delivered and retrieved from the plasma membrane via exo- and endocytosis. This allele may thus not be too dissimilar from the Bem1-Snc2 fusion previously published by this group, which also led to multi-bud formation, but was interpreted to do so because it used the slower actin-based feedback system (Howell, Cell 2009).</i>"

This issue is complicated by the presence of negative feedback: as published elsewhere (Howell et al. Cell 2012, Kuo et al.

The estimate from Marco et al. involved fitting FRAP data on the assumption that CAAX\u2212containing proteins cannot exchange between membrane and cytoplasm. But as discussed above, we believe that assumption to be wrong. Thus, the fit would overestimate the diffusion constant because it doesn\u2019t take \u201chopping\u201d on and off into account. The Bendezu work is much more convincing, because the shape of the cell permits bleaching of a larger area and GDP\u2212Cdc42 diffuses much more rapidly in the membrane so the measurement is not confounded by the relatively slower exchange (which unlike Marco they do incorporate in generating their fits). But, as they point out, their measurement refers only to GDP\u2212Cdc42:GTP\u2212Cdc42 diffusion was too slow to measure. Of course, there is also no guarantee that the two yeasts would necessarily have a similar diffusion environment as their cell walls are quite different. The relevant (slow) diffusion constant in our model applies to GTP\u2212Cdc42, since GDP\u2212Cdc42 already has high mobility due to its ability to exchange into the cytoplasm. We admit that we do not have a valid measure for this, but we note that no model with rapid diffusion of GTP\u2212Cdc42 would be able to explain how polarity sites in such close proximity (e.g. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C, D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> cell 2, or especially <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> cell 2) could avoid merging together.

Mutants that reduce negative feedback considerably (<i>CDC24</i><sup>38A</sup>) still show competition, with dynamics similar to wild\u2212type (Kuo et al. 2014). In addition, we now show that mutants with reduced negative feedback still generate two\u2212budded cells when exchange of Cdc42 is slowed (new <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Thus, we believe that negative feedback is unlikely to be central to the process of competition. We also note that a similarly\u2212parameterized model that includes negative feedback displays competition behavior that looks quite similar to that in the model lacking negative feedback (<a href=\"#fig14\">Author response image 2</a>)."

The simulations were initiated with identical perturbations on two sites and followed what steady state is reached. To further validate the limiting factor idea it would be interesting to test what happens as the cells grow. There are several papers (by Crampin and Maini) on the behaviour of the Turing pattern in growing domains. I was wondering how the proposed model would behave if growth is considered.</i> "

For Bem1-CAAX, the anchor-away experiment is convincing and indeed shows that Bem1-CAAX is mobile on and off the membrane. I would suggest that, in the flow of the paper, it would be better to describe this at the top of the Bem1-CAAX allele description as a way of introducing it as a tool to reduce exchange dynamics, rather than at the end. The conclusions made in the fourth paragraph of the subsection \u201cTesting the competition model: reducing polarity protein\u201d would then be more straightforward. In these lines, I would also suggest rephrasing the meaning of FLIP and FRAP quantification, as these do not directly show membrane-cytosol exchange dynamics, because lateral diffusion will also be a contributing factor. The proposed re-organization would also help in understanding the next paragraph, in which the logical link between the slowed membrane-cytosol exchange of prenylated protein and the previous analysis of Cdc42 dynamics is not entirely clear.</i> "

The nuclear membrane is connected to the ER, and it is possible that the relocation occurs as Cdc24-CAAX remains bound to the membrane rather than transit through the cytosol. Thus, the manuscript has been significantly improved and now convincingly shows that Bem1-CAAX shuttles between membrane and cytosol, but the same level of confidence does not apply to Cdc24-CAAX, as it would be predicted to be nuclear, rather than at the nuclear periphery in haploids if that were the case. I would feel much more comfortable if the data was confirmed using an alternative mode of binding these proteins (or at least Cdc24) peripherally to the plasma membrane, for instance through an amphipathic helix, a C2 or a PH domain.</i> "

These are thought to provide very weak but essential membrane binding domains (Takahashi and Pryciak, 2008., Mol Biol Cell 18: 4945-4956).
