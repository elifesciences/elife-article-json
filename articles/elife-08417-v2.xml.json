We examined cell populations in macaque area V4 during a rapid form of perceptual learning that emerges within tens of minutes. Multiple single units and LFP responses were recorded as monkeys improved their performance in an image discrimination task. We show that the increase in behavioral performance during learning is predicted by a tight coordination of spike timing with local population activity. More spike-LFP theta synchronization is correlated with higher learning performance, while high-frequency synchronization is unrelated with changes in performance, but these changes were absent once learning had stabilized and stimuli became familiar, or in the absence of learning. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of plasticity in visual cortex by which elevated low-frequency synchronization between individual neurons and local population activity accompanies the improvement in performance during learning."

Thus, behavioral performance in visual, auditory, or motor tasks (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sparks et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Georgopoulos et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lee et al., 1988</a>) is known to be much more accurate than would be predicted from the responses of single neurons (<a href=\"#bib28\">Paradiso, 1988</a>).

Second, we computed SFC by dividing the power spectrum of the STA to the average of all power spectra of the LFP segments used to obtain the STA. SFC varies as a function of frequency and yields values between 0 and 1. The larger the SFC, the more accurately the spikes follow a particular phase of this frequency.

In addition, since neurons have different strengths of their stimulus onset transients, and the SFC measure is sensitive to spike counts, focusing the analysis on the period immediately following stimulus presentation might contaminate our measure of spike-LFP synchronization. We thus computed the mean SFC values (across all pairs and sessions) and found that whereas SFC in the higher frequency bands showed no significant change across blocks (Kruskal\u2013Wallis, p &gt; 0.2), theta-band SFC was significantly increased during the time course of learning (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; n = 625 pairs, comparing blocks 2\u20134 with block 1, Kruskal\u2013Wallis, p &lt; 10<sup>\u22127</sup>). <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> shows the distribution of SFC values for all the pairs in our population and reveals that learning is accompanied by a pronounced increase in theta SFC in blocks 2\u20134 relative to block 1 (p &lt; 0.05, t-test).

The increase in theta SFC during learning was statistically significant in both animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, p &lt; 0.001, Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, post hoc analysis)."

For instance, while the theta power is constant across blocks, the power in other bands declines somewhat (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). In addition, the sensitivity of the coherence results may be related to the number of action potentials falling within a period at each frequency. However, this is not an issue in our analysis. The STAs used in the calculation of SFC is measured by summing all LFP segments and then dividing by the number of spikes. Even though the power spectrum of the STA depends on the power spectrum of the LFP signal (decreasing LFP amplitude decreases the STA power despite the absence of spike-LFP synchronization), SFC is obtained by normalizing the power spectrum of the STA by the average of all power spectra of all LFP segments that were averaged to obtain the STA. This normalization ensures that SFC is independent of the spiking rates and the power spectrum of the LFP. Thus, the small block-by-block changes in LFP power in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) are unlikely to alter the sensitivity of our SFC measure during learning in the corresponding frequency band."

However, as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, the increase in theta SFC is unrelated to stimulus presentation (although only theta SFC is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, we did not find statistically significant block-by-block changes in SFC in any frequency band, p &gt; 0.05, ANOVA test). We also separated our spike-LFP coherence analysis for the pairs originating from different electrodes and pairs originating from the same or different electrodes. However, although the increase in theta SFC during learning was slightly larger when the spike-LFP pairs were taken from different electrodes (n = 523 pairs), the effects were highly significant in both cases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, Kruskal\u2013Wallis test).

We subsequently computed the z-scores of SFC values in each block (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jarvis and Mitra, 2001</a>) by computing the distribution of coherence under null hypothesis given the number of degrees of freedom (i.e. the number of spikes * number of tapers), then calculating how many standard deviations the observed coherence differs from zero. The z-score eliminated the bias due to low-firing rates and the small sample size. We found that even when we compared the z-scored coherence values, theta SFC was still significantly elevated after block 1 (p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), whereas the z-score coherence in the other frequency bands either showed no change (in alpha and beta bands, p &gt; 0.1) or decreased only slightly in the gamma band (p &lt; 0.01).

This raises the possibility that the increase in spike-LFP theta coherence may only be required during the development of learning, but not after the behavioral threshold has reached the asymptote (following block 2).

The spike-LFP synchronization associated with learning occurred in the theta band, while higher frequency synchronization was uncorrelated with changes in behavioral performance. Importantly, the changes in spike-LFP theta synchronization only characterized the learning of novel stimuli but were absent once stimuli became familiar or in situations when learning did not occur. These findings indicate that plasticity in visual cortex during the time course of learning is accompanied by elevated low-frequency synchronization between individual neuron responses and local population activity. Additionally, there was a significant increase in spike-LFP phase locking strength in the theta band during learning despite the fact that theta LFP power remained constant. Although our study reports neuronal changes associated with a rapid form of learning, it is possible that the improvement in behavioral performance occurring over larger time scales (e.g., weeks) may be accompanied by similar changes in spike-LFP theta synchronization."

Indeed, synaptic plasticity has been associated with coordinated action-potential timing across neuronal networks and oscillations of specific frequencies. In particular, neuronal oscillations in the theta frequency range (3\u20138 Hz) have been associated with the induction of synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buzsaki, 2002</a>). For instance, the timing between incoming stimuli and ongoing theta oscillations controls synaptic changes. In addition, oscillations in the theta range can be modulated by behavior and brain state (<a href=\"#bib40\">Winson, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hasselmo et al., 2002</a>) and have been assigned a key role in the maintenance of information in short-term memory (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lee et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Liebe et al., 2012</a>). Although our study did not reveal an ongoing theta oscillation for the population activity, we demonstrate that the timing of neuronal spikes relative to the theta-filtered LFP activity during a rapid form of visual learning is correlated with the increase in behavioral performance. Our results are consistent with previous evidence in rabbit hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berry and Thompson, 1978</a>) that animals that exhibit more theta activity show elevated classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane response."

To rule out this possibility, we examined the block-by-block changes in behavioral performance in the match trials (these trials require a bar release response). If monkey's strategy was to keep holding the lever as the session progressed, performance in the match trials (randomly interleaved with the non-match trials) would significantly deteriorate. However, we did not find statistically significant changes in match (bar release) responses across blocks of trials (by analyzing all the sessions with an improvement in learning performance, p &gt; 0.1; ANOVA test). Another possibility that could explain our behavioral results is that the poorer performance at the beginning of the session (in block 1) may be due to animals being distracted by the novelty of stimulus presentation. To rule out this concern, we performed additional behavioral experiments (Monkey 2, n = 10 sessions) in which the animal was passively exposed to a novel natural scene while he performed a color detection task (red\u2013green task) in the contralateral hemifield (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). After 150 trials of passive (inattentive) exposure to the novel image, the monkey was switched to the image discrimination task (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

For instance, theta synchronization was associated with pattern recognition, working memory, sequence learning and navigation, most prominent in the temporal lobe (<a href=\"#bib39\">von Stein et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lengyel et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Rutishauser et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hoerzer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Benchenane et al., 2010</a>). It also has been suggested that low-frequency synchronization is suitable for long-range or polysynaptic communication across distant brain areas (<a href=\"#bib39\">von Stein et al., 2000</a>). One possibility is that visual cortical neurons are coordinated with the theta rhythm in higher cortical areas, for example, activation of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area or those in prefrontal cortex influences theta phase-locking of neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Benchenane et al., 2010</a>). Both of these types of neurons can be activated by novel stimuli, similar to those used in our experiments. In addition, theta synchronization within and between V4 and prefrontal cortex has been reported during the maintenance of visual short-term memory (<a href=\"#bib31\">Raghavachari et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Liebe et al., 2012</a>).

Stimuli were presented on a CRT color monitor (Dell, Texas, United States, 60-Hz refresh rate, running MATLAB and using Psychophysics Toolbox), positioned 57 cm in the front of the animal. After monkeys triggered the trial by holding a bar, a small spot (0.1 deg) was presented in the center of monitor. Monkeys were required to hold fixation within a 1-deg diameter window throughout stimulus presentation; the trial was automatically aborted if fixation instability (microsaccade amplitude) exceeded 0.25 deg at any time during stimulus presentation. All natural scenes were converted to equal-contrast gray scale circular images of 5 deg in diameter. After 500 ms of fixation, a target image was flashed for 300 ms. After a 1000-ms blank, a 300-ms test stimulus of random orientation (rotated with respect to the target image by 0, 3, 5, 10, or 20\u00b0) was flashed at the same visual location. The monkey was required to hold the bar for 1.5 s if the target and test stimuli were different and release the bar within 1.5 s if they are identical. The monkey was rewarded with 5 drops of juice for the correct choice. A full session consisted of 4 consecutive blocks of 96 trials each. Test image orientation was randomized across trials in each block (each block was randomly composed by 48 match 12 non-match trials for each image orientation). Psychometric curves were obtained in each session. We averaged the percentage correct responses for each orientation difference between target and test. The probability of false alarms (which is the value obtained for the 0<sup>o</sup> orientation difference) represents the proportion of match trials in which the monkey's response was incorrect. The psychometric curves represent the best fit of the data using Weibull functions: <i>P(\u0394\u03b8)=1</i>\u2212<i>(1</i>\u2212<i>FA) exp</i> \u2212<i>(\u0394\u03b8 /a)</i><sup><i>b</i></sup>, where <i>FA</i> is the false alarm rate, and <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the offset and slope terms of the best Weibull fit.

LFPs were further filtered between 0.5 Hz and 100 Hz using a fourth order Butterworth filter.

All filtering was applied by using forward and backwards filtering to obtain zero phase shifts. We discarded all LFPs that had more than 3 points outside the mean \u00b14 standard deviations to avoid influence of irregular artifact noise from muscle activity or other sources. The amplitude of LFPs was measured in each trial by standard deviation, peak-valley amplitude, and average voltage for specific periods of interest. We estimated the LFP power density during the presentation of the stimuli using sliding windows of \u00b1150-ms length in steps of 10 ms. In order to obtain optimal spectral concentration, we used the multitaper method by multiplying each data epoch with the tapers before Fourier transforming (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mitra and Pesaran, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jarvis and Mitra, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Pesaran et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Womelsdorf et al., 2006</a>).

For our analysis, we applied spectral smoothing of TW = 4, K = 7 tapers for frequencies greater than 30 Hz and a single Hanning taper for lower frequencies. The power spectral density was first normalized to the average power spectrum during the 300-ms fixation period before the presentation of the target stimulus (averaged across all trials in a session). This helped balance the power spectrum between low and high frequencies within same amplitude range. The average power of theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands was calculated as the mean power at frequencies between 5 and \u223c7 Hz, 8\u201313 Hz, 15\u201330 Hz, 35\u201380 Hz.

The 300-ms window enables us to measure the spectrum of the STA over entire theta frequency range. To quantify STA, we calculate its power spectrum (i.e. the magnitude of all frequency components of the STA as a function of frequency).

The LFP signal was filtered in the theta band by an equiripple FIR filter (band edge 3.5\u20134 Hz, 8\u20138.5 Hz, attenuation 40 dB, 1 ripple). Similar filtering was applied for other frequency bands (alpha 7\u20138 Hz, 14\u201315 Hz; beta 13\u201314 Hz, 30\u201331.5 Hz; gamma 28\u201330 Hz, 80\u201382 Hz). The filtered data were subsequently Hilbert transformed. The phase at each time was defined as the angle of the Hilbert complex. We analyzed the distribution of phase angles at each spike time within 150\u2013350 ms after stimulus onset. Circular statistical analysis was performed using the Matlab CircStat toolbox. The significance of phase angle distribution non-uniformity was assessed by Rayleigh's and Omnibus tests at both individual pair and population level. Rayleigh's Z score is a measurement of the strength of non-uniform circular distribution. It was defined as the square of vector sum of all sample angles divided by the sample size. The difference in phase distribution was assessed for statistical significance by using the non-parametric circ_cmtest through all blocks and then Kuiper test between block pairs. To verify that the phase locking between spikes and LFPs in the theta band was not due to the stimulus itself, we calculated the theta phase of shuffled control. It was performed by shuffling the trials of LFP data to match original spike trains. Each trial was sampled once. We calculated the Rayleigh's Z value of shuffled spike-LFP phase. The median of 100 different reshuffle was considered as the shuffled Z value."

This is important because many forms of perceptual learning do take place in V1, raising the possibility that observation in V4 are secondary to other changes occurring at earlier stages of perception. Perhaps the reason for choosing V4 is obvious, but it needs to be stated."

This normalization ensures that SFC is independent of the spiking rates and the power spectrum of the LFP. Thus, the small block-by-block changes in LFP power in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands (<a href=\"#fig1\">s 1H</a>) are unlikely to alter the sensitivity of our SFC measure during learning in the corresponding frequency band.

(ii) Oscillations in the theta range can be modulated by behavior and brain state (<a href=\"#bib40\">Winson, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hasselmo et al., 2002</a>) and have been assigned a key role in the maintenance of information in short-term memory (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lee et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Liebe et al., 2012</a>).

The significance is high as it shifts the emphasis from the single unit level to the population level. The data and analysis seems convincing (although I am an expert in this type of quantitative approaches). I have only one general consideration to raise, that the rationale for doing the studies in V4 is not clear. This is important because many forms of perceptual learning do take place in V1, raising the possibility that observation in V4 are secondary to other changes occurring at earlier stages of perception. Perhaps the reason for choosing V4 is obvious, but it needs to be stated</i>."

To address the reviewer\u2019s criticism we added a new paragraph (the last paragraph in the Introduction section) that describes the reasons for focusing our study on area V4: (i) among all sensory cortical areas, the visual cortex is the best understood in terms of receptive field properties and circuitry, thus it provides a unique opportunity for investigating the impact of perceptual learning on neuronal responses, (ii) area V4, unlike V1, sends inputs to downstream areas involved in perceptual decisions, (iii) individual neuron responses in extrastriate cortex (such as V4) are more strongly correlated to behavior than those in V1, and (iv) previous lesion studies have suggested that area V4 plays a key role in perceptual learning (without demonstrating what that role is)."
