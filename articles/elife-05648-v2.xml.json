Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Our systems-level analyses identified a duration code that instructs stimulus specific crosstalk between TLR4-activated canonical NF-\u03baB pathway and lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R) induced non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling. Indeed, LT\u03b2R costimulation synergistically enhanced the late RelA/NF-\u03baB response to TLR4 prolonging NF-\u03baB target gene-expressions. Concomitant LT\u03b2R signal targeted TLR4-induced newly synthesized p100, encoded by <i>Nfkb2</i>, for processing into p52 that not only neutralized p100 mediated inhibitions, but potently generated RelA:p52/NF-\u03baB activity in a positive feedback loop. Finally, <i>Nfkb2</i> connected lymphotoxin signal within the intestinal niche in reinforcing epithelial innate inflammatory RelA/NF-\u03baB response to <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> infection, while <i>Nfkb2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice succumbed to gut infections owing to stromal defects. In sum, our results suggest that signal integration via the pleiotropic NF-\u03baB system enables tissue microenvironment derived cues in calibrating physiological responses."

Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Our systems-level analyses identified a duration code that instructs stimulus specific crosstalk between TLR4-activated canonical NF-\u03baB pathway and lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R) induced non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling. Indeed, LT\u03b2R costimulation synergistically enhanced the late RelA/NF-\u03baB response to TLR4 prolonging NF-\u03baB target gene-expressions. Concomitant LT\u03b2R signal targeted TLR4-induced newly synthesized p100, encoded by <i>Nfkb2</i>, for processing into p52 that not only neutralized p100 mediated inhibitions, but potently generated RelA:p52/NF-\u03baB activity in a positive feedback loop. Finally, <i>Nfkb2</i> connected lymphotoxin signal within the intestinal niche in reinforcing epithelial innate inflammatory RelA/NF-\u03baB response to <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> infection, while <i>Nfkb2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice succumbed to gut infections owing to stromal defects. In sum, our results suggest that signal integration via the pleiotropic NF-\u03baB system enables tissue microenvironment derived cues in calibrating physiological responses."

Innate immune cells are found in every tissue type, poised to respond immediately to damaged, stressed, or infected host cells. When innate immune cells recognize any injury or infection, one of the first things they do is trigger the inflammatory response. Fluid and other immune cells then move from the blood into the injured tissues. This movement can cause redness and swelling. But the response helps to establish a physical barrier against the spread of infection, promotes the elimination of both invading microbes and damaged host cells, and encourages the repair of the tissue."

Further experiments confirmed the importance of this signal integration by showing how a signal coming from intestinal tissue can influence the activity of innate immune cells and inflammation in the gut."

Tissue-resident cells those that participate in inflammatory immune activation also exhibit functional differences by adapting to the repertoire of cell-differentiating cues present in distinct microenvironments. Indeed, macrophages and dendritic cells present in different anatomic niche display heterogeneity in inflammatory signatures (<a href=\"#bib15\">Iwasaki and Kelsall, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Stout and Suttles, 2004</a>). Likewise, a requirement for CD40, primarily involved in B-cell maturation, in inflammatory gene expressions in endothelial cells was documented (<a href=\"#bib23\">Pluvinet et al., 2008</a>). Similarly, lymph node inducing lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R) was shown to be critical for innate immune responses (<a href=\"#bib31\">Spahn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2010</a>).

In the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway, inflammatory cues engage NEMO-IKK2 (NEMO-IKK\u03b2) kinase complex to phosphorylate inhibitory I\u03baB proteins, the major isoform being I\u03baB\u03b1, bound to the cytoplasmic RelA:p50 NF-\u03baB dimers. Signal-induced phosphorylation leads to proteasomal degradation of I\u03baBs and release of RelA:p50 dimers into the nucleus. The nuclear RelA dimers activate the expressions of pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine genes as well as its own inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1, which ensures proper attenuation of inflammatory responses in a negative feedback loop. In contrast to canonical signaling, the non-canonical pathway transduces signals from cell-differentiating cues those engage BAFFR, CD40, or LT\u03b2R. Non-canonical signaling involves NIK and IKK1 (NIK-IKK\u03b1) mediated phosphorylation of <i>Nfkb2</i> encoded precursor p100 bound to RelB (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sun, 2012</a>). Subsequent proteasomal processing removes the C-terminal inhibitory domain of p100 from RelB:p100 complex to generate RelB:p52 NF-\u03baB dimer, which mediates the expressions of organogenic chemokine genes in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bonizzi et al., 2004</a>)."

LT\u03b2R through non-canonical NIK-IKK1 signal inactivates I\u03baB\u03b4 to induce a weak yet sustained RelA:p50 activity. Conversely, RelA-induced synthesis of p100 and consequent accumulation of inhibitory I\u03baB\u03b4 was shown to exert negative feedback limiting canonical RelA activity (<a href=\"#bib8\">de Wit et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Legarda-Addison and Ting, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Shih et al., 2009</a>). In addition, an alternate RelA:p52 dimer has been reported which is thought to constitute a minor kappaB DNA binding activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hoffmann et al., 2003</a>). Crosstalk between apparently distinct cell signaling pathways is known to offer diversity in cellular responses.

Finally, we established the physiological significance of crosstalk control of RelA in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), where, the NF-\u03baB system integrates gut microenvironment derived lymphotoxin signals through <i>Nfkb2</i> to calibrate innate immune responses to <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i>."

Mathematical reconstruction of dynamic networks illuminates emergent properties, such as crosstalk (<a href=\"#bib4\">Basak et al., 2012</a>). To explore crosstalk control, we developed a mathematical model, which we termed the NF-\u03baB Systems Model <i>v</i>1.0 (<a href=\"#app1\">Appendix-1</a>), basing on previously published single NF-\u03baB dimer model versions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hoffmann et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Basak et al., 2007</a>). In our mathematical model, however, we depicted nuclear activation of both the major RelA:p50 dimer and RelA:p52 dimer, which is thought to constitute a minor RelA NF-\u03baB activity. As described in the preceding single dimer models (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hoffmann et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Basak et al., 2007</a>), signal-responsive degradation and resynthesis of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b5, and inhibitory p100/I\u03baB\u03b4 dynamically controlled RelA activity.

Simulating individual TNFR or LT\u03b2R regime, we could recapitulate experimentally observed strong, but temporally controlled, activation of RelA NF-\u03baB complexes during canonical IKK2 signaling or the weak induction of RelA dimers during non-canonical NIK-IKK1 signaling, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

IL-1R signal, in parallel to transient IKK2 activation, elicited strong RelA activity at 30 min in EMSA that was largely attenuated within 1 hr, whereas, non-canonical LT\u03b2R signal only weakly induced RelA and RelB dimers those persisted even at 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Indeed, we were unable to detect any significant enhancement of RelA activity, relative to IL-1 induced peak, upon costimulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In comparison, canonical TLR4 induced a temporally distinct RelA NF-\u03baB activity with an early peak at 1 hr, subsequent descend and a progressively weakened late phase between 8 hr and 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Corroborating our mathematical prediction, concomitant LT\u03b2R signal sustained NF-\u03baB response triggered by TLR4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Signal integration via the NF-\u03baB system synergistically enhanced TLR4-induced late RelA activity at 24 hr in the costimulation regime with mostly unaltered RelB response relative to solitary LT\u03b2R engagement (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, quantification and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Sequentially engaging MyD88 and Trif, TLR4 was shown to produce extended IKK2 activity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Covert et al., 2005</a>). To determine if the observed stimulus specificity of crosstalk is indeed due to the duration of IKK2, we utilized Trif-deficient MEFs that only transiently activated IKK2 upon LPS treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Despite a functional non-canonical pathway (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), LT\u03b2R was restricted from crosstalk with TLR4 in Trif-deficient cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), thereby, suggesting a Trif-dependent mechanism that relies on the duration of canonical IKK2 in imparting stimulus specificity of crosstalk control."

Concomitant LT\u03b2R signal instead utilized TLR4-induced, newly synthesized p100 to potently generate p52, thereby, neutralizing the inhibitory p100 function (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). p50 levels were not discernibly altered in these stimulation regimes in our experiments. Our immunoprecipitation based analysis demonstrated that NIK-IKK1 signal relieves RelA from p100/I\u03baB\u03b4-mediated inhibition during crosstalk (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Intriguingly, LT\u03b2R costimulation of MEFs for 24 hr also produced \u223cfourfold more RelA:p52 NF-\u03baB dimer as compared to solitary LPS treatments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Limited transcriptional up-regulation of <i>Nfkb2</i> by weak LT\u03b2R signal was correlated with only the modest p52 and RelA:p52 generation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). In supershift assay, we could ascertain that RelA:p52 dimer generated upon LT\u03b2R costimulation appears as a strong nuclear DNA binding activity at 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) to supplement to the TLR4-induced RelA NF-\u03baB responses. An important role of dimerization in stabilizing NF-\u03baB monomers from degradation has been reported earlier (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fusco et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, RelA protein rapidly accumulated in cells upon proteasome inhibition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) suggesting a robust constitutive degradation mechanism that offsets basal synthesis of RelA monomers in maintaining the steady-state level. Our study indicated that this enduring flux ensures copious supply of RelA to bind to de novo generated p52, produced from the newly synthesized p100 during crosstalk."

Although, the crosstalk effect on MIP-1\u03b1 expressions was somewhat muted owing to prolonged expression of this gene in <i>Relb</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs in response to solitary LPS treatment. Therefore, our analyses confirmed that the precursor function encoded by <i>Nfkb2</i> in generating RelA:p52 NF-\u03baB dimer is critical for integrating lymphotoxin derived signals to the pro-inflammatory RelA NF-\u03baB pathway. Our analyses also suggested that LT\u03b2R costimulation led to the hyperactivation of LPS-induced expressions of chemokine and cytokine genes in an <i>Nfkb2</i>-dependent manner with only a minor, if any, role for <i>Relb</i>."

As opposed to rapid expression of <i>Nfkbia</i> mRNA, which encodes I\u03baB\u03b1, LPS induced <i>Nfkb2</i> mRNA with a delay (top panel, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Similarly, chronic TNF treatment induced <i>Nfkb2</i> mRNA in WT MEFs with an explicit 1 hr delay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) that was also observed earlier and incorporated in both the previous (<a href=\"#bib3\">Basak et al., 2007</a>) as well as the current mathematical model versions. Analogous time lags were observed in the expression of several inflammatory genes those require additional chromatin modifications for the initiation of RelA-induced transcription (<a href=\"#bib22\">Natoli et al., 2005</a>). When <i>Nfkb2</i> transgene was stably expressed in <i>Nfkb2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs from an exogenous NF-\u03baB responsive promoter, <i>Nfkb2</i> mRNA was readily induced by TNF without a delay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Remarkably, IL-1 treatment was ineffective in activating the expression of <i>Nfkb2</i> mRNA in WT MEFs, despite the early induction of <i>Nfkbia</i> (bottom, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Only upon eliminating the transcriptional delay, our mathematical model could simulate <i>Nfkb2</i> mRNA induction by IL-1 treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Indeed, we could also experimentally rescue the defect in <i>Nfkb2</i> mRNA induction by IL-1 treatment in the engineered <i>Nfkb2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cell line, which expresses <i>Nfkb2</i> transgene from the NF-\u03baB-responsive promoter without the delay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

Our studies also explained the requirement for the long-duration NIK-IKK1 signals in targeting this late acting p100 <i>Nfkb2</i> feedback for RelA:p52 dimer generation.

Our inability to rescue the infection-related mortality in <i>Nfkb2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice using WT hematopoietic cells indicated that the protective function of <i>Nfkb2</i> lies within stromal cells.

                        "text": "The NF-\u03baB system transduces signals from a variety of cell-activating stimuli. Our study suggested that such pleiotropic system enables tuning of cellular response to an instructive signal by microenvironment-derived additional costimulatory signals. However, a duration code selectively integrates costimulatory LT\u03b2R signal with the TLR4 pathway, insulating transient cytokine signaling, secondary to microbial infections, from crosstalk amplifications. Recent studies have identified important positive feedback regulations underlying dose threshold control of NF-\u03baB response in B-cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Shinohara et al., 2014</a>) or in myeloid cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sung et al., 2014</a>). Our crosstalk study illuminated a role of a positive feedback loop in sustaining NF-\u03baB response; where non-canonical LT\u03b2R signal prolonged canonical TLR4 response by targeting RelA induced p100 for the generation of RelA:p52 NF-\u03baB dimer. Indeed, a dominant precursor function of p100 in producing RelA:p52 led to ablated crosstalk in <i>Nfkb2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells. As such, non-canonical signal generates RelB:p52 by removing the C-terminal domain of p100 present in the preexisting RelB:p100 dimeric complex (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sun, 2012</a>) or liberates RelA:p50 dimer from the p100/I\u03baB\u03b4-inhibited complexes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Basak et al., 2007</a>). Signal generation of the RelA:p52 dimer requires both canonical induction of p100/<i>Nfkb2</i> expressions and concomitant processing of the newly synthesized p100 into p52 by non-canonical signal. Previous report demonstrating that p100 could be efficiently processed cotranslationally (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mordm\u00fcller et al., 2003</a>) explained the requirement of canonical signals in amply synthesizing nascent p100 as a substrate for the abundant production of p52 subunit during crosstalk. More so, mature p52 could readily dimerize with RelA, despite a preference of full-length p100 for RelB binding (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fusco et al., 2008</a>). These observations along with our current study, thereby, elaborated a requirement of convergence of canonical and non-canonical signals in synergistically generating and activating RelA:p52 dimer. Nevertheless, consistent to the observed gene-effect of crosstalk in our study, a significant overlap between RelA:p50 and RelA:p52 dimers in DNA binding (<a href=\"#bib29\">Siggers et al., 2012</a>) and pro-inflammatory gene expressions (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hoffmann et al., 2003</a>) was reported earlier. Of note, our results rely on bulk measurements of signaling intermediates and deterministic modeling approaches. Given studies documenting cell-to-cell variations in signal-induced NF-\u03baB responses (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lee et al., 2009</a>), it would be interesting to examine the potential implication of signal integration at the single cell level in determining cellular heterogeneity."

Yet, epithelial LT\u03b2R (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2010</a>) was also important for effective innate immune responses to <i>Citrobacter</i>. In our proposed model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I</a>), we could clarify that LT\u03b2R provides a critical costimulatory signal through <i>Nfkb2</i> to sustain RelA NF-\u03baB response to pathogens in otherwise hyporesponsive colonic epithelial cells. Such signal integration ameliorated innate immune functions by enhancing pro-inflammatory gene expressions. Interestingly, p100<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice, which lacked the expression of p100, but aberrantly produced p52, revealed hyperplasia of gastric epithelial cells and elevated expressions of RelA target genes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ishikawa et al., 1997</a>). In <i>Nlrp12</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, robust p52 generation in stromal cells through the non-canonical pathway led to colon cancer associated inflammation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2012</a>), a hallmark for aberrant RelA activity. These studies indeed support a possible role of <i>Nfkb2</i> in mucosal epithelial cells in strengthening RelA activity. LT\u03b2R engagement in the dendritic cells within colonic patches was shown to trigger IL-22 production by innate lymphoid cells involving cell\u2013cell communications to potentiate gut immunity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tumanov et al., 2011</a>). Although, a defect in the colonic patches in <i>Nfkb2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice could impair IL-22 mediated protective responses, our cell-intrinsic crosstalk model explained that the reported epithelial requirement of LT\u03b2R (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wang et al., 2010</a>) is in sustaining RelA NF-\u03baB response during bacterial infection. In future, tissue-specific knockouts may help to further distinguish between innate immune functions of <i>Nfkb2</i> in different cell types."

Future studies ought to further examine the signal integration via <i>Nfkb2</i> in potentiating immune responses against other microbial pathogens. More so, the potential involvement of the deregulated crosstalk control in the pathophysiology of inflammatory disorders, particularly those involving gut, remains to be addressed."

In the preceding version, canonical IKK2 signals degraded classical I\u03baBs, while non-canonical NIK-IKK1 targeted I\u03baB\u03b4 to liberate the RelA:p50 NF-\u03baB dimers, represented as a singular species, into the nucleus. Although, biochemical analyses defined I\u03baB\u03b4 as an oligomer of p100, the previous versions represented I\u03baB\u03b4 as a composite species that is produced directly from an NF-\u03baB responsive gene. In the current version, we have elaborated biochemical reactions associated with p100 in the model. We have explicitly described p100 as a species that is generated from the transcripts encoded by NF-\u03baB responsive <i>Nfkb2</i>. Monomer p100 was subjected to (i) constitutive degradation or (ii) oligomerization to form I\u03baB\u03b4 or (iii) NIK-IKK1-dependent processing that generated RelA:p52 dimer as a composite species. In contrast, RelA:p50 dimer was constitutively produced as a singular species. As described in the preceding single dimer model, the activation dynamics of these two RelA NF-\u03baB dimers was coordinately regulated by signal responsive degradation and resynthesis of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b5, and I\u03baB\u03b4 during inflammatory signaling. The newly built model consists of 34 species, 138 reactions with 105 parameters; those describe the synthesis and degradation of NF-\u03baB and I\u03baBs, association and dissociation of I\u03baB:NF-\u03baB complexes, nuclear import and export of NF-\u03baB and I\u03baB species as well as processing of p100 (see a detailed wiring in <a href=\"#fig8\">Appendix figure 1</a>). Constrains generated based on our quantitative biochemical analyses (<a href=\"#fig9\">Appendix figures 2\u20134</a>) was used along with published literature and fitting procedures for parameterizing the model (see the description of the parameters in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary files 1, 2</a>).

The abundance of unbound NF-\u03baB dimers was then scored using EMSA. Incubation with 25 nM I\u03baB\u03b1 was sufficient to completely inhibit RelA:p50 DNA binding. While, more than 200 nM of I\u03baB\u03b1 was required to inhibit RelA:p52 and RelA:RelA DNA binding, owing to weaker I\u03baB\u03b1 binding by these dimers. The data represents three experimental replicates."

The transcriptional delay function has been executed in the Systems Model v1.0 as follows: for an explicit delay of t1 min, a given NF-\u03baB dependent transcription reaction assumes a NF-\u03baB concentration at basal level up to t1 min. Subsequently, nuclear concentration of NF-\u03baB has been used as such from (t1 + \u0394t1) min and onwards for computing transcription rates. As previously described, an equilibrium phase was introduced prior to the onset of stimulation phase (<a href=\"#bib3\">Basak et al., 2007</a>).

As LPS signaling to NF-kB proceeds through the canonical pathway and leads to p50:RelA and p50:c-Rel complexes, while LT\u03b2R signaling proceeds through NIK-IKK1 to promote processing of p100 to p52, which then associates with RelB (or is preassociated with it) to form activating p52:RelB dimers, the demonstration that LT\u03b2R-induced p52:RelA enhances the canonical pathway, is interesting. As the activation phase of the canonical NF-kB activity is determined by negative feedback through newly synthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 and I\u03baB\u03b4 (as well as molecules such as A20), the ability of LT\u03b2R signaling to somehow overcome the observed reduction of canonical NF-kB activity, is also an interesting observation. Some of the data presented are indeed exciting, as is the progression of analysis from computational models to physiology."

Yet, none of these short-duration IKK2 activities engaged into signaling crosstalk as reflected in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> (top panel). In <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2B</a>, we have further verified our claim by using representative short-duration NEMO-IKK2 inputs. Although, the duration threshold for NEMO-IKK2 was somewhat less elaborate as compared to NIK-IKK1, which exhibited a duration threshold of \u223c 8h (bottom panel, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We suspect that this difference may have attributed to the undesired confusion undermining NEMO-IKK2 duration control. Notably, this rather narrow time scale in the NEMO-IKK2 duration threshold was effective in discriminating between IL-1R and TLR4 signaling with respect to crosstalk. In the revised text, we have further restructured the pertinent section to highlight the differences between NEMO-IKK2 and NIK-IKK1 activities in the quantum of the duration threshold (in the subsection headed \u201cA duration code controlling crosstalk between canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling\u201d)."

In the revised draft, instead we have presented the simulation data for total nuclear RelA/NF-\u03baB activity in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. We agree that such distinction is largely peripheral for confirming the effectiveness of the mathematical model.

In the revised text, we have now restructured the relevant sentence (in the subsection headed \u201cA duration code controlling crosstalk between canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling\u201d) to omit the section unnecessarily emphasizing on TNF autocrine.

We have provided a detailed description of the gene-expression analyses those include methodologies used for estimating crosstalk scores (included in the Materials and methods in the main text in the revised draft), crosstalk scores of the individual genes (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2013source data 1</a> in the revised draft) as well as identity of the genes belonging to the NF- \u03baB target gene set used for GSEA (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2013source data 2</a> in the revised draft). As indicated by the reviewers, we have also noted that several genes were actually downregulated in the costimulation regime. But specific enrichment of NF-\u03baB targets among the hyper-induced genes in GSEA conversely validated that these downregulated genes were less likely to be NF-\u03baB targets. TLR4 signaling, however, activates multiple other transcription factors those include members of ATF, IRF as well as STAT family. At this point, it remains unclear to us if the observed downregulation of gene-expressions is attributed by any of these transcription factors. Owing to a lack of bona fide target gene sets validated through experimental analyses, we were unable to further test the possible engagement of other transcription factors in GSEA. Instead restricting the scope of our conclusion, we could narrowly infer that the augmented RelA NF-\u03baB activity observed in the nucleus in the costimulation regime leads to heightened NF-\u03baB dependent gene-expressions. We have also performed quantitative RT-PCR analyses confirming heightened expressions of several NF-\u03baB target chemokine/cytokine genes in the costimulation regime."

We assume that the reviewers may have enquired about the possible engagement of RelB:p52 complexes, which is generated independent of crosstalk regulations, in pathogen response. Using colon derived MSIE cells, we could show that solitary LT\u03b2R stimulation only weakly activates NF-\u03baB signaling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). But as a co-stimulus, LT\u03b2R signal significantly augmented TLR4 induced RelA activity in these intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, our supershift analyses clearly demonstrated a complete absence of RelB DNA binding complexes in the enterocytes derived from infected WT mice. Given the importance of the question, we have repeated the supershift analyses and incorporated the supershift data in the revised main text in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> revealing that nuclear NF-\u03baB activity is exclusively composed of RelA dimers in IECs. Our additional experiments also revealed considerable nuclear accumulation of RelA:p52 dimer along with RelA:p50 in the enterocytes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>). Taken together, these results suggested that the observed defect in the innate immune response to Citrobacter infection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) in <i>Nfkb2</i><sup><i>- /-</i></sup> mice unlikely involve epithelial RelB activity. Notably, our analyses also confirmed a critical requirement of <i>Nfkb2</i> in the non-hematopoietic cells in imparting resilience to pathogen infection. Although, we agree that the observed mortality (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) could be, in fact, a consequence of deficiencies in the several other cell compartments and may include crosstalk independent <i>Nfkb2</i> functions. As discussed in the Results section (please see the subheading \u201cStromal expression of <i>Nfkb2</i> is required for limiting <i>C. rodentium</i> infection\u201d) and in the Discussion, we also do not rule out crosstalk-independent engagement of the <i>Nfkb2</i> pathway in other cell-types at a later stage of infection, those may contribute to the observed mortality in <i>Nfkb2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, epithelial RelA NF-\u03baB activation defects coupled to aggravated early colon pathology and early onset of mortality in <i>Nfkb2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice suggested that the stromal requirement of <i>Nfkb2</i>, at least in part, lies within the intestinal epithelial cells in the initial events controlling early innate immunity and involves crosstalk regulations.

Indeed, genetic studies have confirmed a requirement of RelA in the epithelial expressions of chemokine and cytokine genes and consequent neutrophil recruitment in LPS induced pneumonia (Alcamo et al., J. Immunol., 2001). In the revised manuscript, we have now cited this important contribution in the subsection \u201c<i>Nfkb2</i> integrates lymphotoxin signal within intestinal niche to reinforce epithelial NF-\u03baB responses to <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i>\u201d. Furthermore, TLR4 activated RelA was implicated in the chemokine gene expressions and neutrophil recruitment upon bacterial infections (Khan et al., Infect. Immunity., 2006, discussed in the second paragraph of the Discussion section). Consistent to these reports, our study revealed a correlation between diminished RelA activity in IECs and the inability of <i>Nfkb2</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice in limiting bacterial infection. Furthermore, our supershift analyses clearly demonstrated a complete absence of RelB DNA binding complexes in the enterocytes derived from infected WT mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

For a specific IKK2 activity explicitly defined through peak duration, amplitude and onset time, again all possible IKK1 activities must be considered for evaluating its crosstalk potency. We argue that hierarchical clustering of kinase profiles in a given axis would be even more arbitrary. Therefore, we contest that it is not possible to present crosstalk score in a matrix of IKK2 and IKK1 profiles in a two-dimensional plot as suggested. Unfortunately, even a three-dimensional plot would be insufficient. To remain connected to a broader audience (the manuscript describes bacterial colitis studies), we did not consider other multidimensional plotting modalities. Instead, we have attempted to reduce the complexity of the data by analyzing top 10% crosstalk proficient IKK2 or IKK1 profiles separately for peak duration or amplitude. In <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2B</a>, we have further utilized candidate kinase activity profiles in a case study to confirm fidelity of our interpretation. Moreover, use of experimentally derived long-duration or short-duration kinase activities consistently confirmed the presence of a duration code (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>).

Although suitable for presenting differential gene-expressions for a given stimulation regime, traditional heatmaps, with very small dynamic range, are inept in capturing synergistic gene-activations that require simultaneous and complex comparisons across multiple stimulation regimes. Therefore, we have adapted a previously published methodology (see ref. <a href=\"#bib44\">Zhu et. al., 2006</a>), which enables comparison of multiple stimulation regimes. Indeed, our crosstalk score based analyses identified 114 genes those are not only hyperinduced, but synergistically activated in the costimulation regime as compared to solitary LPS or \u03b1 LT\u03b2R treatments (see bottom panel, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).
