Here, we use a quantitative mass spectrometry/electron microscopy hybrid approach to determine the r-protein composition and conformation of 30S ribosome assembly intermediates in Escherichia coli. The relative timing of assembly of the 3\u2032 domain and the formation of the central pseudoknot (PK) structure depends on the presence of the assembly factor RimP. The central PK is unstable in the absence of RimP, resulting in the accumulation of intermediates in which the 3\u2032-domain is unanchored and the 5\u2032-domain is depleted for r-proteins S5 and S12 that contact the central PK. Our results reveal the importance of the cofactor RimP in central PK formation, and introduce a broadly applicable method for characterizing macromolecular assembly in cells."

Here, we use a quantitative mass spectrometry/electron microscopy hybrid approach to determine the r-protein composition and conformation of 30S ribosome assembly intermediates in Escherichia coli. The relative timing of assembly of the 3\u2032 domain and the formation of the central pseudoknot (PK) structure depends on the presence of the assembly factor RimP. The central PK is unstable in the absence of RimP, resulting in the accumulation of intermediates in which the 3\u2032-domain is unanchored and the 5\u2032-domain is depleted for r-proteins S5 and S12 that contact the central PK. Our results reveal the importance of the cofactor RimP in central PK formation, and introduce a broadly applicable method for characterizing macromolecular assembly in cells."

In <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>), the 70S ribosome is a large (2.4 MDa) ribonucleoprotein consisting of a small (30S) and large (50S) subunit. Because ribosome biogenesis is complex and taxing on the metabolic resources of the cell, the process is tightly regulated. The efficiency of ribosome assembly is so directly tied to cell growth that even slight defects in assembly confer a significant selective disadvantage, and strong defects can threaten cell survival. In addition, ribosomes must be assembled accurately to ensure the fidelity of protein synthesis. A large number of accessory factors have been implicated in the regulation and efficiency of ribosomal production, although the precise roles for many of these factors remain unknown (Reviewed in <a href=\"#bib74\">Wilson and Nierhaus, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shajani et al., 2011</a>)."

Early work by Nomura and colleagues established the order and dependencies of r-protein binding in the assembling 30S subunit under equilibrium conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mizushima and Nomura, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Held et al., 1973</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">1974</a>). In the early stages of assembly, primary r-proteins bind directly to the 5\u2032-, central and 3\u2032-domains of 16S rRNA. These initial r-protein binding events lead to changes in the rRNA structure, and facilitate subsequent binding of secondary and tertiary r-proteins (<a href=\"#bib26\">Held et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Stern et al., 1989</a>). More recent studies using time-resolved hydroxyl radical RNA structure probing (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adilakshmi et al., 2008</a>), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ridgeway et al., 2012</a>), single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2014</a>), pulse-chase monitored by quantitative mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#bib69\">Talkington et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bunner et al., 2010a</a>), and time-resolved negative stain electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mulder et al., 2010</a>) added valuable insight into the dynamics and kinetics of RNA folding, r-protein binding, and immature subunit conformations throughout the assembly process. These studies have revealed that even in the presence of r-protein binding dependencies, assembly can proceed through multiple parallel pathways. In addition, a large body of evidence indicates that misfolded rRNA structure leads to stable kinetic traps during in vitro 30S reconstitution, inhibiting the binding of several secondary and tertiary r-proteins and limiting the efficiency of the reconstitution (Reviewed in <a href=\"#bib67\">Sykes and Williamson, 2009</a>)."

Previous studies suggest that some assembly factors, such as RimM and RbfA, may promote efficient assembly by binding co-transcriptionally to the nascent rRNA to facilitate folding and to prevent the formation of kinetic traps (<a href=\"#bib73\">Williamson, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Clatterbuck Soper et al., 2013</a>). In addition, factors may guide rearrangement of rRNA structure at specific points during the assembly process, as is likely the case during the re-structuring and cleavage of the 16S 5\u2032-leader sequence late in assembly (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dammel and Noller, 1995</a>). Cryo-EM reconstructions indicate that several assembly factors, including RbfA (<a href=\"#bib17\">Datta et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jomaa et al., 2011b</a>), the GTPases Era (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sharma et al., 2005</a>) and RsgA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guo et al., 2011</a>), and the 16S rRNA methyltransferase KsgA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boehringer et al., 2012</a>), bind immature subunits and block them from prematurely entering the translation cycle. Many assembly factors appear to be functionally related, forming a complex network of interconnected activities (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bylund et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lu and Inouye, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Inoue et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Campbell and Brown, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Goto et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Connolly and Culver, 2013</a>).

Quantitative mass spectrometry (qMS) provides a high-throughput method for precisely measuring the relative levels of proteins in a complex mixture (<a href=\"#bib10\">Charollais et al., 2003</a>). Recently, qMS has been used to determine the composition of r-proteins within ribosomal assembly intermediates isolated from cells, revealing the binding dependencies of late-associating r-proteins on earlier binding r-proteins and assembly factors (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen and Williamson, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Clatterbuck Soper et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Guo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Leong et al., 2013</a>). Single-particle EM is also an ideal technique for analyzing heterogeneous samples due to the development of powerful alignment and classification schemes that enable the identification of sub-populations of particle conformations within a single sample (<a href=\"#bib18\">Frank, 2006</a>). Automated data collection and downstream image processing has greatly improved the throughput of single-particle EM analysis, facilitating the rapid analysis of even highly heterogeneous samples in a short period of time (<a href=\"#bib65\">Suloway et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lander et al., 2009</a>). In addition, automated random conical tilt (RCT) data collection enables three-dimensional reconstructions of each subpopulation identified in a sample (<a href=\"#bib52\">Radermacher et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Yoshioka et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Voss et al., 2010</a>).

Our approach exploits the exquisite facility of both techniques to analyze the heterogeneous samples generated by fractionating crude <i>E. coli</i> lysates using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. This one-step sample preparation eliminates the use of affinity tags or purification steps that may inadvertently lead to the exclusion of early intermediates. For each gradient fraction, ribosomal protein levels were measured using qMS, revealing r-proteins present or depleted within assembly intermediates. In parallel, gradient fractions were analyzed using single-particle negative stain EM to elucidate the structures of assembly intermediates and mature ribosomes present in each sample. These techniques were used to analyze <i>E. coli</i> 30S subunit assembly in wild type (WT) cells and in several assembly factor deletion strains. These studies revealed a novel intermediate, where the central pseudoknot (PK) that connects the 5\u2032-body domain of the 16S rRNA with the 3\u2032-head domain, is unformed, although the 3\u2032-head domain is partially assembled. Deletion of the assembly factor RimP causes a striking defect in central PK stability and results in the depletion of central PK-adjacent proteins S5 and S12, and late-binding proteins S2, S3 and S21. Together, our data suggest that central PK formation can occur either before or after head domain formation. Furthermore, our data implicate RimP in efficient central PK formation and in the subsequent incorporation of tertiary r-proteins S2, S3, S5, S12 and S21. In addition to providing novel insights into ribosome assembly, our approach represents a generalizable toolkit for studying the assembly of supramolecular structures in heterogeneous cellular samples."

The presence of four distinct groups of r-protein levels suggests that several intermediate species with varied r-protein compositions are present in early 30S fractions.

The cell lysate was resolved by sucrose gradient centrifugation and five fractions encompassing the entire 30S peak were collected for qMS and EM analysis, allowing for a direct comparison of r-protein compositions with the observed particle conformations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). For qMS analysis, an equimolar amount of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled ribosomes was added to each fraction prior to trypsin digestion. The resulting combination of <sup>14</sup>N- and <sup>15</sup>N-labeled peptides was quantified by LC-MS with the <sup>15</sup>N-labeled peptides used as a reference. Peptides were detected for all r-proteins with the exception of later binding proteins with very low abundance in fraction 1 (S2, S3, S13, S19, S21) and S17 for fractions 1, 4 and 5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The isotope distribution fits for S17 peptides are often poor for both the experimental and reference sample, preventing unambiguous assignment of these peptides and necessitating their exclusion from the qMS analysis for some fractions. For convenience, the abundance of each r-protein in the experimental sample was normalized to that of the early binder S4, which is expected to be present in all assembling 30S particles. R-proteins were then grouped by the profile of their relative abundances using hierarchal clustering.

The predominant conformation (Group I) present in early 30S peak fraction 2 is the earliest identifiable intermediate, encompassing the 5\u2032-body and platform regions, but wholly lacking density for the 3\u2032-head domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The abundance of Group I particles is consistent with the depletion of 3\u2032-domain proteins (S2, S3, S7, S9, S10, S13, S14, S19) observed by qMS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

In Group II, the head appears to be completely unanchored from the platform domain, swinging well away from the helix 23/S11 interaction region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast, in Group III the head appears to be docked along the platform domain as it is in mature subunits, but angled away from its final resting spot along the body domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The vastly different locations of the head domain in Group II and Group III can be readily observed in RCT reconstructions of classes from these Groups (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). RCT volumes for classes from both Groups suggest that late-binding proteins S2 and S3 may be missing from these particles, consistent with the relatively low levels of the proteins observed by qMS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). In the three RCT reconstructions obtained for classes from WT Group II, the location of the head varies in relation to the 5\u2032-domain.

Groups IV and V are highly represented in later fractions from the 30S peak, consistent with qMS data showing nearly stoichiometric levels of most r-proteins in these fractions. RCT reconstructions of Group IV classes appear to lack some density in the platform region, suggesting that these particles may primarily be late intermediates depleted of very late-binders such as S21 and S2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Similarly, for Group V, one subgroup of classes that appears to be missing density in the same region of the platform was detected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). A second subgroup of classes clearly missing density for S3 but containing density for S2 and S21 was observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), in agreement with previous in vitro observations showing that S2 can bind prior to S3 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mulder et al., 2010</a>). Other Group V particles appear to be fully mature (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), suggesting that 70S ribosomes may have disassociated during sample preparation. Together, these late-intermediate classes account for the depletion of S2, S3 and S21 observed in the qMS analysis of the late fractions of the 30S peak."

The vastly different location of the head in these particles compared to Group III particles suggests two alternate pathways for formation of the 3\u2032-domain, either before or after docking of the head onto the platform region of the central domain. In 16S rRNA, the central domain (16S nt:567-912) and 3\u2032-major domain comprising the head (16S nt:920-1396) are connected by a short linker (16S nt:913-919), which forms a long range pseudoknot interaction with helix 1 (h1) at the 5\u2032-end (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). This central pseudoknot (PK) is formed by helix 2 (h2), and is the primary structural feature that leads to the positioning of the head domain upon the platform domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). The detachment of the head from the platform in Group II classes suggests that these particles may have unstable or unformed central PK regions. To probe the stability of the RNA in the central PK region, an RNase H cleavage assay was developed using a DNA oligonucleotide anti-sense to the 3\u2032-end of helix 27 (h27) and the 3\u2032-strand of h2 (16S nt:906-920, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This \u2018anti-PK\u2019 oligo was incubated with samples encompassing the 30S sucrose gradient peak, allowing the oligo to specifically anneal to assembly intermediates in which the central PK is unformed. The hybridized RNA was subsequently digested with RNase H, resulting in two 16S products encompassing the 5\u2032- (\u223c900 nt) and 3\u2032-domains (\u223c600 nt) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The qMS analysis of the fractions containing 30S particles and 70S ribosomes from the WT and <i>\u0394rimP</i> strains reveals that the 30S particles in the early fractions of both strains have higher <i>f</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> values than the 70S ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

In both 2D class averages and 3D RCT volumes, the location of the head volume is highly variable (residues 912\u2013920) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). To facilitate the 3D structural analysis, the RCT volumes in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> were aligned based on the body/platform density, and the average density and variance maps between the 10 volumes were calculated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). The regions of high variance are mainly localized to the head domain, which can sample a substantial range of motion, from locations close to the S11-binding region in the platform domain to the S4-binding region of the body domain. Analysis of Group II particles in 2D by Maskiton (<a href=\"#bib75\">Yoshioka et al., 2013</a>) recapitulates this result and additionally indicates that head movement is constrained by a short but highly flexible linker (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), likely comprising the 3\u2032-end of helix 27 and the 3\u2032-strand of the unformed h2 (16S residues 910\u2013919). Indeed, the distance between the head and body among Group II RCT volumes is generally 20\u201340 \u00c5, well within the range of lengths that could be accommodated by a 10-nt ssRNA. PDB models of the 16S rRNA for the body/platform region (nt 1-909) and the head domain (nt 920-1396) were docked into the average density from the 10 RCT volumes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,G</a>), and the distance between the two domains could be accounted by the length of the 910\u2013919 linker. A 50-\u00c5 filter was additionally applied to the PDB model containing the 16S rRNA and r-proteins (excluding S2), revealing striking similarities to several RCT volumes in the amount of density observed for both the body/platform and head domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). The similarity in size suggests that Group II particles may contain a nearly complete complement of r-proteins in the head domain, and that head domain assembly can occur prior to central PK formation."

However, the sample complexity prohibited a detailed characterization of assembly intermediates in which the central PK is unformed. To reduce this sample complexity, an affinity purification protocol was developed using a biotinylated oligonucleotide anti-sense to the 3\u2032-strand of h2, similar to the anti-PK oligo used in the RNase H assays described above. This \u2018capture oligo\u2019 was incubated with samples containing 30S subunits and/or intermediates, then bound by NeutrAvidin agarose resin. After thorough washing of the resin, 30S particles annealed to the capture oligo were displaced by adding an excess of a DNA oligo bearing complete complementarity to the capture oligo. Using this purification strategy, 30S intermediates were enriched both from 30S peak sucrose gradient fractions and directly from \u0394<i>rimP</i> crude lysate (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, no 16S rRNA could be detected when purified mature 30S subunits were incubated with the capture oligo (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Whereas samples taken directly from sucrose gradient fractions yielded images containing a large number of non-ribosomal <i>E. coli</i> complexes, raw images obtained from the affinity purified sample contained no readily observable non-ribosomal particles, confirming the specific purification of 30S particles. Particle classification further indicated the specific enrichment of early assembly intermediates, with the majority of particles classifying into Group I and II class averages and very few Group III-V classes observed. In addition to the previously identified Groups, an additional class was observed that might be partial degradation products of Group II intermediates corresponding to the 3\u2032-domain of the 30S subunit. Forward projections of the 30S 3\u2032-domain filtered to 30 \u00c5 strongly resemble the observed class averages (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). In addition, the putative 3\u2032-domain particles varied in abundance based on the amount of 16S rRNA degradation observed in the pulldown sample (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Together, these observations suggest that particles in these classes contain the final \u223c600 nt of the 16S rRNA, including the head domain and the 3\u2032-minor domain containing helices 44 (h44) and 45. Indeed, density for h44 could be observed in some negative stain class averages, and was readily observed by cryo-EM (see below, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The 3\u2032-domain particles appear to be preferentially enriched, suggesting that the 16S:906-920 region is more exposed in these particles than in Group II particles. The 3\u2032-domain particles likely result from non-specific cleavage of the exposed central PK region in Group II particles by contaminating RNases in the sample used for affinity purification. Efforts were made to limit sample degradation using RNase inhibitors, with limited success, further indicating the extent of rRNA exposure in the \u0394<i>rimP</i> intermediates."

The relative abundance of each r-protein, normalized with respect to S4, shows that S2 and S12 are very depleted in 30S particles with PK instability, with partial depletion of S3 and S5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The depletion of S2, S3 and S12 in particles with PK instability is consistent with the earlier analysis of all the particles found in the 30S peak. The observed low abundance of S5 in the affinity purified particles could have been masked by the presence of a significant amount of particles containing S5 in the untreated sample. Furthermore, the affinity purified particles show a high abundance of most of the 3\u2032-domain r-proteins relative to early 5\u2032-domain binder, S4. This is consistent with the observation that 3\u2032-domain particles are preferentially enriched by the purification procedure. With the exception of S2 and S3, the uniform abundance of all the 3\u2032-domain r-proteins in the purified intermediates suggests that head domain formation is not perturbed until the very late stages of assembly. Some r-proteins, S17 and S21 could not be accurately quantitated in the qMS analysis due to poor fits of their isotope distributions, while the significantly high abundance of S18 is possibly due to its exchange in the 70S particles used as a reference."

Similar to the negative stain analysis, class averages from the cryo-EM data set revealed that the majority of particles are early intermediates (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Despite efforts to limit sample degradation, a substantial number of 3\u2032-domain degradation products were observed in the class averages, leading to an increase in the compositional heterogeneity of the data set. In addition, flexibility between the head and body domains in Group II intermediates led to significant conformational heterogeneity for these particles, and limited the ability to reconstruct 3D volumes for these particles. Efforts were therefore concentrated on 3D classification of the Group I cryo-EM particles. Following extensive sorting and classification of Group I particles, four reconstructions of this early intermediate were generated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>). As expected, the Group I structures lack density for the entire 3\u2032-domain, including all RNA and r-proteins comprising the head domain and helices 44 and 45 of the 3\u2032-minor domain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). In addition, 16S rRNA helix 27 lies completely outside the density in all Group I reconstructions, indicating that this final secondary structural element of the central domain is not present in these particles. Notably, the Group I reconstructions also clearly lack density for both S5 and S12, consistent with their observed depletion by qMS. The relatively high levels of S5 in comparison to S12 suggest that S5 may be present in Group II particles, while S12 is likely missing from both intermediates."

In agreement with variations observed by 3D classification of the particles, this codimensional PCA revealed that variability between these structures mainly arises from differences in the platform region (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Given the limited resolution of these reconstructions, it is difficult to discern whether these differences are due to compositional or conformational variability in Group I particles. However, the levels of S11 measured by qMS are slightly depleted in comparison to other central domain proteins, in agreement with the variability in S11 density observed in the Group I reconstructions. Together, these analyses of Group I cryo-EM particles suggest that structural stability within the platform region may be dependent on assembly and docking of the 3\u2032-domain."

These previous studies provided insight into the order, hierarchies and kinetics of r-protein binding and rRNA folding, the fundamental underpinnings of ribosome biogenesis. In contrast, the understanding of in vivo ribosome assembly is relatively modest, owing in part to a lack of tools for the efficient study of this process at a molecular level. Recent developments in biophysical techniques have facilitated more detailed studies into the molecular mechanisms of cellular ribosome biogenesis, and especially the roles of various biogenesis factors. We have developed a high-throughput hybrid qMS/EM approach to study the composition and structure of cellular ribosome assembly intermediates. Our approach allows for the direct comparison of data sets from multiple samples, enabling quantitation of assembly intermediate distribution upon perturbation of the biogenesis pathway."

Theoretically, all soluble proteins and complexes present in the cell could be observed across the gradient, including all stable ribosomal assembly intermediates. However, other dense cellular complexes that co-elute with 30S assembly intermediates and mature subunits increase sample heterogeneity. Indeed, several abundant proteins and complexes were readily observed in gradient fractions by proteomic analysis and by negative stain EM (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At the center of the 30S peak, the majority of the particles (65\u201370%) were ribosomal; however, fractions on the leading and lagging edges of the 30S peak were far more heterogeneous, containing only 30\u201335% ribosomal particles. The amount of data required to overcome this sample heterogeneity made high-throughput data collection indispensable for the detection of a wide range of 30S assembly intermediates. The combination of EM and qMS allowed for the classification of these intermediates along the 30S assembly pathway. Moreover, the application of stable isotope pulse-labeling and qMS facilitated the determination of assembly intermediates as on-pathway."

The difference in the location of head density between Group II and Group III particles suggests that these conformations may result from two such parallel assembly pathways. In particular, the central PK, the long-range tertiary interaction within 16S rRNA that anchors the head domain to the body and platform, appears to be formed in Group III but unformed in Group II particles. Central PK formation occurs late in the assembly pathway (<a href=\"#bib50\">Powers et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Besancon and Wagner, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Holmes and Culver, 2004</a>), and could potentially occur after the modular assembly of the 5\u2032-body, central, and 3\u2032-head domains (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sykes and Williamson, 2009</a>). This appears to be the case in Group II particles, in which nearly complete density is observed for all three domains in RCT reconstructions (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5D and 5G</a>). In contrast, Group III particles have partially formed heads that are anchored to the body and platform domains, suggesting that assembly of the head domain proceeds following central PK formation in these intermediates.

Surprisingly, we found that deletion of RimP has a much stronger effect on central PK exposure than either RimM or RbfA, suggesting that RimP may have a more direct role in central PK formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>).

Deletion of RbfA leads to defects in folding of the 3\u2032-head domain and the 5\u2032-body domain, including the final placement of h44 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clatterbuck Soper et al., 2013</a>).

The \u0394<i>rimP</i> strain was significantly depleted in S2, S3, S12 and S21 when compared to the WT strain. EM analysis of the \u0394<i>rimP</i> sucrose gradient fractions revealed that these abundant intermediates are mainly Group I and II particles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). In particular, Group II is enriched by &gt;3-fold in \u0394<i>rimP</i> samples when directly compared to WT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This result suggests that Group II intermediates may either be more long-lived in \u0394<i>rimP</i> cells than in WT, or that RimP normally prevents Group II intermediates from forming in WT cells. The \u0394<i>rimP</i> intermediates are on-pathway and are eventually incorporated into 70S ribosomes, based on pulse-labeling analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). However, incorporation of depleted proteins occurs at a relatively slow rate, suggesting that the completion of these intermediates is kinetically unfavorable. RimP may act as a chaperone to prevent the assembling 30S subunit from falling into this kinetic trap. RimP has previously been shown to bind to free 30S subunits resolved on sucrose gradients, but not complete 70S ribosomes, indicating that it directly interacts with 30S assembly intermediates (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nord et al., 2009</a>)."

Together with our findings, these previous results suggest that addition of RimP to 30S reconstitution experiments may help to promote central PK formation and avoid the kinetically unfavorable Group I and Group II intermediates. In previous EM studies of assembly intermediates present during in vitro 30S reconstitution, Group I-like class averages were highly abundant at early time-points during assembly (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mulder et al., 2010</a>). Intriguingly, Group II-like classes are also present during the early stages of assembly, although they were uncharacterized in that study (See Figure 1B in <a href=\"#bib45\">Mulder et al., 2010</a>). The presence of Group I and II-like classes subsides with the incorporation of S5 and S12, as measured by pulse-chase followed by qMS. These previous in vitro results agree with the present in vivo observations that kinetically unfavorable pre-central PK conformations remain viable on-pathway intermediates."

The accurate formation and stability of the central PK is a critical step during small subunit assembly in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Recently, the essential ribosomal biogenesis factor Mrd1 was implicated in central PK formation in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib58\">Segerstolpe et al., 2013</a>). Mrd1 contains multiple RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and binds directly to 18S rRNA helices h27 and h28, two secondary structural elements that reside in close proximity to the central PK in the mature small subunit structure (<a href=\"#bib58\">Segerstolpe et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, RimP is composed of two RBDs, and may play an analogous role in binding to 16S rRNA regions adjacent to the central PK. We propose that RimP acts during the early and late stages of 30S subunit biogenesis to assist in the stabilization of the central pseudoknot, allowing for the subsequent incorporation of central-PK binding r-proteins S5 and S12 and late binding r-proteins S2, S3 and S21 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). During the early stages of 30S biogenesis, premature central PK formation is blocked by a structure within the 16S 5\u2032-leader that is mutually exclusive with h1. RbfA is thought to bind to the leader sequence and promote formation of h1 during the late stages of assembly, and may act synergistically with RimP to stabilize the central PK. In contrast, RimM may act independently of RimP to facilitate assembly of the head domain regardless of the status of central PK formation. Overall, our findings suggest that RimP might be one of the earliest factors to act upon the assembling 30S subunit. The combined EM/qMS approach employed here should have immediate and broad applicability to study of the role of other ribosome assembly factors as well as macromolecular assembly processes involving other bacterial and eukaryotic cellular machines."

These angles were further refined and particles were classified through 200 rounds into four models using Frealign 9 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lyumkis et al., 2013a</a>). The final distribution of particles and Fourier shell correlations for the 4 models were as follows: Model 1 \u2013 3407 particles, 27.6 \u00c5; Model 2 \u2013 2975 particles, 26.1 \u00c5; Model 3 \u2013 2722 particles, 27.0 \u00c5; Model 4 \u2013 3241 particles, 25.4 \u00c5. Variance analysis for the Group I cryo-EM particles was performed using the codimensional PCA application in SPARX (<a href=\"#bib47\">Penczek et al., 2011</a>). All structure figures were created in UCSF Chimera (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>)."

RNase H assays were performed in Buffer A, with 10 mM DTT substituted for the 6 mM \u03b2-Me. Cleavage reactions were initiated on ice by adding 0.5 pmol 30S subunits (final concentration 33 nM) to 50 or 500 pmol (final concentration 3.3 or 33 \u00b5M) anti-PK or anti-h21 oligo (or buffer A for mock reactions) and 5U RNase H (New England Biolabs) (or buffer A for mock reactions). Samples were incubated on ice at 4\u00b0C for 16 hr, then resolved on a 2% agarose/TAE gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Intact 16S rRNA and cleavage products were quantified using ImageQuant software, with the two cleavage bands treated as a single product. The intensity of \u2018cleavage products\u2019 detected in the mock reaction lane was subtracted from the cleavage band for each reaction containing oligo, to account for background cleavage that may have occured before or during the RNase H reaction. Fraction cleaved was calculated by dividing the volume of the cleavage products by the total RNA in the lane (cleavage products plus uncleaved rRNA). The average of three replicates was plotted with error bars representing the standard deviation between the three replicates."

Oligonucleotides were designed based on the anti-PK oligo used for the RNase H assay. The capture oligo comprised a 5\u2032-biotin followed by 10 random DNA nucleotides and finally the 2\u2032-O-methylated anti-PK sequence (5\u2032-biotin-CTACAGGTGCAAmAmUmUmCmAmUmUmUmGmAmGmUmUmU-3\u2032), in order to promoted annealing of the anti-PK sequence to the 16S rRNA. The displacement DNA oligonucleotide was completely complementary to the capture oligo (5\u2032-AAACTCAAATGAATTTGCACCTGTAG-3\u2032). Samples used for affinity purification contained 200 pmol of F2-3 from the <i>\u0394rimP</i> sucrose gradient (30S peak), 20 OD260 of \u0394<i>rimP</i> lysate, or 200 pmol purified 30S subunits in 350 \u00b5l Buffer A. Each sample was incubated with 17.5 \u00b5l 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 2 \u00b5l 100 \u00b5M capture anti-PK oligo (200 pmol), and 5 \u00b5l RNasin at 30\u00b0C for 15 min. NuetrAvadin agarose beads (100 \u00b5l per sample) (Thermo Scientific) were blocked with 0.5 mg/ml BSA in Buffer A twice, then washed with Buffer A, and finally incubated at 30\u00b0C for 10 min. Samples were added to beads, then incubated at 30\u00b0C for 10 min. Samples were then transferred to 4\u00b0C, and incubated with rocking for 2 hr. Beads were centrifuged for 5 min at 500\u00d7<i>g</i>, and the supernatant was removed. Beads were washed four times at 4\u00b0C with Buffer A + 0.01% Nikkol, then twice more at room temperature with 5 min of incubation with rocking for each wash. Samples were eluted by adding 5 pmol of displacement oligo to 150 \u00b5l of Buffer A + 0.01% Nikkol. The buffer and beads were incubated with gentle rocking at room temperature for 30 min, then centrifuged for 5 min at 500\u00d7g, and the eluent was removed. This elution was repeated up to three times, but very little 16S rRNA was observed in later elution fractions. Samples were visualized on a 2% agarose/TAE gel stained with ethidium bromide. The first elution fraction was aliquoted and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to EM analysis. Samples for qMS were generated in the same manner, except 275 pmol 30S ribosomes, 500 pmol capture oligo and 250 \u00b5l NeutrAvidin Agarose beads were used for affinity purification, and 2.5 \u00b5M of displacement oligo was used for elution."

The authors use a combined mass spec/EM approach in an impressive technical tour de force. They first analyze 30S subunit assembly intermediates obtained from sucrose gradient fractions from wild-type cells, correlating the absence of specific ribosomal proteins with characteristic features of EM images of immature particles. They then use their approach to compare wild-type assembly with that of cells carrying mutations that affect 30S assembly. A major finding is that the ribosome assembly factor rimP appears to be critical for formation of the central pseudoknot of 16S rRNA and assembly of its associated ribosomal proteins. This is an outstanding paper that advances our understanding of <i>in vivo</i> ribosome assembly and demonstrates the use of a powerful new approach to studying the assembly of complex cellular particles."

This study goes a long way towards proving that RimP, a gene product long known to be involved in ribosome assembly, plays an important role in ensuring that the central pseudoknot in 16S rRNA forms properly during assembly."

In these datasets, we could not unambiguously assign the poorly fit S17 peptides, and so they were excluded from our analysis. We have added the following sentences to the text to clarify this lack of data: \u201cPeptides were detected for all r-proteins with the exception of later binding proteins with very low abundance in fraction 1 (S2, S3, S13, S19, S21) and S17 for fractions 1, 4 and 5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The isotope distribution fits for S17 peptides are often poor for both the experimental and reference sample, preventing unambiguous assignment of these peptides and necessitating their exclusion from the qMS analysis.\u201d"
