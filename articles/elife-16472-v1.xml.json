In vertebrates, the optic tectum (superior colliculus) commands gaze shifts by synaptic integration of different sensory modalities. Recent works suggest that tectum can elaborate gaze reorientation commands on its own, rather than merely acting as a relay from upstream/forebrain circuits to downstream premotor centers. We show that tectal circuits can perform multisensory computations independently and, hence, configure final motor commands. Single tectal neurons receive converging visual and electrosensory inputs, as investigated in the lamprey - a phylogenetically conserved vertebrate. When these two sensory inputs overlap in space and time, response enhancement of output neurons occurs locally in the tectum, whereas surrounding areas and temporally misaligned inputs are inhibited. Retinal and electrosensory afferents elicit local monosynaptic excitation, quickly followed by inhibition via recruitment of GABAergic interneurons. Multisensory inputs can thus regulate event-detection within tectum through local inhibition without forebrain control."

These modalities are represented within the optic tectum and are used for orienting and avoidance behaviors (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hartline et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Semm and Demaine, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Valentine and Moss, 1997</a>) in vertebrates extending from lampreys to primates (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wurtz and Albano, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Nieuwenhuys and Nicholson, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Saitoh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jones et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Asteriti et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kardamakis et al., 2015</a>). We have previously shown in the lamprey that site-specific stimulation across the deep layer of the optic tectum gives rise to eye-head gaze shifts of given amplitude and direction, thus, showing the existence of a motor map (<a href=\"#bib38\">Saitoh et al., 2007</a>). We now show that visual and electroreceptive inputs are integrated in the same deep layer neurons of the optic tectum, which provide the output to different brainstem centers. Projecting output neurons, as well as local interneurons, receive monosynaptic excitatory input from both sensory afferent pathways and also disynaptic inhibition triggered by the same afferents. This applies if the two signals are activated from the same point in space, whereas signals from surrounding areas provide only inhibition (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kardamakis et al., 2015</a>). The membrane properties of the tectal output neurons ensure the temporal integration of bimodally triggered excitatory and inhibitory currents. Due to the highly conserved organization of the optic tectum (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nieuwenhuys and Nicholson, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Saitoh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jones et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Asteriti et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kardamakis et al., 2015</a>), we anticipate that the mechanisms of integration of two senses on single output neurons, as demonstrated here, may also apply to other vertebrates."

We now show that this unisensory response suppression can also be achieved by using multiple stimuli of different sensory modalities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Once a tectal region responsive to a local electroreceptive stimulus was established (red trace, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), we were able to suppress the magnitude of the on-response (red trace) by delivering a stimulus to an off-response region of the retina (black trace). To confirm that the lack of activity in response to the visual stimulation (blue trace) was not due to unsuccessful stimulation, we performed control recordings in other tectal regions, as well as in downstream brainstem regions. An average response reduction of ~75% was observed during spatially misaligned cross-modal sensory stimulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; red for electrosensory and black for bimodal stimulation; <i>n\u00a0=\u00a05</i>).

We then quantified the likelihood of their all-or-none responses to each impulse (<i>n\u00a0=\u00a06</i>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, right). Bimodal activation resulted in a higher spiking probability of single stimulus-locked action potentials (statistical differences of p&lt;0.001).

Furthermore, output neurons also discharge action potentials with a regular firing pattern in response to stepwise increases of applied current, and display a continuous and linear frequency-current relationship in the lower range of current injections (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A-iii</a>; slope: 0.53 \u00b1 0.05 spikes/pA, <i>n\u00a0=\u00a032</i>).

When co-stimulating both afferent pathways, excitatory postsynaptic current and inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitudes increased in direct correspondence to the unimodal-evoked responses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). On a trial-to-trial basis, the statistical difference in the magnitude of evoked EPSC and IPSC currents by bimodal and visual or electroreceptive afferent stimulation was significant (visual-bimodal: p=0.008; electrosensory-bimodal: p=0.006; one-way ANOVA), but not between those evoked during visual and electrosensory (p=0.99). The same was true for the evoked IPSCs (visual-bimodal: p=0.006; electrosensory-bimodal: p=0.0009; both visual and electrosensory against bimodal: p=0.24). Notably, no statistical significance (p=0.85 for EPSCs and p=0.92 for IPSCs) was detected when comparing the mean differences between the sum of unisensory-evoked and bimodal-evoked currents (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; EPSCs, visual: 28.63 \u00b1 5.6\u2009pA, electrosensory: 28.4 \u00b1 5.85\u2009pA, both: 56.27 \u00b1 9.11, <i>n\u00a0= 12</i>; IPSCs, visual: 24.04 \u00b1 6.15\u2009pA, electrosensory: 33.7 \u00b1 14.82\u2009pA, both: 55.22 \u00b1 15.79\u2009pA, <i>n\u00a0= 7</i>). As predicted by their membrane properties, output neurons are able to temporally integrate the synaptic currents evoked by individual unisensory inputs summate to generate an enhanced bimodal product."

The plot in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> shows how the overall synaptic conductance (<i>G<sub>syn</sub></i>; after subtraction of rest conductance) varies during the first 100 ms of the synaptic response, as plotted against the estimated reversal potential (<i>V<sub>rev</sub></i>). The overall shape of this relationship for visual (blue dots), electrosensory (red dots) and bimodal (black dots) is very similar on a cell-to-cell basis. The few points with a reversal potential near zero represent the initial portion of the response when excitation dominates. However, the peak conductance is at a reversal potential near \u221248 to \u221250 mV.

This time lag is sufficient for transient stimuli to efficiently summate inputs towards spike threshold before the onset of the inhibition. The quenching effect of this feedforward inhibition can account for the mismatch between the evoked EPSP amplitudes to their underlying excitatory conductances during bimodal stimulation, i.e. the subadditive effect of combining both sensory inputs. Furthermore, the summating effect observed in the synaptic current measurements obtained in voltage clamp (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) is also reflected in <i>G<sub>e</sub></i> and <i>G<sub>i</sub> </i>(<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This close agreement suggests that non-linearities in the form of strong voltage-dependent conductances or shunting inhibition are not likely to play a significant role in the gain regulation of responses in output neurons during multisensory integration."

This inhibition is carried by short- and long-range connections spanning rostrocaudally and mediolaterally across the optic tectum (<a href=\"#bib33\">Phongphanphanee et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kardamakis et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). While this local inhibition can act independently for generating stimulus selection, it has also been suggested that exogenous sources are required for generating global inhibition via GABAergic neurons in the isthmic nucleus (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mysore and Knudsen, 2013</a>). Here, we show that inhibition hard-wired in the optic tectum via interneurons, that are activated from both retinal and electroreceptive afferents in the same way as the output neurons, is essential for multisensory stimulus selection. Notably, the two types of sensory inputs not only evoke excitation in tectal interneurons, but also trigger recurrent inhibition."

However, the detailed arrangement of columnar structure and function has yet to be revealed. Sensory inputs provide monosynaptic drive to the deep layer output cells and to superficial layer interneurons. The latter, in turn, provide local and long-range inhibitory projections, therefore allowing for spatial sensory discrimination. This role of inhibition is observed in our extracellular recordings. Consistent with bimodal suppression in mammals (<a href=\"#bib25\">Meredith and Stein, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kadunce et al., 1997</a>), responses in on-field regions of tectum to electrosensory stimulation undergo a drastic reduction when delivering visual stimuli to other receptive fields of the tectal map. In the present study, we could not elicit the same sort of reduction in tectal areas responsive for visual stimulation when applying off-field electrosensory stimuli. One possibility is that electrosensory maps in the lamprey tectum are not as refined as the visual ones, and therefore inhibition is less effective suppressing off-regions. In this sense, it has been shown that electrosensory receptive fields in elasmobranchs tectum are much larger than the visual ones (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bodznick, 1990</a>). We cannot exclude either that the way we perform electrosensory stimulation is not as local as the visual one, making it less effective to evoke a similar reduction. Consistent with our previous findings, these data suggest that inhibitory connections embedded within the tectal circuit can account for how normally effective stimuli can be attenuated by the presence of bimodal stimuli when they are spatial and/or temporally misaligned."

The\u00a0output neurons yield responses of matching amplitudes to both types of sensory inputs, without any apparent domination by a particular modality. Two overlapping (in space and time) stimuli from these two modalities will produce a stronger response, than when only one modality is present. As a rule, two sensory modalities that provide stimuli spatially and temporally aligned are most likely related to the same external event. In this manner, the response enhancement caused by the integration of two senses gives rise to higher event detection reliability. When this occurs, bimodal inputs are able to increase the amount of depolarization in output neurons and increase the probability of evoking an action potential, and therefore, to activate their downstream targets and elicit a motor response."

Without this inhibition, response enhancement will not be possible since tectal output cells rapidly saturate most likely due to a ceiling effect, making neurons incapable of further responding and thereby losing their response sensitivity, and hence, event detection reliability. Tectal inhibitory action can be interpreted as a gain modulatory mechanism whose effects are well captured by the conductance-based analysis of output neurons, and visible throughout a wide range of membrane potentials (i.e., varying from below to above spike threshold). Local circuit dynamics triggered by sensory inputs will allow for depolarizing synaptic events to reach the reversal potential of the synaptic response. We show that this value is invariant during unimodal or bimodal stimulation implying that a strong unimodal stimulus can bring the membrane potential to action potential threshold, as well as two weaker bimodal stimuli. When bimodal stimuli overlap, they will reinforce each other and generate larger depolarizing currents that will increase the likelihood that the output neurons reach spike threshold before inhibition fully develops. This enhancement most likely arises from sensory inputs that target the different dendritic compartments of output neurons (i.e., superficial vs intermediate layer), that were previously inactive during unimodal stimulation."

Pallium (evolutionary forerunner of the mammalian cortex) projects to the lamprey optic tectum and provides monosynaptic excitation to the output neurons in the deep layer, and its\u00a0stimulation is able to elicit eye-head gaze movements (<a href=\"#bib31\">Oca\u00f1a et al., 2015</a>). In the forebrain control of tectum, it would seem likely that the basal ganglia disinhibition will be complementary to the excitation conveyed from pallium/cortex, and in both cases they target the soma level of the output neurons rather than the dendrites."

This amplification is thought not to arise from the intrinsic collicular circuitry, but from extrinsic cortico-collicular afferents from the anterior ectosylvian sulcus. When this area is inactivated the amplification vanishes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wallace and Stein, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jiang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarado et al., 2009</a>). One mechanism would be to bypass tectal inhibition by selectively increasing excitation onto the output neurons, which are targeted by monosynaptic projections from cortex/pallium in both mammals and lamprey. Another potential mechanism that would introduce such non-linearities could be a selective decrease of inhibition by briefly \u2018switching off\u2019 the tectal GABAergic system. The variable classes of tectal interneurons may also provide an additional flexibility to manipulate sensorimotor processing within the optic tectum."

The lamprey optic tectum consists of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons activated by unimodal and bimodal inputs. The output neurons found in the deep layer are excitatory and project to the brainstem, and control gaze movements (<a href=\"#bib38\">Saitoh et al., 2007</a>). In lamprey, visual and electrosensory stimuli evoke direct excitation quickly followed by recruited inhibition onto these output neurons. These synaptic responses are amplified when spatiotemporally aligned bimodal inputs are present, thus, leading to a response enhancement. We have shown here that sensory-evoked inhibition scales the neural activity of output cells to allow for a robust spatiotemporal integration, capable of integrating the enormous amount of incoming sensory inputs during natural conditions. Local inhibition may be critical for spatiotemporal processing not only in lamprey but also in other vertebrates."

In all recordings, these estimates were accurate because (i) the synaptic responses were composed primarily of ionotropic glutamatergic synapses (primarily AMPA, see also <a href=\"#bib20\">Kardamakis et al., 2015</a>) and chloride-mediated GABAergic (GABA<sub>A</sub>) synaptic inputs, (ii) their reversal potentials were experimentally determined and found to be at 0 and \u221275 mV, respectively, and (iii) due to the linearity domain of their voltage-current relationships and similar time constants."

This work uses several innovative preparations to record from output cells and interneurons both extracellularly and in whole cell mode while delivering biologically meaningful stimuli. They demonstrate that visual and electrosensory stimuli evoke direct excitation onto output neurons, which is quickly followed by recruited inhibition. These synaptic responses are enhanced when spatiotemporally aligned bimodal inputs are given, whereas temporally misaligned inputs are inhibited. They also show that multisensory inputs can regulate event-detection within tectum through this local inhibition. As in other vertebrates, there is evidence that in lampreys optic tectum output neurons commands gaze shifts by synaptic integration of different sensory modalities. Thus these findings have significant implications for how multimodal sensory inputs are integrated with behavioral responses in vertebrates."

Can these differences be readily reconciled? Furthermore, direct electrical stimulation of the retinal afferents to the OT bypasses all of the retinal processing that takes place, and that slows the conduction of information to the SC (relative to electroreception). Wouldn't one expect that peak gain would be seen when the visual inputs lag the electroreceptive inputs rather than at absolute simultaneity? c) In the experiments like those in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> it would seem appropriate to test temporally and also spatially misaligned stimuli. The authors never really study spatial misalignment, yet imply their results are relevant to such misalignment. Have such experiments been done and can they be incorporated?"

Consistent with bimodal suppression in mammals (Meredith and Stein, 1996; Kadunce et al., 1997), responses in on-field regions of tectum to electrosensory stimulation undergo a drastic reduction when delivering visual stimuli to other receptive fields of the tectal map. In the present study, we could not elicit the same sort of reduction in tectal areas responsive for visual stimulation when applying offfield electrosensory stimuli. One possibility is that electrosensory maps in the lamprey tectum are not as refined as the visual ones, and therefore inhibition is less effective suppressing offregions."

This is clearly useful technically to elucidate the microcircuit but on the other hand it is not directly behaviorally relevant. To understand whether the modest temporal changes observed here are relevant in a behavioral context, we would need to record from a number of single isolated units simultaneously, while applying visual and electrosensory stimuli.

One difference that emerges when comparing circuit dynamics between mouse SC and lamprey OT is that interlaminar inhibition mediating the superficial and deep layers is not monosynaptic, but rather polysynaptic. For instance, lamprey tectal output neurons are able to the discharge of one time-locked action potential in response to either sensory modality and this is a consequence of the fast suppression induced by the monosynaptic recruitment of local inhibition, thus, allowing for a narrow window of opportunity for membrane depolarization (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, see also Kardamakis et al., 2015). In the mouse SC, microstimulation of the superficial layer or optic tract can evoke a burst of action potentials (see Saito Y. and Isa T., 2003). We attribute this discrepancy between the time-locked action potential found in lamprey OT and the burst of action potentials in mouse SC, in that local inhibition allows for a larger window of opportunity for multisensory inputs to summate for a longer duration, thus, enabling output neurons to discharge more action potentials since no monosynaptic IPSPs have been reportedly evoked from the superficial layer (see Saito Y. and Isa T., 2003). In addition to this, it still remains unknown to what extent neocortical involvement in the manipulation of the collicular GABAergic system may affect the window in mammals. Presumably, this recruited local inhibition is even further delayed, thus, enabling an even larger window of integration in cats and primates. For such a claim to be stated, however, more needs to be understood on the tectal microcircuit in cats/primates."

However, electroreceptive inputs are also processed at the octavolateral nucleus delaying transmission to the OT at least by one synapse. In both our extracellular and whole-cell patch experiments, we never used the absolute simultaneity but rather always corrected for delays related in conduction of information. However, we agree that direct stimulation of the retina does indeed bypass retinal processing, thus, activating monosynaptically tectal-projecting optic ganglion cells. In a similar manner, when directly stimulating the octavolateral nucleus we are monosynaptically activating tectal-projecting electroreceptive fibers. We align the onsets of the evoked EPSPs by implementing a small delay (usually of the order of 1-5ms) and then perform temporally misaligned offsets to afferent stimulation. What the behavioral advantage of having a faster sensory system (electroreceptive in this case), and if this is true in natural conditions, remains a matter of speculation. Taken together, however, the tectal inhibitory system is equipped with the requisite connections to perform spatiotemporal computations."
