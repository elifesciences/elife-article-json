Here, we show that the lack of regeneration of these populations began ca. 165 ya (around 1850) after major anthropogenic disturbances ceased. Since 1885, less itinerancy and disturbance in the forest has occurred because the colonial administrations concentrated people and villages along the primary communication axes. Local populations formerly gardened the forest by creating scattered openings, which were sufficiently large for the establishment of light-demanding trees. Currently, common logging operations do not create suitable openings for the regeneration of these species, whereas deforestation degrades landscapes. Using an interdisciplinary approach, which included paleoecological, archaeological, historical, and dendrological data, we highlight the long-term history of human activities across central African forests and assess the contribution of these activities to present-day forest structure and composition. The conclusions of this sobering analysis present challenges to current silvicultural practices and to those of the future."

Here, we show that the lack of regeneration of these populations began ca. 165 ya (around 1850) after major anthropogenic disturbances ceased. Since 1885, less itinerancy and disturbance in the forest has occurred because the colonial administrations concentrated people and villages along the primary communication axes. Local populations formerly gardened the forest by creating scattered openings, which were sufficiently large for the establishment of light-demanding trees. Currently, common logging operations do not create suitable openings for the regeneration of these species, whereas deforestation degrades landscapes. Using an interdisciplinary approach, which included paleoecological, archaeological, historical, and dendrological data, we highlight the long-term history of human activities across central African forests and assess the contribution of these activities to present-day forest structure and composition. The conclusions of this sobering analysis present challenges to current silvicultural practices and to those of the future."

As a result this population is aging and at risk of disappearing, which is a major concern. Many light-demanding tree species in the Central African forest are cut down for their valuable timber. However, if young trees do not grow to replace the mature ones that are logged, even logging operations that follow national and international environmental rules cannot guarantee the sustainability of these trees."

This was the case even though the different species grow at different rates, and it means that they all grew from young trees that settled in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century."

By combining information from a number of datasets and historical records, Morin-Rivat et al. arrived at the following conclusion. Before the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, many people lived in the forest and their activities created clearings that turned the forest into a relatively patchy landscape. However from about 1850 onwards, when Europeans started to colonize the region, people and villages were moved out of the forests and closer to rivers and roads for administrative and commercial purposes. Moreover, many people were killed in conflicts or died because of newly introduced diseases, which also led to fewer people in the forest. As a result, the forest became less disturbed. With fewer clearings, fewer light-demanding trees would have had enough access to sunlight to grow to maturity."

These might include selectively logging mature trees around young members of light-demanding species, or planting threatened species."

Over the last three millennia, significant changes in the vegetation structure and floristic composition were caused by climate fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib46\">Maley et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Neumann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">L\u00e9zine et al., 2013</a>). Specifically, a dry event around 2500 ya caused forest fragmentationan event with a more pronounced seasonality occurred around 2500 ya and caused forest fragmentation, and this fragmented forest included patches of savanna (<a href=\"#bib45\">Maley, 2002</a>). This dry episode stopped around 2500 BP, as evidenced from the Mopo Bai site in the Republic of the Congo, where Poaceae pollen severely dropped from 36% to 13% between 2580 and 2400 BP, which is evidence for a retreat of the savannas to the benefit of the forests (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bostoen et al., 2015</a>). After 2000 yrs BP, a relatively wet climate in central Africa favored forest recolonization by light-demanding tree species, with few effects imputable to humans (<a href=\"#bib46\">Maley et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">L\u00e9zine et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brn\u010di\u0107 et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bostoen et al., 2015</a>). The subsequent climatic variations were less important with little effect on the vegetation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Oslisly et al., 2013a</a>); however, human activities are assumed to have increased in importance, particularly during the most recent centuries (<a href=\"#bib54\">Oslisly et al., 2013a,</a>\u00a02013b; <a href=\"#bib78\">Willis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brn\u010di\u0107 et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Greve et al., 2011</a>). The abundance of direct (artifacts) and indirect evidence (charred oil palm endocarps) in soils confirms the non-pristine nature of central African forests (<a href=\"#bib50\">Morin-Rivat\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</a>)."

The light-demanding species form, in some places, almost pure 0.5 to 1 ha stands that mirror the size of traditionally cultivated fields (<a href=\"#bib73\">van Gemerden et al., 2003</a>). An example is the Sangha River Interval (SRI) in which the vegetation currently forms a \u2018corridor\u2019 of old-growth semi-deciduous <i>Celtis</i> forests (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fayolle et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gond et al., 2013</a>), with local variations caused by the geological substrate or the forest degradation along roads and close to cities (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fayolle et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The SRI is a 400-km-wide region, with low endemism between the Lower Guinean and the Congolian subcenters of endemism (<a href=\"#bib76\">White, 1983</a>). This area, which is between southeastern Cameroon, southern Central African Republic and northern Congo, may have been a savanna corridor 2500 ya (<a href=\"#bib45\">Maley, 2002</a>). Until the recent studies of <a href=\"#bib35\">Harris (2002)</a>, and <a href=\"#bib29\">Gillet and\u00a0Doucet\u00a0(2012)</a>, the vegetation in the SRI was under sampled, and whether the origin of this corridor is environmental (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fayolle et al., 2012</a>) or historical (<a href=\"#bib50\">Morin-Rivat\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</a>) remains to be explored. In this study, we assessed the potential impact of historical human activities on central African forests. Specifically, we analyzed the population/age structure of four primary light-demanding timber species across the SRI and examined the synchronism with the paleoenvironmental, archaeological, and historical data in this region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

For growth models, the color of symbols indicates access to light (light gray = emergent and dominant trees, Dawkins 5; gray = canopy and codominant trees, Dawkins 4; black = lower canopy and understory dominated trees, Dawkins\u00a0\u22643). For growth trajectories, age/diameter values based on published tree-ring data are indicated in light gray.

Indeed, a linear relationship between tree diameter and age is acceptable for tropical tree species of a larger size (<a href=\"#bib79\">Worbes et al., 2003</a>). Most suppressed individuals were destined to die, and therefore, only the trees with vigorous growth are able to reach the canopy and could be thus included in this type of analysis.

The Mba\u00e9r\u00e9 valley and the Sadika alluvial fan (Gadzi-Carnot sandstones in CAR) recorded intensive erosion and relatively high \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C values after AD 1200, indicating forest regression and the formation of a forest-savanna mosaic (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sangen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Runge et al., 2014</a>).

The decrease in the run-off with an increased rate of sedimentation between AD 1400 and 1600 corresponds to the climatic period of the Little Ice Age (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brn\u010di\u0107 et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2009</a>), in combination with an increase in the frequency of El-Ni\u00f1o events between AD 1200 and 1500 (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sangen, 2012</a>). Since then, despite a more humid period following the Little Ice Age, maximal incidence of human activities have been recorded in the SRI, which opened the forest cover and favored the pioneers. Nonetheless, we must remain cautious regarding the interpretation of the archaeological data, as there is a huge gap of knowledge in the SRI, especially in the area between Souank\u00e9 and Berberati (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In the state of the art, it is not possible to interpret the spatial distribution of human settlements and activities. In particular, iron-smelting sites are only few, they are concentrated in the southern Central African Republic, and were in use during short periods. The volume of charcoal used and, by extension, the associated deforestation, should have been important for feeding the furnaces, as shown by <a href=\"#bib58\">Pin\u00e7on (1990)</a>. However, the debate is still alive about estimating the volume of wood needed for metallurgy (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lupo et al., 2015</a>), compared to the volume of trees logged for shifting agriculture (<a href=\"#bib31\">Goucher, 1981</a>)."

We hypothesize that the European colonization deeply disturbed the spatial organization of the local populations in central Africa, as demonstrated in Gabon (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pourtier, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Engone Obiang et al., 2014</a>). Colonization stopped the migrations and the interethnic warfare and forced entire groups to settle along rivers and roads for administrative and commercial purposes (<a href=\"#bib74\">Vennetier, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Robineau, 1967</a>). However, the process of village redistribution during the colonial times strongly varied from one place to another, according to the settlement of the colonial posts, and the borders between the French and German possessions (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pourtier, 1989</a>: e.g. of the Fang villages in Gabon). Additional factors can also be invoked to explain the emptying of the forests, including the involvement of local populations in the Franco-German conflicts during their respective colonial expansions and the two World Wars, the forced or voluntarily labor in concession companies, the deadly repression of riots, and the increased mortality because of diseases (e.g., trypanosomiasis along the Ubangui and the Sangha rivers) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Robineau, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Runge and Nguimalet, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Runge, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Runge et al., 2014</a>).

From this period, deep demographic disparities emerged between towns and rural areas: most working-age people went to cities (e.g., Ouesso, Impfondo and Brazzaville in Congo, Yokadouma and Bertoua in Cameroon, and Berberati and Bangui in CAR), while children and the elderly people were left in villages.

Consistent with previous observations in Nigeria (<a href=\"#bib77\">White and Oates, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">van Gemerden et al., 2003</a>), in Gabon (<a href=\"#bib20\">Engone Obiang et al., 2014</a>), and in southwestern Cameroon (<a href=\"#bib4\">Biwol\u00e9\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015</a>), the population decline of light-demanding tree species that now dominate the canopy is explained by the decrease in anthropogenic disturbances. Caution is nevertheless required regarding the interpretation of the radiocarbon signal. Large-scale historical events, such as the interethnic wars and the European colonization of Africa, contributed to reduce human pressure on the forest. Former agricultural activities such as shifting cultivation, which were scattered in the forest areas between AD 1300 and 1850, likely had an indirect positive influence on the regeneration of these species. Past local populations of \u2018foragers-horticulturists\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kay and Kaplan, 2015</a>) gardened the forest by preserving useful light wooded trees (e.g., <i>T. scleroxylon</i>) or dense wooded trees (e.g., <i>P. elata</i> and <i>E. suaveolens</i>) in the fields during forest clearing and therefore created favorable conditions for their recruitment (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carri\u00e8re et al., 2002</a>). Since ca. AD 1850, the reduced disturbance regime has apparently hindered the regeneration of most species of light-demanding trees (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carri\u00e8re et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">van Gemerden et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Willis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brn\u010di\u0107 et al., 2007</a>). The current lack of regeneration and the general aging of the populations threaten both their viability and the sustainability of logging (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hall et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">van Gemerden et al., 2003</a>). Thus, based on these results, a renewed interest in silvicultural practices (<a href=\"#bib18\">Doucet et al., 2004</a>) that create larger openings in the canopy should be inspired. Complementary liberation, thinning treatments, and population enforcement, may also contribute to maintain these timber species (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fayolle et al., 2014a</a>)."

The forest inventories were conducted between 2000 and 2007 with a systematic sampling\u00a0\u22651% of the concession area.

The reforestation was ongoing then [Bostoen et al. 2015 pages 357-358: \u2013 Bostoen (K.), Clist (B.), Doumenge (C.), Grollemund (R.), Hombert (J.-M.), Koni Muluwa (J.) and Maley (J.), 2015, Middle to Late Holocene Paleoclimatic Change and the Early Bantu Expansion in the Rain Forests of Western Central Africa, Current Anthropology, 56 (3), pp.354-384]. J. Maley has previously argued for the existence of two different dry climatic episodes, one around 4000 bp affecting the periphery of the Equatorial forest, the other at 2500 bp affecting the core of it. The data can be used another way, with a start at 4000 bp of the regional dessication ending around 2500 bp with then the largest savanna expanses in position; it would have been a single palaeoclimatic crisis, soon after a slow process of forest regeneration with pioneer trees would have started, i.e. already at 2500 bp."
