Floral abscission is controlled by the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) HAESA and the peptide hormone IDA. It is unknown how expression of IDA in the abscission zone leads to HAESA activation. Here we show that IDA is sensed directly by the HAESA ectodomain. Crystal structures of HAESA in complex with IDA reveal a hormone binding pocket that accommodates an active dodecamer peptide. A central hydroxyproline residue anchors IDA to the receptor. The HAESA co-receptor SERK1, a positive regulator of the floral abscission pathway, allows for high-affinity sensing of the peptide hormone by binding to an Arg-His-Asn motif in IDA. This sequence pattern is conserved among diverse plant peptides, suggesting that plant peptide hormone receptors may share a common ligand binding mode and activation mechanism."

Floral abscission is controlled by the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) HAESA and the peptide hormone IDA. It is unknown how expression of IDA in the abscission zone leads to HAESA activation. Here we show that IDA is sensed directly by the HAESA ectodomain. Crystal structures of HAESA in complex with IDA reveal a hormone binding pocket that accommodates an active dodecamer peptide. A central hydroxyproline residue anchors IDA to the receptor. The HAESA co-receptor SERK1, a positive regulator of the floral abscission pathway, allows for high-affinity sensing of the peptide hormone by binding to an Arg-His-Asn motif in IDA. This sequence pattern is conserved among diverse plant peptides, suggesting that plant peptide hormone receptors may share a common ligand binding mode and activation mechanism."

Santiago et al. used protein biochemistry, structural biology and genetics to uncover how the IDA hormone activates HAESA. The experiments show that IDA binds directly to a canyon shaped pocket in HAESA that extends out from the surface of the cell. IDA binding to HAESA allows another receptor protein called SERK1 to bind to HAESA, which results in the release of signals inside the cell that trigger the shedding of organs."

                        "text": "During their growth, development and reproduction plants use cell separation processes to detach no-longer required, damaged or senescent organs. Abscission of floral organs in Arabidopsis is a model system to study these cell separation processes in molecular detail (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aalen et al., 2013</a>). The LRR-RKs HAESA (greek: to adhere to) and HAESA-LIKE 2 (HSL2) redundantly control floral abscission (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cho et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jinn et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Stenvik et al., 2008</a>). Loss-of-function of the secreted small protein <i>INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (</i>IDA) causes floral organs to remain attached while its over-expression leads to premature shedding (<a href=\"#bib7\">Butenko et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Stenvik et al., 2006</a>). Full-length IDA is proteolytically processed and a conserved stretch of 20 amino-acids (termed EPIP) can rescue the IDA loss-of-function phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stenvik et al., 2008</a>). It has been demonstrated that a dodecamer peptide within EPIP is able to activate HAESA and\u00a0HSL2 in transient assays in tobacco cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Butenko et al., 2014</a>). This sequence motif is highly conserved among IDA family members (IDA-LIKE PROTEINS, IDLs) and contains a central Pro residue, presumed to be post-translationally modified to hydroxyproline (Hyp; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Butenko et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">2014</a>). The available genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that IDA and HAESA together control floral abscission, but it is poorly understood if IDA is directly sensed by the receptor kinase HAESA and how IDA binding at the cell surface would activate the receptor."

                                "text": "We purified the HAESA ectodomain (residues 20\u2013620) from baculovirus-infected insect cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) and quantified the interaction of the ~75\u2009kDa glycoprotein with synthetic IDA peptides using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). A Hyp-modified dodecamer comprising the highly conserved PIP motif in IDA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) interacts with HAESA with 1:1 stoichiometry (N) and with a dissociation constant (K<i><sub>d</sub></i>) of ~20\u2009\u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We next determined crystal structures of the apo HAESA ectodomain and of a HAESA-IDA complex, at 1.74 and 1.86\u2009\u00c5 resolution, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1</a>,<a href=\"#tbl2\">2</a>). IDA binds in a completely extended conformation along the inner surface of the HAESA ectodomain, covering LRRs 2\u201314 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The central Hyp64<sup>IDA</sup> is buried in a specific pocket formed by HAESA LRRs 8\u201310, with its hydroxyl group establishing hydrogen bonds with the strictly conserved Glu266<sup>HAESA</sup> and with a water molecule, which in turn is coordinated by the main chain oxygens of Phe289<sup>HAESA</sup> and Ser311<sup>HAESA</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The restricted size of the Hyp pocket suggests that IDA does not require arabinosylation of Hyp64<sup>IDA</sup> for activity in vivo, a modification that has been reported for Hyp residues in plant CLE peptide hormones (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ohyama et al., 2009</a>). The C-terminal Arg-His-Asn motif in IDA maps to a cavity formed by HAESA LRRs 11\u201314 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,F</a>). The COO<sup>-</sup> group of Asn69<sup>IDA</sup> is in direct contact with Arg407<sup>HAESA</sup> and Arg409<sup>HAESA</sup> and HAESA cannot bind a C-terminally extended IDA-SFVN peptide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2D</a>). This suggests that the conserved Asn69<sup>IDA</sup> may constitute the very C-terminus of the mature IDA peptide <i>in planta</i> and that active IDA is generated by proteolytic processing from a longer pre-protein (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stenvik et al., 2008</a>). Mutation of Arg417<sup>HSL2</sup> (which corresponds to Arg409<sup>HAESA</sup>) causes a loss-of-function phenotype in HSL2, which indicates that the peptide binding pockets in different HAESA receptors have common structural and sequence features (<a href=\"#bib36\">Niederhuth et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, we find many of the residues contributing to the formation of the IDA binding surface in HAESA to be conserved in HSL2 and in\u00a0other HAESA-type receptors in different plant species (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). A N-terminal Pro-rich motif in IDA makes contacts with\u00a0LRRs 2\u20136 of the receptor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). Other hydrophobic and polar interactions are mediated by Ser62<sup>IDA</sup>, Ser65<sup>IDA</sup> and by backbone atoms along the IDA peptide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>)."

Calculations were performed in R (<a href=\"#bib40\">R Core Team, 2014</a>) (version 3.2.3). (<b>B</b>) Analytical size-exclusion chromatography. The HAESA LRR domain elutes as a monomer (black dotted line), as does the isolated SERK1 ectodomain (blue dotted line). A HAESA \u2013 IDA \u2013 SERK1 complex elutes as an apparent heterodimer (red line), while a mixture of HAESA and SERK1 yields two isolated peaks that correspond to monomeric HAESA and SERK1, respectively (black line). Void (V<sub>0</sub>) volume and total volume (V<sub>t</sub>) are shown, together with elution volumes for molecular mass standards (A, Thyroglobulin, 669,000 Da; B, Ferritin, 440,00 Da, C, Aldolase, 158,000 Da; D, Conalbumin, 75,000 Da; E, Ovalbumin, 44,000 Da; F, Carbonic anhydrase, 29,000 Da). A SDS PAGE of the peak fractions is shown alongside. Purified HAESA and SERK1 are ~75 and ~28 kDa, respectively. (<b>C</b>) Isothermal titration calorimetry of wild-type and Hyp64<span class=\"underline\">\u2192</span>Pro IDA versus the HAESA and SERK1 ectodomains. The titration of IDA wild-type versus the isolated HAESA ectodomain from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> is shown for comparison (red line; n.d. no detectable binding) (<b>D</b>) Analytical size-exclusion chromatography in the presence of the IDA Hyp64<span class=\"underline\">\u2192</span>Pro mutant peptide reveals no complex formation between HAESA and SERK1 ectodomains. A SDS PAGE of the peak fractions is shown alongside. (<b>E</b>) In vitro kinase assays of the HAESA and SERK1 kinase domains. Wild-type HAESA and SERK1 kinase domains (KDs) exhibit auto-phosphorylation activities (lanes 1 + 3). Mutant (m)\u00a0versions, which carry point mutations in their active sites (Asp837<sup>HAESA</sup>\u2192Asn, Asp447<sup>SERK1</sup>\u2192Asn) possess no autophosphorylation activity (lanes 2+4). Transphosphorylation activity from the active kinase to the mutated form can be observed in both directions (lanes 5+6). A coomassie-stained gel loading control is shown below."

It has been recently reported that SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASES (SERKs) are positive regulators of floral abscission and can interact with HAESA and HSL2 in an IDA-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib33\">Meng et al., 2016</a>). As all five SERK family members appear to be expressed in the Arabidopsis abscission zone (<a href=\"#bib37\">Niederhuth et al., 2013</a>), we quantified their relative contribution to floral abscission in Arabidopsis using a petal break-strength assay (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lease et al., 2006</a>). Our experiments suggest that among the SERK family members, SERK1 is a positive regulator of floral abscission. We found that the force required to remove the petals of <i>serk1-1</i> mutants is significantly higher than that needed for wild-type plants, as previously observed for <i>haesa/hsl2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stenvik et al., 2008</a>), and that floral abscission is delayed in <i>serk1-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The <i>serk2-2, serk3-1, serk4-1 and serk5-1</i> mutant lines (<a href=\"#bib3\">Albrecht et al., 2008</a>) showed a petal break-strength profile not significantly different from wild-type plants. Possibly because SERKs have additional roles in plant development such as in pollen formation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albrecht et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Colcombet et al., 2005</a>) and brassinosteroid signaling (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gou et al., 2012</a>), we found that higher-order SERK mutants exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes in the flower (<a href=\"#bib32\">Meng et al., 2015</a>), rendering their analysis and comparison by quantitative petal break-strength assays difficult.

We next quantified the contribution of SERK1 to IDA recognition by HAESA. We found that HAESA senses IDA with a ~60\u00a0fold higher binding affinity in the presence of SERK1, suggesting that SERK1 is involved in the specific recognition of the peptide hormone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We next titrated SERK1 into a solution containing only the HAESA ectodomain. In this case, there was no detectable interaction between receptor and co-receptor, while in the presence of IDA, SERK1 strongly binds HAESA with a dissociation constant in the mid-nanomolar range (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This suggests that IDA itself promotes receptor \u2013 co-receptor association, as previously described for the steroid hormone brassinolide (<a href=\"#bib43\">Santiago et al., 2013</a>) and for other LRR-RK complexes (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2015</a>).

The fact that SERK1 specifically interacts with the very C-terminus of IDLs may allow for the rational design of peptide hormone antagonists, as previously demonstrated for the brassinosteroid pathway (<a href=\"#bib35\">Muto and Todoroki, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Santiago et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, our calorimetry assays reveal that the SERK1 ectodomain binds HAESA with nanomolar affinity, but only in the presence of IDA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This ligand-induced formation of a receptor \u2013 co-receptor complex may allow the HAESA and SERK1 kinase domains to efficiently trans-phosphorylate and activate each other in the cytoplasm. It is of note that our reported binding affinities for IDA and SERK1 have been measured using synthetic peptides and the isolated HAESA and SERK1 ectodomains, and thus\u00a0might differ in the context of the full-length, membrane-embedded signaling complex."

Several residues in the SERK1\u2009N-terminal capping domain (Thr59<sup>SERK1</sup>, Phe61<sup>SERK1</sup>) and the\u00a0LRR inner surface (Asp75<sup>SERK1</sup>, Tyr101<sup>SERK1</sup>, SER121<sup>SERK1</sup>, Phe145<sup>SERK1</sup>) contribute to the formation of both complexes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Santiago et al., 2013</a>). In addition, residues 53-55<sup>SERK1</sup> from the SERK1\u2009N-terminal cap mediate specific interactions with the IDA peptide (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6B</a>). These residues are not involved in the sensing of the steroid hormone brassinolide (<a href=\"#bib43\">Santiago et al., 2013</a>). In both cases however, the co-receptor completes the hormone binding pocket. This fact together with the largely overlapping SERK1 binding surfaces in HAESA and BRI1 allows us to speculate that SERK1 may promote high-affinity peptide hormone and brassinosteroid sensing by simply slowing down dissociation of the ligand from its cognate receptor."

                                "text": "Coding sequences of SERK1 kinase domain (SERK1-KD) (residues 264\u2013625) and HAESA-KD (residues 671\u2013969) were cloned into a modified pET (Novagen) vector providing an TEV-cleavable N-terminal 8xHis-StrepII-Thioredoxin tag. Point mutations were introduced into the SERK1 (Asp447\u2192Asn; mSERK1) and HAESA (Asp837\u2192Asn; mHAESA) coding sequences by site directed mutagenesis, thereby rendering the kinases inactive (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bojar et al., 2014</a>). The plasmids were transformed into <i>E.coli</i> Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Novagen). Protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to final concentration of 0.5\u2009mM to cell cultures grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6. Cells were then incubated at 16\u00b0C for 18\u00a0hr, pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 x g and 4\u00b0C for 15\u2009min, and resuspended in buffer A (20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 500\u2009mM NaCl, 4\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 2\u2009mM \u03b2-Mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 15\u2009mM Imidazole and 0.1% (v/v) Igepal. After cell lysis by sonication, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 35,000 x g and 4\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. The recombinant proteins were isolated by Co<sup>2+</sup> metal affinity purification using a combination of batch and gravity flow approaches (HIS-Select Cobalt Affinity Gel, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After washing the resin with the wash buffer (buffer A + 15\u2009mM Imidazole) proteins were eluted in buffer A supplemented with 250\u2009mM Imidazole. All elutions were then dialyzed against 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250\u2009mM NaCl, 4\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5\u2009mM TCEP. For SERK1-KD and mSERK1-KD the 8xHis-StrepII-Thioredoxin tag was removed with 6xHis tagged TEV protease. TEV and the cleaved tag were removed by a second metal affinity purification step. Subsequently, all proteins were purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column equilibrated in 20\u2009mM Tris pH 8, 250\u2009mM NaCl, 4\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5\u2009mM TCEP. Peak fractions were collected and concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugation devices (10,000 MWCO). For in vitro kinase assays, 1\u2009\u03bcg of HAESA-KD, 0.25\u2009\u03bcg of SERK1-KD and 2\u2009\u03bcg of mSERK1 and mHAESA were used in a final reaction volume of 20\u2009\u03bcl. The reaction buffer consisted of 20\u2009mM Tris pH 8, 250\u2009mM NaCl, 4\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5\u2009mM TCEP. The reactions were started by the addition of 4 \u03bcCi [\u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA), incubated at room temperature for 45\u2009min and stopped by the addition of 6x SDS-loading dye immediately followed by incubating the samples at 95\u00b0C. Proteins of the whole reaction were subsequently separated via SDS-PAGE in 4\u201315% gradient gels (TGX, Biorad, Hercules, CA) and stained with Instant Blue (Expedeon, San Diego, CA). After pictures were taken of the stained gel, <sup>32</sup>P-derived signals were visualized by exposing the gel to an X-ray film (Fuji, SuperRX, Valhalla, NY)."

Expression levels were normalized using the CT values obtained for the <i>actin2</i> gene (forward: TGCCAATCTACGAGGGTTTC; reverse: TTCTCGATGGAAGAGCTGGT). For detection and amplification of IDA sequence we used specific primers (forward: TCGTACGATGATGGTTCTGC; reverse: GAATGGGAACGCCTTTAGGT).

Through an array of complex structures, supplemented with biochemical and genetic experiments, the authors uncovered the IDA recognition mechanism by a co-receptor (HAESA and SERK1) detection mechanism. The structures also reveal the specific recognition mechanism of the 12-residue IDA core peptide sequence by the co-receptors, and suggest that this 12-residue IDA sequence is likely to be the mature peptide hormone functioning in plants. The comparison of the structures of the HAESA/SERK1/IDA complex and the previously determined BRA1/SERK1/brassinolide complex by the same group also suggests a co-receptor pairing mechanism for various plant hormones. The story gives detailed and novel mechanistic insights in the perception of IDA during floral abscission, and is convincing and worthy to be considered for publication in <i>eLife</i> with the following revisions."

We would like to note that due to the many N-glycosylation sites dispersed over the HAESA LRR domain (shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), we find relatively few crystal contacts in our P3121 crystal form, which may rationalize our high B-values. We have reanalyzed our space group assignment (using the CCP4 program ZANUDA) and checked for any signs of problems during data collection (ice rings, multiple crystal lattices, splitting, using the programs XDS and XDSSTAT), as well as for twinning and pseudosymmetry (using phenix.xtriage). No such problems appear to exist, our structures refine very well and our refined B-values are in good agreement with our Wilson B-factors (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Thus, the high B-values appear to represent an intrinsic property of our crystals and are not the result of a poor data collection strategy or inappropriate crystallographic analysis."

Previously reported negative regulators of abscission, such as the transcription factor <i>KNAT1</i>, have an earlier reduction in breakstrength, indicative of early cell wall remodeling (Shi et al. 2011). Our results show that <i>serk1</i> mutant plants, contrary to <i>knat1</i> mutants and wild type, have a delay in cell wall loosening and organ separation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) thus positively regulating organ separation during abscission.

Our work does not rule out a function for SERK1 in such a parallel pathway, we merely report SERK1 can ALSO act as a positive regulator of abscission by interacting with HAESA in an IDA-dependent manner. We do not observe negative regulation of floral abscission using our SERK1 mutant alleles.

Biochem., 2006) (see Methods, subsection \u201cProtein Expression and Purification\u201c). Both the native signal peptides for SERK1 and HAESA as well as the azurocidin signal peptide are being recognized and cleaved by the <i>Trichoplusia ni</i> signal peptidase. This results, just like <i>in planta</i>, in a mature receptor/coreceptor ectodomain starting with the first \u03b1-helix of the N-terminal capping domain (residues 20 and 24, respectively). Thus, there is no reason to believe that the signal peptide would play a role in IDA sensing. Using our system, we cannot produce HAESA and/or SERK1 ectodomains with an intact signal peptide, as this would impair folding and proper secretion of the recombinant proteins."
