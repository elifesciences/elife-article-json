Such learning is believed to emerge from alterations in network connectivity, but large-scale connectivity is difficult to measure directly, especially during learning. Here, we show that area CA1 cells converge to time-locked firing sequences that bridge the two stimuli paired during training, and this phenomenon is coupled to a reorganization of network correlations. Using two-photon calcium imaging of mouse hippocampal neurons we find that co-time-tuned neurons exhibit enhanced spontaneous activity correlations that increase just prior to learning. While time-tuned cells are not spatially organized, spontaneously correlated cells do fall into distinct spatial clusters that change as a result of learning. We propose that the spatial re-organization of correlation clusters reflects global network connectivity changes that are responsible for the emergence of the sequentially-timed activity of cell-groups underlying the learned behavior."

After many pairings of these stimuli, the subject learns to blink in response to the tone, even though the tone and puff never overlap in time (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tseng et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kalmbach et al., 2009</a>).

The first model hypothesizes that the representation of the first stimulus is maintained by the sustained firing of stimulus-selective cells through a trace interval (<a href=\"#bib44\">Solomon et al., 1986</a>). Such a model is supported by observations of sustained firing by neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fuster, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baeg et al., 2003</a>) and the medial entorhinal cortex (<a href=\"#bib14\">Egorov et al., 2002</a>) during working memory tasks. An alternative model proposes that sensory representations are maintained by the sequential activation of groups of neurons (<a href=\"#bib32\">Levy et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Howe and Levy, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">MacDonald et al., 2013</a>). This view arose from modeling studies that trained simple hippocampal area CA3 network models on the trace conditioning task. Rather than observing sustained firing, the authors found that groups of neurons began to show activity in well-timed, sequential bouts. Neurons representing the CS kicked off this \u2018relay\u2019 of activation, which eventually activated US representing neurons at the appropriate time (<a href=\"#bib32\">Levy et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Howe and Levy, 2007</a>).

There has also been a series of recent, more closely related studies of hippocampal activity, in which rats or monkeys performed stimulus-retention tasks where they had to remember an odor or visual stimulus in order to receive a reward. Here too, hippocampal CA1 neurons were observed to be active in stimulus-triggered, time-locked sequences (<a href=\"#bib36\">MacDonald et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Naya and Suzuki, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kraus et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">MacDonald et al., 2013</a>). It is increasingly clear that hippocampal CA1 cells adopt sequential activity patterns when subjects are placed in a behavioral context requiring the bridging of temporally separated stimuli. However, in all the studies where this has been observed, only well-trained subjects were used, leaving the time course and mechanism of the emergence of sequentially timed activity entirely unknown."

In a study using two photon calcium imaging of motor cortex pyramidal neuron activity, changes in spontaneous activity correlations have been inferred to indicate learning-related circuit plasticity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Komiyama et al., 2010</a>). In another study where rats were exploring a novel track, correlations between pairs of place cells increased with increasing exposure to the novel environment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng and Frank, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</a>). With the ability to measure changes in input from upstream circuits using spontaneous activity correlations across many cells in the network, two-photon recordings allow the testing of predictions from the model proposed for the emergence of sequential activity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Levy et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Howe and Levy, 2007</a>). Furthermore, such recordings provide relative cell locations within the hippocampus, allowing one to examine the spatial organization of activity patterns (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hampson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brivanlou et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kjelstrup et al., 2008</a>).

In this study, we train mice on a trace eyeblink conditioning task while recording activity from populations of area CA1 neurons using two photon calcium imaging. In order to eliminate the influence of running or changing spatial position on hippocampal activity, we implemented a trace eye-blink conditioning task for head-fixed mice. Further, our activity measurements revealed CA1 network dynamics during learning, as we began with na\u00efve mice and trained them to criterion within the recording session. We found that sequentially timed activity of groups of area CA1 cells emerged progressively during the course of learning. Additionally, mean spontaneous activity correlations at the network level rose transiently, while only the correlations between co-tuned cells remained elevated towards the end of the session. Finally, we observed spatially organized clusters of neurons that had elevated spontaneous activity correlations. These correlation clusters re-organized during learning."

Furthermore, the trial at which a mouse has learned the task is statistically defined. It is the first trial when the lower 95% confidence interval of the probability of CR production rises and remains above chance.

First, we determined whether or not cells showed sustained activity through the entire period of interest by measuring how wide each cell\u2019s response was at half the amplitude of the peak of the response. The mean response width measured in this manner was found to be 120 ms \u00b1 81 ms (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 542 cells, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Only three cells (\u223c0.5%, of all cells) had response widths greater than 600 ms, the length of the period from tone-onset to puff-onset. Based on this analysis, we concluded that sustained cell activation is not the mechanism used by the hippocampus to maintain a stimulus representation. We next looked for indications of sequential activation. Prior to learning, calcium response peaks were not reliably timed across trials, relative to tone onset (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, left panel). Post learning, however, we observed that area CA1 cells had activity peaks at fixed time-points relative to tone onset, seen consistently across multiple trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel). We further characterized this by averaging these \u0394F/F activity traces over trials and identifying activity peaks within the time window from tone onset to 200 milliseconds after puff onset. We rank ordered cells based on the timings of their activity peaks and found that small groups of cells firing at each time-point, tiled the entire interval of interest (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). When the same procedure (averaging followed by sorting by timing) was carried out on traces from the pre-training dataset, tiling was markedly skewed with most cells (66% in this case) showing activity peaks during the tone period (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Furthermore, if neurons in the pre-training dataset were ordered as per timing of peaks in the training session, no clear tiling was visible (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). This indicated that timings of peak activity of area CA1 cells, relative to the onset of tone stimulus, changed during training. Furthermore, at the population level, these peak times appeared to tile the interval of interest between tone and puff."

We then quantified the reliability with which cells fired at their respective PTs, from trial to trial (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> shows a cell reliably firing at a particular PT). First, we reasoned that if cells show time-aligned activity, the peak of the trial-averaged \u0394F/F trace would be higher than if activity were not reliably timed. Hence, we computed the peaks of the averaged \u0394F/F traces during the tone-onset to puff-onset period (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The mean peak amplitude for cells from trace conditioned mice was significantly higher than for cells from pseudo-conditioned mice or for spontaneous activity data (trace = 0.022 \u00b1 0.007, pseudo = 0.017 \u00b1 0.009, spontaneous = 0.015 \u00b1 0.008; mean \u00b1 SEM; one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey Kramer honest significant difference (h.s.d.) p&lt;0.01).

Plotted here is the mean, absolute difference between these local peak timings and the final activity peak timings for cells from trace learners (blue), pseudo-conditioned mice (green), spontaneous activity (red) and non-learners (cyan). The solid curves depict mean values and the shaded areas, SEM. Final activity peak timings were computed using trials after the learning trial. (<b>F</b>) Activity peak timings early in the session are different from final, learning-related peak timings. Activity peak timings were calculated for the early half of the session by averaging activity traces for trials 1 to 25. The final peak timing for each cell was determined by averaging every alternate trial from trials 26 to 50. These two sets of peak-timings were then compared with the final, post-learning peak timings determined by averaging a non-overlapping set of trials from the 26\u201350 trial window. The absolute differences in peak timing have been plotted for trace learners (blue), pseudo-conditioned mice (green), spontaneous activity (red) and non-learners (cyan). For trace learners, the mean timing-difference is significantly higher for peak timings determined early in the session (solid colored bars) than for those determined in the latter half (bars with black hatch pattern). Peak timing difference does not decrease for all controls. The red line indicates the average frame time across datasets (* indicates p&lt;0.01).

However, it must be pointed out that if sequence replay events are rare in comparison to spontaneous activity of area CA1 cells, then the correlation analysis described above, coupled with the limited size of our dataset (to minimize calcium indicator dye photo-bleaching) might not have the statistical power to detect them. Furthermore, spontaneous, sequential replay activity could still be occurring, but at an accelerated time-scale, as has been observed before (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee and Wilson, 2002</a>).

This has been observed previously in the context of rats repeatedly exploring a novel track (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng and Frank, 2008</a>). Here, the reduction in spontaneous activity correlations was ascribed to a reduction in the novelty of the particular congruence of stimuli related to the track being explored. Hence, the reduction in noise correlations we observe could also be a post-learning phenomenon, related to a reduction in the novelty of the specific congruence of the paired CS and US stimuli. To support this interpretation, we ruled out possible technical contributors to the reduction in correlations. First, the reduction in correlations were not due to a gradual decline in the quality of optical activity recordings, since we found that recordings remained stable through the training session, as discussed in \u2018Results: Cells in hippocampal area CA1 imaged from awake, behaving mice exhibit temporal tuning\u2019; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>. Second, this effect was not due to mice paying less attention to the task or fatiguing towards the end of the session. We tested this by measuring the sizes and peak latencies of the significant blinks before and after trial 25, where the decline in spontaneous correlations was seen to begin. Mean significant blink sizes before and after trial 25 were not significantly different (mean normalized early blink size = 1.03 \u00b1 0.06, late = 0.95 \u00b1 0.03, mean \u00b1 SEM; two sample <i>t</i> test p=0.62; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Additionally, mean significant blink peak latency from the time of tone onset did not change from the first to the second half of the session (early latency = 565.3 \u00b1 68.5 ms, late latency = 538.7 \u00b1 92.3 ms; mean \u00b1 SEM; two sample <i>t</i> test p=0.80; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Hence, we concluded that blink responses remained stable across the two halves of the session, and that a lack of sustained attention was not likely to be the cause of the reduction in noise correlations."

We considered spontaneous activity data from three segments of the session comprising early, middle and late blocks of trials. We then measured the similarity between pairs of matched clusters obtained using data from different trial blocks. The similarity score measured the mean fraction of neurons belonging to clusters matched across these blocks, normalized to the mean overlap between random cell-clusters of the same sizes. For example, a high similarity score for a cluster (&gt;&gt; 1) would indicate a similarity much greater than chance, implying that this cluster is well preserved from one trial block to the next. Interestingly, we found highly reliable groupings (i.e., high similarity scores) in the pre-training session datasets, indicating stable patterns of input from upstream neuronal populations (example in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) prior to training. In contrast, cell-groupings changed drastically during the trace conditioning session (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>), and were significantly less stable than those in the pre-training datasets. For pseudo-conditioned mice, cell groupings were reliable throughout the training session datasets (ANOVA followed by Tukey Kramer h.s.d., p&lt;0.01; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). Thus, spatially organized, correlated cell-clusters exist prior to and during learning.

Previous work had identified neurons that were primarily air-puff responsive early in training, but became progressively more tone responsive as training proceeded. This process was thought to ascribe US valence to the CS (<a href=\"#bib37\">McEchron and Disterhoft, 1999</a>). The progressive changes in neuronal activity timing we observed are consistent with this finding, as a small subset of neurons did indeed shift from being tone to puff responsive (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013I</a>). However, the predominant learning-related change we observed was the emergence of sequentially timed activity of groups of neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>). Here, we note that calcium response recordings typically have a time resolution of about 100 ms, a time window within which entire sequences of neuronal activation have been known to occur (<a href=\"#bib16\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>). Hence, we interpret our data to be indicative of sequential activity with respect to time-windows comparable to the average frame time (74 ms) of our recordings. Even at our lower time resolution, the total space of possible sequences is very large. Our study thus indicates that a very small fraction of all possible sequences is important for successful trace conditioning. Grouped by activity peaks within \u223c70 ms time-windows, neurons might show finer-scale sequences or even fluctuations that would not be visible in our recordings. However, at the time-scale of a few hundred milliseconds relevant to trace conditioning, area CA1 cells show progressively emerging activity sequences after network re-organization during learning."

Stimulus representation by sequential activity would also allow for the association of two temporally separated stimuli, by maintaining a representation of the first stimulus until the arrival of the second one. This would then allow Hebbian plasticity to strengthen synapses linking the neurons associated with the non-stationary, sequential stimulus representation. This stimulus maintenance is necessary since Hebbian plasticity cannot occur with stimuli separated by over \u223c100 ms (<a href=\"#bib31\">Levy and Steward, 1983</a>)."

Notably, in these studies, the tone stimulus triggers a well-timed relay of CA3 cell activation that culminates in the activation of US representing neurons.

While high temporal resolution measurements of neuronal activity are required to infer direct, synaptic connectivity, we, in our study, infer changes in NC to be indicative of changes in clustering of inputs to CA1 cells from upstream CA3 cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Komiyama et al., 2010</a>). This view is consistent with earlier findings where the correlations between place cell pairs were seen to increase as rats explored a novel track (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng and Frank, 2008</a>). Importantly, this increase in correlations was dependent on the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and, therefore, the capacity for synaptic plasticity in area CA3 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</a>). We found that cell-pairs that eventually share the same time-tuning show significantly higher increases in NC than do random cell-pairs, though on average, all cell-pairs show a significant increase in pair-wise correlations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). We interpret this to be due to increased common input from changing groupings of inter-connected CA3 neurons. However, this increase is temporary as average NC declines near the end of the session, although neurons sharing the same time-tuning still maintain significantly elevated NC. This is consistent with a previous observation that novelty-induced increases in spontaneous correlations gradually reduce with repeated exposure to the novel environment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng and Frank, 2008</a>). The transient, global increase in NC may arise from a network-wide increase in synaptic weights during learning, and the subsequent decline may reflect weakening of mean synaptic weights due to synaptic re-normalization (schematic in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Consistent with this interpretation, we observed that mean NC peaked just prior to the peaks in behavioral responsiveness and reliability of sequential activity, even on an individual mouse basis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

This is borne out by the observation of spatially segregated connectivity from CA3 to CA1 cells in hippocampal slices (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brivanlou et al., 2004</a>). Importantly, we observed that these spatially segregated clusters changed only during learning, while in pseudo-conditioned mice and in data collected prior to training, NC clusters remained relatively constant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This indicates that during learning, area CA1 cells (and probably also, by extension, CA3 cells) enter a dynamic state, where neurons change from one spatially-organized, correlated grouping to another (schematic in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

Temperature was maintained using a heating-pad (TR-200, Fine Science Tools, Canada). Dexamethasone 5 mg/kg body weight was injected sub-cutaneously to minimize swelling and bleeding prior to the surgery. The mouse was then head-fixed (Item 51547; Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) and a custom designed brass head-bar was affixed to the skull using skull-screws (83,438; Micro-Mark, Berkeley Heights, NJ, USA) and dental acrylic. The dorsal hippocampal surface (ipsi-lateral to the side of tone and air-puff delivery) was exposed through a craniotomy (2.0 mm posterior to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral to the mid-line [ipsi-lateral to the side of stimulus delivery]; diameter \u223c 1\u20131.5 mm) after gently aspirating away over-lying cortex to expose the external capsule (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dombeck et al., 2007</a>). Exposed brain-matter was constantly irrigated with cortex buffer (CB; in mM: NaCl\u2013125, KCl\u20135, glucose\u201310, HEPES\u201310, CaCl2\u20132 and MgCl2\u20132. pH set to 7.35 with NaOH) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Holtmaat et al., 2005</a>). A fluorescent indicator of calcium (O6807; Oregon Green BAPTA-1 AM ester, Molecular Probes - Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) was bolus loaded by pressure injection into the hippocampus, at a depth of \u223c100 \u00b5m. Pressure injections were delivered using glass pipettes with tip impedances of 2\u20133 Mohms and pressure pulses of 5\u201310 psi for 3 to 5 min (Picospritzer-III, Parker-Hannifin, Cleveland, OH, USA). Dye solution was prepared by solubilizing 50 \u00b5g of dye (one vial) in 5 \u00b5l of a detergent (P-3000MP; 20% Pluronic acid, Invitrogen - Life Technologies), and then diluting down to 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l by adding 45 \u00b5l of CB. The gap left behind by aspirated cortex was then filled by pouring molten, low-melting agarose solution (A9414; 5% in CB, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) into the craniotomy and covering with a 5 mm, circular cover-slip (CS-5R; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA). The cover-slip was then fixed in place with dental acrylic. A fragment from a freshly shattered Neodymium magnet was affixed to the left, upper-eyelid using cyano-acrylate glue. Dexamethasone (5 (\u00b1 2) \u00b5g/g body weight) was injected sub-cutaneously to minimize swelling and bleeding at the beginning of the surgery. Fortwin (Pentazoncine, 5 \u00b5g/g body weight) was administered sub-cutaneously at the end of the surgery, as an analgesic. The mouse was then released and given 95% O<sub>2</sub> to breathe until vigorous toe-pinch responses were seen and was then transferred to a closed cage with food and water for 1.5\u20132 hr, to recover before imaging began. OGB-1 dye, once loaded into neurons, allows imaging for a limited period before clearance from neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stosiek et al., 2003</a>). This limited the viability of the imaging preparation to a few hours, corresponding to a single behavioral session."

Left eyelid blink responses were recorded using a custom-made magnetometer (<a href=\"#bib27\">Koekkoek et al., 2002</a>) positioned close to (1\u20133 mm away) the neodymium magnet fragment glued to the eyelid and was left un-disturbed throughout the experiment. The magnetometer was constructed using a magneto-resistive sensor (HMC1051Z; Honeywell, Linden, NJ, USA), whose output was further amplified (SR560; Stanford Research Systems) and digitized at 10 KHz using a data acquisition card (PCI-6221; National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). The tone, conditioned stimulus was delivered using a speaker positioned to the left of the mouse. The stimulus was a pure tone of frequency 9.5 KHz, delivered at an intensity of 80\u201390 dB at the microscope stage and of 350 ms duration. In a pre-training session, only tones were delivered for 30 trials. Blink responses were acquired for 5 s prior to tone onset and terminated 10 s after tone onset. The inter-trial interval was randomized between 15 and 30 s, making the total duration between tone-presentations 30 to 45 s. Thereafter, a single trace conditioning session of 50 trials was carried out. On training trials a 100 ms air-puff (aversive, un-conditioned stimulus), was delivered 250 ms (trace interval) after the end of the tone. Pressurized air at 5 psi was passed through a nozzle of tip-diameter 1\u20131.5 mm positioned \u223c1\u20132 cm away and aimed at the mouse\u2019s left eye. Air-flow was switched on and off with a computer-controlled electronic, solenoid valve (EV mouse valve, Clippard, Cinncinati, OH, USA). Every fifth trial was a probe trial (on which no puff was delivered) however as these amounted to only 10 probe trials per mouse, data from these trials have not been used for any specific analysis. Only one training session of 50 trials was carried out per mouse. Longer sessions were seen to cause blinking fatigue and discomfort to the mice. Additional sessions over multiple days were not possible due to the acute nature of the imaging preparation (\u2018Materials and methods: Mice and surgical procedure\u2019). All trained mice were imaged, irrespective of usability of imaging data, while training was carried out. Microscope scan-mirrors continued to oscillate during the inter-trial interval, to remove auditory cues signaling the beginning or end of a trial."

The decoder\u2019s performance was scored by taking the dot product corresponding to the current frame number (correct frame) and dividing it by the summed dot products corresponding to in-correct frame numbers, weighted by distance from the correct frame. The correct frame dot product was given a weight equal to the total weight given to incorrect frame dot products. Incorrect frame dot product weights increased linearly with distance from correct frame, starting two frames away. As a control, dot-product vectors were randomly scrambled and performance score calculated. This was repeated 500 times and averaged to get the mean random-control performance score. In this manner, prediction scores were calculated for all single-frame prvs from all the remaining trials, not used to construct the expected population response template."

A 4 s long stretch of the \u0394F/F trace for each cell was taken from a period &gt;4 s away from tone or puff delivery from each considered trial. The traces for a cell were stitched together for groups of trials and correlation coefficients were calculated for each pair of these, extended traces. In this way, noise correlations were computed for all appropriate cell pairs in each dataset. Trial-groups were considered as described in <a href=\"#fig4 fig6\">Figure 4A, and 6A,B</a>. Note that for most analyses involving spontaneous activity correlations, cells were not discarded on the basis of their reliability scores as in the case of time-tuning analyses. The only exception is the analysis for <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>. Here, neurons were classified into two groups, one with high activity timing reliability scores, and the other with low activity timing reliability scores. Spontaneous activity correlations were then calculated for pairs of neurons within each group that shared the same activity peak timing."

Briefly, the k means ++ algorithm (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007</a>) was initialized with k = 3 and was run 2000 times to generate clusters, after which cell-pairs falling into the same k-means ++ cluster for &gt;80% of iterations were placed into \u2018meta-clusters\u2019. We also initialized k-means ++ with k = 2 and k = 4, and similar results were obtained. These meta-clusters were then iteratively combined using pair-wise correlation coefficient as a criterion, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dombeck et al., 2009</a>) to yield the final clusters. Since the final clusters are formed by iterative pooling of meta-clusters, the number of clusters does not need to be pre-specified. The number of clusters obtained ranged from 2 to 8, while the k-value used to initialize k-means ++ in the reported data was 3."

First, the proportion of neurons belonging in common to both clusters was calculated, followed by calculating the overlap seen by chance, when random neurons were assigned to equal sized clusters. This is because overlap expected by chance depends on the numbers and sizes of clusters. The ratio of these two overlap measures was defined as the similarity score. In order to match clusters across trial sets, all possible combinations of cluster pairing in the two datasets were considered, and the one with the highest overlap proportion was used to calculate the similarity scores."

The calculation of intervals accounts for the increased chances of type-1 errors due to multiple comparisons. Since 99% confidence intervals were calculated, the chance of error is smaller than 1%.

Since the US and CS are separated in time, they must be linked by neural activity in the intervening period. The authors find that relatively uncoordinated activity in CA1 reorganizes into a reliable sequential firing pattern that spans the time between CS and US, which they propose bridges this time interval. This paper offers two main contributions. First, observing these firing patterns during eyeblink conditioning expands the range of behavioral paradigms where sequences are observed, emphasizing their generality and hippocampal involvement in linking time-separated events. Second, the authors directly observe how sequential activity emerges over training. They find parallel changes in the structure of spontaneous correlations, implying changes in functional connectivity of the hippocampal network. While as the authors note, correlations do not definitively establish the nature of these changes, it does point towards redistributed functional interactions."

An even better approach would incorporate the sophisticated learning curve analysis used by Wirth et al. (Science, 2003) which tracks correct learning responses and would likely allow you to use eyeblink magnitude directly without setting an arbitrary threshold for CR or no-CR. This is viewed as important because you use the trial on which learning occurs to make conclusions about whether time cells precede or follow learning."

These data could help address whether learning increases reliability of pre-existing responses already tied to specific time points (i.e., reinforces a pre-existing sequence), vs reconfigures activity by shifting peaks in time or generating new responses. The data point strongly to reconfiguration but some more in-depth analysis addressing this could be a nice addition. For example: <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> shows an interesting single-cell example where firing occurs at similar times across trials, but more reliably after learning. The reliability score will tend to collapse differences in probability at the same time, vs changes in timing (or reliability of timing) of peaks, into a single number. It would be useful to address these separately \u2013 e.g., comparing the variability in peak times for each neuron across trials, before and after training and/or comparing the change in peak time. Does learning primarily affect mean timing of activity, variability of timing across trials, or reliability at a specific time point?"

However, we would like to point out that the meta k-means clustering algorithm used in our study does not need the user to pre-specify the number of clusters that cells are allotted to (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ozden, Lee, et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dombeck, Graziano, et al., 2009</a>). The algorithm relies on an initial step of repeated clustering by the k-means++ algorithm with pre-specified numbers of clusters (step 1 in <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>). This is the k value range of 2-4 referred to by the reviewers. After 2000 randomly initialized runs of the k-means++ algorithm, we get many different sets of clusters. The meta k-means algorithm then identifies cells that are co-clustered in more than 80% of k-means ++ runs and groups them into meta clusters initially. These meta clusters are then iteratively merged, based on the similarity of their averaged, activity traces, to yield a variable, unspecified number of final clusters, of un-specified sizes. The average number of correlation clusters we obtained using this algorithm ranged from 2 to 8, whereas the k-value used to initialize k-means++ was 3. Furthermore, we would like to point out that the central finding we report does not depend on the number of clusters per se, but rather on their relative spatial organization and whether or not they change during learning (<a href=\"#fig5 fig6\">Figure 5 F and 6 A-C</a> in the revised manuscript)."

First, we showed that the elevated NC is not due to a few, high outliers skewing the reported mean. The box and whisker plot in <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 3A</a> depicts the same data as that plotted for the noise correlations curve for non-learners (cyan curve) in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4 A</a> of the revised manuscript. The box and whisker plot shows that the higher mean seen in the first trial bin is not due to outliers, but is in fact, a result of most of the correlation values for that bin being higher. The upper quartile, as well as the highest data value within 1.5 quartiles of the upper quartile, are far higher for the first bin than for subsequent bins. Second, we ruled out the trivial possibility that what we measure as noise-correlations using data acquired 4 seconds after puff stimulus delivery are in fact, correlations in long-sustained responses to the puff stimulus. We calculated peak response widths for each cell in the same manner as for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2 B</a> in the revised manuscript. To look for sustained activity after the puff stimulus during trials 1 to 5 for non-learners, we calculated response widths in the 4 s period immediately after the puff for trials 1 to 5. We found that no cell\u2019s response width was longer than 1 s. This rules out the possibility of sustained, puff stimulus responses 4 s later, during the segment of data used to calculate noise correlations."
