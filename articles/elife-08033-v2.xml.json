Because responses of retinal ganglion cells, the output cells of the retina, depend on signals from both rod and cone photoreceptors, interactions occurring in retinal circuits provide an opportunity to link the mechanistic operation of parallel pathways and perception. Here we show that rod- and cone-mediated responses interact nonlinearly to control the responses of primate retinal ganglion cells; these nonlinear interactions, surprisingly, were asymmetric, with rod responses strongly suppressing subsequent cone responses but not vice-versa. Human psychophysical experiments revealed a similar perceptual asymmetry. Nonlinear interactions in the retinal output cells were well-predicted by linear summation of kinetically-distinct rod- and cone-mediated signals followed by a synaptic nonlinearity. These experiments thus reveal how a simple mechanism controlling interactions between parallel pathways shapes circuit output and perception."

The site of this interaction is the connection\u2014or synapse\u2014between the very last cell in the cone pathway and the retinal output cells.

Comparing matches from trials in which the adapt flash was located in the same or the opposite eye as the test flashes allowed us to separate interactions that likely originated in the retina (monocular-specific interactions) from those that likely originated in the cortex (binocular interactions; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Monocular-specific interactions shared several features with those observed in the responses of ON parasol ganglion cells, although several issues, including uncertainty about how retinal and cortical interactions combine, precluded quantitative comparison: (1) rod \u2192 cone interactions were stronger than cone \u2192 rod interactions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>); and, (2) rod \u2192 cone interactions were stronger for 0.2\u20130.3 s intervals between adapt and test flashes than for 1 s intervals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>).

Rod-mediated signals can traverse the retina through the dedicated rod bipolar circuitry and/or through cones via rod-cone gap junctions and then through the associated cone bipolar circuitry (<a href=\"#bib8\">DeVries and Baylor, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1995</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To determine which route dominates under our experimental conditions, we compared RGC sensitivity to rod- and cone-preferring flashes with the sensitivity of L-cone synaptic terminals and horizontal cells. We adjusted the strengths of rod and cone flashes until they elicited similar amplitude responses in ON RGCs (with resulting flash strengths within a factor of two of those used for probing rod-cone interactions in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Then, in the same retinal slice, we measured voltage responses from either L-cone synaptic terminals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) or horizontal cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) to the same flashes; horizontal cells receive direct synaptic input from cones and hence provide a direct measure of cone synaptic output (<a href=\"#bib22\">Trumpler et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The ratios of the amplitudes of the rod-mediated to cone-mediated responses were \u223c8 times smaller in L-cone synaptic terminals and horizontal cells than in ON RGCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Thus, at these light levels rod-mediated signals appear to be routed through the dedicated rod bipolar circuitry until they reach the inner retina. Independent pharmacological manipulation of the rod and cone bipolar circuits provided further support for this conclusion (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This situation differs considerably from mouse retina, where rod signals are transmitted in parallel through rod and cone (via rod-cone gap junctions) bipolar circuits at these light levels (<a href=\"#bib13\">Grimes et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ke et al., 2014</a>)."

This did not appear to be the case: under conditions in which the RGC excitatory synaptic inputs exhibited strongly nonlinear responses, horizontal cells, AII amacrine cells, and cone bipolar cells all combined rod- and cone-mediated responses linearly\u2014that is, the linear sum of the responses delivered individually matched the response to the flashes delivered sequentially (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

One possibility is that transmission of the response to the adapt flash depletes the pool of presynaptic vesicles, resulting in a depressed response to the test flash. This mechanism, however, cannot easily account for the greater strength of rod \u2192 cone interactions compared to cone \u2192 rod interactions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>) since similar synaptic activation, regardless of origin, would be expected to produce similar levels of vesicle depletion. An alternative, but not exclusive, hypothesis is that kinetically-distinct rod- and cone-mediated signals sum linearly before passing through a common synaptic nonlinearity (i.e., the cone bipolar \u2192 ganglion cell synapse). Consistent with this hypothesis, the kinetics of the rod- and cone-mediated voltage responses of ON cone bipolar cells differed substantially (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; similar differences were observed in AII amacrine responses): rod-mediated responses were biphasic, consisting of an initial depolarization (rightward blue arrow in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) followed by a slow hyperpolarization (i.e., overshoot; leftward blue arrow in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>); the latter component depended on inhibition within the rod bipolar circuit (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Cone-mediated responses, in comparison, were faster and substantially less biphasic (red arrows in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In this case, even if rod- and cone-mediated responses sum prior to the nonlinearity, the hyperpolarization associated with the rod-mediated response could suppress the ability of a subsequent cone-mediated response to traverse the nonlinear synapse and produce a response in the ganglion cell. The smaller hyperpolarization of the cone-mediated response, however, would suppress a subsequent rod-mediated response less and hence result in a smaller nonlinear interaction."

First, we predicted responses to rod and cone flashes delivered independently. For example, for the rod flash response we scaled the amplitude of the rod linear filter so that its output, passed through the nonlinearity, matched the amplitude of the measured rod flash response. We followed the same procedure to scale the cone linear filter to match the measured cone flash response. We then predicted interactions between these flashes by offsetting the scaled linear filters in time to represent the time offset between flashes, linearly summing the two scaled filters, and passing the result through the common nonlinearity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

Both the predicted and measured interaction indices scaled with the degree of rectification in the nonlinearity as measured by the LN model (data not shown). The greater strength of rod \u2192 cone compared to cone \u2192 rod interactions in the LN model predictions depends directly on the rod linear filter being more biphasic than the cone filter; specifically, \u223c200 ms after the flash, the overshoot of the rod filter is maximally effective at suppressing the ability of the cone-mediated response to traverse the nonlinearity. Similarly, predicted interactions peaked for time offsets near 200 ms, as observed experimentally (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Thus a simple model based on linear summation of kinetically-distinct rod and cone responses followed by a rectifying nonlinearity can quantitatively predict the strength of interactions between rod- and cone-mediated flash responses, including the asymmetry in relative interaction strength."

Our work leads to two broad conclusions. First, perceptual measures of rod-cone interactions and their dependence on light level are often interpreted in the context of the different routes that rod-mediated signals could take through the retina (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib4\">Buck, 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2014</a>). Surprisingly, we found that the rod bipolar circuit remains the dominant route through which rod-mediated signals traverse the retina at light levels well above cone threshold. This lack of mixing of rod- and cone-mediated signals both constrains potential sites of interaction and provides ample opportunities for selective processing, for example to shape the kinetics of rod-mediated signals distinctly from cone-mediated signals. Second, perceptual rod-cone interactions can be complex\u2014for example, the asymmetric nonlinear interactions we investigate here. We show that these apparently complex interactions can be explained by a simple neural mechanism: linear summation of kinetically-distinct outputs from parallel circuits followed by a shared synaptic nonlinearity. This simple picture provides a key step towards understanding the mechanistic basis of the diverse rod-cone interactions that influence so many aspects of visual perception."

The linear filter (L) and nonlinearity (N) were estimated using measured excitatory synaptic inputs to On parasol ganglion cells in response to 50% contrast Gaussian noise (0\u201360 Hz bandwidth). Stimulus wavelength and intensity were chosen to emphasize rod- or cone-mediated responses (see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Model components were estimated using standard approaches (<a href=\"#bib19\">Rieke, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chichilnisky, 2001</a>; see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In brief, correlating the response with the stimulus estimated the linear filter (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Comparing the filter output (i.e., the stimulus convolved with the filter) with the measured response provided an estimate of the nonlinearity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Ganglion cell responses to flashes were then predicted by scaling the linear filter according to the flash strength and passing the scaled filter through the nonlinearity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

Psychophysical experiments in humans show that rod-cone interactions are asymmetric with rod responses suppressing subsequent cone responses much more strongly than vice versa. Similarly cone ON parasol ganglion cells show the asymmetry in retinal whole-mounts and slices. Careful analysis shows that the site of the asymmetry is best understood as linear summation at the ON cone bipolar cell synapse followed by the non-linearity in the synapse of the bipolar cell onto the ON parasol ganglion cell. The rod input here arises from the AII amacrine cell and is biphasic accounting for the suppressive interval after a rod flash. LNL modeling corroborates this analysis. The tie in between the biophysics and the slice physiology gives a special appeal to the results and the careful nature of the analysis gives confidence to the conclusions. The paper should be a wide interest in the visual community and also to other sensory physiologists because it serves as an example of how inputs from parallel processing pathways are combined for functional output."

Spike responses often exhibit periods of suppressed activity following the initial burst, regardless of flash origin. Rectification in the synaptic inputs, as well as low maintained firing rates (which often hit zero 200\u2013400 ms following a flash), minimize the overshoots in ganglion cell spike responses and can cause them to look similar for rod- and cone-mediated responses. In some cases (such as the gray trace in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) the suppression reflects a combination of a slow suppression following rod activation and a briefer suppression following cone activation."

These experiments suggest that feedback inhibition to the rod bipolar terminal accounts for the majority of the rapid component of the overshoot. Cone-mediated responses in AII amacrine cells look very similar to those in ON cone bipolar cells; in particular, such responses do not show a prominent overshoot. We have not measured responses to paired cone flashes in AIIs or ON cone bipolar cells. Relevant here though, linear filters describing the cone-mediated excitatory synaptic inputs to ganglion cells are substantially less biphasic than filters for rod-mediated inputs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). These filters are calculated during continuous inputs, so the lack of overshoot of the cone-mediated responses to brief flashes appears reasonably general and extends to stimuli involving prolonged cone activation"

We felt that those more mechanistically focused and more complicated experiments distracted from the focus of the present paper on the connection between retinal signaling and perception.

The key distinction we want to draw is that rod signals in mouse traverse the retina through both rod and cone bipolar circuits, while in primate the rod bipolar circuit appears to dominate. Thus, in mouse retina, both <a href=\"#bib14\">Ke et al., 2014</a> and <a href=\"#bib13\">Grimes et al., 2014</a> show that rod responses in AII amacrine cells are only partially blocked by NBQX at luminance levels above \u223c10R*/ rod/s. The responses remaining in the presence of NBQX are interpreted as coming through the rod-&gt;cone-&gt;cone bipolar pathway (similar to Trexler et al. 2005). This contrasts to our observations in primate where the rod-evoked flash response is eliminated by NBQX at a mean background of \u223c20R*/rod/s. The statement now reads: \u2018This situation differs considerably from mouse retina, where rod signals are simultaneously transmitted in parallel through rod and cone (via rod-cone gap junctions) bipolar circuits at these light levels (<a href=\"#bib13\">Grimes et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ke et al., 2014</a>)\u2019."
