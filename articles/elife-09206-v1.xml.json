In this report, we demonstrate that actomyosin contractility and planar cell polarity (PCP) interact in post-mitotic <i>Ciona</i> notochord cells to self-assemble and reposition actomyosin rings, which play an essential role for cell elongation. Intriguingly, rings always form at the cells\u2032 anterior edge before migrating towards the center as contractility increases, reflecting a novel dynamical property of the cortex. Our drug and genetic manipulations uncover a tug-of-war between contractility, which localizes cortical flows toward the equator and PCP, which tries to reposition them. We develop a simple model of the physical forces underlying this tug-of-war, which quantitatively reproduces our results. We thus propose a quantitative framework for dissecting the relative contribution of contractility and PCP to the self-assembly and repositioning of cytoskeletal structures, which should be applicable to other morphogenetic events."

In this report, we demonstrate that actomyosin contractility and planar cell polarity (PCP) interact in post-mitotic <i>Ciona</i> notochord cells to self-assemble and reposition actomyosin rings, which play an essential role for cell elongation. Intriguingly, rings always form at the cells\u2032 anterior edge before migrating towards the center as contractility increases, reflecting a novel dynamical property of the cortex. Our drug and genetic manipulations uncover a tug-of-war between contractility, which localizes cortical flows toward the equator and PCP, which tries to reposition them. We develop a simple model of the physical forces underlying this tug-of-war, which quantitatively reproduces our results. We thus propose a quantitative framework for dissecting the relative contribution of contractility and PCP to the self-assembly and repositioning of cytoskeletal structures, which should be applicable to other morphogenetic events."

These movements depend on a network of fibers made up of a protein called actin. Just like an animal's skeleton, this network provides an internal scaffold for the cell and supports the cell's movements. Another protein called myosin works closely with actin and acts as a motor that drives these movements."

These strange-looking creatures are distant relatives of humans and other animals with a spinal cord. All of these related creatures develop a long, rod-shaped structure called the notochord during the earliest stages of their development that is critical for forming the nervous system. Studying the development of the notochord is easier in sea squirts than other animals because the sea squirt's notochord is made up of just 40 cells arranged in a single file."

The experiments used microscopes and fluorescent markers to see what happens as the cells elongate to form the rod-like notochord, which stretches from the front to the back of the animal. This revealed that a ring made of actin and myosin forms near the front end of each cell and then migrates to the middle of the cell, stretching it along the way."

In these cells, the actin\u2013myosin ring remains stuck in the front of the cell. Treating the cells at a later stage, that is, when the rings had already arrived at the center, led to the central rings moving back to the front end of the cell. Furthermore, when a mutant sea squirt that had cells without a distinct front or back was treated with the myosin-blocking drug, the ring ended up at random places in the cells. Together, these results suggest that the placement of the actin\u2013myosin ring is determined by a tug-of-war between the pull of the front end of the cell and the myosin-driven force of the ring itself."

Correct positioning of the actin filaments is essential. In polarized migrating cells, actin flows posteriorly and becomes associated with myosin II at the trailing edge to propel the cell forward (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cramer, 2010</a>). In cytokinesis of vertebrate cells, the equatorial ring is established in many incidences by a cortical flow of actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bray and White, 1988</a>) driven by myosin contractility and is concentrated at the equator to ensure correct cell division (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao and Wang, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">DeBiasio et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mayer et al., 2010</a>). Despite the importance of the proper positioning of the actin cytoskeleton, our understanding of how cell polarity contributes to the organization of the cytoskeleton, and vice versa, is still incomplete. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> early embryogenesis, a flow of cortical myosin and F-actin towards the anterior pole carries PAR polarity proteins, which in turn modulate the actomyosin dynamics (<a href=\"#bib41\">Munro et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mayer et al., 2010</a>). Emerging evidence also point to a role for the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway in modulating cytoskeleton dynamics through its key mediators, Rho GTPases, which exert effects on actin polymerization and myosin contractility (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schlessinger et al., 2009</a>), although the mechanisms underlying this cross-talk remain obscure. On the other hand, in vitro experiments on reconstituted cytoskeletal structures (<a href=\"#bib57\">Surrey et al., 2001</a>), as well as recent mathematical models (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kruse et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hannezo et al., 2015</a>) suggest that actomyosin gels could have the properties to self-assemble, but the applicability of these findings to in vivo situations is not yet clear. Therefore, the interplay between self-assembly and polarity signals that organize the cytoskeleton remains largely unexplored."

Following C/E, the coin-shaped cells undergo continuous elongation along the anterior\u2013posterior axis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cloney, 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Miyamoto and Crowther, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jiang and Smith, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dong et al., 2009</a>), acquiring a drum shape (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Our previous studies show that an actomyosin contractile ring is present in the basal equator (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dong et al., 2011</a>) and produces a circumferential constriction. The force generated by the constriction is transmitted three dimensionally from the basal cortex towards anterior and posterior lateral domains through an incompressible cytoplasm, driving notochord cell elongation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dong et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sehring et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). The actomyosin ring is maintained by a bi-directional cortical flow and is under constant turnover in a manner remarkably similar to that of the cytokinetic ring during cell division. The position of contractile rings influences notochord cell shape and elongation. For example, in \u03b1-actinin mutants, the ring cannot maintain its position at the equator, and consequently, the cells fail to elongate but acquire an asymmetric shape (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sehring et al., 2014</a>). However, the mechanism of positioning the contractile ring in the equator of the notochord cells is unknown. This question is also of crucial relevance to our understanding of cytokinesis, where the position of the actomyosin ring is critical for the cells to divide properly (<a href=\"#bib52a\">Sedzinski et al., 2011</a>) and to direct the distribution of cell-fate determinants correctly (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clevers, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">G\u00f3mez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014</a>)."

During cell intercalation (16.5 hpf), when the cells start to align into a column, the low and evenly distributed actin in the basal cortex was replaced by patches of cortical actin accumulations close to the anterior pole (white arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). With the alignment of the cells into a column (17 hpf), these actin patches connected into an actin ring spanning the entire circumference of the basal domain next to the anterior pole of the coin-shaped cell (yellow arrowheads and intensity graph in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

High-speed time-lapse recordings revealed a migration of the cortical actin ring from the equator to the anterior pole (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,C\u2032</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), mirroring exactly the reverse sequence of migration of the ring towards the center in normal development. The front of the ring moved at a velocity of 91.8 \u00b1 10.5 nm/min (<i>n</i> = 10). The speed of the shift was blebbistatin dose dependent; halving the blebbistatin concentration reduced the velocity significantly to 27 \u00b1 0.5 nm/min (<i>n</i> = 10; p &lt; 0.0001). The ring width stayed constant when it shifted anteriorly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Remarkably, the encounter of the ring with the anterior lateral domain did not bring the movement to a halt. Instead, after the ring contacted the lateral domain (red line in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), the posterior edge of the ring continued to move anteriorly at an increasing speed of 191.6 \u00b1 21.4 nm/min (<i>n</i> = 10), so that the width of the ring narrowed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), until the entire ring disappeared at the position of the lateral domain (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The cell length did not significantly change during this process (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <i>n</i> = 10). We also examined the dynamic localization of talin, an actin-binding protein that bridges actin filaments and the adhesion apparatus at the cleavage furrow of dividing cells (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sanger et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Critchley, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</a>), and normally colocalized with the cortical actin ring at the equator in <i>Ciona</i> notochord (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sehring et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Live imaging showed that talin concentrated at the cell equator slightly after the ring had been established centrally (data not shown), suggesting that talin actually responds to cortical repositioning rather than driving it. Upon blebbistatin treatment of already established central rings (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), whereas the cortical actin was shifted to the anterior pole (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2032</a>), talin lagged behind at the equatorial position (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2032</a>). This result suggests not all components of the ring are shifted by blebbistatin."

                                "text": "The actin ring in elongating notochord cells is highly dynamic and consists of circumferential filaments that flow to the equator from both sides of the ring (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sehring et al., 2014</a>). The kymograph unveiled a persistence of this dynamics within the ring in blebbistatin-treated embryos: circumferentially oriented actin filament bundles (arrows in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; further examples are shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) from the anterior and posterior edges of the ring continued to flow towards the equator, which itself was shifting anteriorly (dashed line in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In the first 15 min of blebbistatin treatment, the filament bundles moved at a velocity of 7.62 \u00b1 0.78 nm/s (<i>n</i> = 18), which was significantly slower than the velocity in control cells (DMSO-treated cells) (29.92 nm/s, <i>n</i> = 10; p &lt; 0.001), where the filaments moved towards a stationary equator. Continued exposure to blebbistatin further reduced filament movement. Within the next 15 min, the velocity decreased significantly to 3.92 \u00b1 0.9 nm/s (<i>n</i> = 22; p = 0.004). The deceleration of the filament bundles resulted in a flattening of their trajectories in the kymograph. Measurement of the angles of filament bundles revealed a reduction from 39\u00b0 to 3\u00b0 within 30 min of blebbistatin treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2032,F</a>). After 31.1 \u00b1 1.36 min (<i>n</i> = 20), directed movement of filament bundles towards the center of the ring (the moving equator) ceased, and only filament bundles moving nearly parallel to the direction of the shifting ring could be observed (yellow arrowheads, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). After the ring had reached the anterior lateral domain, no pronounced filaments were detectable. There is no statistical difference in either velocities or angles between anterior- and posterior-directed filament bundles at any time. To analyze if there was still actin turnover within the ring at a time point when no prominent filament bundles were visible in a kymograph, or if it was a static ring shifting anteriorly, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments on notochord cells expressing mCherry-hActin. We bleached the entire equatorial ring in cells of control embryos, or the entire shifting ring in cells of embryos treated with blebbistatin for at least 30 min. For control embryos, the recovery curve was well fitted by a single exponential (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), yielding a characteristic turnover rate of 90 s \u00b1 3 s. In the shifting ring with blebbistatin treatment, fluorescence also recovered, indicating a persistent cortical flow of actin elements from outside the ring towards its center. Interestingly, the dynamics could no longer be fitted by a single exponential, as it contained two characteristic recovery times: a fast one, very similar to the control, and a much slower one of 7.8 \u00b1 0.6 min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). A rough estimate of the flow-induced duration to close a bleached segment of 3 \u00b5m, assuming a mean velocity of 30 nm/s, is 100 s, which cannot be distinguished from the turnover time. However, after blebbistatin treatment, the mean velocity drops to roughly 6 nm/s (see Figure 6E), leading to a duration of 8 min, which is very similar to the measured slower recovery time. This further indicates a requirement of myosin motor activity for a strong cortical flow of actin elements, while local polymerization and depolymerization is still present and represents 30% of the recovery and appears to be very slightly affected by the blebbistatin treatment. These observations together reveal a persistence of fast inner-ring dynamics, albeit a bit slower because of decreased actin velocity, superimposed on a slow global shifting of the ring towards the anterior edge upon blebbistatin treatment."

A kymograph generated from the time-lapse reveals that the two rings overlapped in time only transiently: at the time point the first ring disappeared, the second ring emerged (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). The position, shape, and size of the second rings were often less precise and less sharp than the first rings (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,J</a>).

                                "text": "As notochord cells are planarly polarized, and ring migration is always unidirectional in wild-type embryo, this prompted us to examine the effect of A/P polarity on actin ring migration. A conspicuous feature of the A/P polarity is the posterior localization of the nucleus, which is regulated by <i>prickle</i>, a core PCP component. The <i>Ciona savignyi</i> mutant <i>aimless</i> carries a deletion in <i>prickle</i>, resulting in a loss of A/P polarity manifested in the randomized localization of nucleus in addition to an earlier convergent extension defect (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>). We first explored the possibility that the posterior nucleus might influence the direction of ring movement mobilized by blebbistatin. To this end, we examined the notochord of the ascidian <i>Halocynthia roretzi</i>, which follows a remarkably similar early developmental process as in <i>Ciona</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), except at the cell elongation stage, the nuclei are positioned in the center of the cells (asterisks in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). A conspicuous circumferential constriction is present at the equator, which is colocalized with a cortical ring of actin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and activated myosin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), whose activity is essential for notochord cell elongation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). We next treated embryos with elongating notochord cells with blebbistatin for 3 hr. Similar to what was observed in <i>Ciona</i>, the actin ring was shifted invariably anteriorly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), indicating that the position of the nucleus does not influence the dynamic behavior of the ring. We thus used <i>aimless</i> embryos to explore the role of a compromised A/P polarity on the repositioning of the ring and its shifting upon blebbistatin treatment, independent from its influence on nuclear position. In wild-type <i>C. savignyi</i> embryos, elongated notochord cells possess a circumferential actin ring at the cell equator and a posterior nucleus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Blebbistatin treatment shifts the ring towards the anterior pole (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), mirroring exactly the events in <i>C. intestinalis</i>. In <i>aimless</i> embryos, the intercalation of notochord cells (outlined in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) is impaired, except in the posterior region where the cells often align into a single file (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>). In these cells, the loss of A/P polarity is evident by the random position of the nuclei (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> insert). In 92% of mock-treated <i>aimless</i> cells in this region, the actin ring is positioned at the equator (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> insert), showing that equatorial ring positioning is independent from PCP. However, reducing contractility in polarity-deficient mutant cells led to a dramatically different phenotype: after 60-min blebbistatin treatment, no unidirectional migration towards the anterior was observed. The direction of the shift was randomized and independent of the localization of the nucleus: examples for anterior nucleus and ring, anterior nucleus and posterior ring, posterior nucleus and ring, and posterior nucleus and anterior ring could be found (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,D'</a>). In 56% of the cells, the ring was still positioned at the equator, and in the rest, the ring migrated either to the anterior or posterior side (18% and 26%) (<i>n</i> = 57) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). These results imply that A/P polarity by <i>prickle</i> is not necessary for the establishment of an equatorial actin ring; however, it is instrumental for the direction of movement of the ring upon blebbistatin treatment."

Such models generically predict spontaneous accumulations of actomyosin. Indeed, if the actomyosin concentration is slightly higher in a given region, then the contractile stress is also locally higher compared to the surroundings. Because of this initially small imbalance, surrounding actomyosin fibers flow towards the accumulation, making it even denser and even more contractile (<a href=\"#bib46\">Recho et al., 2013</a>). This self-reinforcing loop, which concentrates actomyosin in a single spot at the cortex with filaments flowing towards the ring, is resisted by their depolymerization and effective diffusion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), which favor a homogenous cortex."

To begin, in order to expose the role of contractility only, we first assumed that they vanish. It should be noted that the actomyosin flux <i>J</i> encompasses both actin filament velocity, and an effective diffusive flux arising from actin polymerization (see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>: the model). Therefore, a vanishing total flux does not necessarily entail a vanishing velocity.

We can then interpret that the driving force positioning the ring at the equator is the contractility increase during the process of ring migration. Before finalizing the model, we check two of its key assumptions that (1) contractility increases smoothly as ring migration proceeds, and (2) the velocity gradient of actin filaments towards the center should depend linearly on the local contractility, indicated by local actomyosin concentration (as seen in <a href=\"#equ3\">Equation 3</a>). To address the first assumption, we measure the angle between the lateral and basal side, from embryos at various stages (n &gt; 20 angles for each embryo) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). As shown recently (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ma\u00eetre et al., 2012</a>), this angle <math id=\"inf89\"><mrow><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>arccos</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover></mrow><mi>\u03b3</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> reflects a force balance between the tensions of the basal (<math id=\"inf90\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover></mrow></math>) and lateral (<math id=\"inf91\"><mi>\u03b3</mi></math>) surfaces, and therefore can be used as a proxy for tension changes. Interestingly, the angle decreased smoothly and continuously during elongation and ring migration, indicative of an increased basal tension relative to lateral tension (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), by roughly a factor of 2.5 during the elongation process, and 1.5 during the ring migration process. We assume at first order approximation that lateral tension is constant and set in the model that (<math id=\"inf92\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover></mrow></math>) increases by a factor 1.5. As we shall show later, such an increase enables a good fit to all of the available data (see <a href=\"#app4\">Appendix 4</a>: rough estimates of model parameters, and <a href=\"#app5\">Appendix 5</a>: model predictions for further details). To test the second assumption, we performed PIV analysis on high frequency movies of actin flows (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), to measure local velocity gradients. When plotting these as a function of local actin concentration, we found a robust negative linear correlation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), which shows that flows are driven by differences in actomyosin concentration, validating quantitatively <a href=\"#equ3\">Equation 3</a> of our model. From the slope of the correlation, as well as from the characteristic of actin bundles measured above in the kymographs, we could extract the ratio (\u03c7/\u03b7) of contractility and viscosity. Finally, we fixed the last parameters of our model through FRAP experiments (\u03c4 = 90 s) and through the width of the ring intensity profile (D = 2.10<sup>\u221212</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s) (see <a href=\"#app4\">Appendix 4</a>: rough estimates of model parameters for the details of parameter fitting). Under these assumptions and with these parameters, a central ring spontaneously forms at the center of the cell when contractility increases above the critical threshold <math id=\"inf93\"><mrow><msub><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03c7</mi><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mi>c</mi></msub></mrow></math>, and contractility is self-sufficient to maintain the ring structure through actomyosin flows. However, the experimental data show the existence of a stage where the ring is positioned at the anterior side and also underlines the importance of PCP in the repositioning of actin rings. Our final model therefore incorporates polarity in the model in the simplest way possible: by assuming that it creates a small preferential polymerization of actin at the anterior side, that is, there is a non-zero flux at the anterior side, different from the flux at the posterior side. We considered that the flux on the posterior side was still zero, that is, <math id=\"inf94\"><mrow><mi>J</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mo>\u2212</mo><mi>L</mi><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>F</mi></mrow></math> and <math id=\"inf95\"><mrow><mi>J</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>. We showed in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> in <a href=\"#app5\">Appendix 5</a>: model prediction that lifting this constraint does not qualitatively change our results, as the key parameter is the difference between anterior and posterior flux, but not their respective magnitude and our system is locally robust with respect to this type of perturbation. Assuming the existence of a preferential polymerization at one boundary due to PCP was supported by the well-studied link between PCP and actin polymerization (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</a>). In particular, Disheveled (Dsh), one of the core member of the PCP pathway has been shown to activate key actin regulators such as Rho and Rac (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tahinci and Symes, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</a>), as well as Daam1, a member of the formin protein family (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kida et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gao and Chen, 2010</a>). It should be noted that as we are treating the actomyosin gel as a single species (with the assumption that bipolar filaments performing the contractile power stroke co-localize with actin), assuming that PCP localizes myosin anteriorly, as reported in <a href=\"#bib42\">Newman-Smith et al., 2015</a>, would yield the same qualitative results. With these final boundary conditions, the dynamical system <a href=\"#equ1 equ2 equ3\">Equations (1\u20133)</a> predicts a transition (which is now smooth, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> in <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>: the model) between two mechanically stable states of the actin ring: a central position if the contractility \u03c7 is large enough, and an anterior position when \u03c7 is small enough and the polarity-induced actin flux F dominates. We set the value of F using the filament velocity order of magnitude as well as the experimental actin density profiles when the contractility is impaired (blebbistatin experiments, see <a href=\"#app5\">Appendix 5</a>: model predictions)."

Interestingly, we predicted, and observed in the PIV, a rather large, non-zero value for the actin filament velocity at the posterior edge of the cell, which is compensated in the model by actin polymerization on the side, since the total flux is zero. Moreover, we note a remaining, albeit small bias in ring position towards the anterior side, as in the data, showing that an anterior-imbalance remains at the later stages, both in simulations and in the data."

After 110 min, we then simulated a blebbistatin treatment as an exponential decrease in contractility, following previous experimental results on traction force decrease with blebbistatin (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lam et al., 2012</a>; details in <a href=\"#app5\">Appendix 5</a>: model predictions), which predicted a rapid migration back towards the anterior pole. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> displays a kymograph of the numerical integration. Next, we compared model predictions and experimental data (average over 7 cells for normal ring migration, and 5 cells for blebbistatin treatment). It should be noted that in our model, the migration speed of the ring is controlled by the dynamics of contractility changes. This is in agreement with our experimental observation that the velocity is dependent on the dose of blebbistatin used, but also with the fact that the velocity of the ring migration is an order of magnitude smaller than the velocity of the actin filament bundles."

Indeed, in control cells, a rough estimate of the time needed to close a bleached segment of 3 \u00b5m through flows, given a mean velocity of 30 nm/s, is 100 s, which cannot be distinguished from the turnover time. Therefore, we only see a single-exponential recovery. However, after blebbistatin treatment the mean velocity drops to roughly 6 nm/s (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), leading to a time of 8 min for flow-induced recovery, which is strikingly similar to the time extracted from the FRAP analysis of 7.8 min. There are then two time scales for recovery, one linked to turnover, unaffected by blebbistatin, and one linked to flows, which is dramatically compromised by blebbistatin."

This is because ring formation is a spontaneous, self-organizing phenomenon that depends on boundary conditions, and therefore on the size of the cell. We measured experimentally actin ring width during cell elongation, and found it indeed increases linearly with the length of the cell, in very good quantitative agreement with our model, with all parameters having already been fixed above. In cytokinesis, it was proposed that such a scaling could allow cytokinetic time to be independent of cell size as observed in <i>C. elegans</i> embryos (<a href=\"#bib59\">Turlier et al., 2014</a>).

Having fixed the one parameter for the blebbistatin treatment, we sought to test our model further via second independent measurement. We plotted the predicted decay of actin velocity from our simulations and compared it to the experimental data measured above. Again, we found an excellent quantitative agreement between predictions and data (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

Yet, emerging evidence suggests that the <i>Ciona</i> notochord possesses an intriguing array of complexity, including differential gene expression, asymmetrical cell lineages, desynchronized morphogenetic behavior (<a href=\"#bib48\">Reeves et al., 2014</a>), and an A/P polarity which manifests in the posterior localization of nuclei in the first 39 cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>). The current study reveals hitherto unknown aspects of A/P polarity in dynamical properties of actomyosin cortex. An actin ring forms at the anterior side of cells as core PCP proteins such as Disheveled relocate there, and then migrates to the equator as contractility increases, where it contributes to cell elongation. Interestingly, planar polarized contractile flows were reported during <i>Drosophila</i> germ-band extension (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rauzi et al., 2010</a>). The ring movements that we observe are very robust, with surprisingly little fluctuation, given the highly dynamic nature of the ring. Here, we could disentangle the contributions of contractility and PCP to this robust positioning, by a combination of drug and genetic experiments. We show that decreasing contractility via blebbistatin reverses the normal developmental sequence, causing an anterior shift of the equatorial ring (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), which can be observed consistently throughout the elongation stage, but not in polarity mutants. This suggests a tug-of-war between contractility and cellular polarity: sufficiently large myosin contractility antagonizes the <i>Prickle/Dishevelled</i>-mediated anterior bias and can self-organize the actin ring in the center of the cell purely by physical forces, as shown by our theoretical analysis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Indeed, the equatorial ring in the notochord cells, despite its resemblance to the equatorial ring in cytokinesis, is established in a spindle-independent manner. A similar phenomenon has been reported in the asymmetrical cell division of <i>Drosophila</i> neuroblasts (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cabernard et al., 2010</a>), which also uses cortical polarity signals to regulate the furrow."

This suggests the existence of additional signals for ring formation and from a theoretical perspective, underlines the need to go beyond our simple one-component model, for instance, in order to take into account the dynamics of adhesion complexes as well. Indeed, our model is the simplest one can write for active gels, and it assumes for instance that all the rheological coefficients are constant, while in principle some, for example, viscosity, could depend on the state of the gel, and on blebbistatin concentration in the drug treatment (<a href=\"#bib56\">Stirbat et al., 2013</a>). Nevertheless, the fact that we can capture well the experimental data with such a simple model suggests that such coupling effects are probably of secondary importance for the observed phenomenon. It should be noted that, in this study, we have considered polarity as a constant, externally fixed parameter and examined its effect on actomyosin localization. In fact, a recent study in the same system (<a href=\"#bib42\">Newman-Smith et al., 2015</a>) suggested an active feedback of myosin in core PCP protein localization. The next logical step would therefore be to incorporate this feedback loop to our formalism."

In brief, the authors show that an equatorial ring of actin filaments and myosin-2, previously found to be responsible for powering elongation, assembles as a result of myosin-2 powered contraction and resultant cortical flow of F-actin. Initially, F-actin is concentrated in a ring at the anterior end of the cells, but it moves parallel to the plane of the cortex to the middle of the cell, where it is needed to do its job. Myosin-2 shows a similar behavior and disruption of its motor activity with blebbistatin (which blocks elongation) prevents repositioning of the actin ring. Moreover, blebbistatin causes repositioning (to the anterior) of the ring when applied after the achievement of its central location. The authors develop a simple model, which successfully captures some of the key features observed, but does one essential feature \u2013 the starting localization at the anterior of the cell. This prompted a series of experiments designed to test the possibility that the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is responsible for the starting localization. They found that it is, providing a link between a pathway implicated in several different morphogenetic events (PCP) and a cellular process that actually powers a morphogenetic event. The authors modified their model which was thereupon able to capture all of the relevant results."

Therefore, probably the correct term that should be used here is 'cortical tension' along the basal and lateral domains, which is different from 'contractility'. 'Contractility' arises from active tension generated by actomyosin and 'cortical tension' is the total mechanical tension within the cortex. The authors should clearly state what they measured and how they used the obtained values for the model fitting.

In addition, blebbistatin treatment interferes with contractility in the whole organism and will change various parameters also in surrounding tissues.

Therefore, even if we assume that the total flux F vanishes at the posterior boundary, there can still be a flow \\rho v of actomyosin, which is counterbalanced by preferential polymerization at the boundary (which is the case in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> in the main text). We chose the assumption of total flux to vanish because it is the simplest one as a first approximation, and one does not need a non-zero total flux to explain the data. Though we consider the case where the total anterior flux vanishes to explain why contractility drives the formation of a central ring, our final model accounts for a non-zero anterior flux representing the cell polarization.

Based on these observations, we believe the ring behaves quite autonomously within the notochord cells.

Therefore, our assumption that actin is brought preferentially at the anterior side resulting in an effective increased contractility there (because of increased density), which would be very similar qualitatively to considering preferential myosin activity. We made the connection more explicit in our revision and discussed <a href=\"#bib42\">Newman-Smith et al. (2015)</a> in the Results section and in the Discussion."
