This process markedly stimulates cell migration and is constitutively activated in more than 60% of breast carcinomas. How this activation is achieved remains unclear. Here, we screened 948 signalling genes using RNAi and imaging. We identified 12 negative regulators of O-glycosylation that all control GalNAc-T sub-cellular localisation. ERK8, an atypical MAPK with high basal kinase activity, is a strong hit and is partially localised at the Golgi. Its inhibition induces the relocation of GalNAc-Ts, but not of KDEL receptors, revealing the existence of two separate COPI-dependent pathways. ERK8 down-regulation, in turn, activates cell motility. In human breast and lung carcinomas, ERK8 expression is reduced while ER O-glycosylation initiation is hyperactivated. In sum, ERK8 appears as a constitutive brake on GalNAc-T relocalisation, and the loss of its expression could drive cancer aggressivity through increased cell motility."

This process markedly stimulates cell migration and is constitutively activated in more than 60% of breast carcinomas. How this activation is achieved remains unclear. Here, we screened 948 signalling genes using RNAi and imaging. We identified 12 negative regulators of O-glycosylation that all control GalNAc-T sub-cellular localisation. ERK8, an atypical MAPK with high basal kinase activity, is a strong hit and is partially localised at the Golgi. Its inhibition induces the relocation of GalNAc-Ts, but not of KDEL receptors, revealing the existence of two separate COPI-dependent pathways. ERK8 down-regulation, in turn, activates cell motility. In human breast and lung carcinomas, ERK8 expression is reduced while ER O-glycosylation initiation is hyperactivated. In sum, ERK8 appears as a constitutive brake on GalNAc-T relocalisation, and the loss of its expression could drive cancer aggressivity through increased cell motility."

For several decades, researchers have been aware that cancer cells have more proteins coated with modified sugars on their cell surfaces than healthy cells. This is caused by the enzymes that add these sugars to the proteins relocating from one location within the cell, the Golgi apparatus, to another, called the endoplasmic reticulum. These specific \u2018sugar-coated\u2019 proteins are known to encourage cancer cells to migrate and invade new tissues, but the mechanisms that regulate the addition of these sugar molecules to proteins remains poorly understood."

ERK8 is shown to prevent the relocation of the sugar-adding enzymes from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby restricting the production of sugar-coated proteins that help the cancer cells to spread within the body. By identifying 12 potential targets for new therapeutics aimed at preventing the spread of cancer, the work of Chia et al. could ultimately help to improve the chances of patients recovering from certain cancers."

The addition of GalNAc on proteins generates the Tn antigen, with antigenicity being lost upon the addition of other sugar residues.

Unlike classical MAP kinases, ERK8 possesses an atypically long C-terminal domain and appears to constitutively auto-phosphorylate its Thr-X-Tyr motif (<a href=\"#bib31\">Klevernic et al., 2006</a>). Here, we find that a fraction of the ERK8 protein is localised at the Golgi where it specifically inhibits COPI vesicle formation and the export of GalNAc-Ts. The loss of ERK8 activity results in increased O-glycosylation and increased cell motility. We find that ERK8 expression is also frequently downregulated in lung carcinomas, which may partly explain the high Tn phenotype and invasiveness of these tumours."

In the analysis presented in this study, we quantified Tn levels using HPL fluorescence intensity per cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In a pilot screen using HeLa cells, which targeted 63 known players of membrane traffic (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chia et al., 2012</a>), we identified that knockdown of the SNARE gene Syntaxin 5 (<i>STX5</i>) reproducibly induced a 6\u20137-fold increase in Tn levels relative to a non-targeting (NT) control (GFP siRNA) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This effect was presumably due to a defect in the balance in anterograde vs retrograde ER-to-Golgi traffic of GalNAc-Ts. Using <i>STX5</i> and GFP siRNA as positive and negative controls, we then screened 948 signalling genes in search for regulators of O-glycosylation. We discarded the results for 134 siRNA pools that reduced the cell number to less than 20% of the control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Of the remaining siRNA pools, we identified numerous gene knockdowns that increased HPL levels significantly more than <i>STX5</i> depletion. None of the gene depletions seemed to significantly reduce the basal levels of Tn in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The knockdown effects were reproduced in independent replicates (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>), and the trend was mostly independent of the analysis algorithm used, although the fold increase was higher with one method than with the other (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Although GalNAc-Ts have not been known to be regulated by Vps74/GOLPH3, it represents a potential mechanism for their retention at the Golgi. PKMYT1 is required for the reassembly of the Golgi during telophase (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nakajima et al., 2008</a>).

Indeed, co-treatment of cells with Ro-31-8220 and a transcriptional inhibitor \u03b1-amanitin (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chafin et al., 1995</a>) did not reduce Tn levels (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) and protein levels of the enzymes and chaperones involved in the early O-glycosylation stages were unaffected in ERK8-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

Consistently, staining for GalNAc-Ts showed a similar trend, with a significant increase in enzyme localisation at the Golgi within 2 hr of washout (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>). This suggests that reactivation of ERK8 slows the continuous retrograde flow of GalNAc-Ts and that anterograde traffic shifts their distribution back to the Golgi. These results show that GalNAc-T relocalisation is rapidly reversible and suggests that ERK8 provides a continual brake for GalNAc-T relocation at the Golgi."

To address this, we first analysed the subcellular localisation of ERK8 protein by immunofluorescence and observed a predominantly cytosolic pattern in wild-type HeLa cells.

This obviously does not preclude the main elongation enzyme, C1GALT or its specific chaperone, COSMC (alias <i>C1GALT1C1</i>) from being regulated in some conditions, but a significant inhibition of the activity of these proteins was not observed in our screen conditions. In contrast, the subcellular localisation of GalNAc-Ts appears to be a nodal point of control in a complex signalling network. Indeed, at least 12 independent negative regulators were identified and at least as many positive regulators, including the SRC family tyrosine kinases, are likely to be involved. This regulatory complexity suggests that perhaps signals of different origins are being integrated at the level of GalNAc-Ts traffic."

Consistently, two of these proteins, PKMYT1 and MAP4K2, are also reported to localize at the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ren et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 1997</a>), and several other regulators interact with Golgi-localised proteins.

The precise identity of these substrates, as well as the functional effects of their glycosylation, remains to be established. Notwithstanding, the outcome of the relocation at the cellular level is clearly a significant stimulator of cell migration. Indeed, the stimulatory effect of ERK8 depletion is dependent on ER-localised O-glycosylation. These results are also consistent with our previous data based on the expression of an exogenous, ER-targeted form of GalNAc-T2 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gill et al., 2013</a>).

Thus, how GalNAc-T relocation is stimulated in cancer cells has probably important medical implications. Our analyses suggest that multiple mechanisms are possible, including a decrease in ERK8 protein levels. However, the actual level of decrease required to stimulate relocation is not known and is anyway probably dependent on other cellular parameters. Additionally, Tn levels are not likely to depend only on the intracellular distribution of GalNAc-Ts. For instance, normal tissues with high levels of mucin expression, such as stomach, colon or kidney, tend to have higher endogenous Tn levels without clear evidence for relocation. This complexity probably contributes to the lack of direct correlation between ERK8 and Tn levels."

Human ARF1 (NM-001024228)-GFP expression clones were described previously (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gill et al., 2010</a>). miR-ERK8 and miR-GFP vector were generated from BLOCK- iT Pol II miR RNAi expression vector kits from Invitrogen. All constructs were verified by sequencing and restriction enzyme digests before use."

Image analysis was performed using MetaXpress software (version 3.1.0.89). For each well, total HPL staining intensity and nuclei number was quantified using Transfluor HT application module in the software. Briefly, masking for both Cy5 (HPL) and DAPI (Nuclei) channels was generated by setting the mask dimensions and cut-off intensity above the background for each of the two channels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and intensities were quantified in the area covered by the masking. Hundreds of cells were quantified and the averages per well were calculated. To compare HPL intensities between wells, HPL intensity per cell of each well was obtained by normalising the total HPL intensity (\u2018Integrated Granule Intensity\u2019 of Cy5 channel) with nuclei number of the well. The same procedures were performed for the quantification of PNA and GalNAc-T1 staining in the secondary screens. Statistical significance was measured using a paired t test assuming a two-tailed Gaussian distribution."

This process leads to stimulation of cell adhesion and migration. The current study extends this work by using a RNAi screen of 948 genes involved in signal transduction to identify 12 genes that serve as negative regulators of this process, with ERK8 being the most potent and the focus of the rest of the paper. Data are presented that ERK8 is partially localized to the Golgi and must be catalytically active to retain the GalNAcTs in the Golgi. Some data are presented that ERK8 expression is downregulated in breast and lung cancers, which are associated with increased 0-GalNAc formation in the ER. Additionally it is shown that ERK8 regulated retrograde traffic of GalNAcTs is dependent on COPI."

For example, do methods reported by Luini to enhance KDEL-R retrograde transport also activate GalNAcT1 trafficking? Are the two routes similar in sensitivity to specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors? Can they monitor the actual rate of KDEL receptor recycling rather than steady state localization or overexpress a KDEL substrate to alter the KDELR trafficking and verify that it is insensitive or less sensitive to Erk8 depletion.

Together with our previous quantification, these data indicate that whereas Src controls trafficking of both KDEL-R and GalNac-Ts, ERK8 only controls GalNac-Ts traffic. Both the receptor for KDEL and the enzymes use the COPI coat machinery but their traffic is activated through different pathways: rate of secretion for KDEL-R; growth factors and events involved in cancerous transformation for GalNac-Ts."
