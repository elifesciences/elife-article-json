This categorization process allows us to interact with such environments. Eager to get to an important meeting, we drive fast, but the actual speed depends on the speed limits along the way. In this situation, categories are delineated by a category boundary (i.e., speed limit) that varies with different environments. Flexible categorization requires continuous monitoring of the changes in the environment to ensure that classification reflects current task demands, even after categories are well learned. How the brain monitors such complex cognitive behavior is not well understood. The basal ganglia, particularly the caudate nucleus, are known to be essential for flexible behavior (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wise et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barnes et al., 2005</a>) and together with the interconnected prefrontal and parietal cortices play an important role in categorization (<a href=\"#bib40\">Poldrack et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Poldrack et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Seger and Cincotta, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Freedman and Assad, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Seger, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Antzoulatos and Miller, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ashby and Maddox, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mendez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Merchant et al., 2011</a>). Many psychiatric and neurological disorders that compromise the caudate nucleus are characterized by impairment in cognitive flexibility (<a href=\"#bib29\">Knowlton et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shohamy et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Montoya et al., 2006</a>). Human and animal studies have provided extensive evidence for the critical role of this structure in category learning (<a href=\"#bib45\">Seger and Miller, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Antzoulatos and Miller, 2011</a>). Neurobiological models of categorization have suggested that the caudate nucleus, together with interconnected cortical and subcortical structures, contributes to the maintenance and switching of rules that guide categorization (<a href=\"#bib31\">Maddox and Ashby, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ashby and Ennis, 2006</a>)."

Recent studies have highlighted the strong contribution of the caudate to post-action evaluation by monitoring behavioral performance based on reward information (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lau and Glimcher, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ding and Gold, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Thorn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). The general idea is that the caudate detects a mismatch between expected and actual outcomes and these prediction error signals tend to alert an organism about the overall level of behavioral performance. Some studies have shown that post-action neuronal activity maintained memory traces of specific actions, possibly linking them to outcomes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lau and Glimcher, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). Others have found that post-action activity represented outcomes independent of specific actions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ding and Gold, 2010</a>). Monitoring signals are sensitive to behavioral context change (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hikosaka and Isoda, 2010</a>) and can also incorporate uncertainty estimates (<a href=\"#bib4\">Badre, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kepecs and Mainen, 2012</a>) known to modulate caudate activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ding and Gold, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yanike and Ferrera, 2014</a>). Thus, a systematic evaluation of caudate monitoring signals is important for understanding its role in behavioral flexibility, when changes in context and outcome are frequent."

On each trial, one of the boundary speeds (5 or 13 deg/s), selected randomly, was indicated by a visual cue at the beginning of the trial, prior to the motion stimulus. Therefore, depending on the visual cue, a particular speed of dot movement would switch from belonging to the fast or slow category. Two choice targets (red/green), the locations of which were randomized from trial to trial, were presented adjacent to the motion stimulus. Monkeys made saccades to the red target if they categorized the stimulus as \u2018slow\u2019 and to the green target if they categorized the stimulus as \u2018fast\u2019."

We sorted behavioral data across animals and trials by the boundary position. We obtained two shifted psychometric functions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), suggesting that animals classified the stimuli using two different internal estimates of the boundary position. To estimate the internal representation of each boundary we found the stimulus speed for which the animal was equally likely to classify the stimulus as \u2018fast\u2019 or \u2018slow\u2019 (i.e., the point of subjective equality (PSE), <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The per-session PSE's formed two non-overlapping distributions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) with means (slow: 6.9 \u00b1 0.1; fast: 11.3 \u00b1 0.12) shifted inward relative to the actual boundary speeds (5 and 13, respectively; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This implies that the monkeys' categorical decisions were less accurate for stimulus speeds near the boundaries, possibly due to uncertainty about the boundary position or its internal estimate. Consistently, the greater categorization uncertainty at the boundaries, expressed as an error rate, correlated with a higher rate of trials that the animal aborted without making a choice (broke fixation) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Both the error rate and the rate of fixation breaks peaked for speeds 6 and 12, suggesting that subjects had greater difficulty categorizing these near boundary stimuli."

For each neuron only trials in the neuron's response field were included. The data from the two monkeys were combined as they were qualitatively similar. We found that the majority of caudate neurons were responsive after, and not prior to, the animal making a decision. Therefore we focused on two post-decision periods of the task, one right after the decision (\u2018post-saccade\u2019, 0\u2013400 ms after saccade onset, median saccade onset 309 ms) and another when the correctness of the decision was revealed at 800 ms after the decision onset (\u2018reward\u2019, 0\u2013600 ms after reward onset). We found that many neurons (71 out of 155, 46%, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, top) showed significantly different activity between the fixation period and at least one of the post-decision periods of the task (bootstrap test, p &lt; 0.01). Next, we asked whether caudate neurons represented category-related information regardless of the properties of the visual stimuli or their stimulus selectivity. We identified 38 out of 71 neurons that were sensitive to the category context (i.e., boundary position) during either one or both post-decision periods (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, bottom). The firing rates of these neurons were significantly different between the two boundary positions for at least one speed either during the post-saccade (\u2018psacc\u2019, n = 31) and/or reward (\u2018rwd\u2019, n = 23) periods of the task (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, boostrap test, p &lt; 0.05 Bonferroni corrected). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> shows example neurons with activity during the post-saccade (A) and reward (B) periods with a significantly different average response to one out of 8 stimuli, corresponding to speed 12 (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for other examples), for which they responded with either significantly higher (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) or lower (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) firing rate on trials with the fast compared to slow boundary positions (bootstrap test, p &lt; 0.0001). These neurons responded similarly to most other stimuli, irrespective of the boundary position (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, bottom). The majority of these post-decision neurons (psacc: 19/31, 61%; rwd: 15/23, 65%) discriminated significantly only one out of 8 stimuli and many of them (psacc: 22/31, 71%; rwd: 11/23, 48%) had significantly different neuronal activity for stimuli near the category boundaries, speeds 6 and 12 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>, bottom)."

The index ranges between 0 and 1, with values close to 0 indicating weak discrimination and values close to 1 indicating strong differentiation between the two categories. Similarly to the example neurons, the CIs between the stimuli close to the boundaries (speeds 6 and 12) were different for most individual neurons in both periods of the task (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). When averaged across neurons, the CIs for the two most difficult stimuli were the highest during both periods of the task (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>, top). The ability of individual neurons to multiplex their function according to the relevant boundary position is inconsistent with the known sensitivity of caudate neurons to the rate of reward coding, which varied similarly with two boundaries (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cromwell and Schultz, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hassani et al., 2001</a>).

We predicted on each trial the stimulus speed and category boundary position (for a total of 16 conditions: 8 \u00d7 2) based on the neuronal activity of populations of independently recorded neurons (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). To evaluate the prediction accuracy, we used the proportion of correct estimates for either speed or boundary position. We found that on each trial, the population activity of ensembles of caudate neurons provided a reliable read-out of the two signals: the identity (speed) of the previously categorized stimulus and the context (boundary position) in which the stimulus was categorized with above chance accuracy during the post-saccade (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, B; n = 31) and reward (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>; n = 23) periods of the task. To account for variable levels of the subjects' performance, we obtained the prediction accuracy for the speed and boundary position separately for correct only trials and for all trials (correct and incorrect) separately. On average, the prediction accuracies for the two signals were significantly better on correct trials compared to all trials for the post-saccade (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>; 1-way ANOVA (trial type), p &lt; 0.0001) and reward (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>; p &lt; 0.0001) populations.

The decoding performance converged towards an asymptote faster for the boundary position (\u223c5 neurons) compared to the speed (\u223c10\u201315 neurons) in each neuronal population.

The actual boundary positions (speeds 5/13 for slow/fast boundaries respectively) were never explicitly given and the subjects had to infer the positions of each boundary through training. We tested whether caudate population represented the position of each boundary by comparing the discrimination accuracy for the seven pairs of neighboring speeds (2\u20134, \u2026, 14\u201316) separately for each boundary and neuronal population (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We reasoned that the greater discrimination accuracy between pairs of neighboring speeds would correspond to the more accurate neuronal representation of the internal estimates of the boundary position. We found that immediately after the decision, the post-saccade population activity provided signals specific to all behaviorally relevant boundary positions. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> shows that high discrimination accuracy occurred for stimuli across the actual boundary positions (speed pairs 4/6 and 12/14), and across the average internal estimates of the boundary positions (6/8 and 10/12, respectively). <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> shows a different pattern during reward delivery. The strength of the discrimination accuracy peaked for the speeds across the actual boundary positions (4/6 and 12/14), but remained elevated for intermediate speeds regardless of the distance to the boundary. These differences in population read-out codes possibly reflect different putative synaptic pooling mechanisms, with the pooling during the reward period better suited to linking stimuli with dual class membership to the received outcome. We confirmed that this signal reflects categorical perception as opposed to representation of stimulus identity. We reasoned that any two stimuli should be discriminated better when they are judged to be in a different class as opposed to being in the same class. This is often referred to as the boundary accentuation effect (<a href=\"#bib17\">Goldstone, 1994</a>). The results in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a> confirmed this prediction, the average discrimination accuracy between the near boundary speeds (4/6 and 12/14) being significantly greater when the stimuli were classified in two different (slow vs fast) compared to the same (slow or fast) categories in both populations (psacc: 0.86 \u00b1 0.02 vs 0.63 \u00b1 0.02; rwd: 0.9 \u00b1 0.01 vs 0.82 \u00b1 0.01, permutation test, p &lt; 0.001). To understand the representation at the level of individual neurons, for each neuron we calculated a ratio difference index (Ratio Diff) measuring the difference in firing for two pairs of speeds (4/6 and 12/14) separately for slow and fast boundary trials. Consistent with the population findings, individual neurons had significantly larger differences in firing rate to the near boundary stimuli when in different categories compared to the same category both during the post-saccade (boostrap test, p &lt; 0.04) and reward (p &lt; 0.01) periods of the task (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that the caudate neuronal code parses information into behaviorally relevant categories and that the code is most informative for the stimuli with the most erroneous performance."

The accuracy of the monitoring signal was inversely related to behavioral proficiency, suggesting that the caudate nucleus allocates more efficient coding for changing and/or uncertain information critical for behavioral flexibility.

We found that individual neurons were highly selective at linking sensory and reward information. In other words, the neurons did not generalize across sensory inputs to code reward-related information. However, their population response provided a reliable and separable representation of both cognitive and motivational signals on a trial-by-trial basis. The reported monitoring signals in the caudate can reflect the outcome prediction and/or the rate of reward coding (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hollerman et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hassani et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cromwell and Schultz, 2003</a>).

Specifically, neurons in the head of the caudate nucleus represented changes in recent value of objects while monkeys made saccades to visual objects with different values and inactivation of this structure disrupted their behavioral preference for high value objects. While we also recorded in the anterior part of the caudate nucleus (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), our experimental paradigm was different. During the categorization task, monkeys had to maintained representation of both stable (i.e., always far from boundaries) and changing (i.e., near the boundaries) values of dot stimuli to perform successfully, well after the initial learning had occurred. Therefore, our findings are complementary to the aforementioned study because we showed that the caudate nucleus provides abstract cognitive monitoring signals beyond flexible reward associations. Taken together, these results suggest that the anterior caudate plays an important role in the change detection network (<a href=\"#bib23\">Isoda and Hikosaka, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pearson and Platt, 2013</a>) contributing to a rapid adjustment of behavior."

The present findings suggest that such selective gating in the caudate nucleus can occur via a neuronal population code, which allows for independent read-out of all task variables by downstream structures. In our experimental paradigm the direction of the dots motion was irrelevant for the speed categorization and the animals were never explicitly required to utilize that information. Yet, the accuracy of the population read-out for the dots motion direction in the caudate was suppressed near the boundary compared to that far from the boundary. These results suggest that the caudate nucleus sorts information by its relevance to the task at hand, possibly automatically, to potentially affect ongoing behavior (<a href=\"#bib4\">Badre, 2012</a>)."

We found that individual neurons provided a context-specific code, while their population read-out covered all aspects of behavior and multiple separable signals could be reliably extracted. Previous studies on visual categorization have shown that representation of multiple categories in the prefrontal cortex at the level of single neurons was either distributed or sparse depending on how much the visual categories overlapped (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cromer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Roy et al., 2010</a>). How these differences translate into population codes remains to be studied. The results of our experiment show that the caudate neuronal population code can reliably represent all aspects of cognitive complexity during flexible behavior."

All \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and treatments were in accordance with NIH guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Prior to the experiments each animal was implanted with a scleral search coil, head post and recording chamber under aseptic conditions using isoflurane anesthesia. The animals received postoperative analgesics during postsurgical recovery. The positions of the recording chambers were guided by monkeys' individual MRI atlases. The recording chamber (20 mm in diameter) for Monkey C was placed on the scull over the arcuate sulcus positioned at stereotaxic coordinates 20 mm anterior and 15 mm lateral allowing access to the anterior caudate nucleus via the frontal eye fields (FEF). Monkey F was sequentially implanted with two different recording chambers. The first recording chamber (20 mm in diameter) was placed at 25 mm anterior and 18 mm lateral positioned over the acruate sulcus. The second recording chamber (20 \u00d7 30 mm oval) was centered at 15 mm anterior and 12 mm lateral. We used tungsten or glass coated electrodes with impedance ranging from 1\u20133.5 M\u2126. The signals were amplified, filtered and passed to a real-time action potential detection. Action potentials were converted to TTL pulses that were stored together with the behavioral data. We also stored individual waveforms on each channel for further offline analysis. To identify the anterior caudate nucleus we used a number of criteria. We used depth measurements and identified the position of the caudate relative to the FEF. Also the dorsal edge of the caudate was identified by the presence of injury potentials. We identified the phasically active neurons by their low baseline activity (1\u20133 Hz). On each recording track we made sure to identify a tonically active neuron (4\u20138 Hz), in fact during some sessions we simultaneously recorded a pair of tonically and phasically active neurons. Post-saccade and reward neurons tended to be distributed without any distinct spatial organization in the associative caudate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Monkeys were trained to sit in a primate chair for the duration of the experiments with their heads restrained. They performed behavioral experiments and received liquid reward for correctly executing the behavioral task."

The stimulus set consisted of random-dot patterns moving at 8 different speeds (2, 4, 6, \u2026, 16 deg/s) with coherence equal to 1. The direction of random dot motion also varied randomly. On each trial, dot direction was selected from a set of two opposite directions. Generally, the directions were \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 although other axes of motion were also tried. Animals were never asked to judge the direction of dot motion, thus we consider this stimulus dimension as category-irrelevant. On a given trial, monkeys judged the speed of motion as \u2018slow\u2019 or \u2018fast\u2019 depending on one of two reference speeds. Each trial started with a fixation cue presented at the center of the computer screen. After animals fixated for 400 ms (baseline period), one of two boundary cues (blue or orange squares) indicating the reference speed was presented for 800 ms (cue period), followed by the random-dot stimulus together with two spatially located targets (decision period). Monkeys were trained to associate speeds faster than the reference with the green target and slower than the reference with the red target. They indicated their judgment by making a saccade within 800 ms to one of the targets, the positions of which were randomized across trials. Feedback was provided at the end of the trial. Correctly categorized stimuli were followed by two drops of water and a high tone, while incorrectly categorized stimuli were followed by a low tone and no reward.

We then normalized the average prediction accuracy by <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>^</mo></mover></mrow><mo>\u2212</mo><mi>c</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>\u2212</mo><mi>c</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>, where <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>^</mo></mover></mrow></math> is the average prediction accuracy and chance level is 0.125 or 0.5 for speed or boundary position decoding."

We believe that the post-decision signals reported in our study are not simply oculomotor responses reflecting task difficulty. During the speed categorization task, the most difficult decisions occurred near the boundaries. Monkeys had a hard time categorizing the speed of stimuli 6 and 12 when they were near the boundary, but not when the same stimuli were away from the boundary. Our behavioral analyses showed that task difficulty was similar between these two stimuli when categorized near the boundary. We reasoned that if a neuron coded task difficulty then it would respond similarly to the most difficult stimuli, independently of the boundary position. In contrast to this hypothesis we found that most individual neurons were selective to a particular category/boundary. To illustrate this point, we show an example neuron with differential response to the same stimulus (speed 12) when animals classified it into different categories (orange/blue corresponds to \u2018fast\u2019/ \u2018slow\u2019 respectively; <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a> left panel). This neuron did not differentiate responses to any other stimuli, including speed 6, even though behaviorally it was also difficult to categorize. We calculated a category index for this neuron (the same index used in the paper to quantify whether neurons respond differently to the same stimuli depending on the boundary position) to show that it differentiated difficulty for only one boundary (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>, right panel)."

Also, none of the neurons with category-specific responses (24 neurons) in the categorization task had significant difference in response to risky and safe rewards in the memory guided saccade task.

While we cannot directly address this question, because we did not manipulate attention/arousal in our task, we can outline different possibilities and provide tentative interpretations of the data. We tried to control for the effects of attention/arousal by having two category boundaries; since behavior is the most difficult around the boundary, it is equally difficult around each boundary. Reaction time is the most common behavioral index of arousal and attention. As discussed in the response to Review 1, RT did not vary as a function of stimulus proximity to the category boundary. Thus, a neuron coding attention/arousal would respond similarly between the two boundaries. Instead we found that many neurons differentiated responses near one, but not both boundaries. These results suggest that individual caudate neurons do not directly code attention/arousal during the flexible categorization task. However, the population level analysis revealed that cognitive information was more reliable near compared to away from the boundary. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that attention/arousal can possibly selectively enhance cognitive representation in the caudate nucleus to provide evaluation of specific on-going behavior (i.e. to improve read out of information on the most difficult decisions). Previously we found that the greater salience of risky outcome can possibly account for the better spatial selectivity in caudate neuronal population (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yanike and Ferrera, 2014</a>). Consistently, salience-related signals have also been found in the caudate nucleus (Asaad and Eskandar, 2011). These results suggest that the greater salience of uncertain or risky outcome can possibly account for better spatial and cognitive/contextual representation in the caudate nucleus."

In other words, the reward outcome or reward probability also varied with the boundary. As the reviewer correctly pointed out, the monitoring signals reported here could be related to reward coding. To address this question, we asked whether the post-decision neuronal activity systematically varied with the probability of reward for each session. We found that right after the decision some neurons (9 out of 31, 29%) coded the expectation of reward by either decreasing (8 neurons; <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 3A</a>) or increasing (1 neuron; <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 3B</a>) their firing rate with the probability of reward. During the reward delivery, some neurons (12 out of 23, 52%) also coded the probability of reward by decreasing their firing rate (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 3C</a>). These results show that the monitoring signals in the caudate can be related to the coding of expectation of reward and/or uncertainty right after the decision and the probability of outcome during the reward delivery. We suggest that the signals related to reward shape categorical representation in the caudate. While these motivational signals were highly context specific at the level of individual neurons, their population read-out provided a global evaluative signal. These results suggest that the motivational signals are necessary for context specific decisions to adapt to rapidly changing conditions. We have modified the Discussion section to incorporate these comments."

Are there any controls to rule out previous interpretations on the current database? Also, this reviewer would like more analysis on the presaccadic period with the same analytical tools used in your current version. He or she feels it critical to understand behavioral evaluation, by comparing the actual decisions with the outcomes. Although the BRE did not consider this very critical, this reviewer is concerned by the small database (38 neurons) used to characterize the functional properties of caudate in your task</i>."

In addition, we have performed a number of analyses to see if the neurons tracked any reward information. We looked at whether they followed reward history across trials. We found no evidence for that. It is tempting to speculate that monkeys didn\u2019t choose based on the reward value of each stimulus, but based on categorization uncertainty. By randomly selecting the category boundary on each trial, the outcome of previous trials is minimally useful. We\u2019ve done analyses to show that there is no cost of boundary switching on either accuracy or reaction time (<a href=\"#fig11\">Author response image 4</a>); no evidence of a win-stay, lost-shift strategy (<a href=\"#fig12\">Author response image 5</a>); or effect of previous trial speed, boundary or outcome on the current trial (<a href=\"#fig13\">Author response image 6</a>)."

We also analyze few sessions in which the reward amount was increased as the session progressed. Again, we found no change in the responses of neurons. However, a few cells did track the reward amount in a linear fashion, but they showed no modulated by the categorization task. We suggest that the neurons were more strongly modulated by the sensory cues and thus integrated all the information pertaining to the sensory cues. We would like to thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point."

However, we found that the activity of only a small fraction of neurons was modulated by the category boundary. Thus, we were not able to provide comparative analysis. One possibility is that the anterior caudate is primarily involved in post-decision monitoring when behavior is highly familiar yet flexible. This idea is consistent with recent findings by Ding and Gold, who have systematically compared neural correlates of perceptual categorization in three highly interconnected structures: FEF, LIP and caudate. They found that neurons with post-decision signals were more prevalent in the caudate compared to the other two areas (Ding and Gold, 2011)."

The task was very challenging and required collecting many trials to fully evaluate the rich flexible behavior. Thus we strived to get many trials per cell. We specifically designed our analysis to address this problem as we didn\u2019t want to simply average the responses of these neurons, but to evaluate them as a population. Thus we believe that the type of analysis we chose compensates for the number of cells."
