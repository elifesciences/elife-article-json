Here we identify two linked refining mutations within ISX that interact epistatically to increase binding affinity to the dosage compensation complex. Selection has increased the frequency of this derived haplotype in the population, which is fixed at 30% of ISX insertions and polymorphic among another 41%. Sharing of this haplotype indicates that high levels of gene conversion among ISX elements allow them to \u2018crowd-source\u2019 refining mutations, and a refining mutation that occurs at any single ISX element can spread in two dimensions: horizontally across insertion sites by non-allelic gene conversion, and vertically through the population by natural selection. These results describe a novel route by which fully functional regulatory elements can arise rapidly from TEs and implicate non-allelic gene conversion as having an important role in accelerating the evolutionary fine-tuning of regulatory networks."

Just as in humans, female flies are XX and males are XY; but having only one copy of the X chromosome means that male flies need to increase the expression of certain genes to produce a full-dose of the molecules made by the genes. This process is called dosage compensation and in 2013 the 77 ISX regulatory sequences on the fruit fly's X chromosome were shown to help recruit the molecular machinery that carries out dosage compensation to nearby genes, albeit inefficiently. Now Ellison and Bachtrog\u2014who also conducted the 2013 study\u2014report how these transposable elements have been fine-tuned to make them more effective for dosage compensation."

These mutations have also become more common in the fruit fly population by being passed on to offspring and increasing their survival. These two routes have accelerated the fine-tuning of these transposable elements for use in gene regulation. This implies that regulatory sequences derived from transposable elements evolve in a way that is fundamentally different from those that arise by other means, as the direct conversion between these insertions allows fine-tuning mutations to spread more rapidly."

Gene conversion is a major force shaping the evolution of repetitive regions, and interlocus or non-allelic gene conversion between sequence duplicates has been studied extensively for its role in concerted evolution (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ohta, 2010</a>). Non-allelic gene conversion also affects selection operating in gene families. Compared to single-copy genes, a family of gene duplicates presents a larger mutational target, and a mutation arising in any gene copy can be spread among copies by non-allelic gene conversion, thereby increasing the efficiency of both positive and purifying selection (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mano and Innan, 2008</a>). Non-allelic gene conversion homogenizes the arrays of ribosomal DNA gene copies present in the genomes of most organisms (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eickbush and Eickbush, 2007</a>), has generated allelic diversity within the human leukocyte antigen gene family (<a href=\"#bib30\">Zangenberg et al., 1995</a>), and has allowed palindromic genes on the human Y chromosome to escape degeneration (<a href=\"#bib25\">Rozen et al., 2003</a>)."

A propensity for some TEs to carry regulatory motifs and to insert adjacent to coding sequence gives them the potential for being potent modulators of gene regulatory networks (<a href=\"#bib15\">Feschotte, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cowley and Oakey, 2013</a>). The regulatory elements provided by these TEs, however, may be suboptimal in function, and subject to subsequent fine-tuning (<a href=\"#bib23\">Polavarapu et al., 2008</a>). Unlike regulatory elements where short binding motifs (10 basepairs on average for transcription factors; <a href=\"#bib27\">Stewart et al., 2012</a>) evolve de novo via point mutation or microsatellite expansion, binding sites that evolve from TEs are initially almost identical in sequence and are nested within a larger repeat unit (hundreds or thousands of basepairs in size), and may thus be subject to non-allelic gene conversion. Re-wiring of the dosage compensation network in <i>Drosophila miranda</i> was driven by TE-mediated amplification of a functional but suboptimal binding motif (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</a>). Here we show that non-allelic gene conversion is catalyzing the rapid fine-tuning of these suboptimal motifs by allowing sequence variants that optimize binding affinity to spread among elements."

We previously studied the acquisition of novel chromatin entry sites on newly formed X chromosomes in <i>D. miranda</i>, a species where two independent sex chromosome/autosome fusions resulted in a karyotype composed of three X chromosome arms, each of a different age (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alekseyenko et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). XL is homologous to the X chromosome of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and has been a sex chromosome for at least 60 million years (<a href=\"#bib24\">Richards et al., 2005</a>); chromosome XR formed roughly 15 million years ago when an autosome (Muller element D) fused to XL (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carvalho and Clark, 2005</a>), and the neo-X/neo-Y chromosome pair originated around 1.5 million years ago when the Y fused to another autosome (Muller element C) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bachtrog and Charlesworth, 2002</a>). Dosage compensation evolved on both XR and the neo-X shortly after their emergence, through acquisition of novel chromatin entry sites and co-option of the MSL regulatory network (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bone and Kuroda, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Marin et al., 1996</a>). Interestingly, we discovered that the acquisition of dosage compensation on both XR and the neo-X chromosome was in part mediated by the independent domestication of helitron transposable elements that contained MSL recognition motifs, which we have termed ISXR and ISX, respectively (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</a>)."

Our previous study showed that while amplification of ISX about 1 million years ago provided dozens of functional chromatin entry sites on the neo-X chromosome of <i>D. miranda</i>, the motif dispersed by ISX is distinct from the canonical motif that is enriched within chromatin entry sites on XL and XR, and shows significantly lower affinity to the MSL complex compared to motifs on XL and XR (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</a>). For these reasons, we postulated that the ISX binding motif is suboptimal, and predicted that refining mutations should accumulate within each MSL recognition motif until the neo-X chromosome becomes fully dosage compensated (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</a>)."

Using this approach we generated population data for 66 insertions out of the 77 total ISX insertions present in the MSH22 reference genome assembly.

Their high transposition rate and ability to supply ready-to use regulatory elements across the genome implies that they may rapidly wire new genes into regulatory networks (<a href=\"#bib15\">Feschotte, 2008</a>). We recently showed that domesticated TEs contribute to rewiring of the dosage compensation network in <i>D. miranda</i>, but appear to supply only suboptimal binding sites for the MSL complex (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</a>). Here, we identify a derived haplotype with two mutations that interact epistatically to increase binding affinity for the MSL complex. We show that these fine-tuning mutations spread among independent ISX insertions by non-allelic gene conversion, and through the population by natural selection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Relative to regulatory elements that evolve in isolation, a family of regulatory motifs dispersed by TEs presents a larger mutational target, and a mutation arising in any element contained within a larger repeat unit (the TE) can spread among copies by non-allelic gene conversion. Consequently, the rate of evolutionary fine-tuning at such regulatory elements can be greatly accelerated by increasing their effective population size (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mano and Innan, 2008</a>). Thus, transposable elements can \u2018crowd-source\u2019 beneficial mutations to rapidly fine-tune regulatory networks."

Over evolutionary time, such a mutation spreads in two dimensions: horizontally among TE-derived regulatory elements and vertically through the population, until it is fixed across elements and across individuals. The TT haplotype is at the midpoint of this process. Across ISX insertions, it is fixed, absent, and polymorphic, in approximately equal proportions."

Thus, TA or GT haplotypes should be selected against in the population if present on a functional ISX element. Consistent with the deleterious effect of individual T alleles, the TA and GT haplotypes are present on some ISY elements but completely absent from ISX, that is, we find the two T mutations to be in perfect linkage disequilibrium among ISX elements but not ISY (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). While most ISY elements carry the ancestral GA haplotype, a small fraction (0.7% of neo-X ISY insertions) instead carry the derived TT haplotype. It is therefore possible that the TT haplotype was introduced onto the ISX background by non-allelic gene conversion from ISY. Under this scenario, the large family of ISY elements in the <i>D. miranda</i> genome could be acting as a reservoir of natural variation, where complex mutations can accumulate in the absence of epistasis. Non-allelic gene conversion could then transfer these haplotypes to related repetitive elements (such as ISX). While many of these haplotypes are likely to be neutral or deleterious, some may be beneficial, as in the case of the TT haplotype. Such a scenario avoids the waiting time for a double mutation, as well as the fitness valley that would have to be traversed if the two mutations were to occur sequentially on the ISX background."

This process adds a new layer of complexity onto how TEs influence regulatory innovation, as well as a new context in which gene conversion affects genome evolution."

(Santa Cruz, CA) and the protocol described in <a href=\"#bib1\">Alekseyenko et al. (2013)</a>. Primers flanking the ISX MRE region were used to generate heterozygous amplicons from the MSL2 IP and input control. Sanger chromatograms were used in conjunction with polySNP software (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hall and Little, 2007</a>) to calculate relative abundance of ISX alleles within the IP and input control amplicons. Abundance of the \u2018T\u2019 alleles in the IP amplicons relative to the ancestral G/A alleles was calculated and normalized by the same values from the input control."

The test of selection we employed shows that given its frequency, the TT haplotype harbors significantly less variation than the GA haplotype (a test that is similar in spirit to the haplotype test of selection introduced by Hudson et al, Genetics 1994). We now also show that the frequency spectrum of TT-carrying haplotypes shows an excess of high frequency derived alleles, compared to the GA-carrying ISX elements (Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 3), which further strengthens the case that selection is operating on the TT haplotype."
