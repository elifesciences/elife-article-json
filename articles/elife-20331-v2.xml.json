Markers for distinguishing CRCs arising from \u2018serrated\u2019 versus \u2018conventional adenoma\u2019 precursors are lacking. We studied 36 human serrated CRCs and found CDX2 loss or <i>BRAF</i> mutations in ~60% of cases and often together (p<i>=</i>0.04). CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression in adult mouse intestinal epithelium led to serrated morphology tumors (including carcinomas) and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> potently interacted with CDX2 silencing to alter gene expression. Like human serrated lesions, CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant epithelium expressed gastric markers. Organoids from CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>\u2013mutant colon epithelium showed serrated features, and partially recapitulated the gene expression pattern in mouse colon tissues. We present a novel mouse tumor model based on signature defects seen in many human serrated CRCs \u2013 CDX2 loss and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. The mouse intestinal tumors show significant phenotypic similarities to human serrated CRCs and inform about serrated CRC pathogenesis."

Markers for distinguishing CRCs arising from \u2018serrated\u2019 versus \u2018conventional adenoma\u2019 precursors are lacking. We studied 36 human serrated CRCs and found CDX2 loss or <i>BRAF</i> mutations in ~60% of cases and often together (p<i>=</i>0.04). CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression in adult mouse intestinal epithelium led to serrated morphology tumors (including carcinomas) and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> potently interacted with CDX2 silencing to alter gene expression. Like human serrated lesions, CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant epithelium expressed gastric markers. Organoids from CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>\u2013mutant colon epithelium showed serrated features, and partially recapitulated the gene expression pattern in mouse colon tissues. We present a novel mouse tumor model based on signature defects seen in many human serrated CRCs \u2013 CDX2 loss and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. The mouse intestinal tumors show significant phenotypic similarities to human serrated CRCs and inform about serrated CRC pathogenesis."

Many CRCs likely arise via clonal outgrowth and evolution of an epithelial cell or cells in an adenomatous precursor lesion via so-called adenoma-carcinoma progression\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Fearon, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990</a>). But, upwards of 20\u201330% of CRCs may arise via an alternative pathway, often termed the 'serrated pathway', to reflect the saw-tooth or serrated morphology of the epithelial glands in the presumptive benign precursor lesions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jass, 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langner, 2015</a>). Serrated benign lesions arising in the colon and rectum include hyperplastic polyps (HPPs), sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSAs/SSPs), and traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langner, 2015</a>). HPPs comprise the vast majority of serrated benign lesions detected and are most often found in the distal colon and rectum (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langner, 2015</a>). SSAs/SSPs account for 5\u201320% of serrated benign lesions and arise more often in the proximal colon (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langner, 2015</a>). TSAs account for only about 1% of serrated benign lesions and arise mostly in the distal colon and rectum (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langner, 2015</a>). Some SSAs/SSPs and TSAs, such as those showing dysplasia, have potential to progress to CRC (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jass, 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langner, 2015</a>). HPPs do not show dysplasia and have generally been assumed to have negligible malignant potential (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langner, 2015</a>). However, in rare patients who develop HPPs along with other serrated colon polyps or in other patients with multiple and large HPPs, the lifetime risk of CRC is elevated (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jass, 2007b</a>). Hence, all three serrated benign lesion subtypes may have malignant potential, with SSAs and TSAs having higher potential than HPPs."

TSAs mostly have <i>KRAS</i> mutations (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>). In part because <i>BRAF</i> mutations are common in SSAs/SSPs and HPPs and not in conventional adenomas, it has been argued that CRCs arising from serrated precursor lesions may harbor <i>BRAF</i> mutations more often than CRCs arising from the conventional adenoma pathway (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langner, 2015</a>). <i>APC</i> mutations are rare or absent in serrated benign lesions and are perhaps also less common in CRCs arising from a serrated precursor (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langner, 2015</a>).

CRCs with serrated morphology (hereafter referred to as \u2018serrated CRCs\u2019) are presumed to arise mostly from serrated precursor lesions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>). Definitive biomarkers are lacking to identify the CRCs that arose from serrated precursors but lack serrated morphology at diagnosis. Importantly, clinicopathologic studies have suggested that serrated CRCs may pursue a more aggressive course than their conventional counterparts (<a href=\"#bib20\">Garc\u00eda-Solano et al., 2011</a>) Hence, to further define how molecular lesions may underlie the pathogenesis of CRCs arising from serrated precursors, we pursued in-depth molecular characterization of 36 CRCs with definite serrated morphological features at diagnosis, studying BRAF, KRAS, TP53, p16<sup>INK4A</sup>, Wnt, and CDX2 pathway defects by DNA sequencing or protein expression and CIMP-H and MSI-H status by standard marker analyses. Because frequent concurrent loss of CDX2 expression and <i>BRAF</i> mutation suggested their cooperation in the pathogenesis of serrated CRCs, we modeled concurrent biallelic inactivation of <i>Cdx2</i> (<i>Cdx2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) and expression of mutant BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in adult mouse colon epithelium via conditional somatic gene targeting approaches. Tumors arising in the mice and organoids derived from gene-targeted epithelium were studied and compared to human serrated CRCs in order to inform knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of serrated CRCs and to identify potential biomarkers of this group of poor prognosis tumors. Our novel mouse model should have utility for new prevention, diagnosis, and treatment approaches for this important biological and clinical group of CRCs."

We previously described <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup></i> transgenic mice, expressing a tamoxifen (TAM)-regulated Cre protein (CreER<sup>T2</sup>) under control of human <i>CDX2</i> regulatory sequences (<a href=\"#bib19\">Feng et al., 2013</a>). The transgene allows for TAM-inducible targeting of loxP-containing alleles in adult mouse terminal ileum, cecum, colon, and rectal epithelium. The median survival of <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice treated with TAM to activate Cre function and inactivate both <i>Cdx2<sup>fl\u00a0</sup></i>alleles (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blij et al., 2012</a>) in colon epithelium was greater than 480 days (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We also used the <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup></i> transgene to activate a conditionally oncogenic <i>Braf</i> allele (<i>Braf<sup>CA</sup></i>), which expresses normal BRAF until subjected to Cre-mediated recombination, resulting in expression of a mouse-human hybrid V600E oncogenic protein under the control of <i>Braf</i> endogenous regulatory elements (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dankort et al., 2007</a>). Regardless of the species of origin, we refer to this mutationally activated form of BRAF as BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and the <i>Braf<sup>CA</sup></i> allele after Cre-mediated recombination as <i>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i> for the sake of clarity. The median survival of <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Braf<sup>CA</sup></i> mice was greater than 480 days after TAM treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In marked contrast, the median survival of <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA</sup></i> mice was 103 days after TAM treatment to concurrently target the <i>Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> and <i>Braf<sup>CA</sup></i> alleles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The median survival of mice with simultaneous targeting of one <i>Apc<sup>fl</sup></i> allele together with <i>Cdx2<sup>fl</sup></i> and <i>Braf<sup>CA</sup></i> alleles was 158 days, indicating that inactivation of one <i>Apc</i> allele did not enhance tumor aggressiveness compared to the phenotype seen in <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

The intestinal epithelium in <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice treated with TAM showed marked hyperplastic changes and irregular bifurcation of the crypts, but no dysplastic features (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). When the TAM-treated <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA</sup> mice</i> were moribund, all of the mice had at least one large protuberant tumor (&gt;10 mm) or multiple polypoid lesions at the proximal colon-ileal-cecal junction and each mouse had 2\u20136 independent tumor lesions with size\u00a0&gt;2\u00a0mm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). All the tumors arising in <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA\u00a0</sup></i>mice showed both serrated and mucin-rich histological components (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The serrated components had a distinct serrated architecture with irregular bifurcation of the glands, and the cells in these glands have eosinophilic and abundant cytoplasm, and vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These characteristics closely resemble features of human serrated morphology CRCs. In the mucin-rich components, the glands were tubular or cystic, and lined by bland cuboidal and columnar cells containing abundant mucin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Using DNA samples isolated from the serrated or mucin-rich regions by laser-capture microdissection, we found the mucin-rich components had only inactivated both <i>Cdx2<sup>fl</sup></i> alleles, whereas the serrated histology epithelium had both <i>Cdx2<sup>fl</sup></i> alleles and the <i>Braf<sup>CA</sup></i> allele targeted (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). In the seven TAM-treated <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA</sup></i> mice studied, from 17\u201350% of the tumor lesions showed evidence that the serrated glands had invaded into the submucosa, indicative of carcinoma (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). Stochastic inactivation of the remaining wild type <i>Apc</i> allele in the setting of <i>Apc</i> hemizygous state in intestinal epithelium could potentially be seen as progression event in tumors initiated by other genetic drivers, such as in the setting of <i>Cdx2</i> biallelic inactivation and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> activation. We found that combined TAM-mediated targeting of an <i>Apc<sup>fl</sup></i>allele together with the <i>Cdx2<sup>fl</sup></i> and <i>Braf<sup>CA</sup></i> alleles in <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA</sup> Apc<sup>fl/+</sup></i> mice did not alter the histology of the tumor lesions compared to those arising in <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA</sup></i>mice with intact <i>Apc</i> alleles (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Furthermore, we saw no apparent selection for loss of the remaining wild type <i>Apc</i> allele in tumors arising in <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA</sup>Apc<sup>fl/+</sup></i> mice, as no \u03b2-catenin nuclear or cytoplasmic staining was seen in the <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA</sup> Apc<sup>fl/+</sup></i> mouse tumor tissues studied (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Our findings indicate concurrent <i>Cdx2</i> silencing combined with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression in mouse intestinal epithelium leads to premature death of the mice, due to the development of intestinal tumors, including carcinomas, and the tumors recapitulate histological features of human serrated morphology CRCs."

ANXA10 expression was not seen in any of the mucin-rich tumor components, where only <i>Cdx2</i> inactivation was present and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression was absent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The BRAF protein functions as an upstream activator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and similar to ANXA10 expression, phospho-ERK expression, indicating MAPK activation, was detected only in the serrated components of tumors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Similar to the infrequent nuclear or cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin staining and strong MUC5AC expression seen in most CDX2-defective and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant human serrated CRCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), we found membranous \u03b2-catenin staining, strong MUC5AC expression, and bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (indicating DNA synthesis) in the serrated components of the tumors in the <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA</sup>\u00a0</i>mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). No evidence for p53 nuclear protein accumulation was seen in the serrated and/or invasive components (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Consistent with a previous study showing that EGFR activation was found in majority of CRC cell lines harboring <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>\u00a0</i>mutation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Prahallad et al., 2012</a>), the tumors arising in the TAM-treated <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA</sup></i>mice showed significant higher levels of phospho-EGFR expression, compared to very low level of phospho-EGFR in <i>Cdx2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i>-mutant<i>, Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i>-mutant, or normal control mouse cecal epithelium (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). All tumors from 5 <i>CDX2P-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA</sup></i>mice were MSS, and we did not detect significant methylation at the <i>p16<sup>Ink4a</sup></i> promoter in the tumors (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In most human adenomas and CRCs, Wnt pathway defects, most commonly <i>APC</i> inactivating mutations, lead to dysregulated \u03b2-catenin/T cell factor (TCF) transcription with resultant activation of genes normally restricted to intestinal stem cells in many neoplastic cells in the lesions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fearon, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Koo and Clevers, 2014</a>). We studied <i>Cdx2</i>-mutant, <i>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i>-mutant, and <i>Cdx2 Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i> double-mutant, as well as <i>Apc</i>-mutant mouse colon epithelium, for expression of transcripts for various intestinal stem cell markers and Wnt pathway genes, such as: <i>Olfm4, Lgr5, Msi1, Cd133, Lrig1, Nkd1, Hopx, Bmi1, Cd44, Axin2, Mmp7</i>, <i>Ephb2, cMyc</i> and <i>Sox9</i>.

The principal components analysis showed the <i>Cdx2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i> mutant epithelium clearly had distinct global patterns of gene expression from that of normal colon epithelium or mutant colon epithelium of the single mutant genotypes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The gene expression patterns in <i>Cdx2</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup><i>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i>-mutant epithelium indicated that combined <i>Cdx2</i> inactivation and <i>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i> activation had very strong cooperative interactions in altering the expression of a large number of genes, with many genes dramatically activated in expression and a smaller collection of genes dramatically down-regulated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Interestingly, notwithstanding the data above showing that the ANXA10 protein was strongly expressed in human serrated morphology CRC and mouse <i>Cdx2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i> serrated tumor epithelium, it was still a surprise that <i>Anxa10</i> was the top activated gene in the <i>Cdx2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i>-mutant epithelium (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). <i>Cdx2</i> loss or <i>Braf<sup>V600E</sup>\u00a0</i>expression alone had only modest effect on <i>Anxa10</i> expression relative to levels in control epithelium, whereas concurrent <i>Cdx2</i> and <i>Braf<sup>V600E</sup>\u00a0</i>defects led to a roughly 100-fold activation of <i>Anxa10</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Interestingly, the <i>Pla2g2a</i> gene, which encodes a secretory phospholipase A2 protein and which is also known as <i>Mom-1</i> (<i>modifier of multiple intestinal neoplasia 1</i>) for its defined role as a potent genetic modifier of the <i>Apc<sup>Min</sup></i> intestinal neoplasia phenotype (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cormier et al., 1997</a>), was a non-induced gene in <i>Cdx2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i> -mutant epithelium compared to its induction in <i>Cdx2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mutant, <i>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i>-mutant, or <i>Apc</i>-mutant epithelium (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The top pathways for activated gene expression patterns in the <i>Cdx2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i>-mutant epithelium were epithelial-mesenchymal transition, KRAS signaling, and hypoxia, and the top pathways for down-regulated gene expression were cholesterol homeostasis, adipogenesis, and xenobiotic metabolism (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

Among these samples, we compared the 18 samples that had low CDX2 and BRAF V600E mutations to the 104 samples with high CDX2 that were not BRAF mutant, and selected the genes with <i>p</i>-values of\u00a0&lt;0.01 (two-sample T-test) and fold-changes of\u00a0&gt;1.3 between the two groups. Then, we computed the intersection of this selection to the similar selection we had performed in our mouse data to ask for significant Cdx2 by Braf interactions. We observed strong association between our mouse data and human CRC data with significant enrichment of genes found \u2018up\u2019 in both data-sets as well as \u2018down\u2019 in both data-sets, and few disagreements between both data-sets (p=4.5\u00d710<sup>\u221249</sup>, Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square test of association) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). In addition, we also compared our mouse gene signature to expression data for 8 serrated and 29 conventional CRCs obtained from GEO series GSE4045 (called here Finnish data) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Laiho et al., 2007</a>). Again, the genes that showed strong cooperative interaction between <i>Cdx2</i> loss and <i>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i> expression in the mouse colon tumors (either up or down) were found to be significantly enriched in human serrated CRCs vs. conventional CRCs (p=1.4\u00d710<sup>\u221211</sup>) (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). Our findings suggested that the gene signature found in our <i>Cdx2<sup>-/-</sup>/Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i> mouse model is highly instructive to identify the serrated subset of human CRCs."

In the normal mouse gastro-intestinal tissues studied, only gastric antrum epithelium and duodenum epithelium showed positive staining for PDX1, with no staining in epithelium from terminal ileum, cecum, colon and rectum (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We found PDX1 was expressed in 132 (33%) of the 395 CRCs studied (<a href=\"#SD9-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>), a percentage which is curiously not far from the upper estimate that 30% of CRCs may arise through a serrated pathway. Strong staining for CDX2 was seen in 287 (73%) of the 395 CRCs, with reduced but detectable CDX2 staining in 73 (18%) of the 395 cases and loss of CDX2 expression in 35 (9%) of the 395 cases (<a href=\"#SD9-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). ANXA10 expression, which was seen in 24 (67%) of the 36 human serrated CRCs, was only expressed in 26 (7%) of the 395 CRCs. These findings on ANXA10 expression, based on our data showing that only about 2/3 of serrated morphology CRCs express ANXA10, are not inconsistent with the published literature indicating that about 8\u201310% of all CRCs have serrated morphology. Because the 395 CRCs were represented as very limited tumor regions in the tissue microarray format, we could not reliably assess relationships of PDX1, CDX2 and ANXA10 staining in these CRCs relative to serrated morphology features."

Normal mouse colon epithelium-derived organoids formed uniform glandular structures in the presence of media supplemented with Wnt3a, R-spondin, noggin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The cells in the normal epithelium-derived organoids lacked dysplasia and resembled normal columnar colon epithelial cells. <i>Apc</i>-mutant (<i>Apc<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i>) mouse colon epithelium formed organoids in the absence of Wnt3a and R-spondin supplementation, as expected for cells with bi-allelic <i>Apc</i> mutations and constitutive activation of \u03b2-catenin/TCF transcription. The <i>Apc<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> epithelium-derived organoids were larger than normal epithelium-derived organoids, and the cells showed dysplasia, with larger and more irregularly shaped nuclei containing open chromatin and a loss of the normal basal polarity of the nuclei (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Organoids derived from Cdx2<sup>Null</sup> mouse colon epithelium were grown in the presence of the full growth factor supplementation, and the organoids showed minimal if any alterations in morphology relative to organoids derived from normal colon epithelium (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Organoids derived from CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant epithelium could be grown without EGF supplementation of the media, due presumably to constitutive BRAF\u2192MEK1/2\u2192ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling driven by the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> oncoprotein kinase. Initially, roughly 25% of the organoids derived from the CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant epithelium showed serrated glandular structures, with invaginations of epithelial cells into the organoid lumen, and epithelial cells with eosinophilic or clear and abundant cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei with distinct nucleoli, and loss of basal polarity of the cells, closely resembling mouse and human epithelium with serrated morphology (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). CDX2 expression was seen in all organoids where <i>Cdx2</i> gene function remained intact (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Strong and homogeneous PDX1 expression was found only in the CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant epithelium. After three-four in vitro passages of the CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant organoids, we observed a significant decrease in the percentage of organoids displaying serrated morphology, suggesting that serrated morphologic appearance as a phenotypic trait may not be stable in some neoplastic cell populations over time. To further explore the usefulness of the CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant organoids as a model system, we studied the gene expression by q-RT PCR for the top 15 genes showing positive interaction of CDX2 silencing and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression in mouse colon tissues and five more \u2018up\u2019 genes that are shared by our mouse data-set and one of the two human CRC data sets \u2013 the TCGA data-set or the Finish data-set (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 3</a>, marked as red). Interestingly, only 4 out of the 20 genes up-regulated in the in vivo setting (i.e., <i>Npy, Gkn2, Ivl</i> and <i>Tmprss11e</i>) showed significant cooperative interaction between CDX2 silencing and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression in the organoid model system (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and C</a>). Lower expression of <i>Anxa10</i> was found in the CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant organoids compared to the normal control or <i>Braf<sup>VE</sup></i> organoids (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and C</a>). The expression of <i>Npy, Gkn2, Ivl</i> and <i>Tmprss11e</i> as well as <i>Anxa10</i> in CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant organoids was markedly inhibited by MEK1/2-inhibitor (AZD6244) treatment. The effectiveness of AZD6244 treatment was verified by its inhibitory effect on expression of MAPK target genes<i>, Dusp6</i> and <i>Fos</i>, in all the organoids treated (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B and C</a>) and was also confirmed by its ability to significantly reduce the level of phospho-ERK (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

But, clinical, pathological, and molecular data suggest perhaps upwards of 20\u201330% of CRCs may arise from benign lesions with serrated glands, rather than conventional adenomas (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jass, 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langner, 2015</a>).

In the work presented here, we have provided new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of serrated morphology CRCs. We have described a novel mouse tumor model based on two signature molecular lesions present in many human serrated morphology CRCs, and we provide evidence that the mouse tumors manifest significant phenotypic similarities to human serrated morphology CRCs.

To address the potential cooperating roles of CDX2 loss and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression in human serrated morphology CRCs, we studied the consequences of conditional inactivation of <i>Cdx2</i> alleles, expression of a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant protein, or concurrent <i>Cdx2</i> inactivation and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant protein expression in mouse distal intestinal epithelium. We found concurrent <i>Cdx2</i> inactivation and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression had dramatic effects on mouse survival relative to either defect alone, with a median survival for the <i>CDX2-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Cdx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Braf<sup>CA\u00a0</sup></i>mice of only 103 days after conditional gene targeting.

Besides the <i>BRAF<sup>T1799A</sup> mutation</i>s that are often present in SSAs/SSPs, it has been argued that CRCs arising from proximal colon SSAs/SSPs will often manifest the CIMP-H and MSI-H phenotypes, with the CIMP-H phenotype reflecting hypermethylation of selected promoters, including that for the <i>MLH1</i> gene, leading to the MSI-H phenotype(<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jass, 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langner, 2015</a>). Some prior studies have shown CRCs with somatic <i>BRAF<sup>T1799A</sup>\u00a0</i>mutations, and that were not selected by morphological appearance, more often arise in the proximal colon than the distal colon or rectum, and these particular CRCs more often manifest the CIMP-H and MSI-H phenotypes than the bulk of CRCs(<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jass, 2007a</a>). However, in contrast to the notion that CRCs arising from serrated precursors are nearly always or even predominantly right-sided lesions with CIMP-H and MSI-H phenotypes, 17 of the 36 serrated morphology CRCs that we studied were rectal lesions and four were distal colon lesions, with only 15 of the 36 serrated morphology CRCs arising in the proximal colon. We did observe the CIMP-H phenotype more frequently in the human serrated morphology CRCs with CDX2 loss and <i>BRAF<sup>T1799A</sup>\u00a0</i>mutations (i.e., CIMP-H in 10 of 15 such cases) than in the CRCs lacking concurrent CDX2 loss and <i>BRAF<sup>T1799A</sup></i>mutations (i.e., CIMP-H in only 3 of 21 such cases). However, our 10 CIMP-H cases with concurrent CDX2 loss and <i>BRAF<sup>T1799A</sup>\u00a0</i>mutation included four cases arising in the rectum and only 2 of 10 CIMP-H cases displayed the MSI-H phenotype and had lost MLH-1 protein expression. Hence, our data imply that a potentially significant fraction of serrated morphology CRCs may arise from precursor lesions other than proximal colon SSAs/SSPs. Also, while CDX2-null/low and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant serrated morphology CRCs often manifested the CIMP-H phenotype, most serrated morphology CRCs lacking concurrent CDX2 and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> defects did not manifest the CIMP-H phenotype. In addition, the MSI-H phenotype was not significantly enriched in our 36 serrated morphology CRCs as a group (5 of 36 cases \u2013 14%) relative to the established prevalence of 15% in CRCs in general (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bettington et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fearon, 2011</a>). Consistent with our findings, a prior study reported that the MSI-H phenotype was only seen in 16% of serrated morphology CRCs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Garc\u00eda-Solano et al., 2010</a>)."

Prior serrated tumorigenesis models using conditional activation of a mutant <i>Kras</i> allele in the mouse intestinal tract together with concurrent <i>p16<sup>Ink4a</sup>/Arf</i> or <i>Pten</i> TSG inactivation(<a href=\"#bib6\">Bennecke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Davies et al., 2014</a>), can promote outgrowth of dysplastic lesions and occasionally progression of some lesions to carcinoma. However, our data suggest potentially uncertain relevance of <i>Kras</i>-mutation-based mouse models with respect to serrated morphology human CRCs, as only seven of the 36 (20%) serrated morphology CRCs that we studied had <i>KRAS</i> mutations and only two of the seven <i>KRAS</i>-mutant serrated CRCs had lost p16<sup>INK4A</sup> expression. Besides the modest-moderate frequency of <i>KRAS</i> mutations in human serrated CRCs, the low overall frequency of <i>PTEN</i> mutations in human primary CRCs raises some questions about the relevance of mouse models combining <i>Kras</i> activation and <i>Pten</i> inactivation to model serrated CRC. A prior mouse model has been reported where <i>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i> conditional activation in small intestine in concert with <i>p16<sup>Ink4a</sup></i> inactivation led to tumors with some serrated morphological features(<a href=\"#bib10\">Carragher et al., 2010</a>). While p16<sup>INK4A</sup> expression loss is common in <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i>-mutant human serrated CRCs, the prior BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-expressing and <i>p16<sup>Ink4a</sup></i>mutant mouse model developed tumors in many tissues besides the intestinal tract (e.g., liver, lung, stomach), limiting its utility. In another model of serrated pathway tumorigenesis, Rad <i>et al</i> showed that activation of <i>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i> specifically in mouse intestinal tissues instigated hyperplasia and dysplasia with serrated features, and a very small subset of the tumors progressed over time to invasive carcinomas (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rad et al., 2013</a>). However, the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced dysplastic lesions in this model showed features akin to human traditional serrated adenomas (TSA), which the authors reasoned might be due in part to the predominant location of the tumors arising in mouse small intestine. Our human serrated CRC data highlight additional gene defects that may cooperate with <i>Cdx2</i> inactivation and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression in our mouse model, such as <i>p16<sup>Ink4a</sup></i> and/or <i>Trp53</i> mutations, and restricted gene targeting to the terminal ileum, cecum and colon as permitted with the <i>CDX2-CreER<sup>T2</sup></i> transgene may be useful in future studies to determine how additional gene alterations collaborate with the CDX2 and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> defects in tumor progression and metastasis."

                        "text": "Among a number of poorly understood issues in the serrated precursor-CRC field is how to reconcile the estimate that upwards of 20\u201330% of CRCs may arise from serrated precursor lesions, yet only 8\u201310% of CRCs manifest serrated morphology at diagnosis. One possible explanation is that during progression to CRC the serrated morphological features present in a precursor cell population may be lost, due in part to the initiating gene lesions and additional genetic and epigenetic alterations, changes in the tumor microenvironment, or other mechanisms. Consistent with the view that phenotypic drift during neoplastic progression might contribute to why many fewer CRCs manifest serrated morphology at diagnosis relative to the fraction of CRCs estimated to arise from serrated precursors, we found the propensity of the CDX2<sup>Null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant mouse organoids to manifest serrated morphological features in culture decreased substantially over relatively few passages. Another possible issue of interest for the field is which biomarkers might identify the CRCs arising from serrated precursor lesions. Our data on ANXA10 and PDX1 expression may be interesting in this regard. Our findings indicate ANXA10 may not be expressed in all serrated morphology CRCs, with ANXA10 most often expressed in those cases with CDX2 loss and/or <i>BRAF<sup>T1799A</sup>\u00a0</i>mutations. On the other hand, PDX1 expression was seen in all benign serrated lesions studied and 83.3% of the 36 serrated morphology CRCs as well as 33% of nearly 400 CRCs selected without regard to specific morphological features. Further studies to define how PDX1 expression and perhaps ANXA10 expression might be used together with other biomarkers to identify the CRCs that arose from serrated precursor lesions may have possible diagnostic and prognostic relevance. Yet another unresolved issue for the serrated precursor-CRC field, and potentially one of greater significance for colorectal cancer screening recommendations in the general population in the future, is whether a potentially significant fraction of human CRCs arise from benign serrated lesions that are currently presumed to be of low malignant potential, such as HPPs in the distal colon and rectum, with or without <i>BRAF<sup>T1799A</sup></i>mutations, or proximal colon serrated lesions with <i>KRAS</i> mutations. The basis for this proposal is that our studies indicate that many human serrated morphology CRCs may arise in the distal colon and rectum, about half of the rectal and distal colon lesions lack <i>BRAF<sup>T1799A\u00a0</sup></i>mutations, and five of the seven KRAS-mutant serrated CRCs we studied arose in the proximal colon. Further in-depth studies of benign and malignant serrated morphology colorectal lesions in man and longitudinal studies of tumor features and progression in our mouse model may help to inform some of these and other issues about the pathogenesis and clinical features and significance of serrated benign lesions and serrated CRCs."

For the CpG island methylation analysis, sodium bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA and subsequent real-time PCR (MethyLight) were validated and done as previously described\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib43\">Weisenberger et al., 2005</a>). We quantified DNA methylation at five CIMP-specific promoters: CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3 and SOCS1. CIMP-high was defined as the presence of more than 3 of 5 methylated promoters, CIMP-low as the presence of 0 to 2 of 5 methylated promoters, according to the previously established criteria\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib44\">Weisenberger et al., 2006</a>)."

Three mice per group were used. Total RNA was extracted and purified from tumors or normal tissues at the colon-cecum junction. We used Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), which hold 41345 probe-sets, but we largely analyzed just those 25216 probe-sets that were mapped to Entrez gene IDs. Raw data was processed with the Robust Multi-array Average algorithm (RMA). Data is log2-transformed transcript abundance estimates. We fit a one-way ANOVA model to the five groups of samples. We supply a supplementary excel workbook that holds the same data as the series matrix file, but also holds the probe-set annotation at the time we analyzed the data, and some simple statistical calculations, which selects subsets of the probe-sets as differentially expressed between pairs of groups, as well as significant <i>Cdx2<sup>-/-</sup></i> by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> interactions. It also gives the homologous human gene IDs we used for enrichment testing, which were 1-to-1 best homologs according to build 68 of NCBI's Homologene.

The authors studied 36 serrated CRCs and found CDX2 loss and/or BRAF mutations in 60% of serrated CRCs. Having identified CDX2 loss and BRAF mutation as hallmarks of serrated CRC, the authors modeled these losses in the mouse and were able to demonstrate cause-and-effect of these alterations and recapitulate a number of features of human serrated adenomas and adenocarcinomas in the mice (Cdx2-/-, Brafmut). The development of the model is predicated on the observation that mutational activation of Braf and loss of Cdx2 expression are common events in human serrated tumors. This particular aspect of the work does not account for a number of published studies that have described the link between Braf, Cdx2 and serrated lesions; for instance Dawson et al., 2014 (PMID: 24166180, not referenced by the authors). Similarly, comprehensive mouse modelling work from Rad et al., showed that Braf is a driver of serrated polyposis (Rad et al., 2013). The current study provides evidence that Cdx2 loss directly contributes to the progression of CRC through the serrated pathway. The model will likely be a useful tool for those studying progression of serrated colonic tumors. Unfortunately, the manuscript is descriptive and does not offer any explanation for why Cdx2 might play such a role in serrated tumor progression. Too often the authors offer correlation as a surrogate of causation, and do not provide direct evidence linking genotype to phenotype."

More importantly, the magnitude in gene expression changes does not correlate with the animal model. For instance, ANXA10 is suppressed ~50%, in contrast to the 100-fold change seen in mice. Further, the other 3 genes analyzed show moderate (50%) changes with CDX2 overexpression alone, with only a mild increase in suppression following BRAFi treatment. Also, it is questionable that \"the additive effects of CDX2 ectopic expression and BRAF or MAPK inhibition\" are shown by western blot in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>. There is no apparent additional suppression of PDX1 with MEK or BRAF inhibition. Finally, why were these genes chosen? Do other genes on the list show the same trend?"

As we now present in the manuscript text and a new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, only a subset of the genes dramatically upregulated in mouse CDX2<sup>null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>colon epithelium and human serrated colon cancers are similarly dramatically upregulated in the CDX2<sup>null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>organoid model system. Our findings suggest that the ex vivo organoid model system cannot fully recapitulate the gene expression patterns seen in serrated mouse and human colorectal tumors, further highlighting the importance of in vivo models to study how distinct gene lesions can functionally cooperate to generate tumor phenotypes. We present data in the revised <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> to show that pharmacologic inhibition of MEK signaling can dramatically inhibit the expression of four genes that were potently up-regulated by the cooperative interactions between <i>Cdx2</i> inactivation and <i>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></i>activation. The intent of the MEK pharmacological inhibition studies was simply to show that downstream inhibition of signaling strongly inhibits the ability of Braf<sup>V600E</sup> to cooperate with Cdx2 inactivation in regulation of gene expression. Future studies may address how BRAF inhibitors might be used for patients whose serrated tumors harbor BRAFV600E defects, but we do not emphasize potential therapeutic issues related to BRAF inhibition in our manuscript."

More importantly, the magnitude in gene expression changes does not correlate with the animal model. For instance, ANXA10 is suppressed ~50%, in contrast to the 100-fold change seen in mice. Further, the other 3 genes analyzed show moderate (50%) changes with CDX2 overexpression alone, with only a mild increase in suppression following BRAFi treatment. Also, it is questionable that \"the additive effects of CDX2 ectopic expression and BRAF or MAPK inhibition\" are shown by western blot in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>. There is no apparent additional suppression of PDX1 with MEK or BRAF inhibition. Finally, why were these genes chosen? Do other genes on the list show the same trend?</i>"

Beyond the issue of the APC mutation in HT29 cells, a challenge with the approach of using the HT29 human colon cancer cell line to study cooperation of CDX2 and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in modulating gene expression is that the approaches used in vitro are the inverse of the situation in in vivo; i.e., combined Cdx2 inactivation and Braf<sup>V600E</sup> activation in vivo versus ectopic CDX2 expression and/or BRAF inhibition in the HT29 in vitro system. As noted above in our response to point #2, we have now used CDX2<sup>null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> organoids to undertake studies to define the effects of MEK inhibitors downstream of BRAF activation on selected genes that were potently activated in CDX2<sup>null</sup>/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mouse colon epithelium (See <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 3</a> for list of genes that were chosen), and these new data are presented in an entirely new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, as discussed above in Point #2. Because of the reviewer concerns about the limitation of the HT29 studies and data, we have removed them from the revised manuscript."

Among these samples, we compared the 18 samples that had low CDX2 and V600E mutations to the 104 samples with high CDX2 that were not BRAF mutant, and selected the genes with p-values of &lt;0.01 (two-sample T-test) and fold-changes of &gt;1.3 between the two groups. Then, we computed the intersection of this selection to the similar selection we had performed in our mouse data to ask for significant Cdx2 by Braf interactions. We observed strong association between our mouse data and human CRC data with significant enrichment of genes found \u201cup\u201d in both data-sets as well as \u201cdown\u201d in both data-sets, and few disagreements between both data-sets (p=4.5x10<sup>-49</sup>, Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square test of association). We now present these new data in a significantly revised figure and new supplement (i.e., <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). In addition, we also compared our mouse gene signature to expression data for 8 serrated and 29 conventional colorectal cancers obtained from GEO series GSE4045 (called Finnish data) (Laiho et al. 2007). Again, the genes that showed strong cooperative interaction between Cdx2 loss and Braf<sup>V600E</sup> expression in the mouse colon tumors (either up or down) were found to be significantly enriched in the human serrated CRCs vs. conventional CRCs (p=1.4x10<sup>-11</sup>) (presented in a new <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). Our findings suggest that the gene signature found in our Cdx2<sup>-/-</sup>Braf<sup>V600E</sup> mouse model is highly instructive to identify the serrated subset of human CRCs, either in the TCGA data or in other available data sets."
