Breakdown of peri-photoreceptor vascular demarcation leads to retinal angiomatous proliferation or choroidal neovascularization, two variants of vascular invasion of the photoreceptor layer in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of irreversible blindness in industrialized nations. Here we show that sFLT-1, an endogenous inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), is synthesized by photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and is decreased in human AMD. Suppression of sFLT-1 by antibodies, adeno-associated virus-mediated RNA interference, or Cre/lox-mediated gene ablation either in the photoreceptor layer or RPE frees VEGF-A and abolishes photoreceptor avascularity. These findings help explain the vascular zoning of the retina, which is critical for vision, and advance two transgenic murine models of AMD with spontaneous vascular invasion early in life."

Breakdown of peri-photoreceptor vascular demarcation leads to retinal angiomatous proliferation or choroidal neovascularization, two variants of vascular invasion of the photoreceptor layer in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of irreversible blindness in industrialized nations. Here we show that sFLT-1, an endogenous inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), is synthesized by photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and is decreased in human AMD. Suppression of sFLT-1 by antibodies, adeno-associated virus-mediated RNA interference, or Cre/lox-mediated gene ablation either in the photoreceptor layer or RPE frees VEGF-A and abolishes photoreceptor avascularity. These findings help explain the vascular zoning of the retina, which is critical for vision, and advance two transgenic murine models of AMD with spontaneous vascular invasion early in life."

The bottom layer of the retina is composed of rods and cones\u2014neurons that are directly sensitive to light\u2014and is called the photoreceptor layer. Rods function primarily in dim light and provide black-and-white vision, while cones support daytime vision and are responsible for colour perception. Unlike the upper layers of the retina, the photoreceptor layer does not contain blood vessels: oxygen and nutrients are instead provided by a structure just underneath the retina called the choroid."

The completely avascular photoreceptor layer of the retina lies between the vascular inner retina (on its apical aspect) and the highly vascularized and permeable fenestrated choriocapillaris (<a href=\"#bib11\">Blaauwgeers et al., 1999</a>) (on its basal aspect) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The choroid, which has the highest flow of any vascular bed (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bill et al., 1983</a>), fulfills the metabolic and oxygen demands of the retinal pigmental epithelium (RPE) cells and photoreceptors. In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), angiogenic vessels from the inner retina extend into the photoreceptors (retinal angiomatous proliferation, or RAP), or from choroidal vessels breaching through the complex of the RPE and Bruch\u2019s membrane (BrM) into the subretinal space (choroidal neovascularization, CNV). Either can disrupt retinal structure and function, causing irreversible vision loss (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ambati et al., 2003b</a>). Although AMD is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the West (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ambati et al., 2003b</a>), its etiology has not been fully elucidated."

Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is a potent angiogenic factor with a crucial role in both normal and pathologic vascular growth within the eye (<a href=\"#bib47\">Saint-Geniez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Saint-Geniez et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rajappa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carmeliet Jain, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Potente et al., 2011</a>), and its increased expression is linked to pathologic proliferation of abnormal, highly permeable vessels into the avascular photoreceptor layers (<a href=\"#bib7\">Amin et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ambati et al., 2003b</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rajappa et al., 2010</a>). A soluble isoform of VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1, also known as sFLT-1) acts as a naturally occurring inhibitor of VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kendall and Thomas, 1993</a>). sFLT-1 negatively regulates VEGF-A action: first, it binds and sequesters VEGF-A; and second, by heterodimerizing with membrane-bound VEGF-receptor-2, it prevents VEGF-A occupancy and subsequent signal transduction (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kendall et al., 1996</a>). Excess levels of sFLT-1 strongly inhibit CNV in mice and monkeys (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lukason et al., 2011</a>). In addition, we previously demonstrated that endogenous sFLT-1 is both necessary and sufficient for corneal avascularity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ambati et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, we hypothesized that avascular photoreceptor privilege depends on sFLT-1 and that a deficiency of endogenous sFLT-1 might be involved in CNV or RAP development."

In situ hybridization and immunostaining confirmed the presence of sFLT-1 mRNA and protein, respectively, in photoreceptors and RPE, which indicated that both cell types can synthesize and express sFLT-1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Compared with VEGF-A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), the relative expression pattern of soluble FLT-1 to VEGF is higher in the photoreceptors than in the inner vascular layers of the retina. A theoretical implication is that VEGF is prominent in the inner vascularized retina, the layer which harbors blood vessels and neurons, while sFLT-1 is prominent in the outer avascular retina, consistent with our initial hypothesis. Furthermore, sFLT-1 was principally detected on the basal aspect of the RPE\u2013BrM complex, facing the vascularized choroid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). In contrast, in the RPE, VEGF-A localizes on both basal and apical surfaces, consistent with a prior report (<a href=\"#bib11\">Blaauwgeers et al., 1999</a>). This polarized distribution is reminiscent of sFLT-1 expression in the cornea, where the highest levels of sFLT-1 are found in the perilimbal region counterposing the vascularized conjunctiva (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ambati et al., 2007</a>). This is consistent with VEGF\u2019s vasculotrophic role in the choroid and neurotrophic role in the photoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib47\">Saint-Geniez et al., 2008</a>). The different ratio and polarities of VEGF-A and sFLT-1 would likely strike a reasonable balance to maintain a healthy photoreceptor layer and choriocapillaris while preventing vascular invasion of the subretinal space."

First, we injected a neutralizing antibody against FLT-1 into the subretinal space in wild type mice. This resulted in increased free VEGF-A levels (n = 10; p<i>&lt;</i>0.005) and induced CNV (n = 10, p<i>&lt;</i>0.00005; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), suggesting that sequestration of VEGF-A by FLT-1 maintains subretinal avascularity. Next, we administered FLT-1 neutralizing antibody (which occupies domains 1\u20134 of this receptor) via subretinal injection in <i>Flt-1 tk</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, which are deficient in the tyrosine kinase domain of membrane-bound FLT-1 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hiratsuka et al., 1998</a>).

This accords with prior studies which have found that soluble but not membrane-bound FLT-1 plays a key role in anti-angiogenic regulation, based on the finding that germline <i>Flt-1</i> deletion leads to embryonic lethality due to vascular endothelial hyperplasia, while membrane-bound <i>Flt-1</i> lacking the tyrosine kinase domain is sufficient for normal vascular development in mice (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fong et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kappas et al., 2008</a>)."

To determine if PlGF is essential for CNV, we performed subretinal injections of anti-FLT-1 and isotype control antibody in wild type mice and found no significant difference in PlGF expression between both groups at day 3 (n = 9; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) or at day 10 (undetectable levels). Taken together with the above finding that FLT-1 antibody induced CNV in <i>Flt-1 tk</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (in which VEGF-B signaling would be expected to be inoperative), this indicates that CNV induced by FLT-1 blockade is mediated by desequestration of VEGF-A, not of PlGF or VEGF-B. Moreover, neither PlGF nor VEGF-B are able to compensate for VEGF-A during its blockade, and mice lacking either factor display only minor developmental defects (<a href=\"#bib40\">Malik et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, it is well established that, in contrast to VEGF-A, VEGF-B is neither induced by hypoxia nor essential to angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hoeben et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). Although VEGF-B is dispensable for blood vessel growth, it is critical for blood vessel survival in pathological conditions (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). However, our findings do not exclude a role for VEGF-B in RAP or CNV. Knocking down sFLT-1 could increase VEGF-B activity and promote the longevity of CNV lesions after formation rather than promote angiogenesis. However, this pro-survival function is mediated through membrane-bound FLT-1."

Moreover, anti-VEGF antibodies may affect the quantification of VEGF and PlGF, and another consideration is that the particular ELISA used may measure \u2018non-free\u2019 VEGF or PlGF (bound to sFLT-1) as well. To clarify these questions, we performed the following series of experiments. First, we determined whether the neutralizing anti-FLT-l antibody affected the measurement of mouse VEGF-A and PlGF-2, the only isoform of this protein present in mice by ELISA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In this assay, almost all VEGF-A (62.5 pg/ml) would be expected to bind FLT-1 (100 ng/ml) based on an assumed Kd = 10 pM (free VEGF-A can be estimated to be 1.36 pg/ml by Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics). The ELISA showed less detection of VEGF-A and PlGF after saturation with excess recombinant FLT-1, that is, it did not detect non-free VEGF-A and non-free PlGF-2. These data demonstrate that non-free VEGF or non-free PlGF-2 is not being detected at significant levels by our ELISA technique."

After coating ELISA plates with FLT-1 and then incubating with VEGF-A or PlGF-2, Flt-1 neutralizing antibody was added. The results demonstrate that FLT-1 neutralizing antibody released VEGF-A but not PlGF-2 from recombinant FLT-1. Although the exact reason for this is unknown, it is possible that FLT-1 neutralizing antibody may change the FLT-1 conformation, affecting binding of FLT-1 to VEGF-A but not PlGF-2."

                                "text": "Our second strategy was a post-transcriptional selective knockdown of sFLT-1 via subretinal injection of adeno-associated viral (AAV) delivery of a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting sFLT-1 (AAV.shRNA.<i>sFlt-1.Gfp</i>). We have previously shown that this shRNA is selective to sFLT-1 and does not affect membrane-bound FLT-1 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ambati et al., 2006</a>). We further confirmed this by western blot (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As controls, shRNA (AAV.shRNA.<i>Gfp</i>), viral vector expressing non-specific cargo (AAV.<i>Gfp</i>), or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was injected into the subretinal space. Subretinal delivery of AAV.shRNA.<i>sFlt-1.Gfp</i> demonstrated efficient transduction of the RPE and the photoreceptor layer (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We analyzed CNV and measured VEGF-A at 4 weeks after subretinal injection instead of 10 days as above, as AAV-mediated subretinal gene delivery usually takes a longer time before expression (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shao et al., 2012</a>). Compared to controls, treatment with AAV.shRNA.<i>sFlt-1</i>.<i>Gfp</i> resulted in downregulation of sFLT-1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), increased free VEGF-A (n = 10; p<i>&lt;</i>0.05; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), and induced CNV (n = 10; p<i>&lt;</i>0.05; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Furthermore, as we reported recently (<a href=\"#bib39\">Luo et al., 2013</a>), AAV.shRNA.<i>sFlt-1</i> induced primary CNV (defined as a CNV that initially occurred at the injection site), as well as secondary CNV (defined as a lesion that is more than \u00bd a disc diameter from the primary CNV lesion, and that shows no leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA) at least 2 weeks after injection) 4 weeks after injection. This phenomenon was not found in the controls, although insignificant CNV developed initially due to injury. The length of time required for secondary CNV occurrence might derive from the time to and long duration of AAV-mediated gene expression in the mouse eye which has previously been demonstrated (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schlichtenbrede et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kjellstrom et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shao et al., 2012</a>). To further determine if CNV induced by sFLT-1 inhibition is attributable to VEGF-A, we repeated the above set of AAV-mediated sFLT-1 knockdown studies in <i>Vegfa</i><sup><i>lox/lox</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gerber et al., 1999</a>). The reduction of VEGF protein in RPE cells via subretinal delivery of a plasmid encoding Cre recombinase (pCre) in <i>Vegfa</i><sup><i>loxp/loxp</i></sup> mice was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Cre expression was verified by western blot (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Increased VEGF-A expression in the RPE/choroid (n = 10; p<i>&lt;</i>0.0005) and CNV (n = 10; p<i>&lt;</i>0.05) in <i>Vegfa</i><sup><i>lox/lox</i></sup> mice treated with subretinal AAV.shRNA.<i>sFlt-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) was suppressed by subretinal delivery of pCre. This confirms that the release of sequestered VEGF-A is requisite for CNV development following sFLT-1 antagonism. We observed that the sFLT-1 fluorescence signal became stronger after subretinal injection in treatment or control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) eyes compared to normal eyes without injury (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The higher sFLT-1 expression might be due to the inflammatory reaction following injury."

To determine whether the CNV/RAP lesions we observed were due to preceding retinal changes, we performed IHC staining on sections of VMD-<i>Creflt</i><sup><i>loxp/loxp</i></sup> mice at p7, p14, and p21. No CNV lesions were seen on retinal sections at these timepoints.

In contrast to the transgenic mice which develop CNV in senility (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ambati et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Imamura et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>) or a model of RAP in the systemic VLDLR<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mouse (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heckenlively et al., 2003</a>), the mouse models presented herein exhibit CNV or RAP in heterozygous transgenic mice as well and within a rapid timeframe, indicating the vital role of sFLT-1 in maintaining the integrity of photoreceptor avascular privilege. Moreover, previous studies found that transgenic mice which overexpress VEGF-A in either RPE or photoreceptors developed intrachoroidal neovascularization or retinal neovascularization but not CNV or RAP (<a href=\"#bib42\">Okamoto et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schwesinger et al., 2001</a>). These phenomena suggest that overexpression of VEGF-A in the retina or RPE is not sufficient to overcome the subretinal vascular barrier to induce CNV. On the other hand, in our study, mice with reduced sFLT-1 expression in the RPE developed CNV, indicating that sFLT-1 down-regulation is sufficient to cause CNV. Hence, the ratio of soluble FLT-1 to VEGF is likely critical to the maintenance of the subretinal vascular barrier. We believe physiologic sFLT-1 is not disruptive to normal neural function due to both a critical balance and the polarity of sFLT-1 expression by RPE. Further, the models presented herein more closely mimic human AMD, rendering these transgenic models quite useful for further studies and translational applications."

This method has been widely used for estimating CNV volumes in vivo, especially in AMD patients, and has proved to be a highly reproducible quantitative measurement (<a href=\"#bib25\">Joeres et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Giani et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Luo et al., 2013</a>). B-scans were exported from Heidelberg Eye Explorer (HEE), Heidelberg\u2019s image analysis software, in .jpeg format and imported as complete stacks into Seg3D software. Seg3D is a segmentation processing and analyzing tool developed by the University of Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute and the NIH/NCRR Center for Integrative Biomedical Computing (Volumetric Image Segmentation and Visualization, Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute [<a href=\"#bib17\">Furino et al., 2009</a>], available at <a href=\"http://www.seg3d.org\">http://www.seg3d.org</a>). Boundaries of the CNV lesion and deformations of the RPE were manually outlined using a polyline tool by a masked and experienced technician (<a href=\"#bib39\">Luo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). Seg3D masked the region enclosed within the polyline for each consecutive b-scan in pixels squared. An automated feature of Seg3D calculated two-dimensional lesion area, summing the masked b-scans for each stack. Scaling factors obtained from HEE were used to convert pixel<sup>2</sup> to \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>. After adjusting for murine corneal curvature to 1.4 mm (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahlers et al., 2008</a>), the scaling factors for both x- and z-axes were 1.45 \u00b1 2 and 3.87 \u03bcm/pixel, respectively. To calculate lesion volume (\u03bcm<sup>3</sup>), the lesional area on each scan line was multiplied by the distance between scans (52 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm; provided by HEE software), and then summated. Finally, estimated volumes were converted to mm<sup>3</sup> and reported."

This group had previously published a study that linked <i>sFlt-1</i> expression in the cornea to the avascularity of the cornea. In order to test the normal function of <i>sFlt-1</i> the authors have blocked <i>sFlt-1</i> via three different, independent approaches: anti-sFLT-1 antibody, <i>sflt-1</i> conditional knockouts, and <i>sflt</i>-siRNA. Each one of the three approaches has its weaknesses, but the fact that each approach has the same outcome makes the overall study quite compelling. The model created by eliminating <i>sFlt-1</i> is of general interest since a simple KO of RPE <i>sFlt-1</i> yields a reproducible choroidal neovascular (CNV) response, i.e., a model for wet AMD without surgical intervention. Even more interesting is the observation that conditional KO of <i>sFlt-1</i> in RPE causes CNV whereas a conditional KO of <i>sFlt-1</i> in photoreceptors yields retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP). The authors suggest that reduced levels of <i>sFlt-1</i> in the retina may be linked to diseases where blood vessels invade the photoreceptor layer, such as AMD."

Looking at the OCTs in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, we would struggle to quantify changes here. Most importantly, how can CNVs be distinguished in this image modality from fluid build-up due to leakage? Why have the authors not used IHC to visualize the CNVs in whole mounts? This would make the CNV quantification data much more reliable. A similar criticism applies to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>. Why have the authors not used a vessel specific stain to show CNVs? It is impossible to be certain that vascular changes have occurred based on the H&amp;E; stains shown.

It would be nice to see this both in cross-section and in flatmounts of isolated retinas and eye-cups with the retina removed (to see the RPE en face).
