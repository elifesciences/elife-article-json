Here we stimulated fly neurons with different paradigms and identified ARGs using high-throughput sequencing from brains as well as from sorted neurons: they included a narrow set of circadian neurons as well as dopaminergic neurons. Surprisingly, many ARGs are specific to the stimulation paradigm and very specific to neuron type. In addition and unlike mammalian immediate early genes (IEGs), fly ARGs do not have short gene lengths and are less enriched for transcription factor function. Chromatin assays using ATAC-sequencing show that the transcription start sites (TSS) of ARGs do not change with neural firing but are already accessible prior to stimulation. Lastly based on binding site enrichment in ARGs, we identified transcription factor mediators of firing and created neuronal activity reporters."

Here we stimulated fly neurons with different paradigms and identified ARGs using high-throughput sequencing from brains as well as from sorted neurons: they included a narrow set of circadian neurons as well as dopaminergic neurons. Surprisingly, many ARGs are specific to the stimulation paradigm and very specific to neuron type. In addition and unlike mammalian immediate early genes (IEGs), fly ARGs do not have short gene lengths and are less enriched for transcription factor function. Chromatin assays using ATAC-sequencing show that the transcription start sites (TSS) of ARGs do not change with neural firing but are already accessible prior to stimulation. Lastly based on binding site enrichment in ARGs, we identified transcription factor mediators of firing and created neuronal activity reporters."

This activity-dependent gene regulation is important as it affects the ability of an animal to convert transient stimuli into long-term changes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huh et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kandel, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nestler, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Spitzer et al., 2000</a>). Hundreds of IEGs, including those specific to tissues and stimulation paradigms, have been identified in mammals since the discovery of the first neuronal IEG, c-<i>fos,</i> by Greenberg and his colleagues in 1986 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Greenberg et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Herschman, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Spiegel et al., 2014</a>). Expression of these IEGs are induced within an hour, usually with big amplitudes (over 10 fold), and many IEGs are shared between different types of neurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Spiegel et al., 2014</a>). Functionally, these IEGs are highly enriched for transcription factors, which subsequently trigger a secondary transcriptional response (<a href=\"#bib51\">Spiegel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">West and Greenberg, 2011</a>). The secondary response genes (SRGs) in contrast take longer to induce (a typical assay is 6 hr post-stimulation), are involved in many different processes, are more neuron-specific and function at least in part to promote neuron survival, dendritic morphogenesis and regulate synapse formation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bloodgood et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hong et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lin et al., 2008</a>)."

For example, different stimulation paradigm-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry routes initiate different downstream pathways and lead to induction of distinct IEGs (<a href=\"#bib60\">West and Greenberg, 2011</a>). Stimulations other than neural firing like growth factors also induce IEG expression, many of which are the same as those induced with neural firing (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jones et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tullai et al., 2007</a>). Depending on the induction dynamics, Tullai <i>et al.</i> divided the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced IEGs in human T98G glioblastoma cells into primary response genes (PRGs) and delayed response genes (DRGs). Dramatic differences were shown between the two categories in terms of their functions, gene lengths, chromatin accessibility and RNA polymerase II occupancy at promoter regions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fowler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kim et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tullai et al., 2007</a>). PRGs are usually optimized for rapid induction (such as shorter gene length and more permissive chromatin at promoters), whereas DRGs are not different from other genes in the genome. Notably, PRGs and DRGs are induced independent of protein-synthesis (\u2018cycloheximide-insensitive\u2019), whereas SRGs are protein-synthesis dependent (\u2018cycloheximide-sensitive\u2019)."

Moreover, only one genome-wide study using microarrays had been performed more than a decade ago to identify seizure-induced ARGs from fly heads (<a href=\"#bib19\">Guan et al., 2005</a>). More high-throughput studies on <i>Drosophila</i> ARGs are therefore needed, not only for identification and to provide mechanistic insight but also to design new tools to serve as indicators of neuronal activity."

Fly ARGs vary with the individual stimulation paradigm and are surprisingly cell type-specific. Fly ARGs are also more functionally diverse and have longer gene lengths compared to mammalian ARGs. Chromatin at transcription start sites (TSS) of fly ARGs is more accessible at baseline than other expressed genes but does not change with stimulation. Lastly, we used bioinformatics to identify key transcription factors that mediate ARG activation. Based on these factors, we generated novel luciferase reporters for in vivo monitoring of neuronal firing."

Several of these induced transcription factors encode proteins with high sequence identity to well-known mammalian IEGs: HR38 shows 67% identity to nuclear receptor subfamily four group A member 2 (NR4A2); SR has 82% identity to early growth response protein 3 (EGR3); CBT is 61% identical to Krueppel-like factor 11 (KLF11). Taken together, firing neurons with <i>ChR2-XXL</i> identified known as well as novel ARGs in flies, and the enrichment of transcription factors in ARGs suggests some mechanistic similarity between flies and mammals."

The levels of most ARGs continue to increase until the last time point assayed (60 min); only a few transcripts like <i>cbt</i> (2.6 kb) reach maximum expression levels at 30 min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Since shorter gene length enables the rapid induction of IEGs in mammals (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tullai et al., 2007</a>), we examined the gene lengths of fly ARGs. Surprisingly, the average ARG gene is longer than that of all annotated genes as well as of all genes expressed in neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, gene annotation obtained from FlyBase (<a href=\"ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/dmel/dmel_r5.2_FB2007_01/fasta\">ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/dmel/dmel_r5.2_FB2007_01/fasta</a>)).

In contrast, the canonical mammalian IEGs <i>c-fos</i> and <i>c-jun</i> are only\u00a0~\u00a03.4 kb and\u00a0~3.2 kb respectively.

For shorter genes such as <i>CG14186</i> (5.7 kb), the stimulation-induced increases are smaller at the nascent RNA level, presumably because much less time is required for transcription elongation and polyadenylation. More importantly and unlike the longer genes, there is no delay between the nascent and mRNA peak times for the shorter genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). The data taken together indicate that the long gene lengths of some prominent ARGs reduce the mRNA induction rates due to the time required for nascent events like transcriptional elongation."

Transcript changes in specific neurons may therefore be invisible with assays from brains and heads, especially if there is significant cell-type specificity in the transcriptional response to neuronal firing. To address this possibility, we performed mRNA deep sequencing on sorted green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled DA and PDF+ neurons expressing <i>dTrpA1</i> with or without a temperature shift, namely, the same <i>dTrpA1</i> paradigm used for brains. DA and PDF+ neurons are two distinct populations and serve different functions in flies. Each brain has about\u00a0~120 DA neurons and\u00a0~16 PDF+ neurons. Flies expressing only the <i>GAL4</i> drivers were used as a control for heat-induced genes."

Since baseline ATAC-seq profiles are robust and minimally affected by genetic background (unpublished data from Rosbash lab), baseline chromatin profiles from ARGs induced by the other paradigms were pooled for analysis. These ARGs, like the <i>dTrpA1-</i>induced ARGs, also show higher accessibility than the rest of the genome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This is unlikely due to higher baseline expression levels; only KCl-induced ARGs show significantly higher baseline expression levels despite showing intermediate chromatin accessibility of the three firing paradigms (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 3</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

Because it is possible that the temperature shift can lead to neuronal firing, e.g., by activating endogenous <i>dTrpA1</i>, there is currently no clear distinction between heat- and firing-induced genes. Future experiments with other tools like <i>ChR2-XXL</i> may be able to provide more information. In any case, the neuron-specific ARGs probably contribute to different physiological responses, which contribute in turn to distinct behavioral responses (<a href=\"#bib20\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ueno et al., 2012</a>).

As only the first 60\u201390 min after stimulation was assayed, it is possible that the small fold-changes reflects a slower induction time course in flies than in mammals. Another possibility is that the nature of the firing, e.g., firing rate, has an impact on the induction amplitudes, time courses and even the genes induced. The differences between the three stimulation paradigms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) indicate that this possibility may have some merit. Nonetheless and taken together with the stimulation-paradigm and cell type-specific induction of ARGs, the modest fold-changes at 60\u201390 min helps explain the long-standing failure to identify <i>bona fide</i> and well-accepted ARGs in flies."

Considering the much smaller genome size and gene size of flies compared to mammals and the potential slower transcription elongation rates in flies, the long gene lengths and large first introns of fly ARGs may counterintuitively serve to significantly slow down induction rates (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ardehali and Lis, 2009</a>).

Mammalian IEGs are largely shared between different types of neurons such as excitatory and inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Spiegel et al., 2014</a>), but fly ARGs like SRGs appear quite tissue-type specific, i.e., many genes are only induced in one of the tissue types tested despite similar baseline levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mardinly et al., 2016</a>). This is in line with the fact that fly neurons appear quite heterogeneous, e.g., they have distinct transcript enrichment and electrophysiological properties (<a href=\"#bib34\">Liang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nagoshi et al., 2010</a>). Although unlikely in our view, it remains possible that PDF+ and DA neurons are outliers and that ARGs in most other neurons are less cell type-specific. Nonetheless, we hypothesize that specific ARGs are an important feature of neuronal identity and play a role in neuron-specific physiological properties. As an example, preliminary analysis indicates that the PDF cell-ARGs are a subset of the mRNAs that undergo circadian oscillations within these neurons ([<a href=\"#bib32\">Kula-Eversole et al., 2010</a>] and data not shown)."

A less stereotyped response may be generally characteristic of invertebrates. Even non-mammalian vertebrates may be quantitatively if not qualitatively different from mammals. For example, induction of IEGs like <i>fos</i> and <i>egr1</i> was also observed in birds and zebrafish but with smaller increases (about 4 to 6-fold) than human and mice (usually well above 10-fold) (<a href=\"#bib4\">B\u00e9bien et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Burmeister and Fernald, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lopes et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mokin and Keifer, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Moore and Whitmore, 2014</a>). However, more high-throughput data are required to determine if the non-mammalian vertebrates resemble more closely flies or mammals. In addition, different stimulation paradigms were employed in the non-mammalian vertebrate studies, making the data less comparable. In any case, one can imagine that mammals need a more potent initial transcriptional system than flies to respond to firing. Not only are mammalian neurons bigger with more and longer processes, but they also have much larger genomes (longer genomic DNA and more enhancers to bind); both of these factors may require higher levels of transcripts to generate a required higher abundance of transcription factors. The increase may be required to activate the thousands of enhancers in mammals rather than the hundreds in flies, and/or more structural proteins are needed to change the morphology of \u2018giant\u2019 mammalian neurons."

Although no further opening is observed with firing, it is possible that more subtle changes such as histone modifications occur and are not detectable with ATAC-seq (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In the cases of mammals, histones around IEGs promoters are modified to be more accessible to transcription factors at baseline; the modification levels could be even higher with firing (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim et al., 2010</a>).

This was not only to amplify the signal but also to avoid the situation in which a particular promoter is only responsive in certain neurons or to certain types of stimulation. We thought this was likely considering that ARGs are stimulation paradigm- and cell type-specific. Indeed, we tried many Janelia Research Campus GAL4 drivers, which use different regions of the <i>hr38, sr</i> and <i>cbt</i> promoters for neural activity monitoring, but they were all either unresponsive or generated very low luciferase levels (data not shown)."

The study identified 12 ARGs (including previously known ARGs, hr38 and striped) that overlap in the three paradigms but also revealed a large number of stimuli-specific ARGs, suggesting that neurons may respond differently to different stimuli. The authors further performed RNAseq on small groups of neurons isolated by cell sorting (Dopaminergic and Pdf neurons, stimulated by the dTrpA1-strategy) and found that although there were some overlaps, many genes were cell type specific. In addition, the authors investigated the chromatin accessibility of the ARGs pre- and post-stimulation and found that in contrast to mammalian IEGs that show some changes in chromatin structure upon stimulation, the fly ARGs are in an open chromatin state to begin with. Together with the findings that fly ARGs are not enriched for transcription factors and small genes, the authors find an interesting difference between mammalian IEGs and <i>Drosophila</i> ARGs, and conclude that fly ARGs are more similar to mammalian secondary response genes (SRGs) or delayed response genes (DRGs). Finally, using the information from these experiments, the authors generated five Luciferase-based reporters and show that three of them show some stimulation induced activation in vivo."

Identification of new ARGs and showing a proof-of-principal that this information can be used to generate new tools is valuable. In addition, pan-neuronal and subtype specific transcriptomic profiles of neurons treated with different stimulations are also unique and interesting datasets that can be further mined to extract interesting biological information. The finding that, in <i>Drosophila</i>, activity-induced transcription happens downstream of the level of chromatin accessibility will also allow researchers to begin to study the similarities and differences in the mechanism of activity-dependent gene activation between different model organisms. Finally, although not optimized yet, construction of several luciferase based neuronal activity reporter further adds value to this paper. As such, it is likely to be of broad interest and appropriate for publication in <i>eLife</i>; however, there are a few issues that must first be addressed:"

The authors speculate this could be reflecting some gene expression changes in non-neuronal cells (glia etc.), global changes that happen independent of neuronal activation (light-response, heat-shock response) or the difference in in-vivo versus ex-vivo experiments. One possibility that the authors do not discuss is the strength and duration of the stimulation. Based on the Methods section, the ChR2 paradigm stimulates the flies only for 30 seconds at the beginning and follow transcriptional changes, while dTrpA1 and high K<sup>+</sup> paradigms continuously activate the neurons for the entire duration (up to 60/90min). If the authors perform a longer stimulation in ChR2 flies, they may see more genes that overlap with the other 2 paradigms. Also, in order to determine if the difference between high-K<sup>+</sup> stimulation and the other two paradigms are simply due to differences in-vivo and ex-vivo sample preparation, the authors can perform an ex-vivo experiment for the ChR2 and dTRPA1 flies as well and see how that may affect the list of ARGs. Considering that additional RNAseq may require significant time, effort, and cost, the authors can select several high-confident hits from each of the paradigms (see major point 1) and test them via qPCRs or other methods."

However, they do not show how these reporters behave in the other two stimulation paradigms (dTrp1A, high K<sup>+</sup>). Was there a reason the author only focused on ChR2-ARGs? Is the binding site of Lola, Eip78 and Relish enriched in ARG genes activated by the other two paradigms? How do these reporters (and the two that didn't respond to ChR2-activation) behave when stimulated with dTrp1A and high-K<sup>+</sup>? Since a key conclusion that the authors draw from their RNAseq data is that stimulation paradigms make a big difference, the authors should test their reporter under different stimulation conditions. In addition, the authors should comment on whether their reporter signal is strong enough that they can be used to visualize neuronal activity in all (e.g. elav-GAL4) or subpopulation (e.g. TH-GAL4, Pdf-GAL4) of neurons."

The authors speculate this could be reflecting some gene expression changes in non-neuronal cells (glia etc.), global changes that happen independent of neuronal activation (light-response, heat-shock response) or the difference in in-vivo versus ex-vivo experiments. One possibility that the authors do not discuss is the strength and duration of the stimulation. Based on the Methods section, the ChR2 paradigm stimulates the flies only for 30 seconds at the beginning and follow transcriptional changes, while dTrpA1 and high K<sup>+</sup> paradigms continuously activate the neurons for the entire duration (up to 60/90min). If the authors perform a longer stimulation in ChR2 flies, they may see more genes that overlap with the other 2 paradigms. Also, in order to determine if the difference between high-K<sup>+</sup> stimulation and the other two paradigms are simply due to differences in-vivo and ex-vivo sample preparation, the authors can perform an ex-vivo experiment for the ChR2 and dTRPA1 flies as well and see how that may affect the list of ARGs. Considering that additional RNAseq may require significant time, effort, and cost, the authors can select several high-confident hits from each of the paradigms (see major point 1) and test them via qPCRs or other methods.</i> "

How do these reporters (and the two that didn't respond to ChR2-activation) behave when stimulated with dTrp1A and high-K<sup>+</sup>? Since a key conclusion that the authors draw from their RNAseq data is that stimulation paradigms make a big difference, the authors should test their reporter under different stimulation conditions.

For dTrpA1 at least, the data back this up with lots of heat shock genes induced by the temperature shift even without dTrpA1. We later found that the 3 positive transcription factors are also enriched for the other two stimulation paradigms. We didn\u2019t test the reporters by monitoring ex vivo brains with the KCl paradigm. First, we are somewhat fixated on awake-behaving flies as we are developing these reporters and currently using them as a real time monitoring tool for living animals (see below).

Somewhat surprisingly perhaps, all reporters including the two negative ones responded to the 21\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C temperature shift, without UAS-dTrpA1 as well as with (data not shown), suggesting that heat may increase the activity of many transcription factors. Although heat can also fire some neurons, the induction here is more likely due to heat alone since the levels of induction are indistinguishable between the experimental and control flies for all reporters. The observation also suggests that these reporters are not exclusively responsive to neuronal firing. However, we cannot at present exclude the possibility that this is an artifact, for example a temperature effect on luciferase reporter activity. We cannot sort this out within the time frame of returning the manuscript, so the assay of the reporters remains restricted to ChR2 in this paper, where fortunately we have convincing negative controls."
