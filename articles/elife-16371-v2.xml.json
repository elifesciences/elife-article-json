Here, we combined long-term behavioural data on feeding and travelling with six years of field experiments in a wild chimpanzee community. In the experiments, subjects engaged with natural logs, which contained energetically valuable honey that was only accessible through tool use. Engagement with the experiment was highest after periods of low fruit availability involving more travel between food patches, while instances of actual tool-using were significantly influenced by prior travel effort only. Additionally, combining data from the main chimpanzee study communities across Africa supported this result, insofar as groups with larger travel efforts had larger tool repertoires. Travel thus appears to foster tool use in wild chimpanzees and may also have been a driving force in early hominin technological evolution."

Here, we combined long-term behavioural data on feeding and travelling with six years of field experiments in a wild chimpanzee community. In the experiments, subjects engaged with natural logs, which contained energetically valuable honey that was only accessible through tool use. Engagement with the experiment was highest after periods of low fruit availability involving more travel between food patches, while instances of actual tool-using were significantly influenced by prior travel effort only. Additionally, combining data from the main chimpanzee study communities across Africa supported this result, insofar as groups with larger travel efforts had larger tool repertoires. Travel thus appears to foster tool use in wild chimpanzees and may also have been a driving force in early hominin technological evolution."

When the ecological conditions were the most demanding, wild chimpanzees engaged most with the honey-trap experiment, an experiment where they had to use a tool to extract honey from a cavity dug in a log. Chimpanzees spent a longer time engaging with the apparatus when not much food was available and they had to travel more to obtain it. However, actual tool use during the experiments was only influenced by the travel effort made by the chimpanzees before they engaged with the log, not by how much fruit they had eaten beforehand."

Furthermore, these results can be extrapolated to humans, who both travel further and use a greater variety of tools than chimpanzees."

Recent work in non-human primate species has focussed on the role of ecological variables for the emergence of tool use (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fox et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Humle and Matsuzawa, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">M\u00f6bius et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Spagnoletti et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sanz and Morgan, 2013</a>). These studies have enlightened our understanding of how ecology influences animal culture (<a href=\"#bib84\">Whiten et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Laland and Janik, 2006</a>) and are also informative for modelling early hominin lifestyle (<a href=\"#bib81\">Susman and\u00a0Hart, 2015</a>)."

While the invention hypothesis states that new forms of tool use are rare chance events, which spread through social learning (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fox et al., 2004</a>), the necessity and opportunity hypotheses state that ecological factors can have an additional influence (<a href=\"#bib76\">Sanz and Morgan, 2013</a>). While the necessity hypothesis predicts that tool use emerges as a response to food scarcity, the opportunity hypothesis predicts this emergence as a response to encounters with either the material needed to make a tool or the resources to be extracted by the tools (<a href=\"#bib42\">Koops et al., 2013</a>). The current literature has generated conflicting and inconclusive results concerning the different ecological hypotheses, even within the same species (chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes verus</i>; necessity: <a href=\"#bib87\">Yamakoshi, 1998</a>; opportunity: <a href=\"#bib42\">Koops et al., 2013</a>; inconclusive: <a href=\"#bib19\">Furuichi et al., 2015</a>); capuchins (<i>Sapajus</i> spp., necessity: <a href=\"#bib51\">Moura and Lee, 2004</a>; opportunity: <a href=\"#bib80\">Spagnoletti et al., 2012</a>); bonobos (<i>Pan paniscus</i>; inconclusive: <a href=\"#bib19\">Furuichi et al., 2015</a>); see (<a href=\"#bib76\">Sanz and Morgan, 2013</a>) for a review)."

This hypothesis states that tool use can develop as a strategy to obtain dietary components difficult to obtain without tools, but only if this is more profitable than non-tool-based strategies and as long as the ecological conditions, such as low predation pressure, allow it (<a href=\"#bib74\">Rutz and St Clair, 2012</a>)."

(2014)</a> proposed an enlarged opportunity hypothesis, which includes not only ecological but also social and cognitive opportunities as drivers of tool use innovation and maintenance. In this view, necessity cannot explain tool use in animals because of the lack of correlations between selected environmental indicators and tool use. In particular, in a study with unhabituated chimpanzees of Nimba forest, Guinea, there was no correlation between fruit availability and ant remains in faeces, a proxy for stick use (<a href=\"#bib42\">Koops et al., 2013</a>). Additionally, there was no relation between feeding-related tool use variants and the number of dry months across chimpanzee sites through Africa, further suggesting that tool use did not emerge out of necessity (<a href=\"#bib43\">Koops et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, support for the necessity hypothesis comes from another study with the nearby habituated chimpanzees of Bossou, Guinea, where nut-cracking increased when fruit availability was low, suggesting that tool use is a fall back strategy during periods of food scarcity (<a href=\"#bib87\">Yamakoshi, 1998</a>)."

For instance, <a href=\"#bib76\">Sanz and Morgan (2013)</a> argue that the abundance of preferred food is a poor proxy for necessity and that even low levels of these foods may not be sufficient to trigger significant behavioural changes. Second, necessity may be driven by the lack of particular micronutrients essential for survival but that do not account for a major part of the diet (<a href=\"#bib76\">Sanz and Morgan, 2013</a>). Necessity-based tool inventions, in other words, may not always function to compensate for low caloric intake. A third problem with the necessity hypothesis may also be due to the narrow focus of the analyses conducted to test it, e.g. feeding opportunities determined through phenological surveys, with no data on (a) whether animals actually seize these opportunities, (b) their variation across large timescales (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gruber et al., 2012a</a>), (c) the energetic costs incurred to benefit from them (<a href=\"#bib62\">Pontzer and Wrangham, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lehmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amsler, 2010</a>), and (d) the differential needs of individuals across time. In this respect, while analysing entire communities or populations can be useful, for instance by correlating phenological variables with tool use frequencies or tool repertoire sizes of entire communities (see below), individual needs may differ substantially within groups, suggesting that additional levels of analysis may be necessary to test the necessity hypothesis."

These cases were distributed over 16 different experimental days (11 with a single tool-user, five with two successive tool-users). For each trial, we determined the preceding travel and ripe fruit feeding behaviour of the subject by systematically varying the time periods before each experiment (ranging from 1 to 13 weeks). To this end, we determined the proportion of all scans that contained travel and ripe fruit feeding for the focal individual of the test subject\u2019s party. This is a reasonable approach since members of a chimpanzee party typically engage in the same behaviour at a given time (see Material and methods)."

Specifically, when subjects fed little on ripe fruits, they engaged more with the apparatus, provided they also travelled much.

Each of these models included the interaction between ripe fruit feeding and travel. We found that only the 1-week model was significantly different from its corresponding null model (LRT: 1 week: <sub>X</sub><sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a012.0, df\u00a0=\u00a05, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0346, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.30; 7 weeks: <sub>X</sub><sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a07.6, df\u00a0=\u00a05, p\u00a0=\u00a00.1810, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.19; 13 weeks: <sub>X</sub><sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a08.5, df\u00a0=\u00a05, p\u00a0=\u00a00.1299, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.18). Contrary to the previous engagement time model, we did not find any effect of the interaction between ripe fruit feeding and travel time on the likelihood of tool use (all p&gt;0.1, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). However, we found a significant main effect of travel time on the probability of tool use, which increased with travel time (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> top panel). No such result was found for ripe fruit feeding, although the effect went into the expected direction (i.e., more tool use with less ripe fruit feeding). For the other two time periods, the estimated effects of travel time and ripe-fruit feeding also went into the expected directions (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Our data first showed that the combination of low ripe-fruit availability and high travel effort increased their motivation to engage with a foraging problem that required tool use. Specifically, in situations of low fruit availability, the subjects spent more time engaging with the apparatus than at times of high ripe fruit availability, suggesting that they were possibly more inclined to explore alternative hard-to-get food possibilities. Our second finding was that tool use was mainly driven by short-term changes in daily travel, and less so by fruit availability. Specifically, tool use increased with increasing amounts of travel before the experiment, but this was mostly a short-term effect, up to one week prior to an experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that travel generates extra energetic costs in situations of low fruit abundance and that tool use is more likely to appear if ecological situations force chimpanzees to explore alternative feeding options in situations of high energy expenditures."

While tool use was interpreted as a fall back strategy in response to food scarcity in Bossou (<a href=\"#bib87\">Yamakoshi, 1998</a>), in line with the original definition of necessity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fox et al., 1999</a>), this effect may not be observed in communities that do not display habitual feeding-related tool use behaviour, such as Sonso. The Budongo Forest has been described as a rich habitat where periods of extreme food scarcity are absent (<a href=\"#bib56\">Newton-Fisher, 1999</a>), which may prevent chimpanzees from experiencing extreme necessity. Food availability nevertheless undergoes seasonal fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib72\">Reynolds, 2005</a>) and, over the last decade, the food supply has noticeably gone down, in part due to anthropogenic activities (<a href=\"#bib3\">Babweteera et al., 2012</a>). The Sonso chimpanzees have responded with behavioural adaptations to the disappearance of their original food resources (<a href=\"#bib71\">Reynolds et al., 2015</a>), which suggests that detailed analyses are needed to better understand how food variation affects chimpanzee behaviour. Overall, our results suggest that chimpanzees are more eager to exploit difficult resources when the ecological conditions are more demanding relative to average conditions, both in terms of low food availability and high amounts of energy required to obtain the food. While high travel effort in itself is not necessarily linked with low diet quality in chimpanzees (e.g. <a href=\"#bib73\">Riedel et al., 2011</a>), our analyses show that a combination of the two favours the exploration of alternative food resources, which creates opportunities for acquiring new tool behaviours. We interpret these findings as support for the more general idea that necessity can also drive invention in wild chimpanzees, when energetic demands are high. Necessity, in other words, is likely to be a major factor in driving the emergence of tool use behaviour in chimpanzees, if it is redefined to take into account both energetic costs and opportunities to compensate these costs. These results underline the importance of individual-based analyses that take into account data on both energetic expenditure and intake, with potentially important implications for theories about the origin of tool use behaviour."

If increased travel effort represents an extra energetic cost, then tool use is a relatively more profitable strategy, especially if this occurs in ecologically challenging situations, which may trigger the switch from non-tool to tool-based foraging. Interestingly, the chimpanzees of Budongo Forest have increased their crop raiding habits over the last decade (<a href=\"#bib82\">Tweheyo et al., 2005</a>), a probable response to a general decrease in food availability in the forest (<a href=\"#bib3\">Babweteera et al., 2012</a>). As such, the innovation of novel tool use may only be one possible reaction to a changing environment, highlighting the flexibility of chimpanzees in dealing with changes in food availability (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hockings et al., 2015</a>). Another facet of the relative profitability hypothesis is that tool use may provide individuals with a selective advantage over non-tool-using individuals (<a href=\"#bib58\">Patterson and Mann, 2011</a>), as it provides them access to an energetically valuable resource, although in only 7% of trials did subjects succeed to do so. Perhaps this is not so surprising as tool use innovation is itself rarely observed in the animal kingdom (<a href=\"#bib79\">Shumaker et al., 2011</a>) and only some species will develop tool use under identical ecological conditions (<a href=\"#bib74\">Rutz and St Clair, 2012</a>), a reasoning that may apply at the population or individual level, as suggested by the current study."

Here, one important result of our study is that the large majority of the tool-using individuals (19 of 21 cases, 90.5%) applied a familiar technique, leaf-sponging, in the experiment, behaving much different from when extracting honey from natural bee nests with their hands. Nevertheless, while adapting an existing behaviour to a novel context may be considered an innovation (<a href=\"#bib69\">Reader and Laland, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Reader et al., 2016</a>), only two individuals chose a different technique by attempting to use sticks. However, these two individuals did not incorporate this behaviour into their repertoire, raising questions about how wild chimpanzees represent artefacts as potentially useful tools (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gruber et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gruber, 2016</a>).

In our study, engagement with the apparatus overlapped between social contexts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), suggesting that the presence of others did not prevent subjects from engaging with it. However, it is less clear how the presence of others influenced the use of tools. Six individuals used a tool while being alone, seven others while in the company of family members, and eight in the company of other group members, to the effect that the current study cannot disentangle the relative role of social competition. Although tool-users spent more time with the apparatus and consumed more honey (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gruber (2016)</a> and see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), it is unlikely that this was because they monopolized the log. Rather, these individuals had developed a successful technique to recover the honey, compared to others who abandoned the apparatus earlier (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gruber, 2016</a>). However, social influences are also in terms of social learning opportunities. As described elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gruber, 2016</a>), chimpanzees were generally tolerant to each other, but it is unclear whether they learnt from each other that leaf-sponge use was a suitable solution to extract honey. Social learning is a reasonable explanation for three individuals, but individual learning cannot be ruled out, largely because leaf-sponging was already part of their behavioural repertoire. Nevertheless, wild chimpanzees can learn socially from each other, even in a competitive context, and it is equally possible that this may even enhance social learning as it facilitates close observations of the novel behaviour (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hobaiter et al., 2014</a>)."

While it is important to quantify the food available over the entire home range, it is also important to take into account the temporal variation of food availability and its consequences on the relative attractiveness of alternative foods simultaneously available to individuals, even for foods as attractive as honey. We concur with <a href=\"#bib43\">Koops et al. (2014)</a> that individuals must be exposed to the right ecological opportunities, in our case the honey-trap apparatus, and that the probability of tool use may directly depend on the frequency with which they will encounter this challenge, a parameter we controlled for in our experiment. For tool acquisition and spread to appear, the right social settings may also have to be present (<a href=\"#bib76\">Sanz and Morgan, 2013</a>), under the form of opportunities for close observation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hobaiter et al., 2014</a>). In our case, encountering tools left by others (i.e. discarded sticks) did not appear to constitute a sufficient condition for social learning (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gruber et al., 2011</a>). Our data also suggest that individual differences need to be taken into account. Finally, while cognitive abilities are likely to play a part in innovation and learning (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gruber, 2016</a>), the emergence of tool use may also depend on whether it is relatively more profitable to do so, at any given time (<a href=\"#bib74\">Rutz and St Clair, 2012</a>).

Our analysis of nine chimpanzee communities, although limited by the availability of published data on travel effort and tool use, suggests that our findings represent a general pattern. This analysis corroborated our empirical findings that travel effort and fruit consumption have opposing effects on tool repertoire size, and that travel effort, which arguably is best represented by the average daily distance walked by the chimpanzees, is likely to be more important than fruit consumption in explaining variation in tool repertoires between chimpanzee populations. In the long run, with more chimpanzee communities being currently habituated spanning across their entire ecological range (e.g. savanna in\u00a0Fongoli, <a href=\"#bib66\">Pruetz, 2006</a>), future studies will have to disentangle how environmental changes influence the relationship between tool use, energy intake and expenditure across a larger sample of chimpanzee populations. Regarding other great apes, both gorillas (genus\u00a0<i>Gorilla</i>) and most orangutans (genus\u00a0<i>Pongo</i>) show limited to no feeding-related tool use and interestingly they spend significantly less time travelling per day compared to chimpanzees, which suggests that their energy requirements are lower (<a href=\"#bib62\">Pontzer and Wrangham, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pontzer et al., 2016</a>). Nevertheless, because travel is mostly arboreal in orangutans, more work is needed to estimate how this compares to chimpanzees, particularly with respect to Sumatran orangutans (<i>Pongo abelii</i>) for whom interesting variation in feeding-related tool use behaviour has been described (<a href=\"#bib83\">van Schaik et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gruber et al., 2012b</a>)."

The estimated daily travel effort for bonobos (2.6 km, <a href=\"#bib20\">Furuichi et al. (2008)</a>) is comparable with some chimpanzee communities, incidentally the ones with the smallest tool repertoires for the species (Kanyawara, Ngogo and Sonso, all in Uganda), underlining a possible convergence in ecological pressures faced by these populations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gruber et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, some convergence can also be found with modern humans. For instance, modern human hunter-gatherers walk on average 11.4\u201314.1 km/day (<a href=\"#bib47\">Marlowe, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Pontzer et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib59\">2016</a>) and have the most diverse tool repertoire of all Hominidae, much beyond anything reported from the great apes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Marlowe, 2010</a>).

By extension, our results have direct implications for understanding hominid technological evolution, particularly in relation to the evolution of locomotor behaviour in the early stages of human evolution, as hominids faced similar ecological pressures. In effect, a number of major biogeographic events in the human lineage occurred at times of climate instability and it has been suggested that the development of tool use and sociality in hominins could constitute adaptive responses to heightened habitat instability (<a href=\"#bib64\">Potts, 2013</a>). Australopithecines, for instance, evolved in a changing environment at the beginning of the Pliocene, where they faced more patchy resources of potentially lower quality (<a href=\"#bib14\">Foley and Gamble, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Potts, 2013</a>). Our findings support the view that tool use is connected to energy gain in a changing environment and that using tools is a response to increased costs of travel and lower quality of available food. In parallel, the adoption of bipedalism, which is less energetically costly than the quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion of chimpanzees, also allowed minimizing energy expenditure (<a href=\"#bib60\">Pontzer et al., 2009</a>). Efficient, human-like bipedalism and tool use may have had complementary effects on travel costs, allowing both energy gain through the exploitation of novel ecological niches and energy economy during locomotion. Whether their development to unrivalled levels is what led to the dispersal of early humans throughout Africa and the advent of complex technology around 3.0 million years ago (<a href=\"#bib14\">Foley and Gamble, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Harmand et al., 2015</a>) remains to be investigated."

Honey acquisition does not involve any tool use and is carried out with limited success only (T. Gruber, personal observation). In our honey-trap experiment, we provided subjects with the opportunity to systematically engage with a foraging problem, a 16\u00a0cm deep hole drilled into a 50\u00a0cm long log of about 25\u00a0cm diameter. The honey-trap experiment, by closely mimicking a natural setting, has proven its ecological validity, with over 80 individuals in two unhabituated and two habituated communities engaging with the experiment (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gruber et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2012a</a>). The hole contained natural honey up to about 10\u00a0cm below the surface, which could only be extracted with the help of a suitable tool (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gruber et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2011</a>). Honeycombs were positioned so that they covered the hole to prevent insects, such as bees and ants, from entering it. Finally, a stick was potentially placed next to the log or directly plugged into the honey, depending on the experimental condition (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gruber et al., 2011</a>). The apparatus was only set up when no chimpanzees were around and the experimenter (TG) always left the experimental area before the arrival of a subject. Several such apparatuses were in operation throughout the study period, all of them positioned at different locations throughout the Sonso territory. We never limited access to the apparatus, so that several individuals could participate during a given experimental day, possibly simultaneously."

In 124 cases of 292 (42.5%), the tested subjects were strictly alone while in 86 cases of 292 (29.5%) we tested individuals within a family unit. Finally, in 82 cases out of 292 (28%), other individuals joined the tested subject and also engaged with the honey-trap. These trials were also counted as engagement with the apparatus if the individual attempted to recover the honey (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Experimental days were spread over six years (between 2009-2010 and 2012-2015, about 19 experimental days per year), with several weeks without experiment between each set of trials. Engagement time was defined as the time spent by a subject actively seeking to recover honey from the apparatus. Any attempt at playing with the log, or simply resting on the log was not included. In total, we observed 21 distinct tool use occurrences by 11 individuals: six in the alone context, seven in the family unit context and eight in the social context. For three of the latter trials, this occurred during social trials when other individuals had been using a tool before them. Because it has been shown that chimpanzee sponging is influenced socially (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hobaiter et al., 2014</a>), we cannot exclude that these individuals may have been influenced by the previous individual engaging with the log. However, it is also possible that chimpanzees opted for a tool solution independently in each of these cases (see discussion in <a href=\"#bib29\">Gruber (2016)</a>). For this reason, we considered each of the 21 instances independent from each other."

Over the last decades, Budongo Forest has been described as a rich environment where chimpanzees do not face periods of food scarcity comparable to the ones experienced by other chimpanzee populations (<a href=\"#bib56\">Newton-Fisher, 1999</a>). For instance, a study conducted during this period found that there was no positive relationship between food availability and party size, a marker of food scarcity (<a href=\"#bib55\">Newton-Fisher et al., 2000</a>). Nevertheless, recent research has shown that the food supply has steadily decreased in Budongo Forest, suggesting the possible appearance of periods of food scarcity for the resident primate populations (<a href=\"#bib3\">Babweteera et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, when correlating party size with proportion of ripe fruit feeding over the whole duration of our study, we found an overall relationship close to 0, reflecting the results of the earlier study by <a href=\"#bib55\">Newton-Fisher et al., (2000)</a>. However, we saw a\u00a0large variation between years, with years (2009, 2013, 2014) where the relationship follows the more conventional chimpanzee pattern (i.e. more ripe fruit feeding coincides with larger parties), years (2010, 2011) where this pattern follows an opposite direction, and years (2008, 2012) where there is no clear pattern (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Additionally, even within a particular year, we observed substantial variation in monthly ripe fruit consumption (range: 0.00 to 0.93, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Similarly, there was also large variation in time spent feeding on fig species across the duration of our study (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), with fig species often considered a fallback food for chimpanzees, and their consumption a potential marker of food scarcity (<a href=\"#bib48\">Marshall and Wrangham, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Harrison and Marshall, 2011</a>). Our experiments, spread across this spectrum, thus allowed us to test the potential effect of food scarcity and travel effort across a large range of ecological situations."

Data for dependent juvenile individuals are extracted from their mother's behaviour.

This approach is justified given an analysis of a subset of our data for which the activity for all party members (in addition to the focal individual) was recorded. Across 31,278 party scans, the mean proportion of individuals that expressed the same behaviour as the party\u2019s focal individual was 0.8 (median\u00a0=\u00a01.0, range: 0.0\u20131.0)."

We then noted the respective focal animal\u2019s activity and plant part eaten. In other words, we considered the focal animal as representative for the experimental subject as long as they were part of the same party. Because juveniles who engaged with the experiments were still dependent to their mother at the time of the experiment (and therefore are not considered as individual points in the database), we extracted these data from their mother's data.

Because we had no a priori expectation as to what time period was meaningful to the chimpanzees, we considered different time periods, ranging from one week prior to the experiment up to 13 weeks before the experiment (i.e. approximately three months), using one-week increments. Note that we did this in a cumulative fashion, i.e. a given 2-week data point included the data of the first week before an experiment, a given 3-week data point included data from weeks 1 and 2, and so forth. We controlled for this inter-dependence statistically (see below). In this way, we assembled a total of 292\u00d713\u00a0=\u00a03,796 data points.

There were no influential individuals with respect to the significance of the full model, i.e. our model was stable with respect to our entire set of predictor variables significantly explaining how much time individuals spent engaging with the honey experiment. However, this analysis also indicated one individual having been disproportionately influential, such that with this subject excluded from the data set the 3-way interaction was not statistically significant anymore. After removing the 3-way interaction (ripe fruit feeding\u00a0: travel time\u00a0: time period) and the two 2-way interactions including time period (i.e. time period\u00a0: ripe fruit feeding and time period\u00a0: travel time, assessed with likelihood ratio tests resulting in p&gt;0.05), only the interaction between ripe fruit feeding and travel time remained significant. Note that the model with this individual excluded was still significantly different from its respective null model. The resulting effect of the ripe fruit feeding\u00a0: travel time interaction resembles mostly what we found at short time periods of our full model (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This suggests that we may have overestimated the effect of time period in our main analysis, but also suggests that the interaction between ripe fruit feeding and travel time is robust as far as influential individuals are concerned, which corroborates our main finding, i.e. that the time subjects engaged with the honey experiment was explained by the interaction of ripe fruit feeding and travel time."

Initially, we attempted to fit an equivalent model as for the engagement time analysis. However, this model did not converge, presumably because tool use was generally rare and our model was therefore too complex. Instead, we fitted three separate models at time periods of 1, 7, and 13 weeks, i.e., we excluded time period as predictor variable. In addition to subject age and sex, we included the 2-way interaction between ripe fruit feeding and travel time (as in the engagement model), and fitted engagement time as an offset term (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fox and Weisberg, 2011</a>). Subject ID and experiment ID were added as random intercepts. All numeric predictor variables were transformed (square root or log) and subsequently standardized to mean\u00a0=\u00a00 and SD\u00a0=\u00a01. As for the engagement model, we first assessed the significance of the three full models (comprising all predictor terms, including the two-way interaction) versus the corresponding three null models (only comprising the random effects and the auto-correlation term) with likelihood ratio tests. Only if such a comparison revealed statistical significance did we explore the full model. To do so, we assessed the significance of the interaction term, which we removed if not\u00a0significant (at alpha\u00a0=\u00a00.05) to allow interpretation of main effects (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hector et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Mundry, 2011</a>)."

We checked for influential individuals in the same manner as described above, though only for the 1-week model. With regards to the\u00a0significance of the full model, we found that in seven cases (i.e. seven different individuals), the likelihood ratio test for the comparison of the full against the null model revealed <i>p</i>-values larger than 0.1. Out of these seven overly influential individuals, six were individuals that were observed as having used tools at least once. Given that the overall number of tool uses was small (21 cases) compared to the total number of cases (N\u00a0=\u00a0292) it is not surprising that excluding individuals that contributed to the number of tool uses pulls the model substantially towards the null model, i.e. tool use was random. However, in all models the parameter estimates for travel time were positive (mean\u00a0=\u00a00.38, range: 0.25 \u2212 0.61), while all estimates for ripe fruit feeding were negative (mean\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.29, range: \u22120.38 \u2013 \u22120.13), which is consistent with our finding that tool use was driven in separate directions by ripe fruit feeding and travel time, though the actual magnitude of these effects remains to be further investigated."

When possible, we used fruit consumption and travel data from the same study, as this would directly connect the travel effort with the food consumed at the time of the study. When this was not possible, we extracted or calculated the values from the literature. If there were more than one value for any of the variables, we selected the values that had been estimated the closest to each other. For tool use, we only took into account feeding-related tool use behaviour, as reviewed by <a href=\"#bib75\">Sanz and Morgan (2007)</a>. We used estimates of travel in activity budget and proportion of fruits in the diet to compare with our experimental data. We calculated non-parametric (Spearman) correlations between these values and the number of different tools used in the respective communities. We also ran an additional correlation between number of tools and daily travelled distance when these data were available."

While travel will have some inherent energy cost, chimpanzees may be more active when food is more plentiful, and may be more likely to pursue attractive but less energy-rich foods when food energy is plentiful. For example, it has been suggested that chimps hunt more often when food availability and group sizes are high. Recent work from Tai forest (Riedel 2011) finds that high ranking females are more gregarious, eat a higher quality diet, and travel further than low ranking females. These studies suggest that high investment in travel is not necessarily a marker of energetic need. Similarly, because of the ecology of the Sonso community, it is not necessarily clear that the% of time spent feeding on ripe fruit is necessarily indicative of energetic need. In fact, if fruit is abundant, it may take individuals less time to meet their energetic needs. Demonstrating an increase in the amount of time spent feeding on fallback foods would provide more convincing evidence of energetic stress. Basically, you need to convince the reader that your proxies for energetic need are valid."

First, we have expanded our discussion of the relative profitability hypothesis (Discussion, third paragraph). We propose that if travel effort can indeed be considered an extra energetic cost, it may constitute an appropriate trigger to the switch from a non-tool-using strategy to a tool-using strategy. This switch occurs at a time when the primary non-tool-using strategy (non-tool-using fruit foraging) is not providing an optimal response to the energetic needs of individuals. Additionally, the relative profitability hypothesis is also supported by the fact that some individuals (the tool-users) will gain an advantage compared to the non-tool-users, because they can exploit a resource that others cannot (in the aforementioned paragraph)."

Additionally, we discuss shortly the cognitive demands associated with the innovation hypothesis as originally defined by Fox et al. (1999), although we do not expand too much on this question as it was already the focus of other publications (in the aforementioned paragraph)."

Similarly, the possible innovation or learning of tool use during the experiment cannot be decisively attributed to the social opportunities that allowed an individual to access the apparatus, or to observe others engaging with the apparatus using a tool (in the aforementioned paragraph). Here, a different study focused on the spread of a novel behaviour, moss-sponging, in the Sonso community (Hobaiter et al. 2014) allow us to expand over social opportunities to learn novel tool use behaviour (in the aforementioned paragraph)."

In essence, while opportunities to face a particular ecological problem are mandatory to trigger the use of tools, they have to be considered through a larger scope taking into account the current needs of an individual, also integral to the probability of developing tool use. As such, one must take into account whether it is relatively more profitable for the animal to exploit this resource with a tool, in comparison with non-tool-using options. The non-tool-using options, possibly less costly, can prevail for both potential innovators and learners if there are no major incentives to develop a novel behaviour (in the aforementioned paragraph)."

Because our goal was to analyse the test subject\u2019s behaviour over a long period (up to 13 weeks) before an experimental trial, we sought the best way to accurately represent its behaviour across this time. While using the individual focal data would have been the most accurate, it was also limiting the scope of our analysis. As there were around 70 individuals in the Sonso community at the time of the experiments, the likelihood that a test subject would be followed in the days preceding an experimental trial depended on the duration considered: the longer the time period considered was, the more chances there were to find a focal day of this individual in this time period. However, this would restrain the possible number of cases analysed. An alternative method is to take advantage of the fact that chimpanzees that are part of the same parties, from which a focal individual is chosen, typically engage in the same activity as the focal. In effect, we found that the activity of members of a party was identical to the one of the focal individual in 80% of 31,278 scans. We concluded that this method could both provide a larger dataset to analyse, as well as give an accurate picture of how the test subject had behaved during the preceding weeks of the experiment. We now clarify this approach in the Results (first paragraph) and provide additional details on this analysis in the Methods (subsection \u201cObservational data\u201d, first paragraph)."

While our set-up aimed to test experimental subjects when they were alone, we could not prevent them from being joined by other individuals in some cases. This is because the experimenter could not intervene in anyway once a given individual had found the honey-trap apparatus and started engaging with it to ensure that no chimpanzee would be able to connect the honey provided with humans, a point of crucial importance in the context of field experiments. Additionally, to test mothers with dependent offspring, or the offspring themselves, we could only aim for particular family units, as they would always remain together. As a consequence, our dataset consists of trials recorded alone, in familial or social settings. We recorded a total of 124 cases out of 292 (42.5%) where the tested subjects were strictly alone and 86 cases out of 292 (29.5%) where we tested individuals within a family unit (a total of 72%). Finally, in 82 cases out of 292 (28%), other individuals joined the experimental subject in the course of the experiment and also engaged with the honey-trap experiment. We have rewritten the original sentence to avoid confusion (Introduction, eighth paragraph). We have also added information about the social context of the experiment in the Methods and provide a new figure (subsection \u201cThe \u2018honey-trap\u2019 experiment\u201d, second paragraph and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Regarding tool use, 6 instances of tool use occurred in the alone setting, 7 in the family setting, and 8 in the social setting, including 3 when another test subject had previously used a tool. However, because it is unclear whether individuals influenced each other in using tools (discussed in Gruber, 2016), we consider these data points as independent. We have modified the original text (in the aforementioned paragraph)."

We are aware of the particular ecology of Budongo Forest, which has for long been considered as preventing food scarcity for its resident chimpanzee population, as shown by Newton-Fisher (1999). Nevertheless, more recent studies have shown that the food offer in Budongo Forest has largely decreased over the last decade, in part due to anthropogenic activities in and adjacent to the forest (Babweteera et al. 2012; Reynolds et al., 2015). As such, Budongo Forest may not have offered the same stable food supply during our study as it used to do in the 1990s. We illustrate this point in the Methods (subsection \u201cInfluence of seasonality and identification of periods of food scarcity in Budongo Forest\u201d) and discuss it in the Discussion (second paragraph)."

It is unclear to us how \u201ctrue\u201d periods of food scarcity can be defined across communities: a savanna chimpanzee faces very different ecological conditions compared to a Sonso chimpanzee but both will certainly face fluctuations in food availability over time. As we now stress in the Introduction, echoing Sanz &amp; Morgan (2013), it is unclear at which point this variation may constitute a real scarcity (Introduction, fifth paragraph). Our analysis is designed to allow testing periods where food supply is relatively less compared to other periods where food is relatively abundant. In fact, taking this temporal variation into account (via our analysis design) is of crucial importance to understand interactions with the apparatus. In this sense, by introducing two new figures, we wish to highlight temporal variation not only in feeding behaviour (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>), but also in the relationship between feeding behaviour and travel time and party size (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>)."

We also see extensive variation with respect to the mentioned relationship between ripe fruit consumption and party size, with the full extent of possible situations: in some years, party size correlates with ripe fruit feeding (2009, 2013 and 2014), suggesting the possible visible effect of food scarcity usually outlined by other studies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). However, although smaller party sizes have been taken as evidence of food scarcity, this correlation is not found in all chimpanzee field sites. For instance, in a recent study at Goualougo, researchers found that party sizes remained relatively stable across the year while food availability itself was not (Sanz &amp; Morgan 2013). We also found this pattern for some years (2008, 2012), or even a negative relationship between party size and ripe fruit feeding (2010, 2011, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This suggests that our data encompass a large range of possible cases and therefore, that they are well suited to test the effect of the variation of food offer and travel on tool use. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> thus now highlight that the experiment was conducted taking into account this variation. We also wish to point out that absence of problematic collinearity in our model does not indicate that a relationship between any two predictor variables is exactly zero. In fact, in Sonso, we find that the relationship between ripe fruit feeding and travel time varies dramatically within and between years (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

While travel will have some inherent energy cost, chimpanzees may be more active when food is more plentiful, and may be more likely to pursue attractive but less energy-rich foods when food energy is plentiful. For example, it has been suggested that chimps hunt more often when food availability and group sizes are high. Recent work from Tai forest (Riedel 2011) finds that high ranking females are more gregarious, eat a higher quality diet, and travel further than low ranking females. These studies suggest that high investment in travel is not necessarily a marker of energetic need. Similarly, because of the ecology of the Sonso community, it is not necessarily clear that the% of time spent feeding on ripe fruit is necessarily indicative of energetic need. In fact, if fruit is abundant, it may take individuals less time to meet their energetic needs. Demonstrating an increase in the amount of time spent feeding on fallback foods would provide more convincing evidence of energetic stress. Basically, you need to convince the reader that your proxies for energetic need are valid.</i> "

                    "text": "We agree with the reviewers that longer travel times are not necessarily evidence of energy stress. While studies have shown convincingly that terrestrial travel in chimpanzees is costly compared to other activities (e.g. Pontzer et al. 2014), the examples provided by the reviewers show that longer travels are not necessarily markers of energy stress, as long energy balance remains positive. Indeed, if walking costs are compensated by the possibility of fulfilling one\u2019s normal energetic costs or by reaching a high-praised food reward through travel, there is no reason to assume that travel is a necessarily costly activity. The example of high ranking females at Tai illustrates this: the high ranking females are more gregarious, support each other, and can easily monopolize the best food resources, which will fulfil their energetic needs (see Discussion, second paragraph). Similarly, being assured that they will fulfil their energetic needs for the day independently of whether there will be a catch at the end or not, allows chimpanzees to invest energy into hunting, an activity that can be costly both in terms of energy and safety, but that can bring strong social and political effects."

Our analyses show that it is a combination of both low food availability and extended travel that lead chimpanzees to engage more with the apparatus, not only one factor. When the food availability was high or travel time short, there was no incentive to engage with the apparatus. In fact, in situations where time devoted to travel was particularly short, the engagement with the apparatus was the lowest (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Conversely, when food was readily available and within a short distance, investigating the apparatus while not necessarily being able to reach the honey may reveal itself less profitable than heading straight for the available food (Discussion, first three paragraphs)."

                    "text": "Secondly, as already pointed out above in response to point 4), the ecology of Budongo Forest, while possibly less likely to expose its resident primate populations to long periods of food scarcity, has nevertheless changed over the last decades (Babweteera et al. 2012). Relying on an analysis of fallback foods to identify periods of food scarcity in Budongo Forest may however be difficult considering that the diet of the Sonso chimpanzees is mainly constituted of Figs (Newton-Fisher, 1999), which are commonly seen as fallback resources (Marshall &amp; Wrangham 2007, Harrison &amp; Marshall 2011). Nevertheless, we now provide two additional panels (B) and (C) to <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> (formerly <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) to illustrate the variation in ripe fruit feeding and fig feeding in Sonso over the period during which our experiments and observations were carried out. Similar to panel (A), which illustrates seasonality during this period, these two new panels show that our experimental months encompassed a large variation, from months where fruit, respectively fig, consumption was lower than average, to months when fruit, respectively fig, consumption was higher than average. If, figs are considered a fallback food as in other chimpanzee communities, months with higher fig consumption in Sonso can qualify as periods of scarcity. Nevertheless, we would like to stress again that the main goal of our study was to study the influence of a whole range of possible ecological conditions that could influence tool use, and not only periods of possible food scarcity (subsection \u201cInfluence of seasonality and identification of periods of food scarcity in Budongo Forest\u201d). As such, we were most interested in variation in food availability. As shown in our updated <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, chimpanzee ripe fruit consumption is characterized by its large variability, ranging monthly from 0.0 to 93.3% of their diet. The effects of this relative abundance and large variability suggest that a combination of both low food availability and high travel to reach it, arguably a good indicator of relative food scarcity in the forest, explains best engagement with the honey-trap experiment."
