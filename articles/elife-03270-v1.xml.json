However, the significance of increased pHi for cancer <i>in vivo</i> remains unresolved. Using <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we show that increased pHi is sufficient to induce dysplasia in the absence of other transforming cues and potentiates growth and invasion with oncogenic Ras. Using a genetically encoded biosensor we also confirm increased pHi <i>in situ</i>. Moreover, in <i>Drosophila</i> models and clonal human mammary cells we show that limiting H<sup>+</sup> efflux with oncogenic Raf or Ras induces acidosis and synthetic lethality. Further, we show lethality in invasive, primary tumor cell lines with inhibiting H<sup>+</sup> efflux. Synthetic lethality with reduced H<sup>+</sup> efflux and activated oncogene expression could be exploited therapeutically to restrain cancer progression while limiting off-target effects."
