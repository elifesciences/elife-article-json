However, cells frequently experience unexpected environmental perturbations that might induce phenotypic switching. How cells maintain phenotypic states in the face of environmental fluctuations remains an open question. Here, we use environmental perturbations to characterize the resilience of phenotypic states in a synthetic gene network near a critical transition. We find that far from the critical transition an environmental perturbation may induce little to no phenotypic switching, whereas close to the critical transition the same perturbation can cause many cells to switch phenotypic states. This loss of resilience was observed for perturbations that interact directly with the gene circuit as well as for a variety of generic perturbations-such as salt, ethanol, or temperature shocks-that alter the state of the cell more broadly. We obtain qualitatively similar findings in natural gene circuits, such as the yeast GAL network. Our findings illustrate how phenotypic memory can become destabilized by environmental variability near a critical transition."

Several well-studied natural gene networks can be found in multiple phenotypic states depending on the history that the cells have experienced, notably including the yeast galactose utilization network and sporulation commitment in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acar et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Igoshin et al., 2006</a>). Additionally, synthetic biology aims to create de novo phenotypic memory storage devices, which could be used in applications such as tracking dynamics of the gut microbiome (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ajo-Franklin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kotula et al., 2014</a>). In spite of the importance of phenotypic memory in natural and synthetic gene circuits, little is known about how environmental perturbations might disrupt a cell's ability to stably adopt a specific phenotype."

A phenomenon that may be especially relevant to cellular memory is that complex systems near a critical transition experience a loss of resilience of their stable states to external perturbations (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dai et al., 2012</a>). In particular, a system far from a critical transition may return to its original state following a perturbation, whereas closer to the critical transition the same environmental perturbation may cause the system to switch to an alternative stable state (e.g., collapse of a population [<a href=\"#bib9\">Dai et al., 2012</a>]). The dynamics in the vicinity of the critical point are very slow on both sides of the critical point. Therefore, it is worth noting that a short lived perturbation that pushes the system past the critical point may also not cause switching if the perturbation is short enough, if it pushes it to a position that is close to the critical point, or both. This aforementioned loss of resilience near a critical transition results from a shrinking basin of attraction in the stability landscape (<a href=\"#bib23\">Scheffer et al., 2009</a>). In the context of a gene network, this loss of resilience would manifest as an increasing sensitivity of phenotypic memory against environmental perturbations approaching the environmental condition in which cells would (deterministically) switch to a different phenotype. Our initial goal was to observe memory in a model gene circuit and then characterize the resilience of the phenotypic state against perturbations in the extracellular environment."

This toggle switch is composed of two mutually inhibitory transcription factors, LacI and TetR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To enable tracking of the state of the cell, different color fluorescent proteins are expressed depending upon which of these transcriptional factors is highly expressed (mCherry and eGFP, hereafter referred to as \u2018RFP\u2019 and \u2018GFP\u2019). As external knobs to control the state of the cell, the inducer IPTG modulates the strength of repression of LacI, whereas ATc modulates the strength of repression of TetR."

A separate population of cells was pre-grown in ATc to initialize the cells in a high RFP state. We then transferred the populations to a range of ATc concentrations and monitored the dynamics over several days using flow cytometry. All cultures were grown with a fixed concentration of IPTG (40 \u03bcM), which served as an orthogonal control variable for later experiments. For high and low concentrations of ATc, cells converged to a state that was independent of the history they were pre-grown in (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). However, for intermediate concentrations of ATc there was little to no switching of the phenotypic state of the cells even after 260 hr of growth and over 80 cell divisions. The mutual repression in this toggle switch therefore indeed allows for remarkably stable cellular memory for intermediate ATc concentrations. As expected (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acar et al., 2005</a>), the lifetime of the states decreases approaching the critical transition at which switching is deterministic (hereafter, we refer to this point as the \u2018critical transition\u2019 or \u2018phenotypic switch\u2019), although interestingly we observe non-exponential switching kinetics, potentially indicating the presence of metastable states in the gene network (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). This decrease in lifetime is one manifestation of deteriorating cellular memory approaching the critical transition, but it is not obvious whether in ATc concentrations with long lifetimes (i.e., strong memory) the cells are also able to retain their memory in the face of environmental perturbations."

This expectation arises because the state's basin of attraction shrinks as the stable and unstable fixed points approach one another (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Brief environmental perturbations will push the system out of equilibrium. If the system is far from the critical transition it will return to its original state after the perturbation is removed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, close to the critical transition, the same perturbation might cause the system to cross the basin boundary, thus causing the cell to switch phenotypic states. Therefore, phenotypic states are expected to lose resilience to environmental perturbations near a critical transition."

We then transferred the populations to multiple ATc concentrations for 4 days, leaving the cells in the high GFP state but at varying distances from the critical transition. At the end of the fourth day, the cells were then perturbed by decreasing the concentration of IPTG for 1 day before returning the IPTG concentration to its original value. Far from the critical transition (2 ng/ml ATc), the IPTG perturbation caused almost no cells to switch their phenotypic state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, close to the critical transition (8 ng/ml ATc), the perturbation caused a great majority of the cells to switch into a high RFP state. Even after the perturbation was removed and the initial conditions were restored, many cells remained in a high RFP state. As expected, the severity of the environmental perturbation (i.e., the magnitude of reduction in IPTG) correlated with the fraction of cells that switched states in response to the perturbation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Importantly, there was negligible switching (\u223c0.5%) into the high RFP state for control cells grown in constant IPTG concentrations, demonstrating that the phenotypic switching was indeed caused by the perturbation. Moreover, the lack of phenotypic switching in the absence of the perturbation also indicates that in all of these conditions the traditional measure of cellular memory\u2014the lifetime of the state\u2014would classify all of these conditions as being stable with a high degree of cellular memory. Similar results were observed in the other direction, as cells pre-grown in the RFP state approach the critical transition associated with sudden switching to the GFP state (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Given this, we wanted to explore whether memory in the toggle switch would lose resilience against generic perturbations approaching a critical transition. Cells from a high GFP history at different distances from the phenotypic switch (2, 4, and 8 ng/ml ATc) were perturbed in several different ways for 24 hr: heat stress, osmotic stress with sodium chloride, ethanol stress, and a glucose pulse. Remarkably, we observed a loss of resilience against all four of these generic perturbations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Far from the critical transition (2 ng/ml ATc), there was little to no phenotypic switching in response to any of these \u2018generic\u2019 perturbations. However, close to the critical transition (8 ng/ml ATc) we observed nearly complete switching in all perturbations, despite the fact that there was essentially no switching (\u223c0.5%) in the absence of the perturbations. At a given distance from the phenotypic switch, increasing the strength of a generic perturbation increased the probability that cells would switch into the alternative state (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The switching induced by the glucose perturbation can perhaps be understood by the fact that glucose shuts down expression of the entire system (LacI, TetR, GFP, and RFP) via catabolite repression of a GAL1 upstream activation sequence, thus pushing the cells toward a low GFP and low RFP state (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gardner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ellis et al., 2009</a>). The other three perturbations have much broader effects on the cell with no obvious connection to the toggle switch network being probed in our experiments. Cellular memory can therefore degrade near a critical transition for a wide range of different environmental perturbations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

However, the effect of a salt shock or a heat shock on the GFP output of the toggle switch is challenging to predict a priori. Notably, it is possible that some generic perturbations will stabilize the state of the cells and reduce their probability of switching. Indeed, we found that none of the four generic perturbations led to a loss of resilience in the transition from the high RFP state (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This result is unsurprising given that the perturbations did not strongly push the genetic network toward the high GFP state (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). For the salt, ethanol, and heat stresses, the perturbation increased the RFP output of the cells, thereby stabilizing the state. Thus, phenotypic states in the toggle switch only loss resilience to perturbations that push the system toward the alternative state."

To test this hypothesis, we used our perturbation experiments to estimate the location of the basin boundary in GFP-RFP space and see how it shifted for different concentrations of ATc (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). For a given concentration of ATc and a chosen perturbation, we measured the fraction of cells that switched into the alternative state at the end of the recovery period. Analysis of the GFP-RFP distribution at the end of the perturbation and before the recovery period revealed that many cells were in an indeterminate state between the two stable phenotypic states. We ranked the cells according to the ratio of GFP expression to RFP expression and assumed that a cell would switch phenotypic states when its ratio of GFP expression to RFP expression fell below a critical threshold. This is equivalent to assuming that the basin boundary between the two phenotypic states takes the form of a line on a log\u2013log plot. To justify this assumption, we used a simple mathematical model of the toggle switch (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Our modeling indicated that this assumption would hold as long as the promoter strengths of the two transcription factors in the toggle switch were approximately equal."

For example, one might expect that the mean GFP of cells in the high GFP state would decrease with increasing ATc, thus potentially signaling that the critical transition is approaching (<a href=\"#bib18\">Isaacs et al., 2003</a>). However, we find that the mean GFP of unswitched cells is approximately constant over the range of ATc concentrations in which we observe a loss of resilience (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

This loss of stability would manifest in our experiments as an increase in the variation of GFP fluorescence among the population of (unswitched) cells. However, we find experimentally that there is no increase in variation within the population approaching the critical transition, even very close to the transition where the GFP state is metastable (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>).

However, the wild-type GAL network exhibits only weak memory (<a href=\"#bib24\">Song et al., 2010</a>). To expand the range of galactose concentrations for which the system has memory (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acar et al., 2005</a>), we used a strain of yeast constitutively expressing the repressor GAL80 (which codes for a transcriptional repressor involved in one of the many feedback loops that stabilize memory in this network). To assess the state of the network, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) expression was driven by a GAL1 promoter. Cells were pre-grown in high galactose (GAL ON) and then grown for a day in a range of galactose concentrations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We then examined the resilience of the GAL network to perturbations at different distances from its critical transition, similar to our experiments with the toggle switch. For the GAL network, a glucose pulse served as a directional perturbation (due to catabolite repression [<a href=\"#bib12\">Gancedo, 1998</a>]), and we again used heat, salt, and ethanol as generic perturbations. We found that the \u2018GAL ON\u2019 phenotypic state lost resilience to glucose and ethanol perturbations but not salt or heat (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Similarly, we performed experiments probing the resilience of the ON state in the <i>Escherichia coli</i> lac operon, where we again observed a loss of resilience to both directional perturbations and to the generic perturbation ethanol (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These three genetic switches have widely different architectures, and operate in two different species. Our results thus indicate that a loss of resilience approaching a phenotypic switch could be a general property of multistable gene networks and that \u2018generic\u2019 or global perturbations, such as temperature or salt shocks, can cause widespread loss of cellular memory."

We argue that this loss of resilience to perturbations near the bifurcation can be explained by a shrinking of the basin of attraction of the phenotypic state. By observing the GFP-RFP distribution at the end of the perturbation period and applying a simple threshold, we were able to accurately predict the fraction of cells that would return to the pre-perturbation memory state at the end of the recovery period. At a given distance from the bifurcation, the same basin boundary was able to accurately predict the switching fraction in response to eight different perturbations. The predictive success of this threshold is particularly impressive given that the different perturbations have dramatically different effects on the GFP-RFP distribution (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

Part of the answer is certainly that the perturbations cause a shift in the stability landscape underlying the phenotypic states. It is also possible that the perturbations cause an increase in noisy gene expression. Understanding what is occurring during the perturbation period, both biochemically and from a dynamical systems perspective, will be an area of investigation for future research."

It is interesting to ask whether we would have seen similar results if we had perturbed the system for a shorter duration. To address this question, we performed Gillespie simulations using a very simple phenomenological model of the toggle switch (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Source code 1</a>). Similar to our test tube experiments, we initialized the system in a high Lac state. The system was allowed to equilibrate for several generations, before we suddenly changed one of the parameters of the system (either the disassociation constant between the transcription factor and the DNA or the promoter strength). We performed this perturbation for a variable duration ranging from 0.2 generations to 20 generations. The system was then allowed to recover (by restoring the parameter to its initial value) for several generations, and we then determined what fraction of cells remained in a high Lac state. Two key observations emerged. (1) The degree of switching is set by both the intensity and duration of the perturbation. For dramatic perturbations, the minimum duration of perturbation to induce switching is approximately set by the cell division time (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). (2) Not all perturbations induced phenotypic switching. Of note, perturbations which stabilized the high Lac state induced negligible switching into the high Tet state (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These observations held regardless of whether the perturbation was achieved by changing the disassociation constant or the promoter strength."

Here we have demonstrated that for robust cellular memory in natural contexts subject to environmental noise, low rates of stochastic switching from the phenotypic state is not sufficient. This is because the cellular memory must also be robust against environmental fluctuations and perturbations that are impossible to avoid. Here we found experimentally that several phenotypic states lost resilience to multiple environmental perturbations near a critical transition. Given that over time there will often be multiple kinds of environmental fluctuations and perturbations, our results argue that many forms of cellular memory will become destabilized near a critical transition. Our results provide a roadmap for exploring cellular memory and phenotypic switching in other contexts, from development to cancer progression."

We would argue that this may qualify as a \u201cdesign principle\u201d that will be relevant for many different network architectures. The main takeaway from our work is that simply having a long lifetime (the traditional metric for memory in bistable gene networks) may be insufficient to ensure high-fidelity memory storage. This is because systems poised near a bifurcation could be highly sensitive to extracellular perturbations, which could abolish the memory of previous stimuli. Thus, high-fidelity memory in bistable gene circuits requires <i>both</i> a long lifetime <i>and</i> being far from a bifurcation. We believe that this conclusion is likely general and is relevant across a range of different specific implementations of cellular memory."

This study focuses on the dynamics of gene regulatory networks, which involve the interactions of proteins and DNA at the nanometer length scale, which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the phenomena that we previously studied. Moreover, the network of interactions in these two cases was very different. For these reasons, we do not believe that it is obvious which aspects of the phenomena will be the same or different between these systems. Indeed, we were quite surprised to find a lack of early warning indicators of the impending bifurcation (and we spent several months searching for them!). This highlights the point that complex dynamical systems have both universal <i>and</i> system-specific properties; quantitative experiments probing these different systems are therefore in our opinion essential."
