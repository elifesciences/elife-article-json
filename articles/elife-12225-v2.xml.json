However, the chemical mediators crucial to this process have not been fully elucidated. We reveal that a subset of NTS neurons containing cholecystokinin (CCK<sup>NTS</sup>) is responsive to nutritional state and that their activation reduces appetite and body weight in mice. Cell-specific anterograde tracing revealed that CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons provide a distinctive innervation of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), with fibers and varicosities in close apposition to a subset of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R<sup>PVH</sup>) cells, which are also responsive to CCK. Optogenetic activation of CCK<sup>NTS</sup> axon terminals within the PVH reveal the satiating function of CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons to be mediated by a CCK<sup>NTS</sup>\u2192PVH pathway that also encodes positive valence. These data identify the functional significance of CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons and reveal a sufficient and discrete NTS to hypothalamus circuit controlling appetite."

However, the chemical mediators crucial to this process have not been fully elucidated. We reveal that a subset of NTS neurons containing cholecystokinin (CCK<sup>NTS</sup>) is responsive to nutritional state and that their activation reduces appetite and body weight in mice. Cell-specific anterograde tracing revealed that CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons provide a distinctive innervation of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), with fibers and varicosities in close apposition to a subset of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R<sup>PVH</sup>) cells, which are also responsive to CCK. Optogenetic activation of CCK<sup>NTS</sup> axon terminals within the PVH reveal the satiating function of CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons to be mediated by a CCK<sup>NTS</sup>\u2192PVH pathway that also encodes positive valence. These data identify the functional significance of CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons and reveal a sufficient and discrete NTS to hypothalamus circuit controlling appetite."

Common obesity is primarily a consequence of food intake beyond the body\u2019s energetic requirements, with the excess energy consequently stored as fat.

Dark cycle fasted <i>Cck<sup>YFP</sup></i> mice were intragrastrically delivered isovolumetric (0.5\u2009ml) non-nutritive water or isocaloric (1 kcal) sucrose or amino acids.

Chemogenetic activation of CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons elicited striking c-Fos-IR in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) in food-deprived mice compared with saline-treated mice (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The PVH represents a crucial hub for the brain\u2019s regulation of energy balance and integrates a diverse range of nutritionally related hormonal and synaptic inputs, including inputs from the NTS (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grill and Hayes, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Riche et al., 1990</a>). To evaluate whether CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons directly innervate the PVH, a Cre-inducible AAV vector expressing Channelrhodopsin-2-eYFP (ChR2-eYFP) was stereotaxically injected into the NTS of <i>Cck</i>-iCre mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Cre-mediated recombination of the vector led to expression of eYFP in CCK<sup>NTS</sup> cells and their projection fields (due to axonal localization of the ChR2-eYFP fusion protein), revealing robust CCK<sup>NTS</sup> \u2192 PVH innervation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), with no substantial projections at other anterior hypothalamic regions (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>).

Monitoring home-cage food intake revealed that optogenetic activation of the CCK<sup>NTS</sup>\u2192PVH circuit produced an almost complete, and reversible, suppression of spontaneous feeding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Importantly, optogenetic activation of the CCK<sup>NTS</sup>\u2192PVH pathway neither suppresses locomotor activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>) nor water consumption (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). Furthermore, real-time optogenetic stimulation of this circuit (10\u00a0ms, 30\u00a0Hz, 1\u2009s on, every 4\u2009s) significantly suppressed re-feeding in food deprived <i>Cck-</i>iCre-ChR2-eYFP<sup>NTS</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>), but not control <i>Cck-</i>iCre-eYFP<sup>NTS</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>).

We next considered whether the CCK<sup>NTS</sup>\u2192PVH circuit is associated with the induction of an aversive physiological state. The motivational valence of this circuit was assessed using a real-time place preference test (<a href=\"#bib37\">Stamatakis and Stuber, 2012</a>). We observed no place preference when <i>Cck-</i>iCre-ChR2-eYFP<sup>NTS</sup> or <i>Cck-</i>iCre-eYFP<sup>NTS</sup> controls were tested under normal energy balance conditions, an important indication that activation NTS<sup>CCK</sup>\u2192PVH efferents is not aversive (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). However, while <i>Cck-</i>iCre-eYFP<sup>NTS</sup> controls maintained no chamber preference when food deprived, calorie depleted <i>Cck-</i>iCre-ChR2-eYFP<sup>NTS</sup> mice exhibited a significant preference for the photostimulation-paired chamber (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). This behavioral response is reminiscent of that observed following direct optogenetic activation of PVH MC4R-expressing neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Garfield et al., 2015</a>). We further examined this observation using a T-shaped maze. In this test, exploration of one of the three maze\u2019s arms was paired with the photostimulation of the NTS<sup>CCK</sup>\u2192PVH efferent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Over the three testing trials <i>Cck-</i>iCre-ChR2-eYFP<sup>NTS</sup> mice, but not <i>Cck-</i>iCre-eYFP<sup>NTS</sup> controls, developed a clear preference for the photostimulation-paired arm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). Thus, when hungry and in the absence of food, mice sought out activation of the NTS<sup>CCK</sup> efferent to PVH, revealing the CCK<sup>NTS</sup>\u2192PVH circuit encodes positive valence. These data suggest that the activation of this circuit provides relief from the unpleasantness of energy deficit by mimicking a post-prandial phase."

Briefly, 5\u20138 week-old male mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine dissolved in saline (100 and 10 mg/kg, respectively; 10\u2009ml/kg). Mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments) using ear bar with head angled at about 45\u00b0. Under magnification, an incision was made at the level of the <i>cisterna magna</i> and neck muscles carefully retracted. A 33G needle was used for <i>dura</i> incision. The <i>obex</i> served as reference point for injection. Injections were performed using a glass micropipette (diameter 20\u201340\u2009\u03bcm). NTS coordinates were A/P, -0.2; M/L, \u00b10.2; D/V, -0.2 from the <i>obex</i>. Virus was delivered under air pressure using a PLI-100A Pico-Injector (Harvard Apparatus, Cambridge, UK). About 150 nl of virus/side were delivered with multiple microinjections over 4\u20135\u2009min. The pipette remained in place for a minimum of 3 min after injection. Animals were administered an analgesic (5 mg/kg Carprofen, subcoutaneously) for 2 days post-operatively and given a minimum of 14 days recovery before being used in any DREADD experiments. During this time, mice were acclimated to handling and IP injections. For optogenetic experiments, optic fibers were placed above the PVH at least 4 weeks after the NTS viral delivery to ensure labelling of distal projection sites. Based on the Franklin and Paxinos\u00a0Mouse Brain Atlas (<a href=\"#bib9\">Franklin and Paxinos, 2008</a>), the following coordinates were used for targeting optic fibers (200\u2009\u03bcm diameter core; CFMLC22U-20; Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) at the PVH (mm from Bregma): A/P, \u22120.65; M/L, \u00b1 0; D/V, \u22124.20\u2009mm. After placement of the optic fiber, mice were allowed additional 14 days post-surgical recovery, as described above. Mice were excluded from behavioral analysis if <i>post hoc</i> histological validation showed either no viral transduction or misplaced optical fibers."

Subsequently, slices were allowed to recover in \u2018recording\u2019 solution at room temperature for a minimum of 1\u00a0hr before recording. For whole-cell recordings, slices were transferred to a submerged chamber and a Slicescope upright microscope (Scientifica, Uckfield, UK) was used for infrared - differential interference contrast and fluorescence visualization of cells. During recording slices were continuously perfused at a rate of ca. 2\u2009ml/min with oxygenated \u2018recording\u2019 solution (as above) at room temperature. All pharmacological compounds were bath applied. Whole cell current-clamp recordings were performed with pipettes (3\u20137\u00a0M\u03a9 when filled with intracellular solution) made from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Aston, UK) pulled on a Zeitz DMZ micropipette puller (Zeitz Instruments GmBH, Martinsried, Germany).

While the wave of studies applying functional genetic analysis to feeding have predominately focused on canonical leptin-responsive neurons within the ARN, including NPY/AgRP and POMC-expressing cells, much less has been examined regarding the complex organization and mechanisms involving cell groups within brainstem. A gap has remained in understanding how long-term (leptin responsive) regions communicate with acute-response centers in brainstem, and the mechanisms of peripheral-to-central communication (i.e., gut-to-brain signaling) that transduce incretin response \u2013 both topics that are illuminated in this work. A long line of investigation has implicated the gut-peptidergic molecule CCK as a key regulator of satiety, and the present work provides the first analysis of the pathways involved at the genetic, molecular, and behavioral levels. Using a genetically targeted fluorescent probe, CCK expressing neurons within the NTS are identified as nutrient state dependent, being activated by gastric gavage with nutrient but not saline. Chemogentic testing reveals that activation of CCK-NTS cell bodies results in both inhibition of refeeding response to 24 h fasting, and, with chronic stimulation, weight loss that is rapidly recovered following cessation of the stimulation. Pharmacologic antagonism of CCK abrogated the effects genetic stimulation of these neurons, consistent with mediation via CCK-R signaling as the mediator of the NTS-derived stimulus. At an anatomic level, data is provided using genetically-encoded cell type-specific tracing to establish the NTS-&gt;PVN distribution track as a pathway for CCK-induced signaling, and optogenetic approaches demonstrate that activation of CCK-responsive PVN cells leads to inhibition of the homeostatic fasting-refeeding response to food deprivation through a mechanism corresponding with activation of closely juxtaposed MCR4-expressing cells on patch clamp analysis. Additional experiments indicate that effects of CCK cannot be attributed to aversive properties, consistent with the \"positive valence\" of the CCK-target PVN cells on behavioral testing. At the physiologic level, past work by these investigators and their collaborators has established a role for leptin in the tonic regulation of CCK-responsive neurons in the parabrachial nucleus, revealing cross-talk between the adipostatic hormone leptin and CCK in the counterregulatory response to glucodeprivation. That adipostatic (leptin) and satiety (CCK) signals are anatomically and physiologically integrated/convergent at the level of brainstem and PVN is now firmly established in the present work."
