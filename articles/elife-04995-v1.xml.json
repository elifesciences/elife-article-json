In this study, we aimed to test the effect of audio\u2013visual temporal coherence alone on selective listening, free of linguistic confounds. We presented listeners with competing auditory streams whose amplitude varied independently and a visual stimulus with varying radius, while manipulating the cross-modal temporal relationships. Performance improved when the auditory target's timecourse matched that of the visual stimulus. The fact that the coherence was between task-irrelevant stimulus features suggests that the observed improvement stemmed from the integration of auditory and visual streams into cross-modal objects, enabling listeners to better attend the target. These findings suggest that in everyday conditions, where listeners can often see the source of a sound, temporal cues provided by vision can help listeners to select one sound source from a mixture."

In this study, we aimed to test the effect of audio\u2013visual temporal coherence alone on selective listening, free of linguistic confounds. We presented listeners with competing auditory streams whose amplitude varied independently and a visual stimulus with varying radius, while manipulating the cross-modal temporal relationships. Performance improved when the auditory target's timecourse matched that of the visual stimulus. The fact that the coherence was between task-irrelevant stimulus features suggests that the observed improvement stemmed from the integration of auditory and visual streams into cross-modal objects, enabling listeners to better attend the target. These findings suggest that in everyday conditions, where listeners can often see the source of a sound, temporal cues provided by vision can help listeners to select one sound source from a mixture."

This process of auditory scene analysis underlies our ability to listen to one sound while ignoring others and is crucial for everyday listening. While psychophysical studies have focused on the perceptual \u2018rules\u2019 that govern the likelihood of elements being grouped into single objects in audition (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bregman, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bizley and Cohen, 2013</a>) or in vision (<a href=\"#bib27\">Marr, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lee and Yuille, 2006</a>), perception is a seamlessly multisensory process whereby sensory information is integrated both within and across different sensory modalities. It is of great interest to understand how the formation of cross-modal objects might influence perception, and in particular, whether visual information may provide additional cues that listeners can use to facilitate auditory scene segregation through the generation of auditory-visual objects. To date, there has yet to be a study utilizing ongoing, continuous stimuli that demonstrates a perceptual benefit of an uninformative visual stimulus when selectively attending to one auditory stimulus in a mixture."

Much work has focused on the role that visual information plays in contributing linguistic information\u2014for example, the unvoiced consonants /p/, /t/, and /k/ can be disambiguated based upon mouth movements, a fact which underlies the McGurk effect whereby conflicting acoustic and visual information create an intermediary percept, changing which syllable a listener hears (<a href=\"#bib29\">McGurk and MacDonald, 1976</a>).

In addition to information about when to listen, timing may be important for another reason: temporal coherence may facilitate binding of auditory and visual stimuli into single cross-modal objects. However, previous studies of audio\u2013visual binding\u2014the integration of auditory and visual stimuli into a single percept\u2014have focused on judgments of coherence or simultaneity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Recanzone, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Spence and Squire, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fujisaki and Nishida, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Denison et al., 2013</a>), rather than on the perceptual enhancements provided by that binding."

A task-irrelevant sound can also increase detection of a visual stimulus (<a href=\"#bib28\">McDonald et al., 2000</a>) by affecting the bias and sensitivity, as well as alter the perceived visual intensity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stein et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Odgaard et al., 2003</a>). Similarly, an irrelevant visual stimulus can affect the detection of an auditory stimulus (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lovelace et al., 2003</a>) as well as the perceived loudness (<a href=\"#bib34\">Odgaard et al., 2004</a>).

To achieve this, we created audio\u2013visual stimuli with dynamic, continuous noise envelopes. We chose to manipulate temporal coherence in an ethologically relevant modulation frequency range (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chandrasekaran et al., 2009</a>), amplitude modulating our stimuli with a noisy envelope low-pass filtered at 7 Hz. Listeners were asked to perform an auditory selective attention task that required them to report brief perturbations in the pitch or the timbre of one of two competing streams. Additionally, a concurrent visual stream was presented where the radius of the visual stimulus could vary coherently with the amplitude changes either of the target or the masker, or be independent of both. We hypothesized that modulating the visual stimulus coherently with one of the auditory streams would cause these stimuli to automatically bind together, with a consequent improvement in performance when the visual stimulus was coherent with the target auditory stream. Importantly, any perceptual benefit could only result from the temporal coherence between the auditory and visual stimulus, as the visual stimulus itself provided no additional information about the timing of the target auditory perturbations."

Importantly, the visual stimulus was uninformative of the auditory task, such that any behavioral benefit could be unambiguously determined to be the result of selective enhancement of an auditory stream due to binding with the visual stimulus. This cross-feature enhancement thus served simultaneously as our assay of audio\u2013visual binding (eschewing subjective judgments) and an investigation of binding's impact on auditory scene analysis."

The temporal dynamics of each stream were defined by low-pass noise envelopes with a 7 Hz cutoff frequency, roughly approximating the modulation frequency range of speech amplitude envelopes and visual mouth movements (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chandrasekaran et al., 2009</a>). In each trial of 14 s duration there were two auditory streams (one target, one masker; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) that were amplitude-modulated by independent tokens of the noise envelope and one visual stream: a gray disc surrounded by a white ring whose radius was also modulated by a noise envelope (envelope in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; images of disc in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The visual radius envelope could match the amplitude envelope of the target auditory stream (example stimuli in <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) or masker auditory stream (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), or be independent from both (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). This audio\u2013visual coherence (specifically which, if either, auditory stream's amplitude envelope was matched by the visual radius) defined the three experimental conditions, henceforth referred to as match-target, match-masker, and match-neither, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The goal of the subject was to respond by pressing a button to brief perturbation events in the target stream and ignore events in the masker stream. Importantly, the task-relevant auditory feature was not the same feature that was coherent with the visual stimulus. A response to an event in the target stream would be deemed a \u2018hit\u2019 and a response to a masker event would be deemed a \u2018false alarm\u2019, allowing us to calculate <i>d\u2032</i> sensitivity for each of the three conditions. Subjects were also required to respond to brief color change flashes in the visual stimulus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)\u2014this task was not difficult (overall hit rate was 87.7%), but ensured attentiveness to the visual stream. We reason that an improvement in behavioral performance in the match-target condition over the match-masker condition could only result from a benefit in separating the target and masker stream and thus be indicative of true, ongoing cross-modal binding, beyond a simple subjective report."

We ran an ANOVA for <i>d\u2032</i>, bias, hit rate, false alarm rate, and visual hit rate with a between-subjects factor of auditory event type (pitch or timbre) and a within-subjects factor of audio\u2013visual coherence condition (match-target, match-masker, match-neither) on the data uploaded as <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>. For <i>d\u2032</i>, we found a significant between-groups effect of event type [F(1, 30) = 9.36, p = 0.0046, \u03b1 = 0.05] and a significant within-subjects effect of coherence [F(2, 60) = 4.28, p = 0.018]. There was no interaction between these two factors (p = 0.60), indicating the generality of the effect of cross-modal coherence on the selective attention task to different features and experimental setups, as well as different task difficulties (as performance was significantly better with pitch events vs timbre events). <i>Post hoc</i> comparisons demonstrated that subjects performed better when the visual stimulus was coherent with the target auditory stream vs the auditory masker (match-target &gt; match-masker; p = 0.0049, Bonferroni-corrected \u03b1 = 0.017). Similar results were obtained for hit rate: there was a significant effect of event type [F(1, 30) = 10.1, p = 0.0034] and also of visual coherence [F(2, 60) = 1.286, p = 0.0497]. <i>Post hoc</i> tests also showed a significant difference between hit rate in the match-target and match-masker conditions (p = 0.011). These results suggest that a visual stimulus can enhance a coherent auditory stimulus, even when that visual stimulus provides no useful visual information. There was no significant difference between the match-neither condition and either of the other two conditions. Thus, while there is a clear benefit when the visual stimulus is coherent with an attentional target vs a distractor, it is not yet clear if the changes in performance represent a helpful enhancement of the target or a deleterious enhancement of the masker vs some neutral condition, such as the match-neither case or an auditory-only case."

The lack of a variation in bias solidifies the notion that the observed pattern of responses results from changes in auditory detectability. Neither factor had a significant effect on false alarm rate (p = 0.29 and 0.18) or visual hit rate (p = 0.10 and 0.091). For this reason, <i>post hoc</i> paired comparisons were not made."

However, the temporal dynamics of one event or a repeating sequence are quite unlike many natural sounds, including speech. A recent study addressed this by creating randomly timed sequences of discrete auditory-visual events, and showed that coherence discrimination was better for the unpredictable sequences than for predictable ones (<a href=\"#bib14\">Denison et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the noisy dynamics of stimulus features used here not only allowed our stimuli to more closely emulate speech, but likely also strengthened the bound percept."

In the unimodal case, temporal coherence between auditory features (i.e., pitch, timbre, location) is a principal contributor to the formation of auditory objects (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shamma et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Teki et al., 2013</a>); however, the definition of an object can be difficult to pin down. <a href=\"#bib21\">Griffiths and Warren (2004)</a> suggest criteria for what constitutes an auditory object. They first suggest that the incoming information corresponds to something in the sensory world; this often means a physical sound source, but they leave room in their definition for artificial sounds that could conceivably come from a real-world source. Second, object-related information should be separable from other incoming sensory information\u2014this was a major component of the present task. Third, an object demonstrates perceptual invariance. While this was not a focus of the present study, listeners' perceptions of the attended features were invariant in the face of fluctuating amplitude. The fourth and most interesting (in the context of the present discussion) criterion is that an object is generalizable between senses. The authors point out that it is \u2018less clear\u2019 whether analyzing sensory objects is affected by cross-modal correspondence. The notion of cross-modal objecthood is easy to accept but difficult to demonstrate conclusively. The sound-induced flash illusion (<a href=\"#bib38\">Shams et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2002</a>), where the number of quick flashes perceived is strongly biased by the number of coincident beeps, is affected by audio\u2013visual spatial congruence when observers are required to selectively attend to two spatially separated stimulus streams (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bizley et al., 2012</a>). This suggests that cross-modal sensory interaction is strongest when evidence supports information from both modalities as originating from the same object."

There is evidence from unimodal studies that both visual and auditory attention operate on perceptual objects, such that attention to one feature of an object enhances the perception of all its features (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alain and Arnott, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Blaser et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shinn-Cunningham, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Shamma et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Maddox and Shinn-Cunningham, 2012</a>). Here, we show that processing of auditory pitch and timbre are enhanced when auditory amplitude is coherent with visual size. In the case of the match-target condition, this is beneficial, with attention to the visual stimulus improving listening performance. Performance suffers in the match-masker case, where the incorrect auditory stream's features are enhanced through the same binding process."

Auditory target and masker (on the left) and visual streams (on the right) are depicted as bound sets of component features, with those connections shown as line segments. When there is cross-modal temporal coherence between a feature of an auditory and visual stream, those features are bound. This results in a cross-modal object (just as two auditory or visual streams with the same envelope very likely would have bound together as well). In the match-target condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), the to-be-attended features (highlighted with a yellow ellipse) become part of one object and are enhanced (shown by a thick bounding box). The features of the to-be-ignored stream are suppressed (shown as a broken bounding box). However, in the match-masker condition (center), attention to the target auditory and visual features is now across objects. To make matters worse, processing of the to-be-ignored auditory features is enhanced, increasing the false-alarm likelihood. In the match-neither case, attention must still be split between unbound auditory and visual streams, but the masking stream is not enhanced, leading to performance between the other two conditions. How this model might be biologically implemented remains to be elucidated, but one possibility is that cross-modal coherence between stimulus modalities enables neural activity patterns in visual cortex to reinforce the activity elicited by the coherent auditory stream in auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ghazanfar and Schroeder, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bizley and King, 2012</a>)."

Similar principles should govern the formation of cross-modal objects, with the caveat that only some stimulus features span sensory boundaries. These dimensions could be physical, such as time and space for audio-visual stimuli (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alais and Burr, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Talsma et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bizley et al., 2012</a>), or learned statistical correspondences, such as the linguistic connection between an image of someone with protruded lips and an auditory /u/ vowel. Within this object, all features are enhanced and disagreements or ambiguities are resolved, either by letting the more reliable modality dominate (typically vision for space, audition for timing [<a href=\"#bib45\">Talsma et al., 2010</a>]), or by creating an intermediary percept (e.g., the McGurk effect). Such integration is necessary for a perceptual object to be a reasonable model of a physical one, which cannot, for example, occupy more than one location at one time."

This influence instead occurred through a chain of bound features within a cross-modal object, with a shared temporal trajectory linking visual size and auditory amplitude and is, to our knowledge, the first example of a continuous visual signal benefitting listening abilities through enhanced auditory scene segregation."
