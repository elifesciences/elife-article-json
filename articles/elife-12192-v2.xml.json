A sequential sampling framework explains the speed and accuracy of decisions and extends naturally to the confidence that the decision rendered is likely to be correct. However, discrepancies between confidence and accuracy suggest that confidence might be supported by mechanisms dissociated from the decision process. Here we show that this discrepancy can arise naturally because of simple processing delays. When participants were asked to report choice and confidence simultaneously, their confidence, reaction time and a perceptual decision about motion were explained by bounded evidence accumulation. However, we also observed revisions of the initial choice and/or confidence. These changes of mind were explained by a continuation of the mechanism that led to the initial choice. Our findings extend the sequential sampling framework to vacillation about confidence and invites caution in interpreting dissociations between confidence and accuracy."

A sequential sampling framework explains the speed and accuracy of decisions and extends naturally to the confidence that the decision rendered is likely to be correct. However, discrepancies between confidence and accuracy suggest that confidence might be supported by mechanisms dissociated from the decision process. Here we show that this discrepancy can arise naturally because of simple processing delays. When participants were asked to report choice and confidence simultaneously, their confidence, reaction time and a perceptual decision about motion were explained by bounded evidence accumulation. However, we also observed revisions of the initial choice and/or confidence. These changes of mind were explained by a continuation of the mechanism that led to the initial choice. Our findings extend the sequential sampling framework to vacillation about confidence and invites caution in interpreting dissociations between confidence and accuracy."

In that case, a decision maker must decide not only about the proposition in question but also about when to terminate deliberation. The ensuing tradeoff between speed and accuracy is explained by <i>sequential sampling with optional stopping</i> models in which evidence is accumulated to some stopping criterion or bound (<a href=\"#bib37\">Link, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</a>). The mechanism receives experimental support from human psychophysics and neural recordings in monkeys and rats (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brunton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hanks et al., 2015</a>). The same framework also explains the confidence that a decision is correct (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kiani et al., 2014a</a>). This is because the quantity that is accumulated, termed a decision variable (DV), when combined with elapsed decision time, maps to the probability that a decision rendered on its value will be correct (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Drugowitsch et al., 2014</a>). The attribution of confidence is important for guiding subsequent decisions, learning from mistakes and exploring alternatives. Thus, when the decision maker terminates deliberation, the choice is accompanied by a degree of certainty (i.e., confidence), based on the same stream of evidence that supported that decision (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fetsch et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "This last point remains controversial, however, for there are many instances when the confidence in a decision and the decision itself are dissociable. For example, human decision makers tend to overestimate their certainty about choices based on truly ambiguous evidence (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fischoff et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baranski and Petrusic, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Erev et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Drugowitsch et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kiani et al., 2014a</a>), and they can perform above chance level yet report they are guessing (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kunimoto et al., 2001</a>). These and other observations have led psychologists to suggest that confidence and choice may be guided by different sources of evidence (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pleskac and Busemeyer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zylberberg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Moran et al., 2015</a>), or that the evaluation of the same evidence differs fundamentally in the way that it affects choice and confidence (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fleming and Dolan, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Maniscalco and Lau, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">De Martino et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ratcliff and Starns, 2013</a>). The latter distinction is captured by the notion of a 1st-order confidence that is based rationally on the evidence in support of the decision and a 2nd-order confidence that can depart from this evidence. As this distinction rests on a proper understanding of the mechanism that supports choice and confidence, it is possible that some of the observations taken as support for higher order explanations of confidence are simply accounted for by deficiencies of the theory of 1st order choices."

Such changes of mind occur occasionally, even when there appears to be no additional information available after the initial decision has been rendered. The sequential sampling framework (e.g., bounded evidence accumulation) offers a natural account of this phenomenon, because the mechanism incorporates processing delays, which leave open the possibility that the brain might have access to additional evidence that did not influence the initial decision and which might instead influence a revision. Evidence for such a process was adduced to explain reversals of perceptual decisions in humans and monkeys (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rabbitt, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rabbitt and Vyas, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">McPeek et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Caspi and Beutter, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Van Zandt and Maldonado-Molina, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Resulaj et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Burk et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kiani et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Moher and Song, 2014</a>). Here, we address the possibility that this same mechanism can account for a revision in the confidence a decision maker assigns to his or her choice. We hypothesized that such revisions might account for an apparent dissociation between degree of confidence and choice."

They simultaneously indicated both their choice and the confidence in that choice by moving a handle with their arm. We show that choice, confidence, and reaction time are explained by a sequential sampling mechanism operating on a common evidence stream. On a small fraction of trials, subjects changed their initial decision about the direction of motion and, more frequently, about their confidence. We show that confidence and choice are informed by the same evidence, both at the initial choice and on any subsequent revision. However, changes of confidence arising through post-decision processing can contribute to an apparent dissociation between confidence and decision."

Whenever ready, the subject moved a handle from the home position to one of four choice targets, thereby indicating simultaneously the direction decision and confidence level. On most trials subjects made an approximately straight-line movement to one of the choice targets. However, although the random dot stimulus was extinguished on movement onset, on a proportion of trials subjects changed their choice or confidence rating or both, initially reaching towards one target but deviating to reach another (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>).

Noisy sensory evidence from the random dot motion supports a race between a mechanism that accumulates evidence for right (and against left) and a mechanism that integrates evidence for left (and against right). Samples of momentary evidence are drawn from two (anti-correlated) Gaussian distributions with opposite means, which depend on the direction and motion strength of the stimulus. In this case the motion is rightward; therefore, the momentary evidence for right has a positive mean, and the rightward accumulator has positive drift. The first accumulation to reach an upper decision bound determines the choice and decision time. In this case the decision is for a rightward response. (<b>b</b>) Evolution of the decision variables (top) and log-odds (bottom) in the task. For simplicity we plot both accumulations on the same graph. At the initial decision time, the state of both the winning and losing processes as well as decision time confer the log-odds that a decision rendered on the evidence is likely to be correct, what we term confidence or belief. The bottom plot shows the log-odds of a rightward choice being correct, calculated from the decision variable and time. We assume that subjects adopt a consistent criterion <i>\u03b8\u00a0</i>on \u201cdegree of belief\u201d to decide in favor of high or low confidence. Note that the decision is terminated by the decision variable (top), not the log-odds (bottom). Although the motion stimulus is displayed up to the reaction time, the decision does not benefit from all of the information, owing to sensory and motor delays (<i>t<sub>s</sub></i> and <i>t<sub>m</sub>,</i> respectively). In the post-decision period, the accumulation therefore continues. Changes of confidence and/or decision are determined by which region the log-odds is in after processing for an additional time, <i>t</i><sub>pip</sub> \u2264 <i>t<sub>s</sub></i> + <i>t<sub>m</sub></i>. To incorporate energetics costs of changing a decision and having to reach mid-movement to a new target we allow the initial bounds to move from their initial levels (<i>\u03b4\u03b8<sub>1</sub>-\u03b4\u03b8<sub>3</sub></i>). This example uses the parameter fits for Subject 1 and a 3.2% coherence with an initial high confidence correct rightward decision followed by a change of confidence to a rightward, low-confidence decision (for an initial low-confidence example see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</a>)."

Since the winning process is at a fixed bound, the confidence is adequately summarized by the height of this bound, decision time, and the state of the losing accumulator. Thus the degree of belief is based on the balance of evidence (i.e., difference) between winning and losing DVs, as well as the decision time. This model has been tested in neurophysiology and a previous report in humans (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kiani et al., 2014a</a>) which extends ideas from signal detection theory, race, and Bayesian models (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vickers, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kepecs et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Maniscalco and Lau, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Drugowitsch et al., 2014</a>).

They also differed in their criteria for categorizing degree of belief into high and low, which can be appreciated by the separation of choice functions by confidence report. To maximize the number of points, given the reward structure (see Materials and methods), subjects should choose high confidence if they believe the probability of a correct choice is greater than two-thirds, which corresponds to a log-odds of 0.69. Interestingly the inferred criteria for all the subjects were close to this optimal criterion, although all subjects were somewhat risk-averse (probability thresholds of 0.71, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.75; thresholds in log-odd units shown in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

We used an alternative approach, which involves fitting a function, <i>f(t)</i>, to the psychophysical kernels. (<b>a</b>) The shape of <i>f(t)</i> was derived assuming that the slow decay of the psychophysical kernels when aligned on movement onset is due to: (<i>i</i>) trial-to-trial variability in the non-decision time, and (<i>ii</i>) the smoothing introduced by the impulse response of the motion energy (inset; same as in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Without these influences, the influence of motion fluctuations on choice would step to zero at a fixed latency (<i>\u03bc</i><sub>tnd</sub>) before movement (black solid line). Inter-trial variability in the non-decision time reduces the number of trials that contribute to the psychophysical kernel for times closer to movement onset. If this variability is assumed Gaussian, the step function is smoothed into a cumulative Gaussian (<i>g</i>[<i>t \u03bc<sub>tnd</sub></i>, <i>\u03c3<sub>tnd</sub></i>]; dashed line). To fit the psychophysical kernels, we also need to consider the additional smoothing introduced by the motion filter, which we do by convolving g(t) with the impulse response of the motion filter, <i>IR(t</i>), such that<math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mtext></mtext><mo></mo><mi>f</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>g</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>|</mo><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>*</mo><mi>I</mi><mi>R</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo></mo></mrow></math>, where is <math id=\"inf2\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math> is an arbitrary scaling parameter.

Indeed, when subjects changed their confidence rating from low to high, the motion information in the post-decision period supported the initial choice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>, bottom), whereas changes from high to low confidence were associated with motion information in support of the direction opposite to the one chosen (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>, middle), and this trend was amplified for changes of mind about direction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>, top)."

We assumed that evidence was accumulated past the point of the initial decision for a fixed amount of time (a free parameter, <i>t</i><sub>pip</sub>) that is less than the non-decision time. The state of the belief at <i>t</i><sub>pip</sub> determines the final confidence and choice (see Materials and methods). As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, we allowed for the possibility that subjects might not apply the identical criteria for confidence and choice in the pre- and post-initiation epoch (the <i>\u03b4\u03b8</i> parameters; see Materials and methods). The settings of <i>t</i><sub>pip</sub> and the <i>\u03b4\u03b8</i> parameters capture aspects of the energetic costs, by suppressing changes that would occur with small fluctuations in the evidence or very late in the movement. The trace in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a> illustrates an initial high-confidence, rightward choice. Evidence that arrived in the post-initiation period (i.e., too late to affect the initial choice) tended to favor leftward, detracting enough from the belief to support a change of confidence but not enough to support a change of decision in favor of leftward. The example shows a resistance to change because the total evidence actually favors leftward, but the model asserts a change of decision bound that is somewhat below the neutral evidence level."

Although the relation between the precise values of the <i>\u03b4\u03b8</i> parameters and behavior are hard to intuit, the trends are consistent. After an initial low confidence decision (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, top row), all subjects required more belief to change to a high confidence decision than would have been required for an initial high confidence decision (<i>\u03b4\u03b8</i><sub>1</sub>&gt;0). Similar hysteresis is seen for initial high confidence decisions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, bottom row). Moreover, all subjects required more evidence to change their initial decision about direction than a simple reversal in sign of the evidence (<i>\u03b4\u03b8</i><sub>2</sub>&gt;0). Finally, all participants relaxed their belief criterion when they changed their direction decision while either maintaining or changing to high confidence (<i>\u03b4\u03b8</i><sub>3</sub>&lt;0).

Rows show the thresholds for an initial low- (top) and high- (bottom) confidence rightward decision (i.e., initial decisions that end in the region indicated by the vertical black bar in the plot for Subject 1).

The observation supports a parsimonious account of decision confidence which is somewhat at odds with recent literature on meta-cognition (see Discussion). Evidence for a meta-cognitive process is adduced from a dissociation between the signal-to-noise properties of the evidence that would support a level of choice accuracy versus the level associated with a degree of confidence (e.g., meta-d\u2032; see <a href=\"#bib17\">Fleming and Lau, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Maniscalco and Lau, 2012</a>). The meta-<i>d\u2032</i> statistic is not well behaved in the sequential sampling framework, but the basic logic remains applicable (see Materials and methods). In <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, we compare two odds ratios (OR). Both express the relative probability of a high-confidence rating, given a correct or error choice. Along the abscissa, we base the OR on the initial confidence ratings, whereas on the ordinate, we use the final confidence ratings, thus accommodating the change of confidence. In essence, we are pretending that the subject indicated her choice and subsequently told us her confidence. Clearly, there is a systematic discrepancy between the OR pairs (P&lt;1e-4, sign test). All but one of the points are above the main diagonal, and the difference in OR is statistically reliable for 13 of the 19 individual points (4 subjects\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05 non-zero motion strengths with at least 1 error; P&lt;0.05, bootstrap; see Materials and methods). This discrepancy might be regarded as a sign of 2nd-order confidence, whereas it is simply the result of a continuation of the 1st-order process that couples choice and confidence, via bounded evidence accumulation."

The ORs calculated from the initial confidence report establish a baseline: the breakdown of confidence associated with the information that explains the accuracy at each motion strength. The ORs calculated from the final confidence report are larger and might thus be mistakenly interpreted as support for a dissociation between determinants of choice and confidence.

Often, all we know about the accuracy of a choice is a degree of confidence. The attribution of confidence is important for guiding subsequent decisions, learning from mistakes and exploring alternatives. The present study establishes that this assessment evolves in time and, like the choice itself, can undergo revision with additional evidence. The study of perceptual decision-making offers insight into the process because the stream of evidence can be controlled experimentally. This is especially so in the present study using random dot kinematograms because the temporal stream of evidence is effectively a sequence of independent, statistically stationary samples. In other types of decisions\u2014and most perceptual ones as well\u2014the samples of evidence are derived from internal evaluations and memory processes, which are less well characterized, but which also evolve as a function of time."

The mechanism (and models) also expose a discrepancy between the information supplied to the decision maker and the information that is actually used to make the decision. Specifically, there are processing delays between the arrival of information from the environment and updating its representation in working memory as a decision variable bearing on a proposition, and there are delays between commitment to a decision and communicating this decision through the motor system. Even in relatively fast perceptual decisions, this so-called non-decision time typically exceeds 300 ms."

The present study extends these observations to the metacognitive operation of assigning a degree of belief that the decision is correct. The finding is important for several reasons. First, it establishes that deliberation in the post-initiation epoch is as rich a process as the deliberation preceding initiation. This implies that termination has a kind of specificity; it marks the end of deliberation for purposes of response initiation, but it does not actually terminate all deliberation. We suspect that this is just one aspect of a more general property. For example, the same information can bear on a variety of potential actions and cognitive operations, which need not share identical speed-accuracy tradeoffs and thus deliberate for different amounts of time."

We explain the initial choice and confidence using the identical stream of information, as in a previous study (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kiani et al., 2014a</a>). The model is by no means perfect (e.g., it overestimates confidence at the lowest motion strength), but it demonstrates, nonetheless, that on many trials, the final confidence judgments are clearly based on additional information that did not affect the initial choice. This assertion is supported by the analysis of motion energy leading to the confidence choices (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Just a few hundred milliseconds of additional evidence led to changes in the confidence associated with the initial choice, ranging from 1.5\u20136.3% of trials across our subjects, and this was enough to induce a clear departure from the level of confidence that ought to be associated with the evidence available at the time of the initial choice. In other words, had we asked our subjects only for their confidence rating after they indicated their initial choice\u2014without an opportunity to revise those choices\u2014we would have detected a different relationship between confidence and accuracy (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). When confidence is assessed after the initial choice, as it is in most experiments, then it ought to come as no surprise that choice and confidence are explained by only partially overlapping sources of information. Importantly, however, this does not imply a dissociation between confidence and the decision (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pleskac and Busemeyer, 2010</a>), as the latter can also be revised based on the same additional information."

However, our result invites caution when interpreting such divergence as indicators of metacognitive processes. Does the divergence necessarily implicate a process of a different nature, as implied by the distinction between 1st and 2nd order processes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fleming and Dolan, 2012</a>)? Or, is it possible that the mechanism responsible for assigning confidence based on the additional evidence is compatible with the one that supports a choice\u2014perhaps a different choice were the decision maker given an opportunity to revise (consistent with the original notion of type-1 and type-2 decisions; <a href=\"#bib9\">Clarke et al., 1959</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Galvin et al., 2003</a>)? The evaluation of additional evidence may explain why confidence ratings are more strongly correlated with accuracy when they are reported with less time pressure (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yu et al., 2015</a>), and why some individuals appear to be better than others at discriminating correct from incorrect decisions (e.g. <a href=\"#bib2\">Ais et al., 2016</a>). The central question is whether this additional information affects confidence in a manner that is fundamentally different from the process that would tie these attributes together. In our study, the answer seems to be negative, and we speculate that the interesting aspects of more real-world distinctions involving re-evaluation of evidence using memory, for example, will require better understanding of the way that memory and decision processes interact but not a fundamentally different mechanism for associating confidence with the evidence arising from that process."

By definition, confidence may be regarded as metacognitive, simply because it is a report about the decision process itself. Yet the operations leading to confidence seem neither mysterious nor dissociable from the decision process (cf. <a href=\"#bib10\">De Martino et al., 2013</a>). That said, there are many unknown features of the underlying mechanism. We know little about the establishment of the mapping between belief and the representation of evidence and time. Nor do we know how a criterion is applied to this mapping to render the categorical choices in our study, or in post-decision wagering decisions (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</a>), or in confidence ratings (<a href=\"#bib39\">Maniscalco and Lau, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fleming and Lau, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kiani et al., 2014a</a>). An appealing idea is that this also looks like a threshold crossing in the brain with dynamic costs associated with time (e.g., urgency <a href=\"#bib57\">Thura et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</a>) and dynamic biases (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hanks et al., 2011</a>). Presumably, downstream structures that represent confidence-related values such as reward prediction error, must approximate the mapping between decision variable\u2014represented in LIP and other brain areas\u2014and elapsed time (or number of samples) to achieve this. Of course, downstream structures that control the arm must have access to the decision about both direction and confidence to control the initial reach and possibly revise the movement. To explain our findings, we assumed that choice and confidence are related but processed as if separate attributes, via a correspondence between decision variable and belief. It is intriguing to think that the two dimensions, which are bound together into a single action by the motor reach system in our task, could be dissociated in cognition and memory."

For each trial, the final decision was determined by the choice target reached. To determine whether a change of decision had taken place we calculated the area between the hand\u2019s path over the first 1 cm of movement and the vertical line through the hand\u2019s initial starting location (i.e. the line separating the left and right choice targets). A change of decision was reflected in the area on the side opposite to the final choice being greater than 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Resulaj et al., 2009</a>). The same procedure was applied to determine changes of confidence with the area now calculated relative to the horizontal line separating the high and low confidence choice targets. On each trial, we thus obtain the initial and final decision: choice (left/right), confidence (low/high), and reaction time (time between stimulus onset and movement initiation). We show combined data for the two target configurations (high/low confidence targets at top/bottom), having reassured ourselves that the arrangement had no detectable effects on choice accuracy (p\u22650.4; Fisher\u2019s exact test) and only small effects on\u00a0reaction\u00a0time (RT) for 2 subjects (magnitudes&lt;3%, p&lt;0.01; t-test). There was a subtle bias for the bottom targets (50.6, 51.9, 52.5 and 51.4%, respectively), possibly due to kinematic factors, but recall that\u00a0the orientation was balanced across the experiment."

To quantify the fluctuations of motion along the horizontal axis, we convolved the sequence of random dots shown on each trial with a pair of spatiotemporal oriented filters, selective for rightward and leftward motion. The filters were matched to the speed and displacement of the coherently moving dots (see details in <a href=\"#bib1\">Adelson and Bergen, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kiani et al., 2008</a>).

In signal detection theory (SDT), <i>d\u2032</i> refers to the difference between the means of two standard Normal distributions, <i>X<sub>1</sub></i>~N(<i>\u03bc<sub>1</sub>,1</i>) and <i>X<sub>2</sub></i>~N(<i>\u03bc<sub>2</sub>,1</i>), where <i>X</i><sub>n</sub> is a random variable and N(<i>\u03bc<sub>1</sub>,\u03c3</i>) is a Normal distribution with mean <i>\u03bc<sub>1</sub></i> and standard deviation <i>\u03c3</i>. The two distributions might represent signal-plus-noise and noise-alone or the distributions of firing rates of neurons tuned to opposite directions of motion (e.g., <a href=\"#bib4\">Britten et al., 1992</a>). For binary classification we can conceive of a single distribution of the difference between samples of <i>X<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>X<sub>2</sub></i>, such that <i>X<sub>\u2206</sub></i>~N(<i>d\u2032</i>,<math id=\"inf5\"><mrow><mo>\u221a</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math>), assuming independence. <i>X<sub>\u2206</sub></i> thus represents a DV whose sign identifies the more likely alternative. There is a one-to-one correspondence between proportion correct and <i>d\u2032</i>. Applied to binary classification tasks, meta-<i>d\u2032</i>\u00a0is the value of <i>d\u2032</i>\u00a0that would support the proportions of high-confidence ratings on error and correct choices, respectively, based on the assumption that the confidence designation is based on comparison of X<sub>\u2206</sub> to some arbitrary but fixed criterion. Thus, within the SDT framework, if meta-<i>d\u2032</i>\u2260<i>d\u2032</i> then it is not possible to account for the confidence ratings using the same signal:noise relationship that supports the choice accuracy, and this discrepancy has been interpreted as a sign of meta-cognitive confidence (<a href=\"#bib39\">Maniscalco and Lau, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fleming and Lau, 2014</a>). However, the SDT framework must be extended to account for RT and choice. Under sequential sampling (e.g., bounded drift diffusion), meta-<i>d\u2032</i> \u2260 <i>d\u2032</i>, even when the choice and confidence are explained by the same decision variable.

Momentary evidence was modeled as draws from a bivariate Gaussian with a mean that depends on the coherence (<i>C</i>) such that drift rate (/s) is <i>\u03baC</i> for the rightward and -<i>\u03baC</i> for the leftward accumulator, giving a mean of (<i>\u03baC,-\u03baC</i>).

A decision is made when one of the two races crosses a decision bound <i>B</i>.

For any setting of the parameters, the model predicts the probability of each of the 4 possible initial choices and the mean reaction times for each coherence level. To fit model parameters we minimized the negative log likelihood (i.e., cost), using a multinomial distribution for the 4 choice types and Gaussian distribution for the sample mean RTs.

Importantly, this choice of covariance also allowed us to use an analytic solution to the race model when fitting.

The variability across runs was minimal, suggesting that the optimization procedure converged to global maximum."

A change in confidence or choice would occur if at the end of this period the log odds crossed a confidence or choice threshold, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Since there are motor costs involved in changes of mind, we included additional parameters that could move the confidence and choice thresholds away from their initial values in the post-initiation stage by <i>\u03b4\u03b8</i><sub>1</sub><i>, \u03b4\u03b8</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>\u03b4\u03b8</i><sub>3\u00a0</sub>(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). The three thresholds split the final decision into four zones and the specification of these thresholds depended on whether the initial choice was low or high confidence. For an initial high-confidence choice, the three thresholds were <i>\u03b8\u2013\u03b4\u03b8</i><sub>1</sub><i>, -\u03b4\u03b8</i><sub>2</sub>, and <i>\u2013\u03b8\u2013\u03b4\u03b8</i><sub>3</sub>, respectively (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). For an initial low-confidence decision, the first threshold was instead <i>\u03b8+\u03b4\u03b8</i><sub>1</sub>. To fit the model to each subject\u2019s data, for each unsigned coherence we calculated the number of trials corresponding to the 16 possible events that could occur over the trial (4 possible initial choices and 4 possible final choices) and again used maximum likelihood to fit the four free parameters carrying over <i>\u03ba</i> and <i>\u03b8\u00a0</i>from the initial decision fits."

In principle, such a mechanism could terminate post-initiation processing more flexibly, but the frequency of change of mind about choice and confidence is too small to evaluate this possibility."

Model 1 exploits a classic idea from signal-detection-theory, and assigns confidence based on a threshold on the balance of evidence (ignoring deliberation time) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vickers, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kepecs et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kepecs and Mainen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wei and Wang, 2015</a>). Model 2, assigns confidence based on threshold on decision time only, thus ignoring the balance of evidence. We fit both models to our participants\u2019 data. They have the same number of parameters (4) as the original model. A 4-choice model for the initial choice-confidence decision (based on dynamic programming) is worthy of consideration but we have yet to find a satisfactory account of our data with this approach."

This paper makes major new contributions to these problems, particularly with regard to the issue of confidence, and whether confidence judgements can be naturally explained in the same framework used to explain accuracy and reaction time. The authors use a very clever experimental paradigm for human psychophysics, in which the direction a lever is moved lets subjects not only indicate their choice (left or right) but also whether this choice has high or low confidence. As a result, both changes of choice and changes of confidence can be seen by changes in hand movement."

E.g. subject 1 has only two (out of 6) error-trial data points situated near the fitted line, and only one data point for subject 2 (part of the issue in realising this is that the purple error trial points are often hidden behind the green correct trial points, it would be useful to jitter these sideways for visualisation). This is the case even though there are several hundred error trials particularly at lower coherences with correspondingly tight error bars on confidence proportions. This discrepancy is particularly apparent at 0% coherence, where subjects 1, 2 and 4 show substantially lower confidence than predicted by the model. I'm not suggesting therefore that there can't be a common mechanism that does a good job of explaining all these data features (e.g. perhaps subjects are inferring on coherence, leading to lower confidence at 0% than predicted by a model that marginalizes coherence?). But it seems reasonable that a putative common mechanism driving choice, RT and confidence should do an equally good job of explaining each feature separately."

One subject was excluded for a strong high-confidence biasand absence of confidence-accuracy correlation, which is indeed at odds with the proposed mechanism linking choice and confidence, but perhaps not with other models. Similarly the second half of subject 4's data is excluded because they changed the way they reported confidence half way through the session.

This is the case even though there are several hundred error trials particularly at lower coherences with correspondingly tight error bars on confidence proportions. This discrepancy is particularly apparent at 0% coherence, where subjects 1, 2 and 4 show substantially lower confidence than predicted by the model. I'm not suggesting therefore that there can't be a common mechanism that does a good job of explaining all these data features (e.g. perhaps subjects are inferring on coherence, leading to lower confidence at 0% than predicted by a model that marginalizes coherence?).

We are aware that the fits are not perfect, and we now acknowledge this in the revised manuscript. The pathology in our view arises from several factors: the fit is driven by the more frequent observations (i.e. correct choices); we do not fit the correlation between races which is fixed to a sensible value (only a few values of correlation lead to an analytically tractable fitting procedure); the bounds are stationary (i.e., flat). We suspect that a combination of these factors contribute to the poorer fit of the errors.

The other qualitative failures are best appreciated by drawing on intuitions associated with a simpler diffusion model \u2013 with symmetric, flat bounds for right and left choices. This is mathematically identical to our competing accumulators but with perfect anti-correlation. In the simpler 1-dimensional model, (1) there is no balance of evidence; (2) the DV is at the level of the upper or lower bound at decision termination, (3) the proportion correct is independent of decision time, and (4) mean RT on correct and error choices are the same for any motion coherence. Based on point 3, we would expect the choice functions in the left column to be identical. They are not exactly the same because our model is a race between two negatively correlated but non-redundant accumulators, and in our particular instantiation (e.g., no reflecting lower bounds), this yields slightly faster errors, which are assigned higher confidence (left column).

Beginning with the latter (B), we agree that it would have been odd to ignore the new winner\u2019s accumulator, but that is not what we did. Log-odds is calculated by taking all available information into account, i.e., the state of the winning accumulator, the state of the losing accumulator, and elapsed time. Regarding the first point (A), we actually conceive of similar operations in the initial- and post-initiation epoch. Both rely on the two integrators (which are negatively correlated, so not independent) and elapsed time to establish the log-odds for confidence, and in both epochs, the choice is based on the states of the competing accumulators. We were opaque on this last point because we adopted, and failed to explain, a simplification, applied to the post-initiation epoch only, that allowed us to display the change-of-direction bound as a threshold in belief space. We will justify the simplification in a moment, but the important point is that there is really no conceptual \u201casymmetry.\u201d Before justifying the simplification, we need to explain the more fundamental awkwardness that the reviewers spotlight \u2013 that is, why wasn't the initial decision based upon a measure that combines the two integrators, such as log-odds?"

For example, (1) If decisions terminate on the same log odds correct, confidence (by definition) would be the same for all choices, independent of reaction time and stimulus strength. Even if the log-odds bounds were to move in time, the confidence would be purely time-dependent and not depend on coherence (inconsistent with Kiani et al., Neuron, 2014). (2) A constant log-odds correct bound would produce a very flat choice function (probability correct as a function of coherence) and bizarrely long reaction times. (3) Neural representations of accumulated evidence have been reported in several areas of the monkey brain. The drift and noise are consistent with the representation of a DV, and there is a signature of a terminating bound applied to the neural representation of the winning DV. All of the information to compute log-odds correct is available in the state of the competing DVs and elapsed time, but there is no evidence that the firing rate of the competing accumulators combine these sources to represent log-odds explicitly."

Because the information available in this epoch is limited by <i>t<sub>nd</sub></i> and motor costs, we assumed that subjects would base their choices on all the available information up to some point (<i>t<sub>pip</sub></i>\u2264 <i>t<sub>nd</sub></i>). Thus we are ignoring explicitly (it is now explicit in the revision) the likelihood that a change of mind has a termination rule. We think it does (with all kinds of interesting motor costs), but there are too few trials to achieve traction on this, as we now explain. Expressing changes of confidence via a criterion in log-odds is already the natural choice, of course. We conceive of the change of mind about direction as operating on the state of the DVs at <i>t<sub>pip</sub></i>. For example, were the criterion for change of choice simply a change in the sign of the balance of evidence, this would be identical to a log-odds criterion at zero. However, the hysteresis effect for choice places the criterion on DV on one or the other side of zero. In summary, our simplifying assumption introduces a minor approximation which allows us to illustrate changes of confidence and choice on the same figure, which we view as useful to readers \u2013 or should be now that we have cleared up the confusion."

We do not have much to say about this, but the analysis in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> demonstrates one reason why a subject might have higher metacognitive sensitivity than another. When confidence is reported after a choice, confidence can be influenced by additional evidence accrued after the commitment to a choice. The idea is similar to one discussed by Pleskac and Busemeyer (2010), and more recently by Moran, Teodorescu and Usher (2015) and Yu, Pleskac and Zeigenfuse (2015). The analysis of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> demonstrates that the opportunity to revise the initial confidence based on additional evidence leads to higher \u2018metacognitive\u2019 sensitivity. Therefore, an intriguing possibility is that individuals with higher metacognitive sensitivity are those that can accumulate evidence for longer periods of time (or more efficiently) after the commitment to a choice. This mechanism could account for individual differences in sensitivity without the need to postulate separate mechanisms for choice and for confidence. Furthermore, it is empirically testable, with analyses like those shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. We now have added the following to Discussion:"

And for the high coherence trials certainty is at around 0.9 despite almost perfect performance. So the high-low effect arises naturally from the diffusion model. The reviewers\u2019 intuitions are partly correct, but the deterministic component of the DV contributes a biastoward higher confidence for all correct trials. The deeper intuition behind high-low is to think about all the motion strengths and directions that could have given rise to the DVs at decision time. The DVs achieved in a high-coherence trial could occasionally arise in a low- or intermediate-coherence trial. This possibility biases confidence to lower values despite nearly perfect accuracy on high-coherence trials. Similarly, the DVs achieved in a low-coherence trial could be occasionally observed in an intermediate- or high-coherence trial, biasing confidence on low-coherence trials to higher values despite near chance accuracy."

Computation of confidence in their model is in essence similar to the Balance of Evidence model explained above (see point #4). It suffers from the same shortcomings too.
