These RNAs, which bind to targeted mRNAs via limited base pairing interactions, act to reduce protein production from those mRNAs. Considerable evidence indicates that miRNAs destabilize targeted mRNAs by recruiting enzymes that function in normal mRNA decay and mRNA degradation is widely thought to occur when mRNAs are in a ribosome free state. Nevertheless, when examined, miRNA targeted mRNAs are invariably found to be polysome associated; observations that appear to be at face value incompatible with a simple decay model. Here, we provide evidence that turnover of miRNA-targeted mRNAs occurs while they are being translated. Cotranslational mRNA degradation is initiated by decapping and proceeds 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 behind the last translating ribosome. These results provide an explanation for a long standing mystery in the miRNA field."

                        "text": "microRNAs, a large family of regulatory molecules discovered over twenty years ago, have been shown to exert pervasive effects on a wide array of biological processes (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib2\">Ameres and Zamore, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ebert and Sharp, 2012</a>). It has become clear that a majority of mRNAs are targeted by miRNAs via limited base pairing interactions between the miRNAs and miRNA responsive elements (MREs) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bartel, 2009</a>). Although there are exceptions, most MREs are located in 3\u2019 UTRs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bartel, 2009</a>). The current consensus view of miRNA-mediated gene regulation is that it involves post-transcriptional down regulation of protein production from targeted mRNAs. Repression by miRNAs is largely attributable to mRNA destabilization and several lines of evidence indicate that this destabilization involves recruitment of factors which participate in normal mRNA decay pathways (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bagga et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Guo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Eichhorn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Eulalio et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015</a>). These factors include deadenylases and decapping enzymes (e.g. <a href=\"#bib10\">Braun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chekulaeva et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rehwinkel et al., 2005</a>)."

In very early studies, the first miRNA targeted mRNAs were found to be fully associated with polysomes (<a href=\"#bib48\">Olsen and Ambros, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Seggerson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wightman et al., 1993</a>). These observations have been reproduced numerous times over the years; whenever the subcellular localization of mRNA targets has been examined, those mRNAs are found to be exclusively on polysomes and unambiguous evidence has indicated that these polysomes are engaged in active translation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nottrott et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Petersen et al., 2006</a>). Complementing these studies are several studies indicating that a substantive fraction of miRNAs themselves is also associated with actively translating ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Maroney et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nelson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kim et al., 2004</a>). Other observations, including the fact that MREs are less effective when present in open reading frames and the presence of a so-called ribosome shadow (absence of MREs in the 3\u2019 UTR just downstream of stop codons) are consistent with an interaction between miRNA-effector complexes and translating ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bartel, 2009</a>). In sum, this body of evidence has led to the development of the hypothesis, which still persists in the literature, that miRNAs regulate translation in some way during the elongation phase but this hypothesis has been recalcitrant to mechanistic proof."

The conundrum is that the prevalent view of mRNA decay holds that decay occurs when mRNAs are in a ribosome free state, perhaps in subcellular aggregates known as P bodies, sites of concentrated RNA degradative activities (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib59\">Valencia-Sanchez et al., 2006</a>). Here, we provide a solution to this longstanding puzzle by demonstrating that miRNA-mediated mRNA decay occurs cotranslationlly. Decay is initiated by mRNA decapping while targeted mRNAs are polysome bound and proceeds 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 following the last translating ribosome. These observations provide a unifying explanation for a large amount of what has been thought to be disparate experimental data."

To address this gap and to avoid potential pitfalls associated with transient transfection approaches, we elected to study stable cell lines expressing miRNA targeted mRNAs and relied on endogenous miRNAs to repress them. Because miRNA targeted mRNAs are particularly well characterized in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stark et al., 2003</a>), we chose to analyze <i>Drosophila</i> mRNAs encoding the proapoptotic proteins, reaper and hid. The reaper mRNA contains one microRNA recognition element (MRE) for the <i>Drosophila</i> miR-2 family of miRNA (miRs 2a, 2b, 2c, 6, 11, 13a, 13b, 308) in its 3\u2019UTR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jovanovic and Hengartner, 2006</a>). The hid mRNA contains five MREs for the miRNA, bantam, in its 3\u2019 UTR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brennecke et al., 2003</a>). To avoid the issue that overexpression of either the reaper or hid proteins would promote apopotosis, the entire 3\u2019 UTRs of both mRNAs were appended to the firefly luciferase coding sequence and 5\u2019 UTR (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Two versions of each 3\u2019 UTR, one containing wild type MREs and one containing mutant MREs were used in the construction of four stable <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cell lines. Cell lines were judged to be stable when no loss of cells was observed in the presence of the drugs used for their selection and when luciferase levels remained constant over several cell doublings. Reaper constructs were under control of the inducible metallothionine promoter (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bunch et al., 1988</a>) while the hid constructs were under control of the constitutive actin promoter (<a href=\"#bib3\">Angelichio et al., 1991</a>)."

The mir2 mimic was synthesized to contain a seed sequence complementary to the altered nucleotides in the mutated reporter reaper reporter UTR. For the Bantam mimic, the seed was complementary to the new target sequence shown in supplemental <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> present in all of the altered Bantam sites. The control dsRNA was a negative control recommended by IDT. For optimization of transfection conditions a double stranded siRNA of the same design was used to target the Firefly luciferase coding sequence. Titrations of dsRNA, plasmid and transfection reagent (Mirius Transit-X2) were performed to optimize expression and knockdown conditions as assayed by Luciferase readings in cells cotransfected with Firefly siRNA. For half life measurement, S2 cells were co-transfected with reporter and dsRNA in 10 cm plates at a starting density of 2X10<sup>6</sup>/ml. 24\u2009hr after transfection, cells were removed from plates, distributed on 6 well plates and 0.1 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> was added for an additional 16\u2009hr at which point 5 \u00b5g/ml Actinomycin D was added, media was removed at the indicated times and cells were lysed with Trizol. Because of the low abundance of transfected reporter RNAs, the analysis of RNA half life was done by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (<a href=\"#bib41\">Maroney et al., 2006</a>). cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 \u00b5g total RNA using random primers and Superscript II. PCR reactions were first titrated for linearity using a series of cDNA dilutions and cycle numbers. Linear PCR reactions (25 cycles for Reaper and Hid reporters, 20 cycles for Rp49) were carried out in the presence of \u03b1<sup>32</sup>P dCTP and analyzed on non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels."

Remarkably, fractionation of cytoplasmic extracts in this manner revealed that all detectable mRNAs for all four of the constructs cosedimented with polysomes, an observation that suggested that the mRNAs were associated with translating ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To ensure that polysome associated mRNA accounted for most or all mRNAs present in the cell, we performed an \u201caccounting\u201d experiment analogous to that we previously reported for miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Maroney et al., 2006</a>) We found that the vast majority of reporter mRNAs was indeed associated with polysomes and that there was negligible mRNA loss during extract preparation or gradient fractionation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) compare lanes total and gradient. To determine if polysome associated mRNAs were actually being translated, cells were treated with either emetine, an irreversible inhibitor of translation elongation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akinboye and Bakare, 2011</a>), or Harringtonine, an inhibitor of protein synthesis that binds to the A site of initiating ribosomes only and thereby prevents formation of the first peptide bond (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fresno et al., 1977</a>). Because Harringtonine inhibits formation of only the first peptide bond; ribosomes that are already elongating continue to translocate through the open reading frame and eventually terminate and disassociate from the mRNA. As elongating ribosomes clear the mRNA, polysomes become smaller and the mRNA shifts to lighter fractions of the gradient; newly initiating messages accumulate in the monosome region (80S). Extracts prepared from Harringtonine treated cells were sedimented on sucrose gradients and fractions were analyzed by Northern blotting. These analyses revealed that all four mRNAs shifted to lighter fractions; a result which indicated that all four mRNAs were associated with actively translating ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with other earlier observations (<a href=\"#bib41\">Maroney et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nelson et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kim et al., 2004</a>), both endogenous bantam and a representative member of the miR-2 family (miR-13b) showed similar sedimentation behavior as these targeted mRNAs; i.e. a substantive amount of each miRNA sedimented with polysomes and shifted to lighter fractions upon Harringtonine treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Endogenous mRNAs encoding the ribosomal protein L32 (RP49) and polyA binding protein (PABP) were, as expected, also present on translating ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). At this point in our analysis it was clear that endogenous miRNAs were causing marked destabilization of targeted mRNAs, yet all detectable mRNAs were associated with actively translating ribosomes."

In the first, translational initiation was somehow blocked on targeted mRNAs. After elongating ribosomes cleared the mRNA, the ribosome free mRNA was degraded so quickly that it could not be detected. The second scenario was that decay was occurring while the mRNAs were being translated; i.e. in a ribosome bound state. A clue to distinguish between these possibilities came from examination of long exposures of the Northern blot across polysome gradients shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. We observed a family of hybridizing species that were smaller than full length (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We speculated that these species might have resulted from partial degradation of the mRNA. If this was the case, we predicted that such fragments would become enriched relative to full length mRNA if new synthesis of mRNA was prevented. Accordingly, we stopped ongoing transcription with Actinomycin D and incubated cells for approximately one mRNA half life in order to allow for partial decay of pre-existing mRNA; translation was then arrested with emetine (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

It has been shown in <i>Drosophila</i> that miRNAs bound to Ago1 recruit GW182; a protein that in turn recruits the CCR4-Not deadenylase complex (e.g. <a href=\"#bib10\">Braun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chekulaeva et al., 2011</a>).

Consistent with this, only trace amounts of ligation products diagnostic of decapped RP49 mRNA were present in total RNA. However, after treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP), an enzyme that removes the cap, a robust signal for decapped RP49 was obtained (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We then used the ligation assay to analyze the reaper reporter mRNA. In this case we set up the assay to detect any 5\u2019 phosphorylated mRNA fragments containing a 5\u2019 terminal phosphate present in the region of the reaper reporter mRNA ranging from its transcription start site to just downstream of the AUG initiation codon. Here, we observed strong signals in the absence of TAP a result indicating that decapped mRNAs were present at steady state. Only the band corresponding to the mRNA start site was enhanced by TAP treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Importantly, detection of these fragments was ligase dependent and just a trace of fragments were detected in RNA prepared from cells in which DCP 1 and 2 were knocked down (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). When the assay was used to detect decay fragments across a polysome gradient we observed signal throughout the polysome region of the gradient (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and see Discussion). Cloning of bands denoted by asterisks showed that their 5\u2019 ends mapped at or near the transcription start site and near the translation initiation codon (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). These results demonstrated that the decay fragments we observed had resulted from decapping of the reporter mRNA while it was polysome bound."

While we have analyzed\u00a0only two miRNA targets, we think it likely that these observations will be broadly relevant. In cases where the subcellular localization of miRNA targets have been studied, they have invariably been found to be polysome associated (<a href=\"#bib48\">Olsen and Ambros, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Seggerson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wightman et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nottrott et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Petersen et al., 2006</a>). Moreover, miRNAs themselves have been shown to be polysome associated (<a href=\"#bib41\">Maroney et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nelson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kim et al., 2004</a>). Our observations are also consistent with a large body of transcriptome wide analyses obtained from studies primarily in mammalial systems that have shown that mRNA destabilization is the primary if not sole effect of miRNA-mediated down regulation of protein production from targeted mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Guo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Eichhorn et al, 2014</a>). They are also consistent with studies in <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells that have shown that miRNA effector complexes as well as general decay enzymes including deadenylases and decapping factors are ribosome associated (<a href=\"#bib4\">Antic et al., 2015</a>). While cotranslational miRNA-mediated mRNA decay rationalizes a very large body of published results, there are some observations that are difficult to reconcile with this unifying model of miRNA-mediated action. For example one study in a <i>C. elegans</i> cell free system showed that miRNA-targeted mRNAs were deadenylated and translationally repressed but not degraded (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wu et al., 2010</a>). Another example, also from <i>C. elegans,</i> used ribosome profiling in vivo to show that miRNA mediated regulation in some cases correlated with mRNA abundance but in other cases did not (<a href=\"#bib56\">Stadler et al., 2012</a>). Finally, there are also examples of <i>Drosophila</i> miRNA targeted mRNAs which appear to be regulated at the level of translation and not stability (e.g. <a href=\"#bib33\">Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011</a> and <a href=\"#bib8\">Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">2006b</a>). These examples might indicate that some specific mRNPs are subject to distinct regulatory pathways. Future studies may elucidate mRNP specific factors that mediate these effects."

Indeed over the years a large variety of different inhibition scenarios have been proposed including mRNA sequestration from the translation apparatus and inactivation of an array of initiation factors (e.g. <a href=\"#bib59\">Valencia-Sanchez et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mathonnet et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Chendrimada et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kiriakidou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fukaya et al., 2014</a>), the latest being eIF4AI and II (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fukao et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Meijer et al., 2013</a>). Unfortunately none of these mechanisms including eIF4AI and II (see <a href=\"#bib28\">Galicia-V\u00e1zquez et al., 2015</a>) has received sustained experimental support and it is currently unclear how or if initiation of translation is truly impaired in a microRNA-mediated fashion."

For general mRNA decapping, translational initiation is also believed to be in competition with the DCP2/1 holoenzyme. Importantly, despite this well accepted notion that initiation and decapping compete, it remains to be established how, when, or even if dissolution of the translational initiation complex occurs prior to DCP2/1-mediated cleavage. Thus the events triggering decapping are still murky but may include recruitment of the RNA helicase DDX6 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mathys et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rouya et al., 2014</a>).

                        "text": "The first report of inhibition of initiation of translation came from polysome analysis where it was shown that an miRNA targeted mRNA migrated on lighter polysomes than a control mRNA (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pillai et al., 2005</a>). Notably, however, all of the targeted mRNA was associated with ribosomes; there was no mRNA sedimenting in the RNP region of the gradient (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pillai et al., 2005</a>). These results were interpreted to mean that miRNAs repressed translation initiation. We too observe that targeted mRNAs migrate on lighter polysomes than untargeted mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). However, we suggest an alternative explanation for this phenomenon. It seems possible that the act of decapping itself could account for the altered sedimentation of targeted mRNAs. If decapping is a prerequisite for but not rate limiting for mRNA decay, decapped but not degraded mRNAs could persist. Because already engaged ribosomes would continue to elongate and eventually terminate, decapped but intact mRNAs would shift to lighter polysomes as elongating ribosomes clear the mRNA. We note that this notion is not entirely speculative. We have observed decapped mRNAs with 5\u2019 termini that map both near the start site of the mRNA and near the translational initiation codon. Importantly, these RNAs, which would appear to be full length, are detected throughout polysomes of different sizes both large and small (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These observations indicate that 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 exonucleolytic decay is not obligatorily coupled to decapping because if such coupling existed we would not observe full length decapped mRNA. It seems possible the concentration of degradation fragments near the initiation AUG could result from the buildup of ribosomes near the beginning of the open reading frame as observed in ribosome profiling studies (e.g. <a href=\"#bib34\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>). Collectively, these observations suggest that decapping while a prerequisite for mRNA decay is not likely to be rate limiting for decay itself; exonucleolytic digestion by XRN1 is likely to be rate limiting."

Reporter genes are constructed containing the reaper and hid 3' UTR's attached to firefly luciferase. These are stably expressed in <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells that contain the endogenous miRNA's miR-2 and Bantam, which target reaper and hid respectively. The authors show that mutating the miR-2 and Bantam miRNA responsive elements (MREs) in these reporters leads to a substantial stabilization of the reporter transcripts. They find that virtually all of the reporter mRNA and a large fraction of the miRNAs are associated with polysomes. The wild type but not the MRE-mutant mRNAs give rise degradation products that are also associated with polysomes and which are missing sequences from their 5' ends. The authors show that the reaper and hid reporters, as well as the endogenous reaper transcript, but not other endogenous transcripts, produce polysomal deadenylated products. Finally, they show using a 5' ligation assay that the reaper and hid reporter transcripts on polysomes are partially decapped and exo-nucleolytically trimmed from their 5' ends. These data support a model where miRNAs lead to mRNA decay during translation, without a prior step of removing the targets from the pool of actively translating mRNAs."
