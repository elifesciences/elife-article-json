However, the N-terminal domains of CPEBs are distinct and contain specific regulatory post-translational modifications that presumably differentially integrate extracellular signals. Here we show that CPEB4 activity is regulated by ERK2- and Cdk1-mediated hyperphosphorylation. These phosphorylation events additively activate CPEB4 in M-phase by maintaining it in its monomeric state. In contrast, unphosphorylated CPEB4 phase separates into inactive, liquid-like droplets through its intrinsically disordered regions in the N-terminal domain. This dynamic and reversible regulation of CPEB4 is coordinated with that of CPEB1 through Cdk1, which inactivates CPEB1 while activating CPEB4, thereby integrating phase-specific signal transduction pathways to regulate cell cycle progression."

However, the N-terminal domains of CPEBs are distinct and contain specific regulatory post-translational modifications that presumably differentially integrate extracellular signals. Here we show that CPEB4 activity is regulated by ERK2- and Cdk1-mediated hyperphosphorylation. These phosphorylation events additively activate CPEB4 in M-phase by maintaining it in its monomeric state. In contrast, unphosphorylated CPEB4 phase separates into inactive, liquid-like droplets through its intrinsically disordered regions in the N-terminal domain. This dynamic and reversible regulation of CPEB4 is coordinated with that of CPEB1 through Cdk1, which inactivates CPEB1 while activating CPEB4, thereby integrating phase-specific signal transduction pathways to regulate cell cycle progression."

                        "text": "The vertebrate CPE-binding protein (CPEB) family of RNA-binding proteins is composed of four members, with CPEBs 2\u20134 being more closely related to each other than to CPEB1 (reviewed in refs. [<a href=\"#bib16\">Fernandez-Miranda and Mendez, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ivshina et al., 2014</a>]). All four CPEBs share similar C-terminal RNA-binding domains, composed of two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) in tandem, followed by a ZZ domain, which is a zinc-binding domain with a cross-braced zinc binding topology. Consequently, the different CPEBs recognize similar <i>cis</i>-acting cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) on target mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Afroz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Igea and M\u00e9ndez, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Merkel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Novoa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ortiz-Zapater et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pavlopoulos et al., 2011</a>). Although up to 20\u201330% of vertebrate genes are regulated by CPEs, they are not all activated simultaneously. Rather, the CPEs define a combinatorial code, based on their number and distance to the polyadenylation signal (PAS), as well as the presence of additional <i>cis</i>-acting elements, to determine the transcript-specific spatiotemporal translation pattern (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belloc and Mendez, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Eliscovich et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mendez et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pique et al., 2008</a>). The CPE-mediated spatiotemporal patterns of translational control are further determined by the differential regulation of the CPEBs. All four CPEBs have dual functions as translational repressors and translational activators (by promoting cytoplasmic polyadenylation). This duality is differentially regulated for individual CPEB family members through post-translational modifications. Thus, it is plausible that distinct regulatory pathways provide a platform to support translational activation by cytoplasmic polyadenylation in different biological scenarios. At least for CPEB1 and CPEB3, the regulatory elements are localized in the N-terminal domain (NTD), which is highly variable both in length and composition across various CPEB orthologs and paralogs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang and Cooper, 2010</a>). Notably, CPEBs\u2019 NTDs contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDR), which are more extended in CPEB2, CPEB3 and CPEB4. IDR are particularly prevalent in RNA-binding proteins and, over the last years, have been shown to drive the formation of dynamic membraneless organelles (such as P-bodies, germ granules, stress granules and the nucleolus) through phase separation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brangwynne et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Castello et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Patel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nott et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Molliex et al., 2015</a>)."

In prophase I (PI)\u2013arrested <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes, unphosphorylated CPEB1 recruits the deadenylase poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) to inhibit translation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim and Richter, 2006</a>). Upon progesterone stimulation, Aurora kinase A (AurKA) phosphorylates CPEB1 at S174, which remodels CPEB1-mRNP from a repressor to an activator complex, thereby inducing the early wave of cytoplasmic polyadenylation required for the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and MI entry (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barnard et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mendez et al., 2000a</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2000b</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pique et al., 2008</a>). Once the oocytes reach metaphase I (MI), Cdk1 and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) target CPEB1 to ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and this is required to activate the second or \u2018late\u2019 wave of polyadenylation and the MI\u2013MII transition (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mendez et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pique et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Setoyama et al., 2007</a>). In the second meiotic division, a third or \u2018late-late\u2019 wave of polyadenylation is supported by CPEB4, which is synthesized during the early and CPEB1-mediated wave of polyadenylation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belloc and Mendez, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Igea and M\u00e9ndez, 2010</a>). Thus, CPEB4 is only present in the second meiotic division. However, the synthesis of CPEB4 alone is not sufficient to promote cytoplasmic polyadenylation, and progesterone stimulation is still required (<a href=\"#bib34\">Novoa et al., 2010</a>). These observations suggest that CPEB4 is not constitutively active but has to be post-translationally modified to become active. Unlike CPEB1, CPEB4 does not harbour a consensus AurKA phosphorylation site; therefore, it is most likely activated by distinct phosphorylation event(s) during later meiotic phases. Hence, we sought to elucidate the post-translational regulation of CPEB4 that is required for it to support cytoplasmic polyadenylation after CPEB1 has been degraded and to drive the second meiotic division. Unravelling how CPEB4 activity is regulated will contribute to the overall understanding of the CPEB network in mRNA translational control and to defining the phase-specific contributions of individual CPEBs to the unidirectional progression through meiotic and mitotic cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib18\">Giangarra et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Igea and M\u00e9ndez, 2010</a>)."

These phosphorylation events additively activate CPEB4 for cytoplasmic polyadenylation and, consequently, are required for proper meiotic progression. Furthermore, CPEB4 hyperphosphorylation keeps CPEB4 in a monomeric and active state. In contrast, unphosphorylated CPEB4 sequesters CPE-containing mRNAs into inactive, liquid-like droplets formed through intermolecular interactions between residues in CPEB4\u2019s NTD. These results illustrate how phase transitions can be regulated through post-translational modifications and explain how CPEB-specific mechanisms of regulation sustain and coordinate cytoplasmic polyadenylation during cell cycle progression, adapting to the cell signalling transduction pathways activated at each cell cycle phase."

Progression from the PI arrest (stage VI) to MI (shown as germinal vesicle breakdown, GVBD) caused a change in mobility, which was maintained through anaphase/interkinesis (GVBD\u00a0+\u00a01 hr) and in the MII arrest (MII). This mobility shift was abrogated by treatment with lambda-phosphatase, indicating that xCPEB4 was phosphorylated in response to progesterone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To further define the xCPEB4 region(s) phosphorylated in a cell-specific manner, we subdivided xCPEB4 into four fragments, with three (1\u20133) comprising sections of its NTD and the fourth comprising the whole RNA-binding domain (RBD) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). <i>In vitro</i> phosphorylation of full-length (FL) xCPEB4 or the four xCPEB4 fragments with extracts from MII oocytes indicated that multiple residues were targeted in fragments 1\u20133 but none, or only very few, in the RBD fragment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To further define the phase specificity of the phosphorylation events, we tested each fragment for <i>in vitro</i> phosphorylation with extracts from oocytes collected either prior to progesterone stimulation (PI arrested; VI) or at various times after GBVD, corresponding to MI (GBVD and\u00a0+30 min), anaphase/interkinesis (+60 min and\u00a0+90 min) and MII-arrest (+120 min and\u00a0+150 min) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Neither FL xCPEB4 nor any of the fragments were phosphorylated by PI-arrested oocyte extracts. FL xCPEB4 and fragment 1 were phosphorylated in MI and remained phosphorylated throughout the subsequent cell cycle phases. In contrast, fragment 3 was differentially phosphorylated by the extracts from the distinct meiotic phases, following the characteristic kinetics of Cdk1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mendez et al., 2002</a>), as shown by the phosphorylation of histone H1. The phosphorylation kinetics of fragment 2 was intermediate between fragments 1 and 3. In sum, these results indicate that xCPEB4 is phosphorylated at multiple residues in its NTD by distinct kinases that are differentially active during meiotic progression, one of which is most likely Cdk1."

All these kinases are active in MII (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tunquist and Maller, 2003</a>) (for Cdks and ERK, Cdk1 and ERK2 are the active kinases in MI and MII). Phosphorylation of the FL protein was strongly inhibited by FR180204, partially inhibited by roscovitine and BI-2536, and unaffected by SL0101 and U0126, suggesting that ERK2, Cdk1 and Plk1, but not MEK or p90Rsk, target xCPEB4. Phosphorylation of fragments 1 and 2 was specifically inhibited by FR180204, whereas that of fragment 3 was more sensitive to roscovitine, suggesting that ERK2 and Cdk1 target specific regions of the xCPEB4 NTD. We further confirmed the role of ERK2 and Cdk1 in xCPEB4 phosphorylation by immunodepleting the kinases from phase-specific meiotic extracts, with the subsequent reduction of xCPEB4 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To determine the number of phosphorylated residues in each fragment, we phosphorylated the fragments 1\u20133 <i>in vitro</i> with extracts from oocytes collected at MI (GVBD), interkinesis (+1 hr) or MII arrest. The phosphorylated fragments were purified, digested and analysed by 2D phosphopeptide mapping (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Fragment 1 yielded four main phosphopeptides (pp 1\u20134), with a weaker one detectable only after a long exposure (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, pp 5). Fragment 2 contained a single phosphopeptide (pp 6), while fragment 3 had six additional phosphopeptides (pp 7\u201312). These phosphopeptide patterns were qualitatively maintained from MI to MII (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We then compared these 2D phosphopeptide maps with those obtained using recombinant ERK2 or Cdk1/cyclin B (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). ERK2 generated pp 1\u20136 and pp 10, whereas Cdk1/cyclin B produced pp 1\u20133 (albeit with low efficiency), 8, 9 and 11\u201312. In addition, both purified kinases generated other phosphopeptides not observed after phosphorylation with oocyte extract (marked with an asterisk). The migration of some of the phosphopeptides was consistent with phosphorylation at multiple residues in the same peptide. To determine the identity of these residues, we analysed by mass spectrometry either FL xCPEB4 or N-terminal fragments that had been phosphorylated <i>in vitro</i> with MII oocyte extracts or recombinant ERK2 or Cdk1/cyclin B. A total of twelve phosphorylation sites in the NTD of xCPEB4 were identified, all of which were evolutionarily conserved (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Importantly, xCPEB4 phosphosites S97, S250, S253, T324, S328 and S330 were previously identified as phosphorylated residues in CPEB4 mammalian orthologs by high-throughput mass spectrometry screenings (PhosphoSitePlus; <a href=\"http://www.phosphosite.org\">http://www.phosphosite.org</a>)."

                                "text": "To confirm that the phosphopeptides detected by 2D phosphopeptide mapping corresponded to the identified phosphosites, we generated a mutant version of the three N-terminal fragments by converting the serine/threonine residue to aspartic acid at the indicated sites, producing fragment 1 (S18/38/40/97D), fragment 2 (S250/253D) and fragment 3 (T324/S328/330/351/357/362D). These mutated fragments were phosphorylated with MII extracts or recombinant ERK2 or Cdk1/cyclin B (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>). Based on the resulting 2D phosphopeptide maps, we determined that most of the xCPEB4 phosphorylation sites had been identified. However, the mutated xCPEB4 fragments still contained three phosphorylation sites, corresponding to pp 1, 2 and 7, that were not detected in the mass spectrometry analysis. Accordingly, mutation of the 12 identified residues to alanine (12A) did not abolished the slower migration of xCPEB4 expressed in MII oocytes (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). Thus, we conclude that xCPEB4 is phosphorylated in at least 12 sites, which most likely correspond to ERK2-mediated (S18/38/40/97/250/253/351) and Cdk1-mediated (T324/S328/330/357/362) target residues.

For this purpose, we followed the polyadenylation of a radioactive <i>Emi2</i> 3\u2032-UTR probe microinjected into oocytes. Due to its arrangement of CPEs and the presence of AU-rich elements (AREs), <i>Emi2</i> mRNA is polyadenylated in the third (late-late) wave of cytoplasmic polyadenylation that takes place in interkinesis and MII (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belloc and Mendez, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pique et al., 2008</a>) and which is supported by xCPEB4 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Igea and M\u00e9ndez, 2010</a>). In this assay, overexpression of active or activatable xCPEB4 functionally replaces the endogenous xCPEB4 and therefore sustains <i>Emi2</i> mRNA polyadenylation, whereas a non-activatable CPEB4 variant reaches a competitive equilibrium with the endogenous protein, shortening the poly(A) tail of the target mRNA (<a href=\"#bib1\">Afroz et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Mutation of all 12 xCPEB4 phosphorylated residues to alanine (12A) not only inactivated the protein, abolishing its capacity to support cytoplasmic polyadenylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) but was also a better competitor of polyadenylation than a truncated variant of xCPEB4 lacking the NTD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), suggesting that the 12A mutant promotes poly(A) tail shortening. The mutant 12Am, an xCPEB4 phospho-null mutant that additionally cannot bind RNA (with mutations at Y490A and K595A), did not influence competition for polyadenylation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Afroz et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), indicating that the competition effect requires RNA binding. In contrast, a phospho-mimetic xCPEB4 variant (12D), in which all the phosphosites were mutated to aspartic acid, was even less competitive than the WT xCPEB4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that this mutant is constitutively active. xCPEB4 mutants in which only the seven ERK2 phosphorylation sites (7A) or the five Cdk1 phosphorylation sites (5A) were mutated to alanine showed partial and additive effects, indicating that these two kinases contribute equally to the activation of xCPEB4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Other partial mutations (10A and 8A; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) also showed a partial and additive effect for the combined accumulation of mutations, indicating that all 12 phosphorylation events, mediated by the two kinases, are equally important to fully activate xCPEB4, and that a minimum of 10 phosphosites are required. Compared to 12Am, the wild-type CPEB4 (WT) was slightly competitive with endogenous CPEB4 protein, most likely due to inefficient activation or recruitment of co-factors. For this experiment, xCPEB4 variants were expressed from an mRNA where CPEB4-3\u2019UTR was substituted by a non-CPE regulated 3\u2019-UTR, allowing the mutant expression to scape the cell cycle regulation of endogenous CPEB4."

Oocytes depleted of xCPEB4 completed the first meiotic division normally but failed to properly assemble chromosomes into a single metaphase plate in MII, displaying scattered chromosomes as compared to control oocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Nevertheless, xCPEB4-depleted oocytes were able to properly extrude the polar body, indicating that the first meiotic division was completed successfully. Furthermore, xCPEB4 depleted oocytes failed to properly polyadenylate <i>Emi2</i> mRNA in the second meiotic division (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). We next overexpressed xCPEB4, using WT and phosphorylation mutants under the control of xCPEB4 3\u2032-UTR, in xCPEB4-depleted oocytes. The WT and 12D xCPEB4 forms, but not the 12A mutant, rescued chromosomal assembly in the MII metaphase plate, as well as <i>Emi2</i> polyadenylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Consistent with the observation that the 5A and 7A mutants were partially competitive for polyadenylation (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), only the fully phosphorylated xCPEB4 was able to rescue the MII meiotic arrest (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, we conclude that ERK2 and Cdk1 phosphorylate and activate xCPEB4 in the 12 identified sites in order to sustain cytoplasmic polyadenylation in the second meiotic division."

We overexpressed HA-tagged 12A (phospho-null) and 12D (phospho-mimetic) xCPEB4 mutants in oocytes and, after progesterone stimulation, analysed the co-immunoprecipitated proteins by SDS silver staining and mass spectrometry. Most of the identified interacting proteins were enriched for both mutants, with some exceptions, such as chaperones (Hspd1) and RNA helicases (Ddx1 and Ddx20), which were present only in the 12A immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). We specifically tested whether the two mutants could still recruit GLD2, the cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase directly responsible for poly(A) tail elongation. Again, we did not detect any differences between the phospho-mimetic and the phospho-null xCPEB4 mutants (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>)."

                                "text": "We next addressed whether phosphorylation of xCPEB4 causes changes in its subcellular localization that could explain the differences in its activity. We overexpressed FL or NTD GFP-tagged xCPEB4 constructs, using either the wild-type or the 12A and 12D mutants for each, in U2OS cells. GFP and the GFP-xCPEB4 RNA-binding domain (RBD) were used as controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Both WT and 12A GFP-xCPEB4 phase-separated into cytoplasmic spherical granules when expressed in U2OS cells. In contrast, the 12D mutant exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic distribution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>). The WT, 12A and 12D xCPEB4 NTDs expressed in U2OS cells distributed in patterns similar to their corresponding FL variants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>). The controls, of either GFP alone or the GFP-xCPEB4 RBD, exhibited diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution, suggesting that the RBD does not contribute to the granular distribution of xCPEB4. The analysed cells showed equivalent fluorescence intensities (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>), implying that the differential ability to phase separate is not a consequence of distinct protein concentration. These results indicate that, when non-phosphorylated, the intrinsically disordered NTD of xCPEB4 phase separates into large assemblies in non-mitotic cells. Co-staining of P-bodies and stress granule markers (4E-T and DDX6; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) showed no clear co-localization of these with xCPEB4. Thus, although CPEB4 re-localizes to stress granules in response to arsenite (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chang and Huang, 2014</a>), inactive xCPEB4 in non-stressed cells forms cytoplasmic granules that differ from P-bodies or stress granules. To better characterize the nature of these assemblies, we performed FRAP experiments with FL or NTD GFP-xCPEB4. We determined a half-time of maximum recovery (Half Max) of 1.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11 s for FL GFP-xCPEB4 and of 0.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 s for the NTD (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These fast recovery rates indicate that the molecules forming the granules had a liquid-like behaviour and were in constant exchange with the surrounding cytoplasm. This feature, together with the spherical shape of the granules and the fact that we could observe fusion events over time (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), suggests that xCPEB4 is able to phase separate into liquid-like droplets. The difference in recovery between the FL and the NTD forms indicates that the RBD of xCPEB4, and most probably the bound mRNA, are not required for the self-assembly but influence the dynamics of these droplets."

                                "text": "We next sought to determine whether the phospho-dependent transition between the liquid-like droplet state and the monomeric active state of CPEB4 occurs endogenously. During meiosis, xCPEB4 accumulates in MII, during which ERK2 and Cdk1 are already active; consequently, xCPEB4 only exists in a phosphorylated active state. Thus, to evaluate the transition between the liquid-like droplet state and the monomeric active state of endogenous CPEB4, we studied human CPEB4 (hCPEB4) during the mitotic cell cycle in U2OS cells (hCPEB4 and xCPEB4 share 93% of identity and the identified phosphorylation sites are conserved). To this end, cells were synchronized in mitosis (with nocodazole or RO-3306) and selected by mitotic shake-off. As in meiosis, endogenous hCPEB4 presented a mobility shift in M-phase that disappeared upon lambda-phosphatase treatment, indicating that hCPEB4, like xCPEB4, is phosphorylated in M-phase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To assess if this phosphorylation reflected the transit from the liquid-like droplet state to the monomeric state, we first detected endogenous hCPEB4, in mitotic and non-mitotic cells, by immunofluorescence. Even though it did appear that in mitotic cells the distribution of hCPEB4 was more diffuse than in G1 cells, the change in size/shape of mitotic cells, as well as the increase of hCPEB4 levels during mitosis, made it difficult to quantify the distribution of hCPEB4 along the cell cycle phases (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To avoid these limitations, we analysed the formation of hCPEB4 assemblies by sedimentation in sucrose gradients. Vinculin was used as a reference control. 75% of unphosphorylated hCPEB4 from asynchronous cells was located in dense sucrose fractions (15\u201323), indicating that CPEB4 is forming large assemblies. In contrast, 84% of phosphorylated hCPEB4 from mitotic cells was located in lighter sucrose fractions (1\u201313), suggesting that it is in a monomeric state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We next analysed the association of known CPEB1-co-factors (PARN, Symplekin, CPSF2 and GLD2) with phosphorylated/monomeric or unphosphorylated/phase-separated CPEB4. First, we tested the distribution of those cofactors along the sucrose gradients (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Symplekin, CPSF2 and GLD2 were found in both dense and light fractions, co-migrating with CPEB4 in both the liquid-like droplet state and the monomeric state. CPEB4 Co-IPs confirmed that Symplekin and CPSF2 interact with phosphorylated and unphosphorylated CPEB4 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), as did GLD2 with xCPEB4 12A and 12D mutants in the oocytes (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These results are consistent with the association of Symplekin, CPSF and GLD2 to both repressor and activator CPEB1-complexes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barnard et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kim and Richter, 2006</a>). However, PARN distribution was restricted to light fractions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), indicating that PARN is not responsible of mRNA deadenylation in CPEB4 liquid-like droplets. We also analysed ribosome association (S6), which despite of being in the dense fractions of the gradients were not part of CPEB4 liquid-like droplets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figuers\u00a06B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7A</a>). Thus, suggesting that CPEB4 liquid-like droplets are not active in translation. Altogether, these results are consistent with the mass spectrometry results (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), indicating that the change in CPEB4 activity upon phosphorylation are linked to its phase-transition and not to the differential recruitment of cofactors."

However, CPEB4 has to be activated before it can sustain polyadenylation in the second meiotic division (<a href=\"#bib34\">Novoa et al., 2010</a>). Our results indicate that CPEB4 activation is driven by ERK2- and Cdk1-mediated hyperphosphorylation of at least 12 residues in the intrinsically disordered NTD. Therefore, the sequential functions of CPEB1 and CPEB4 to drive unidirectional progression through the two meiotic divisions result from two redundant mechanisms that are both translational and post-translational (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Thus, CPEB1 is activated by AurKA upon meiotic resumption from PI arrest (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mendez et al., 2000a</a>), leading to the translation of the mRNAs encoding Mos, cyclin B1 and CPEB4 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Igea and M\u00e9ndez, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pique et al., 2008</a>). This in turn activates the kinases ERK2 and Cdk1, which phosphorylate CPEB4 and allow it to sustain cytoplasmic polyadenylation after MI, when AurKA is inactivated (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pascreau et al., 2008</a>) and PPI (which dephosphorylates CPEB1 S174) expression increases (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belloc and Mendez, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tay et al., 2003</a>). Concomitantly, Cdk1 triggers the degradation of CPEB1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mendez et al., 2002</a>), thus reinforcing the substitution of CPEB1 by CPEB4 for the second meiotic division (<a href=\"#bib20\">Igea and M\u00e9ndez, 2010</a>). Hence, CPEB1 and CPEB4 activities are coordinated, not only because CPEB1 controls the synthesis of CPEB4, but also because the same kinase that triggers the degradation of CPEB1\u2014namely, Cdk1\u2014activates CPEB4."

Instead, CPEB4 phosphorylation controls its phase separation into liquid-like droplets, which are inactive for cytoplasmic polyadenylation and sequester CPE-containing mRNAs. Thence, our data support the idea that it is the phosphorylation-regulated phase-transition itself, and not the differential binding to positive or negative cofactors, what controls CPEB4 function. Interestingly, this correlation between phosphorylation and dissociation of the liquid-like droplets also occurs during the mitotic cell cycle, indicating that this regulation contributes to the CPEB4-dependent and M-phase\u2013specific activation of CPE-regulated mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Giangarra et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Novoa et al., 2010</a>)."

These dynamic, high-density liquid-like droplets are usually formed by repetitive, low-complexity intrinsically disordered regions, which self-assemble in micrometre-sized, near-spherical particles separated spontaneously from aqueous solutions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bah et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nott et al., 2015</a>). Hence, CPEB4 assemblies are structurally and functionally distinct from the more static and inheritable amyloid-like filaments formed by active CPEB3 multimers (<a href=\"#bib19\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, CPEB4 liquid-like droplets are reminiscent of other two-component models for mRNA recruitment to intracellular granules: RBPs bind to mRNA via an RBD and phase separate by the interaction of their low-complexity sequences (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nott et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</a>). The dynamism of these structures renders potential for regulated reversibility. In the case of CPEB4, its hyperphosphorylation results in the dissociation of the liquid-like droplets, most probably through the disruption of electrostatic interactions along its disordered NTD. This mechanism provides a novel example of how phase-transitions driven by disordered regions can be regulated post-translationally (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nott et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Han et al., 2012</a>), and unveils a new mechanism of translational regulation during cell cycle."

Indeed, the regulation of CPEB4 by the additive effect of multisite phosphorylations is reminiscent of the ultrasensitive responses that drive irreversible, discrete phase transitions in meiosis, as exemplified by the switch-like regulation of Cdc25C by Cdk1 hyperphosphorylation. Partial phosphorylation of half of the possible sites already provides the highest ultrasensitivity, which may explain the polyadenylation and cell cycle progression effects of the 12A CPEB4 mutant, although it is also phosphorylated in unidentified residues (reviewed in ref. [<a href=\"#bib17\">Ferrell and Ha, 2014</a>]). Thus, the ultrasensitivity may be driven at least in part by cumulative electrostatic interactions between NTDs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borg et al., 2007</a>)."

Samples were in-gel digested with 0.3 \u03bcg of trypsin (Promega) (fragment 3) or trypsin followed by chymotrypsin (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (full length, fragments 1 and 2). After digestion, peptides were extracted and cleaned up on a homemade Empore C18 column (3 M, St. Paul, MN). Samples were analysed using a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled to an EasyLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific (Proxeon), Odense, Denmark). Peptides were loaded directly onto the analytical column at 1.5\u20132 \u03bcl/min and were separated by reversed-phase chromatography using a 12 cm column with an inner diameter of 75 \u03bcm, packed with 5 \u03bcm C18 particles (Nikkyo Technos Co., Ltd. Japan). Chromatographic gradients started at 97% buffer A and 3% buffer B with a flow rate of 300 nl/min, and gradually increased to 93% buffer A and 7% buffer B in 1 min, and to 65% buffer A/35% buffer B in 60 min. Buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in water. Buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ionization mode with nanospray voltage set at 2.2 kV and source temperature at 250\u00b0C. The instrument was operated in DDA mode and full MS scans with 1 micro scans at a resolution of 60,000 were used over a mass range of m/z 250\u20132000 with detection in the Orbitrap. Auto gain control (AGC) was set to 1E6, dynamic exclusion (60 s) and charge state filtering disqualifying singly charged peptides was activated. In each cycle of DDA analysis, following each survey scan, the top twenty most intense ions with multiple charged ions above a threshold ion count of 5000 were selected for fragmentation at normalized collision energy of 35%. Each sample was injected twice: fragment ion spectra produced via collision-induced dissociation (CID) and via high-energy collision dissociation (HCD). An isolation window of 2.0 m/z, activation time of 0.1 ms and maximum injection time of 100 ms were used. All data were acquired with Xcalibur software v2.2. For data analysis, the Mascot search engine (v2.3, Matrix Science) was used for peptide identification. The data were searched against NCBInr (<i>Xenopus laevis</i>). A precursor ion mass tolerance of 10 ppm at the MS1 level was used. Up to three miscleavages for trypsin were allowed. The fragment ion mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da. Oxidation of methionine, protein acetylation at the N-terminal, and phosphorylation at serine, threonine and tyrosine were defined as variable modifications; whereas carbamidomethylation on cysteines was set as a fix modification. Peptides were filtered using an expectation value [EXPECT] cutoff of 0.1."

After the digestion, samples were dried in the speed-vac and resuspended in 20 \u03bcl of 1% formic acid for LC-MS/MS analysis. Digested peptides were diluted in 1% FA. Samples were loaded into a 180 \u03bcm \u00d7 2 cm C18 Symmetry trap column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) at a flow rate of 15 \u03bcl/min using a nanoAcquity Ultra Performance LCTM chromatographic system (Waters Corp.). Peptides were separated using a C18 analytical column with a 60 min run, comprising three consecutive steps with linear gradients from 1% to 35% B in 60 min, from 35%delete to 50% B in 5 min, and from 50% to 85% B in 3 min, followed by isocratic elution at 85% B in 10 min and stabilization to initial conditions (A = 0.1% FA in water, B = 0.1% FA in CH<sub>3</sub>CN). The column outlet was directly connected to an Advion TriVersa NanoMate (Advion, Ithaca, NY) fitted on an LTQ-FT Ultra mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Up to six of the most intense ions per scan were fragmented and detected in the linear ion trap. Target ions already selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 30 s. Spray voltage in the NanoMate source was set to 1.70 kV. The spectrometer was working in positive polarity mode and singly charge state precursors were rejected for fragmentation. For data analysis, a database search was performed with Proteome Discoverer software v1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the Sequest search engine and SwissProt database (Xenopodinae, release 2013_06 and the common Repository of Adventitious Proteins, cRAP database). Searches were run against targeted and decoy databases to determine the false discovery rate (FDR). Search parameters included trypsin enzyme specificity, allowing for two missed cleavage sites, carbamidomethyl in cysteine as static modification and methionine oxidation, and phosphorylation at serine, threonine and tyrosine as dynamic modifications. Peptide mass tolerance was 10 ppm and the MS/MS tolerance was 0.8 Da. Peptides with a q-value lower than 0.1 and a FDR &lt; 1% were considered as positive identifications with a high confidence level."

Both the sites of phosphorylation as well as the likely kinases involved (Erk2 and Cdk1) are identified by using specific kinase inhibitors together with biochemistry and mass spec analysis. The study goes on to show that phosphorylation of these specific residues are required for efficient polyadenylation activation. The final and arguably most important remaining parts of this study show that CPEB4 NTD when unphosphorylated coalesces into large structures/particles visualised as cytoplasmic bodies.

Also, it is not clear what fraction of the mRNA pool is sequestered in droplets and whether this can explain why the poly(A) tails are not extended. Therefore, this value and the proportion of the total CPEB4 population that is in the liquid droplet state need to be directly measured. In addition, are the interactions with known CPEB4 binding partners affected, as determined, for example, using co-immunoprecipitation with the human protein in human cells? This has been partially addressed for a subset of binding partners. But whether PARN or GLD2 colocalize together with CPEB4 in the droplets has not been investigated and should be.

Based on the very numerous studies dealing with kinase-activities during meiosis, these profiles narrow down the suspected kinases to a very limited number.

However, mRNA-targeting (to deplete the encoded protein) has two relevant technical and conceptual limitations in this case. First, in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes, this approach is only feasible for maternally encoded proteins (like xCPEB4). For proteins that are already present in PI-arrested oocytes (like ERK2 and Cdk1), targeting their mRNAs does no result in reduction of the proteins within the timeframe of the experiments. The second one, and this would apply also to mRNA-targeting in cell cultures, inhibition of ERK2 and Cdk1 in cells/oocytes will block the entry of the cell/oocyte into Metaphase. Because CPEB4 is only phosphorylated in Metaphase, the result of the experiment will be similar to the above-mentioned time-course. It will say that CPEB4 kinases are activated in metaphase but not whether CPEB4 is a direct or indirect target of ERK2 and Cdk1. This is the reason why, in the kinase-inhibitor experiments, first we obtain oocyte extracts synchronized for each meiotic-phase and then treat the extracts with the inhibitors. This approach, with the intrinsic limitations of the specificity of the inhibitors, points to a direct phosphorylation of CPEB4 by the targeted kinase(s)."

In the case of ERK2, which phosphorylates at least 7 residues on xCPEB4 NTD, its immunodepletion results in a 26% further reduction of xCPEB4 phosphorylation, even though ERK2 depletion was not complete.

These three candidates were chosen because they are specifically polyadenylated and activated in mitosis and in a CPEB4 dependent manner (Novoa et al., 2010). Thence, RNA-immunoprecipitation from specific sucrose gradient fractions shows: (i) In asynchronous cells, where the majority of CPEB4 is in the LLD state, 63% of <i>Cdc20</i>, 92% of <i>Spop</i> and 78% of <i>Mnt</i> mRNAs bound to CPEB4 are bound by CPEB4 in the LLD state (dense fractions).

These results show that both physical states of CPEB4 are equally able to bind target mRNAs. We conclude that when CPEB4 is not phosphorylated its target mRNAs are majorly bound by the LLDs, while upon phosphorylation these target mRNAs are bound by monomeric CPEB4.
