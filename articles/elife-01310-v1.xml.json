Using a genetic model to rapidly inhibit Zap70 catalytic activity we examined synapse formation between cytotoxic T lymphocytes and their targets. In the absence of Zap70 catalytic activity Vav-1 activation occurs and synapse formation is arrested at a stage with actin and integrin rich interdigitations forming the interface between the two cells. The membranes at the synapse are unable to flatten to provide extended contact, and Lck does not cluster to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC). Centrosome polarisation is initiated but aborts before reaching the synapse and the granules do not polarise. Our findings reveal distinct roles for Zap70 as a structural protein regulating integrin-mediated control of actin vs its catalytic activity that regulates TCR-mediated control of actin and membrane remodelling during formation of the immunological synapse."

Using a genetic model to rapidly inhibit Zap70 catalytic activity we examined synapse formation between cytotoxic T lymphocytes and their targets. In the absence of Zap70 catalytic activity Vav-1 activation occurs and synapse formation is arrested at a stage with actin and integrin rich interdigitations forming the interface between the two cells. The membranes at the synapse are unable to flatten to provide extended contact, and Lck does not cluster to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC). Centrosome polarisation is initiated but aborts before reaching the synapse and the granules do not polarise. Our findings reveal distinct roles for Zap70 as a structural protein regulating integrin-mediated control of actin vs its catalytic activity that regulates TCR-mediated control of actin and membrane remodelling during formation of the immunological synapse."

When Zap70 was switched off, integrins were still activated but the formation of the immunological synapse was halted with only finger-tip-like contacts between the T cell and the target cell. These contacts were formed by projections from the T cell made of a protein called actin, which forms a kind of scaffolding within cells. Without active Zap70, the T cell receptors could not trigger the dynamic rearrangement of the actin proteins and the membrane remodelling required to form a tight contact between the two cells. This disrupted the delivery of the cytotoxic proteins to their target. These results clearly show that Zap70 has at least two distinct roles that it must carry out for an immunological synapse to form."

The mature synapse forms over several minutes and is segregated into three concentric regions, called the central, peripheral and distal supramolecular activation complexes (SMACs) (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib29\">Jenkins and Griffiths (2010)</a>). The regions can be distinguished by the differential localization of molecules. For instance, Lck and PKC-\u03b8 cluster with the TCR within the central SMAC (cSMAC), while integrins and associated talin are excluded centrally but accumulate at the peripheral SMAC (pSMAC) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Monks et al., 1998</a>) and actin clusters within the distal SMAC (dSMAC). In secretory synapses, formed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), secretion occurs into a small secretory cleft next to the cSMAC and within the pSMAC (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stinchcombe et al., 2001b</a>). The membranes around the secretory cleft are very tightly opposed around the area where cytotoxic proteins are secreted. Exactly how this organisation of membranes is set up as CTL and target cells interact is not known."

Zap70 acts as a critical effector of downstream signalling after initial engagement of TCR. Loss of <i>Zap70</i> in humans leads to Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) characterized by the absence of CD8 T cells and the presence of non-functional CD4 T cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arpaia et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chan et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Elder et al., 1994</a>).

This analog-sensitive Zap70 protein [Zap70(AS)] has a methionine to alanine substitution in its catalytic site which allows it to accommodate the bulky ATP-competitive inhibitor, 3-MB-PP1, which impairs Zap70(AS) catalytic function but has little effect on wild-type Zap70. This model, with Zap70(AS) controlled by the addition of a rapidly acting small molecule inhibitor that is genetically selective, has opened the way to studying the role of Zap70 in functional mature T cells. Importantly, this system is able to distinguish the roles played by the catalytic activity of Zap70 as opposed to its structural contributions since the inhibited kinase is present, associates with the TCR, is tyrosine phosphorylated by Lck and has the capacity to recruit other signalling molecules."

Inhibition of Zap70(AS) does not affect its phosphorylation by the upstream kinase, Lck, nor does it affect the catalytic activity of T cells expressing wild-type Zap70. Intriguingly, studies of CD4 T cells revealed that Zap70 catalytic activity was not required for integrin activation, but rather that Zap70 plays a catalytic-independent role in integrin activation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Au-Yeung et al., 2010</a>). The Zap70(AS) model therefore provides an unprecedented opportunity for examining the role of integrin vs TCR mediated events during the formation of the immunological synapse as TCR activation is required for integrin activation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burbach et al., 2007</a>). This is particularly interesting since integrin activation alone has been shown to trigger polarisation of both centrosome and secretory granules to the immunological synapse in Natural Killer (NK) cells; although both activating receptor and integrin activation are required for degranulation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bryceson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">March and Long, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bryceson et al., 2009</a>) as well as remodelling of synaptic actin required for cytokine secretion (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 2012</a>).

Zap70-inactive CTL were able to bind and form conjugates with target cells almost as well as Zap70-active CTL, with 60% of Zap70(AS) CTL (n = 70) forming conjugates in the presence of 3-MB-PP1 compared with 67% (n = 60) without inhibitor.

Therefore, given the loss of talin clearance, immunofluorescence microscopy was used to examine the ability of CTL-P815 conjugates to clear actin and form the distal SMAC (dSMAC) in the absence of ZAP activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Conjugates were scored based on the phenotypes of total actin clearance, partial, or no clearance from the synapse as described in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The majority of conjugates formed with Zap70-active CTL accumulate actin at the contact site, which clears into a ring of actin at the dSMAC of the synapse (76.5%, n = 65) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, black) consistent with other studies of CTL (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tsun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zhao et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, when CTL lack Zap70 catalytic activity, they lose this ability, and the proportion of conjugates displaying clearance drops to 26% (n = 83) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). When actin clearance is examined in conjugates which do not display a cSMAC (75%, n = 83), the effect is even more pronounced, with 91.5% of conjugates failing to clear actin. Interestingly, accumulation of actin at the synapse was still observed in the absence of Zap70 activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These results reveal that actin accumulates across the synapse in the absence of Zap70 catalytic activity, but fails to clear to form the outer ring or dSMAC. Moreover, cSMAC formation is impaired in the absence of actin clearance."

To determine how the inhibition of Zap70 catalytic activity affects downstream signalling including ERK phosphorylation in CTL, we performed western blot analysis of <i>Zap70+/\u2212</i> and Zap70(AS) CTL lysates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Inhibition of Zap70 catalytic activity does not impair its capacity to be phosphorylated on tyrosine 319, which is inducibly phosphorylated upon CD3 crosslinking, and remains similarly phosphorylated in the presence of a high concentration of 3-MB-PP1 (10 \u03bcM). This result is consistent with Zap70 as a substrate of the upstream Src kinase Lck. However, the phosphorylation of LAT, a substrate of Zap70, as well as PLC\u03b3 and ERK all depend on Zap70 catalytic activity. These results suggest a signalling pathway from Zap70 via the LAT signalosome and PLC\u03b3 is required for activation of ERK in CTL. It has also been reported that a PI3K-dependent pathway is required for activating ERK and CTL degranulation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Robertson et al., 2005</a>). To determine whether this pathway may also be dependent on Zap70 activity we probed for phosphorylation of AKT, which is activated downstream of PI3K. Indeed, Akt phosphorylation was sensitive to Zap70 inhibition, suggesting that ERK is activated downstream of Zap70 through a LAT and PLC\u03b3 pathway or alternatively through a pathway that also includes AKT."

This was of particular interest because Vav-1 has been shown to play an important role in both TCR- and integrin-mediated activation of actin reorganisation in T cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">del Pozo et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">Garcia-Bernal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tybulewicz, 2005</a>). We found that TCR activation triggers Vav-1 phosphorylation independently of Zap70 kinase activity, with Vav-1 phosphorylation occurring in both <i>Zap70+/\u2212</i> and Zap70(AS) CTL lysates from cells treated with 3-MB-PP1, both for overall Vav-1 phosphorylation as well as at Y160, a site that is selectively phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation or \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-mediated activation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gao et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Miletic et al., 2006</a>). Only a slight decrease in Vav1 phosphorylation is evident in Zap70(AS) CTL with 10 \u03bcM 3MB-PP1 suggesting Zap70 catalytic function makes only a minimal contribution to Vav-1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These results suggest that Vav-1 phosphorylation, and presumably its GEF activation, occurs independently of Zap70 catalytic activity, while the pathway leading to ERK and PI3K activation are dependent on Zap70 catalytic activity. This supports the idea that integrin activation occurs in CTL in which Zap70 is catalytically inhibited, as previously observed in Treg (<a href=\"#bib3\">Au-Yeung et al., 2010</a>)."

Adherence to an ICAM-1 coated plate was measured before and after TCR activation using anti-CD3\u03b5 for 10 min. TCR activation increased the percentage of CTL binding to ICAM-1 from 20% to 30% for <i>Zap70</i>+/\u2212 and from 16% to 34% for Zap70 (AS) CTL. 3-MB-PP1 treatment resulted in 32% binding for <i>Zap70</i>+/\u2212 and 25% for Zap70 (AS) CTL (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While there does appear to be some reduction in CTL adhesion upon 3-MB-PP1 treatment, these data also suggest there is residual Zap70 catalytic-independent integrin function. We also examined the level of integrin activation by determining the speed of CTL movement using live cell imaging. We found no difference in the speed of movement on an ICAM-1 surface with CTL moving with an average speed of 9 \u03bcm/min when Zap70 was catalytically active or inactive (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1 and 2</a>; n&gt;84 each). These results support the idea that Zap70 catalytic activity is not required for integrin activation in CTL.

While earlier studies revealed that target cell killing was inhibited in the absence of Zap70 activity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Au-Yeung et al., 2010</a>), the underlying mechanisms for the loss of cytotoxicity were not investigated. We find that in the absence of Zap70 catalytic activity formation of the immunological synapse is arrested at a stage where actin-rich interdigitations dominate the interface between the two cells, with actin accumulated across the synapse and TCR unable to coalesce to form a cSMAC. The membranes between CTL and target are unable to flatten to provide an extended area of contact and the secretory cleft does not form. Signalling downstream of Zap70 is disrupted and neither centrosome nor granules polarise. Our studies provide the first insights into the membrane reorganisations that accompany actin remodelling to form the mature immunological synapse."

Previous studies using Zap70(AS) CD4 cells demonstrated that although addition of 3-MB-PP1 inhibits phosphorylation of LAT and ERK, Zap70 itself can still be phosphorylated and take part in signalling. We see the same picture in CD8 CTL. Furthermore we show that phosphorylation of PLC\u03b3, ERK and AKT are all dependent on Zap70 catalytic activity, suggesting that the LAT signalosome and PLC\u03b3 are required for ERK activation in CTL, providing a rationale for previous observations implicating both ERK (<a href=\"#bib44\">Robertson et al., 2005</a>) and PLC\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Le Floc\u2019h et al., 2011</a>) in CTL-mediated killing. We also find that catalytically inactive Zap70 can itself be phosphorylated in CTL, supporting a kinase-independent scaffolding role for Zap70 in TCR regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion as reported in Treg cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Au-Yeung et al., 2010</a>). These results support the idea that the initial stages of synapse formation, during which there is an accumulation of actin across the synapse, may well be integrin mediated. Consistent with this is our finding that Vav-1 phosphorylation mediated by the TCR, and possibly involving integrins (<a href=\"#bib43\">Riteau et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Garcia-Bernal et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">2009</a>), appears to be independent of Zap70 catalytic activity, with Y160 phosphorylation occurring in Zap70 catalytically inactive CTL. Although earlier studies have implicated Zap70 in the activation of Vav-1 both in vivo (<a href=\"#bib18\">Deckert et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kadlecek et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Michel et al., 1998</a>) and in vitro (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brunati et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Han et al., 1998</a>), our present study shows phosphorylation of Vav-1 in the absence of Zap-70 catalytic activity, likely mediated by Lck."

Although centrosome polarisation is initiated in CTL lacking Zap70 activity, it is aborted before reaching the synapse, and granule polarisation does not take place. These results suggest an underlying difference in the mechanism of polarisation that may reflect the different roles played by NK and CTL in recognising and destroying virally infected and tumour cells."

We find that both the integrin-associated talin, as well as actin, accumulate across the immunological synapse, but do not clear to form the concentric pSMAC and dSMAC actin rings characteristic of the synapse. Lck, the kinase that phosphorylates and activates Zap70 and is a marker of the cSMAC, fails to cluster to form a cSMAC. This observation fits with previous observations on P116 Jurkat cells lacking Zap70, which failed to cluster PKC\u03b8 and LAT at the synapse (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blanchard et al., 2002</a>). Our results suggest that the loss of cSMAC formation arises from a failure of actin to clear from the synapse. Actin has been proposed to act as a \u2018picket fence\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Morone et al., 2006</a>), impeding the movement of proteins laterally within the membrane and an increased density of actin across the synapse might therefore disrupt cSMAC formation by impeding the movement of TCR. In keeping with this model inhibition of actin reorganisation with jasplakinolide on planar lipid bilayers prevents cSMAC formation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beemiller et al., 2012</a>) as well as with earlier observations that actin dynamics are required for effective TCR signalling stemming either from the use of actin inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib58\">Valitutti et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Delon et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tskvitaria-Fuller et al., 2003</a>) or depletion of actin regulatory proteins such as dynamin 2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gomez et al., 2005</a>), or ezrin (<a href=\"#bib45\">Roumier et al., 2001</a>), all of which inhibit T cell activation. However our results reveal a much more profound disruption of the whole contact site with actin rich protrusions providing very few points of contact for receptor interactions between the two cells which would impair TCR coalescence to form the cSMAC."

Consistent with our observations, Ueda et al noted \u2018invasive pseudopodia\u2019 forming interdigitations between CD4 T cells and B cells at early stages of interaction (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ueda et al., 2011</a>)."

The secretory cleft is also notably absent from synapses formed by Zap70 catalytically-inactive CTL. Although one possible explanation for loss of the secretory cleft, into which granules secrete their content, could be that this cleft results as a loss of secretion from these cells, this seems highly unlikely as the cleft forms properly in synapses made by secretion-deficient CTL lacking Rab27a or Munc13-4 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Stinchcombe et al., 2001a</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">2004</a>). The very striking loss of the cleft structure in synapses formed by Zap70 inactive CTL demonstrates that cleft formation requires Zap70 activity."

With the loss of centrosome migration, the lytic granules remain dispersed within Zap70 inactive CTL, do not polarise to the synapse and the target cell is not killed. Previous studies with CTL lacking Lck showed that the centrosome was able to polarise around the nucleus towards the synapse, but was unable to dock at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tsun et al., 2011</a>). Since live cell imaging was not used to examine centrosome polarisation in Lck-deficient CTL, a direct comparison is not possible. Interestingly actin and talin clearance from the synapse were also impaired in Lck-deficient CTL."

Integrin-mediated actin dynamics proceed normally in Zap-inactive CTL. Not only is Vav-1 phosphorylated, but actin accumulates at the synapse and our live cell studies show that actin reorganisation required for integrin-mediated motility is unimpaired in the absence of Zap70 activity. The loss of Zap70 catalytic activity does not affect the integrin driven accumulation of actin at the synapse, but results in loss of actin reorganisation once the synapse has formed."

It is interesting to note that the only points of contact between CTL and target are at the tips of the interdigitations, and TCR proteins localised to these tips would appear as microclusters. When Zap70 is catalytically active actin clears centrally, the membranes flatten into an extended area of contact and TCR microclusters coalesce to form the cSMAC. Our data are consistent with studies showing that actin clearance is required for the coalescence of microclusters to form the cSMAC (<a href=\"#bib14\">Campi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Babich et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Beemiller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yi et al., 2012</a>) and we propose that this marks a transition from a highly interdigitated to a flattened interface between the two cells."

We find that, unlike NK cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bryceson et al., 2005</a>), CTL are unable to polarise their centrosome and granules in response to integrin activation alone. Our findings also reveal a surprising new role for Zap70 in controlling the reorganisation of membranes to form the interface at the immunological synapse, including the cSMAC and secretory cleft. Without these rearrangements, the synapse is not functional. Our findings point to distinct roles played by Zap70 as a structural protein regulating integrin-mediated control of actin vs the role of it\u2019s catalytic subunit controlling TCR mediated control of actin and membrane remodelling during formation of the immunological synapse."

The authors use the Zap70(AS) mouse whose T cells express a modified form of Zap70 that can be catalytically inactivated upon addition of the chemical 3-MB-PP1. This genetically modified model, described by two of the manuscript co-authors in 2010, allows distinction between T cell functions that require Zap70 as a scaffold protein and others that need its enzymatic activity. Previous experiments using this model showed that Zap70 plays a kinase-independent role in integrin activation upon CD4+ T cell activation, providing a unique system to distinguish between integrin-dependent/TCR-independent and /TCR-dependent events. In the present study, the authors use CTLs generated from Zap70(AS) mice to characterize the role of integrins versus the TCR in synapse formation and function. Overall, the manuscript is clearly written and the results are very clear-cut and interesting. This manuscript should make an important contribution to the field if the authors address the few concerns raised below:"

However, the quality of their study would be greatly improved if they could further quantify their images using non-biased image analysis software.

For example: why do they count the number of polarized cells rather than measure the distance between their centrosome and the synapse? This measure could be indicative of the mechanisms involved in Zap70 kinase-dependent regulation of centrosome polarization."

Yet, this assumption, which is widely adopted in the Discussion, does not rely on experimental data showing that integrin activation is normal in CTL from Zap70(AS) mice treated with 3-MB-PP1. Besides, the movies that have been performed on ICAM-1 coated slides (unlike the fixed microscopy that was performed on uncoated slides) suggest that treated CTL do not migrate the same way on ICAM-1 alone. This would corroborate the results published by N. Hogg's group (The integrin LFA-1 signals through Zap70 to regulate expression of high-affinity LFA-1 on T lymphocytes. Evans R, Lellouch AC, Svensson L, McDowall A, Hogg N. Blood. 2011 Mar 24;117(12):3331-42. Not cited by the authors), which show that ZAP70 kinase activity controls the speed of migration of T cells on ICAM-1 as well as their firm adhesion. Thus another interpretation of the data is the following: Zap70 kinase activity controls LFA1 activation in T cells and firm adhesion of CTL to targets. In the absence of LFA1 activation remodeling of actin at the synapse does not take place as shown in NK cells by Brown AC and co-workers (Super-resolution imaging of remodeled synaptic actin reveals different synergies between NK cell receptors and integrins. Brown AC, Dobbie IM, Alakoskela JM, Davis I, Davis DM. Blood. 2012 Nov 1;120(18):3729-40. Not cited by the authors)."

Our results therefore differ from previous studies using piceatannol to inhibit Zap70 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Evans et al 2011</a>). At the concentration used in those studies, piceatannol can potentially inhibit catalytic activity, by 50% or more, of at least 15 out of 110 kinases tested (<a href=\"http://www.kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/screening-compounds/345911\">http://www.kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/screening-compounds/345911</a>).

This allowed us to follow centrosome polarization in 50 movies from CTL with and without Zap70 catalytic activity (<a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3 and 4</a>). This revealed that the centrosome does begin to polarize in Zap70 catalytically inactive CTL approaching to within 3-5 \u03bcm of the synapse, but then aborts.
