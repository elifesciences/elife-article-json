Since defects in the O-mannosylation protein glycosylation pathway are primarily responsible for dystroglycanopathies and with no established O-mannose initiated structures containing a \u03b23 linked GlcNAc known, we biochemically interrogated this human enzyme. Here we report this enzyme is not a \u03b2-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase with catalytic activity towards \u03b2-galactose but rather a \u03b2-1,4-glucuronyltransferase, designated B4GAT1, towards both \u03b1- and \u03b2-anomers of xylose. The dual-activity LARGE enzyme is capable of extending products of B4GAT1 and we provide experimental evidence that B4GAT1 is the priming enzyme for LARGE. Our results further define the functional O-mannosylated glycan structure and indicate that B4GAT1 is involved in the initiation of the LARGE-dependent repeating disaccharide that is necessary for extracellular matrix protein binding to O-mannosylated \u03b1-dystroglycan that is lacking in secondary dystroglycanopathies."

Since defects in the O-mannosylation protein glycosylation pathway are primarily responsible for dystroglycanopathies and with no established O-mannose initiated structures containing a \u03b23 linked GlcNAc known, we biochemically interrogated this human enzyme. Here we report this enzyme is not a \u03b2-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase with catalytic activity towards \u03b2-galactose but rather a \u03b2-1,4-glucuronyltransferase, designated B4GAT1, towards both \u03b1- and \u03b2-anomers of xylose. The dual-activity LARGE enzyme is capable of extending products of B4GAT1 and we provide experimental evidence that B4GAT1 is the priming enzyme for LARGE. Our results further define the functional O-mannosylated glycan structure and indicate that B4GAT1 is involved in the initiation of the LARGE-dependent repeating disaccharide that is necessary for extracellular matrix protein binding to O-mannosylated \u03b1-dystroglycan that is lacking in secondary dystroglycanopathies."

Poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains consist of the repeating disaccharide -\u03b23-GlcNAc-\u03b24-Gal-, a structure termed the i-antigen when unbranched (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ujita et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zhou, 2003</a>). Poly-N-acetyllactosamine is a prevalent glycan substructure found in N-glycans and O-glycans on proteins whose abnormal levels have been associated with human diseases including cancer (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ujita et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zhou, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ho et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). The Fukuda group used an expression cloning strategy enriching for plasmids containing cDNA inserts that substantially increased poly-N-acetyllactosamine, as judged by antibody binding, on the surfaces of Namalwa KJM-1 cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sasaki et al., 1997</a>). Shortly thereafter, work carried out by Hennet's and Sasaki's groups led to the cloning of three other \u03b2-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, B3GNT2, 3, and 4 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shiraishi et al., 2001</a>). However, papers as recently as 2008 continued to use conflicting nomenclature for B3GNT2 by calling it B3GNT1 causing some confusion within the field (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biellmann et al., 2008</a>). Importantly, B3GNT2, B3GNT3 and B3GNT4 were found to share motifs with \u03b23-galactosyl-transferases as well as \u03b23-GalNAc-transferases (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shiraishi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Togayachi et al., 2006</a>). These three enzymes are in the same Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes database (CAZy) family and group together based on primary sequence similarity and motifs hypothesized to play a role in forming the \u03b23 linkage (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shiraishi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Togayachi et al., 2006</a>). B3GNT1 lacks these motifs and is in a different CaZY family, interestingly one shared with LARGE and LARGE2 that contain both xylosyl- and glucoronsyl\u2013transferase activity and which functionally modify O-mannosylated glycans (<a href=\"#bib18\">Inamori et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Goddeeris et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Inamori et al., 2013</a>).

Here we report that B3GNT1 is in fact B4GAT1 (\u03b2-1,4-glucuronyltransferase 1) that generates the substrate for the LARGE-dependent repeating disaccharide that is required for interaction of O-mannosylated \u03b1-dystroglycan with extracellular matrix proteins."

                        "text": "O-mannosylation of \u03b1-dystroglycan is required for its proper function and when disrupted is a significant cause of a subset of congenital muscular dystrophies referred to as secondary dystroglycanopathies (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barresi and Campbell, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Freeze, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Muntoni et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mercuri and Muntoni, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dobson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wells, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Praissman and Wells, 2014</a>). A phosphorylated O-mannose trisaccharide (core M3, [<a href=\"#bib37\">Praissman and Wells, 2014</a>]) attached to \u03b1-dystroglycan and its extension by LARGE after poorly defined intermediate biosynthetic steps (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) has been shown to be directly involved in the required ECM ligand binding activity (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Inamori et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013</a>). Here, we have established that B4GAT1 is a \u03b2-1,4-glucuronyltransferase, not a B3GNT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), with activity toward monomeric \u03b1- and \u03b2- xylopyranosides (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We have gone on to show that LARGE can extend the resulting products of B4GAT1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Prior reports indicated that B4GAT1 (B3GNT1) activity is necessary for expression of LARGE-dependent functional glycosylation of \u03b1-dystroglycan and that B4GAT1 (B3GNT1) and LARGE form a complex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Buysse et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Czeschik et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shaheen et al., 2013</a>). We were unable to confirm this latter point using our soluble forms of the enzymes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since we have shown that the specific activity and catalytic efficiency of B4GAT1 towards the tested monosaccharide xylosides is greater by more than an order of magnitude compared to LARGE catalysis (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), this suggests that B4GAT1 is an initiating enzyme for LARGE-dependent glycan synthesis. This conclusion is further strengthened by data showing a significant lag in the initial rate for synthesis of or a complete failure to produce polymer in the absence of B4GAT1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). It also appears that B4GAT1 serves exclusively as a priming enzyme since we could not detect B4GAT1 modification of LARGE extended trisaccharides (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). We also demonstrate that neither LARGE nor B4GAT1 is capable of adding GlcA to a disaccharide that has been capped with GlcA suggesting that branching is not occurring (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This leads to the conclusion that there is only one type of repeating disaccharide (Xyl-\u03b13-GlcA-\u03b23) attached to \u03b1-dystroglycan that is synthesized by LARGE. This data also serves to highlight the differences in structural isomers by showing both anomeric configuration (\u03b1 and \u03b2, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C and 6</a>) as well as linkage position (\u22123 and \u22124, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) of isomeric substrates influences their subsequent ability to be elongated by enzymes (LARGE and B4GAT1). In sum, our data provide a basis for further attempts to fully elucidate the functional LARGE-dependent O-mannose-initiated structure(s) and suggests that at least one of the remaining incompletely characterized genes implicated in functional glycosylation of \u03b1-dystroglycan (FKTN, FKRP, ISPD, and TMEM5, [<a href=\"#bib21\">Jae et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wells, 2013</a>]) likely encodes a xylosyltransferase to provide a substrate for B4GAT1. Given that B4GAT1 is essential for proper glycosylation of \u03b1-dystroglycan (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Buysse et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Czeschik et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shaheen et al., 2013</a>) and that LARGE is incapable of transferring GlcA to a \u03b2-xylopyranoside (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, [<a href=\"#bib18\">Inamori et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2013</a>]) or generating a polymer from pNP-\u03b2-Xyl without B4GAT1 present (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), our findings strongly suggest that the underlying xylose is in a \u03b2-linkage on \u03b1-dystroglycan. This work also clarifies why deficiencies in this enzyme would be associated with loss of functional glycosylation and laminin binding of \u03b1-dystroglycan and be causal for congenital muscular dystrophy (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Buysse et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Czeschik et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shaheen et al., 2013</a>). Further, our results likely clarify how loss of expression of B4GAT1 (B3GNT1), similar to loss of expression of LARGE (<a href=\"#bib9\">de Bernabe et al., 2009</a>), can lead to loss of laminin-binding \u03b1-dystroglycan and promote metastasis in certain cancers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bao et al., 2009</a>). Finally, potential complex interactions between poly-N-acetyllactosamine, as often measured by the i-antigen antibody, and the LARGE-dependent repeating disaccharide, often measured on \u03b1-dystroglycan by the IIH6 antibody, need to be reexamined in the context of the newly defined enzymatic activity of B4GAT1 (B3GNT1) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ujita et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wright et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yoneyama et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Buysse et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Czeschik et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shaheen et al., 2013</a>). For example, B4GAT1 has previously been observed to be in complex with B4GALT1, an enzyme required for poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2009</a>). This finding suggested that interaction between these two enzymes, which were thought to generate the repeating disaccharide, potentially influenced poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis. In lieu of our findings, this extrapolated conclusion from the interaction data is no longer valid. Instead, the relationship between poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis and the functional O-mannose glycan pathway needs to be evaluated, especially given that both have been implicated in cancer metastasis (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ujita et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wright et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yoneyama et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Buysse et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Czeschik et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shaheen et al., 2013</a>)."

This designation is following in the tradition of the three other known non-proteoglycan glycoprotein glucuronyltransferases that all add GlcA in a \u03b23-linkage (B3GAT1-3, [<a href=\"#bib31\">Morita et al., 2008</a>]). Interestingly, the only established glycoprotein glycoslytransferases capable of transferring GlcA in a \u03b24-linkage are the dual-activity exostoses enzymes involved in heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan polymerization that build the repeating disaccharide (-GlcNAc-\u03b14-GlcA-\u03b24-) backbone of the glycosaminoglycan (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zak et al., 2002</a>). Similarities exist between HS (and other proteoglycan) biosynthesis pathways and the LARGE-dependent functional O-mannose glycan assembly pathway built on \u03b1-dystroglycan (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Included in these similarities are that they both contain non-reducing end repeating disaccharides (GlcA and GlcNAc for HS and GlcA and Xyl for the functional O-Man structure), they both contain an acidic glycan (GlcA), there is a copolymerase that has dual\u2013enzymatic activity (exostoses enzymes for HS and LARGE for the functional O-Man glycan structure), both require a specific underlying core structure, and each contains specific priming glycosyltransferases (EXTLs for HS [<a href=\"#bib23\">Kitagawa et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2001</a>], B4GAT1 for the functional O-Man glycan structure) that adds one of the sugars found in the repeat to the underlying core structure to initiate elongation. Here we have established that B4GAT1, previously referred to as B3GNT1, is a xylopyranoside \u03b21,4-glucuronyltransferase that appears to be the priming enzyme for the LARGE copolymerase for building the functional O-Man structure on \u03b1-dystroglycan that when defective causes CMD."

Separations were carried out by isocratic elution using a Grace Vydac 218 TP C18 column (5 \u03bcm particle size, 2.1 mm \u00d7 150 mm). All disaccharide products were separated using 14%B. Trisaccharide and tetrasaccharide separations were noted to be most strongly influenced by the identity of the underlying labeled disaccharide. Hence, all longer chain products and substrates extending GlcA-\u03b24-Xyl-\u03b1-pNP were separated at 8%B, all products and substrates extending GlcA-\u03b24-Xyl-\u03b2-MU were separated using 10%B, and all products and substrates extending GlcA-\u03b23-Xyl-\u03b1-pNP were separated at 5%B. LC-MS and LC-MS/MS of reaction products was performed in positive mode on either a Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA) Orbitrap XL or a Thermo Fisher Orbitrap Fusion utilizing short linear gradients from 0.1% formic acid in water to 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile. Full MS was acquired in the Orbitrap for accurate mass determination while glycoside MS/MS fragmentation spectra were obtained in the linear ion trap and assigned manually."

We compared the activity of B4GAT1 to that of LARGE while varying monosaccharide acceptor concentration. Concentrations ranging from 200 nM to 2 mM were tested to generate typical Michaelis\u2013Menten curves for each enzyme against the substrates Xyl-\u03b1-pNP and Xyl-\u03b2-pNP. UDP-GlcA was supplied at 2 mM in all reactions. Reactions were terminated by boiling and processed as described above with quantification by HPLC.

However, specific activity was only reported in the Inamori 2013 manuscript as the other experiments used undefined amounts of enzyme and rarely look at initial rates. The Inamori, et al. 2013 manuscript used a disaccharide for establishing rates due to the low activity observed for monosaccharide as a substrate consistent with our findings. As can be clearly observed in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a> of our manuscript, it is the initial transfer of GlcA to a monomer that appears to be slow and then extension appears to be robustly consistent with the observations of Inamori et al. 2013. Thus, we believe our results are fully consistent with what others have observed though direct comparison is not possible due to undefined reactions and/or different substrates being utilized for establishing kinetic parameters."

To further address the issue of priming and polymer formation, we have included additional experiments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). This new data clearly demonstrates that LARGE alone is not able to form polymer using the Xyl-\u03b2-pNP as substrate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). However, LARGE in the presence of both sugar nucleotides can produce polymer on Xyl-\u03b1- pNP though the initial rate, for the addition of the first GlcA, is quite slow (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Further, the addition of B4GAT1 eliminates this initial lag observed with Xyl- \u03b1-pNP as the substrate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Using the Xyl-\u03b2-pNP, polymer is only observed when both enzymes are present (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Furthermore, we confirmed the presence of polymer formed when both enzymes are used by mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). This data strongly supports the model of B4GAT1 being the priming enzyme for LARGE-dependent polymer formation. Further, when coupled with the similar phenotype observed in patients and animal models with mutations/knock-down of B4GAT1 or LARGE, this data suggests that the underlying xylose on the alpha-dystroglycan structure is most likely in a beta-linkage."

However, in a similar finding to ours, while Bao et al had previously demonstrated that B4GAT1 and LARGE when overexpressed as tagged proteins in cells together could co-immunopurify, they demonstrated that mixing of two cell extracts each overexpressing one of the proteins did not result in complex formation (Bao, X et al, 2009, PNAS, 106:12109).

Of course, the oligosaccharyl transferase is a known multi-protein complex in the ER responsible for en bloc transfer of glycans from lipid linked oligosaccharides to Asn residues on proteins serving as a proof-of-concept for this model. Furthermore, a recent publication (Babu et al, 2012, Nature, 489:585) clearly established that there are multiple membrane protein-protein interactions occurring in eukaryotic cells. Lee et al 2009 established that B4GAT1 (now known to be involved in the LARGEdependent O-Mannosylation pathway [demonstrated here and in the companion article from the Campbell laboratory]) interacted with B4GALT1 (an enzyme involved in the generation of multiple types of glycans including, importantly in this context, the synthesis of polyLacNAc), and that they could influence each others location in the secretory pathway. We think it is overly strong to state that these authors arrived at a wrong conclusion as this manuscript\u2019s major conclusion, in our view, was that these two enzymes interact. This appears to be a valid conclusion based on their studies that showed co-immunoprecipitation, co-localization, and the ability of one enzyme to regulate the localization of the other enzyme in the secretory pathway. At the time of these studies, one could postulate that these 2 enzymes associated together to more efficiently produce poly-LacNAc as the 2 activities needed are B3GNT and B4GALT activity. This of course needs to be re-evaluated in light of our findings. Being highly speculative, this complex could be involved in generating the phenomena seen in some cancer types where production of poly-LacNAc goes up and production of the LARGE-dependent glycosylation goes down. However, this remains to be evaluated."
