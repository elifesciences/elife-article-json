TP53 (also called p53) is a protein that normally helps to repair or eliminate these damaged cells and prevent tumors from forming. About half of all cancerous tumors have mutations that prevent TP53 from working. In tumors with normal TP53 (called TP53 wild type tumors), another protein that acts to keep TP53 in check is often overly active. This overactive protein (called MDM2) prevents TP53 from suppressing tumor development. Many scientists are developing anticancer drugs called TP53-MDM2 inhibitors to target the potentially overactive protein in TP53 wild type tumors, and importantly only a tumor with working TP53 would have a chance of responding to this kind of inhibitor."

Using mix of TP53 mutant and TP53 wild type cancer cell lines, the Novartis team identified a set of 13 genes that were highly expressed in cell lines that were sensitive to one of these inhibitors. This 13-gene signature was then suggested as a way to identify which cancer patients with TP53 wild type tumors would be the most likely to benefit from treatment with TP53-MDM2 inhibitors."

That is to say around a quarter of the cell lines thought to have normal TP53 actually had mutations in the gene for TP53. Sonkin then repeated the analysis using only those cell lines that were from TP53 wild type tumors. This revealed that the 13-gene signature cannot predict how cancer cells from a TP53 wild type tumor will respond to a TP53-MDM2 inhibitor. Further work would be beneficial in order to find an accurate test to determine which cancer patients will benefit the most from treatment with TP53-MDM2 inhibitors."

Mechanistically, only tumors with wild-type (WT) TP53 can potentially be sensitive to TP53-MDM2 inhibitors as confirmed in part by sensitivity of WT MEFs\u00a0cells and by the loss of sensitivity in TP53 knockout MEFs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Efeyan et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, clinical trials of TP53-MDM2 inhibitors only include patients with WT TP53 tumors. Based on pre-clinical work, it is clear that not all WT TP53 tumors are sensitive to TP53-MDM2 inhibitors. Multiple attempts have been made to try to predict sensitivity to TP53-MDM2 inhibitors in WT TP53 tumors. Unfortunately, despite these efforts, there is currently no clinically validated and FDA-approved assay to identify WT TP53 tumors most likely to respond to TP53-MDM2 inhibitors."

As a result of this work, <a href=\"#bib6\">Jeay et al., (2015)</a> described the mRNA signature based on 13 TP53 transcriptional target genes. The signature was generated using TP53-MDM2 inhibitor\u00a0sensitive versus insensitive cell lines without regard to the TP53 status. As a critical part of the validation work, <a href=\"#bib6\">Jeay et al., (2015)</a> used an independent set of 52 cancer cell lines that were considered to be TP53 WT. Since the signature was generated without considering TP53 status and the fact that TP53-MDM2 inhibitors can only be effective in WT TP53 tumors, the signature is likely to represent a proxy for TP53 status. Therefore, it would not be expected to enhance the ability to predict sensitivity to TP53-MDM2 inhibitors in TP53 WT tumors, so the reported predictive ability of the <a href=\"#bib6\">Jeay et al., (2015)</a> signature in the set of 52 cancer cell lines considered by authors as TP53 WT is surprising."

Upon reanalysis of the p53 mutational status of the cell lines employed, Sonkin determined that Jeay et al. had not assessed the mutational status of p53 correctly for a number of cell lines. When the analysis is repeated with the annotation by Sonkin, the gene signature no longer predicts drug efficacy, simply discriminating between wild-type and mutant cell lines. In this regard, the report by Sonkin is important, as it challenges some of the main conclusions in the report by Jeay et al. about the utility of the gene signature."
