                    "text": "While the mammalian macrophage phenotypes have been intensively studied in vitro, the dynamic of their phenotypic polarization has never been investigated in live vertebrates. We used the zebrafish as a live model to identify and trail macrophage subtypes. We generated a transgenic line whose macrophages expressing <i>tumour necrosis factor alpha</i> (<i>tnfa</i>), a key feature of classically activated (M1) macrophages, express fluorescent proteins <i>Tg(mpeg1:mCherryF/tnfa:eGFP-F)</i>. Using 4D-confocal microscopy, we showed that both aseptic wounding and <i>Escherichia coli</i> inoculation triggered macrophage recruitment, some of which started to express <i>tnfa</i>. RT-qPCR on Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)-sorted tnfa<sup>+</sup> and tnfa<sup>\u2212</sup> macrophages showed that they, respectively, expressed M1 and alternatively activated (M2) mammalian markers. Fate tracing of <i>tnfa</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> macrophages during the time-course of inflammation demonstrated that pro-inflammatory macrophages converted into M2-like phenotype during the resolution step. Our results reveal the diversity and plasticity of zebrafish macrophage subsets and underline the similarities with mammalian macrophages proposing a new system to study macrophage functional dynamic."

We used the zebrafish as a live model to identify and trail macrophage subtypes. We generated a transgenic line whose macrophages expressing <i>tumour necrosis factor alpha</i> (<i>tnfa</i>), a key feature of classically activated (M1) macrophages, express fluorescent proteins <i>Tg(mpeg1:mCherryF/tnfa:eGFP-F)</i>. Using 4D-confocal microscopy, we showed that both aseptic wounding and <i>Escherichia coli</i> inoculation triggered macrophage recruitment, some of which started to express <i>tnfa</i>. RT-qPCR on Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)-sorted tnfa<sup>+</sup> and tnfa<sup>\u2212</sup> macrophages showed that they, respectively, expressed M1 and alternatively activated (M2) mammalian markers. Fate tracing of <i>tnfa</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> macrophages during the time-course of inflammation demonstrated that pro-inflammatory macrophages converted into M2-like phenotype during the resolution step. Our results reveal the diversity and plasticity of zebrafish macrophage subsets and underline the similarities with mammalian macrophages proposing a new system to study macrophage functional dynamic."

Currently, it is well established that macrophages are not just important immune effector cells but also cells with critical homeostatic roles, exerting a <i>myriad</i> of functions in development, homeostasis, and tissue repair and playing a pivotal role in disease progression (<a href=\"#bib26\">Wynn et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, there is a high interest in a better characterization of these cells to establish an early and accurate diagnosis. The wide variety of macrophage functions might be explained by the outstanding plasticity and versatility of macrophages that efficiently respond to environmental challenges and changes in tissue physiology by modifying their phenotype (<a href=\"#bib13\">Mosser and Edwards, 2008</a>). Although there is a consensus that macrophages are a diversified set of cells, macrophage subtypes are still poorly characterized. Indeed, although these cell populations have been extensively investigated in mouse and human, these studies were mostly performed in vitro using monocyte-derived macrophages induced under specific stimuli. A comprehensive characterization of macrophage subsets that takes into account their specific behaviour, phenotypic diversity, functions, and modulation shall rely on a real-time tracking in the whole organism in response to environmental challenges."

In this classification, M1 macrophages, also referred as classically activated macrophages, are pro-inflammatory cells associated with the first phases of inflammation, while M2 macrophages, also known as alternatively activated macrophages, are involved in the resolution of inflammation and tissue remodelling (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gordon, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Biswas and Mantovani, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Sica and Mantovani, 2012</a>). Differential cytokine and chemokine production and receptor expression define the polarization state of macrophages. However, it is worthwhile to note that such binary naming does not fully reflect the diversity of macrophage phenotypes in complex in vivo environments in which several cytokines and growth factors are released and adjust the final differentiated state (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chazaud, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Thomas and Mattila, 2014</a>). Macrophages might adopt <i>intermediate activation phenotypes</i> classified by the relative levels of macrophage subset-specific markers. Therefore, macrophage plasticity results in a full spectrum of macrophage subsets with a myriad of functions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Mosser and Edwards, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Xue et al., 2014</a>). Although the possible phenotype conversion of macrophages from M1 to M2 has been suggested in in vitro studies, a recent study argues for the sequential homing of M1 and M2 macrophages to the site of injury (<a href=\"#bib22\">Stout et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Sica and Mantovani, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Shechter et al., 2013</a>).

We used the zebrafish larvae model for its easy genetic manipulation, transparency, and availability of fluorescent reporter lines to track macrophages (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ellett et al., 2011</a>).

                                "text": "Fin wounding-induced inflammation and <i>Escherichia coli</i> inoculation in zebrafish larvae of 3 dpf are two well-established models triggering macrophage recruitment. Using in situ hybridization, we observed that the expression of the <i>tumour necrosis factor alpha</i> (<i>tnfa</i>), a consensus marker of M1 macrophages, was induced in cells accumulated in the caudal fin and the muscle following amputation (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 29/33) and <i>E. coli</i> inoculation (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 12/12), respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013E</a>). To study the cells that express the <i>tnfa</i> transcripts, we established the <i>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F)</i> transgenic zebrafish line expressing a farnesylated (membrane-bound) eGFP (eGFP-F) under the control of the <i>tnfa</i> promoter. While eGFP-F was undetectable in intact fins of <i>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F)</i> larvae (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 10/10), it was expressed in cells recruited to the wound at 6 hr post-amputation (hpA) (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 16/16, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>). Similarly, eGFP-F expression was upregulated in cells accumulated in the muscle of <i>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F)</i> larvae at 16 hr post-inoculation (hpi) of DsRed-expressing <i>E. coli</i> (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 8/8), compared to Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injection (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 3/3, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H,I</a>). Confocal analysis confirmed the presence of a membrane-bound eGFP in cells displaying a typical myeloid morphology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). To demonstrate that the <i>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F)</i> line recapitulates transcriptional activation of <i>tnfa</i>, we performed a simultaneous detection of <i>tnfa</i> mRNA by in situ hybridization and GFP-F protein by immunofluorescence in amputated larvae 6 hpA. We observed a consistent overlap between <i>tnfa</i> and GFP-F signal in the fin (n<sub>larvae</sub> = 11/11), showing the direct correlation of eGFP-F and <i>tnfa</i> transcriptional activation in the fin of the reporter line (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). In addition, we FACS-sorted GFP<sup>+</sup> cells from wounded <i>Tg(TNFa:eGFP-F)</i> larvae 6 hpA and performed RT-qPCR to analyze <i>tnfa</i> expression. We observed a significant increase of <i>tnfa</i> mRNA level in eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells as compared to eGFP<sup>\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L,M</a>). All together these results indicate that the <i>Tg(TNFa:eGFP-F)</i> reporter line recapitulates transcriptional activation of <i>tnfa</i>. Then, with the ability to specifically track <i>tnfa</i>-expressing cells, we used <i>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F)</i> fish to study macrophage activation by mating them with <i>Tg(mpeg1:mCherryF)</i> fish in which macrophages express farnesylated mCherry (mCherryF) under the control of the macrophage-specific <i>mpeg1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ellett et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Nguyen-Chi et al., 2014</a>). In intact <i>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F/mpeg1:mCherryF)</i> larvae, no eGFP-F was observed in macrophages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We imaged double transgenic larvae <i>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F/mpeg1:mCherryF)</i> using 4D confocal microscopy from 45 min post-amputation and found that macrophages were recruited to the wound from 1 hpA, some starting to express eGFP from 3 hpA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). From 5 hpA already activated macrophages, that is, expressing <i>tnfa</i> arrived at the wound (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Similarly, infection with a crimson-expressing <i>E. coli</i> in the muscle induced the expression of <i>tnfa</i> in phagocytes few hours following the infection (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Imaging of the double transgenic larvae <i>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F/mpeg1:mCherryF)</i> showed that <i>tnfa</i>-expressing phagocytes were mainly macrophages (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). These results show the dynamic macrophage activation in real-time in vivo including recruitment and rapid phenotypic change. During the revision of this paper, a similar result has been published (<a href=\"#bib28\">Sanderson et al., 2015</a>)."

In mammals, M1 and M2 macrophages are reported to be involved, respectively, in the initial phase of inflammation and in the resolution phase. Cell sorting was thus performed at 6 hpA and 26 hpA following caudal fin amputation since the kinetic analysis of macrophage subset activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) suggested that these two time points correspond to initiation and resolution of inflammation, respectively. As expected, high levels of <i>mpeg1</i> expression was observed in the mCh<sup>+</sup> and dbl<sup>+</sup> sorted cells at 6 and 26 hpA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), and high levels of <i>tnfa</i> expression was detected in double-positive populations at 6 hpA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These observations demonstrated that fluorescence of these transgenes can be efficiently used to track and separate macrophage sub-populations. At 6 hpA, dbl<sup><i>+</i></sup> macrophages expressed high levels of <i>tnfb</i>, <i>il1b</i>, and <i>il6</i> compared to mCh<sup>+</sup> macrophages (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>) that are well-known markers of M1 macrophages in mammals (<a href=\"#bib11\">Mantovani et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Martinez et al., 2006</a>). By contrast, mCh<sup>+</sup> macrophages expressed low levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines at both 6 and 26 hpA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>), but expressed high levels of <i>tgfb1</i>, <i>ccr2</i>, and <i>cxcr4b</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), that are specifically expressed in mammalian M2 macrophages (<a href=\"#bib11\">Mantovani et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Martinez et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Hao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Beider et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Machado et al., 2014</a>). Of note, neither <i>Arginase 1</i> (<i>Arg1</i>), which is largely used as a M2 marker in mouse but not in human (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chinetti-Gbaguidi and Staels, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Pourcet and Pineda-Torra, 2013</a>), nor <i>il10</i> (data not shown), a known M2 marker in mammals (<a href=\"#bib11\">Mantovani et al., 2002</a>), was detected in zebrafish macrophages. Importantly, based on the stability of the eGFP in <i>Tg(tnfa:eGFP-F/mpeg1:mCherryF)</i> larvae allowing us to specifically track the behaviour and fate of pro-inflammatory macrophages, we found that the dbl<sup>+</sup> pro-inflammatory macrophages changed their phenotype at 26 hpA. Indeed, dbl<sup>+</sup> macrophages negative for M2 markers at 6 hpA, displayed at 26 hpA, in parallel to a significant decrease of <i>tnfa, il1b</i>, <i>and il6</i> expression level, a significant increased expression level of <i>ccr2</i> and <i>cxcr4b</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,H</a>). Of note, a tendency toward differential expression level was observed for <i>tnfb</i> and <i>tgfb1</i> between 6 and 26 hpA. To go further and demonstrate that the same macrophages are present at the wound site during inflammation and its resolution, we generated the <i>Tg(mpeg1:GAL4/UAS:Kaede)</i> larvae to track macrophages exploiting the conversion of the native green fluorescence of Kaede into red fluorescence under UV light. Recruited macrophages were photoconverted 6 hpA and imaged at 26 hpA revealing that early recruited macrophages were still present at the wound area 20 hr later (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Then, GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages were specifically tracked using time-lapse imaging of wounded <i>Tg(mpeg1:mCherryF/TNFa:GFP-F)</i> fins from 6 to 26 hpA. We show that initially recruited eGFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages remain at the injury site and still express the GFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). The analysis of macrophage behaviour over time shows that among eGFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages displaying an amyboid phenotype at the wound edge 6 hpA, 50% change toward a fibroblastic phenotype from 11 hpA when they moved distally (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). All together these data show that pro-inflammatory macrophages underwent a phenotypic conversion toward an intermediate phenotype in which both M1 and M2 markers are expressed. In addition, this molecular characterization of macrophages in zebrafish reveals the conservation of macrophage subtypes between zebrafish and human."

Live imaging of transparent transgenic zebrafish larvae allowed the first real-time visualization of macrophage activation and polarization. In parallel, a molecular analysis of macrophage sub-populations highlights the evolutionary conservation of macrophages from fish to mammals. We propose that in response to wounding zebrafish, unpolarized macrophages are recruited to the inflammation site and adopt a M1-like phenotype. Subsequently, they progressively convert their functional phenotype from M1-like to M2-like in response to progressive inflammatory microenvironment changes within the tissue (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Live imaging of the new transgenic line we generated opens new avenues to study in real time in live vertebrates the full spectrum of macrophage activation, polarization, and functions."

The resulting fragment was phosphorylated using T4PNK, digested by NotI and cloned in a farnesylated eGFP (eGFP-F) derivative of pBSKI2 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Thermes et al., 2002</a>). The resulting plasmid (pI2promTNFa:eGFP-F) harbours a 3.8-kb fragment of the zebrafish <i>tnfa</i> promoter, including part of the first coding exon. It uses the endogenous ATG codon of <i>tnfa</i> to drive the translation of eGFP-F. The expressed eGFP-F harbours the first 7 amino acids of zebrafish TNFa at its N-terminus (MKLESRA). The expression cassette is flanked by two I-SceI sites. pI2promTNFa:eGFP-F was co-injected in fertilized eggs with the enzyme I-SceI (New England Biolabs, France). Developing embryos were injected with non-pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> at 3 dpf (days post-fertilization), and those that developed a specific green fluorescence were raised as putative founders. The offspring of putative founders was tested the same way in order to establish the stable transgenic line. Low expression of eGFP in the pharynx at 3 dpf was used to check larvae for the presence of the transgene."

Stained embryos were imaged using a MVX10 Olympus microscope with MVPLAPO 1\u00d7 objective and XC50 camera and using a Zeiss Axioimager with a Zeiss 40\u00d7 Plan-Apo 1.3 oil objective."

At 6 hpA, larvae were mounted in 1% low-melting point agarose. A 405-nm Laser Cube 405-50C on a confocal TCS SP5 inverted microscope with a HCXPL APO 40\u00d7/1.25\u20130.75 oil objective (Leica) was used to photoconvert the Kaede-labelled cells using 6% laser power scanning for 60 s (optimized before the experiments; data not shown). Fins were imaged before and after the photoconversion (at 6 and 26 hpA) in the green and red channels."

As suggested by the reviewers, we generated the <i>Tg(mpeg1:GAL4 /UAS:Kaede)</i> larvae to track Kaede<sup>+</sup> macrophages from 6hpA to 26 hpA. Photoconversion of macrophages recruited at the wound 6hpA demonstrates that most of macrophages stays at the wounded fin 20 hours later. We show that the same macrophages are present at the wound site during inflammation and its resolution suggesting that the same cell might adopt different phenotypes and functions. This result is presented in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>. To directly demonstrate that M1-like GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages recruited at 6 hpA are still present in situ 26 hpA, we have carefully tracked them using time lapse imaging of wounded <i>Tg(mpeg1:mCherryF /TNFa:GFP-F)</i> fins from 6 to 26 hpA, as proposed by the reviewers. Our data demonstrate that initially recruited GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages remain at the injury site and still express the GFP. Moreover, we carefully observed macrophage behavior over time post-amputation. Among GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages displaying an amyboid phenotype at the wound site 6 hpA, 50% change toward a fibroblastic phenotype from 11 hpA when found at distance of the wound area. These data are described in the paragraph \u201cMolecular signature of <i>tnfa</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> and <i>tnfa</i><sup><i>-</i></sup> macrophage populations<i>\u201d</i> and in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A-C</a> and Movie 5. Also, note additional Methods. All together these results show that M1-like GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages expressing high levels of <i>tnfa</i> first accumulate at the wound 6hpA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) and then convert toward a M2-like GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophage phenotype in situ 26hpA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E-H</a>)."

Furthermore, we observed accumulation of mCherry-F in structures inside the macrophage while GFP-F does not. Several factors can explain these differences: 1/ they are not expressed at the same level and 2/ their trafficking toward the membrane may occur differently (mCherry-F may be trapped on its way to the membrane). Membrane targeted mCherry pattern is in sharp contrast with that of the NTR fused with an unmodified form of mCherry. When specifically expressed in macrophages NTR-mCherry is localised in the cytoplasm and is outlined by the GFP-F fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Author response image 1 C and D</a>)."
