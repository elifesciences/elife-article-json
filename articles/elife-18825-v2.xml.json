                    "text": "Beyond their role at nuclear pore complexes, some nucleoporins function in the nucleoplasm. One such nucleoporin, Nup98, binds chromatin and regulates gene expression. To gain insight into how Nup98 contributes to this process, we focused on identifying novel binding partners and understanding the significance of these interactions. Here we report on the identification of the DExH/D-box helicase DHX9 as an intranuclear Nup98 binding partner. Various results, including in vitro assays, show that the FG/GLFG region of Nup98 binds to N- and C-terminal regions of DHX9 in an RNA facilitated manner. Importantly, binding of Nup98 stimulates the ATPase activity of DHX9, and a transcriptional reporter assay suggests Nup98 supports DHX9-stimulated transcription. Consistent with these observations, our analysis revealed that Nup98 and DHX9 bind interdependently to similar gene loci and their transcripts. Based on our results, we propose that Nup98 functions as a co-factor that regulates DHX9 and, potentially, other RNA helicases."

To gain insight into how Nup98 contributes to this process, we focused on identifying novel binding partners and understanding the significance of these interactions. Here we report on the identification of the DExH/D-box helicase DHX9 as an intranuclear Nup98 binding partner. Various results, including in vitro assays, show that the FG/GLFG region of Nup98 binds to N- and C-terminal regions of DHX9 in an RNA facilitated manner. Importantly, binding of Nup98 stimulates the ATPase activity of DHX9, and a transcriptional reporter assay suggests Nup98 supports DHX9-stimulated transcription. Consistent with these observations, our analysis revealed that Nup98 and DHX9 bind interdependently to similar gene loci and their transcripts. Based on our results, we propose that Nup98 functions as a co-factor that regulates DHX9 and, potentially, other RNA helicases."

This membrane system in conjunction with macromolecular gateways, termed nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), regulate transport across the NE. Highly conserved across all eukaryotes, NPCs are composed of\u00a0~30 proteins, termed nucleoporins or Nups, which can be placed into two general categories. One set of Nups lie at or near the membrane and form the cylindrical eight-fold symmetrical NPC scaffold. Among its functions, the core scaffold acts as a binding surface for a second set of Nups (FG-Nups) that line the NPC channel and directly facilitate the movement of nuclear transport factors and their cargoes through the NPC (<a href=\"#bib27\">Field et al., 2014</a>)."

In the absence of Nup98, transcriptional memory was lost and the binding of RNA polymerase II at promoters poised for reactivation was reduced, which matched similar findings in yeast (<a href=\"#bib59\">Light et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib60\">2013</a>). In Drosophila, Pascual-Garcia and colleagues showed binding of Nup98 to the promoter regions of certain active genes and a requirement for Nup98 in their transcription (<a href=\"#bib82\">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2014</a>). Nup98 binding to these genes was dependent on TRX and MBD-R2, a component of the NSL (nonspecific lethal) complex that directs histone H4K16 acetylation. However, the loss of Nup98 did not change H4K16 acetylation or TRX-mediated H3K4 trimethylation patterns, both of which are required for active transcription and transcriptional memory. Thus, the function of Nup98 in the\u00a0transcription of these loci remains unclear."

Of the Nup98 interactors, one of the strongest binding partners was the DExH/D-box protein DHX9 (RNA helicase A). We demonstrate that Nup98 binds DHX9 in the nucleoplasm, regulates the nuclear distribution of DHX9, and influences DHX9 RNA-binding and ATPase activity. Their interactions ultimately influence gene expression at the level of DHX9-mediated transcription and splicing. These data provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which the nucleoporin Nup98 can regulate gene expression away from NPCs."

As an alternative approach to assess the physical relationship between these proteins, we examined the consequences of depleting or overproducing Nup98 on the nuclear distribution of DHX9 and hnRNP U. Depletion of Nup98 resulted in no detectable changes in the distribution pattern of hnRNP U (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). However, the loss of Nup98 caused the appearance of bright DHX9 foci in the nucleoplasm.

In contrast, depletion of DHX9 (or hnRNP U; data not shown) did not noticeably alter Nup98 localization (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To further test this idea, we increased cellular levels of Nup98 and examined the distribution of DHX9 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Elevated levels of Nup98 accumulate in intranuclear foci termed GLFG-bodies (<a href=\"#bib35\">Griffis et al., 2002</a>), and we observed the formation of these foci in cells producing GFP-Nup98 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Importantly, DHX9 was recruited to the GFP-Nup98 foci. By contrast, no visible impact on hnRNP U distribution was observed in GFP-Nup98 producing cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The change in DHX9 distribution was not accompanied by alterations in the cellular levels of DHX9 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), thus the DHX9 associated with GFP-Nup98 foci was likely recruited from other locations."

Immunoprecipitations from these fractions showed that DHX9 was only detected in association with nucleoplasmic Nup98, although similar amounts of Nup98 were purified from both fractions, and that nucleoplasmic DHX9 was able to immunopurify Nup98 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

Binding reactions conducted under these conditions reveal that the interaction of untagged or GST-tagged DHX9 with Nup98 was partially reduced by the addition of RNase A, while the addition of RNA (poly I:C) did not appear to alter the binding of DHX9 to Nup98 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

The interactions of the N- and C-terminal domains of DHX9-GFP with GST-Nup98 appeared to be facilitated by the presence of RNA, as these interactions were sensitive to RNase A. Furthermore, the addition of RNA (poly I:C) prior to mixing of the two proteins stimulated binding of GST-Nup98 and the N-terminal domain of DHX9-GFP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

To test this, the\u00a0ATPase activity of recombinant GST-DHX9 was examined in the presence and absence of GST-Nup98. We observed a basal ATPase rate for recombinant DHX9 that was stimulated by the addition of RNA to levels comparable to that previously reported for DHX9 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib106\">Sch\u00fctz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib140\">Zhang and Grosse, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib141\">1997</a>). In the presence of excess RNA (poly I:C), the addition of GST-Nup98 induced a dose-dependent increase in GST-DHX9 ATPase activity reaching levels approximately five-fold higher than GST-DHX9 and RNA alone at the highest GST-Nup98 concentration tested (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). A similar level of stimulation was also observed using untagged versions of DHX9 and Nup98 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). DHX9 ATPase activity was also increased upon addition of the N-terminal FG/GLFG domain of Nup98.

                                "text": "Given that Nup98 and DHX9 exist in a complex in vivo, and that Nup98 stimulates DHX9 activity in the presence of RNA, we would expect that Nup98 and DHX9 interact with a shared set of mRNAs. To assess this, we compared recently published mRNA binding datasets for Nup98 (<a href=\"#bib33\">G Hendrickson et al., 2016</a>) and DHX9 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Erkizan et al., 2015</a>). We find a statistically significant overlap in these datasets with\u00a0~37% of the Nup98-interacting mRNAs also detected bound to DHX9 and\u00a0~40% of the DHX9 bound transcripts interacting with Nup98 (p=2.5\u00d710<sup>\u221293</sup>; see Materials and methods). To directly test whether these proteins bind similar mRNAs, we immunoprecipitated DHX9 and Nup98 from cell lysates following crosslinking. By using stringent conditions that disrupt the DHX9-Nup98 interaction (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we could assess the ability of each protein to bind RNA independent of one another and determine whether they interact with similar RNA species. RT-PCR was used to test whether specific mRNA species were associated with the immunopurified proteins. We tested for the presence of several potential interacting mRNAs, encoding JunD, Myc, FoxP2, HoxA2, and ZFY (<a href=\"#bib24\">Erkizan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">G Hendrickson et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Hartman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Ranji et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib130\">Weidensdorfer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib137\">Yugami et al., 2007</a>), and two predicted negative controls NHLH2, and HEXIM1. As anticipated, JunD, Myc, FoxP2, HoxA2, and ZFY encoding mRNAs were detected bound to both DHX9 and Nup98 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). By contrast, both NHLH2 and HEXIM1, showed no interaction with either DHX9 or Nup98. Both Nup98 and DHX9 also interacted with the Adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) encoding RNA, a well known splicing reporter whose metabolism is regulated by several hnRNPs and RNA helicases (<a href=\"#bib145\">Zheng, 2010</a>). These results suggest that Nup98 and DHX9 interact with, and potentially regulate, a shared set of mRNAs in vivo."

By contrast, depletion of Nup98 led to a significant increase in the amount of each of the six mRNAs bound to DHX9. The changes in the association of Nup98 or DHX9 with these mRNAs does not appear to be due to a change in the nuclear export status of the tested mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

For this analysis, genes encoding Nup98 or DHX9 fused to <i>E.coli</i> DNA methyltransferase (Dam) were introduced in to HEK293T cells. Modified DNA was then amplified, purified, and used in qPCR reactions to assess whether specific regions of the genome were bound to Nup98 and DHX9. As shown in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, both Nup98 and DHX9 mapped to the six gene loci whose transcripts were bound to Nup98 and DHX9. For <i>JUND</i> and <i>MYC</i>, two regions within these genes were examined: a 5\u2019 region containing the promoter and a region within the 3\u2019 half of the ORF. For both Nup98 and DHX9, robust binding was detected to the 5\u2019 promoter regions of these genes, while binding to regions within their ORFs were lower or absent. Similarly, no detectable binding was observed to the NHLH2 and HEXIM1 genes, consistent with our observation that the transcripts from these genes were not detected in association with Nup98 and DHX9 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Of note, DamID experiments performed with a fusion (Dam-Nup98<sup>1\u2013504</sup>) containing only the N-terminal FG/GLFG domain of Nup98 shown to be sufficient for DHX9 binding (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) displayed a similar chromatin-binding profile (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The binding of Nup98 and DHX9 to the gene loci tested was also interdependent on one another. Depletion of Nup98 or DHX9 significantly reduced the interactions of its binding partner with the target gene (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We therefore suggest that the Nup98-DHX9 complex binds to specific genes and their transcripts."

This assay has been used to evaluate the role of DHX9 in transcription, including defining the contributions of its ATPase activity to its role in transcription (<a href=\"#bib5\">Aratani et al., 2001</a>). Similar to previous reports, expression of exogenous DHX9 in cells containing the CRE-luciferase reporter increased production of luciferase (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). Point mutants in DHX9 that reduce (DHX9<sup>I347A</sup>) or eliminate (DHX9<sup>K417R</sup>) ATPase activity show reduced stimulation of reporter expression (<a href=\"#bib5\">Aratani et al., 2001</a>). Since our in vitro assays showed that Nup98 could stimulate the ATPase activity of DHX9, we tested whether overexpression of Nup98 could stimulate the DHX9-mediated expression of CRE-luciferase. In the absence of exogenous DHX9, expression of Nup98 had no significant effect on the expression of luciferase. However, Nup98 expression stimulated luciferase production in the presence of DHX9 or the ATPase compromised DHX9<sup>I347A</sup> mutant, while having no significant stimulatory impact on luciferase expression in the presence of the ATPase dead mutant (DHX9<sup>K417R</sup>). These results are consistent with our in vitro observations showing Nup98 can stimulate the ATPase activity of DHX9, and they suggest that the stimulatory effect of Nup98 binding to DHX9 supports its role in transcription."

Among the curated DHX9 protein-protein interactions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), factors functioning in mRNA splicing are among the most abundant. In addition, DHX9 has been implicated in splicing regulation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bratt and Ohman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Selvanathan et al., 2015</a>), raising the possibility that the interactions of Nup98 and DHX9 may also play a role in this process. Data sets from RNA-Seq analysis of Nup98 and DHX9 depleted cells reveal a significant overlap in gene products exhibiting altered splicing upon depletion of each protein (see Material and methods). DHX9 depletion altered the splicing of 866 genes, of these 217 genes also show altered splicing upon Nup98 depletion (p=2.03\u00d710<sup>\u221243</sup>). Based on this information, we examined splicing isoforms of the well-characterized E1A mRNA, which interacted with DHX9 and Nup98 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Different E1A splicing intermediates (13S, 12S, 11S, 10S and 9S) have been characterized (<a href=\"#bib112\">Stephens and Harlow, 1987</a>), the abundance of which could be quantified following depletion of Nup98 or DHX9 (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>). Depletion of Nup98 or DHX9 resulted in a 1.9 or 1.8 fold increase in pre-spliced isoform of the transcript (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Furthermore, we observed differential effects on the\u00a0levels of the various splicing isoforms. Depletion of Nup98 led to significantly increased levels of the 12S, 11S and 10S isoforms. A similar increase in 12S and 11S isoform was detected in cells depleted of DHX9. DHX9 depletion also caused significant decreases in 9S and 13S abundance. These results suggest that the interactions of Nup98 and DHX9 with specific mRNAs, such as E1A, regulates their splicing."

However, our understanding of the mechanistic role of Nup98 in this process has lagged due to our limited knowledge of Nup98 binding partners, most notably in the nucleoplasm, and the consequences of these interactions on the functions of the interacting partners. In this work, we focused on a possible mechanism by which Nup98 can alter gene expression through its interaction with, and regulation of, the RNA helicase DHX9. We have shown using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays that Nup98 directly binds DHX9 in the nucleoplasm and this interaction is facilitated by RNA. Importantly, binding of Nup98 to DHX9 can stimulate the ATPase activity of DHX9 and support the role of this DExH/D-box protein in the transcription and splicing of a subset of genes. Consistent with these observations, our analysis revealed that Nup98 and DHX9 bind to similar gene loci and mRNAs, and these interactions are interdependent upon one another. In aggregate, our observations lead us to conclude that intranuclear Nup98 functions as a regulator of DHX9."

Both DHX and DDX helicases contain a highly conserved helicase domain that mediates nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and is linked to binding of nucleic acid (<a href=\"#bib49\">Jarmoskaite and Russell, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib113\">Stevens, 2010</a>). Flanking the helicase domain, DHX family members possess variable N- and C-terminal domains that, while often containing shared sequence motifs, contribute to the diverse functions of family members (<a href=\"#bib47\">Jankowsky and Fairman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</a>). DHX9 contains two double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBD) within the N-terminal third of the protein (<a href=\"#bib141\">Zhang and Grosse, 1997</a>), while the C-terminal third of the protein contains an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide (OB)-binding fold and an RGG-box, a domain that characteristically binds single-stranded nucleic acids.

As mentioned above, these regions also contribute binding surfaces for interacting proteins, and in this study we show that both N- and C-terminal regions of DHX9 bind the N-terminal FG/GLFG repeat region of Nup98 (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). While the nature of these interactions remains to be examined in greater detail, studies of another DHX member, yeast Prp43, and its binding partner Ntr1 offer possible insights into the nature of the interactions between DHX9 and Nup98. Like DHX9, Prp43 contains an OB-binding fold, which binds to an intrinsically unstructured, N-terminal region of Ntr1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Christian et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, the C-terminal region of DHX9 contains an OB-binding fold that binds the unstructured FG/GLFG repeat region of Nup98 (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Intriguingly, the unstructured regions of Ntr1 contain a \u2018G-patch\u2019 motif rich in glycines and bulky, hydrophobic residues (<a href=\"#bib6\">Aravind and Koonin, 1999</a>), a compositional property shared with the FG/GLFG repeats of Nup98. When Ntr1 binds to Prp43, the conformation imparted on the \u2018G-patch\u2019 motif facilitates its binding to RNA (<a href=\"#bib20\">Christian et al., 2014</a>). We speculate that the binding of Nup98 to DHX9 may also impart structural features on the FG/GLFG repeat regions of Nup98 that facilitates binding to RNA. This idea is consistent with our observation that the binding of certain mRNAs to Nup98 is facilitated by DHX9 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>; see below)."

Other factors also function similarly to regulate DHX9. For example, Werner Syndrome helicase interacts with both N- and C-terminal regions of DHX9 to inhibit DHX9 activity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Friedemann et al., 2005</a>). In another case, the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (PRKDC) interacts with DHX9 and increases ATPase activity (<a href=\"#bib68\">Mischo et al., 2005</a>). Mechanistically, the binding of Ntr1 to Prp43 again offers a precedent for how these binding events could regulate DHX9 activity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Christian et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib117\">Tanaka et al., 2007</a>)."

Several observations lead us to conclude that the Nup98-DHX9 complex also resides in the nucleoplasm. First, both depletion and overexpression of Nup98 altered the intranuclear distribution of DHX9, including the recruitment of DHX9 to intranuclear Nup98 foci (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Second, nuclear fractionation revealed that Nup98-DHX9 complexes are present primarily in the nucleoplasm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Finally, DamID analysis established that the association of Nup98 and DHX9 with the same gene loci is interdependent on one another (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Together these results strongly support the existence of an intranuclear Nup98-DHX9 complex. Given that DHX9 appears to be a more abundant protein than Nup98 (<a href=\"#bib70\">Montague et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Schaab et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib128\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib132\">Wilhelm et al., 2014</a>), and that other DHX9 interacting partners appear to bind similar regions of DHX9 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anderson et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Erkizan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Jin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Nakajima et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Pellizzoni et al., 2001b</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Robb and Rana, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Sadler et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Smith et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib118\">Tetsuka et al., 2004</a>), we assume that Nup98 binds and regulates a subpopulation of DHX9.

Only PPIs from curated databases or curated published experiments were included in the PPI retrieval, and a minimum integrated confidence score of 0.5 was required for each interaction (for details see [<a href=\"#bib126\">von Mering et al., 2003</a>]). Identified interactions were visualized using Cytoscape (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003032\">SCR_003032</a>) (<a href=\"#bib111\">Smoot et al., 2011</a>). The PPI network edge thickness (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) represents the integrated confidence score for the interaction (ranging for medium confidence score of 0.5 to high confidence score of 1). Node colour in gray scale from light to dark indicates increasing abundance of the interactor in the GFP-Nup98 immunoprecipitation, based on number of unique peptides present in LC-MS/MS data (ranging from 5 to 30 unique peptides). Clustering of the resulting PPI network with the Cytoscape plugin MCODE (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bader and Hogue, 2003</a>) identified highly interconnected proteins, which are likely to represent protein complexes in PPI network. We used the BinGO Cytoscape plugin (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005736\">SCR_005736</a>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bader and Hogue, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Maere et al., 2005</a>) to perform GO annotation enrichment analysis on the protein clusters identified by the MCODE plugin to infer biological processes for protein complexes. The node clusters identified by MCODE, representing putative protein complexes, along with the biological processes identified as enriched for each complex are indicated on the network as a coloured Venn diagram."

Real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed with the resulting cDNA using SYBR green super mix (Quanta 95055\u2013100), per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, in a Mx3000P QPCR System (Agilent Technologies 401403). All qPCR primers (shown in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>) were designed using Primer3Plus software (<a href=\"#bib122\">Untergasser et al., 2007</a>). Real time PCR results were analyzed as described (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hellemans et al., 2007</a>). Change in the level of each specific mRNA bound to DHX9 or Nup98 is represented as a fold-change, between depleted and mock-depleted cells, in the ratio of bound:total mRNA of each transcript examined (i.e. transcript amount present in IP sample / transcript amount present in input sample). Thus the fold changes in the ratios of bound:total amount of any given transcript account for changes in the levels of that transcript in the depleted cells."

Furthermore, they show that Nup98 stimulates the ATPase activity of DHX9. Using shRNA depletion experiments they then attempt to characterize the functional significance of the NUP98-DHX9 interaction.

The major findings of the manuscript include an identified direct interaction between Nup98 and an RNA helicase DHX9 and specific ways in which Nup98 contributes to known activities of DHX9, such as the ATPase activity, RNA binding and splicing. Importantly, the study also provides evidence for previously suggested but incompletely characterized functions of Nup98 in mRNA binding and RNA splicing. This is particularly interesting since Nup98 and other Nups have been repeatedly shown to contribute to transcription, and the reported roles of Nup98 in RNA processing may be part of this gene regulatory pathway. Although novel and potentially of wide interest, several conclusions in the manuscript require further evidence, controls and clarification, as detailed below."

This is based partly on the fact that DHX9 localizes primarily to the nucleoplasm and the Nup98-GFP and DHX9 co-localize in nucleoplasmic GLFG bodies (subsection \u201cNup98 as a positive regulator of the DBP DHX9\u201d paragraph four, as an example). But the authors do not provide direct evidence that any of these interactions are not occurring at the nuclear pores. The IPs, which led to identification of DHX9 and of other interacting partners of Nup98, are carried out from whole cell lysates, thus it is quite possible that these interactions may represent events that occur at nuclear pores and as part of mRNA export. Furthermore, although Nup98-GFP appears to primarily localize to the intranuclear GLFG bodies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), Nup98 may still also localize to nuclear pores, just at lower levels than into GLFG bodies. It seems critical for the authors' conclusions to provide additional evidence that the Nup98-DHX9 interaction occurs in the nucleoplasmic pool and is not primarily occurring at the NPC. The authors can perhaps fractionate their whole cell lysates and test whether GFP-Nup98 can IP DHX9 (as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) from nuclear soluble fractions or chromatin-enriched fractions."

Can the authors also test that these interactions with RNA occur in the nucleus vs. the cytoplasm, and preferentially in the nuclear soluble fractions? Another approach may be to block nuclear pore transport or mRNA export and test whether these interactions still occur to a similar level."

In vivo interactions between Nup98 and DHX9 (and other interacting partners) are shown only for Nup98-GFP fusion. Although GLFG bodies may be related to some endogenous compartment of the nucleus, it is unclear how they relate to the endogenous functions of Nup98 since normally Nup98 is not seen in such large accumulations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, for instance). The IPs of endogenous proteins, using antibodies to Nup98 and DHX9, do not appear to co-IP each other (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figures 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although the authors provide strong evidence that Nup98 and DHX9 interact directly, it is puzzling that endogenous proteins do not co-IP. Can co-IP between Nup98 and DHX9 be attempted under different conditions? Or can the authors at least comment on this discrepancy?"

Again, there seems to be a possibility that this is a consequence of altered mRNA export and accumulation of these mRNAs at NPC-bound Nup98. Furthermore, the decreased interaction between DHX9 and mRNAs upon depletion of Nup98 in 9B may be a consequence of decreased transcription of these mRNAs due to the function of Nup98 in gene activation. To help distinguish these possibilities, it is essential that the authors show total levels of these transcripts and preferably nascent transcripts in these conditions, in addition to the immunoprecipitated mRNA amounts shown in the figure. Furthermore, it would be helpful to determine if export of these mRNAs is disturbed upon Nup98 or DHX9 depletion, by single RNA FISH or by RT-PCR on nuclear vs. cytoplasmic fractions."

The demonstrated role of Nup98 in alternative splicing is very interesting, but since the authors are focusing on gene expression mechanisms, they need to also assess transcription levels of E1A and whether Nup98 and DHX9 affect generation of the E1A nascent transcript or if their role is restricted to splicing regulation. This would be particularly informative in light of the known roles of Nup98 in binding to transcribing genes, which the authors discuss in the manuscript (subsection \u201cNup98 regulated gene expression via transcription and mRNA processing\u201d). In fact, demonstration of binding of Nup98 or DHX9 to the E1A gene by ChIP-qPCR would also be highly supportive of the conclusions of the paper. Although perhaps not required for this work, it could provide an alternative means to provide further evidence that these interactions are not taking place at the nuclear pores as part of mRNA export."

For the interaction with the intact DHX9, treatment with RNase reduced but did not eliminate the interaction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A-C</a>), leading to the suggestion that the two proteins interact directly. However, it was not established in these experiments that the RNase treatment was complete, leaving open the possibility that a more extensive RNase treatment would have eliminated the interaction altogether by destroying a linker RNA. It is also possible that the interaction is relatively weak. In the in vitro binding experiments the protein concentrations appear to be rather high (based on my calculations using amounts and volumes from the Methods section), well into the micromolar range."

The two proteins bind an overlapping set of RNAs, but this does not indicate a function for the protein-protein complex. In the experiments probing splicing intermediates of E1A, depletion of each protein influences the ratios of splicing intermediates, but the effects are not the same. Thus, the experiment indicates that both proteins influence splicing of E1A, but not that the two proteins interact functionally to achieve these effects. This conclusion is accurately reached in the statement, \"Thus, both Nup98 and DHX9 appear to play a role in the regulation of E1A mRNA splicing.\". The finding that Nup98 increases the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of DHX9 is interesting, but there is no information on how this acceleration is achieved or on the functional implications. It is also interesting that depletion of each protein influences the mRNAs that are bound to the other protein in vivo, but this relationship is not straightforward. Depletion of Nup98 decreases binding of several RNAs to DHX9, consistent with a simple mechanism of cooperative binding by the two proteins, but depletion of DHX9 increases mRNA levels bound to Nup98, contrary to the simplest model. Thus, one is left wondering about the functional implications or significance of these results."

In other words this could be an effect of Nup98 that is completely independent of DHX9. However, there are several other pieces of data suggesting the co-localization of DHX9 and Nup98 within the genome, including in regions where they both function, and the two proteins are also shown independently to interact.

Furthermore, the decreased interaction between DHX9 and mRNAs upon depletion of Nup98 in 9B may be a consequence of decreased transcription of these mRNAs due to the function of Nup98 in gene activation. To help distinguish these possibilities, it is essential that the authors show total levels of these transcripts and preferably nascent transcripts in these conditions, in addition to the immunoprecipitated mRNA amounts shown in the figure. Furthermore, it would be helpful to determine if export of these mRNAs is disturbed upon Nup98 or DHX9 depletion, by single RNA FISH or by RT-PCR on nuclear vs. cytoplasmic fractions.</i>"

As discussed, we do observe changes in the levels of transcripts shown to bind Nup98 and DHX9, and we propose that these changes occur as a consequence of the role of these proteins in transcription. It is important to note that the change in the level of each specific mRNA bound to DHX9 or Nup98 is represented as a fold-change, between depleted and mock-depleted cells, in the ratio of bound:total mRNA of each species examined. Thus the fold changes in the ratios of bound:total amount of any given species account for changes in the levels of their transcript in the depleted cells."

We propose that Nup98 and DHX9 bind directly to RNA. However, we are not suggesting that Nup98 or DHX9 use a similar mechanism to bind DNA, but rather, based on previous reports, that they interact with chromatin through their association with CBP/p300 or other transcriptional regulators (subsection \u201cNup98-DHX9 complex functions to regulate transcription and mRNA processing\u201d). These ideas are part of a more complex working model that is consistent with our various observations. However, we have not discussed the details of this broader model in the manuscript, as portions of it remain speculative. In this model, DHX9 is primarily responsible for locus-specific targeting of the Nup98/DHX9 complex. At these loci, the Nup98/DHX9 complex binds RNA transcripts. By stimulating DHX9 activity, Nup98 stimulates release of DHX9 from transcripts, preventing it from leaving the gene locus with the RNA transcript and, thus, effectively stabilizing the interactions of DHX9 with the chromatin. Our data showing that depletion of Nup98 increases the binding of DHX9 to specific RNAs and decreases DHX9 binding to their genes are consistent with this model. A discussion of aspects of this model, necessary to clarify the confusion experienced by the reviewer, is now included."
