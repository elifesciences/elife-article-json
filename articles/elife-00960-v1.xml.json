Cooperation may take place between similar individuals contributing and sharing identical benefits (homotypic cooperation) or between two populations exchanging distinct benefits such as in some forms of mutualism (heterotypic cooperation). Both homotypic and heterotypic cooperation are vulnerable to cheaters (<a href=\"#bib43\">Turner and Chao, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Strassmann et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bronstein, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Rainey and Rainey, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Travisano and Velicer, 2004</a>). Cheaters exploit cooperative benefits without contributing their fair share and are therefore competitively superior to their cooperating counterparts. How might cooperation avoid being taken over by cheaters? The answer lies in \u2018positive assortment\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fletcher and Doebeli, 2009</a>), in which benefit-supplying individuals interact more with other benefit-supplying individuals than with cheaters."

Positive assortment can also be realized through \u2018kin fidelity\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sachs et al., 2004</a>). For example, restricted migration in a spatial environment causes homotypic cooperators and cheaters to cluster with their respective progeny. This clustering allows cooperators to preferentially interact with each other (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, top). Both mechanisms of positive assortment can favor cooperation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hamilton, 1964a</a>; <a href=\"#bib18a\">Hamilton, 1964b</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Maynard Smith, 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chao and Levin, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nowak and May, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fletcher and Doebeli, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kerr et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">MacLean and Gudelj, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">West et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lion and Baalen, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wild et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">West and Gardner, 2010</a>).

Alternatively, heterotypic cooperation can involve two genetically unrelated populations (e.g., species) exchanging distinct benefits that are costly to produce. For example, legume plants supply organic carbon and other essential nutrients to rhizobia, and rhizobia reciprocate with fixed nitrogen (<a href=\"#bib44\">Udvardi and Poole, 2013</a>). Positive assortment in heterotypic cooperation can be achieved through \u2018partner choice\u2019 and \u2018partner fidelity feedback\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bull and Rice, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sachs et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Foster and Wenseleers, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Weyl et al., 2010</a>). In partner choice, active mechanisms (disruptable through for example mutational or pharmacological means) enable an individual to differentially reward cooperative instead of non-cooperative partners based on a signal. Thus, discrimination mediated by partner choice can occur in advance of exploitation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bull and Rice, 1991</a>). For instance, in the mutualism between client fish and cleaner fish in which cleaner fish obtain food from removing client parasites, client fish recognize and avoid cheating cleaners that also bite healthy tissues (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bshary, 2002</a>). In partner fidelity feedback, fitness-feedback from repeated interactions ensures that aiding the partner helps self. Examples of partner fidelity feedback can be found in mutualism between hosts and their vertically transmitted symbionts, for example, between eukaryotes and their endosymbioic mitochondria and chloroplasts (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sachs et al., 2011</a>)."

Spatial environment, which facilitates repeated interactions between neighboring individuals, has been shown to promote heterotypic cooperation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boucher et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Doebeli and Knowlton, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Yamamura et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">West et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Harcombe, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mitri et al., 2011</a>). However, the mechanism for how partner fidelity feedback unfolds in a spatial environment is not well understood. Specifically, how might spatial correlation in the tendency to contribute arise between genetically unrelated heterotypic cooperators when such correlation was initially absent (<a href=\"#bib16\">Frank, 1994</a>)? If population viscosity was the sole driving force, then clusters of cooperators and clusters of competitively superior cheaters would be expected to have equivalent access to clusters of heterotypic cooperative partners. This would seem to favor cheaters (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, bottom). Instead, we show that in a spatial environment, asymmetric fitness effects of cooperators and cheaters on partners during cell growth into open space drives assortment. This emergence of non-random patterns from initially random spatial distributions, known as self-organization, automatically grants cooperators instead of cheaters more access to heterotypic cooperative partners, disfavoring cheaters. Thus, partner fidelity feedback through self-organization excludes cheaters without evolving recognition mechanisms."

In the absence of initial spatial asymmetry, other stochastic effects such as the initial metabolite-storage state of the cell, cell rearrangement, and death events broke the symmetry and self-organization still emerged (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Even though the final partner association index from random initial distribution was greater than that from periodic distribution, the latter was still significantly greater than 1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Consequently, cooperators still outperformed cheaters in periodic initial distribution, even though the degree of outperformance was greater in random initial distribution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

Since self-organization was only observed during cooperation and cheating but not during competition, the very acts of cooperation and cheating are required. When the fitness effects of interactions are the major driving force of patterning, interacting populations are expected to intermix if both supply spatially localized large fitness benefit to the other (<a href=\"#bib30\">Momeni et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, lack of benefit to either population causes population segregation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Momeni et al., 2013</a>).

Given that cells dividing toward partners will on average have more access to benefits than those dividing away from partners, both cooperators and cheaters pile over partners. Cooperators reciprocate by supplying a large, but different, localized benefit to the partner, while cheaters do not. Thus, partners grow and pile over cooperators but not cheaters. Consequently, further growth of cooperators is facilitated, while cheaters become isolated and disfavored. In this simulation, cheaters have an 8% fitness advantage over cooperators.

Self-organization is driven by the asymmetry between cooperators and cheaters in the amount of spatially localized benefits they supply to the heterotypic partner during cell growth into open space. Our previous work has shown that if two distinct populations receive spatially localized large fitness benefits from each other, then the two populations are expected to intermix (<a href=\"#bib30\">Momeni et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, when the fitness benefit to at least one population is small, then cell types are not expected to intermix (<a href=\"#bib30\">Momeni et al., 2013</a>). Consequently, partners intermix with cooperators but not cheaters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3\u20137</a>). This difference in the tendency to intermix causes differential partner association, which facilitates the growth of cooperators and isolates and disfavors cheaters. Indeed in simulations, if intermixing was prevented through delocalizing benefits (<a href=\"#bib30\">Momeni et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Allen et al., 2013</a>), or if intermixing was imposed on all cells through high initial cell densities, self-organization and cooperator advantage over cheaters diminished (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Similar trends are observed in recent works which mathematically examined diffusion of public good in homotypic cooperation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2a\">Borenstein et al., 2013</a>)."

When cooperative benefits were limiting, the most \u2018helpful\u2019 cooperator ended up with the highest number of partners and was most favored. In our mathematical model, we could be sure that this was not due to partner recognition. Thus, in theory, self-organization through partner fidelity feedback is capable of achieving finer levels of discrimination without requiring sophisticated cognition and memory. Without knowing the molecular mechanisms of interactions, one could easily confuse partner fidelity feedback with partner recognition, because both are capable of discriminating partners of varying cooperative qualities. Our work suggests that any argument on partner recognition in a system that is intrinsically spatial (such as legume and rhizobia and fig and colonizing fig wasp) will require identifying variants that fail to distinguish cooperators from cheaters. Otherwise, interpreting cheater discrimination as \u2018partner choice\u2019 can be misleading."

Furthermore, high levels of non-producers can still destroy byproduct mutualism in a spatial environment (simulation results in <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Agarose in the rectangular petri dishes was subsequently cut into 24 mm \u00d7 24 mm \u00d7 4 mm pads. For competition experiments, 2\u00d7 SD was supplemented with lysine and adenine (650 \u03bcM and 430 \u03bcM final concentrations, respectively). The communities on agarose were inoculated either from a uniform distribution of all cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> at 3000 or 10,000 total cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) or a high-density inoculum of \u223c2 mm diameter (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> at \u223c8 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> total cells/mm<sup>2</sup>), as specified. We grew well-mixed liquid cocultures in 3 ml of 1\u00d7 SD without supplementing adenine or lysine, with initially 5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> total cells/ml.

Based on fluorescence intensities in the DsRed, YFP, and CFP channels, cell types were assigned to each pixel in fluorescent images. Pixels having fluorescence intensities less than 30% above the background in all fluorescence channels were defined as \u2018no signal\u2019. Otherwise, fluorescence intensities in each channel were normalized to their respective image-wide 90th percentile values and pixel identity was assigned to be the same as the fluorescence channel with the highest normalized intensity. For cross-sections taken from the center of communities in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, the top crown of cross-sections appeared very bright, whereas the middle and lower regions appeared dim (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This large dynamic range caused artifacts in cell identification. The intensity thresholds in these sections were therefore manually adjusted to increase the accuracy of cell identification. Eliminating manual adjustments did not alter the conclusions."

Assumptions concerning cell rearrangement were derived from experimental observations (<a href=\"#bib30\">Momeni et al., 2013</a>). Time-lapse images of the growth of a single fluorescent cell into a microcolony showed that the center of the microcolony became brighter due to multiple cell layers when the microcolony grew to larger than a five-cell radius (<a href=\"#bib30\">Momeni et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we assumed that each cell initially budded in the horizontal plane and pushed others in its immediate neighborhood to the side along the shortest path to empty space. Once a cell was completely surrounded on each side by roughly five cells, it either budded directly upward with a probability of 70% or randomly budded to one of the sides at the same level, pushing up the displaced cell and all the cells above. The probability of 0.7 (instead of 1) of dividing directly upward is estimated from experimental observations: when individual green-fluorescent cells were surrounded by many equally fit competing red-fluorescent cells, vertical cross-sections showed that as z increased, the progeny of the green-fluorescent cell \u2018diffused\u2019 laterally (instead of remaining a vertical line) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a> in <a href=\"#bib30\">Momeni et al., 2013</a>). Since we cannot experimentally track all possible outcomes of cell rearrangement, this assumption is a simplification of reality. This simplification could have contributed to the discrepancy between experimental and simulation patterns, although our conclusions from experiments and simulations are similar."

Currently you posit partner choice/recognition as a possible mechanism favouring mutualism and contrast a spatial environment as an alternative explanation. You state however that the \u201cmechanism is unclear\u201d and that there is a \u201cparadox\u201d in terms of the effect of space. In fact this is an example of \u201cpartner fidelity feedback\u201d, a mechanism that is well known in the mutualism literature, so there is no paradox. The essence of partner fidelity feedback is that increasing the fitness of a mutualistic partner itself leads to increased fitness for the other partner. The results can thus be easily explained within this framework: cooperators increase the local fitness of their mutualist partners, thus receiving more cooperation themselves. Empty space is required for cooperators and their partners to grow into in order to self-organise."

Ideally you should be able to show that cheaters should also outcompete cooperators. However, it is acknowledged that this relies on an unstructured environment, so you would need to add a non-spatial treatment. If this is feasible it would be great, but other approaches to solve this issue might also be acceptable."

It seems that modeling efforts would only help to arrive at such statements, but would not be sufficient to \u201censure\u201d this. Even more problematic is the fact that the model description is far from sufficient to repeat the simulations. In the equation, D is treated as a spatially varying function, but then referred to as a constant. With two different constant values, there are two different equations, but the position of D in a later equation suggests an unnecessary complication. The text suggests that this equation is solved numerically, but no details are given except the boundary conditions. Instead, you give many simulation results as figures, but it is completely unclear how randomness emerges in the deterministic equations. Is this based on some stochastic initial condition (although you speak of densities)? Or do you use a stochastic algorithm to numerically solve a deterministic equation? In the supplement, you list many parameters (enough to fit all kinds of things), but there is no information on how exactly these enter. The only equation in the paper seems to be almost decoration."

As the strains have been pre-adapted they are likely to no longer be isogenic. As such, all fitness effects observed thereafter could be owing to differing mutations between cooperators and cheaters that have different effects depending on the environment. While much early research on social behaviour in microbes used similarly non-isogenic lines, this has resulted in reduced impact of this work in molecular microbiology.

First, our assumption on how cells rearrange to accommodate new cells is clearly simplified. We assumed that with a probability of 0.7, a confined cell will send its new daughter cell straight up and with a probability of 0.3, the new daughter displaces a neighbor cell, causing the displaced neighbor cell and all cells above it to \u201cbulge\u201d up. In reality, the new daughter cell could divide diagonally up. So far, we don\u2019t have ways to experimentally track all possible ways of cell rearrangement and thus our assumption is a simplification of experimental reality. We have now discussed this in Materials and methods. Second, genetically identical cells in the same environment may behave very differently. For example, cells in the top crown of a community are always much brighter than cells down below, even though many cells down below retain the ability to divide (i.e., they are live). We don\u2019t know how these physiological differences may impact nutrient consumption and growth."

These, and the fact that in nature, cooperators have to face cheaters some of which are of different species and therefore non-isogenic (such as the non-pollinating wasps of fig), and most importantly, the need to show that perturbation of spatial environment causes cheaters to rise in abundance, originally made us to include the experimental result in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>.

We opted to use \u201ccooperation\u201d rather than \u201cmutualism\u201d to emphasize that the act of helping the partner confers a cost to self. This leads to the social dilemma where cheaters that do not help the partner have fitness advantage over their cooperating counterparts. We believe that using just the term \u201ccooperation\u201d is not adequate, because we want to emphasize that in our system, cooperation involves exchange of distinct benefits between two distinct populations rather than cooperation involving exchanging of identical benefits between identical individuals which the majority of the field has been studying. The term \u201cinterspecific cooperation\u201d implies that cooperators are between different species. Even though our yeast strains can be regarded as different \u201cspecies\u201d because they do not mate with each other, they can also be considered the same species if one uses the divergence in ribosomal RNA sequences to define species (a field standard)! Most importantly, heterotypic cooperation can apply to cooperation between phenotypically differentiated subpopulations, such as between different cell types in a multicellular organism. We have thus chosen to use \u201chomotypic cooperation\u201d and \u201cheterotypic cooperation\u201d to most precisely represent the context of our work.

This is the aspect that we are focusing on as self-organization, and it is supported by both simulations and experiments. The microstructure in simulated results that the reviewer is referring to is likely caused by the cell rearrangement assumption in the model. Each new daughter cell in simulations can divide in a random direction, and each division event independently causes rearrangement of some cells in the community. In contrast, in experimental communities, presumably cells rearrange according to the collective pressure exerted by all growing cells. As such, some artifacts, including finer structure at the individual cell level, is expected in the simulation results, which would explain larger values of association index compared to the experiment. Alternatively, some of the finer spatial features in the experimental cross-sections may have been lost in fixing and cryosectioning processes, leading to smaller association indexes when compared to the simulations. Nevertheless, when compared with the competition control, both simulations and experiments clearly show self-organization, which is the main message of our paper."

In a strict sense, population size matters.
