Some scientists suggest that making this choice after the tumor has been detected may already be too late. Now, in eLife, Andrei Akhmetzhanov and Michael Hochberg at the University of Montpellier II have used a mathematical model to compare cancer prevention (treatment before a diagnosis) with cancer intervention (treatment after a diagnosis). In many cases, they found that prevention is the best option (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akhmetzhanov and Hochberg, 2015</a>)."

Certain mutations, dubbed \u2018driver mutations\u2019, alter the behavior of the cells, allowing them to divide faster or die slower; this results in faster overall growth (<a href=\"#bib3\">Haber and Settleman, 2007</a>). This ability to grow more quickly, which depends on the genetic make-up of the cells as well as their environment, defines the cells' \u2018fitness\u2019. Thus, cells that are fitter than others can overcome the tightly regulated processes that keep the number of cells in an organ constant. These cells may then start to form a (pre)-malignant colony that can become highly diverse. As well as the driver mutations that increase cell growth, colony cells can also develop \u2018passenger mutations\u2019, which may be regarded as random modifications that may not cause a noticeable difference in the cells' behavior."

When a drug is applied, the environment inside the tumor changes, and all the cells that are sensitive to the treatment either slow down their growth or start decaying. However, it is possible that some of the passenger mutations that have been accumulating in the colony confer resistance to the drug. Cells with these mutations now experience a growth advantage because they are \u2018fitter\u2019 than the rest of the cells. This drug resistance is a serious problem in the treatment of cancer and has been studied extensively (<a href=\"#bib4\">Holohan et al., 2013</a>). In particular, researchers have proposed mathematical models that aim to find a treatment strategy that minimizes the risk of drug resistance emerging (<a href=\"#bib2\">Goldie and Coldman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Komarova and Wodarz, 2014</a>)."

Using a model based on evolutionary dynamics, they compared the typical intervention strategies that are carried out post-diagnosis with a less common but promising strategy of tumor prevention. The logic behind this model is as follows. Imagine that a cancerous colony grows from one cell and randomly accumulates various mutations. In the post-diagnostic intervention strategy, the colony must have grown to a considerable size, such that it can be detected (a minimum of a billion cells). At this point, surgery is used to cut the colony down to a much smaller size, and then a certain anti-cancer treatment\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, a chemotherapy drug\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is applied. This treatment kills off the cells that are susceptible to it, but any resistant cells that have been generated in the colony will remain."

This is especially feasible for people that have a high likelihood of developing cancer at some point of their life; for example, because they have a inherited mutation that increases their cancer risk. In this second scenario, it is assumed that treatment hits the growing tumor before it has grown to a detectable size. For the sake of comparison, Akhmetzhanov and Hochberg assumed that preventative treatment starts when the colony is the same size as the colony that remains after surgery during post-diagnostic treatment. They also assumed that preventative treatment works in the same way as post-diagnostic treatments by removing susceptible, non-resistant cells. If the preventative treatment fails\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that is, the colony still grows to a detectable size\u00a0\u2013\u00a0surgery is carried out, followed by a second wave of treatment. The question is, which of the two treatment approaches leads to a higher probability of success? (In this model, success is defined as the tumor colony staying below a detectable size for at least 50 years.)"

Unexpectedly, the model also showed that preventative strategies can be highly effective, even at very low treatment doses."

For example, it will be important to examine the effects of cell competition and limited resources, as opposed to the unbounded growth considered so far. Furthermore, including different types of treatments\u00a0\u2013\u00a0as well as combination treatments\u00a0\u2013\u00a0will be important to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the relative benefits of the different treatment approaches. This is needed to account for the fact that long-term cancer prevention strategies may not use the same intensive chemotherapies that are currently used after cancer has been diagnosed. Finally, the toxicity effects experienced by patients on prevention therapies have to be studied and quantified in more detail."
