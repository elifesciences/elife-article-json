Here, we have extended this work by determining how the individual columns of the PAG interact with higher cortical centres, both at rest and in the context of breathlessness threat. Activation was observed in ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) and lateral PAG (lPAG), where activity scaled with breathlessness intensity ratings, revealing a potential interface between sensation and cognition during breathlessness. At rest the lPAG was functionally correlated with cortical sensorimotor areas, conducive to facilitating fight/flight responses, and demonstrated increased synchronicity with the amygdala during breathlessness. The vlPAG showed fronto-limbic correlations at rest, whereas during breathlessness anticipation, <i>reduced</i> functional synchronicity was seen to both lPAG and motor structures, conducive to freezing behaviours. These results move us towards understanding how the PAG might be intricately involved in human responses to threat."

Here, we have extended this work by determining how the individual columns of the PAG interact with higher cortical centres, both at rest and in the context of breathlessness threat. Activation was observed in ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) and lateral PAG (lPAG), where activity scaled with breathlessness intensity ratings, revealing a potential interface between sensation and cognition during breathlessness. At rest the lPAG was functionally correlated with cortical sensorimotor areas, conducive to facilitating fight/flight responses, and demonstrated increased synchronicity with the amygdala during breathlessness. The vlPAG showed fronto-limbic correlations at rest, whereas during breathlessness anticipation, <i>reduced</i> functional synchronicity was seen to both lPAG and motor structures, conducive to freezing behaviours. These results move us towards understanding how the PAG might be intricately involved in human responses to threat."

Subjective perceptions of breathlessness are not simply a neurological reflection of lung function (<a href=\"#bib5\">Banzett et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Teeter and Bleecker, 1998</a>), and can cause crippling anxiety when perceived as a direct threat to survival. These perceptions rely on an intricate system of sensory and affective components within the brain (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hayen et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Herigstad et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lansing et al., 2009</a>), both perceiving ventilatory afferents and evaluating the threat value of these sensations. Furthermore, repeated episodes of breathlessness can lead to conditioned associations between a stimulus (such as a flight of stairs) and breathlessness (<a href=\"#bib18\">De Peuter et al., 2004</a>), inducing anticipatory threat behaviours such as freezing or activity avoidance (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hayen et al., 2013b</a>)."

The PAG is divided into four longitudinal columns (ventrolateral, vlPAG; lateral, lPAG; dorsolateral, dlPAG; dorsomedial, dmPAG) on each side, and is postulated to act as an interface for behavioural control (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bandler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bandler and Shipley, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Benarroch, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Keay and Bandler, 2001</a>). The PAG has previously been implicated in many basic survival functions including cardiovascular, motor and pain responses such as vocalization or blood pressure regulation (<a href=\"#bib17\">De Oca et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Mobbs et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Paterson, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Pereira et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Tracey et al., 2002</a>). An integrative theory of these behaviours postulates that the lPAG and dlPAG are thought to orchestrate \u2018active\u2019 responses (such as fight or flight responses) when a threat is perceived as escapable (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bandler and Carrive, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carrive, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Depaulis et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Keay and Bandler, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Yardley and Hilton, 1986</a>). Conversely, the vlPAG is thought to be involved with \u2018freezing\u2019 type behaviours from inescapable threats (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carrive and Bandler, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Keay et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Lovick, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Tovote et al., 2016</a>), including conditioned anticipation of breathlessness in humans (<a href=\"#bib25\">Faull et al., 2016b</a>). In recent work to understand this circuitry in animals, Tovote and collegues (<a href=\"#bib87\">Tovote et al., 2016</a>) intricately mapped direct neuronal connections from the central nucleus of the amygdala to the vlPAG, and onwards to premotor areas in the ponto-medullary reticular formation to underlie freezing behaviours. However, the extent to which this descending circuitry and the additional (unmapped) ascending circuitry between the PAG columns and cortex exist in humans is not yet understood."

This work revealed that activity can be localised to the lPAG during breath holds (<a href=\"#bib24\">Faull et al., 2015</a>), to the vlPAG during conditioned anticipation of breathlessness, and to the lPAG during breathlessness itself (<a href=\"#bib25\">Faull et al., 2016b</a>). In this study we further tested the hypothesis that the vlPAG is involved with learned anticipatory threat detection, whilst the lPAG is associated with the active response to breathlessness, by investigating how these PAG regions interact with the wider cortex. We firstly conducted an ultra-high field 7 Tesla whole-brain fMRI experiment to asses functional activity during both anticipation (a future-oriented emotional state typically associated with worry, apprehension and freezing behaviours) and a breathlessness stimulus. We then extended this analysis beyond simple co-activation, to measure the \u2018functional connectivity\u2019 between the task-activated seed regions of the PAG and remote areas of the cortex, both at rest and during the anticipation and breathlessness tasks."

Therefore, the term \u2018functional connectivity\u2019 in this paper was defined as the co-activation of the timeseries between the PAG columns and the cortex. Measures of this connectivity both at rest and during a specific task can be used to investigate the task-specific changes in functional connectivity between regions, but do not infer directionality or causality. Importantly, human investigation allows us to directly assess how functional activity and connectivity are related to subjective emotions such as the anxiety associated with threatening stimuli, while animal models rely on inferences of these perceptions from physiology such as changes in respiratory rate and heart rate. The findings of this study will help us to understand the how the different PAG columns interact with the wider cortex in humans, both at rest and when perceiving a threatening stimulus such as breathlessness."

The following day this breathing paradigm was repeated during task fMRI scanning, with an additional resting state fMRI scan and structural scanning. Task fMRI data was analysed for mean changes in BOLD activity, and functional activity identified in both the vlPAG and lPAG was then subsequently analysed for functional connectivity with the wider cortex both\u00a0at rest (using the resting state scan), and during anticipation and breathlessness (using the task fMRI scan)."

The \u2018resistance\u2019 onset and duration were calculated from the recorded inspiratory pressure physiological traces, while the anticipation duration (\u2018anticipation\u2019) was calculated from the onset of the stimulus to the beginning of the resistance. The \u2018P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>\u2019 trace was included to de-correlate the CO<sub>2</sub>-induced BOLD changes from the respiratory stimuli throughout the functional scan, and was formed by linearly interpolating between the end-tidal expired CO<sub>2</sub> peaks. \u2018No anticipation\u2019 and \u2018finger opposition\u2019 onset and duration represented the presentation of the corresponding stimuli on the screen, and \u2018relief from resistance\u2019 was modelled as the rest periods immediately following each resistance application, prior to ratings (4 s duration). The \u2018no resistance\u2019 regressor was a single trial where no resistance was applied following an anticipation period, allowing greater decorrelation between the anticipation and resistance regressors. The \u2018act of rating\u2019 regressor was included to remove noise from the physical act of pressing the button box, and spanned each of the rating periods. Finally, \u2018demeaned ratings\u2019 matched the \u2018resistance\u2019 regressor for timings, and the intensity of the regressor was the demeaned intensity value assigned to each of the inspiratory resistance blocks, to remove the trial-by-trial variability of subjective perceptions of resistive loading from the mean \u2018resistance\u2019 regressor. Contrasts of interest were the first regressor of the \u2018resistance\u2019 FLOBS set for the breathlessness task, and a differential contrast between the first of each of \u2018anticipation\u2019 and \u2018no anticipation\u2019 for the anticipation task.

Our resting connectivity analysis revealed communications between the lPAG and sensorimotor structures such as primary motor and sensory cortices, caudate and putamen, consistent with known white matter connectivity profiles determined in humans using diffusion tractography (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ezra et al., 2015</a>). This profile demonstrates plausible pathways for involvement in active responses through functional sensorimotor connections to the primary motor and sensory cortices and caudate nucleus (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cools, 1980</a>). The lPAG showed no changes in connectivity profile during anticipation, while during breathlessness exhibited increased connectivity to the amygdala correlating with subjective anxiety scores. These results reveal a potential anxiety-encoding pathway through the amygdala during the perception of the breathlessness stimulus (<a href=\"#bib16\">Davis, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Stein et al., 2007</a>). This pathway may incorporate into both existing neurocognitive anxiety models of prefrontal-amygdala top-down contributions to threat responses (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bishop, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2007</a>), and amygdala - bed nucleus of the stria terminalis triangulation with the PAG previously shown in animals (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gray and Magnuson, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Hopkins and Holstege, 1978</a>). Therefore, in this study we have demonstrated not only lPAG activity during breathlessness, but functional connectivity of the lPAG that may potentiate active responses to an escapable stressor and the anxiety encoding of this threat. We do not yet know whether these findings are specific to respiratory threat or generalizable. Therefore, future work investigating functional connectivity of the substructures of the PAG could employ alternative threatening stimuli, for example pain, to extend our understanding of the role of the PAG columns across generalized threat responses."

However, this resting connectivity profile of the vlPAG displays no functional connections to primary motor structures through which it might orchestrate a \u2018freeze\u2019 response to an inescapable threat. Therefore, to instigate freezing during anticipation of breathlessness, our exploratory analyses have shown that the vlPAG appears to <i>disconnect</i> with both the lPAG and primary motor, sensory and cerebellar structures in those subjects who perceived greater breathlessness intensity, and increased connectivity to the insula with greater anxiety. Lastly, during breathlessness the vlPAG also demonstrated reduced connectivity to motor structures (limited to the putamen and cerebellum) and increased to the anxiety-processing inferior middle insula (<a href=\"#bib54\">Liotti et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Simmons et al., 2006</a>), suggesting that this stimulus may also be eliciting an element of perceived inescapable threat, with subjects secured and immobile on a breathing system in the scanner."

All PAG columns have been shown to project to all other columns in animals (<a href=\"#bib44\">Jansen et al., 1998</a>), and vlPAG and lPAG outputs have also demonstrated reciprocal inhibition to each other and downstream targets (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carrive, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Jansen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Lovick, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Tovote et al., 2016</a>). While the translation to humans is not yet known, a similar system would allow intra-PAG communications (such as those demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> during anticipation and breathlessness) that may permit switching or selecting between threat behaviours. Therefore, the apparent reduced connectivity to motor structures during \u2018freeze\u2019 may be via inhibition of the lPAG and its downstream connections, inhibiting the \u2018fight/flight\u2019 to instigate freezing."

Firstly, animal models have shown direct stimulation of the lPAG to result in tachypnea in the rat (<a href=\"#bib84\">Subramanian and Holstege, 2013</a>) and cat (<a href=\"#bib83\">Subramanian and Holstege, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Zhang et al., 1994</a>), and have even postulated the presence of a suffocation alarm within PAG columns including the lPAG (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lopes et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Schimitel et al., 2012</a>). Here we see lPAG activity in response to a respiratory threat that parallels subjective intensity, where active increases in breathing effort are required to overcome the inspiratory resistance. This synergy between animal and human models allows us to develop our understanding of the potential role of the lPAG in overcoming perceived <i>respiratory</i> threats such as airway obstruction and breathlessness, as well as a possible more generalised tachypneic response to wider threat perceptions."

Rather than measure breathing changes to a conditioned threat, animal models have instead employed direct PAG stimulation and subsequently measured the breathing responses, reporting changes such as irregular breathing (<a href=\"#bib82\">Subramanian et al., 2008</a>), expiratory prolongation (<a href=\"#bib85\">Subramanian, 2013</a>), and apneas (<a href=\"#bib84\">Subramanian and Holstege, 2013</a>). Furthermore, no animal studies to date have employed a conditioned <i>respiratory</i> threat to evoke defensive behaviour, and in the current study in humans we find a small increase in ventilation during anticipation of respiratory threat (Supplemental Table 1), alongside vlPAG and lPAG activity. It is possible that the respiratory response to an upcoming conditioned threat is multi-faceted, and while vlPAG activity may inhibit respiratory control centres (<a href=\"#bib84\">Subramanian and Holstege, 2013</a>), the counterpart activity observed in the lPAG may override this and result in stimulation of respiratory control centres (<a href=\"#bib84\">Subramanian and Holstege, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Zhang et al., 1994</a>). Therefore, it is clear that further investigation is needed to understand the intricate control of respiration by the PAG in the face of a both conditioned respiratory threat such as breathlessness, and towards other conditioned threats."

Conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and panic disorder are often characterised by misperceptions of respiratory sensations and inappropriate behavioural responses (<a href=\"#bib46\">Janssens et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Magadle et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Wisnivesky et al., 2010</a>). We can now begin to provide a platform for investigating related adaptations of the PAG and its functional connections to remote brain regions in these diseases, in addition to previously identified areas such as the medial prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib40\">Herigstad et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Pattinson, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Pattinson and Johnson, 2014</a>). It is possible that heightened activity and \u2018sensitisation\u2019 of the lPAG may result in greater fearful encoding of breathlessness, resulting in an exacerbated anticipatory threat response (potentiated by the vlPAG) to breathlessness stimuli, such as the avoidance of daily activities. It appears that the communication between the columns of the PAG and the wider cortex may be focal in orchestrating human behavioural responses to perceived threat, marking a key step towards understanding and intervening in those with misplaced threat responses, such as the heightened anxiety often observed with COPD (<a href=\"#bib45\">Janssens et al., 2011</a>), asthma (<a href=\"#bib5\">Banzett et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Janssens et al., 2009</a>), panic disorder (<a href=\"#bib80\">Smoller et al., 1996</a>) or pain (<a href=\"#bib95\">Zambreanu et al., 2005</a>)."

Whilst the use of ultra-high field scanners affords us higher-resolutions that facilitate exploration of the subdivisions of the human PAG, there are some constraints within fMRI scanning and analysis that need to be addressed. First and foremost, all fMRI scanning involves imposing a constrained behavioural or cognitive task and measuring the associated brain signal, rather than direct stimulation of an area of interest and measurement of resulting physiology or behaviour (as often employed in animal models). Therefore, when using fMRI, an area of interest (such as an individual column of the PAG) cannot be viewed in isolation, nor its activity identified as causal to the outcome of the task. Additionally, the physical constraints imposed by an MRI scanner, both physical (cylindrical) constraints and the possible effect of large movements on the magnetic field that may corrupt signal, somewhat limit the tasks and the repertoire of available behaviours from the subject, who must remain somewhat motionless during experimental sessions."

The dorsal PAG has previously been implicated in sensory processing and active defence reactions, and is thought to be a major centre in the response to an escapable threat (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bandler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bandler and Carrive, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Canteras and Goto, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dampney et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Keay and Bandler, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Lopes et al., 2014</a>). It is possible that the specific breathlessness paradigm we employed, and the enforced movement constraints of the MRI scanner may have influenced these results and limited dorsal PAG activity. This experimental situation differs vastly from many studies in freely moving animals with implanted electrodes or lesions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bandler and Carrive, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Canteras and Goto, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carrive, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Carrive and Bandler, 1991</a>), or direct-stimulation studies of PAG columns in decerebrate animals (<a href=\"#bib82\">Subramanian et al., 2008</a>). Whilst there have been reports of dorsal PAG activity in humans using functional MRI and threatening word presentations (<a href=\"#bib75\">Satpute et al., 2013</a>), the functional subdivision of the PAG did not follow the consensus of PAG subdivisions from animal literature, and incorporated the separate, well-differentiated nuclei on the ventral border of the PAG within its mask. In the present study we have attempted to functionally localise human PAG activity based on the extensive animal models, and recent evidence in humans (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ezra et al., 2015</a>)."

Therefore, it is possible that intra-PAG functional connections are important within the sensory processing of breathlessness sensations. Alternatively, these findings may represent interspecies differences in PAG activity and/or connectivity when responding to the threat of breathlessness. Therefore, whilst we were unable to identify dorsal PAG activity within our specific experimental task, further work is required to more fully elucidate the roles of the different PAG subdivisions across a range of threatening stimuli in humans."

The functional connectivity methods employed in this study (using correlation strength between seed areas of interest and the wider brain) measure time-locked associations between brain regions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gerstein and Perkel, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">van den Heuvel et al., 2010</a>), but importantly do not measure causality. Therefore, we are currently unsure of the driving, causal centres within these functionally-associated areas, and may be insensitive to functional associations that are too temporally asynchronous or dynamic for our statistical thresholds to identify. The temporal blurring of BOLD signal due to the HRF, coupled with the long (3 s) volume repetition time (TR) employed in this study would mean vastly greater statistical power would be likely necessary to attempt either intricate causality modelling (\u2018effective connectivity\u2019) using methods such as dynamic causal modelling (DCM) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Friston et al., 2003</a>), or more dynamic versions of functional connectivity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chang and Glover, 2010</a>). Whilst techniques such as simultaneous multi-slice imaging are now becoming more mainstream (<a href=\"#bib26\">Feinberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Moeller et al., 2010</a>), researchers may need to be wary of potential blurring between slices deep in the brain within image reconstruction of these acquisitions (<a href=\"#bib26\">Feinberg et al., 2010</a>), which may temper our ability to functionally isolate structures such as the subdivisions of the PAG."

Therefore, brain signal that is directly linked with these periodic fluctuations cannot be disentangled from physiological noise, and will be regressed out when using rigorous noise correction procedures. In the present study we were not attempting to directly link PAG activity to changes in respiratory rhythm generating centres, instead the primary aim was to link PAG activity with the perception of a respiratory threat. Future research looking to identify PAG-related changes in human respiratory rhythm generation will need to carefully consider possible experimental approaches to achieve this."

We have found that the lPAG is active during both anticipation of breathlessness and during the sensation of breathlessness. The lPAG is functionally connected to sensorimotor cortical structures at rest for possible active fight/flight behavioural pathways, and during breathlessness it exhibits increased connectivity to the amygdala in that correlates with subjective anxiety scores. Conversely, the vlPAG is active only during anticipation of breathlessness, is functionally connected to fronto-limbic evaluative structures at rest, and during anticipation <i>disconnects</i> from the lPAG and sensorimotor structures to possibly potentiate a \u2018freezing\u2019 response to an inescapable threat. This work extends our previous findings of differential vlPAG and lPAG activity during breathlessness, and is a first step in understanding how these PAG columns may interact both with each other and the wider cortex in the generation of behavioural responses to threat in humans."

The following preprocessing methods were used prior to statistical analysis: motion correction and motion parameter recording (using MCFLIRT: Motion Correction using FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib47\">Jenkinson et al., 2002</a>]), removal of the non-brain structures (skull and surrounding tissue) (using BET: Brain Extraction Tool [<a href=\"#bib79\">Smith, 2002</a>]), spatial smoothing using a full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel of 2 mm, and high-pass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting; 120 s). Spatial smoothing was limited to 2 mm, to maintain the improved functional resolution (2\u00a0x\u00a02 \u00d7 2 mm) afforded by 7 Tesla imaging. Minimal spatial smoothing, whilst conservative, reduces blurring between small structures, such as the columns of the PAG. Distortion correction of EPI scans was conducted using a combination of FUGUE (FMRIB's Utility for Geometrically Unwarping EPIs\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib42\">Holland et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Jenkinson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Jezzard, 2012</a>]) and BBR (Boundary Based Registration; part of the FMRI Expert Analysis Tool, FEAT, version 6.0 [<a href=\"#bib32\">Greve and Fischl, 2009</a>]). Distortion correction is particularly important in areas of the brain that suffer considerable distortions due nearby bony interfaces and proximity to sinuses, such as occurs in the brainstem.

These three regressors allow for more flexibility in the timing and shape of the haemodynamic response function (HRF), which may be caused by slice-timing delays, differences in the HRF between the brainstem and cortex, or differences between individuals (<a href=\"#bib20\">Devonshire et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Handwerker et al., 2004</a>). This HRF flexibility is especially important when modelling both small regions (such as the PAG) and large areas of cortex in a single model, where the HRF likely differs across these regions. Time-series statistical analysis was performed using FILM (FMRIB\u2019s Improved Linear Model), with local autocorrelation correction (<a href=\"#bib93\">Woolrich et al., 2001</a>). The second and third waveforms were orthogonalised to the first to model the \u2018canonical\u2019 HRF, of which the parameter estimate was then passed up to the group analysis in a mixed-effects analysis using FLAME 1\u00a0+\u00a02 (FMRIB\u2019s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects [<a href=\"#bib92\">Woolrich et al., 2004</a>]).

Recent scrutiny of fMRI statistical methods has raised concerns over cluster-based thresholding when combined with parametric testing (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eklund et al., 2016</a>). However, FILM-based autocorrelation correction in FSL minimizes inflations in the rate of false positive results, and minimal spatial smoothing (2 mm) employed in this study lessens the broadening of the data distribution tails (\u2018heavy tails\u2019) that occur when smoothing to a more standard 6 mm, further minimizing changes in false positives (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eklund et al., 2016</a>). When investigating activity within the PAG as an a-prior area of interest, a small-volume mask of the whole PAG was used and permutation testing was employed with threshold-free cluster enhancement (<a href=\"#bib78\">Smith and Nichols, 2009</a>) and a (FWE-corrected) cluster significance threshold of p&lt;0.05. Permutation testing has been shown to robustly control for appropriate false positive rates with both voxelwise and cluster thresholding (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eklund et al., 2016</a>). The main contrasts of interest in this analysis were the BOLD activity that was greater during breathlessness than baseline, and the BOLD activity elicited during anticipation of breathlessness, i.e. anticipation of breathlessness &gt; unloaded breathing."

Thus, it is not clear that the postulated circuits are specific to respiratory control. Consequently, the authors need to soften the specificity of their claim, or perform additional experiments using other threat stimuli to delineate specificity to respiration. This is particularly relevant since the human data presented here are not entirely consistent with studies performed in other species using different, and potentially more precise approaches as will be also raised in a later comment (<a href=\"#bib10\">10</a>)."

PPI is a method aimed at uncovering causal connections, not just co-activation patterns, between brain regions, using linear regression analysis. A primary alternative method is dynamic causal modeling (DCM) a neuronal mass model founded in nonlinear dynamic methods. Many researchers follow Friston in considering DCM a superior method than either PPI or Grainger Causality since it addresses concerns such as directionality, the treatment of inputs as stochastic and the influence of the BOLD hemodynamic response transformation. Although the authors do not directly claim that they have identified roles for the vlPAG and lPAG in causally driving a neuronal system associated with respiratory control, they speak of \"connections\". In the Discussion section the authors mention the possibility of the vlPAG in an \"orchestra(l)\" role and the title clearly implies causality in proposing the PAG as \"puppeteer\". They clearly need to soften their claims. Indeed, it is not entirely clear why the authors chose to use PPI \u2013 a causal method \u2013 and did not just explore what has been called \"functional connectivity\" or the statistical dependencies between regions that may or may not be causal. If the authors had an interest in examining causality but did not find it, they should report this and as well, explain their choice of PPI over DCM. If they were instead primarily interested in exploring functional connections, they should perhaps consider a simpler and less controversial method. If they believe their results do, in fact, demonstrate causality, then they should clearly present this and again make the case for PPI over DCM."

However, the reviewers were unable to find in the Methods section that motion correction information for subjects was modeled as a regressor in any level of the statistical analysis. It would also be important to know as to what residual motion remained after correction and how this was incorporated in the statistics. Some helpful methods for this (see for example Powers et al.) have been suggested. The reviewers suggest performing the analysis after incorporating specific motion correction parameters as regressors as well as analyzing the data for residual motion."

Also, in the Abstract, the authors state that the lPAG was functionally connected with sensorimotor areas (presumably the cortex). What do the authors specifically mean with connected? It is unlikely that the authors want to imply that the PAG has any direct afferent of efferent connections with the sensorimotor cortical areas. One has to assume that another region in the brain might influence these areas, which does not mean that the PAG is connected with the sensorimotor cortical areas.

The dorsal PAG has been suggested to play a strong role in subsequent sensory processing during and following a somatic/autonomic outflow. The dorsal PAG has also been implicated in pain processing, afferent visceral representation and defense reactions. Phantom limb pain human patients often experience dyspnea. Recent animal studies have shown subpopulation of neurons in the dorsal PAG responding freezing and avoidance.

Topographic chemical or optical stimulation have led to detailed insights in columnar specificity that is not entirely consistent with this human study. Both Bandler, & Carrive labs (Carrive, 1993, an important citation missing)/Subramanian and Holstege labs have shown the lateral PAG to be involved in tachypnea. In the cat this leads to flight and as per Bandler/Carrive lab findings, also fight. While in the rat, the lPAG induced tachypnea may well correspond to dyspnea or fright. Freezing however is more caudal and ventrolateral (Subramanian & Holstege 2013a/b, 2014) characterised by distinct apnea/ breath-hold. One could assume that the increase in anxiety levels could affect fright towards freezing per se, thus a breath-hold or apnea, which would then increase the activity in the vlPAG rather than lPAG. However, the results reported by the authors are contrary. Could the authors comment on this? In particular, in light of the experimental approach that provides only limited insights into the causal relationship to respiration as raised in one of the first comments."

Given the non-specificity of the fMRI method vs. highly specific animal methods, I would consider it more important to discuss the findings in humans against animal observations (with appropriate citations, as key references are missing) for inference on PAG function regarding respiratory threat in humans. We suggest that the authors add a separate paragraph to examine human findings against animal studies that have examined the physiology and behavioural responses to respiratory threat."

Particularly when the authors infer upon the inhibition of lPAG and its downstream connections inhibiting the flight/fight to instigate freezing which are clearly elucidated in animal models."

The main sources of physiological noise in fMRI relate to the respiratory and cardiac cycle (Brooks et al., 2013; Glover et al., 2000; Harvey et al., 2008). Whilst cleaning imaging data of unwanted noise, the main caveat for noise correction in general is that any neural signals that are aliased to the cardiac and respiratory cycles will be lost. RETROICOR uses continuous measures of cardiac and respiratory cycles during a scan to regresses out these known quantities. However, it requires hardware investment and technical expertise at the time of scanning. ICA decomposition requires training data that has to be classified manually, which is time consuming and can be subject to experimenter bias. The benefit of using a combination of RETROICOR and ICA decomposition is a comprehensive noise correction, but this has the caveat of requiring an even more complex analysis to ensure that noise is not reintroduced."

The haemodynamic response function (HRF) varies between brain regions and individuals (Handwerker et al., 2004), and the differences in HRF between small structures such as the PAG and large areas of cortex are not yet known. Therefore, instead of using the fixed standard gamma waveform, we used an optimal basis set of three waveforms (FLOBS: FMRIB's Linear Optimal Basis Sets, default FLOBS supplied in FSL (Woolrich et al., 2004a)). This allows us to have a more flexible HRF model that will account for differences in the HRF between regions of the brain within a single model. Although this approach may more accurately account for varying HRFs, it may lead to a small underestimation of the effect size as it does not account for changes in amplitude that may be seen when an HRF is temporally shifted.
