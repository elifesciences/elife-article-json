It ensures that the DNA, organelles and other components in a cell are correctly distributed between the two \"sibling\" cells that are produced during the cell division process. In most cases, the dividing cell ensures that the sibling cells are near identical in size. However, many types of cells, including baker\u2019s yeast and cells in animal ovaries, produce sibling cells of different sizes. How and why dividing cells regulate the sizes of the sibling cells are unresolved questions in cell biology\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Roubinet and Cabernard, 2014</a>). Now, in eLife, Cuie Chen, Mayu Inaba, Zsolt Venkei and Yukiko Yamashita of the University of Michigan report a new mechanism that dividing cells use to ensure that both sibling cells are equal in size (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chen et al., 2016</a>)."

During cell division, the chromosomes in a cell are divided into two groups by a structure called the spindle apparatus. In animal cells two organelles called centrosomes help to build the spindle apparatus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Nigg and\u00a0Raff, 2009</a>). It is important that the spindle apparatus is assembled correctly because asymmetric spindles could exert uneven spindle forces and may result in the sibling cells having incorrect numbers of chromosomes."

Decreasing the amount of Klp10A in these cells causes one of the centrosomes \u2013 presumably the older \"mother\" centrosome \u2013 to become much longer than normal. This, in turn, leads to the formation of asymmetric spindles and results in a new germline stem cell that is significantly larger than the gonialblast (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Despite the importance of centrosome activity for chromosome segregation, all of the chromosomes (except for the small fourth chromosome) segregate normally in Klp10A depleted germline stem cells."

(<b>A</b>)\u00a0Early in the cell cycle (during interphase; left column) the mother centrosome (green) in a fruit fly male germline stem cell is slightly more active than the other centrosome (red), which helps to anchor (brown) the stem cell to the hub cell (pale\u00a0purple). Later in the cell cycle (during metaphase and telophase) both centrosomes are equally active, organizing the microtubules to form a symmetrical spindle apparatus across the center of the cell. When the cell divides it produces a new germline stem cell and a gonialblast that are equal in size. (<b>B</b>) The mother centrosome in a Klp10A depleted germline stem cell is more active than the other centrosome in interphase, metaphase and telophase, which leads to an asymmetric spindle and siblings of different size. The larger cell remains attached to the hub cell, adopting stem cell fate, whereas the smaller sibling often dies. (<b>C</b>) Neural stem cells in fruit flies are intrinsically polarized (green and red crescent, respectively) and also contain asymmetric centrosomes, which result in an asymmetric spindle at telophase. The larger cell is destined to become the neural stem cell whereas the smaller cell becomes a ganglion mother cell. In contrast to germline stem cells, it is the asymmetric localization of motor proteins in neural stem cells during anaphase (between metaphase and telophase; not shown) that is largely responsible for producing sibling cells that are unequal in size. Small circles in\u00a0interphase cells represent cell nuclei; the chromosomes are not shown."

A possible explanation is that male germline stem cells \u2013 like other stem cells \u2013 segregate their centrosomes asymmetrically during cell division with the new stem cell always retaining the mother centrosome.

Chen et al. addressed this question by using live cell imaging to follow the fates of sibling cells in Klp10A depleted testes. These experiments revealed that the smaller gonialblasts often die. This is unlikely to be due to the mis-segregation of the fourth chromosome (because it is not essential for cells to survive; <a href=\"#bib5\">Gelbart, 1974</a>), but may be caused by differences in the segregation of organelles between the sibling cells. For example, the smaller gonialblasts inherit more mitochondria, but less Golgi, than the gonialblasts in normal testes."

They showed that changes in spindle position or the location of the metaphase plate (where chromosomes line up before the cell divides) can induce asymmetric division of animal cells that, under normal conditions, always produce equally sized siblings. Similar to the small gonialblasts in fruit fly testes, the smaller siblings died or spent longer preparing for cell division. There is currently no molecular explanation for how differences in sibling cell size could affect cell fate, but it is possible that altered segregation of cell organelles, a cell size checkpoint or cell competition may be responsible."

If neural stem cells are forced to divide symmetrically they produce two new neural stem cells of equal size\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Cabernard and Doe, 2009</a>). Similarly, some neural stem cells in the worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> also produce siblings of different sizes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ou et al., 2010</a>). In both of these examples, the difference in cell size seems to be primarily controlled through asymmetric localization of a motor protein called non-muscle myosin, which drives cell division, and not through inherent asymmetries in the spindle\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Ou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Cabernard et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib4\">Connell et al., 2011</a>).
