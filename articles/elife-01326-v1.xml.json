We investigated the roles that prior experience and hippocampal CA3 <i>N</i>-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity play in CA1 place cell sequence encoding and learning during novel spatial experiences. We found that specific representations of de novo experiences on linear environments were formed on a framework of pre configured network activity expressed in the preceding sleep and were rapidly, flexibly adjusted via NMDAR-dependent activity. This prior experience accelerated encoding of subsequent experiences on contiguous or isolated novel tracks, significantly decreasing their NMDAR-dependence. Similarly, de novo learning of an alternation task was facilitated by CA3 NMDARs; this experience accelerated subsequent learning of related tasks, independent of CA3 NMDARs, consistent with a schema-based learning. These results reveal the existence of distinct neuronal encoding schemes which could explain why hippocampal dysfunction results in anterograde amnesia while sparing recollection of old, schema-based memories."

We investigated the roles that prior experience and hippocampal CA3 <i>N</i>-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity play in CA1 place cell sequence encoding and learning during novel spatial experiences. We found that specific representations of de novo experiences on linear environments were formed on a framework of pre configured network activity expressed in the preceding sleep and were rapidly, flexibly adjusted via NMDAR-dependent activity. This prior experience accelerated encoding of subsequent experiences on contiguous or isolated novel tracks, significantly decreasing their NMDAR-dependence. Similarly, de novo learning of an alternation task was facilitated by CA3 NMDARs; this experience accelerated subsequent learning of related tasks, independent of CA3 NMDARs, consistent with a schema-based learning. These results reveal the existence of distinct neuronal encoding schemes which could explain why hippocampal dysfunction results in anterograde amnesia while sparing recollection of old, schema-based memories."

During development and childhood we learn a large repertoire of items that we encounter for the first time in our life, such as the names of things and how to perform certain tasks. This de novo learning process takes a relatively long time and generally requires repeated exposures to the particular features of the external world that are being learned. Later in life, when we are exposed to novel but related features, we acquire this new information much faster. For instance, if a child learns to associate various odors with various locations around the home\u2014such as associating the smell of bread with the kitchen and the smell air freshener with the bathroom\u2014they will find it easier to make new odor-place associations outside the home, such as associating gasoline with gas stations."

In particular, the interaction between a chemical called glutamate, which is released by sender neurons, and proteins called NMDA receptors (which bind the glutamate molecules) on receiver neurons have a central role in synaptic plasticity. Recently, based on experiments with rodents, it has been proposed that the hippocampus is also crucial for the formation of the mental schemas that can accelerate the learning of new spatial association tasks, such as the odor-place associations described above."

Using repeated exposures to novel spatial experiences and genetic techniques to block the NMDA receptors in this subregion in mice, Dragoi and Tonegawa discovered that de novo learning involves synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and, possibly, other regions of the brain. This de novo learning, in turn, enables subsequent spatial learning to be accelerated, even when the NMDA receptors are absent. These results reveal that de novo learning, and related learning processes such as accelerated learning, are underpinned by a number of different mechanisms in the brain, which could help explain why damage to the hippocampus prevents the formation of new memories while preserving other forms of memory and learning."

These mutant mice had their CA3 NR1 subunit knocked-out using a Cre/loxP recombination system (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tsien et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nakazawa et al., 2002</a>) and are referred to as the CA3 NMDAR KO, or simply KO mice.

We therefore investigated the temporal development of hippocampal place cell assemblies and the dynamics of behavioral performance in the CT (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tsien et al., 1996</a>) and KO mice (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nakazawa et al., 2002</a>) during de novo spatial exposure and the effect of this (prior) experience on cell assembly and learning dynamics during subsequent exposures to related novel space and behavioral tasks. De novo neuronal representations of spatial experiences were formed on the framework of the spontaneous network activity preceding the experience (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>) and were subsequently modified and rapidly stabilized via CA3 NMDAR-dependent activity. This prior experience on novel linear tracks accelerated the encoding of subsequent experiences on additional, contiguous or isolated novel tracks and eliminated or significantly reduced their CA3 NMDAR dependence, respectively. We evaluated the behavioral relevance of these neuronal dynamics by comparing them with the performance of na\u00efve and experienced CT and KO animals on a T-maze delayed alternation task. The presence of CA3 NMDARs facilitated the de novo learning of the alternation task; this prior experience accelerated subsequent learning of a related alternation task in a CA3 NMDAR-independent manner, consistent with principles of a schema-based learning (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bannerman et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tse et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">McKenzie et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, prior experience and CA3 NMDARs modulated the learning rate and the neuronal ensemble dynamics across experimental conditions in a correlated manner, suggesting that these neuronal dynamics, and in particular the expression of stable cell assemblies in CA1, might be part of the neural mechanisms of learning in na\u00efve and experienced animals."

The changes in single cell activity allow the quantification of the temporal development of place fields over successive exploratory sessions (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a> for individual cell examples for all three conditions), and the lap-by-lap correlation reflects the organization of neurons in coordinated cellular assemblies whose member pairs exhibit higher temporal correlation than pairs of independent neurons (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harris et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</a>).

An overnight holding in the home cage led to significantly increased spatial tuning in KO mice the next day (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, DnRun1 compared to FamRun1, 29.6 \u00b1 2.6 cm compared to 20.6 \u00b1 2.0 cm, p&lt;0.01).

This result indicates that the experience- and genotype-dependent changes in place field size reported above (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>) result from the spatial tuning of initially large place fields rather than from the scattering of large place fields into multiple smaller ones. At the neuronal ensemble level, there was a significant increase in the lap-by-lap correlations with increased experience for both genotypes, although the increase occurred faster in CT compared to KO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In the CT, but not KO mice, the increase reached a plateau by the second exploratory session (DnRun2) under the de novo condition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, DnRun1 compared to DnRun2, 0.37 \u00b1 0.007 compared to 0.48 \u00b1 0.01, p&lt;10<sup>\u221213</sup>, ranksum test in CT mice; 0.38 \u00b1 0.005 compared to 0.38 \u00b1 0.004, p=0.38 in KO mice; CT vs KO in DnRun2, p&lt;10<sup>\u22129</sup>, ranksum test). Although the correlations eventually reached stable CT levels in KO mice, this did not occur until the next day (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, DnRun1 compared to Fam, 0.37 \u00b1 0.007 compared to 0.48 \u00b1 0.01, p&lt;10<sup>\u221213</sup> in CT and 0.38 \u00b1 0.005 compared to 0.48 \u00b1 0.01 in KO, p&lt;10<sup>\u221210</sup>). These results suggest that the first-time spatial experience on a linear track leads to a gradual increase in spatial tuning and co-variation of ensembles of CA1 place cells encoding the novel experience, and that the temporal dynamics of these processes are facilitated by NMDAR-dependent activity in the auto-associative area CA3 of the hippocampus. The two run sessions of the de novo condition (over 1 hr altogether, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) may have provided enough time for the relatively slower non-NMDAR-dependent plasticity to occur and underlie the slower place cell dynamics. The results suggest that CA3 NMDAR-dependent activity and plasticity are specifically involved in the rapid within-session changes in single and ensemble place cell activity."

Surprisingly, for both genotypes, the new place fields were as spatially tuned during the first session (ContigRun) in the novel arm of the L-shaped track as in the contiguous familiar arm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,E</a>) and as in the preceding FamRun1 session (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). No additional spatial tuning could be detected within the ContigRun session within each group of mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>; FamRun1 compared to ContigRun: 22.1 \u00b1 1.7 cm compared to 23.9 \u00b1 1.7 cm, p=0.46 in CT and 20.6 \u00b1 2.0 cm compared to 21.9 \u00b1 1.1 cm, p=0.34 in KO), across genotypes (CT compared to KO, p=0.6 in FamRun1, p=0.46 in ContigRun), and for both the familiar and the novel portions of the L-shaped track (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, p&gt;0.05). The average number of place fields per place cell on the L-shaped track was similar across genotypes during ContigRun (CT vs KO, 1.90 vs 1.89, p&lt;0.98). Similarly, the increased lap-by-lap correlations observed in FamRun1 were preserved in the ContigRun session for both groups of mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,F</a>; FamRun1 compared to ContigRun, 0.48 \u00b1 0.01 compared to 0.47 \u00b1 0.009, p=0.41 in CT and 0.48 \u00b1 0.01 compared to 0.46 \u00b1 0.01, p=0.2 in KO), and there were no significant differences in the correlations between genotypes (CT compared to KO, p=0.98 in FamRun1, p=0.42 in ContigRun), nor between the familiar and the novel portions of the L-shaped track (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, p&gt;0.05). These results suggest that under the contiguous condition, independent of CA3 NMDARs, the spatial information regarding the previously unvisited novel portion of the L-shaped track was rapidly bound with the existing stable representation of the familiar track given the animals\u2019 prior experience on the familiar track. These rapid dynamics on the novel arm during the Contig session are in contrast to the slow dynamics of place field tuning and co-variation during de novo exposure to a novel track (i.e., the DnRun1 session for CT and DnRun1\u20132 sessions for KO). This may reflect the prior recruitment at a subthreshold firing level of the new place cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Epsztein et al., 2011</a>) into stable, tuned cortico-hippocampal cellular assemblies during pre-exposures to the familiar track, which manifested as preplay of the novel arm during the preceding sleep or resting epochs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2013</a>)."

In this case, exploration of the novel track induced a significant, albeit transient, increase in the CA1 place field length in KO but not CT mice (FamRun2 vs DisjRun1: 23.9 \u00b1 1.4 vs 23.9 \u00b1 1.5 cm in CT, p=0.9; 22.6 \u00b1 1.3 vs 28.9 \u00b1 2 in KO, p&lt;0.01, ranksum test; between genotypes, CT vs KO in DisjRun1, p&lt;0.05; DisjRun1 vs DisjRun2 in KO, p&lt;0.04, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; paired difference in place field length FamRun2\u2013DisjRun1 CT vs KO, p&lt;0.027, ranksum test, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; within-session DisjRun1, CT vs KO, p&lt;10<sup>\u22123</sup>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), consistent with an earlier report (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nakazawa et al., 2003</a>). The average number of place fields per place cell was slightly higher in CT compared to KO mice, but this relationship was not affected by the additional experience of animals on the novel track (CT vs KO: 1.76 vs 1.52 in DisjRun1 and 1.76 vs 1.47 in DisjRun2, p&lt;0.002). The increased lap-by-lap correlations recorded on the familiar track (FamRun2) decreased with novelty (DisjRun1) in KO but not in CT mice (FamRun2 vs DisjRun1: 0.49 \u00b1 0.006 vs 0.51 \u00b1 0.008, p&gt;0.05 in CT; 0.47 \u00b1 0.005 vs 0.41 \u00b1 0.004, p&lt;10<sup>\u221215</sup> in KO; DisjRun1: CT vs KO, p&lt;10<sup>\u221230</sup>; DisjRun1 vs DisjRun2 in KO, p&lt;10<sup>\u22124</sup>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The correlations returned to \u2018familiar levels\u2019 by the next session (DisjRun2) in the KO mice more rapidly compared to the de novo condition (compare DisjRun2 to DnRun2 in KO, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Overall, these dynamics were not due to differences in the velocity of animal movement across sessions or genotypes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), as place field size and lap-by-lap correlations were not significantly correlated with the animal velocity (p&gt;0.11 and p&gt;0.12, respectively). Moreover, the changes in place field tuning occurring within experimental sessions (i.e., DnRun1, DisjRun1, first vs last four laps) were not simply due to a change in the behavior of the mice during the corresponding sessions since their velocity and total distance travelled (path stereotypy) were similar in the first four laps compared with the last four laps of the sessions for both genotypes (first vs last four laps, p&gt;0.05, ranksum test; velocity, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, total distance travelled, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The changes in lap-by-lap correlations across experimental sessions were not simply a result of changes in animal behavior during the 3s-bin epochs since the distances travelled by the mice on the tracks during the 3s-bins were not correlated with the values of the lap-by-lap correlations calculated over the same timescale (p&gt;0.2). The overall changes in the spatial information of place cells (<a href=\"#bib53\">Skaggs et al., 1996</a>) between novel and familiar run sessions for individual CA1 place cells across genotypes and conditions were consistent with the changes in place field size and in lap-by-lap correlations of pairs of cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>)."

                                "text": "To further examine the structure of correlations during DisjRun1 exploration, we grouped pairs of place cells active on both FamRun2 and DisjRun1 sessions based on the change in the relative distance between their place field peaks across the two tracks into those with changes within 5 cm (stable assemblies, 8% CT, 10% KO pairs), those with changes between 6 cm to 20 cm (27% CT, 37% KO), and those with changes between 21 cm to 35 cm (32% CT, 26% KO). The remaining pairs, with changes larger than 35 cm were excluded from this analysis. In the CT mice, cells from all three groups displayed relatively high lap-by-lap co-variation during DisjRun1 exploration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). In contrast, in KO mice, only cells of the stable assemblies (within 5 cm change) maintained a high lap-by-lap co-variation during DisjRun1, while groups of pairs with changes larger than 5 cm exhibited significantly poorer co-variation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>, p&lt;0.05, ranksum test). These results suggest a modular, higher order organization of cellular assemblies, in which a certain group of cell pairs (stable assemblies) counters a complete NMDAR-dependent reorganization of the entire neuronal population in response to novel stimuli by maintaining their co-variation independent of CA3 NMDARs. This modular organization of cell assemblies was not simply based on the spatial proximity between place fields on the novel track as co-variations in the KO mice were significantly poorer than in CT mice for all three regimes of changes in place field distance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>, p&lt;0.05). A similar grouping of the cell pairs active in the contiguous condition during FamRun1 and ContigRun revealed that the changes in cellular ensemble organization upon exploration of the contiguous novel arm are CA3 NMDARs-independent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). The large proportion of cell pairs showing &gt;20 cm changes in their spatial relationship from familiar to novel tracks (&gt;65% in CT, &gt;53% in KO mice) indicates that the ensemble of place cells formed distinct representations across the two environments, a process called remapping (<a href=\"#bib40\">Muller and Kubie, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dragoi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Leutgeb et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2013</a>). Consistent with the remapping, the order in which the place cells fired in the familiar track (place cell sequences) was not correlated with their order of firing in the novel arm (contiguous condition, mean R<sub>CT</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.03, mean R<sub>KO</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.12, p&gt;0.05, both genotypes) or novel track (disjunct condition, mean R<sub>CT</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.11, mean R<sub>KO</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.12, p&gt;0.05, both genotypes), whereas it was similar to the order in which they later fired in the familiar arm of the L-shape track (contiguous condition, R<sub>CT</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.6, R<sub>KO</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.5, p&lt;0.05, both genotypes)."

Spiking events (<a href=\"#bib17\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2013</a>) were detected for each sleep/rest session in the sleep/rest box as increases in multiunit activity (at least five of the place cells active during the corresponding run session) that were preceded and followed by &gt;100 ms of silence. For each spiking event, a rank-order correlation between the place cell sequence template and the temporal sequence of cell firing during the event was calculated for each direction of runs and for each session and experimental condition in both CT and KO mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013F</a>). The event was considered significant if the correlation of its firing sequence with the corresponding place cell sequence template exceeded the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile of a distribution of correlations when the order of the place cells in the novel track template or novel arm template was shuffled randomly 100 times (i.e., p&lt;0.025). For each direction of run, preplay (i.e., pre-Run play) refers to an event\u2019s temporal sequence during pre-Run sleep/rest that has a significant correlation with the spatial cell sequence of the subsequent run session. Likewise, post-Run play or replay refers to an event\u2019s temporal firing sequence during post-Run sleep/rest that has a significant correlation with the spatial cell sequence of the preceding run session. Events significant for both running directions were assigned only to the direction with the higher absolute correlation value."

At the level of individual animals, with the exception of one CT mouse (CT2, preplay &gt; replay, p&lt;10<sup>\u22124</sup>, ranksum test), the absolute values of the correlations of the significant events with the spatial templates of the very first run session on the novel track (i.e., DnRun1) were similar for the spiking events occurring during the pre-DnRun1 sleep/rest session (i.e., when preplay occurs) compared to those occurring during the post-DnRun1 session (i.e., when replay occurs), both in CT and KO mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Aa</a>, p&gt;0.05, ranksum test).

In order to address this question, we constructed spatial templates from the activity of place cells in the first four laps of run (early templates) and the last four laps (late templates) and correlated them with the temporal sequences recorded during the previous sleep (i.e., early and late preplay). We found that the population of early template correlations was not different from the population of late ones in both CT and KO mice (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, both early and late spatial-temporal correlations were higher in the KO mice compared with the CT ones (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results indicate that the relative instability of the place fields during DnRun1 session is associated with a process of relatively mild \u2018editing\u2019 of the early template, rather than with a process of dramatic \u2018remapping\u2019 into a new chart. The relatively high correlation between early and late place fields in the de novo condition (0.4\u20130.5) is consistent with this scenario."

This finding is consistent with the overall reduced experience-dependent changes in the correlation values in KO (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B,D,F,H and 5C</a>) and indicates a reduced flexibility (increased rigidity) of the hippocampal network in the absence of NMDAR-dependent activity in the CA3 region.

In this task, the animals had to retrieve food rewards placed at the end of left vs right arms of the T-maze in alternate trials. The animals self-initiated the trials, moved toward the reward site and returned on the same path to re-initiate the next trial. Delays between trials were counted as the time between returning from the end of the left/right arms and self-initiation of the next trial (&gt;10 s). Both groups of animals reached the criterion level of performance of 70% correct choices during the 10-day training (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Analysis of the data from both genotypes during the 10-day training using a balanced two-way ANOVA test (five blocks of 2 consecutive days) revealed a significant effect of the training day (F = 11.83, p=0.006) and genotype (F = 10.5, p=0.001) and a marginal duration (day) \u00d7 genotype interaction (F = 3.24, p=0.057). Consistent with the difference in the neuronal dynamics across genotypes during the de novo condition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>, left), the KO subjects required additional sessions to reach the 70% criterion for learning to alternate (9 vs 7 days, KO vs CT, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; days 7\u20138 block, CT vs KO, 78.1% vs 53.7% correct, p=0.006, ranksum test) indicating the involvement of the intrinsic hippocampal circuitry in the acquisition of this task. Moreover, consistent with the facilitation of neuronal dynamics on the novel arm by prior experience on the familiar track during the contiguous condition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>, middle), this learning experience greatly accelerated (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tse et al., 2007</a>) the acquisition of a similar alternation task in a second, novel T-maze configuration, when both groups of animals performed above threshold by the second day of re-training (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, day 10 vs 12, 78.2% vs 77.6% correct, p=0.9 for CT, and 72.2% vs 75.7% correct, p=0.6 for KO, ranksum test). Together, these results establish a correlation between the neuronal activity and the behavioral performances across genotypes and experimental conditions and suggest that the dynamics of cell assembly organization are part of the underlying mechanisms of spatial learning."

In the contiguous and disjunct condition paradigms, although the spatial location and orientation of the novel linear track are as new to the animals as in the de novo condition paradigm, both the geometry (i.e., linear tracks) and the behavioral experience (i.e., repetitive runs for food rewards) are common. These parameters may have already been internalized prior to the novel run session, which may have diminished the dynamic interplay between the internal and external drives and facilitated the formation of more stable spatial representations on the novel arm/track. More importantly, the repeated access to the familiar arm in conjunction with the exploration of the novel arm in the contiguous condition accelerated the recruitment and stabilization of neuronal firing sequences independent of CA3 NMDARs; this likely happened through complementary, non-CA3 NMDAR-dependent plasticity or through NMDAR-dependent activity in other brain regions (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kentros et al., 1998</a>). The CA3 NMDAR independence in the contiguous condition did not solely result from increased experience with linear tracks, as exploration of isolated novel tracks by the even more experienced animals during the disjunct condition did require, transiently, these receptors for the rapid formation of stable, tuned place cell sequences. In the disjunct condition, since exposure to the novel track occurred in the same general spatial environment, modules of place cells that remapped together, possibly controlled by common external stimuli (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2004</a>), were regrouped in a CA3 NMDAR-dependent manner to rapidly form the new representation. We hypothesize that this regrouping process observed in the disjunct condition makes the need for CA3 NMDARs only transient and thereby facilitates the formation of a new spatial representation based on the prior experience. A more drastic change in the external stimuli in the absence of prior animal training (like in the de novo condition where animals were shifted for the first time from the sleep/rest box to the linear maze) may lead to a more complete CA3 NMDAR-dependent recruitment and stabilization of neuronal ensemble activity, a slower formation of new spatial representations, and a slower learning."

More importantly, in the absence of CA3 NMDAR-dependent activity, the CA1 temporal firing sequences appear more rigid and their correlations with the place cell sequences are less modulated by the recent experiences compared to control animals. Overall, in the absence of CA3 NMDARs, the event correlations with future place cell sequences exhibit lower variance and higher values than in the presence of CA3 NMDARs. These results indicate that the organization of cellular assemblies in the CA1 area is influenced by the NMDAR-dependent activity in the upstream CA3 area. In the absence of this type of activity/plasticity, the CA1 cellular assemblies are less affected by the animals\u2019 novel spatial experiences and maintain an increased correlation across different brain states (i.e., across sharp-wave/ripples during sleep and theta during run), behaviors, and experiences.

Here we show that upon familiarization with a novel linear track, the lap-by-lap correlations between place cell pairs increase rapidly during the exploratory session in control animals but remain low for several exploratory sessions in the absence of CA3 NMDARs. These results suggest that NMDAR-dependent activity within the CA3 area of the hippocampus is involved in the rapid organization and linking of CA1 place cells in cellular assemblies during the encoding of a first-time and of subsequent isolated novel experiences on linear tracks, but is not necessary for the general expression of temporal sequences of place cells in the CA1 in the form of preplay and replay."

A spiking event (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>) was defined as a transient increase in the firing activity of a population of at least five different place cells within a temporal window preceded and followed by at least 100 ms of silence. For all conditions, the spikes from all the place cells active during run that were emitted during the preceding and following sleep/rest were sorted by time and further used for the detection of the spiking events. For the calculation of the temporal sequence, the times of the first spike emitted by each of the cells participating in the spiking event were sorted to determine the temporal order of neuronal firing (<a href=\"#bib9\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</a>). All four CT and three KO animals exhibited a significant number of spiking events in the sleep/rest sessions of the de novo condition, three CT and four KO animals exhibited a significant number of spiking events in the contig condition, whereas all three CT and three KO mice exhibited a significant number of spiking events in the Disjunct condition. The remaining animals had a below threshold number of simultaneously active CA1 place cells. The place cell sequences (templates) were calculated for each direction of the animal\u2019s movement and for each run session in all experimental conditions by ordering the spatial location of the place field peaks that were above 1 Hz. For place cells with multiple place fields above 1 Hz on a particular arm or track in the contiguous condition, only the place field corresponding to the peak firing rate of the place cell on that arm or track was considered for the construction of the template of that particular arm or track. This method is consistent with previous studies that employed spatial templates to demonstrate replay (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee and Wilson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</a>) and preplay (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>) during sleep or awake rest. Place cells with fields on both the novel arm in the ContigRun session and the familiar track in the FamRun1 session participated in the construction of both the novel arm and familiar track templates. Statistical significance was calculated for each event by comparing the rank-order correlation between the sequence of cells\u2019 firing in the event (i.e., event sequence) and the place cell sequence (template) and the distribution of correlation values between the event sequence and 100 surrogate templates obtained by shuffling the order of place cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>). The significance level was set at 0.025 to control for multiple comparisons (i.e., the two directions of run). The proportions of significant events (preplay and replay) were calculated as the ratio between the number of significant events and the total number of spiking events in which at least five corresponding place cells were active (<a href=\"#bib9\">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>). Ripple oscillations were detected during sleep/rest periods in the sleep/rest box. The EEG signal was filtered (120\u2013200 Hz) and ripple-band amplitude was computed using the Hilbert transform. Ripple epochs with maximal amplitude higher than four standard deviations above the mean, beginning and ending at one standard deviation were detected."

The place cell activity was not partitioned in place fields, rather the whole activity on the particular track or arm was considered separately for each cell and direction (average correlations are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>). In addition, we performed the same type of correlations while shuffling the identity of the cell in one member of the correlation (once for each different cell). Shuffle results were computed as correlation between spatial tuning of cells on the novel arm (or novel track) during the beginning of ContigRun (or de novo and disjunct runs) and spatial tuning of all the other simultaneously recorded cells on the novel arm (or novel track) during the end of ContigRun (Novel arm group) or de novo and disjunct runs.

Lack of evidence for preplay could occur for two reasons, either: offline sequences of the target spatial representation were not generated, or the template shifted during learning (e.g., remapping) so that attempts to identify sequence matches are frustrated by changes in the template with experience. We know that in control mice, spatial firing changes more during a first experience than in KOs, therefore, it may be important to construct multiple templates for the first session, one early and one late, with the assumption that preplay would be equivalent in controls and KOs when the early template is used though preplay would be diminished in the late template due to CA3 NMDAR dependent plasticity that altered the order of place fields, as suggested in the cartoon in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>."

As argued, if place fields were unimodal, then indeed a great deal of the structures of the spatial representation would be predetermined; however, based on the examples provided, there seems to be a great deal of firing that is out of order, so-to-speak. According to the model set forth by the authors, this out-of-order firing ought to depend upon plasticity incurred during experience, and therefore may be less stable in control mice as compared to CA3 KOs."

Why must the structure be dictated by a uniform generic distribution rather than reflecting recall of specific, related experiences (see McKenzie and Eichenbaum, Neuron 2011 and other recent commentaries on memory updating, e.g., Dudai)? Along the same line, the authors also argue that the rapid tuning of firing fields in control mice is evidence of schema modification. The authors should also consider a highly relevant experimental report (McKenzie et al., J Neurosci 2013) that specifically addressed how a neural correlate of memory changes with new related learning and the experimental conditions necessary for addressing the neural basis of schema modification."

We found that in na\u00efve and experienced mice, novel CA1 place cell sequences exhibit similar correlations with their firing sequences during sleep/rests following and preceding the run, indicating network stability homeostasis. The tuning and spatial reliability coordination of place cell ensembles on novel tracks were reduced in na\u00efve animals and showed accelerated increases in compared to experienced mice ones. Genetic blockade of CA3 NMDAR-dependent plasticity resulted in more rigid temporal-spatial sequences between sleep and exploratory behaviors and delayed tuning and coordination of place cell ensembles. These results indicate that novel spatial representations develop on the framework of preconfigured hippocampal networks whose homeostatic adjustment reorganization is accelerated by prior experience and CA3 NMDAR-dependent activity plasticity. The increased place map stability, tuning, and cell-assembly expression coordination may underlie rapid memory consolidation of repeated/related new experiences, but not of entirely novel ones.\u201d"

Lack of evidence for preplay could occur for two reasons, either: offline sequences of the target spatial representation were not generated, or the template shifted during learning (e.g., remapping) so that attempts to identify sequence matches are frustrated by changes in the template with experience. We know that in control mice, spatial firing changes more during a first experience than in KOs, therefore, it may be important to construct multiple templates for the first session, one early and one late, with the assumption that preplay would be equivalent in controls and KOs when the early template is used though preplay would be diminished in the late template due to CA3 NMDAR dependent plasticity that altered the order of place fields, as suggested in the cartoon in</i> <a href=\"#fig7\"><i>Figure 7</i></a>."

The reviewers are asking how this relative instability of place fields (i.e., correlations of 0.4-0.5) in the very first run session of na\u00efve animals affects the correlation between the spatial and temporal sequences of place cells (i.e., preplay and replay), here referred to as \u201cspatial-temporal correlations\u201d.

We found that the population of early template spatial-temporal correlations was not different from the population of late template ones in both control and mutant mice (revised <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). However, both early and late spatial-temporal correlations were higher in the KO mice compared with the control ones (revised <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with our results in revised <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. These results indicate that the relative instability of the place fields during the first run is associated with a process of mild \u201cediting\u201d of the early template as illustrated in revised <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, rather than with a process of dramatic \u201cremapping\u201d into a new chart as hypothesized by the reviewers. The relatively high correlation between early and late place fields in the de novo condition (0.4\u20130.5) is consistent with this scenario. Please also note the majority of significant correlations (preplay and replay) do not reach an absolute value of 1; this means, for example, that an early template and an edited late template could both have significant spatial-temporal correlations of 0.7 value with the same spiking event from the preceding sleep. A remapped late template would have spatial-temporal correlations values comparable with the shuffled ones, \u223c0.2. Finally, we have explained in more detail in a previous publication (Dragoi and Tonegawa, Nature 2011) that an insufficient density of place cells per unit of linear track along with an insufficient sampling of spiking events in the pre-run sleep session will prevent the detection of preplay events."

Regarding the relative contribution of entorhinal layer III and of CA3 area inputs to the activity of CA1 place cells, several studies have now shown that these inputs are not necessary for the expression of place cells in the CA1, despite both of them sending convergent inputs onto CA1 (works from the Moser and the Tonegawa labs). The highly periodic pattern of grid cell activity and the rather persistent activity of border cells might not make them the best candidates to study p/replay in these cells, at least not by simply employing the conventional spatial-temporal sequence analysis that is being widely used for CA1 place cell sequences."

Expressed one on the familiar arm and one on the novel arm (Fam x Novel).
