Its diversity-generating retroelement (DGR) provides a naturally occurring phage-display system, but engineering efforts are hampered without atomic structures. Here, we report a cryo electron microscopy structure of the BPP-1 head at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution. Our atomic model shows two of the three protein folds representing major viral lineages: jellyroll for its cement protein (CP) and HK97-like (\u2018Johnson\u2019) for its major capsid protein (MCP). Strikingly, the fold topology of MCP is permuted non-circularly from the Johnson fold topology previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. We illustrate that the new topology is likely the only feasible alternative of the old topology. \u03b2-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chainmail in BPP-1, unlike covalent inter-protein linkages of the HK97 chainmail. Despite these complex interactions, the termini of both CP and MCP are ideally positioned for DGR-based phage-display engineering."

Its diversity-generating retroelement (DGR) provides a naturally occurring phage-display system, but engineering efforts are hampered without atomic structures. Here, we report a cryo electron microscopy structure of the BPP-1 head at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution. Our atomic model shows two of the three protein folds representing major viral lineages: jellyroll for its cement protein (CP) and HK97-like (\u2018Johnson\u2019) for its major capsid protein (MCP). Strikingly, the fold topology of MCP is permuted non-circularly from the Johnson fold topology previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. We illustrate that the new topology is likely the only feasible alternative of the old topology. \u03b2-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chainmail in BPP-1, unlike covalent inter-protein linkages of the HK97 chainmail. Despite these complex interactions, the termini of both CP and MCP are ideally positioned for DGR-based phage-display engineering."

The RNA bacteriophage MS2 subunits have a fourth structure, not yet found in eukaryotic viruses (<a href=\"#bib38\">Valegard et al., 1990</a>). The HK97 fold is present not only in a large number of dsDNA bacteriophage capsids, including the T-phages, lambdoid phages, etc, but also in the major capsid protein of eukaryotic herpesviruses (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bamford et al., 2005</a>). In HK97 itself, the intersubunit contacts are reinforced by a post-assembly covalent linkage\u2014an isopeptide bond between adjacent gp5 subunits, so positioned that the entire capsid is topologically interlinked in a \u2018chainmail\u2019 arrangement (<a href=\"#bib10\">Duda, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wikoff et al., 2000</a>). In other cases, such as bacteriophage \u03bb, the non-covalent interactions between the subunits are reinforced by an additional \u2018cement\u2019 protein, which binds on the outer surface of the capsid at positions close to those of the isopeptide bonds in HK97 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lander et al., 2008</a>).

As such, BPP-1 is a naturally occurring diversity-generating system and can be engineered to display foreign proteins with adaptive heterologous sequences. An atomic description of the BPP-1 head will enhance bioengineering efforts, reveal non-covalent molecular interactions conducive of stable bacteriophage capsid formation, and clarify evolutionary relationships of BPP-1 MCP and CP with proteins in other viruses."

To identify the genes coding for MCP and CP, we first carried out SDS-PAGE analysis and showed that the two most abundant protein bands have molecular masses of 36.3 kD and 15.2 kD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the bands correspond to Bbp17 and Bbp16, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The theoretical molecular masses of Bbp17 and Bbp16 (i.e., 36417.2D and 14458.3D) match their apparent molecular masses by SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the two capsid proteins in the mature bacteriophage particles are not cleaved (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Finally, to verify that genes <i>bbp16</i> and <i>bbp17</i> encode components essential for forming infectious phage particles, we constructed in-frame deletions of the <i>bbp16</i> and <i>bbp17</i> genes. As expected, no infectious phage particles were produced from BPP-1\u0394<i>brt</i> lysogens carrying deletions in <i>bbp16</i> or bbp<i>17</i>, confirming that both MCP (Bbp17) and CP (Bbp16) are required for phage production. For the sake of clarity and ease of comparison with structural homologs of other viruses, we will continue to use CP and MCP to refer to Bbp16 and Bbp17 of BPP-1, respectively. As shown below, these assignments are directly verified through atomic modeling in which side-chain structures of amino acid residues in sequences match side-chain densities visualized in the cryoEM map (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

The quality of MCP and CP densities was further improved by additional averaging of seven CP or six hexameric MCP subunits (except for the pentameric MCP) in the asymmetric unit (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zhang et al., 2010a</a>). Based on the reference-based Fourier shell correlation criterion (FSC = 0.143), the resolution of the capsid is 3.58 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>). Consistently, the R-factors of atomic models are better than 0.5 at the zone of 1/3.5 \u00c5 (for capsid) or 1/3.4 \u00c5 (for averaged CP and MCP) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), which correspond to a Fourier shell correlation (FSC) coefficient greater than 0.143 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wolf et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, the resolution of the capsid and averaged densities were estimated to be \u223c3.5 \u00c5 and \u223c3.4 \u00c5, respectively. This assessment of resolution is also consistent with clearly visible side chain densities of bulky amino acid residues, such as arginine and phenylalanine (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D and 4E\u2013F</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2\u20134</a>)."

MCP alone forms a complete icosahedral shell without any noticeable gaps. CP forms dimers bound to the underlying MCP shell at local and icosahedral twofold axes, making the maximum diameter of the BPP-1 (670 \u00c5) bigger than that of the HK97 capsid (659 \u00c5). When CP dimers are computationally removed, the overall size and architecture of the BPP-1 capsid is almost identical to that of the HK97 capsid, and the backbone model of the HK97 capsid is nearly super-imposable with the BPP-1 density map with minor mismatches. Based on the averaged density maps of CP and MCP, we built initial atomic models of CP and MCP with Coot (<a href=\"#bib11\">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</a>), and refined them with Phenix (<a href=\"#bib4\">Adams et al., 2010</a>). Models of the seven MCP and CP monomers within the asymmetric unit were subsequently obtained by adjusting the initial MCP and CP models with Coot and refined with Phenix, with overall R/R-free factors of 0.26/0.27 at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

This structural motif was first discovered in spherical RNA viruses (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harrison et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abad-Zapatero et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hogle et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rossmann et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chelvanayagam et al., 1992</a>), and subsequently found widely in other DNA viruses, such as \u03d5X174, bacteriophage PRD1 and human adenovirus (<a href=\"#bib28\">McKenna et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Abrescia et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zubieta et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Krupovic and Bamford, 2011</a>). Unlike its role as the major capsid protein in the above-mentioned viruses, the jellyroll motif in BPP-1 forms an auxiliary protein to stabilize the viral capsid made by proteins of another fold. Notably, in some dsRNA viruses, the jellyroll motif has been adopted as a domain in a stabilizer/adaptor protein that forms trimers located at an intermediate layer of viral capsids (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grimes et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mathieu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Liemann et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Zhang et al., 2010a</a>). In BPP-1, CP subunits form a dimer through \u03b2-sheet augmentation between the F-strands of two CHEF sheets, forming an 8 stranded \u03b2-sheet visible on the external surface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Although the BIDG sheet of the jellyroll motif faces but do not interact with the underneath MCP shell, instead, as described in detail below, CP interacts with the MCP shell mainly through its N- and C-termini as well as a linking loop between its \u03b2-strands B and C."

Although little sequence identity (CLUSTALW score = 5) was detected between BPP-1 MCP and HK97 gp5 proteins with ClustalW (<a href=\"#bib37\">Thompson et al., 1994</a>), the overall architecture of the MCP resembles that of HK97 gp5 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wikoff et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), with an axial (A) domain, a peripheral (P) domain and an extended loop (E-loop) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Both the subunit organization and domain orientations of the seven MCPs in the BPP-1 capsid are also identical to those of the corresponding gp5 subunits in the HK97 capsid. The A-domain contains a 5-stranded \u03b2 sheet flanked by two helices on one side and a C-terminal loop on the other. The P-domain contains a characteristic long, 7-turn helix sandwiched by a three-stranded \u03b2 sheet and the N-terminal loop. The E-loop contains a single amino acid sequence segment folded into an extended hairpin loop projecting from a 2-stranded \u03b2 sheet.

Firstly, the conformations of the N-terminal loops are different (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1, 2C</a>). In BPP-1 MCP, the N-terminal peptide extends radially to interact with a CP by augmenting its CHEF \u03b2-sheet. In HK97 gp5, the N-terminus extends circumferentially and interacts with three adjacent gp5 subunits, augmenting a \u03b2-sheet in one of them. Secondly, a C-terminal loop (Lys293\u2013Val309) of the pentameric MCP in BPP-1 is disordered while the corresponding loop (Arg294\u2013Thr304) in the HK97 pentameric gp5 is ordered (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wikoff et al., 2000</a>). Thirdly, the electrostatic potential properties of the two proteins are strikingly different. Finally, and perhaps most interestingly, the folding topologies of BPP-1 MCP and HK97 gp5 are different, which, as described below, provides the first opportunity to explore possible alternative ways to build the highly conserved HK97-like folds (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>)."

A careful comparison of the two structures has led us to identify three structural elements of the canonical HK97-like, or \u2018Johnson\u2019 fold: N-, \u03b2- and \u03b1-elements (marked cyan, purple and green in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A\u2013D and 5A\u2013C</a>). These three structural elements join together through a central 5-stranded (F, E, G, K, L in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>, in an up-up-down-up-up topology) \u03b2-sheet, flanked by two short helices (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The \u03b2-element (purple) consists of two anti-parallel (i.e., G, K; down-up) \u03b2-strands forming a hairpin located at the middle of the Johnson fold. The \u03b1-element (green) contains two parallel (i.e., F, E; up-up) \u03b2-strands and the two short helices. The N-element (cyan) contributes the last (i.e., L; up) \u03b2-strand to the Johnson fold and also contains the two other characteristic secondary structures of the Johnson fold: a long, kinked \u2018spine\u2019 \u03b1-helix and the extended loop (E-loop)."

To verify this, we swapped the \u03b1 and \u03b2 structural elements in our de novo BPP-1 MCP model to create an \u2018interchanged model\u2019 that matches the HK97 topology. This \u2018interchanged model\u2019 was then refined with Phenix for five cycles. Despite this refinement effort, the final \u2018interchanged model\u2019 does not agree with our experimental cryoEM density (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In particular, many side chains in the \u2018interchanged model\u2019 do not match those resolved in the cryoEM density map (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B,C</a>). This verification provides additional support to the BPP topology established by our de novo modeling approach."

From a pure mathematical point of view, permuting three structural elements can give rise to a total of six different topologies (i.e., 3! = 6), considering that sequence polarity (N- to C-termini) of the structural elements must be preserved. However, the N-element (cyan) cannot participate in this permutation due to the remote disposition (\u223c42 \u00c5) of its N-terminus with respect to the C-termini of other structural elements, and thus the total possible topologies is reduced to only 2 (i.e., 2! = 2) and the permutation is non-circular (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1A\u2013B, 2G\u2013H</a>). Remarkably, the newly discovered BPP topology presented here is therefore the second topology predicted from the above rule (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), the first being the topology discovered in HK97 gp5 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wikoff et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and subsequently seen in many other viruses, as well as in bacteria and archaea cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Akita et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sutter et al., 2008</a>). Insertions into any of the three structural elements can give rise to more complex architectures without increasing the number of folding topologies of the Johnson fold, as would be expected for larger viral particles such as the herpesvirus capsid."

Complementary electrostatic potential surfaces were also identified at the interface between CP and MCP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). Each CP interacts extensively with five MCP subunits underneath, mainly involving three loops: (a) N-terminal loop, (2) C-terminal loop, and (3) the linking loop between strands C and D of the jellyroll motif (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013F</a>). Firstly, the N-terminal loop of CP interacts with two MCPs: the N-terminal loop of first MCP (green) and the E-loop of the second MCP (yellow) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013E</a>), Secondly, the C-terminal loop of CP interacts with two MCPs: a \u03b2-strand of the \u03b2-element of the first MCP (orange) and both N- and C-terminal loops of a second MCP (green) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013E</a>). Thirdly, the linking loop of CP interacts with three MCPs: two \u03b2-strands of the \u03b2-element of the first MCP (blue), the N-terminal loop of a second MCP (green) and a short loop (Asn48\u2013Glu52) of the third MCP (orange) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013E</a>). Fourthly, \u03b2-strand C of CP jellyroll interacts with the N-terminal loop of an MCP, augmenting the CHEF \u03b2-sheet of CP (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Finally, two CP monomers form a dimer through anti-parallel interaction between their F-strands of jellyrolls, forming an augmented, 10-stranded \u03b2 sheet and further stabilizing the capsid (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C, 7D and 9C</a>)."

Moreover, the topology of the Johnson fold in BPP-1 MCP is non-circularly permuted as compared to the previously known topology of the Johnson fold. Until now, the Johnson fold has been observed at atomic detail in the <i>Siphoviridae</i> and <i>Myoviridae</i> families of the three tailed-bacteriophage families, exemplified by gp5 of HK97 (<i>Siphoviridae</i>) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wikoff et al., 2000</a>) and gp24 of T4 (<i>Myoviridae</i>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fokine et al., 2005</a>). Our atomic model derived from the 3.5 \u00c5 cryoEM map of BPP-1 represents the first atomic model for a virus in the third tailed-bacteriophage family, the <i>Podoviridae</i>. Indeed, BPP-1 represents the first among all viruses shown to contain both the jellyroll and HK97-like folds. In the virosphere, the conventional wisdom is that viruses have evolved from a few distinctive lineages separately. Three major lineages have been proposed based on three highly distinctive structures: jellyroll-like (i.e., jellyroll lineage, include single- and double-jellyroll), HK97-like (i.e., HK97 lineage) and BTV-like (i.e., BTV lineage), and members of each lineage contain MCPs with conserved folds originating from a common ancestor (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rossmann and Johnson, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bamford et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Abrescia et al., 2012</a>).

Indeed, we observed infectious phage particle formation when either CP or MCP was fused to a peptide of 22 amino acids at their C-terminus (HG and JFM, unpublished observation). As BPP-1 DGRs diversify DNA sequences in vivo, this suggests they may be engineered to display heterologous sequences on the phage capsid by fusion to the termini of CP or MCP. For DGR-based phage-display, the diversity of the DNA library is not limited by the efficiency of DNA transformation, and both the library construction and optimization can occur entirely inside bacterial cells without the need for in vitro manipulation. Moreover, the selected phage particles can be easily re-amplified for iterative selection since the tail, not the engineered head, is involved in phage-receptor recognition. The atomic model of the BPP-1 head presented in this study provides a road map forward to harness the great potentials afforded by the unique properties of BPP-1 for phage-display engineering."

But the RNA phage structure (1990) showed right away that you could make a perfectly nice, T=3 capsid with a different fold. Amusingly enough, that fold has only been found in RNA phage. Anyhow, the dsRNA viruses and HK97 show two more designs, although most of the dsRNA viruses have another protein (e.g., VP6 of rotavirus) that does have a jellyroll. So while it remains puzzling why jellyrolls show up in so many non-enveloped viruses, playing the \u201cmy fold is more curious/novel/interesting than your fold\u201d game is silly."

The HK97 fold is present not only in a large number of dsDNA bacteriophage capsids, including the T-phages, lambdoid phages, etc., but also in the major capsid protein of eukaryotic herpesviruses. In HK97 itself, the intersubunit contacts are reinforced by a post-assembly covalent linkage - an isopeptide bond between adjacent gp5 subunits, so positioned that the entire capsid is topologically interlinked in a \u201cchainmail\u201d arrangement. In other cases, such as lambda, the non-covalent interactions between the subunits are reinforced by an additional \u201ccement\u201d protein, which binds on the outer surface of the capsid at positions close to those of the isopeptide bonds in HK97.

Visual comparison of the maps is obviously the most useful criterion, and that is indeed the criterion on which the authors have largely relied. Use of the Scheres\u201cgold standard\u201d might be helpful to assess the resolution more correctly. Even if the authors choose not to do that calculation, full FSC and R-factor curves should be shown because their shapes sometimes indicate problems with the refinement, e.g., over-fitting."

To expand the shell by \u0394R = 1 \u00c5, probably a reasonably tolerable range for the intermolecular forces holding the shell together (the circumference would change by 6 \u00c5, distributed over more than six intersubunit contacts as you go around, so any intersubunit interface would stretch by less than 1\u00c5, even assuming that the subunits themselves were utterly inextensible), the DNA would do work P\u0394V \u223c 4 x 10^-18 Joules or 2400 kJ/mole (taking 300 \u00c5 as the radius). That seems a lot, but it is only about 5.5 kJ/mole of subunit (there are 420), or roughly the strength of an extra H-bond (i.e., 1.5 kcal/mole). Not particularly impressive. So the chainmail of HK97 is probably not about withstanding \u201cenormous forces\u201d, but rather about withstanding the slings and arrows of the slime through which the poor phage particle must pass to get from one bacterial host to another. That doesn't make the alternative strategies of cement protein and isopeptide bond less interesting \u2013 but it is important to avoid hyperbole based on intuitive macroscopic analogies."

In particular, as the altered connections are at the surface of the particle, where local disorder, etc., could obscure correct links, they should show that any plausible sequence register for the HK97-like trace is not possible. One simple way to do this would be to examine a series of possible alternative sequence registers for residues following the first of the \u201cnon-HK97-like\u201d connections and show that the pattern of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues is completely different. In other words, that if you look at the possible sequence registers for the long beta-hairpin that runs parallel to the long helix (probably just 4-5 alternative starting and ending points), do any of them look plausible enough to test by the refinement criteria that Zhang et al. use for their trace? A suitable figure showing various sequence registers might be all that is needed to make this point."

All T=7 capsids examined so far are laevo; if BPP-1 turned out to be dextro, this would be another distinctive feature (what is epsilon 15?). ii) When considering subunit folds of different lineages, many authors differentiate between the single jellyroll fold observed in the first ssRNA virus structures determined and the double jellyroll found in dsDNA viruses infecting all three domains of life. When multiple jellyrolls from RNA viruses are in a single polypeptide chain like the large subunit of cowpea mosaic virus or all 3 subunits of tobacco ring spot virus they clearly appear as \u201cbeads on string\u201d, while the double jelly roll structure integrates the two domains into a contiguous protein. iii) The authors state that BPP1 probably has a different assembly and maturation pathway compared to HK97. In order to make this statement meaningful they need to discuss the scaffolding protein of BPP1 and any intermediates in maturation that may have been characterized. HK97 has a covalently associated scaffold that is proteolytically removed during maturation. Is there any sequence of events known for BPP1? If not, that statement should be softened."

The catenated rings observed in BPP-1 have the same topology as that in HK97, except that the MCP subunits within each ring interact non-covalently instead of covalently as in HK97. We find that non-covalent chainmail serves to capture the key elements of the complex nature of the molecular interactions we observe in the BPP-1 and other phages. One can also apply the description of noncovalent chainmail to what others have observed in a number of bacteriophages (see, for example, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> of Lander et al.).
