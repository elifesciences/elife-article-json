However, this comparison may be contaminated by non-specific attention, alerting, performance, and reporting confounds. Here, we pursue a novel approach, tracking the neuronal coding of consciously and unconsciously perceived contents while keeping behavior identical (blindsight). EEG and MEG were recorded while participants reported the spatial location and visibility of a briefly presented target. Multivariate pattern analysis demonstrated that considerable information about spatial location traverses the cortex on blindsight trials, but that starting \u2248270 ms post-onset, information unique to consciously perceived stimuli, emerges in superior parietal and superior frontal regions. Conscious access appears characterized by the entry of the perceived stimulus into a series of additional brain processes, each restricted in time, while the failure of conscious access results in the breaking of this chain and a subsequent slow decay of the lingering unconscious activity."

However, this comparison may be contaminated by non-specific attention, alerting, performance, and reporting confounds. Here, we pursue a novel approach, tracking the neuronal coding of consciously and unconsciously perceived contents while keeping behavior identical (blindsight). EEG and MEG were recorded while participants reported the spatial location and visibility of a briefly presented target. Multivariate pattern analysis demonstrated that considerable information about spatial location traverses the cortex on blindsight trials, but that starting \u2248270 ms post-onset, information unique to consciously perceived stimuli, emerges in superior parietal and superior frontal regions. Conscious access appears characterized by the entry of the perceived stimulus into a series of additional brain processes, each restricted in time, while the failure of conscious access results in the breaking of this chain and a subsequent slow decay of the lingering unconscious activity."

Even when they reported that they were guessing, participants identified the location of the line better than by chance, indicating unconscious perception on \u2018guess\u2019 trials. This enabled Salti et al. to compare how the brain encodes consciously perceived and unconsciously perceived stimuli."

A classifying algorithm was trained on a subset of the data to recognize from the recorded brain activity where on the screen a line had appeared. Applying this algorithm to the remaining data revealed the dynamics of stimulus encoding. Consciously and unconsciously perceived stimuli are encoded by the same neural responses for about a quater of a second. From this point on, consciously perceived stimuli benefit from a series of additional brain processes, each restricted in time. For unconsciously perceived stimuli, this chain of processing breaks and a slow decay of encoding is observed."

The first branch, which studies the \u2018state of consciousness\u2019, focuses on general vigilance or a person's ability to perceive, interact, and communicate with the environment, by examining the regulation of sleep and waking, and their pathological disruption by coma, epilepsy, and sleep disorders (<a href=\"#bib35\">Laureys et al., 2004</a>). The second branch of inquiry, which studies \u2018access to consciousness\u2019, focuses on the processes that make a specific content subjectively experienced\u2014what differences in brain activity distinguish conscious vs unattended or subliminal stimuli (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dehaene et al., 2006</a>). To a large extent, both endeavors rely on characterization of the neural activity that underlies the conscious state or conscious perception, and they are traditionally approached in a similar manner (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dehaene and Changeux, 2011</a>). In order to examine the neuronal processes that underlie conscious states, the neuronal activity associated with one state of consciousness (e.g., sleep) is compared to another (e.g., awake). Similarly, in order to extract the neural correlates of conscious perception, threshold-level stimuli are presented to the subject such that they are sometimes consciously perceived and sometimes not. Trials are then sorted according to their subjective perception (\u2018Seen\u2019 or \u2018Unseen\u2019), and the neurophysiological signatures associated with these categories are contrasted to extract the correlates of consciousness perception."

First, differences in neural activity may stem from physical differences in the stimuli. To control this, many experiments now employ identical stimuli and rely on participants' subjective reports to differentiate seen and unseen conditions. Even then, stimuli also differ in their depth of processing: performance is typically much higher for conscious trials (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lau and Passingham, 2006</a>), and several operations may only be feasible in the conscious state (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sackur and Dehaene, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">De Lange et al., 2011</a>). The main effect of seen vs unseen trials may, therefore, reveal processing differences unrelated to the actual cerebral encoding of a conscious or unconscious stimulus, and reflecting solely, the operations that precede follow or even coincide with conscious access (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aru et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pitts et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fr\u00e4ssle et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pitts et al., 2014</a>)."

The broad contrast between brain activity on \u2018seen\u2019 vs \u2018unseen\u2019 trials may include generic processes of attention, alerting, or reporting that should be carefully kept distinct from the more limited set of processes that represent the current mental content. For instance, the late P3 component of event-related potentials, which is a frequent signature of conscious perception (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dehaene and Changeux, 2011</a>), has been proposed to reflect either a non-specific alerting effect arising from noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2005</a>) or the activation of generic reporting processes unnecessary to conscious perception itself (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pitts et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2014</a>). To resolve this issue, it is necessary to identify which patterns of brain activity, unique to conscious trials, faithfully encode the contents of subjective experience and to separate them from other non-specific brain responses (<a href=\"#bib22\">Haynes, 2009</a>)."

Some theories propose that subjective experience emerges from a generic pattern of brain activity without any stimulus-specific change (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lau and Rosenthal, 2011</a>). According to these models, the cognitive representation of a stimulus is built during unconscious perception, and the additional activity that gives rise to consciousness tags it as \u2018perceived\u2019 but adds no perceptual or coding benefit. Conversely, other models (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dehaene et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2006</a>) suggest that conscious perception relies on a massive amplification and cortical broadcasting of stimulus-specific information. The Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) model asserts that perceptual stages may unfold identically on conscious and non-conscious trials, but that, when a stimulus gains access to consciousness, stimulus-specific information is amplified and re-encoded in additional areas, including a prefrontal\u2013parietal network. This \u2018workspace\u2019 maintains the information online and dispatches it to additional processors, thus making the stimulus reportable. This view predicts that, ceteris paribus, additional stimulus information should be present on conscious trials. Finally, theories that associate conscious perception with posterior visual loops (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lamme, 2006</a>) or with the integration of information into a coherent whole (<a href=\"#bib42\">Oizumi et al., 2014</a>) are agnostic with respect to this issue: although greater reverberation or integration may cause an amplification of neuronal activity, (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fahrenfort et al., 2012</a>) it could also, on the contrary, lead to diminished or sparser activity due to the greater predictability of the distributed brain signals being integrated (<a href=\"#bib17\">Friston, 2005</a>)."

To fulfill this demanding agenda, we used time-resolved MEG and EEG recordings to track the internal representation of a flashed stimulus under visible and invisible conditions. This strategy was made possible by advances in multivariate decoding, which can detect stimulus-specific information in brain activity, and evaluate its localization (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kamitani and Tong, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Haynes and Rees, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Haynes, 2009</a>) and its time course (<a href=\"#bib24\">King and Dehaene, 2014</a>). We chose visual location as the decoded parameter of the stimulus, because multiple macroscopic retinotopic maps are present throughout the human brain, including the frontal lobe (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sereno et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hagler and Sereno, 2006</a>), and therefore, the full cortical processing stream of this parameter should be more easily decodable than other more microscopic parameters, such as object identity. To further address the concern of differences in processing depth, we placed ourselves under \u2018blindsight\u2019 conditions by asking subjects to perform a forced-choice location task in which performance was excellent even on subjectively invisible trials. Selecting only the correct trials allowed us to compare visible and invisible trials with identical stimuli and responses (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lamy et al., 2009</a>)."

This result is striking for two reasons; first, it allows us to broaden the concept of blindsight as observed in V1 lesioned patients (<a href=\"#bib63\">Weiskrantz, 1996</a>) and monkeys (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cowey and Stoerig, 1995</a>) or induced in normal subjects (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lamy et al., 2009</a>). In blindsight, above-chance forced-choice behavior indicates that the observer perceived the stimuli, even though he denies any subjective perception. Here we can see that, even when subjects fail to perform the forced-choice task, their brain still perceived and retained the spatial information. Although unconscious perception is considered as transient and short-lived (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rossetti, 1998</a>), here we see that even with the lowest end of perception, spatial information is encoded for up to 800 ms."

To examine whether our study replicated those findings, we compared the event related potentials (ERP) - event related fields (ERF) signatures of our critical conditions (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We tracked the components by computing Global Field Power and applied cluster analysis across channels. While the \u2018Unseen\u2013Correct\u2019 vs \u2018Unseen-Incorrect\u2019 did not yield any significant difference in evoked responses, the \u2018Seen\u2013Correct\u2019 vs \u2018Unseen\u2013Correct\u2019 did: MEG magnetometers showed different activities in the N2 time window, while EEG electrodes showed a difference in the P3 time window, with the appropriate topography (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, these late events again appear as correlates of conscious perception. Unsurprisingly, ERP-ERF analysis revealed a slightly different temporal pattern than the dynamics revealed with the multivariate classification, because the former corresponds to a search for generic brain states allowing or not allowing content to access consciousness, while the latter corresponds to a search for brain states encoding a specific consciously perceived content."

Our results suggest that, in the present experiment, M/EEG recordings are dominated by content-specific information about location, both on seen and on unseen trials, while it is more difficult to train a generic decoder for seen/unseen trials that cuts across all such contents. It also should be noted that this experiment was not optimally designed for such an analysis. In order to restrict classifier to using attributes that are related exclusively to visibility and not to stimuli location, we equated the number of trials representing specific stimulus location in the \u2018Seen\u2013Correct\u2019 and the \u2018Unseen\u2013Correct\u2019 location.

To evaluate this possibility, we performed a control analysis in which we applied the decoder to target absent trials in which no stimulus appeared, but subjects still had to produce a response. Classification of subjects' responses in these trials was at chance, indicating that the previous decoder focused strictly on stimulus-based location information (see <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Although it remains possible that conscious response planning modulates the late stages of location processing, several aspects of our experiments argue against a contribution of motor codes to our results. In terms of experimental design, our main analyses focused on trials in which the decoder was trained to extract the objective location of the target on all trials, errors included. Thus, the above-chance extraction of the objective target location on \u2018Unseen-Incorrect\u2019 trials is not likely to reflect motor code, nor can the improved classification performance for \u2018Seen\u2013Correct\u2019 over \u2018Unseen\u2013Correct\u2019, since those trials involve exactly the same stimuli and responses."

Although eye movements were carefully removed with principal component analysis (PCA), it could be suggested that residual ocular activity in the MEG/EEG (MEEG) signal governed the classification of spatial location. Residual eye movement artifacts, if present, should primarily affect the anterior eye channels. To test this possibility, we examined the dynamics of classification on electro-oculograms (EOG) channels alone. Classification revealed a different temporal pattern of classification that was observed with the full MEEG classification: above-chance location decoding started only around 250 ms, remained much lower that with the whole data set (\u223c14%, where chance = 12.5%), and crucially, did not discriminate between the seen and unseen trials (see <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), suggesting that eye movements did not play a dominant role in the above decoding results.

In this case, if conscious and unconscious codes differ, then training specifically on unconscious trials should revert the pattern and yield better decoding on unseen compared to seen trials. The GNW model (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dehaene et al., 2003</a>), however, makes a different prediction concerning the asymmetry of decoding on seen and unseen trials. Specifically, the model predicts that all the processing stages present on unseen trials should continue to be observed on seen trials, while the converse should not be true: on seen trials, there should be brain activity encoding the perceived stimulus within the GNW and not present on unseen trials."

One technical difficulty was that, since the experimental conditions were defined by subjects' responses, the number of trials at each location was no longer balanced within each of these conditions, and this imbalance affected the pre-stimulus bias of the 8-category classifier as well as its capacity to generalize. To address this problem, we turned to a simpler binary classifier, which was trained to simply sort the stimuli into left-hemifield vs right-hemifield stimuli. Within each subject, we matched the number of trials in these two classes and also selected equal numbers of seen\u2013correct and unseen\u2013correct trials. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> shows that this binary decoder, now operating with a chance level of 50%, still performed above chance with approximately the same time course as the 8-location decoder."

In order to assess the contribution of these brain areas to the encoding of consciously perceived contents, we modeled the brain activity in 68 regions of interest covering the whole cortex (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and re-trained our decoders using just the distributed source signals from these regions. The results with eight output classes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) confirmed the existence of two main stages: an early one (\u223c100\u2013200 ms) where location information was essentially confined to occipital, ventral visual, and lateral and mesial parietal regions, and a later one (&gt;250 ms) where it became highly distributed to multiple cortical areas, particularly in prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To avoid an unnecessary increase in the number of statistical tests, we confined the subsequent analyses of seen and unseen trials, to four a priori regions of interest covering all areas of the dorsal visual pathway containing retinotopic maps for location (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sereno et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hagler and Sereno, 2006</a>): pericalcarine, superior parietal cortex, rostral medial frontal cortex, and superior-lateral frontal cortex. We then repeated the generalization across conditions and procedures. This region-based decoding revealed the activation of successive spatial codes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>): both pericalcarine and superior parietal cortices contained decodable information as early as 115 ms post stimuli ([0.519 \u00b1 0.005], t(11) = 3.82 p = 0.0028 and [0.516 \u00b1 0.003], t(11) = 4.52 p &lt; 0.0001, respectively). The two frontal areas revealed a more delayed pattern as the curve associated with superior frontal cortex showed first above-chance decoding only after 194 ms (0.504 \u00b1 0.001), t(11) = 2.33 p = 0.0396 and rostral medial frontal as late as 365 ms."

Importantly, however, our results show that there is no specific region uniquely dedicated to the encoding of consciously perceived information. Instead, a better encoding on seen trials is obtained in the same overall sectors of the superior parietal cortex and superior frontal cortex that also contain location information on unseen\u2013correct trials (i.e., blindsight trials). Again, the key difference is asymmetrical generalization, indicating the presence of superior encoding of spatial information on seen trials, only in dorsal parietal and frontal regions. This pattern primarily occurs in the late time window (beyond 270 ms), but it is already present at early stages of processing in the superior parietal cortex."

On unconscious trials, the accumulation of incoming activation would fail to attain the critical threshold level needed to trigger such a discrete series of stages (\u2018failed ignition\u2019), and the unconscious information would, therefore, decay over a period of a few hundreds of milliseconds (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dehaene and Naccache, 2001</a>)."

If the representation is stable, the classifier should remain efficient even if applied at a different latency. If, however, the information is successively re-encoded in a series of different brain systems, then we should see a failure of generalization beyond a certain temporal duration (i.e., away from the diagonal where <i>t</i> = <i>t\u2032</i>) (<a href=\"#bib24\">King and Dehaene, 2014</a>). We, therefore, quantified the endurance of conscious and unconscious representations by training and testing classifiers on all pairs of time samples (<i>t,t\u2032</i>). To measure a classifier's durability independently of classification efficacy, we defined Classification Endurance (CE), as the number of samples forward and backward in time, for which decoding performance remained above 50% of its level at the original training time (t = t\u2032)\u2014that is, the decoder's half-life time."

Beyond this point and up to \u223c800 ms post stimulus, classifiers generalized to a wider neighborhood of latencies, consistent with the entry of information into evidence accumulation systems with longer time constants. The generalization pattern was examined using an analysis of variance conducted on CE in the 272\u2013800-ms time window with factors of Visibility (Seen/Unseen), Direction (Forward/Backward in time), and Timeframe (5 successive time windows) (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for statistics). All main effects and their interactions were significant. On average, CE was larger for generalization forward than for generalization backward and also increased in time. We were mainly interested in the different generalization patterns of the \u2018Seen\u2013Correct\u2019 and \u2018Unseen\u2013Correct\u2019 trials. Surprisingly, generalization was more extended in time for unseen trials.

                                "text": "<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> shows a possible theoretical interpretation consistent with those results. The high level of decoding observed on seen trials, over a long time window of \u223c270\u2013800 ms, combined with a low level of off-diagonal temporal generalization beyond a fixed horizon of \u223c160 ms, implies that a conscious location is successively encoded by a series of about four distinct stages, each terminating relatively sharply after a processing duration of \u223c160 ms. Conversely, the lower decoding level and longer endurance observed for unconsciously perceived stimuli indicate that they do not enter into the same processing chain. The square pattern of the temporal generalization matrix on unseen trials (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) suggests that unconscious information lingers in a single representational state, which decays slowly over time, thus yielding a paradoxically longer endurance than on seen trials in the forward direction. All of these findings are consistent with the above predictions as well as with earlier decoding results indicating a chain of additional processing stages unique to conscious trials (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charles et al., 2014</a>). They suggest that conscious access can be described as the entry of information into a dynamic routing system (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sackur and Dehaene, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dehaene et al., 2014</a>) in which information is stabilized, transferred to a processor, exploited in a determined time, and then transferred again to the next stage. As described in accumulation-of-evidence models of decision making (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shadlen and Kiani, 2011</a>), a failure to attain a threshold-level activation at one of these stages cuts the process short, prevents the attainment of a conscious-level representation, and causes the information to linger and decay."

However, this comparison may be contaminated by non-specific attention, alerting, performance, and reporting confounds. The quest for brain mechanisms of consciousness implies an isolation of neural populations that encodes the details of subjective experience (<a href=\"#bib22\">Haynes, 2009</a>). As an effort in this direction, we applied multivariate decoding techniques in order to track the neural encoding of a conscious or unconscious representation of stimulus location through time. To control over stimulus and performance confounds, we capitalized on the blindsight phenomenon and selectively analyzed a large fraction of trials with identical stimuli and accurate responses, which differed only in subjective reports of seeing or not seeing the stimulus."

This finding is coherent with the existence of multiple spatial maps in occipital, parietal, and frontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sereno et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hagler and Sereno, 2006</a>). (2) Seen and unseen stimuli are initially encoded identically, but after \u223c270 ms, the information is selectively amplified on \u2018seen\u2019 trials. This observation replicates and extends earlier observations with seen and unseen words, digits and pictures during masking (<a href=\"#bib12\">Del Cul et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fisch et al., 2009</a>), and the attentional blink (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sergent et al., 2005</a>). (3) Asymmetrical generalization indicates that shared spatial codes are active on unconscious and conscious trials, but that conscious trials also contain additional neural codes for stimulus location that are absent or weaker on unconscious trials. Source localization traces those conscious codes to superior parietal and superior frontal cortex. While the present method does not allow us to decide whether the difference is quantitative (the same codes are activated more strongly) or qualitative (additional neural codes are recruited), they are convergent with the prior observation that, of the many maps for space in the cortex, superior parietal and frontal maps are selectively amplified by attention, while earlier retinotopic maps are activated in an automatic manner (<a href=\"#bib52\">Saygin and Sereno, 2008</a>). (4) The dynamics of cortical coding, as revealed by temporal generalization matrices (<a href=\"#bib24\">King and Dehaene, 2014</a>), also differs on seen and unseen trials: conscious information undergoes a series of representational transformations, such that each decoder fails to generalize beyond \u223c160 ms, while unconscious information, although weaker, generalizes over a longer period."

The observed characteristic peak-to-end duration of about 160 ms is also compatible with the finding that conscious percepts tend to be locked to an ongoing theta (\u223c4<i>\u2013</i>7 Hz) or high delta (\u223c1<i>\u2013</i>3 Hz) rhythm (<a href=\"#bib39\">Melloni et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Doesburg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nakatani et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sitt et al., 2014</a>), which is also the frequency range of slow positive event-related potentials, such as the P3. Doesburg et al. found that perceptual switching in a binocular rivalry paradigm corresponds to the emergence of synchronized gamma rhythm embedded in theta envelope (<a href=\"#bib13\">Doesburg et al., 2009</a>). In an attentional blink paradigm, the synchrony of fast oscillations (beta and gamma) with slow activity (theta and high delta) increased with practice, in parallel to improved stimulus visibility (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nakatani et al., 2014</a>). Theta activity was also shown to be higher on visible trials compared to invisible trials in a masking paradigm (<a href=\"#bib39\">Melloni et al., 2007</a>) and was successfully used to classify conscious vs vegetative patients (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sitt et al., 2014</a>). It thus seems plausible that conscious information is able to enter into a series of computational stages that are betrayed by a series of theta- or delta-like peaks (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dehaene and Sigman, 2012</a>). Conversely, unconscious information fails to be sequentially dispatched to the successive steps of a serial task and, therefore, remains blocked within a fixed representational state, where it slowly decays. Behavioral priming studies confirm that unconscious information lingers at detectable levels for hundreds of milliseconds (<a href=\"#bib19\">Greenwald et al., 1996</a>) or even seconds (<a href=\"#bib59\">Soto et al., 2011</a>)."

These results are highly convergent with intracranial local-field potentials and single-neuron recordings during binocular rivalry and continuous flash suppression (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sheinberg and Logothetis, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kreiman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Panagiotaropoulos et al., 2012</a>), which indicate that late neural discharges in higher cortical areas reflect which of two rivaling images are subjectively perceived. In the case of object identity, decodable neural activity is found in inferior and anterior temporal cortex (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sheinberg and Logothetis, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kreiman et al., 2002</a>) but also in prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Panagiotaropoulos et al., 2012</a>) as reported here. Thus, this region appears at the confluence of conscious perception of object identity and location, making it a primary candidate for the integrated perception of a unified conscious scene or event (<a href=\"#bib42\">Oizumi et al., 2014</a>)."

Figuratively speaking, one may say that previous studies have extracted the \u2018canvas\u2019 on which conscious perception is painted, while our approach is aimed at extracting the \u2018painting\u2019 itself. Nevertheless, this approach suffers from several limitations. One of them is the low level of decodability achieved: single-trial EEG and MEG responses have a low signal-to-noise ratio, which limits our inferences and would not afford, for instance, a reliable brain\u2013computer interface. Another limit of our design is that it reduces the rich experience associated with conscious perception to a single feature of a very lean stimulus, presented at threshold, which is the sole focus of attention and which is reported on every trial. Whether the present results would generalize to broader real-life situations, especially in the absence of an overt report is an important question for further research. Some recent experiments suggest that removing the need to report radically reduces the neurophysiological correlates of conscious perception, including the P3b component of event-related potentials, leaving only a posterior mid-latency component (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pitts et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fr\u00e4ssle et al., 2014</a>). However, many of those experiments involved a dual task, which is known to delay and dilute late ERPs (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sigman and Dehaene, 2008</a>) and to distort conscious access (<a href=\"#bib38\">Marti et al., 2010</a>). It might be preferable to adopt a \u2018passive attentive\u2019 paradigm involving mere attention without report. In such an auditory paradigm, late ERPs including the P3b component were again found to contain decodable information about the conscious percept (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wacongne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">King et al., 2013</a>). A correlation of late neurophysiological activity with perceptibility was also obtained in a variety of neurophysiological studies of human visual perception (<a href=\"#bib49\">Quiroga et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kouider et al., 2013</a>) or rodent tactile perception (<a href=\"#bib1a\">Manita et al., 2015</a>). With due caution, we, therefore, hypothesize that the neurophysiological correlates of conscious perception uncovered here might be generalized to other experimental conditions."

A trial was considered as a \u2018Seen\u2019 trial if the participant reported that he/she had seen the target and had correctly localized it, or if he/she reported the target as seen, failed to correctly localize it, but detected the error. We used a modified version of the threshold estimation procedure described by Levitt (<a href=\"#bib36\">Levitt, 1971</a>), changing mask contrast according to participant's \u2018Seen\u2019 trials proportion in a block. We manipulated contrast by adjusting the pixel intensity values in a unified fashion. Initial intensity was set to 230 (range 0\u2013255). The number of trials in each block increased as calibration persisted, so the first two blocks comprised four trials, the third block six trials, the forth eight trials, and from the fifth block on, all blocks comprised ten trials. The change in Red Green Blue (RGB) values was determined by the proportion of seen trials in a block, and the number of calibration blocks that participant had already completed. The maximal possible change after a single block was 80. This kind of change was applied when the proportion of seen trials was either 1 or 0. However, this maximal value decreased as the number of blocks participant has completed increased. The stopping rule for the calibration was that RGB change was smaller than 1.5, or subjects had completed 80 trials."

Since the experimental conditions were defined by subjects' responses, the number of trials at each location was no longer balanced within each of these conditions, and this imbalance affected the pre-stimulus bias of the 8-category classifier as well as its capacity to generalize. To address this problem, we turned to a simpler binary classifier, which was trained to simply sort the stimuli into left-hemifield vs right-hemifield stimuli. Within each subject, we matched the number of trials in these two classes and also selected equal numbers of seen\u2013correct and unseen\u2013correct trials. Similarly to the previous analysis, for each perceptual condition, the data were divided into fifteenfolds; the classifier was trained on 14 and tested on the one left out and additionally on the converse perceptual condition."

This parcellation is based on cortical curvature patterns that are estimated from individual MRI surface reconstructions. While these are large regions, the precision of MEG source reconstruction, combined with the requirements of the decoding approach, does not afford a very small focus. Smaller regions generally did not contain enough reconstructed dipoles with distinctive information to support accurate decoding. Neuronal current sources underlying single-trial MEG and EEG signals were estimated using linear minimum-norm estimates with fixed cortical source orientations. A three-layer volume conductor model based on individual head geometry was used in the forward computations (MNE-Suite [<a href=\"#bib18\">Gramfort et al., 2014</a>] Matlab toolbox). Noise covariance was estimated from the baseline periods of all accepted trials. We then ran an individual decoding analysis for each of the 68 regions. The estimated current distribution within a ROI at a given latency was fed to the same SVM analyses as for the sensor-level data. The results with eight output classes confirmed the existence of early focal and late distributed location-coding stages (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To avoid an unnecessary increase in the number of statistical tests, we confined the subsequent analyses of seen and unseen trials, to four a priori regions of interest: pericalcarine, superior parietal cortex, rostral medial frontal cortex, and superior-lateral frontal cortex. In the latter case, the decoder outputs were calibrated class probabilities for \u2018Seen\u2013Correct\u2019 and \u2018Unseen\u2013Correct\u2019 classes after 10-fold cross-validation."

A second analysis was aimed to check whether superior posterior decoding probability for the \u2018Seen\u2013Correct\u2019 correct trials rose from eye movements.

Generalization beyond the experimental situation should consider whether the dynamics revealed here could be generalized to other features of the same stimuli, to other stimuli and to other tasks, including passive viewing. Here we set a methodological and theoretical framework and establish preliminary results. Obviously, a lot of additional work is needed to address these points of concern. We have added a final paragraph to the Discussion where we discuss the limits of our findings and argue, cautiously, that similar dynamics would be found if we had used clearly visible stimuli without any overt response. We base this conclusion on parallels with other experiments, for instance using the auditory local-global paradigm, where similar findings of a late activity correlated with conscious perception was observed even in the absence of any overt report. We do note, however, that there is a current debate in the literature concerning this very issue. A discussion of those points has been added in the final paragraph:"
