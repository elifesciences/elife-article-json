Critical differences may reside in the mean strength of responses to visual stimuli, as reflected in bulk signals detectable in fMRI, EEG or MEG studies, or may be more subtly composed of differentiated activity of individual sensory neurons. Quantifying single-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to visual stimuli recorded with <i>in vivo</i> 2-photon imaging, we found that visual detection correlates more strongly with population response heterogeneity rather than overall response strength. Moreover, neuronal populations showed consistencies in activation patterns across temporally spaced trials in association with hit responses, but not during non-detections. Contrary to models relying on temporally stable networks or bulk-signaling, these results suggest that detection depends on transient differentiation in neuronal activity within cortical populations."
