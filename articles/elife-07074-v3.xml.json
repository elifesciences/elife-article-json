Bacteria without these three pathways were engineered and then grown under oxygen-deprived conditions. This experiment produced 91 new mutants that each had the wrinkly spreader phenotype. Further experiments revealed that together these mutants represented 13 previously unrecognized ways that the \u2018wrinkly spreader\u2019 phenotype can evolve."

Further work could investigate whether these principles can help us to predict the course of evolution in other biological contexts, such as in the evolution of antibiotic resistance."

Every time the ancestral SM genotype of SBW25 is placed in a nutrient-rich static microcosm, metabolism-driven depletion of oxygen imposes strong selection for mutants that colonize the oxygen replete air\u2013liquid interface (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The most successful of various mat-forming types (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ferguson et al., 2013</a>) display a wrinkled morphology on agar plates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and are known collectively as wrinkly spreaders (WS). In a previous experiment, the mutational origins of 26 independent WS genotypes were unravelled (<a href=\"#bib37\">McDonald et al., 2009</a>). All mutations resided in one of three pathways (Wsp, Aws, and Mws). Each pathway harbours a di-guanylate cyclase (DGC) responsible for production of cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP). When the cognate DGC is constitutively activated, cells over-produce an acetylated cellulose polymer (<a href=\"#bib50\">Spiers et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2003</a>)\u2014the proximate cause of the WS phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">McDonald et al., 2009</a>).

Such a spectrum of mutations made sense given that loss-of-function mutations in each negative regulator resulted in constitutive activation of the DGC (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goymer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Malone et al., 2007</a>), with ensuing downstream effects (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">McDonald et al., 2009</a>).

All 22 (7 unique) base pair substitutions (BPSs) were clustered in the region 1223\u20131340 of the open reading frame upstream of the DGC domain. Further disruptive mutations within PFLU0085 were identified including in-frame deletions (20 mutants, 3\u2013477 bp) and a 141-bp duplication\u2014all in the same 1223\u20131340 region\u2014suggesting that a wide variety of disruptive mutations within a small window can produce WS.

One mutation (R321L) was found in PFLU0956 close to the third predicted transmembrane helix preceding the DGC domain. A similar pattern was evident at PFLU3448 where two mutations affecting the same amino acid (A200V and A200T) were identified. This residue resides close to the last of seven predicted transmembrane helices. At PFLU3571, two mutations were identified\u2014both with W13R substitutions in the first of two transmembrane helices. A third mutation in PFLU3571 was found in the C-terminal end of the HAMP domain close to the N-terminal part of the DGC domain. The relative rarity of these mutations compared to those in PFLU0085 suggests a reduced target size that is again inconsistent with a negative regulatory role. More likely, these mutations bring about changes in protein\u2013protein interactions, changes in localization of diguanylate cyclases in the cell, or alterations in the relative orientation of domains. All such alterations could reasonably activate production of c-di-GMP (and thus cellulose) without increasing catalytic rate. The fourth gene\u2014that encoding PFLU5960\u2014contained a mutation (D160G) in the DGC domain itself. The affected amino acid is close to the active site (amino acids 200\u2013205) based on a Phyre2 structure prediction model (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</a>) of the protein (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Such a mutation likely increases catalytic activity of the imperfect GSDEF site."

Such mutations could lead to an increase in transcription by promoter capture, or may change the functional or regulatory connections of the protein resulting in activation of the associated DGC. For PFLU0183, eight deletions were identified: each generating an in-frame fusion with a putative fatty acid desaturase (PFLU0184) located upstream. Eight deletions generating in-frame fusions were also found between PFLU4306 and PFLU4305. PFLU4306 encodes a DGC domain protein and the upstream gene encodes a putative L-lactate dehydrogenase. A third example was defined by a single mutation that fused the GGDEF domain protein PFLU4308 to PFLU4313\u2014the latter located upstream of the DGC and encoding a hypothetical protein. This last fusion involved deletion of four intervening genes. For two of the loci WS-generating mutations arose at frequencies similar to those in promoters, suggesting that gene fusions and promoter capture play a major evolutionary role in gene and/or protein evolution."

This has a number of implications. Firstly, our findings contribute to the growing number of studies that show that parallel phenotypic evolution is often underpinned by parallel genetic changes (see [<a href=\"#bib51\">Stern, 2013</a>] <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> for a summary) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jost et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Blount et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gerstein et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Herron and Doebeli, 2013</a>). However, whereas it is common to attribute such genetic parallelism to selection, our work suggests the need for caution: genetic architecture can be a significant contributory factor. It is even conceivable, within the bounds of population parameters, such as population size and mutation rate, that certain high fitness phenotypes are never realized because of genetic bias."

These rules are consistent with the concept of \u2018target size\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hansen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gompel and Prud'homme, 2009</a>), which can be formulated more specifically in terms of size of the gene and the likelihood that changes generate viable phenotypes. The latter depends on the opportunity for loss-of-function mutations to generate adaptive phenotypes, which, in turn, depends on the function of the gene. But it is clear that while evolution will proceed most readily via loss-of-function mutations (where possible), other kinds of genes that afford a much reduced target size cannot be overlooked. As we demonstrate, there exists opportunity for promoter mutations, gene fusions, and activating mutations to also contribute to new phenotypes, but with a greatly reduced likelihood."

After non-selective growth in KB, 10 mg/l tetracycline was added to inhibit the growth of cells that had lost the pUIC3 insert. After 2 hr 1000 mg/ml cycloserine was added to kill growing cells and enrich for cells that had lost pUIC3 with the tetracycline resistance marker and incubated for 4 hr at 28\u00b0C. Suitable dilutions were then plated on agar plates with X-gal to allow screening for loss of the <i>lacZ</i> gene on pUIC3.

It's quite interesting that there are so many different di-guanylate cyclases that can be co-opted with just a single mutation, in so many different ways. They also present nice data showing that some newly revealed WS mutations confer similar fitness advantages to the normally dominant versions, and that the putative promoter mutations do increase mRNA levels (sometimes by extremely large amounts). There are many types of evolutionary pathways revealed here, and the text also interprets them for the reader e.g., the type of mutation(s) involved and whether they destroy a function or create a new function, and what that function is. The literature on experimental evolution is actually pretty poor about noting the difference between evolution of new or altered function, versus evolution to destroy a function, but this paper makes the distinction clear; that is just one of its many attributes. Another is the fact that the selection leads to a single phenotype with a clear adaptive interpretation; many studies of experimental evolution have described the DNA bases of favored changes yet fail to connect them to a clear beneficial phenotype."

These \u201cprinciples\u201d sounded so detailed as to miss important mutation types that happened not to occur in this system. For example, the evolution of antibiotic resistance through horizontal gene transfer, or evolution via chromosome duplication through chromosomal mis-segregation. Maybe, the general principle is what the authors wrote in their Discussion: the observed frequency of an evolutionary strategy is determined by the probability of the particular type of mutation and the fitness advantage conferred by such a mutation. Thus, loss-of-function mutations in non-essential genes will be far more common than reduction-of-function mutations in essential genes, which will be more common than gain-of-function mutations (unless it is through chromosome duplication or horizontal gene transfer, which can occur at a high frequency)."

As it stands, the paper falls into a presentation mode that is common when there are many data to summarize: a shopping list of case studies is described in the text, one by one. The conceptual framework of the presentation in this manuscript is clear, but there is too much detail to follow.

For the most part others have been interested in compensatory evolution (underpinned by spontaneous mutation, or in vitro mutagenesis) as a means of restoring a lost function in the hope that new knowledge functional knowledge will emerge. For us the motivation comes from recognition that the standard explanation for parallel evolution (strong selection) is but one of a number of possible explanations for the repeated occurrence of the same phenotypic and even genotypic solutions to a common selective challenge. The problem, as others and we have pointed out, is to come up with an experimental model along with a sensible design to rigorously address the question as to the number of pathways that evolution (in a given context) can follow. This in and of itself is no trivial matter. To the best of our knowledge we have performed a unique experimental analysis and one that we hope will interest the evo-devo community, as much as to the field of experimental microbial population biology."

Thus, loss-of-function mutations in non-essential genes will be far more common than reduction-of-function mutations in essential genes, which will be more common than gain-of-function mutations (unless it is through chromosome duplication or horizontal gene transfer, which can occur at a high frequency)</i>."

Because the suggested classifications are based on interpretation of the mutational patterns (and not biochemical or biophysical data) it will not be possible for the reader to evaluate our claims without detailed descriptions and interpretations about the context of mutations in each gene. As this section is about 10% of the text in the article, we believe a further reduction would lead to a minor improvement in readability while seriously impacting the credibility of our conclusions."
