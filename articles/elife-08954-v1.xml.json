Mice with ablation of Epithelial splicing regulatory protein (Esrp1) develop cleft lip and palate. Loss of both Esrp1 and its paralog Esrp2 results in widespread developmental defects with broad implications to human disease. Deletion of the Esrps in the epidermis revealed their requirement for establishing a proper skin barrier, a primary function of epithelial cells comprising the epidermis. We profiled the global Esrp-mediated splicing regulatory program in epidermis, which revealed large-scale programs of epithelial cell-type-specific splicing required for epithelial cell functions. These mice represent a valuable model for evaluating the essential role for AS in development and function of epithelial cells, which play essential roles in tissue homeostasis in numerous organs, and provide a genetic tool to evaluate important functional properties of epithelial-specific splice variants in vivo."

Mice with ablation of Epithelial splicing regulatory protein (Esrp1) develop cleft lip and palate. Loss of both Esrp1 and its paralog Esrp2 results in widespread developmental defects with broad implications to human disease. Deletion of the Esrps in the epidermis revealed their requirement for establishing a proper skin barrier, a primary function of epithelial cells comprising the epidermis. We profiled the global Esrp-mediated splicing regulatory program in epidermis, which revealed large-scale programs of epithelial cell-type-specific splicing required for epithelial cell functions. These mice represent a valuable model for evaluating the essential role for AS in development and function of epithelial cells, which play essential roles in tissue homeostasis in numerous organs, and provide a genetic tool to evaluate important functional properties of epithelial-specific splice variants in vivo."

The result of AS is the proteomic expansion of an otherwise limited genome. Switches in mRNA isoforms due to AS often result in protein isoforms with distinct functions essential for normal development, and dysregulated splicing of these events can lead to disease (<a href=\"#bib35\">Moroy and Heyd, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Singh and Cooper, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kelemen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cieply and Carstens, 2015</a>). Indeed, over 95% of multi-exon genes in humans are alternatively spliced and AS has been shown to have essential functions across vertebrate and invertebrate lineages (<a href=\"#bib16\">Graveley, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). AS is regulated by a balance of positive and negatively acting RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that can alter the recruitment of the spliceosome, the macromolecular RNA-protein complex required for splicing, to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites in a pre-mRNA. Regulatory splicing factors are accessory RBPs which are often not components of the spliceosome, but that associate with a subset of transcripts via interactions with cognate RNA binding sites within exons and introns of the pre-mRNA. In many cases the position of the regulatory splicing factors relative to one another and to the alternatively spliced exon determine whether they promote splicing or skipping of a given exon (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fu and Ares, 2014</a>). In addition to the accessory RNA splicing factors, core spliceosomal proteins can also modulate the efficiency of exon recognition and in turn modify AS (<a href=\"#bib41\">Park et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Saltzman et al., 2011</a>)."

However, a growing number of cell- and tissue-type-specific splicing factors have been identified, which regulate global splicing regulatory networks (SRNs) that converge on functionally coherent biological pathways required for the cell or tissue in which they are expressed (<a href=\"#bib62\">Ule et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kalsotra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Warzecha et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gehman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Licatalosi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Quesnel-Vallieres et al., 2015</a>). Transcripts that are alternatively spliced as part of tissue- or cell-type specific SRNs do not significantly overlap with transcriptional gene expression programs in the same tissues or cells, indicating that AS and transcriptional regulation are largely independent processes utilized to diversify the transcriptomes that distinguish different cell types (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pan et al., 2008</a>). This observation thus highlights the function of AS as an added layer of gene expression regulation, as well as the potential role of AS in fine tuning the functions of proteins in biological pathways relevant to different cell types. Tissue- or cell-type-specific regulatory splicing factors and the programs of AS under their control are often required during normal development, which has been most extensively characterized in brain, muscle, and cardiac tissue (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kalsotra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gehman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Licatalosi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Quesnel-Vallieres et al., 2015</a>). The bulk of tissue-specific splicing factors have been identified in these organ systems, and in turn the requirement of tissue specific AS in cardiac, neural, and muscle development has been further characterized in mouse models. The loss of regulatory splicing factors in these tissues often result in defects in fetal to adult splicing transitions, tissue patterning defects, and organ dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib30\">Licatalosi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). Tissue and/or cell-type-specific networks of AS contribute to the posttranscriptional landscape of a tissue or cell type, generating splicing isoforms that provide specific functions in the tissue or cell in which they are generated (<a href=\"#bib6\">Castle et al., 2008</a>). It is important to recognize that most human and mouse tissues and organs are comprised of numerous distinct cell types. These cell types within tissues include endothelial, epithelial, and fibroblast cells that express common splicing patterns independent of the tissue of origin (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mallinjoud et al., 2014</a>). This further emphasizes the role of cell type- or tissue-specific AS outside of the nervous system, muscle, and cardiac tissues as well as within defined cell types. As such there remain many gaps in our understanding of distinct cell type-specific programs of AS that differ both between and within different tissues."

One example of a cell-type-specific splicing event that is essential for normal development is AS of the <i>Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (Fgfr2)</i> pre-mRNA, where there is distinct expression of the <i>Fgfr2-IIIb</i> or <i>Fgfr2-IIIc</i> isoform in epithelial and mesenchymal cells, respectively (<a href=\"#bib38\">Orr-Urtreger et al., 1993</a>). The mutually exclusive AS of exons IIIb and IIIc alters the second half of the Immunoglobulin-like III (Ig3) domain of the receptor extracellular ligand binding domain, and in turn alters the binding specificity of the Fgfr2 receptor to its cognate Fgf ligands (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>). The exquisite cell-type-specific expression of the Fgfr2-IIIb and Fgfr2-IIIc isoforms underlies reciprocal communication between epithelium and neighboring mesenchyme, wherein the ability of the epithelial Fgfr2-IIIb receptor to respond to mesenchymally expressed Fgfs, and vice versa, has proven essential for the development of multiple organs and appendages during embryogenesis. Knockout (KO) of <i>Fgfr2-IIIb</i> or one of its primary ligands, Fgf10, in mouse results in developmental defects in limb, lung, craniofacial and palate formation, salivary gland, tooth, and epidermal appendage (hair) formation (<a href=\"#bib71\">Xu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">De Moerlooze et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ohuchi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Revest et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Petiot et al., 2003</a>). This highlights the crucial function of this signaling axis in normal patterning during development in a wide range of cells and tissues. Moreover, the AS of <i>Fgfr2-IIIb/c</i> has also been shown to dynamically change during the cellular transformation process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a necessary developmental process for embryo and tissue morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib52\">Savagner et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Thiery et al., 2009</a>)."

Using a genome-wide high-throughput cDNA screen we identified the epithelial splicing regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (Esrp1 and Esrp2) as essential regulators of <i>Fgfr2</i> splicing (<a href=\"#bib67\">Warzecha et al., 2009a</a>). The expression of the ESRPs (ESRP1 and ESRP2) is epithelial cell type-specific and knockdown of ESRP1 and ESRP2 in epithelial cells induces a complete switch from <i>Fgfr2-IIIb</i> to <i>Fgfr2-IIIc</i> isoforms. Conversely, ectopic expression of Esrp1 in mesenchymal cells induces a switch from <i>Fgfr2-IIIc</i> to <i>Fgfr2-IIIb</i>, indicating that the ESRPs are necessary and sufficient to enforce expression of the epithelial <i>Fgfr2-IIIb</i> isoform (<a href=\"#bib67\">Warzecha et al., 2009a</a>). Using splicing sensitive microarrays and high throughput sequencing (RNA-seq), we previously used cell lines to demonstrate that the ESRPs control a genome-wide program of AS (<a href=\"#bib68\">Warzecha et al., 2009b</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dittmar et al., 2012</a>). Importantly, ESRP targets are enriched for genes involved in epithelial cell properties such as cytoskeletal dynamics, cell motility, cell\u2013cell junctions, and pathways involved in EMT. These observations strongly suggested that genome-wide programs of ESRP regulated splicing coordinate biological functions necessary for normal development and epithelial cell function (<a href=\"#bib68\">Warzecha et al., 2009b</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dittmar et al., 2012</a>)."

The ESRP mouse homologues, <i>Esrp1</i> and <i>Esrp2</i>, are specifically expressed in epithelial cells in numerous organs in adult mice and are essentially absent in mesenchymal cells and other non-epithelial cell types (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For example, our previous RNA in situ RNA analysis for <i>Esrp1</i> and similar in situ analysis for <i>Esrp2</i> presented here document expression of both mRNAs in all epithelial cell layers that comprise the epidermis as well as epithelial cells of the lung, large and small intestine, salivary glands, bladder, kidney, and other prototypical epithelial cell layers (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>, also see Figures S5\u2013S8 in <a href=\"#bib67\">Warzecha et al. (2009a)</a>). Furthermore, in situ analysis of <i>Esrp1</i> expression during mouse embryogenesis demonstrated specific <i>Esrp1</i> expression in definitive endoderm and surface ectoderm as well as epithelial cells derived from these germ layers (<a href=\"#bib49\">Revil and Jerome-Majewska, 2013</a>). Comprehensive microarray analysis in mouse tissues and cells has also documented the expression of both <i>Esrp1</i> and <i>Esrp2</i> in distinct tissues and cell types (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Su et al., 2002</a>). To address the functional requirement of the Esrps in development we generated <i>Esrp1</i> and <i>Esrp2</i> KO mice. Whereas <i>Esrp2</i> null mice are viable and fertile, we demonstrate that KO of <i>Esrp1</i> alone is neonatal lethal at Postnatal Day (P) 0, associated with fully penetrant bilateral cleft lip and palate (CL/P). <i>Esrp1</i> KO combined with loss of <i>Esrp2</i> resulted in more pronounced defects in organogenesis that will be described herein. For the first in vivo evaluation of a global Esrp-regulated AS program we utilized total epidermis for RNA-seq. The loss of Esrps in epidermis is also associated with global changes in gene expression indicative of an epithelial barrier defect. We confirmed this skin barrier defect using conditional KO of the <i>Esrps</i> in epidermis. The <i>Esrp</i> KO mice reveal the essential role of the Esrps in maintaining an epithelial cell-specific splicing program for normal development during mouse embryogenesis, underscoring the role of AS in the development of a multitude of organs and appendages, and the requirement of the Esrps in critical epithelial cell functions."

Excision of exons 7\u20139 following Cre-mediated recombination removes the first RNA Recognition Motif (RRM), and places the remaining transcript out of frame, generating a null allele of <i>Esrp1</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). Since we did not anticipate that <i>Esrp2</i> KO alone would yield a phenotype we obtained an <i>Esrp2</i> KO mouse ES cell line from the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>)."

From the crosses we generated nine allelic combinations, including all combinations of <i>Esrp1</i> and <i>Esrp2</i> WT and KO alleles. We confirmed the expected Mendelian transmission rates of the <i>Esrp1</i> and <i>Esrp2</i> KO alleles in these crosses, indicating there was no early embryonic lethality associated with loss of the Esrps. As we predicted, <i>Esrp2</i> null mice were viable and fertile without any detectable abnormalities. In contrast, mice with germline KO of <i>Esrp1</i> exhibited fully penetrant bilateral cleft lip and cleft palate (CL/P), and these mice are neonatal lethal on post natal day 0 (P0) most likely due to orofacial clefting. Therefore, while Esrp2 is not essential in mice with intact <i>Esrp1</i> alleles, Esrp1 is necessary for craniofacial development and post-natal viability."

We harvested E18.5 embryos from all nine genetic combinations. Overall embryo metrics including weight and crown to rump length showed KO embryos were normal in size, KH embryos were only slightly reduced in weight and length compared to WT littermate embryos, whereas DKO embryos showed a \u223c30% reduction in length (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D,E</a>). To characterize the CL/P phenotype we evaluated the gross morphology of post-fixed E18.5 embryo heads. Esrp1 KO embryos exhibited bilateral cleft lip and clefting of the primary and secondary hard palate, as well as the soft palate (n &gt; 40 embryos evaluated). This phenotype was also observed in KH and DKO embryos, but these embryos also exhibited more pronounced craniofacial defects including profound rostral shortening, and mandibular hypoplasia and dysplasia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013L</a>). We performed Alizarin Red and Alcian Blue bone and cartilage stains to evaluate the skeletal defects associated with the CL/P phenotype. These stains further defined the rostral shortening defect and mandibular defects in the Esrp deficient embryos. DKO mice presented with the most severe defects, resulting in a malformed mandible lacking the normal curvature seen in control embryos (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1M\u2013P,U\u2013X</a>). Closer inspection of the ventral aspect of cranial bone stains revealed absence of the premaxillary bones and palatal bone hypoplasia, consistent with CL/P (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Q\u2013T</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>, dorsal aspect). The mandibles of Esrp KO embryos lacked the coronoid process (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1U\u2013X</a>), which explains the widened oral opening in the Esrp deficient mice. These results support a requirement for Esrp1 in normal craniofacial patterning and development. These studies also demonstrate that Esrp2 can partially compensate for loss of Esrp1, as craniofacial phenotypes observed in <i>Esrp1</i> KO mice are more profound in combination with deletion of one or both alleles of <i>Esrp2</i>."

Whereas we observed no gross forelimb or hindlimb defects in <i>Esrp1</i> KO mice, Esrp KH embryos often presented with malformed forelimbs and forepaw syndactyly (n = 22 evaluated). In DKO E18.5 embryos the forelimbs were further malformed, associated with smaller limbs and full fusion of the forepaw, or partially penetrant forelimb agenesis (\u223c33%, n = 9/27 evaluated). Bone and cartilage stains revealed the forelimb defect was associated with the absence of the radius and humerus bones (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B,C</a>). The forelimb defects thus also represent an example where <i>Esrp2</i> can partially compensate for <i>Esrp1</i> ablation, and that <i>Esrp2</i> can modify the phenotype in a dose dependent manner. The variable penetrance seen in the DKO forelimbs, in which forelimb agenesis or profound limb malformation were seen, further underscores the crucial function of Esrps in limb development. While the mechanisms that give rise to these abnormalities require further study, <i>Esrp1</i> and <i>Esrp2</i> are expressed in the ectoderm overlying mesenchyme of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and crosstalk between these cells, including a role of Fgfr2-IIIb in ectoderm, have been shown to underlie limb development (<a href=\"#bib71\">Xu et al., 1998</a>). However, hindlimbs were unaffected in Esrp KO mice and therefore the molecular cues driving formation of forelimb and hindlimbs clearly differ with respect to a requirement for Esrp regulated splicing."

Previous work that evaluated the developmental requirement for exon IIIb in mice used a mouse allele in which exon IIIb was deleted. The removal of exon IIIb in the mature transcript results in mice with a multitude of developmental defects in a variety of organ systems during embryonic development including lung, thymus, salivary gland, and kidney (<a href=\"#bib9\">De Moerlooze et al., 2000</a>). To determine if the loss of the Esrp proteins impacted development of many of these organs, we collected whole embryo sagittal sections from Esrp1 KO and DKO embryos and littermate controls at E15.5. We observed agenesis of two organs that undergo branching morphogenesis, lung and salivary gland, in the DKO embryos (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The failure to form lung and salivary glands in DKO embryos represents examples of organ development that require the Esrp proteins, but where partial compensation for <i>Esrp1</i> ablation by a single copy of <i>Esrp2</i> is sufficient for these organs to form. This implicates the Esrps in regulating branching morphogenesis in vivo, but not all organs utilizing this developmental program are absent in Esrp DKO mice. Kidneys, which undergo a stereotypical branching morphogenesis, are present in the KO and DKO embryos, albeit reduced in size. This level of histological analysis cannot rule out potential subtle defects in branching morphogenesis that may impact organ size in the kidney. Further detailed analysis of these phenotypes will be needed to evaluate the developmental timing and levels of branching defects in Esrp deficient mice."

The skin forms an essential barrier that protects the body from environmental stresses and hazards, maintains fluid electrolyte homeostasis, and provides a thermoregulatory layer. We therefore focused further histologic and molecular analysis on KO and DKO skin. We harvested E18.5 dorsal skin and performed H&amp;E; staining of dorsal midline sagittal sections. Skin isolated from KO and KH embryos did not reveal any major defects in skin formation or appendages (i.e.,: hair follicles). However, DKO embryos had thin transparent skin at E18.5. Histological analysis of DKO and control littermates revealed epidermal hypoplasia (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Quantification of epidermal thickness, as measured from the basal keratinocyte layer to the granular layer, in DKO skin was reduced by 35% compared to littermate controls carrying at least one wild type copy of <i>Esrp1</i> (Control: 25.79 \u00b1 2.20 \u03bcm, n = 8, DKO: 16.68 \u00b1 1.66 \u03bcm, n = 6, unpaired two-tailed t test p &lt; 0.0001) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In addition to epidermal hypoplasia, DKO skin at the histological level appeared to have reduced hair follicle number. To address this we counted hair follicle numbers over 9 fields of view along the length of the skin. In DKO skin there were \u223c23% fewer hair follicles (Control: 16.00 \u00b1 2.37, n = 8, DKO: 12.25 \u00b1 1.24, n = 6, unpaired two-tailed t test p = 0.0043) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Moreover, the reduced number of hair follicles in DKO skin was associated with earlier staged hair follicles compared to controls, indicating delayed hair follicle maturation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Paus et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Petiot et al., 2003</a>)."

Mouse epidermis is comprised of interfollicular epidermis, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands. Basal keratinocytes reside in the deepest layer of the epidermis adjacent to the underlying dermis and are arranged in a single cell layer, both within the interfollicular epidermis and hair follicles. The source of stem cells needed for vertical proliferation and differentiation for stratification of the epidermis reside within the basal keratinocyte layer. These stem cells give rise to transit amplifying cells that vertically proliferate and differentiate into the other stratified epidermal layers (spinous layer, granular layer, and stratum corneum) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fuchs, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Solanas and Benitah, 2013</a>). To evaluate the differentiation program in our <i>Esrp</i> DKO mice we performed indirect fluorescent immunohistochemistry for epidermal differentiation markers. We used markers of basal keratinocytes (Keratin 14, p63), spinous layer (Keratin 10), granular layer (Loricrin, Filaggrin), and hair follicles (\u03b2-catenin, Lef-1) in E18.5 skin sections (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). DKO skin sections stained positively for these differentiation markers; however, Keratin 14, Keratin 10, Loricrin, and Filaggrin expression domains were reduced in overall size compared to the control skin samples (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is consistent with the observed epidermal hypoplasia, and illustrates that DKO epidermis nonetheless is still capable of forming a stratified epidermis. Where hair follicles were present, we observed cortical cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin in the epithelial cells of the hair follicle. Nuclear expression of \u03b2-catenin was observed in cells bordering the dermal cells, which expressed nuclear Lef-1, a \u03b2-catenin transcriptional target. Thus, hair formation was also functionally intact, although overall follicle number was reduced in DKO skin. We also noted that p63 staining reveals a less organized basal keratinocyte layer, with disorganized and sporadically spaced p63 negative cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These skin phenotypes are similar to those previously observed in Fgfr2-IIIb isoform-specific KO mice that also showed epidermal hypoplasia and reduced and immature hair follicle numbers (<a href=\"#bib44\">Petiot et al., 2003</a>)."

However, in DKO epidermis <i>Fgfr2</i> underwent a full switch from <i>Fgfr2-IIIb</i> (epithelial) to <i>Fgfr2-IIIc</i> (mesenchymal), indicating that the production of the Fgfr2-IIIb isoform is fully dependent upon the Esrps in epidermis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

                                "text": "Each KO group was compared to the WT group to identify differentially spliced events with an associated change in Percent Spliced In (PSI, \u0394PSI or \u0394\u03c8) of these events. The detected AS events from the four genetic groups were clustered for each comparison and a heat map was used to represent \u0394PSI in the three comparisons of the different KO conditions relative to WT controls. As expected, the largest number and greatest \u0394PSI in detected splicing switches were seen in the DKO epidermis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The splicing events for the five major classes of AS were cataloged: Skipped Exon (SE, cassette exons), Alternative 5\u2032 splice site (A5SS), Alternative 3\u2032 splice site (A3SS), MXE, and Retained Introns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The majority of AS events were identified in the SE category and comprise 55\u201372% of the total detected Esrp-dependent AS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The Venn diagram depicting the overlap between the KO, KH, and DKO groups further highlights the growing number of SE events detected when one or both alleles of <i>Esrp2</i> are ablated in addition to <i>Esrp1</i>. We did note 48 events detected in the KO and/or KH analysis that were not identified by rMATS in the DKO samples. We suspect that some of these arise due to statistical limitations in RNA-seq based detection of AS events in addition to the higher numbers of mapped reads from the KO samples. To evaluate this further, we also noted that 14 of these 48 events arose from the 10 tandem variable exons of Cd44. The variable inclusion of these exons in the KO and KH epidermis compared to the almost full skipping of all 10 exons (Cd44s) in the DKO is a primary source of the detected non-overlapping SE events (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is also possible that some of these events are false positives or that differences in RNA sample quality or that of the libraries account for the lack of detection of some of these events in DKO samples. While the SE category represents the largest group of splicing events, there were several key splicing events identified in the MXE category as well as complex splicing patterns harder to categorize in a single group. For example, <i>Fgfr1</i>, <i>Fgfr2</i>, and <i>Fgfr3</i> were found within the top statistically significant events for the MXE category from the WT vs DKO comparison. Custom genome browser views of these three MXE events confirm the splicing patterns as determined by RT-PCR for the <i>Fgfr(s)</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <i>Cd44</i> AS, mentioned previously, represents a complex conserved splicing event in which inclusion of 10 exons in the mouse variable region of the <i>Cd44</i> transcript is associated with the epithelial isoforms (<i>Cd44v</i>), and the exclusion of these exons generates the mesenchymal <i>Cd44s</i> isoform (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brown et al., 2011</a>). The Esrps were shown to be primary regulators of the CD44v isoform, where ESRP depletion led to a nearly complete switch towards the mesenchymal CD44s isoform in human cell lines (<a href=\"#bib67\">Warzecha et al., 2009a</a>). AS of many of these variable exons were detected in the SE category and were confirmed in the custom genome browser and by RT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We extended our analysis of variable splicing sensitivity to six additional previously known Esrp targets in WT, KO, KH, and DKO epidermis. From this expanded list of Esrp targets we observed three classes of splicing events: a full change in splicing with <i>Esrp1</i> KO with no additional splicing change in KH or DKO samples (<i>Map3k7</i>), a gradual splicing switch seen from <i>Esrp1</i> KO to KH to DKO (<i>Numb</i>, <i>Nf2</i>, and <i>Scrib</i>), or changes in splicing only observed in the DKO (<i>Itga6</i> and <i>Macf1</i>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

In total we have tested 38 splicing events including the events described above (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>). Of the targets evaluated with successful RT-PCRs all exhibited the expected splicing pattern as predicted by rMATS (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

These examples thus further indicate that there are some false negatives in the RNA-Seq analysis of DKO epidermis.

However, splicing factors may also indirectly induce changes in splicing patterns by a number of mechanisms, including changes in splicing that alter the expression level, activity, or localization of other splicing factors. To investigate the possibility that differential expression of other splicing factors in Esrp depleted epidermis might be involved in the observed regulation, we focused on a set of 188 mouse orthologues of human RBPs as well as other genes with known or putative roles in splicing regulation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Han et al., 2013</a>). Since the number and the degree of splicing change were largest in Esrp DKO epidermis we analyzed differential expression of splicing factors in WT and DKO skin. We noted large changes in <i>Esrp1</i> and <i>Esrp2</i> expression in DKO epidermis, but there were some more modest changes in expression of other candidate splicing factors with statistically significant changes in expression following Esrp ablation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Hence, while a loss of Esrp expression is likely to play a major role in splicing of numerous transcripts, alterations in expression of some of these other candidate regulators may also contribute to splicing shifts in some targets. It is noteworthy that although <i>Esrp1</i> RNA levels are not completely absent in the <i>Esrp1</i> KO RNA-seq samples by FPKM, mapped reads from the RNA-seq data confirmed that these RNAs represent transcripts splicing across the exon 7\u20139 deletion from exon 6 to exon 10, which would not encode a functional Esrp1 protein and reduced transcript levels are indicative of targeting by NMD. We confirmed the loss of <i>Esrp1</i> expression by qRT-PCR targeting the exon 7\u20139 deletion in Esrp KO samples by western for Esrp1 in total epidermis as well as histologically in skin sections using in situ hybridization for <i>Esrp1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

The motif enrichment of known splicing factor binding sites consisted of a set of binding sites for 115 RBPs collected from the literature (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). For each of the motifs we looked for their enrichment in the regulated exon and 250 bp of flanking sequence in the upstream and downstream intronic sequence of SE events (\u0394PSI \u2265 0.05, FDR &lt; 0.05), excluding the splice sites, and compared the motif enrichment to a background set of non-regulated splicing events (min PSI &gt; 0.15, max PSI &lt; 0.85, FDR &gt; 50%, FPKM &gt; 5.0) from the rMATS analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). For this analysis we collected all significant SE events and divided them into Esrp enhanced (high PSI in WT) or silenced (high PSI in KO) from each of the pairwise comparisons of WT vs KO, KH, or DKO epidermis. Motif enrichment analysis of known splicing factor binding sites identified the top ranked Esrp1 (UGGUGG) binding site motif defined by SELEX in the upstream intron of Esrp silenced SE events in all three pairwise comparisons, and the Esrp1 motif was also enriched in the exon body of Esrp1 KO splicing targets (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dittmar et al., 2012</a>). We also observed enrichment of the Esrp1 motif in the downstream intron of Esrp enhanced exons in the KO and DKO analysis. This is consistent with the Esrp RNA binding map identified from our in vitro Esrp targets, wherein Esrp binding in the upstream intron or in the exon body of a regulated SE events mediates exon skipping, and conversely binding in the downstream intron promotes exon inclusion (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dittmar et al., 2012</a>). We also identified motifs for SFPQ, RBM38, RBM24, PTB, SRSF10, MBNL1, BRUNOL6, and QKI in this analysis. The enrichment of these motifs suggests potential co-regulation of AS in some of these regulated events by these splicing factors."

Using all possible 6-mers we confirmed the presence of the Esrp1 UGGUGG motif as described above, but we also observed a growing list of GU-rich sequences including the GGUGGU, GUGGUG, and other UGG-containing motifs identified by SELEX-Seq (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 3</a>). We also determined an Esrp RNA binding map for Esrp regulated SE splicing events using the top 12 Esrp1 binding sites identified by SELEX-Seq. We mapped the enrichment of these motifs in the exon body and in 250 bp intronic sequences flanking the regulated exon and up- and downstream exons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). There was a strong enrichment for these Esrp motifs (red line) in the upstream intron of silenced exons in all three comparisons, and enrichment in the exon body of silenced exons with the strongest enrichment in the <i>Esrp1</i> KO sensitive exons. Moreover, there was also enrichment of the Esrp motifs in the downstream introns of Esrp enhanced exons (blue line), with the most striking enrichment in the KO. We cannot rule out the possibility that other changes in splicing factors at the level of AS, localization, or translational efficiency may affect their activity independent of changes in total RNA expression, and in turn alter the regulatory landscape of Esrp responsive splicing events. However, the differential expression of the Esrps together with the enrichment of Esrp binding motifs and their positional enrichment relative to the regulated exons further suggest that many or most of the identified splicing events are likely direct targets."

We performed differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis on all RNA-seq data generated from the four genetic groups. We identified 572 significant changes in gene expression, with &gt;twofold difference in gene expression and FDR &lt; 5% based on average FPKM in at least one pairwise comparison of the four genetic groupings (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). The differential gene expression analysis revealed that by far the most predominant changes in expression are observed between WT and DKO embryonic epidermis. This observation is consistent with the emergence of an epidermal phenotype only in the DKO epidermis. In the WT vs DKO group there were 514 significant changes in gene expression, of which 65% (337/514) were down regulated and 35% (178/514) were up regulated in the DKO epidermis. To identify biological functions of these gene expression changes we utilized GO analysis, using DAVID 6.7, on both the up and down regulated genes from the DKO epidermis. The DEGs were enriched for the GO terms \u2018epidermal cell differentiation\u2019, \u2018keratinocyte differentiation\u2019, \u2018oxidation reduction\u2019, and \u2018fatty acid metabolic process\u2019 (FDR [Benjamini-Hochberg] &lt;0.05) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 2</a>).

Reduced expression of <i>Grhl1</i>, <i>Krt77</i>, and <i>Skint4</i> was also confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (8/11 of tested genes, 73% validation) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Up regulation of EDC genes as well as changes in other genes are often associated with mouse models harboring skin barrier defects, such as <i>Loricrin</i>, <i>Klf4</i>, and <i>Grhl3</i> KO mouse models (<a href=\"#bib54\">Segre et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Koch et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Yu et al., 2006</a>). While the mechanism of up regulating EDC gene expression is not well understood, it is believed to be a compensatory response to stress or breakdown of the skin barrier function. Because very similar changes in gene expression are observed in <i>Esrp1/Esrp2</i> DKO epidermis as those in other mouse KO models associated with barrier defects, we believe these changes in EDC genes and <i>Keratins</i> are mostly an indirect effect of the Esrp KO, in contrast to the direct regulation of <i>Grhl1</i> by AS-NMD. However, it is possible that some of the changes in gene expression may be due to direct regulation by the Esrps at other post-transcriptional steps, such as mRNA stability or translation. These collective changes in gene expression suggest epithelial barrier dysfunction in the epidermis associated with the loss of the Esrps."

However, as the <i>Esrp1/Esrp2</i> DKO mice are not viable at birth we were unable to analyze postnatal barrier defects in DKO mice. Therefore, we utilized a conditional KO approach using transgenic <i>Keratin14-Cre</i> (<i>Krt14-Cre</i>) mice (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andl et al., 2004</a>). This <i>Krt14-Cre</i> transgene is first expressed at E11.5 in surface epithelium and maintains expression in basal layer keratinocytes of stratified epidermis (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Because basal keratinocytes undergo differentiation to give rise to all epithelial cells of the interfollicular epidermis, Krt14-Cre effectively induces KO in all epithelial cell layers of stratified epidermis. We generated control mice harboring at least one WT <i>Esrp1</i> allele (<i>Esrp1</i><sup><i>flox/+</i></sup><i>, Esrp2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>, Krt14-Cre Tg\u2212 or Tg+</i>) and littermate Krt14-DKO (<i>Esrp1</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup><i>, Esrp2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>, Krt14-Cre Tg+</i>) mice. Krt14-DKO neonates were viable at birth (P0.5), however no Krt14-DKO pups with confirmed <i>Esrp1</i> KO survived to the following day (P1.5). While the early neonatal lethality in the Krt14-DKO mice precluded long term evaluation of barrier function, we were able to evaluate skin barrier function by means of a standard water loss assay, which measures the ability of a neonatal mouse epidermis to retain fluid and prevent dehydration by loss of water through the skin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gladden et al., 2010</a>). Litters of conditional KO neonates were isolated from their mother at P0, and weighed every 30 min for 5 hr. During the time-course control littermates lost weight at expected levels, but never exceeded \u223c1.5% of total body weight, indicative of an intact epidermal barrier. However, Krt14-DKO pups lost significantly more weight (\u223c2.5\u20133% of total body weight) compared to littermate controls during the same time period (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). The <i>Krt14-Cre</i> DKO mice that exhibited weight loss during the water loss assay also displayed skin phenotypes observed in other mouse KO models associated with skin barrier defects: thin red shinny skin with areas of dry flaky skin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Koch et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gladden et al., 2010</a>)."

To determine if the Krt14-DKO also presented with the molecular signature for barrier defect observed in the DKO epidermis, we performed qRT-PCR for the EDC genes and <i>Keratins</i> tested in the DKO epidermis.

Therefore, the Krt14-DKO mice share the differential expression of EDC and <i>Keratin</i> genes, consistent with the observed skin barrier defect. Taken together these observations implicate the Esrps in the regulation of skin barrier function, a fundamental characteristic of epithelial cells in the epidermis. However, the maintenance of barrier function across epithelial cell layers is a fundamental property of epithelia in many organs throughout the body. Therefore, the Esrp-directed splicing network generates epithelial specific or enriched protein isoforms that are likely to be required for epithelial cell barrier function in epithelial cells throughout mammalian organisms."

The numerous developmental defects we identified in these mice demonstrate an essential role for Esrp-regulated splicing in the development of many organ systems. Using germline KOs for <i>Esrp1</i> and <i>Esrp2</i> we demonstrate a requirement for Esrp1 during embryonic development and postnatal survival, with loss of both proteins manifesting the most severe phenotypes. To evaluate Esrp regulated splicing in the context of the development of a specific tissue we used the readily accessible epidermis as our model system. We uncovered variable sensitivity of AS events to loss of Esrp1 alone or in combination with loss of Esrp2, which were also enriched for Esrp binding motifs. Global changes in gene expression accompanying loss of the Esrps in the skin of the germline DKO mice revealed an epidermal barrier defect that was confirmed using conditional ablation of the Esrps in the epithelial cells that constitute the epidermis. Together, these observations provide strong evidence for the cell autonomous requirement of the Esrps in epidermal development and programs of epithelial-specific splicing in organogenesis and epithelial cell function."

The primary and most readily apparent defect in mice with ablation of <i>Esrp1</i> alone was fully penetrant bilateral cleft lip and palate (CL/P). Orofacial defects are amongst the most common forms of birth defects but the causes of CL/P are heterogeneous, including syndromic and non-syndromic genetic disorders and environmental factors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dixon et al., 2011</a>). Importantly, whereas there are greater numbers of patients that have cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) compared to isolated cleft palate (Cleft Palate Only [CPO]), there are few mouse models for CL/P compared to CPO. The limited mouse models for CL/P include KO models for genes regulating signaling and transcription (<a href=\"#bib21\">Juriloff and Harris, 2008</a>). Therefore, the Esrp KO mouse is a unique model that can be used to further evaluate the role of epithelial-specific splicing regulation in lip and palate formation. Based on previous evidence that cell or tissue-specific splicing factors regulate biologically coherent sets of targets genes in the cells that express them, further determination of epithelial specific splice variants could provide molecular insights into novel genes underlying the pathogenesis of CL/P. The orofacial defects were more severe in mice with combined loss of Esrp2. Similarly, mice deficient for Esrp1 and Esrp2 exhibit progressively more severe phenotypes in other organs and tissues, including forelimb, salivary gland, lung, and skin. The functional redundancy of the Esrps during development is consistent with our in vitro observations at the level of AS. Therefore, the progression of phenotypes could be due to the degree of change in AS mediated by loss of Esrp1 alone or in combination with Esrp2."

                        "text": "To evaluate the potential for Esrp1 and Esrp2 co-regulation of AS, we used the epidermis as our model system to identify the global Esrp regulated splicing program in vivo. We illustrated the possible biological impact of varied sensitivity of Esrp targets by highlighting the splicing of exons <i>-IIIb</i> and <i>-IIIc</i> in the <i>Fgfr</i> family of receptors. This splicing event regulates ligand binding specificity and the Fgf signaling axis is a crucial signaling pathway utilized during development in a multitude of organ systems. It is of note that despite the fact that the Esrps are required for expression of Fgfr2-IIIb, <i>Esrp</i> DKO embryos do not fully phenocopy the defects previously seen in <i>Fgfr2-IIIb</i> KO mice. This is most evident in the craniofacial and limb defects, where KO of <i>Esrp1</i> alone results in bilateral cleft lip and palate and DKO embryos have forelimb defects, whereas <i>Fgfr2-IIIb</i> KO mice exhibit CPO and absence of both forelimbs and hindlimbs (<a href=\"#bib9\">De Moerlooze et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rice et al., 2004</a>). Part of this discrepancy can likely be accounted for by differences in the manner in which <i>Fgfr2</i> splicing is altered in each model. In our mice, there is a switch in splicing from exon IIIb to IIIc in <i>Esrp</i> DKO mice that would still encode a functional receptor, albeit one with altered ligand binding specificities. In contrast, the deletion of exon IIIb in <i>Fgfr2-IIIb</i> KO mice does not result in default splicing to exon IIIc in epithelial cells, but instead results primarily in skipping of both exons IIIb and IIIc, thereby inactivating <i>Fgfr2</i> expression altogether in epithelial cells, but retaining Fgfr2-IIIc in mesenchymal cells. Hence in some contexts, autocrine or paracrine functions of Fgf ligands for Fgfr2-IIIc may compensate for the switch in <i>Fgfr2</i> splicing, but not in others. For example, ablation of Fgfr2-IIIb and its mesenchymal derived ligand Fgf10, result in failure to form lungs and submandibular (salivary) glands, indicating that the switch in Fgfr2 isoforms in <i>Esrp</i> DKO mice may be sufficient to phenocopy these defects, but not others. However, it must also be emphasized that Esrp ablation also induces global changes in AS that surely contribute to the phenotypes we observe, including those, such as cleft lip, that were not identified in Fgfr2-IIIb KO mice. In the epidermis, we suspect that alterations in Fgf receptor splicing and Fgf signaling contribute to the phenotypes we observed since epidermal hypoplasia was observed in both Fgfr2-IIIb and <i>Esrp1/Esrp2</i> DKO skin. However, conditional KO of Fgfr2-IIIb as well as combined KO of Fgfr2 and Fgfr1-IIIb in the epidermis is not lethal unlike the post-natal lethality we observe when <i>Esrp1</i> and <i>Esrp2</i> are conditionally ablated in epidermis. While skin from mice with epidermal-specific ablation of <i>Fgfr2-IIIb</i> or <i>Fgfr2/Fgfr1-IIIb</i> exhibits some inflammation and/or a later onset barrier defect in adult skin, these mice survive for at least several months post-natally. These observations, combined with the fact that <i>Esrp1/Esrp2</i> ablation in the epidermis is associated with an isoform switch rather than complete loss of function of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 receptor proteins, strongly suggest that splicing changes in additional Esrp target transcripts are required for the lethal barrier defect we observe. Therefore, the challenge for future studies will be to identify the individual or combined splicing events that underlie the observed phenotypes in the skin as well as other tissues and organs."

These changes would lead to an altered proteomic landscape by the loss or introduction of different protein isoforms. For example, <i>Fgfr2</i> undergoes a full switch from <i>-IIIb</i> to <i>-IIIc</i>, thus entirely swapping one isoform for its alternative isoform. We also observed cases where the loss of the Esrps resulted in the loss of an isoform or the inverse where a new isoform was introduced (e.g.,: Fgfrs, Enah, Arhgef11, Itga6, Macf1, Nf2, etc). These changes in protein isoforms likely underlie the observed phenotypes in the Esrp deficient mice. The variable sensitivity of AS events to the loss of Esrp1 vs combined loss of Esrp1 and Esrp2 was not restricted to a handful of Esrp targets, but rather was observed in the global splicing analysis in the epidermis. The fact that Esrp2 can only partially compensate for loss of Esrp1 in the epidermis, despite retaining high expression in Esrp1 KO mice, indicates that this differential sensitivity partly reflects reduced splicing activity of Esrp2 compared to Esrp1. It is important to emphasize that the levels of both <i>Esrp1</i> and <i>Esrp2</i> expression are high in the epidermis (Average FPKM: Esrp1 130, Esrp2 127), which in turn could impart greater functional redundancy in the epidermis. However, not all epithelial cells express <i>Esrp1</i> or <i>Esrp2</i> as highly as in the skin and most epithelial cells express less <i>Esrp2</i> relative to <i>Esrp1</i> (<a href=\"#bib58\">Su et al., 2002</a>). The differences in phenotypes observed in the <i>Esrp1</i> KO and <i>Esrp1/Esrp2</i> DKO may therefore reflect splicing alteration in specific transcripts for which Esrp2 cannot fully compensate for loss of Esrp1 and/or be reflective of differences in Esrp2 levels in different epithelia."

The SE events identified from the KO epidermis were enriched for Esrp binding motifs in the upstream intron and exon body of silenced exons, and within the downstream intron of enhanced exons proximal to the 5\u2032 splice site. This RNA binding map is consistent with strong repression and enhancement, respectively. This motif enrichment pattern is most strikingly observed in the KO dataset, as the exon body enrichment is reduced/lost in the KH and DKO samples. This describes a potential mechanism in which the <i>Esrp1</i> KO sensitive AS events require more Esrp binding sites for maintenance of the Esrp-directed splicing pattern. In the absence of Esrp1 expression, Esrp2 is not sufficient to drive AS regulation or to block the activity of other splicing factors that promote the opposite pattern of splicing. Despite the absence of major changes in gene expression of other splicing factors, it is likely that other splicing factors contribute to the regulation of Esrp AS targets. RBFOX2 has been shown to co-regulate ESRP AS events, including those associated with EMT, despite only small changes in RBFOX2 expression in EMT (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dittmar et al., 2012</a>).

The increase in EDC gene expression in the DKO epidermis is likely an indirect effect of the loss of the Esrps, but in turn it implicates Esrp regulated splicing in the maintenance of epithelial cell function necessary for barrier function in vivo. For example, we confirmed the differential splicing of several genes that have been evaluated in KO mice for skin barrier function and maturation of cellular junctions. <i>Nf2</i> (<i>Merlin</i>) exhibited a \u2018switch-like\u2019 change in AS in the DKO epidermis, transitioning from nearly full inclusion to full skipping (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Similar to our Krt14-DKO mice, conditional ablation of <i>Nf2</i> using Krt14-Cre resulted in mice with dry, flaky skin, and epidermal barrier defects as measured by water loss assay. Biochemical evaluation identified Nf2 as an interaction partner with the adherens junction (AJ) and Par3 necessary for the maturation of AJ to mature TJs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gladden et al., 2010</a>). While this analysis was performed in complete KO of <i>Nf2</i>, evaluating the isoform specific functions of Nf2 under regulation by the Esrps could provide further insight into the maturation of junctional complexes required for epithelial cells and barrier function. The Esrps directly regulate the levels of <i>Grhl1</i> by promoting exon 5 inclusion and preventing transcript degradation by NMD. Mice lacking Grhl1 have reduced expression of desmosomal cadherins resulting in mild anchoring defects of hair follicles in the skin (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wilanowski et al., 2008</a>). Epidermal barrier defects by way of epidermal hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in adult mice lacking Grhl1 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mlacki et al., 2014</a>). <i>Cd44</i> has a complex pattern of splicing in which the variable region encoded by 10 exons is included in epithelial cells, and skipping of these exons is observed in non-epithelial cells. Mice lacking Cd44, which in the case of the epidermis is the Esrp regulated epithelial form Cd44v, have delays in outside-in barrier formation during embryonic development and barrier formation measured in cultured keratinocytes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kirschner et al., 2011</a>). These examples of Esrp splicing targets involved in skin barrier function highlight the roles of the Esrps in regulating known genes involved in this process. Defects in epithelial barrier function are associated with human disorders in multiple organs including atopic dermatitis, allergen response in respiratory tracts, and gastrointestinal inflammation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Segre, 2006</a>). We predict that numerous Esrp-regulated targets will also be shown to play roles in epithelial barrier function in the skin and other epithelial populations. Thus, the <i>Esrp</i> DKO mice can be used to evaluate isoform-specific functions of known barrier genes, as well as identify novel genes involved in the maintenance of epithelial barrier function via functions of epithelial specific protein isoforms."

The vector features a loxP site in intron 6 upstream of exon 7, a neomycin selection cassette flanked by FRT sites in intron 9 followed by a loxP site. The targeting vector was electroporated into V6.5, hybrid C57BL6/129Sv, mouse ES cells and neomycin resistant clones were isolated. Genomic DNA was prepared from the ES clones and used for screening by PCR and Southern blot using standard techniques. For Southern blot analysis genomic DNA was digested with RE ScaI for 5\u2032 probe B or HpaI for 3\u2032 probe C, gel electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed using 32-P-dCTP labeled probes targeting intron 4 (5\u2032 end) or intron 11 (3\u2032 end) outside of the arms of homology. Clone 1D1 was selected (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), and injected into Balb/c blastocysts and implanted in pseudo-pregnant females. 21 total chimeras were generated, from which males were crossed to C57BL/6J females. Germline transmission was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot as described above. The resulting germline mice served as the basis for both the conditional and KO alleles. The conditional allele was generated by crossing of male #114, from chimera 1.9, to B6(C3)-Tg(Pgk1-FLPo)10Sykr/J females to remove the neomycin cassette. Offspring were screened for removal of the neomycin cassette by PCR analysis. Heterozygous <i>Esrp1</i><sup><i>flox/+</i></sup> mice were crossed to generate homozygous <i>Esrp1</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> conditional mice, with no apparent phenotype, and to maintain the line. The Esrp1 KO allele for ubiquitous ablation of Esrp1 was generated by crossing of male #31, from chimera 1.10, to C57BL/6-Tg(Zp3-cre)93Knw/J females. Resulting offspring were screened by PCR and DNA sequencing for Cre-mediated recombination resulting in the complete deletion of neomycin cassette and the genomic region encoding exons 7\u20139. <i>Esrp1</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> heterozygotes were crossed to generate homozygous <i>Esrp1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> KO mice and line maintenance."

Each RNA sample (1 \u03bcg) was used for poly A selected RNA-seq library preparation using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Biological replicates were individually barcoded, pooled, and split over 2 lanes of a HiSeq 2000 for 100 \u00d7 2 bp paired-end RNA-seq at the Penn Next Generation Sequencing Core (NGSC) Facility. The RNA-seq data has been deposited into the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number GSE64357. We mapped RNA-seq reads to the mouse genome (mm10) and transcriptome (Ensembl, release 72) using the software TopHat (v1.4.1) allowing up to 3 bp mismatches per read and up to 2 bp mismatches per 25 bp seed. We used Cuffdiff (v2.2.0) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Trapnell et al., 2010</a>) to calculate RNA-seq based gene expression levels using the FPKM metric (fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped) then identified differential gene expression between the two cell types at FDR &lt; 5%, &gt;twofold difference in gene expression based on average FPKM, and minFPKM &gt; 0.1. To identify differential AS events between the WT and three knockouts (KO, KH, and DKO), we used rMATS v3.0.8 (<a href=\"http://rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net/\">http://rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net</a>) to identify differential AS events from strand-specific RNA-seq data corresponding to all five basic types of AS patterns (see the entire list in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Briefly, rMATS uses a modified version of the generalized linear mixed model to detect differential AS from RNA-seq data with replicates (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shen et al., 2014</a>). It accounts for exon-specific sequencing coverage in individual samples as well as variation in exon splicing levels among replicates. For each AS event, we used both the reads mapped to the splice junctions and the reads mapped to the exon body as the input for rMATS. Each KO group was compared to the WT group to identify differentially spliced events with an associated change in PSI (\u0394PSI or \u0394\u03c8) of these events. To compute p-values and FDRs of splicing events with |\u0394\u03c8| &gt; 0.01% cutoff, we ran rMATS using -c 0.0001 parameter. The splicing events in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> summarize detected events with an FDR &lt; 5% and |\u0394\u03c8| \u2265 5%."

These SE datasets were comprised of 68 (32 enhanced, 36 silenced) in KO, 97 (54 enhanced, 43 silenced) in KH, and 214 (119 enhanced, 95 silenced) in DKO epidermis. We collected 115 known binding sites of RBPs including many well-characterized splicing factors from the literature (<a href=\"#bib61\">Ule et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dittmar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ray et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Vanharanta et al., 2014</a>). For each motif, we scanned for motif occurrences separately in exons or their 250 bp upstream or downstream intronic sequences. For intronic sequences, we excluded the 20 bp sequence within the 3\u2032 splice site and the 6 bp sequence within the 5\u2032 splice site. Alternative exons without splicing changes (rMATS FDR &gt; 50%, maxPSI &gt; 15%, minPSI &lt; 85%) in highly expressed genes (average FPKM &gt; 5.0 in at least one genetic group) were treated as control exons. For each motif, after we counted the number of occurrences in the differentially spliced exons and the control exons, we calculated p-value for motif enrichment via Fisher's exact test (right-sided) and used Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction to adjust for multiple testing for exons, upstream intronic sequences, and downstream intronic sequences separately. A motif can be counted multiple times in a given sequence (by-NT) or a motif can only be counted zero or one time in a given sequence (by-Sequence). We conducted both approaches and identified enriched motifs at FDR(by-NT) &lt; 5% and p-value(by-Sequence) &lt; 0.01."

We assigned motif scores based on the overall percentage of nucleotides covered by any of 12 Esrp binding sites within a 50-nt window. We slid this window by 1-nt across the exon body and 250 nt of upstream and downstream intron as well as the upstream and downstream exons."

These proteins, discovered by the Carstens lab, control important alternative splicing events in epithelial cells, but the biological roles of their regulatory programs is not well understood. The authors generated conditional KO alleles of the two proteins. As expected from earlier studies, the ESRP1 mutation has a more severe phenotype than the ESRP2. They make germline null mutations in each and characterize the developmental defects in the ESRP1 knockout (KO), this KO with a heterozygous ESRP2 mutation (KOH), and the double KO (DKO). These mutations have extensive, pleotropic phenotypes and exhibit neonatal lethality. For the DKO, the authors describe cleft palate and a variety of cranio-facial defects, defects in forelimb development, and a variety of organ defects including failure to develop lung or salivary gland. Some defects are much reduced in the KO or the KOH mice, demonstrating partial redundancy in the function of the ESRP's. Focusing on the epidermis, the authors' document reduced thickness in the DKO and reduced numbers of follicles. Nevertheless marker gene expression indicates that all the appropriate cell types and layers are present. Using whole transcriptome profiling of gene expression and splicing by RNAseq in dissected epidermis, they identify many changes in splicing in the mutant epidermis, including many known ESRP targets. By examining all combinations of heterozygous and homozygous mutations, they demonstrate differing sensitivities of splicing events to the ESRP proteins. Some transcripts exhibit wild type splicing with one copy of either gene present, but then shift their splicing entirely, with the loss of the last copy. Other transcripts show more graded responses with intermediate levels of splicing in the compound heterozygotes. The authors identify changes in other RNA binding proteins in response to the knockout, but since these are rarely more than 1.5 fold, argue that these changes are unlikely to cause the splicing alterations observed. Motif analyses within the affected exon regions shows enrichment of ESRP sites upstream of ESRP exons, and downstream of ESRP enhanced exons, a pattern observed previously for several splicing regulators, and indicating likely direct regulation by ESRP of most of the altered exons. Cuffdiff is used to examine genes that are differentially expressed in the mutant epidermis, with by far the most changes found in the DKO. By Gene Ontology analysis, these genes are strongly enriched in process terms related to keratinization and epidermal differentiation, with the former downregulated and the latter upregulated. Finally, they use a Keratin-Cre line to specifically knockout the proteins in the basal keratinocytes, observing similar gross phenotype in that tissue and similar changes in splicing and expression. They demonstrate a loss of epidermal integrity in these mice using a water loss assay."

The immunoblots shown do not tell us what cells in those tissues are expressing ESRP1, ESRP2 or both, and when they are expressed. These data are needed to interpret some of these phenotypes, particularly in the more complex genotypes. For example, while reading the manuscript and considering the phenotypes in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, the reader is left wondering where ESRP1/2 are expressed. Are the phenotypes developing in bone/limb because their expression is exclusive to these tissues?"

The finding of 100% penetrant cleft lip associated with cleft palate (CL/P) as the predominant phenotype in mice with ablation of Esrp1 alone is an interesting finding that we wish to feature in a main figure in this first report on these KO mice.

In the resubmission, we outline in more detail why available evidence suggests that while alterations in FGFR splicing may contribute to the epidermal phenotypes, there are almost certainly roles of other splicing changes in other Esrp target transcripts. The degree to which alterations in Fgfr splicing as well as other splicing events is an topic that will be a focus of further investigations."
