In contrast, our knowledge of their specific molecular modes of action is limited to the interaction with few cofactors. Here, we show that Hox proteins are able to interact with a wide range of transcription factors in the live <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. In this context, specificity relies on a versatile usage of conserved short linear motifs (SLiMs), which, surprisingly, often restrains the interaction potential of Hox proteins. This novel buffering activity of SLiMs was observed in different tissues and found in Hox proteins from cnidarian to mouse species. Although these interactions remain to be analysed in the context of endogenous Hox regulatory activities, our observations challenge the traditional role assigned to SLiMs and provide an alternative concept to explain how Hox interactome specificity could be achieved during the embryonic development."

In contrast, our knowledge of their specific molecular modes of action is limited to the interaction with few cofactors. Here, we show that Hox proteins are able to interact with a wide range of transcription factors in the live <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. In this context, specificity relies on a versatile usage of conserved short linear motifs (SLiMs), which, surprisingly, often restrains the interaction potential of Hox proteins. This novel buffering activity of SLiMs was observed in different tissues and found in Hox proteins from cnidarian to mouse species. Although these interactions remain to be analysed in the context of endogenous Hox regulatory activities, our observations challenge the traditional role assigned to SLiMs and provide an alternative concept to explain how Hox interactome specificity could be achieved during the embryonic development."

Ba\u00ebza, Viala, Heim et al. also show that two short sections within the Hox proteins known as short linear motifs are important for controlling these interactions. A fly Hox protein that was missing these motifs was able to interact with new transcription factors. This inhibitory role was found in Hox proteins from mice and sea anemones, suggesting that these motifs may play the same role in all animals."

These compact interaction interfaces are typically less than 10 residues in length and are often located within intrinsically disordered regions of highly connected proteins. Due to their small size, SLiMs exhibit high evolutionary plasticity and mediate interactions with many different types of proteins. Moreover, SLiMs are known to be important for the rewiring of interaction networks, being the subject of tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib13\">Buljan et al., 2013</a>)."

For example, very few SLiMs listed in the current databases relate to the regulatory interaction between transcription factors (TFs) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dinkel et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that this particular type of functional interaction is more difficult to capture than others. More generally, classic large-scale screening methods based on affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS) or yeast two-hybrid are more efficient for detecting stable interactions between structured domains than for revealing transient interactions involving SLiMs (<a href=\"#bib39\">Landry et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, alternative approaches are needed to decipher SLiM-mediated interactions and functions within the context of developmental regulatory networks in vivo."

Hox proteins are homeodomain (HD)-containing TFs present in all cnidarian and bilaterian species (<a href=\"#bib20\">Finnerty, 2003</a>). They are required throughout the embryogenesis for controlling specific cell fates and structures along different axes and in territories as different as the limb bud (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zakany and Duboule, 2007</a>), cardiac outflow tract (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertrand et al., 2011</a>), and female genital disc (<a href=\"#bib22\">Foronda et al., 2005</a>). The specific functions of Hox proteins in vivo contrast with their ability to recognize closely similar DNA-binding sites as monomers in vitro (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berger et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Noyes et al., 2008</a>). This so-called Hox paradox strongly suggests that additional cofactors are required for helping Hox proteins to elicit their diverse and specific transcriptional programs in vivo."

                        "text": "To date, only one type of cofactors is described to specify Hox functions at the molecular level. These cofactors are collectively referred to as the PBC class of HD-containing TFs, and correspond to the Pbx1-4 and Extradenticle (Exd) proteins in mammals and <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, respectively (<a href=\"#bib56\">Mukherjee and B\u00fcrglin, 2007</a>). Biochemical studies have shown that the interaction between Hox and PBC proteins relies on a highly conserved motif of Hox proteins, the hexapeptide (HX) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mann et al., 2009</a>). The HX motif constitutes the generic signature of Hox proteins after key positions within the HD (<a href=\"#bib52\">Merabet et al., 2009</a>). It belongs to the LIG type of SLiM according to the ELM database (<a href=\"http://elm.eu.org/\">http://elm.eu.org/</a>) and contains a core YF/PWM sequence conserved in all but posterior Hox paralogs throughout animal evolution (<a href=\"#bib52\">Merabet et al., 2009</a>). More generally, the HX motif has been defined as corresponding to an invariant Tryptophan residue located in a hydrophobic environment and followed by basic residues from +2 to +5 (<a href=\"#bib75\">In der Rieden et al., 2004</a>). Crystal structures with truncated proteins emphasized the importance of the Tryptophan residue in establishing strong interactions with specific residues of the PBC partner (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mann et al., 2009</a>). However, in vivo analyses showed that mutations within the HX motif (including that of the key Tryptophan residue) did not systematically abolish PBC-dependent functions of Hox proteins (<a href=\"#bib23\">Galant et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Merabet et al., 2003</a>). In addition, Hox-PBC interactions are influenced by the promoter environment and can occur in absence of the HX motif in several cnidarian and bilaterian Hox proteins (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hudry et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2014</a>). Reciprocally, the HX is also required for PBC-independent functions (<a href=\"#bib53\">Merabet et al., 2011</a>) and for interacting with Bip2, a TATA-binding protein associated factor in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Prince et al., 2008</a>). Together these observations highlight that the HX motif is neither a unique nor an obligatory Hox protein interface for recruiting the PBC cofactor, suggesting that Hox-PBC interactions could rely on the presence of other specific SLiM(s). Notably, another motif called UbdA and present in Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and AbdominalA (AbdA) proteins of protostome lineages was recently described to be important for the formation and activity of the Ubx/Exd complex in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Merabet et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hudry et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Foos et al., 2015</a>)."

Given the number of embryonic events controlled by Hox proteins, we hypothesize that Hox SLiMs such as the HX and UbdA motifs could interact with a higher number of TFs. Identifying these TFs represents a major challenge to understand part of the molecular cues underlying Hox transcriptional specificity and diversity in vivo."

As a first step, we identified the respective sets of BiFC interactors of five <i>Drosophila</i> Hox paralogs, showing that each Hox interactome relies on a different combination of TFs. The role of the HX and UbdA motifs was then analysed in several Hox interactomes and in different tissues of the live embryo. Our data establish that the ablation of Hox SLiMs not only prevents several interactions but additionally leads to a number of ectopic interactions. These effects differ depending on the Hox protein and tissue considered, suggesting that SLiM activity could be strongly influenced by the protein environment. Furthermore, results obtained with mouse and cnidarian Hox proteins indicate that the inhibitory activity of SLiMs could be important for restricting the inherent binding potential of intrinsically disordered regions."

In this case, competitive BiFC could not be observed with proteins that are exclusively participating in the AbdA/Exd complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013B\u2032</a>). In addition, the titration of BiFC signals could only occur when the cold interaction is strong enough to disrupt the assembly between AbdA and Exd (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013C\u2032</a>). However, as competitive BiFC could not discriminate between AbdA- and Exd-specific interacting partners (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013C\u2032</a>), a second experimental phase will be necessary to confirm the Hox interaction status. Despite these limitations, we decided to test our hypothesis with a reasonable number of candidate TFs and by using a fast genetic approach. To this end, we established a BiFC reporter fly line expressing AbdA and Exd fusion proteins under the control of the <i>abdA-Gal4</i> driver (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and [<a href=\"#bib30\">Hudry et al., 2011</a>]). This fly line can be crossed with individuals containing any UAS-driven cold candidate-binding partner and BiFC could directly be assessed in the embryo progeny. As a control, we verified that the co-expression of a nuclear-localized form of Exd (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kammermeier et al., 2004</a>) could indeed affect BiFC fluorescent signals in the embryo (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In comparison, co-expressing a red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the same condition did not lead to any changes in the BiFC profile (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We chose a starting set of 80 TFs covering different DNA-binding families and displaying distinct expression profiles in the three main germ layers of the embryo (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). We observed that 33 of those TFs could compete against AbdA/Exd assembly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). Among them we found Biniou (Bin) and Mad, previously described to participate in the regulation of Hox target enhancers (<a href=\"#bib27\">Grienenberger et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Walsh and Carroll, 2007</a>), and Teashirt (Tsh), known to help Hox proteins in specifying the trunk segments of the embryo (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fasano et al., 1991</a>). Thus, these three TFs validate the competition screen. Interestingly, 65% of the tested HD and GATA TFs (9/14 and 4/6, respectively) were positive in the competition test (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), representing a strong tendency compared to the other tested TF classes. In total, none of the 33 competitors was previously described as a binding partner of AbdA or Exd, illustrating the efficiency of the competition screen for revealing new candidate cofactors in vivo."

Indeed, high affinity partners lead to fast accumulation, hence strong BiFC signals, and vice versa (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hudry et al., 2011</a>). Here, levels of BiFC were used to measure the effects of AbdA mutations on the interaction potential with each of the 35 TFs. We first focused on the HD, which is responsible for the DNA-binding and the most conserved part of Hox proteins. The HD of Hox proteins is also described to interact with different types of cofactors (<a href=\"#bib52\">Merabet et al., 2009</a>), suggesting it could be involved in several of the observed interactions. More precisely, we asked (i) whether AbdA-TF interactions could depend on the DNA-binding activity of the HD, and (ii) whether the HD could be sufficient for AbdA-TF interactions. BiFC was performed with two corresponding mutant forms of AbdA: one carrying the N51A mutation in the HD, which abolishes the DNA-binding activity of full length AbdA (AbdA51) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hudry et al., 2011</a>), the other resulting in a truncated version that contains only the HD (AbdAHD) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boube et al., 2014</a>).

Thus, the two corresponding TFs (Pannier and Slouch) preferentially interact with a form of AbdA that is unable to bind DNA. Effects were more drastic with the minimal AbdAHD construct, which kept only eight interactions among the 31 positive TFs (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Each interactome is represented with the 35 TFs. The colour code for TFs corresponds to their type of DNA-binding domain, as shown in the <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>. TFs that are not colour-filled correspond to TFs that do not interact with the wild type Hox protein. Those TFs are not connected to the Hox protein. Dotted lines indicate TFs that do interact with the wild type Hox protein. Interactions with Hox variants are depicted as the following: dotted lines indicate unaffected interactions (in between 51% and 119% of the wild type interaction); solid black lines indicate stronger (equal or superior to 120% of the wild type interaction) or novel interactions (with a non-colour-filled TF); absence of the dotted line with a colour-filled TF indicates a partial (equal or below to 50% of the wild type interaction) or complete loss of the interaction. Each Hox variant is schematized in the centre of the interactome. HD: Homeodomain. HX: Hexapeptide. See also \u2018Materials and methods\u2019."

Interestingly, these HD-surrounding region(s) can also have an inhibitory role since their absence allows the formation of stronger interactions between the HD and two of the tested TFs. Given that HD-surrounding regions are less conserved in Hox proteins in general, we then asked whether some of the revealed interactions could also be found with other <i>Drosophila</i> Hox proteins."

Its role was assessed within each Hox interactome by repeating BiFC between the 35 TFs and the corresponding HX-mutated Hox proteins (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and [<a href=\"#bib31\">Hudry et al., 2012</a>])."

More precisely, the HX mutation affects the majority of Hox-TF interactions. Surprisingly, this mutation leads not only to a loss, but also to a gain of the Hox interaction potential, with the appearance of stronger or new interactions (highlighted in yellow in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The balance between gain and loss was different depending on the Hox protein: Antp and AbdB were more sensitive to a loss while the reverse was observed with Ubx and AbdA. The HX of Scr was equally responsible for a gain or loss of interactions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Overall, the HX mutation leads more often to a gain than a loss of the Hox interaction potential. Interestingly, the positive or negative influence of the HX on Hox-TF interactions is not identical for each TF. For example, the HX mutation has no effect on AbdA-Twist (Twi) interaction, while it leads to a loss of interaction between Antp and AbdB and the same TF, and to a stronger and novel interaction with Ubx and Scr, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, the role of the HX appears dictated by the Hox protein to which it belongs and not by the interacting TF, therefore reinforcing the fact that HX neighbourhood is important for controlling its interaction properties (<a href=\"#bib49\">Merabet and Hudry, 2011</a>)."

Effects can also be categorized as a gain or a loss of the interaction potential. However, the UbdA motif has a more pronounced tendency to be required for the interaction rather than for inhibiting it (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>). For example, the UbdA mutation leads to 12 loses and 5 gains among the 20 tested TFs with AbdA. In comparison, 3 losses and 12 gains were induced upon the HX mutation for the same set of interactions. In addition, the HX and UbdA mutations have distinct effects for the majority of interactions established by Ubx or AbdA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>). This result highlights that the two Hox proteins do not use the HX and UbdA motifs similarly. Interestingly, the UbdA mutation often leads to similar effects in Ubx and AbdA compared to the HX mutation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013E</a>). More precisely, the UbdA mutation affects the majority (13/20) of the tested TFs in a similar way, which is not the case for the HX mutation (8/20)."

Since the HD is unlikely to be sufficient for several of those interactions (as deduced from AbdA: <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), we decided to test the N-terminal region of HoxE. We thus generated fly lines carrying a short HoxE variant, called Nter-HoxE, which corresponds to the residues 1 to 54 and does not contain the HX motif (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). BiFC with the 35 <i>Drosophila</i> TFs shows that only five interactions are lost when using this short variant of HoxE (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, this fragment interacts more strongly or establishes new interactions with seven TFs while 15 other interactions remained unaffected. In total, Nter-HoxE establishes as many interactions as the full length HoxE."

As a consequence, the interactome underlying Hox embryonic functions remains largely elusive.

We hypothesize that many of those interactions are too weak and/or too dynamic to be efficiently trapped through classic high throughput approaches. In support of this, a yeast two-hybrid screen with the <i>Drosophila</i> Ubx protein led to the characterization of less than 15 TFs as interacting partners (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bondos et al., 2006</a>), strongly contrasting with the numerous functions ensured by this Hox protein during embryogenesis.

For example, some of the interactions revealed with the fusion Scr protein are unlikely to occur with the endogenous Scr product, which displays a quite restrained expression profile in the embryo compared to the other tested Hox proteins (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a> and [<a href=\"#bib28\">Hammonds et al., 2013</a>]). In addition, the fact that TF-encoding genes were not expressed under the control of their endogenous promoter forbids assessing the role of tissue-specific expression levels in Hox interactome properties. In this context, the recent advent of genetic tools in <i>Drosophila</i>, including Mimic elements (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gnerer et al., 2015</a>) and the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bassett and Liu, 2014</a>), could certainly add to the functional relevance of BiFC observations in the future. Nevertheless, the high proportion of positive events among a starting set of 80 TFs strongly suggests that AbdA, and Hox proteins in general, have a strong potential to interact with a number of different TFs in vivo. This assumption could be verified by using a library of 600 TFs compatible for BiFC in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bischof et al., 2013</a>)."

In addition, the common HX motif is not similarly used in the different Hox interactomes. Interaction properties of the HX motif were also different depending on the tissue considered, highlighting the strong flexibility and adaptability of this motif to the surrounding protein environment. Restricting the analysis to the closely related Ubx and AbdA proteins did not reveal a higher level of similarity in the interaction properties of the HX motif.

Along the same line, the HX mutation increases the interaction potential of Ubx with Exd in vivo (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hudry et al., 2012</a>), and confers an AbdA-like activity to Ubx for segment specification in the epidermis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Galant et al., 2002</a>). Similarly, the mouse HoxB8 protein was shown to provoke dominant negative phenotypes in absence of its HX motif (<a href=\"#bib47\">Medina-martinez &amp; Ram\u0131, 2003</a>), which is also difficult to reconcile with a simple loss of interactions. Finally, the interaction between HoxA11 and Foxo1a in placental mammal lineages is reported to result from the loss of a specific Foxo1a\u2013inhibitory interaction domain and not from the gain of a new binding interface in HoxA11 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brayer et al., 2011</a>). The gain of interaction between HoxA11 and Foxo1a comprises one of the major regulatory events that led to placentation in mammals, illustrating a so far unexpected role of a PPI inhibitory domain in interactome rewiring during evolution (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lynch et al., 2008</a>)."

We propose different models for explaining the underlying molecular mechanisms. In the classic situation, SLiMs are positively used as context-specific interaction modules, together with globular domains, for the recruitment of cell-specific cofactors (cell context 1 in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Alternatively, SLiMs could also be important for restraining the interaction potential (cell contexts 2 and 3 in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). In one mechanism, the inhibitory activity would rely on the interaction with a particular partner that will mask or forbid the recruitment of the other SLiM-interacting cofactors (cell context 2 in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). This mechanism implies that the interaction between the SLiM and the hiding partner will be strong and stable enough to overcome the binding of the other cofactors. In a second mechanism, SLiMs could also directly act as a masking peptide, preventing recognition and/or binding of undesired cofactors (cell context 3 in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). SLiMs are classically required to make interactions with structured globular domains in <i>trans</i> (<a href=\"#bib67\">Stein and Aloy, 2008</a>), but intramolecular contacts following post-translational modifications have also been reported in a few cases (<a href=\"#bib60\">Pawson et al., 2001</a>). Thus, SLiMs could also establish interactions in <i>cis</i>, potentially upon cell-specific modifications (i.e., phosphorylations), to eventually inhibit the recruitment of inappropriate cofactors. A similar role was previously described for the HX motif of Labial, which is able to prevent the binding of the HD on the DNA (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chan et al., 1996</a>). Interestingly, this inhibition is relieved upon interaction with Exd, highlighting the influence of the environment on the SLiM inhibitory activity."

This protein will present different interaction properties with a set of cofactors that could vary depending on the cell context considered. Preferential interactions between cofactors and the protein domain and SLiMs are represented by a colour code. Black bars symbolize the various levels of interaction affinity. In the cell context 1, cofactors are recruited through specific interactions with the globular domain and the two SLiMs. In the cell context 2, there is a supplementary triangular cofactor that displays higher affinity with the red SLiM than the square cofactor. As a consequence, interaction will occur with this triangular (hiding) cofactor, which forbids the interaction with the other SLiM. In this context, the red SLiM behaves as an inhibitory interaction motif. In the cell context 3, post-translational modifications in the disordered region (yellow stars) allow the inhibitory SLiM to establish interactions in <i>cis</i> with the globular domain. These intra-molecular contacts forbid the binding of the other cofactors. The last two mechanisms illustrate how the inhibitory activity of SLiMs could help in distinguishing/specifying interactomes with an identical set of cofactors."

This molecular strategy has certainly been underestimated to date. We propose that the inhibiting interaction properties of SLiMs could apply more generally to the fine-tuning of highly connected interactomes. It is interesting to note that SLiMs can also be produced as individual molecules from short open reading frames (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kondo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Magny et al., 2013</a>) or even from long non coding RNAs (<a href=\"#bib64\">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2014</a>).

Fluorescent revelation (with a secondary anti-chicken antibody coupled to AlexaFluor488, Abcam150169) was used to compare the expression level between the different conditions with wild type and mutated Hox fusion constructs. The temperature for each fly cross was adjusted accordingly, allowing comparing BiFC signals with Hox fusion proteins expressed at similar levels.

We did not emphasize a self-criticism further since our purpose was to assess the interaction potential of Hox proteins with transcription factors. In addition, understanding the functional contribution of the newly identified interactions will constitute a real project on its own and will go beyond the framework of our message. Nevertheless, we fully agree that more caution should be taken regarding the functional relevance of our data. This concern is particularly important given that BiFC analyses were not performed with the endogenous promoter of TF-encoding genes. BiFC could certainly be improved in the future thanks to the advent of powerful genetic tools (Mimic elements and Crispr technology for example) that now allow generating endogenous fusion proteins in a more systematic and efficient way."

We realize that the way we introduced the competitive BiFC for pre-selecting putative AbdA-interacting partners was indeed not sufficiently clear. Still, this introducing part is important for the understanding of our experimental strategy, which could serve in the future for other studies aiming at rapidly selecting candidate interacting partners. We thus believe that competitive BiFC should be considered as an integrant part of our approach. To be less confusing, we completely rephrased the corresponding paragraphs in the first and second sections of the Results and depicted all the different theoretical cases for non-competitive and competitive BiFC in a new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A-C</a>). The word \u201cindependent\u201d was no longer used since it could be misinterpreted. We added more information about the limitation of the approach to emphasize the type of interactions that could be or could not be trapped by competitive BiFC. Finally, everything was directly linked to the main objective of finding putative AbdA interacting partners for better clarity."
