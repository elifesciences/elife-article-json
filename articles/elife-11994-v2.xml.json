There is no correlation, however, between body size and cancer risk. This lack of correlation is often referred to as 'Peto's Paradox'. Here, we show that the elephant genome encodes 20 copies of the tumor suppressor gene <i>TP53</i> and that the increase in <i>TP53</i> copy number occurred coincident with the evolution of large body sizes, the evolution of extreme sensitivity to genotoxic stress, and a hyperactive TP53 signaling pathway in the elephant (Proboscidean) lineage. Furthermore, we show that several of the <i>TP53</i> retrogenes (<i>TP53RTGs</i>) are transcribed and likely translated. While <i>TP53RTGs</i> do not appear to directly function as transcription factors, they do contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of elephant cells to DNA damage and the induction of apoptosis by regulating activity of the TP53 signaling pathway. These results suggest that an increase in the copy number of <i>TP53</i> may have played a direct role in the evolution of very large body sizes and the resolution of Peto's paradox in Proboscideans."

There is no correlation, however, between body size and cancer risk. This lack of correlation is often referred to as 'Peto's Paradox'. Here, we show that the elephant genome encodes 20 copies of the tumor suppressor gene <i>TP53</i> and that the increase in <i>TP53</i> copy number occurred coincident with the evolution of large body sizes, the evolution of extreme sensitivity to genotoxic stress, and a hyperactive TP53 signaling pathway in the elephant (Proboscidean) lineage. Furthermore, we show that several of the <i>TP53</i> retrogenes (<i>TP53RTGs</i>) are transcribed and likely translated. While <i>TP53RTGs</i> do not appear to directly function as transcription factors, they do contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of elephant cells to DNA damage and the induction of apoptosis by regulating activity of the TP53 signaling pathway. These results suggest that an increase in the copy number of <i>TP53</i> may have played a direct role in the evolution of very large body sizes and the resolution of Peto's paradox in Proboscideans."

The maximum lifespan among vertebrates, for example, ranges from over 211 years in the bowhead whale (<i>Balaena mysticetus</i>) to only 59 days in the pygmy goby (<i>Eviota sigillata</i>) whereas body sizes ranges from 136,000 kg in the blue whale (<i>Balaenoptera musculus</i>) to 0.5 g in the Eastern red-backed salamander (<i>Plethodon cinereus</i>) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Healy et al., 2014</a>). Similar to other life history traits, such as body size and metabolic rate or body size and age at maturation, body size and lifespan are strongly correlated such that larger species tend to live longer than smaller species (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). While abiotic and biological factors have been proposed as major drivers of maximum body size evolution in animals, maximum body size within tetrapods appears to be largely determined by biology (<a href=\"#bib76\">Smith et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Sookias et al., 2012</a>). Mammals, for example, likely share biological constraints on the evolution of very large body sizes with rare breaks in those constraints underlying the evolution of gigantism in some lineages (<a href=\"#bib77\">Sookias et al., 2012</a>), such as Proboscideans (elephants and their and extinct relatives), Cetaceans (whales), and the extinct hornless rhinoceros <i>Paraceratherium</i> (\u2018Walter\u2019)."

If all cells have a similar risk of malignant transformation and equivalent cancer suppression mechanisms, organism with many cells should have a higher risk of developing cancer than organisms with fewer cells; Similarly organisms with long lifespans have more time to accumulate cancer-causing mutations than organisms with shorter lifespans and therefore should be at an increased risk of developing cancer, a risk that is compounded in large bodied, long-lived organisms (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cairns, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Caulin and Maley, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Doll, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Peto, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Peto et al., 1975</a>).

We found that the elephant genome encodes a single <i>TP53</i> gene and 19 <i>TP53</i> retrogenes, several of which are transcribed and translated in elephant tissues. Comparison of the African and Asian elephant TP53 gene copy number with the copy number in the genome of the extinct American mastodon, woolly mammoth, and Columbian mammoth indicates that copy number increased relatively rapidly coincident with the evolution of large body-sizes in the Proboscidean lineage. Finally, we show that elephant cells have an enhanced response to DNA-damage that is mediated by a hyperactive TP53 signaling pathway and that this augmented TP53 signaling is dependent upon TP53 retrogenes and can be transferred to the cells of other species through exogenous expression of elephant TP53 retrogenes. These results suggest that the origin of large body sizes, long lifespans, and enhanced cancer resistance in the elephant lineage evolved at least in part through reinforcing the anti-cancer mechanisms of the major \u2018guardian of the genome\u2019 TP53."

As expected, we identified a single canonical TP53 gene in these species and estimated the <i>TP53RTG</i> copy number in the Asian elephant genome to be 12\u201317, approximately 14 in both the Columbian and woolly mammoth genomes, and 3\u20138 in the 50,000\u2013130,000 year old American mastodon genome (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data indicate that large-scale expansion of the <i>TP53RTG</i> gene family occurred in the Proboscidean lineage and suggest that <i>TP53RTG</i> copy number was lower in ancient Proboscideans such as the mastodon, which diverged from the elephant lineage\u00a0~\u00a025 MYA (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rohland et al., 2010</a>), than in recent species such as elephants and mammoths."

Consistent with copy number expansion through a single retrotransposition event followed by repeated rounds of segmental duplication, we found that each <i>TP53RTG</i> retrogene was flanked by nearly identical clusters of transposable elements (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and embedded within a large genomic region with greater than 80% sequence similarity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Similarly UV-C exposure generally induced more elephant cells to undergo apoptosis than other species (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). A striking exception to this trend was the response of elephant cells to the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3a, which elicited a strong TP53 transcriptional response (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) but did not induce apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

We then transiently transfected mouse 3T3-L1 cells with the <i>TP53RTG12</i> pcDNA3.1(+)/myc-His expression vector and used the pGL4.38[<i>luc2P</i>/p53 RE/Hygro] reporter system and ApoToxGlo assays to monitor activation of the TP53 signaling pathway and the induction of apoptosis in response to treatment with mitomycin C, doxorubicin, nutlin-3a, or UV-C. We found that heterologous expression of TP53RTG12 in mouse 3T3-L1 cells dramatically augmented luciferase expression from the pGL4.38[<i>luc2P</i>/p53 RE/Hygro] reporter vector in response to each treatment (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) compared to empty vector controls, consistent with a enhancement of the endogenous TP53 signaling pathway. Similarly, expression of TP53RTG12 significantly augmented the induction of apoptosis in response to each treatment although the effect sizes were modest (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). These data indicate that TP53RTG12 acts via a trans-dominant mechanism to enhance the induction of apoptosis by endogenous TP53 and that TP53RTG12 is sufficient to recapitulate at least some of the enhanced sensitivity of elephant cells to DNA damage. Furthermore, our observation that transfection with the <i>TP53RTG12</i> pcDNA3.1(+)/myc-His expression vector augments TP53 signaling and apoptosis suggests that the TP53RTG12 protein rather than transcript is responsible for these effects because the <i>TP53RTG12</i> transgene was synthetized with mouse codon usage and is only 73% (394/535 nts) identical to the elephant <i>TP53RTG12</i> gene."

Previous crystallographic studies of the TP53/MDM2 interaction have shown that a trio of residues in TP53 (F19, W23, and L26) insert deeply into a hydrophobic cleft in MDM2, which stabilizes the interaction (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kussie et al., 1996</a>). We identified a W23G substitution in all TP53RTG proteins at a site that is invariant for tryptophan in TP53 proteins including African and Asian elephant TP53 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>), suggesting that TP53RTG proteins may be unable to physically interact with MDM2. To infer the structural and functional consequences of the TP53RTG W23G substitution we generated a homology model of the elephant TP53RTG12/MDM2 complex using I-TASSER/ModRefiner (<a href=\"#bib73\">Roy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Xu and Zhang, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Zhang, 2008</a>) and the crystal structure of the MDM2/TP53 dimer as a template (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kussie et al., 1996</a>).

Indeed, three methods (<a href=\"#bib65\">Pires et al., 2014</a>) inferred that the W23G substitution is destabilizing on the TP53RTG12/MDM2 interaction (mCSM \u0394\u0394G\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.42, SDM \u0394\u0394G\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125.46, DUET \u0394\u0394G\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.38) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>).

The TP53 dimer is stabilized by hydrophobic and polar interactions including a shell of nonpolar interactions formed by P177, H178, M243, and G244 and a stabilization network next to the nonpolar layer formed by charged residues from the two monomers (R181, E180, and R174). In addition, several polar and charged residues nearby but not within the dimerization interface contribute to the stability of the interacting monomers including D184 with R175, most of which are conserved in TP53RTG proteins (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G</a>). To infer if derived residues in the TP53RTG12 dimerization interface might disrupt a physical interaction between TP53RTG12 and TP53 we generated a homology model of the TP53RTG12/TP53 dimer using I-TASSER/ModRefiner (<a href=\"#bib73\">Roy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Xu and Zhang, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Zhang, 2008</a>) and the crystal structure of the TP53 tetramer as a template (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kitayner et al., 2006</a>).

Unlike the MDM2 interaction site, TP53RTG12-specific substitutions were predicted to maintain intermolecular hydrophobic interactions with TP53 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10H</a>). Consistent with maintenance of dimerization potential, the net \u0394\u0394G of the derived amino acid substitutions in the TP53RTG12 dimerization interface were under 2 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10I</a>).

There is no correlation, however, between body size or lifespan and cancer risk because large and long-lived organisms have evolved enhanced cancer suppression mechanisms that delay the development of cancer until post-reproduction (when selection generally cannot act). This simple evolutionary rational demands mechanistic explanations (<a href=\"#bib64\">Peto, 2015</a>), which have thus far been elusive. Here we show that the master tumor suppressor TP53, which is essential for preventing cancer because it triggers proliferative arrest and apoptosis in response to a variety of stresses such as DNA damage, was retroduplicated in the Paenungulate stem-lineage and rapidly increased in copy number through repeated segmental duplications during with the evolution of Proboscideans. The expansion of the <i>TP53RTG</i> gene family occurred coincident with the evolution of large body sizes and enhanced sensitivity of elephant cells to genotoxic stress, suggesting that Proboscideans resolved Peto\u2019s paradox at least in part through the evolution of augmented TP53 signaling."

Each model is associated with a distinct set of genomic \u2018fingerprints\u2019.

Thus, the initial TP53RTG genes were unlikely to be transcribed and incur a cost. Similarly, our phylogenetic analyses indicates that copy number expanded after the initial <i>TP53RTG</i> gene acquired several mutations, including a premature stop codon that terminates the protein before the DNA-binding domain, which likely reduces or completely eliminates the costs associated with TP53 target gene regulation. Although more detailed evolutionary and comparative analyses are required to determine if <i>TP53RTG</i> genes incurred a cost, it is possible that the costs were minimized because functional <i>TP53RTG</i> genes evolved through non-functional intermediates, which accumulated loss of function mutations that minimized redundancy with <i>TP53</i>."

At confluency, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged at 90 g for 10 min and resuspended in nucleofection/supplement solution and incubated for 15 min. After incubation 1ug of the pGL4.38[<i>luc2p</i>/p53 RE/Hygro] luciferase reporter vector and 100 ng of the pGL4.74[<i>hRluc</i>/TK] Renilla reporter vector were transiently transfected into an\u00a0elephant and hyrax cells using the Amaxa Basic Nucleofector Kit (Lonza) using protocol T-016. Immediately following nuleofection, 10<sup>4</sup> cells were seeded into each well of an opaque bottomed 96-well plate, leaving a column with no cells (background control); each 96-well plate contained paired elephant and hyrax samples. 24 hr after nucleofection cells were treated with either vehicle control, Doxorubicin, Mitomycin c, Nutlin-3a, or 50 J/m<sup>2</sup>UV-C. Luciferase expression was assayed 18 hr after drug/UV-C treatment cells, using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) in a GloMax-Multi+ Reader (Promega). For all experiments luciferase expression was standardized to Renilla expression to control for differences nucleofection efficiency across samples; Luc./Renilla data is standardized to (Luc./Renilla) expression in untreated control cells. Each luciferase experiment was replicated three independent times."

In contrast, Schiffman et al. employed RT-PCR to document expression of 'retrogenes'. How many of the retrogenes are actually expressed?

Here, the authors describe a 'transdominant' effect that does not involve MDM2 binding. In contrast, the work by Schiffman et al. concludes that the retroproteins do bind to MDM2. The data from both papers is weak in this regard. If RTG12 does not bind to MDM2 as indicated in this paper, how is then its expression controlled upon DNA damage? What is the mechanism by which UVC leads to significantly more expression of RTG12? To address this issue, the authors should test whether RTG12 induction is at the level of RNA or protein stability, and to define whether Nutlin (an inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 interaction) also induces protein accumulation in this setting. Furthermore, their current model does not include stabilization of RTG12 protein upon DNA damage. How does RTG12 in this manuscript compare to RTG9 in the paper by Schiffman et al? Could it be that differences in putative binding to MDM2 among the two papers are due to sequence variations in the N-terminus domain of the various retroproteins? To address this, the reviewers request a figure showing aminoacid and nucleotide alignments of the N-terminus transactivation domain regions for all RTGs, highlighting the residues known to be important for transactivation and binding to MDM2, and including all proper Genbank identifiers for each sequence. One of the reviewers pointed out that the MDM2 binding site is mutated in all the TP53RTG proteins (for those that initiate at the first ATG). Furthermore, the same Reviewer observed that, from analysis of the sequences available in Genbank, all the TP53RTGs except one can produce a protein of at least 79 amino-acids, as some TP53RTG can be translated from codon 728 or 940. This should be discussed in the revised manuscript. To further support their 'transdominant' mechanism, the authors should simply perform co-immunoprecipitation of full-length p53 protein using the C-terminal p53-specific 421 monoclonal antibody (the epitope is conserved in the elephant p53 protein). The 421 antibody will not bind to TP53RTG proteins, which lack the 421 epitope. Thus, the co-immunoprecipitation of TP53RTG proteins with full-length elephant p53 protein will unequivocally prove the formation of a protein complex with full-length p53. Finally, the authors propose that the TP53RTG proteins inhibit tetramerization of p53. However, tetramerization of p53 is absolutely required for p53 transcriptional activity. In addition, MG132 seems to induce ubiquitination of p53 in elephant cells treated with DNA-damaging agents despite expression of TP53RTG12. Therefore, the model involving inhibition of tetramerization and ubiquitination is not possible. Altogether, the experiments proposed here will enable the authors to produce a more accurate model of p53 regulation by the p53 retroproteins in elephant cells."

Reviewers were concerned about the use of ectopic overexpression of TP53RTG12 in mouse cells and human HEK293 cells. The observed phenotypes (e.g. hypersensitivity to DNA damage) could be due to artifact-prone overexpression analysis. In addition, it is well established that p53 is inactivated and stabilized by a viral transforming protein in HEK293 cells. Therefore, the value of the MDM2 experiments conducted in HEK293 cells is unclear. In order to unequivocally demonstrate that TP53RTGs regulate the p53-dependent cellular response to DNA damage, the authors must knockdown endogenous TP53RTG expression using TP53RTG-specific siRNAs in elephant cells. Since the authors have identified long nucleotide sequences unique to TP53RTG mRNAs, it is then possible to design siRNAs that will reduce TP53RTG expression without affecting TP53 expression in elephant cells. It will be possible then for the authors to test their hypothesis in elephant cells. Furthermore, transfection of TP53RTG siRNA would enable the authors to unequivocally identify the protein bands corresponding to TP53RTG proteins via Western blot."

In addition to the siRNA experiments mentioned above, reviewers pointed out that the authors cannot accurately identify and name the p53 isoforms observed in their electrophoresis experiments. The elephant p53 protein has no methionine at codon133 and p53psy has not been demonstrated in elephant cells. Furthermore, the bands above 50kD may be polymers or ubiquitinated p53 proteins or cross-reacting bands. Thus, it is essential to define the identity of these bands with TP53 siRNAs (the C-terminal region would provide ample sequence space to design these siRNAs). Also, the protein molecular weight marker is not displayed in any of the immunoblots, which prevents proper interpretation of these results."

The p53 literature abounds with studies exploring the impact of additional copies of the p53 gene, including 'retrogenes'. The reviewers concluded that this manuscript would be much improved by a thorough discussion of these studies. For example, the authors should discuss the p53 pseudogenes in mouse and rat, which are expressed and seem to compromise the activity of functional p53. Importantly, it is well established that an extra copy of full-length p53 in mice leads to hyperactive apoptotic activity, shortening the lifespan of the organism and also inducing neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the authors should discuss the 'super p53' mouse models (Garc\u00eda-Cao et al., EMBO J 2002; Tyner et al., Nature 2002; Maier et al. Genes and Dev 2004)."

How could the authors conclude that the low cancer incidence in elephants is due to the 'multiple copies' of p53 pseudogenes, while the effects of all TP53RTGs seem to be driven by a single retrogene, TP53RTG12? In fact, the authors show that all the TP53RTGs are expressed in the RNA seq data -although at very variable levels-, and they should emphasize this observation; otherwise the story does not reconcile with the existence of two expressed p53 pseudogenes in rat and the two or single expressed p53 pseudogenes in mouse (Tanooka et al., Cancer Res. 1998 and Gene 2001). The authors made a very important discovery, as elephant species may have evolved a molecular mechanism to uncouple the tumor suppressive activity of p53 from its pro-ageing activity. Therefore, the authors should elaborate on whether it is the number of RTGs and/or the tissue specific expression of RTGs and/or the type of RTG (i.e. as defined by the amino-acid sequence of the RTG) that fine tunes p53 activities toward enhanced tumor suppression without hyper-reactivity to cellular stress."

What is the mechanism by which UVC leads to significantly more expression of RTG12? To address this issue, the authors should test whether RTG12 induction is at the level of RNA or protein stability, and to define whether Nutlin (an inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 interaction) also induces protein accumulation in this setting.
