Several studies have demonstrated that increases in the high mutation rates inherent to RNA viruses lead to viral extinction in cell culture, but evidence during infections in vivo is limited. In this study, we show that the broad-range antiviral nucleoside favipiravir reduces viral load in vivo by exerting antiviral mutagenesis in a mouse model for norovirus infection. Increased mutation frequencies were observed in samples from treated mice and were accompanied with lower or in some cases undetectable levels of infectious virus in faeces and tissues. Viral RNA isolated from treated animals showed reduced infectivity, a feature of populations approaching extinction during antiviral mutagenesis. These results suggest that favipiravir can induce norovirus mutagenesis in vivo, which in some cases leads to virus extinction, providing a proof-of-principle for the use of favipiravir derivatives or mutagenic nucleosides in the clinical treatment of noroviruses."

Previous experiments performed on cells grown in the laboratory suggested that favipiravir works against RNA viruses by increasing how often these mutations occur. RNA viruses naturally experience a large number of mutations and the ability to make mutations is in fact a benefit for viruses as it allows them to evolve rapidly and to escape immune responses. However, there is a limit to how many mutations can be tolerated in the viral genome before it can no longer replicate. Therefore, a slight increase in how often mutations occur\u2014as thought to be caused by favipiravir\u2014is able to stop the RNA virus replicating and halt the infection. However, favipiravir's mode of action had yet to be confirmed in living animals."

Treatment increased the number of mutations that occurred when the viral RNA replicated and could reduce the amount of virus in the mice to undetectable levels. In addition, favipiravir did not show toxicity in mice after 8 weeks of treatment. This suggests that favipiravir has the potential to be used safely and effectively to treat norovirus and other RNA viruses, although further studies are required before it can be developed into a clinical treatment."

Genetic variability confers viral populations the flexibility to rapidly adapt to the environment, typically the host, and respond to different selective constraints such as the immune system or antiviral compounds (<a href=\"#bib22\">Domingo et al., 2008</a>). As a consequence, changes in the replication fidelity of a virus can affect its virulence and transmission during natural infections (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Vignuzzi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bull et al., 2010</a>). Recent evidence suggests that RNA virus replication error rates are finely balanced to generate ample diversity while maintaining sufficient accuracy in the transmission of genetic information (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Vignuzzi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Levi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gn\u00e4dig et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sanz-Ramos et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rozen-Gagnon et al., 2014</a>). Pioneering theoretical studies on self-replicating genomes suggested that any live organism has a maximum error rate tolerated to copy its genome. Given their elevated mutation rates, it was anticipated that RNA viruses exist close to their corresponding tolerated threshold (<a href=\"#bib65\">Swetina and Schuster, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Domingo, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Eigen, 2002</a>). Hence, slight increases in virus mutation frequencies might result in the extinction of the replicating population (<a href=\"#bib25\">Eigen, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Domingo et al., 2010</a>). These predictions led to the proposal of lethal mutagenesis of viruses as a new therapeutic approach based on reducing the fidelity of genome replication."

Although some of the antiviral compounds with mutagenic activity in cell culture are also reported to have antiviral activity in vivo, controversy exists regarding the therapeutic mechanism. To date, the most successful antiviral compound with mutagenic activity in cell culture is purine analogue ribavirin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Crotty et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Maag et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brochot et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Perales et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Moreno et al., 2011</a>). Ribavirin is commonly used in combination with pegylated interferon in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. There are contradictory results on whether the mode of action of ribavirin on HCV in vivo is due to mutagenesis, immunomodulatory activities, or other antiviral mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib32\">Graci and Cameron, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chevaliez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lutchman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Perelson and Layden, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chung et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dietz et al., 2013</a>). Although increased HCV mutation frequencies have been reported in several cases (<a href=\"#bib4\">Asahina et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dietz et al., 2013</a>), some studies have not found increased mutagenesis as a factor contributing to the associated antiviral activity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chevaliez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lutchman et al., 2007</a>). Therefore there remains an open question as to whether or not ribavirin-mediated antiviral activity in vivo is as a result of mutagenesis or one of the other reported mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib32\">Graci and Cameron, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chevaliez et al., 2007</a>).

Favipiravir caused significant decreases in virus titres and viral RNA levels and led to the clearance of infectious virus in the faeces of seven out of nine animals (only two out of ten animals did not shed detectable infectious virus in control group). Blind passaging of faecal and tissue samples in cell culture confirmed that favipiravir treatment led to viral extinction in some animals. In contrast, ribavirin showed limited efficacy in vivo which correlated with lower antiviral activity in cell culture when compared to favipiravir. Favipiravir antiviral activity in vivo was associated with a significant increase in viral mutation frequencies. Viral RNA isolated from faeces of treated animals showed decreased specific infectivity, and infectious virus from faeces showed decreased fitness in tissue culture. These data suggest that favipiravir causes increased mutagenesis leading to decreased infectivity and fitness of viral genomes, both features of viral populations approaching extinction during mutagenesis. These results constitute a proof of concept for lethal mutagenesis in vivo and support antiviral therapies based on mutagenic compounds at the clinical level. The data also support the use of favipiravir in the treatment of norovirus infections for which there are not yet licenced antivirals or vaccines available and highlight a need for further studies on favipiravir and other improved derivatives as possible broad-range antiviral strategies."

Favipiravir inhibition occurred in a gradual manner, with the greatest reduction in virus titre being observed at later time points (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). This result is suggestive of a cumulative antiviral activity often observed with increasing number of mutations in viral genomes during successive rounds of replication. In contrast, ribavirin inhibited norovirus replication from an early time point (8 hr), suggesting a different mechanism of action, an additional antiviral activity relative to favipiravir, or potentially due to a different mutational spectrum activity elicited by these two compounds. However, it is alternatively possible that the delayed inhibition shown by favipiravir compared to ribavirin reflects the fact that it takes several more steps to convert favipiravir to the active form (<a href=\"#bib27\">Furuta et al., 2005</a>). To investigate this possibility, we repeated the kinetics by incubating the cells overnight with favipiravir before infection to facilitate favipiravir conversion into favipiravir-triphosphate. No major differences were observed with cells pre-incubated during 1 hr or overnight with favipiravir (data not shown), which suggests that ribavirin might be a more potent inhibitor of viral RNA replication. To confirm this possibility, we determined the viral RNA synthesis kinetics for MNV-3 in the presence of both compounds and confirmed that ribavirin inhibits viral RNA synthesis from an early time post-infection, while the effects of favipiravir are only observed at later time points (data not shown)."

To determine whether ribavirin and favipiravir treatment resulted in greater mutation frequencies, we carried out sequence analysis of individual molecular clones isolated from populations subjected to 4 passages in the presence of either 200 \u03bcM ribavirin or favipiravir. We found that both compounds caused significant increases in the mutation frequencies of replicating virus. Ribavirin treatment resulted in a \u223cthreefold increase while favipiravir led to a five to sixfold increase in the number of mutations per nucleotide (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

To investigate whether these compounds reduced the infectivity of treated norovirus populations, we serially passaged MNV in the presence of either ribavirin or favipiravir (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, respectively). In both cases, lower virus titres and encapsidated viral RNA levels were observed during passage in cell culture. After 5 passages, virus titres for MNV-1 treated with 400 \u03bcM favipiravir, and MNV-3 treated with either 400 \u03bcM ribavirin or favipiravir were close to or below the detection limit, indicating that ribavirin and favipiravir can cause lethal mutagenesis of MNV. We confirmed that MNV-3 was extinguished after 5 passages in the presence of 400 \u03bcM favipiravir, by three consecutive blind passages in RAW264.7 cells in the absence of the drug. The specific infectivity, a measure of the ratio of infectious virus per encapsidated genome, was consistently reduced during passages in the presence of favipiravir for both MNV strains. However, treatment with ribavirin resulted in decreased specific infectivity only for MNV-3 treated with the highest concentration (400 \u03bcM). This suggests that the lower mutagenic activity exhibited by ribavirin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) is responsible for this limited effect on specific infectivity. MNV-3 was more sensitive to favipiravir and ribavirin than MNV-1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3 and 4</a>), although this difference could not be associated with significant variations in the mutation frequency values between these strains during infections in treated or untreated cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This different behaviour may be related to the observation that MNV-3 has lower fitness than MNV-1 (compare virus titre yields for untreated infections in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 3 and 4</a>) which can result in a greater sensitivity to mutagenesis, as previously reported for other viruses (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sierra et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Pariente et al., 2001</a>). Confirming this possibility, a tissue culture-adapted MNV-3 population (18 serial passages in cell culture) responded similarly to MNV-1 when treated with 400 \u03bcM ribavirin (data not shown)."

Animals were infected 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment to allow the establishment of a persistent infection. In a preliminary experiment (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we found that all the animals treated with favipiravir had lower virus titres (5/5) in their faeces while only 2 out of 5 animals treated with ribavirin had consistently lower titres (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that favipiravir is more efficient than ribavirin in the control of norovirus replication in vivo, in agreement with data obtained in tissue culture. Hence, we conducted further experiments to determine whether favipiravir can drive lethal mutagenesis of MNV-3 during persistent infection in mice. With this aim, we treated mice persistently infected with MNV-3 with either placebo or 600 mg/kg/day of favipiravir for 8 weeks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Favipiravir was effective in the control of persistent norovirus replication in vivo with decreased virus titres and RNA levels in faeces observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5 and 6</a>) at very beginning of the treatment (day 1) and throughout the entire treatment period (day 53). A predicted half-life of 31 days is calculated for virus clearance in favipiravir-treated mice in contrast with 122 days in the untreated group (p = 0.0064, log-rank test; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

BHK-21 cells support MNV replication but not virus (re)infection, resulting in a single round of replication for the transfected genomes and a better correlation between infectious genome units and virus titre.

Due to the elevated mutation frequencies in RNA viruses, it was predicted that an increase in the replication error rate might result in the extinction of the viral population (<a href=\"#bib25\">Eigen, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Domingo et al., 2010</a>). However, several in vivo studies carried out up to date have resulted in insufficient evidence to support lethal mutagenesis as a practical approach at the clinical level. In this study, we show that favipiravir, a purine nucleoside analogue, can cause the extinction of an RNA virus during replication in its natural host. The antiviral activity observed in vivo is associated with increased mutation frequencies and, importantly, reduced infectivity in virus samples isolated from the treated animals. These are features typically observed in viral quasispecies approaching extinction during lethal mutagenesis which constitutes a proof-of-principle for this antiviral strategy."

Previous studies on mice and data from clinical trials in humans show that favipiravir is well tolerated in vivo with much less toxicity exhibited than ribavirin (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gowen et al., 2007</a>). In this study, we observed no major side effects in the mice treated during the 8 weeks. The only apparent side-effect is that treated mice show a modest reduced rate of weight gain compared to the control group (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Importantly, favipiravir has shown efficient antiviral activity in mouse models for Ebola virus infections, which has led some African countries to consider using this drug for the control of the current outbreak (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ikuomola, 2014</a>). Further studies are needed to elucidate if the mechanism of action of favipiravir against these other viruses is lethal mutagenesis, and if it constitutes a possible universal antiviral mutagen for the clinical treatment of viral diseases. In particular, an attractive possibility would be to study the effect of favipiravir in the control of HCV, particularly given the lower toxicity displayed by favipiravir."

Due to the absence of cell culture systems to recover and propagate infectious HuNoVs, MNV has been suggested as a potential surrogate system (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wobus et al., 2006</a>). HuNoVs are a significant cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis with large economic losses typically associated with frequent outbreaks in contained environments (&gt;$160 million in UK hospitals alone). In addition, they have been linked to other important disorders such as ulcerative colitis and persistent diarrhoea (<a href=\"#bib49\">Murata et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ludwig et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Khan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Capizzi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bok and Green, 2012</a>). Chronic norovirus infections constitute a major health problem in immunocompromised patients with no treatment yet available (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bok and Green, 2012</a>). Favipiravir or other derivatives with improved pharmacokinetic properties may constitute an attractive candidate for the treatment of these patients. The rapid evolution and large mutation frequencies of norovirus replicating in immunocompromised patients (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bull et al., 2012</a>) suggest that antiviral mutagenesis could be an effective approach. Favipiravir could also be considered as prophylactic treatment to reduce virus dissemination during the course of an outbreak, especially in contained environments such as hospitals or nurseries. The data obtained for persistently infected mice support this possibility with lower virus yields shed by treated animals since an early time during treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

Inhibitors with antiviral activity in vivo have been identified for multiple RNA viruses, including norovirus (<a href=\"#bib56\">Perry et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rocha-Pereira et al., 2013</a>), encouraging further studies in this direction.

These figures show that ribavirin inhibited norovirus replication at early time points, but that favipiravir gradually inhibited replication. The authors argue that this difference indicates that the two compounds act via different mechanism of actions. However, it is alternatively possible that the delayed inhibition shown by favipiravir compared to ribavirin reflects the fact that it takes several more steps to convert favipiravir to the active form compared to ribavirin. For example, favipiravir is predicted to be ribosylated and polyphosphorylated (Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2005 Mar;49(3):981-6) whereas ribavirin only needs to be converted to the triphosphorylated form. Additional experiments would need to be performed to draw conclusions from this data."
