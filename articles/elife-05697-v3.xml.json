In this study, we identify a previously uncharacterised isoform of microtubule-associated protein MAP4, oMAP4, as a microtubule organising factor that is crucial for myogenesis. We show that oMAP4 is expressed upon muscle cell differentiation and is the only MAP4 isoform essential for normal progression of the myogenic differentiation programme. Depletion of oMAP4 impairs cell elongation and cell\u2013cell fusion. Most notably, oMAP4 is required for paraxial microtubule organisation in muscle cells and prevents dynein- and kinesin-driven microtubule\u2013microtubule sliding. Purified oMAP4 aligns dynamic microtubules into antiparallel bundles that withstand motor forces in vitro. We propose a model in which the cooperation of dynein-mediated microtubule transport and oMAP4-mediated zippering of microtubules drives formation of a paraxial microtubule array that provides critical support for the polarisation and elongation of myotubes."

In this study, we identify a previously uncharacterised isoform of microtubule-associated protein MAP4, oMAP4, as a microtubule organising factor that is crucial for myogenesis. We show that oMAP4 is expressed upon muscle cell differentiation and is the only MAP4 isoform essential for normal progression of the myogenic differentiation programme. Depletion of oMAP4 impairs cell elongation and cell\u2013cell fusion. Most notably, oMAP4 is required for paraxial microtubule organisation in muscle cells and prevents dynein- and kinesin-driven microtubule\u2013microtubule sliding. Purified oMAP4 aligns dynamic microtubules into antiparallel bundles that withstand motor forces in vitro. We propose a model in which the cooperation of dynein-mediated microtubule transport and oMAP4-mediated zippering of microtubules drives formation of a paraxial microtubule array that provides critical support for the polarisation and elongation of myotubes."

We identify a previously uncharacterised differentially regulated isoform of microtubule-associated protein MAP4, called oMAP4, as a key organiser of microtubules in differentiating cells. Depletion of oMAP4 results in microtubule misalignment and increased microtubule motility in differentiating muscle cells. This results in defects in myogenic progression, cell polarisation, and cell\u2013cell fusion. We further show that oMAP4 zippers preferentially antiparallel microtubules in vitro and restricts motor-driven microtubule sliding in differentiating muscle cells. Based on our own data, we propose a model whereby the cooperation of motor-driven microtubule\u2013microtubule sliding and oMAP4-mediated zippering organises the microtubule cytoskeleton in differentiating muscle cells to support and govern cell polarisation and differentiation."

As reported previously, we found that microtubule organisation changes from a radial, centrosome-dominated array in undifferentiated cells, to a paraxial array in myotubes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Warren, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tassin et al., 1985</a>). Microtubule growth directionality relative to the longitudinal axis of the cell was determined by tracking EB3-tdTomato-labelled microtubule ends. The asymmetry in the distribution of microtubule growth angles increases significantly during the first two days of differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that guided growth of microtubules (probably along existing microtubules) contributes to the progressively more ordered parallel microtubule array in differentiating cells. Furthermore, microtubules within the array are highly motile in undifferentiated myoblasts as visualised by the photoactivation of paGFP-Tubulin or conversion of mEos2-Tubulin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1, 2</a>). In differentiating muscle cells, microtubules become very stable and static as seen by the low frequency and speed of microtubule-sliding movements and by diminished loss of microtubules from the photoactivated region due to depolymerisation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The reduction in microtubule movements could be due to the differential regulation of motors that drive microtubule sliding. Conventional kinesin as well as dynein has been implicated in microtubule\u2013microtubule sliding and microtubule movement along the cell cortex in other cell systems (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rusan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fink and Steinberg, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Straube et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bicek et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jolly et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Samora et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lu et al., 2013</a>). Both motors contribute to microtubule movements in myoblasts as the frequency of microtubule movements was reduced more than threefold upon depletion of either dynein heavy chain or Kif5b (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4, 5</a>). However, Kif5b and dynein were continuously expressed during muscle differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>), suggesting that other factors prevent motor-dependent microtubule sliding and promote parallel microtubule array formation during myogenesis."

                                "text": "Structural MAPs are candidates for a role in organising parallel microtubule arrays and regulating motor activity. MAP4, the only non-neuronal member of the MAP2/Tau family, has been reported to stabilise and bundle microtubules (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aizawa et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">West et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ookata et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nguyen et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hasan et al., 2006</a>). Our previous finding that MAP4 can limit force generation by dynein motors (<a href=\"#bib48\">Samora et al., 2011</a>) suggested that MAP4 might prevent dynein-driven microtubule motility in muscle cells. Mouse skeletal muscle cells express tissue-specific isoforms of MAP4 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mangan and Olmsted, 1996</a>). To investigate the differential regulation of experimentally confirmed and predicted MAP4 transcripts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), we performed RT-PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from differentiating C2C12 cells. We confirmed the continuous expression of the ubiquitous isoform uMAP4 and upregulation of muscle-specific mMAP4 24 hr post induction of differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Interestingly, we found that a previously uncharacterised isoform, with a unique 48 kD projection domain, was also upregulated after 24 hr of differentiation. In addition to muscle, this isoform is also highly expressed in brain tissue (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We refer to this isoform as oMAP4. Further analysis revealed that uMAP4, mMAP4, and oMAP4 transcripts were each expressed as variants with three, four, or five tau-like microtubule binding repeats due to alternative splicing of exons 14 and 15 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To confirm that these transcripts encode proteins, we generated specific antibodies for mMAP4 and oMAP4 and probed whole cell lysates of C2C12 cells on Western blots. Both mMAP4 and oMAP4 protein levels increase between 24 and 48 hr after differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). As expected, GFP-fusion proteins of uMAP4, mMAP4, and oMAP4 decorated microtubules along their length in C2C12 cells (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

                                "text": "To investigate their involvement in microtubule organisation in muscle cells, we depleted each MAP4 isoform using a vector-based RNA interference approach. GFP-Tubulin was co-expressed with the short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to serve as a marker to detect successful transfection. Efficient depletion was confirmed by Western blotting of FACS-sorted GFP-positive cells and by immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 4, 5</a>). Muscle differentiation phenotypes were assessed as (1) the ability of single nucleated cells to elongate and (2) the efficiency of cells to fuse and form syncytia containing three or more nuclei (<a href=\"#bib52\">Straube and Merdes, 2007</a>). 48 hr after differentiation, the average length of myoblasts treated with control shRNA was 107 \u00b1 40 \u03bcm. Depletion of uMAP4 did not significantly affect this (105 \u00b1 36 \u03bcm, p = 0.4; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). Depletion of mMAP4 allowed myoblasts to elongate to an average length of 143 \u00b1 58 \u03bcm, which is significantly longer than control cells. Myoblast fusion efficiency was not significantly affected following the depletion of uMAP4 or mMAP4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). In contrast, the depletion of oMAP4 caused severe defects in myoblast elongation and fusion. oMAP4-depleted cells had an average length of 82 \u00b1 39 \u03bcm, which is significantly shorter than control myoblasts (p &lt;&lt; 0.001, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). Furthermore, cell\u2013cell fusion efficiency was reduced more than fourfold following depletion of oMAP4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Importantly, co-transfection of an RNAi-resistant version of oMAP4 (FLAG-oMAP4<sup>RIP</sup>) rescued the myoblast elongation and fusion defects caused by oMAP4 shRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The overexpression of uMAP4 was not able to rescue oMAP4-depletion phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Our data collectively demonstrate that oMAP4 is specifically required for morphogenesis and cell\u2013cell fusion during muscle cell differentiation."

                                "text": "To understand which processes in the myogenic programme depend on oMAP4, we analysed the timing of myogenic events. We find a severe delay and reduction in the expression of embryonic myosin, a structural protein required for sarcomere formation, in oMAP4-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). Likewise, the relocation of centrosomal proteins to the nuclear surface of myoblasts, a characteristic event during myogenesis (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tassin et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Srsen et al., 2009</a>), is severely delayed in oMAP4-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). These results confirm that progression through the myogenic differentiation programme depends on oMAP4. Previous work has shown that interference with microtubule stability and the acquisition of posttranslational modifications of tubulin result in similar myogenesis defects (<a href=\"#bib49\">Spencer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). Depletion of oMAP4 did not result in a reduction of tubulin acetylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), perhaps because other microtubule stabilisers were still present. Nevertheless, the microtubule cytoskeleton appeared disorganised in oMAP4-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). To quantitatively assess microtubule network organisation and distinguish this from effects due to different morphology and differentiation status, we selected mono-nucleated elongated myoblasts treated with control and oMAP4 shRNA and manually traced GFP-Tubulin-labelled microtubules in equivalent sections of these cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Videos 6, 7</a>). We found that the microtubule network was largely parallel in control cells with \u223c80% of microtubules oriented \u00b115\u00b0 of the longitudinal cell axis. This was reduced to \u223c50% in oMAP4-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Microtubule orientation was fully rescued by expression of an RNAi-resistant oMAP4 construct (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Depletion of mMAP4 increased paraxial microtubule alignment and uMAP4 depletion slightly reduced it (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We confirmed the microtubule alignment defect caused by oMAP4 depletion results by tracking growing microtubule ends labelled with EB3-tdTomato (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Videos 8, 9</a>). While microtubule growth speed and duration were only slightly affected, the orientation of microtubule growth deviated more from the longitudinal cell axis when oMAP4 was depleted compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J\u2013L</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Alternatively, microtubule sliding and looping as observed in undifferentiated cells could disorganise the microtubule network in oMAP4-depleted cells. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analysed microtubule motility in differentiated, shRNA-treated cells, again selecting elongated, mono-nucleated cells to exclude effects due to morphology alone. As described above, microtubule motility was strongly suppressed in differentiating muscle cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1E\u2013H, 4a</a>). Depletion of oMAP4 resulted in a more than fourfold increase in the frequency of microtubule sliding events, and these were significantly faster than those in control cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). In addition, the rare sliding events in differentiated control cells were usually restricted to movements parallel to the long axis of the cell, while microtubules were observed to loop in oMAP4-depleted cells, similarly to undifferentiated cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1\u20133, 10, 11</a>). These observations suggest that oMAP4 acts to maintain the parallel microtubule network by restricting microtubule movement, especially those that are off-axis."

In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we co-depleted dynein from oMAP4-depleted cells. If oMAP4 would act exclusively through dynein, we posited this should rescue the depletion phenotypes. Depletion of dynein heavy chain alone did not significantly affect the already low-microtubule sliding frequencies in differentiated cells, although the velocity of microtubule sliding was reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>). Cells co-depleted for dynein and oMAP4 still showed a high frequency of microtubule-sliding events (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), although fast sliding events and looping were reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Consequently, dynein co-depletion slightly alleviated the microtubule disorganisation caused by oMAP4 depletion, but did not fully rescue it (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that oMAP4 prevents microtubule sliding by crosslinking microtubules rather than by inhibiting dynein force generation per se. Indeed, expression of GFP-oMAP4 in undifferentiated myoblasts resulted in a significant increase in strong microtubule bundles, while expression of GFP-uMAP4 had no effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>)."

Using in vitro microtubule co-sedimentation assays, we confirmed microtubule-binding activity of the purified proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). When Taxol- or GMP-CPP-stabilised microtubules were incubated with 60-nM oMAP4, we frequently observed microtubule bundles and structures with crossovers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013F</a>). This confirmed that oMAP4 has microtubule cross-linking activity. We next asked whether oMAP4 has the ability to organise dynamic microtubules into antiparallel bundles in vitro. To do this, we used total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy to visualise microtubules assembled from biotinylated microtubule seeds immobilised on streptavidin-coated coverslips. In control chambers, microtubules continued growing without changing direction when they encountered other microtubules and microtubules only overlapped when they happened to grow in the same direction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>, <a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>). The addition of GFP-oMAP4 promoted zippering of those growing microtubules that encountered each other at shallow angles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#media13\">Video 13</a>). To assess whether oMAP4 was specific for the orientation of the microtubules, we determined microtubule polarity based on the growth characteristics of the microtubule ends observed in the video (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and determined the rate of microtubule zippering relative to the incident angle of the two microtubules. No microtubule-zippering events were observed at angles between 25\u00b0 and 150\u00b0, suggesting that oMAP4 can only generate forces to bend microtubules by up to 30\u00b0. Furthermore, oMAP4 showed a strong preference for zippering antiparallel-oriented microtubules (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>)."

                                "text": "Another known antiparallel microtubule-bundling protein, PRC1 is a dimer that accumulates specifically in antiparallel-microtubule overlaps in the spindle midzone (<a href=\"#bib53\">Subramanian et al., 2010</a>). We observed that PRC1 was more potent to bundle-stabilised microtubules free in solution than oMAP4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). However, PRC1 was not able to zipper microtubules in our assays using dynamic microtubules growing from immobilised seeds (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This is in agreement with the literature that described PRC1 to specifically bind to antiparallel-microtubule overlaps that form when microtubules \u2018occasionally encountered each other in a plus end-to-plus end configuration\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bieling et al., 2010</a>) rather than PRC1 itself causing the formation of the overlaps. We do not observe a substantial enrichment of GFP-oMAP4 in antiparallel or parallel overlaps (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). To determine whether the bias in zippering towards antiparallel-oriented microtubules could be due to differences in the length of microtubules that encountered each other, we measured the length dependence of MAP4-mediated zippering. We found similar distributions of microtubule lengths for encounters that resulted in zippering and those encounters that occurred at similarly shallow-incipient angles but not led to zippering (p = 0.22). Likewise, there was no difference between parallel and antiparallel encounters that were zippered (p = 0.59) and those that did not result in zippering (p = 0.88) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, our results demonstrate that oMAP4 is a microtubule-organising factor, which can arrange microtubules into antiparallel and with lesser efficiency parallel bundles. This function is consistent with the depletion phenotypes observed in differentiating muscle cells, where oMAP4 helps to arrange paraxial microtubules and thereby supports cell differentiation."

As we proposed that oMAP4 contributes to microtubule alignment by preventing microtubule sliding in differentiating muscle cells, we next asked how oMAP4-crosslinks microtubules and whether these can withstand motor forces. We considered whether the unique projection domain in oMAP4 confers microtubule cross-linking activity by dimerisation. Proteins of the MAP2/tau family are highly elongated, structurally disordered monomers (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hernandez et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Devred et al., 2004</a>). Using the GOR secondary structure prediction method, we find that oMAP4, uMAP4, and tau share a similar structure of over 60% random coil, about 20% helical, and 13% extended strand (<a href=\"#bib19\">Garnier et al., 1996</a>). Furthermore, no significant coiled-coil domain was predicted. To confirm this, we performed sedimentation analysis of bacterially expressed oMAP4 and GFP-oMAP4 in comparison with a number of standard proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). We obtained sedimentation constants of 3.6 \u00b1 0.25 S and 4.3 \u00b1 0.21 S, respectively. Given the molecular weight of the monomers being 99 kD and 131 kD, respectively, we can calculate the frictional ratio <i>\u0192/\u0192</i><sub>min</sub> = 2.1, suggesting that oMAP4 is a highly elongated monomer with a shape comparable to tau (<i>\u0192/\u0192</i><sub>min</sub> = 1.8, [<a href=\"#bib13\">Devred et al., 2004</a>]). We, therefore, predict that oMAP4 most likely bundles microtubules using a second microtubule-binding region in its projection domain."

To determine whether oMAP4 bundling can indeed withstand the forces exerted by several motors tugging the microtubules apart, we performed gliding assays with kinesin-1. The presence of 80 nM oMAP4 did only slightly affect the velocity of kinesin-mediated movements of single microtubules (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). However, antiparallel-microtubule bundles formed in solution and landing on the kinesin surface were often static or their movement was slow and non-persistent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#media14\">Video 14</a>). Given their predominantly antiparallel arrangement, forces on the microtubules within a bundle would cancel each other out as long as the linkage between the microtubules is maintained. Occasionally, bundles were driven apart. This usually occurred in bundles where extensive lateral forces were generated on one microtubule that was significantly longer than other microtubules in the bundle (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). The antiparallel nature of the oMAP4-generated bundles was confirmed in these cases from the opposing direction of their movement after separation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, magenta arrows). Most importantly, we observed that more than 75% of microtubule bundles withstand motor forces for the entire duration of our 7.5 min videos (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,E,F</a>, yellow arrows), suggesting that oMAP4-mediated cross-linking is indeed able to prevent motor-driven microtubule sliding as we hypothesised."

Microtubules are the stiffest of the cytoskeletal polymers that can bear high-compressive loads, especially when reinforced laterally (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brangwynne et al., 2006</a>). Our data support a model in which microtubules fulfil a structural role during the elongation of muscle cells. If so, one would expect that the degree of alignment of microtubules will correlate with a cell's ability to elongate. We tested this by plotting the Kuiper statistic as a measure of microtubule orderliness against the mean cell length of 48 hr differentiated cells for different RNAi treatments used in this study and found indeed a linear correlation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Likewise, the depletion of mMAP4, which increases the length of differentiating myoblasts also increases the paraxial microtubule alignment beyond that of control cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data support the idea that MT orientation is strongly linked to the morphological changes required for muscle differentiation. As observed for oMAP4, our previously published data on EB3 depletion (<a href=\"#bib52\">Straube and Merdes, 2007</a>) and a number of unpublished observations, myoblasts that fail to elongate are also impaired in cell\u2013cell fusion. While we don't yet understand the relationship between cell elongation and fusion, a mechanism to prevent the fusion of myoblasts that did not complete the previous step of differentiation, makes intuitively sense. oMAP4-depleted cells show in addition to impaired morphological changes, also a delay in the expression of myogenic markers, such as myogenin and embryonic myosin, further suggesting that a signalling step in the differentiation programme has not been completed. Microtubules have been implicated in a signalling role during myogenesis based on the observation that altering the level of posttranslational tubulin modifications either through chemical inhibition or depletion of microtubule-stabilising MAPs leads to similar delays in the expression of differentiation markers and impaired formation of myotubes (<a href=\"#bib49\">Spencer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). The depletion of oMAP4 does not negatively affect tubulin acetylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) but might impact other aspects of this putative microtubule-dependent signalling event. It will be a future challenge to elucidate the pathway that couples microtubule organisation and chemical modification to the timing of the myogenic protein expression programme."

                        "text": "We show that oMAP4 and PRC1 are both microtubule-bundling proteins, but with very different properties. While PRC1 is an antiparallel dimer that forms ordered crosslinks of a defined distance and specifically enriches in antiparallel-microtubule overlaps (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bieling et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Subramanian et al., 2010</a>), oMAP4 has little preference for binding to bundles, but instead is able to zipper microtubules. Zippering of microtubules growing from surface-attached seeds requires bending of microtubules. We consider that the lateral forces required to bring two microtubules close together against the rigidity of the microtubule have to be borne by a single crosslinking molecule. Thus, our data suggest that single molecules of oMAP4 can resist higher loads than PRC1 crosslinks. When we apply longitudinal forces as experienced by pre-formed bundles in kinesin-gliding assays, the shear forces are probably shared between several crosslinking molecules, thus enabling oMAP4 to withstand counteracting motor forces on the bundled microtubules. Bundles that contain one very long microtubule that is driven laterally on the kinesin surface, eventually splay apart as lateral forces cannot be shared between the crosslinkers. In contrast, PRC1 cannot resist motor forces and at moderate levels only slightly slows motor-driven sliding of microtubules (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bieling et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Subramanian et al., 2010</a>). Thus, oMAP4 has the required properties to fulfil the role of a microtubule organiser, justifying its name as organising MAP4, although the structural basis for oMAP4's antiparallel zippering remains to be elucidated."

                        "text": "The motors dynein and kinesin move microtubules and cause apparent disorder that is limited by oMAP4 crosslinking. However, both motors have also been reported to bundle and organise microtubules. Indeed, dynein depletion alone results in reduced microtubule alignment (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is consistent with the finding that dynein controls muscle length in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Folker et al., 2012</a>) and earlier reports of dynein involvement in the self-organisation of microtubule networks and its ability to crosslink and slide antiparallel microtubules as well as transporting microtubules along the cell cortex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Heald et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adames and Cooper, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Merdes et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fink and Steinberg, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Samora et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tanenbaum et al., 2013</a>). As oMAP4 is only able to efficiently zipper microtubules at incident angles of less than 30\u00b0 if antiparallel and less than 10\u00b0 if parallel, we propose that dynein-mediated looping and buckling of microtubules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fink and Steinberg, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tanenbaum et al., 2013</a>) brings microtubules into a favourable position for oMAP4-mediated zippering. As oMAP4-mediated bundling resists motor-driven sliding, dynein can only move those microtubules that are not yet aligned to the paraxial network. Thus, dynein and oMAP4 are likely to cooperate in the formation of the highly ordered microtubule arrangement in differentiating muscle cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). In the absence of oMAP4, excessive motor-driven microtubule motility disorganises microtubules. In the absence of dynein, oMAP4 might stabilise high-angle microtubule crossovers, but will not be able to align them into the network. If the activity of both oMAP4 and dynein is reduced, oMAP4 zippering is missing and kinesin-mediated sliding and bundling (<a href=\"#bib51\">Straube et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jolly et al., 2010</a>) prevails (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). In agreement with this model, some disorganisation of microtubules has been observed in kinesin-1-depleted myotubes (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wilson and Holzbaur, 2012</a>). Microtubule\u2013microtubule sliding has recently been implicated in driving neurite outgrowth (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lu et al., 2013</a>), and paraxial microtubule arrangements have been shown to drive dorsal closure during embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jankovics and Brunner, 2006</a>). Thus, the mechanisms we reveal here for motor and MAP cooperation in the formation of paraxial microtubule networks are likely to be of importance beyond muscle cells. Indeed, oMAP4 is highly expressed in brain (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that it might be required to support the paraxial microtubule arrays in dendrites and the axon."

                        "text": "While the zippering model described above explains how a paraxial array is maintained in the presence of microtubule turnover, it does not explain how the symmetry of the radial microtubule cytoskeleton in the myoblast is broken in the first place. We think that a bipolar elongating myoblast can be compared to a migrating cell with two fronts. Symmetry breaking in cell migration occurs through protrusion mediated by the actin cytoskeleton. Microtubules support and stabilise cell protrusions, and microtubule plus ends are selectively stabilised at the leading edge (<a href=\"#bib61\">Waterman-Storer et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kaverina and Straube, 2011</a>). This establishes and reinforces the new polarity axis. Similarly, in differentiating myoblasts dynamic capture of microtubule plus ends occurs at the cell tips (<a href=\"#bib52\">Straube and Merdes, 2007</a>). This leads to the selective stabilisation of paraxial microtubules to break the symmetry in the microtubule network. The zippering mechanism described here would promote shorter microtubules to align to longer and already bundled microtubules and thus amplify the directional bias and increase stability and orderliness in the paraxial array. It is likely that the guidance of microtubule growth through the cooperation of plus end tracking proteins and motors also contributes to maintenance of the ordered array (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mattie et al., 2010</a>). It will be interesting to dissect the contributions of these different pathways to microtubule network reorganisation, not only at the onset of myogenesis, but also during later stages when the parallel network is replaced by the grid-like lattice found in adult muscle (<a href=\"#bib41\">Oddoux et al., 2013</a>)."

For all analysis of microtubule phenotypes, mono-nucleated, elongated cells were selected. For analyses of microtubule dynamics during myoblast differentiation, fluorescence images of EB3-tdTomato were acquired with 500 ms exposure at a temporal resolution of 3 s for 120 s. EB comets were tracked using plusTipTracker and further analysed for microtubule directionality using custom MATLAB code (see supplementary file MTdirectionality.m). For microtubule motility experiments, cells were transiently transfected with pSuper-mEOS2-Tubulin plasmids or co-transfected with paGFP-Tubulin and pSuper-mCherry-Tubulin plasmids. The microtubule cytoskeleton was focussed and bar-shaped regions of interest perpendicular to the microtubule network were selected using the non-converted mEOS2-Tubulin or mCherry-Tubulin signal. After photoactivation or photoconversion of these regions of interest using 10% 406 nm with the Deltavision photokinetics module laser power, images were acquired with 500 ms exposure at a temporal resolution of 1.6 s per frame for 60 s or lower temporal resolution for up to 6 min. Images were deconvolved with low noise filtering method for 10 iterations using SoftWorx (Applied Precision, LLC). Microtubule motility events were scored when an activated fragment moved for more than 0.5 \u03bcm from its original location. The velocity of microtubule movements was determined as the average velocity during each motility event, which lasted on average 15\u201320 s. Directionality of microtubule motility was scored as paraxial if within 45\u00b0 of the long axis of the cell. Looping microtubules were defined as those that underwent a directional change of more than 90\u00b0 during the movement event. For analysis of the contribution of microtubule dynamics and motor-driven microtubule movement to microtubule loss from photoactivated regions, undifferentiated or 48 hr differentiated C2C12 cells expressing mEOS2-Tubulin were treated with either 10 \u03bcM Taxol (to suppress MT depolymerisation) or 5 mM azide in 1 mM 2-deoxyglucose (to suppress motor activity) or a mixture of Taxol and azide (as a control for photobleaching) for 30 min before imaging. Signal intensity of photoconverted regions at each time point recorded using ImageJ. After background subtraction, photobleaching correction and normalisation of fluorescence intensity, the half-life of signal dissipation was determined by fitting a single exponential curve to the fluorescence intensity data over time."

Filaments were manually traced using ImageJ and deviation from the longitudinal cell axis calculated in MATLAB. To determine the number of bundles per cell, undifferentiated C2C12 cells were transiently transfected with either GFP-oMAP4 or GFP-uMAP4, fixed after 24 hr and stained with tubulin antibodies. Bundles were scored when elongated regions of more than 2.3-\u03bcm length had an intensity of more than threefold of a single microtubule. Superresolution images of microtubules labelled with anti-tubulin and Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies and embedded in ProLong Gold reagent (Molecular Probes) were obtained on a N-SIM system (Nikon, Japan) at The Babraham Institute using 3D SIM mode with 15 individual images collected for reconstruction."

Microtubule gliding speeds were determined from tracks obtained using ImageJ plugin MTrackJ. Microtubule encounters were classified as zippering when they resulted in bundling for a minimum length of 2 \u03bcm away from the initial point of contact. For parallel bundling, zippering would need to occur towards the minus end of both microtubules. For antiparallel zippering, both aligned microtubule ends would need to continue growth for at least 2 \u03bcm along the lattice of the other microtubule. Microtubule lengths were measured to address whether the bias in microtubule zippering by oMAP4 arises from differences in lengths between parallel and antiparallel microtubules. For microtubule encounters in either orientation that resulted in successful zippering, distance from the point of encounter to the microtubule seed or to the next microtubule crossover point was measured. Microtubule lengths were measured similarly for unsuccessful encounters but these were restricted to shallow angle encounters at which oMAP4-mediated zippering typically occurs, that is, 10\u00b0\u201330\u00b0."

To test binding of MAP4 proteins to microtubules, 1.5 \u03bcM of Taxol-stabilised microtubules was mixed with purified 60 nM oMAP4 in the presence of 20 \u03bcM Paclitaxel in BRB80 in a total volume of 50 \u03bcl. Reactions were then incubated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C and centrifuged at 35\u00b0C, 50,000 RPM for 15 min. After recovery of the supernatant, the pellet was washed with and then resuspended in 50 \u03bcl BRB80 and 20 \u03bcM Paclitaxel. After addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, pellet and supernatant fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE. For microtubule bundling experiments, 40 \u03bcl drops of 0.1 mg/ml Poly-L-Lysine (Sigma) were placed onto 70% ethanol washed and air-dried 22 \u00d7 22 mm glass coverslips (Menzel-Gl\u00e4ser, Germany). After removal of the Poly-L-Lysine solution using a bench top coverslip centrifuge (Technical Video Ltd., Port Townsend, WA), coverslips were rinsed three times with 150 \u03bcl ddH<sub>2</sub>O using the same procedure and air dried. To test if oMAP4 can bundle microtubules, Rhodamine-labelled microtubule seeds stabilised with GMP-CPP or Taxol-stabilised microtubules were mixed in BRB80 in a total volume of 10 \u03bcl and incubated with buffer or with 60 nM oMAP4 at 22\u00b0C for 10\u201315 min. 1 \u03bcl samples of reactions were then placed onto slides, mounted with Poly-L-Lysine coated coverslips, and imaged using the Deltavision widefield system as above. For comparative analysis of EB1-, PRC1-, and oMAP4-mediated bundling, freshly polymerised GMPCPP-stabilised Hilyte647-labelled microtubules were incubated with 80 nM protein in MRB80 for 10 min before loading into a 10 \u03bcm flow chamber made from a slide and a poly-lysine-coated coverslip. At least 30 random fields were imaged using TIRF microscopy at critical angle. Bundles were counted if at least three times as bright as single microtubules."

The negative control would be a protein that does not create microtubule bundles (for example, kinesin-1 motor domain, EB1 or another microtubule-binding protein which does not function as a microtubule-bundling factor in cells). This would be used to exclude artifactual sources of bundling in the assay (e.g., protein misfolding). The positive control would be an established microtubule bundler, such as PRC1. A comparison with an established anti-parallel bundler is important because the provided data do not conclusively prove that oMAP4 a \u201ctrue\u201d antiparallel bundler (a protein, whose structure dictates a preference for binding to antiparallel microtubule overlaps). The alternative is that oMAP4 creates randomly-oriented bundles with microtubules pointing in both directions. Such bundles would also resist gliding by kinesin motors and splay apart, as shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. To create a random bundle, oMAP4 would need to zipper both parallel and antiparallel overlaps. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> shows that zippering occurs with higher frequency when the microtubules grow towards each other at \u223c180 degrees. This higher frequency is the only evidence that oMAP4 has a structural preference for antiparallel overlaps.

In this context a positive control would be very useful. What does <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> look like for PRC1, for example?

As proteins are not subject to modifications when expressed recombinantly in bacteria and MAP4 could be subject to different modifications when expressed exogenously in HeLa cells, the observed differences are likely caused by posttranslational modifications. MAP4 is known to be subject to phosphorylation (Semenova et al., Mol Biol Cell 2014) and all MAP4 isoforms as well as other structural MAPs run well above their molecular weight on SDS-PAGE: uMAP4 (West et al., J Biol Chem 1991), mMAP4 (Mangan et al., Development 1996) and other structural MAPs (Noble et al., J Cell Biol 1989; Lee et al., Science 1988; Irminger-Finger et al., J Cell Biol. 1990). We have confirmed the identity of the purified protein using mass spectroscopy, peptides found covered 77% of the proteins with no substantial gaps.

As in many biological processes, imbalance probably causes the biggest problems and the removal of dynein that is responsible for looping movements and the crosslinker oMAP4 that prevents this, probably allows room for other proteins with crosslinking activity such as kinesin-1 and other organising activities such as guided microtubule assembly to dominate.
