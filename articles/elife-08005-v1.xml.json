Normally, the cells in these tumors do not self-destruct. Levi-Ferber et al. exposed tumor cells from the worms to chemicals or to genetic modifications that cause unfolded proteins to accumulate inside the cell. This build-up of proteins stresses a structure in the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum. Normally, if endoplasmic reticulum stress gets too high, the cell activates various pathways to relieve the stress, and if these fail, the cell self-destructs."

Consequently, GLD-1 regulates many aspects of germ cell biology (<a href=\"#bib8\">Francis et al., 1995a</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">1995b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kadyk and Kimble, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hansen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Ciosk et al., 2006</a>). One of the striking consequence of a deficiency in <i>gld-1</i> is the formation of a proximal germline tumor that fills the gonad (<a href=\"#bib8\">Francis et al., 1995a</a>). This germline tumor is the result of re-entry of meiotic germ cells into the mitotic cell cycle instead of maturing into oocytes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Francis et al., 1995a</a>). Importantly, some aspects of tumorigenesis are exhibited in the <i>gld-1</i> germline tumor model. These include the ability of the tumorous germ cells to proliferate in a growth factor\u2013independent manner (<a href=\"#bib8\">Francis et al., 1995a</a>) and their regulation by genes homologous to known human oncogenes or human tumor suppressor genes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Pinkston-Gosse and Kenyon, 2007</a>). Notably, these tumorous germ cells acquired resistance to apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gumienny et al., 1999</a>). In addition, some precocious germ cell transdifferentiation into ectopic somatic cells has been reported to occur at a low frequency in <i>gld-1</i>-deficient animal (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ciosk et al., 2006</a>). This transdifferentiation of the germ cells can be further enhanced by manipulation of RNA binding proteins, P granule components, transcription factors and histone modifiers; all of which regulate gene expression within the transdifferentiating germ cells themselves (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ciosk et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Tursun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Patel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Updike et al., 2014</a>). In this study, we investigated whether cellular and organismal stress can affect germ cell fate and tumorigenicity in the <i>gld-1</i> tumor model."

Nevertheless, the germ cells in <i>gld-1</i>-deficient animals were reported to be resistant to physiological and DNA damage-induced apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gumienny et al., 1999</a>), suggesting that they may have acquired global resistance to apoptosis promoting signals, a common phenomenon of transformed cells. To directly test whether ER stress succeeds or fails to induce apoptosis in <i>gld-1</i>-deficient animals, we exposed the animals to ER stress, and assessed the presence of apoptotic corpses within the gonad using the SYTO12 apoptotic dye. ER stress was induced either by treating the animals with tunicamycin (a specific inhibitor of N-glycosylation) or by treating the animals with <i>tfg-1</i> RNAi (<i>tfg-1</i> encodes a component of COPII-coated vesicles required for the export of cargo from the ER [<a href=\"#bib39\">Witte et al., 2011</a>]). Both treatments specifically induce ER stress (<a href=\"#bib23\">Levi-Ferber et al., 2014</a>). As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gumienny et al., 1999</a>), no apoptotic corpses representing physiological germ cell apoptosis were detected in the tumorous gonads in the absence of ER stress (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

First, in terms of location within the gonad\u2014whereas in non-tumorous gonads apoptotic germ cell corpses were usually detected at the turn of the gonad, where oogenesis occurs, those detected in ER-stressed tumorous gonads were located in the proximal region of the gonad (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,D</a>). In addition, in terms of size, both the SYTO12-labeled nuclei and the CED-1::GFP-engulfed cells in the tumorous gonads exposed to ER stress were significantly larger than those detected in non-tumorous animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C,D,E</a>). Furthermore, unlike engulfed germ cell corpses that are typically round, the CED-1::GFP engulfed cells in the ER-stressed tumorous gonads displayed a variety of shapes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

To this end, <i>ced-3</i> expression was inactivated to prevent apoptosis and the pattern of the nuclei in the gonad was assessed by DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole\u200e) staining. Strikingly, blocking apoptosis resulted in the accumulation of cells with large and misshaped nuclei occupying nearly 40% of the stressed gonad (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Even without exposing the animals to ER stress, blocking apoptosis resulted in the accumulation of ectopic cells with large and misshaped nuclei in the gonads of the <i>gld-1</i> RNAi-treated animals. However, in the absence of ER stress, the abnormally large nuclei occupied only 10% of the gonad (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), indicating that ER stress promotes their induction. Interestingly, blocking apoptosis enabled the detection of ectopic cells within the gonads of nearly 90% of the <i>gld-1</i> RNAi-treated animals examined, both under normal growth conditions as well as under ER stress, albeit to different extents (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). The enhanced accumulation of ectopic cells in the ER stressed gonads was not due to altered efficiency of the <i>gld-1</i> RNAi as the GLD-1 protein levels were similarly reduced upon <i>gld-1</i> RNAi treatment in combination with control/<i>tfg-1</i> and <i>ced-3</i> RNAi (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, treatment of <i>gld-1(q485); ced-3(n1286)</i> double mutants with ER-stress inducing <i>tfg-1</i> RNAi also increased the accumulation of cells with large nuclei in the gonads (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), recapitulating the phenomena observed in <i>gld-1, tfg-1</i> and <i>ced-3</i> RNAi-treated animals. Altogether, these findings suggest that these cells with large nuclei in the gonads of <i>gld-1</i>-deficient animals are the ones that are normally cleared from the gonad by apoptosis, and not the typical germ cells."

In addition, Hoechst-nuclei staining of a strain expressing the neuronal <i>Punc-119::gfp</i> somatic marker was used to assess whether the pattern of the ectopic somatic cells in the gonad overlapped with the cells harboring small germline-like nuclei or whether it overlapped with the ectopically large nuclei.

Thus, we explored whether the ectopic somatic cells in the gonad of ER stressed-animals are derived from germ cells as well. To this end, we treated animals with a normal germline or <i>glp-1(lof)</i> mutants, whose primary germ cells do not proliferate at non permissive temperatures, with a mixture of <i>gld-1, tfg-1</i> and <i>ced-3</i> RNAi, in order to generate optimal conditions for the detection of ectopic somatic cells in the gonad (RNAi efficacy was confirmed as described in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

Ectopic somatic cells were not detected in the gonad of germ cell-deficient <i>glp-1</i> animals, although they were detected in control germ cell (+) animals upon induction of ER stress (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These findings are consistent with the possibility that the ectopic somatic cells induced by ER stress in the tumorous gonad are derived from the germ cells themselves, uncovering ER stress as a potent regulator of germ cell pluripotency. Importantly, unlike previously identified regulators of germ cell pluripotency, all of which act at the final steps of the transdifferentiation process by directly regulating gene expression (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ciosk et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Tursun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Patel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Updike et al., 2014</a>); ER stress and ER homeostasis likely act further upstream, linking between cellular and organismal physiology and germ cell fate."

We hypothesized that if <i>ire-1</i> promotes germ cell transdifferentiation by activating the transcription factor <i>xbp-1</i>, then ER stress would fail to induce germ cell transdifferentiation in <i>xbp-1</i>-deficient animals. Initially, we used DAPI staining to assess the levels of germ cell transdifferentiation in two strains deficient in <i>xbp-1- xbp-1(zc12) and xbp-1(tm2457)</i>. Strikingly, we detected significantly increased levels of ectopic nuclei in the gonads of both <i>xbp-1</i> mutants upon treatment with a mixture of <i>gld-1</i> and <i>ced-3</i> RNAi on day 4 of adulthood (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Previous studies in mice and in <i>C. elegans xbp-1(zc12)</i> mutants have demonstrated that the mere deficiency in XBP1 leads to activation of the ER stress sensor IRE1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Richardson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hur et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Safra et al., 2013</a>) Thus, we hypothesized that this high basal level of germ cell transdifferentiation in <i>xbp-1</i> mutants may be due to the increased activity of IRE-1 in these mutants. Consistent with this interpretation, the high level of germ cell transdifferentiation in <i>xbp-1</i> mutants was completely dependent on <i>ire-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, although ER stress-induced germ cell transdifferentiation is completely dependent on the ER stress sensor gene <i>ire-1</i>, it is not dependent on its downstream target <i>xbp-1</i>, implying that it is mediated by an <i>ire-1-</i>dependent <i>xbp-1</i>-independent signal."

To this end, we analyzed the progression of the germline tumor in <i>gld-1</i>-deficient animals in the presence or absence of ER stress. We found that <i>xbp-1</i> inactivation, not only induced germ cell transdifferentiation but also suppressed the germline tumor; demonstrating that the two phenomena are tightly correlated. The physiological improvement was manifested in several ways: (a) the density of the germ cells in the germline tumor was reduced in the tumorous animals exposed to ER stress such that the germline tumor that occupied the proximal gonad did not fill the entire gonad (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). (b) as the germline tumor progresses, the gonad becomes over-packed with proliferating germ cells, resulting in increased rigidity of the gonad. Consequently, the motion of animals with a packed gonad germline tumor is limited resulting in paralyzed animals that can move their heads but cannot move their body. We find that ER stress significantly delayed the paralysis of the tumorous animals and allowed the animals to move freely at time-points where most of the non-stressed tumorous animals were paralyzed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1, 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014Figure supplement 1A</a>). This implies that the gonad of the animals subjected to ER stress were not as packed with germ cells as the non-stressed animals. (c) as the germline tumor progresses it ultimately kills the animal. We found that in wild-type animals, treatment with <i>gld-1</i> RNAi shortened the lifespan by more than 30%, whereas it shortened the lifespan of ER stressed-<i>xbp-1</i> mutants by only 13% (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Similarly, treatment with <i>gld-1</i> RNAi shortened wild-type animals lifespan by more than 30%, whereas it shortened the lifespan of <i>tfg-1</i> RNAi-treated animals by only 15% (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Importantly, no physiological improvement in terms of lifespan, movement or germline density were observed in <i>ire-1</i> deficient animals, in which ER stress-induced germ cell transdifferentiation does not occur, even upon <i>xbp-1</i> inactivation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

                                "text": "DNA damage, pathogens, oxidative, osmotic, heat shock, starvation and ER stress are all known inducers of germ cell apoptosis in normal (i.e., non-tumorous) germlines (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gartner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Salinas et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Levi-Ferber et al., 2014</a>). We wondered whether such stresses that induce germ cell apoptosis in non-tumorous gonads would induce germ cell transdifferentiation in <i>gld-1</i>-deficient animals, similarly to ER stress. To address this, wild-type or <i>gld-1</i>-deficient animals were exposed to ER stress, genotoxic stress, mitochondrial stress or osmotic stress. These stresses were induced by manipulating genes whose inactivation is known to induce only one specific stress response, without globally stressing the animals. <i>tfg-1</i> RNAi was used to activate the ER stress response (<a href=\"#bib23\">Levi-Ferber et al., 2014</a>). <i>rad-51</i> RNAi, which targets a DNA recombinase required for the repair of dsDNA breaks was used for the induction of genotoxic stress (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gartner et al., 2000</a>). Mitochondrial stress was induced by RNAi targeting <i>ddl-3</i>, which encodes a kinesin light chain whose inactivation specifically activates the mitochondrial stress response (<a href=\"#bib34\">Shore et al., 2012</a>). Osmotic stress was induced by inactivation of a negative regulator of the osmotic stress response, <i>osm-8</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rohlfing et al., 2011</a>). We confirmed that all of these treatments significantly increased the amount of apoptotic corpses in the gonads of animals with a non-tumorous germline (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and white bar graph). We found that although some treatments induced more germ cell apoptosis than <i>tfg-1</i> RNAi, only treatment with <i>tfg-1</i> RNAi led to the detection of cells with large nuclei in the gonads of <i>gld-1; ced-3</i>-deficient animals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and black bar graphs). Thus, although ER stress induces germ cell apoptosis in normal gonads and hinders germ cell pluripotency in <i>gld-1</i>-deficient animals, the latter does not occur upon exposure to other severe cellular stresses, including genotoxic stress. This indicates that the transdifferentiation of the germ cells is not simply a side-effect or a default fate of apoptosis-resistant tumorous cells under proapoptotic stress which they fail to execute. Moreover, since only treatment with <i>tfg-1</i> RNAi suppressed the progression of the germline tumor (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), this lends further support to the notion that induction of germ cell transdifferentiation is a prerequisite for the suppression of the germline tumor."

Inactivation of the <i>gld-1</i> genes alters many aspects of germ cell fate: differentiation of germ cells into oocytes is abrogated, germ cell proliferation is enhanced, a germline tumor is formed and the germ cells lose their responsiveness to execute physiological and stress-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, in <i>gld-1</i> deficient animals the germ cells are prone to generate teratoma as they become sensitized to precociously transdifferentiate into somatic cells. Under these conditions ER stress can suppress and limit the germline tumor. This suppression is achieved by enhancing germline transdifferentiation into ectopic somatic cells. Soon after the transdifferentiation, these ectopic cells undergo apoptosis, and are removed from the gonad, suppressing the germline tumor."

This suggests that the regulation of these processes in <i>gld-1</i>-deficient animals is specifically associated with ER stress, and is not simply a side-effect of apoptosis-resistant cells under stress. How might ER stress promote germ cell transdifferentiation? A major consequence of ER stress is interference with ER functions, which may directly impinge upon the production of a variety of signaling molecules such as secreted peptides, hormones, cholesterol and lipids which are metabolized in the ER. However, it is unlikely that this directly accounts for ER stress-induced germline transdifferentiation and apoptosis of the germ cells as these do not occur in animals under severe ER stress in the absence of <i>ire-1</i>. This suggests that it is the activation of the ER stress sensor IRE-1, rather than a non-specific consequence of ER stress per se, that regulate germ cell pro-differentiation and tumor progression in <i>gld-1</i>-deficient animals. Furthermore, since germ-cell transdifferentiation is promoted in animal deficient in <i>xbp-1</i>, this indicates that it is mediated by an <i>ire-1-</i>dependent <i>xbp-1</i> independent signal. What are the signaling molecules produced? Is it a single molecule or an arsenal of signaling molecules that regulate germ cell fate? These are all open questions to be addressed in future studies. Interestingly, in humans, mutations that compromise the activity or the expression of RNase L, an IRE1-related endoribonuclease, have been implicated with increased susceptibility to prostate cancer (<a href=\"#bib3\">Carpten et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Casey et al., 2002</a>). Unlike IRE1, RNase L has lost specificity to <i>xbp-1</i> mRNA. Nevertheless, it shares with IRE-1 its promiscuous RNase activity. This similarity may be sufficient as the tumor-suppressive properties of <i>ire-1</i> described herein are independent of <i>xbp-1</i>. This implies that tumor-suppressive properties of IRE-1-related endoribonucleases may be evolutionarily conserved, and may not be specifically associated with one specific type of prostate cancer."

Thus, transformation into an ectopic kind of cell, rather than differentiation into a type of cell which can normally be found in the same primary niche, may have an added value in suppressing aggressive tumors. Strikingly, in 95% of human ovarian germline tumors, the totipotent germ cells precociously differentiate into a variety of ectopic somatic cells generating teratoma (<a href=\"#bib22\">Koonings et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ulbright, 2005</a>). These naturally occurring teratoma are usually benign whereas the remaining 5% are usually malignant (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ulbright, 2005</a>). This suggests that teratoma may be a preferential germline tumor in terms of survival and fitness of the organism. As in other tumor-suppressive mechanisms, cancer cells may evolve to bypass this line of defense. Accordingly, some of the ovarian teratoma undergo a malignant transformation which occurs after the development of the teratoma. Nevertheless, this occurs only in 1.5% of teratoma (<a href=\"#bib6\">Comerci et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ayhan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ulbright, 2005</a>). This suggests that the conclusions derived from our studies in the <i>C. elegans</i> tumor model system are already naturally applied for human germline tumor biology, as if they were selected to do so by evolution."

This raises the question whether transdifferentiation-mediated tumor suppression is relevant only for germline tumors, or is it relevant to a wider range of cell types? In mammals, in addition to the totipotent germ cells, subpopulations of stem cells, which maintain differentiation potential (i.e., pluri or multi-potent) exist in many organs and tissues, albeit at low numbers (<a href=\"#bib26\">Reya et al., 2001</a>). Furthermore, within tumors and hematological cancers, one can find a subpopulation of cancer stem cells that possess stem cells characteristics, including the ability to give rise to a variety of cell types (<a href=\"#bib26\">Reya et al., 2001</a>). Accordingly, differentiation therapy has been used in the clinic and is proven to be effective in limiting some kinds of tumors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Sell, 2004</a>). Interestingly, whereas these treatments induce differentiation of cells within the same lineage, induction of transdifferentiation into a completely different cellular lineage may be even more effective by creating a discrepancy and maladaptiveness between the tumorous cells and their surrounding niche. Thus, induction of tumor cell transdifferentiation has the potential to be applied as a novel approach to combat cancer and overcome the escape of tumor cells from the cell death machinery in a wide variety of tissues."

To support the claim made in the Abstract, it would be important to present evidence that manipulations that lead to ER stress indeed suppress tumor formation (and not merely lead to trans differentiation, as is presently shown). The interest of the observations would not be diminished were it to turn out that elimination of <i>xbp-1</i> is a pre-requisite to tumor suppression; for example if compromising <i>tfg-1</i> by RNAi further suppresses tumors of <i>gld-1</i> deficient worms in an <i>ire-1</i> dependent manner only when <i>xbp-1</i> is also missing, but the Title, Abstract and Discussion would need to accommodate such a finding."

Your case for an <i>ire-1</i> mediated tumor suppression mechanism in worms would be strengthened by evidence that something similar is going on in the <i>xbp-1</i> deficient worms; if this is experimentally unfeasible it remains an important discussion point. RNaseL, an IRE-1 descendent (evolutionarily-speaking), which has retained its promiscuous RNase activity but has lost specificity to XBP1, has been implicated in tumor suppression in mammals (PMID: 11799394 and 12415269). These facts stand to inform the discussion of your findings. More broadly, the three reviewers of your paper feel that it might be improved if its thrust were to be shifted from the role of ER unfolded protein stress in trans differentiation and tumor suppression to a role for <i>ire-1</i> (hyper) activity in these processes."

Left there, this would subject to many different interpretations. But what makes their findings potentially interesting is the observation that such stress-induced trans-differentiation is dependent on IRE-1 signaling but is independent of IRE-1's main known effector XBP1. In fact, inactivation of XBP1 on its own promotes such salutary trans-differentiation of the \u201ctumorous\u201d germ cells in <i>gld-1</i> deficient worms. These observations argue against trans-differentiation reflecting a non-specific feature of mounting levels of ER stress and rather suggest that some aspect of IRE-1 signaling that is independent of XBP1 sets up this anti-tumour defense mechanism. The echoes to RNaseL, which is a derivative of IRE-1 with tumour suppressive properties, are interesting."
