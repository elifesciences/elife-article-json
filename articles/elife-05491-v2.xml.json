Although cell surface cues play a major role in this process, few dendrite specific signals have been identified to date. We conducted an in vivo RNAi screen in <i>Drosophila</i> class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons and identified the conserved Ret receptor, known to play a role in axon guidance, as an important regulator of dendrite development. The loss of <i>Ret</i> results in severe dendrite defects due to loss of extracellular matrix adhesion, thus impairing growth within a 2D plane. We provide evidence that <i>Ret</i> interacts with integrins to regulate dendrite adhesion via <i>rac1</i>. In addition, Ret is required for dendrite stability and normal F-actin distribution suggesting it has an essential role in dendrite maintenance. We propose novel functions for Ret as a regulator in dendrite patterning and adhesion distinct from its role in axon guidance."

Although cell surface cues play a major role in this process, few dendrite specific signals have been identified to date. We conducted an in vivo RNAi screen in <i>Drosophila</i> class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons and identified the conserved Ret receptor, known to play a role in axon guidance, as an important regulator of dendrite development. The loss of <i>Ret</i> results in severe dendrite defects due to loss of extracellular matrix adhesion, thus impairing growth within a 2D plane. We provide evidence that <i>Ret</i> interacts with integrins to regulate dendrite adhesion via <i>rac1</i>. In addition, Ret is required for dendrite stability and normal F-actin distribution suggesting it has an essential role in dendrite maintenance. We propose novel functions for Ret as a regulator in dendrite patterning and adhesion distinct from its role in axon guidance."

Thus, coordinated dendrite growth and patterning is important for establishing the often complex, but highly stereotyped organization of receptive fields. Two of the organizing principles in dendrite development are self-avoidance and tiling (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grueber and Sagasti, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jan and Jan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zipursky and Sanes, 2010</a>). While self-avoidance describes the phenomenon of recognition and repulsion of isoneuronal dendritic branches, tiling refers to the complete yet non-redundant coverage of a receptive field by neighboring neurons of the same type. Both phenomena have been described in different systems across species including the mouse, zebrafish, medicinal leech, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, and <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>."

Many such receptors, prominently Robo (<a href=\"#bib59\">Spitzweck et al., 2010</a>) and Ephrin receptors (<a href=\"#bib14\">Egea and Klein, 2007</a>), have well understood roles in axon guidance. Although some of these axonal cues including Robo/Slit play a role in dendrite development as well (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dimitrova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gibson et al., 2014</a>), dendritic surface receptors and their functions are not fully characterized to date. Recent efforts have yielded some progress in this area. <i>Down's syndrome cell adhesion molecule</i> (<i>Dscam</i>) has been shown to regulate dendrite self-avoidance in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hughes et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Matthews et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Soba et al., 2007</a>) and mouse (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fuerst et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2009</a>). More recently, studies on protocadherins have revealed that they play an important role in dendrite self-avoidance in mammals (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lefebvre et al., 2012</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i>, sax-7/L1-CAM and menorin (mnr-1) form a defined pattern in the surrounding hypodermal tissue to guide PVD sensory neuron dendrite growth via the neuronal receptor dma-1 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Salzberg et al., 2013</a>).

The larval PNS contains segmentally repeated dendritic arborization (da) neurons which have been classified as class I\u2013IV according to their increasing dendritic complexity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grueber et al., 2002</a>). All da neuron classes feature highly stereotyped sensory dendrite projections. Moreover, all da neurons exhibit self-avoidance behavior allowing them to develop their individual receptive fields without overlap. It has been demonstrated that all da neuron classes require <i>Dscam</i> for dendrite self-avoidance (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hughes et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Matthews et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Soba et al., 2007</a>).

For tiling, no surface receptor has been identified to date. However, the conserved <i>hippo and tricornered</i> kinases, and more recently the <i>torc2</i> complex, have been implicated in C4da neuron tiling, as the loss of function of these genes results in iso- and heteroneuronal crossing of dendrites (<a href=\"#bib15\">Emoto et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Koike-Kumagai et al., 2009</a>)."

Thus, they can avoid dendrites by growing into the epidermis leading to 3D crossing of iso- and hetero-neuronal branches (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). Integrins are therefore essential to ensure repulsion-mediated self-avoidance and tiling mechanisms, which restrict growth of dendrites competing for the same territory (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). How integrins are recruited to dendrite adhesion sites and whether they cooperate with other cell surface receptors is unknown."

Loss of <i>Ret</i> function in C4da neurons severely affects dendrite coverage, dynamics, growth, and adhesion. In particular, dendrite stability and 2D growth are impaired resulting in reduced dendritic field coverage and abnormal 3D dendrite crossing, respectively. These defects can be completely rescued by Ret expression in C4da neurons. We further show that Ret interaction with integrins is needed to mediate C4da dendrite-ECM adhesion, but not dendrite growth. Our data suggest that <i>Ret</i> together with integrins acts through the small GTPase <i>rac1</i>, which is required for dendrite adhesion and 2D growth of C4da neuron dendrites as well. We thus describe a novel role for the Ret receptor in dendrite development and adhesion by direct receptor crosstalk with integrins and its downstream signals."

Knockdown of Ret resulted in abnormal C4da dendrite patterning with crossing of dendritic branches and incomplete coverage of their receptive field.

In order to validate our RNAi results, we tested the expression of Ret in C4da neurons. A Gal4 enhancer trap line inserted within the 5\u2032-region of the <i>Ret</i> gene showed C4da neuron expression when driving a GFP reporter (<i>UAS-CD8-GFP</i>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We next performed immunohistochemical analysis of larval filet preparations using Ret specific antibodies. We first used a commercial phospho-Ret antibody which showed a mostly somatic granular signal only in C4da neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We tested its specificity with a mutant allele containing a P-element insertion within the 3\u2032UTR region of the Ret gene (<i>Ret</i><sup><i>C168</i></sup>), which in combination with a deficiency covering the <i>Ret</i> locus (<i>Df(Bsc</i><sup><i>312</i></sup><i>)</i>) led to a strong reduction of the Ret immunoreactivity in C4da neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). To validate and analyze Ret expression in C4da neurons in more detail, we raised a Ret specific antibody against its intracellular domain (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Interestingly, Ret was detected throughout the dendritic arbor showing almost continuous staining along major dendrites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,C\u2032</a>) and a more granular pattern in terminal dendrites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,C\u2032\u2032</a>). We detected granular Ret signal even in distal terminal dendrites suggesting that is localizing throughout the C4da dendritic arbor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In addition, the strongest Ret puncta consistently localized to the basal side of dendrites facing the ECM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2032,C\u2032\u2032</a>). In <i>Ret</i> mutant animals, only residual immunoreactivity could be detected in C4da neuron somata but not in dendrites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,E\u2032,F</a>) suggesting that the allelic combination used is hypomorphic.

Compared to our RNAi results, we found very similar dendrite defects of C4da neurons in <i>Ret</i><sup><i>C168</i></sup> mutant animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). These defects were strongly enhanced when we combined <i>Ret</i><sup><i>C168</i></sup> with a chromosomal deficiency line (<i>Df(2L)Bsc</i><sup><i>312</i></sup>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), indicating that <i>Ret</i><sup><i>C168</i></sup> is indeed a hypomorphic allele. Strikingly, <i>Ret</i> mutant C4da neurons displayed incomplete coverage of the receptive field, with dendritic terminals exhibiting patchy distribution, reflecting abnormalities in both shape and growth directionality. In addition, we observed severe isoneuronal dendrite crossing, resulting in extensive overlap of dendritic branches not normally observed in controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>, arrows). This phenotype is reminiscent of self-avoidance defects described for <i>Dscam</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Matthews et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Soba et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hattori et al., 2009</a>) or tiling mutants like <i>trc</i>, <i>hpo</i>, <i>and fry</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Emoto et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2006</a>). To understand the nature of the dendritic crossing phenotype in <i>Ret</i> mutant larvae, we performed high resolution confocal live imaging of C4da neurons in vivo. Detailed 3D analysis of dendrite crossing points revealed that virtually all overlapping dendrites were not within the same focal plane, but grew in different planes without directly contacting one another (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,D\u2032,D\u2032\u2032</a>). Despite the severe patterning and field coverage defects, <i>Ret</i> mutant C4da neurons did not show a significant reduction in total dendrite length (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). They did however display excessive crossings of isoneuronal dendrites outside their normal 2D growth plane (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) and significantly reduced dendritic field coverage (see Figure 5B,F). Taken together, our results show that <i>Ret</i> is required for C4da neuron dendrite patterning and field coverage, and <i>Ret</i> loss of function causes out of plane dendritic crossing due to abnormal 3D expansion of dendrites."

Using loss of function analysis, we tested whether <i>rac1</i> is involved in dendrite-ECM adhesion of C4da neurons.

In addition, integrin overexpression was not able to rescue <i>Ret</i> dependent dendrite coverage defects (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). We reasoned that Ret likely exerts additional functions independent of integrins/rac1. We thus investigated the specific effects of Ret on dendrite growth and turnover. To this end, we performed time lapse analysis during late larval development at 72 hr and 96 hr after egg laying (AEL). This allowed us to monitor dendrite dynamics within a 24 hr period. In wildtype C4da neurons, significant turnover of terminal dendrites could be observed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib51\">Parrish et al., 2007</a>). Overall, we detected dendrite growth and terminal dynamics required to maintain overall field coverage and tiling during larval growth. In <i>Ret</i> mutant animals however, C4da neuron dendrites already showed defects at 48 hr AEL (not shown) and 72 hr AEL, as evident from incomplete coverage and abnormal dendrite patterning at that stage (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Increased dendrite crossing was also already apparent. Remarkably, analysis of dendrite turnover between 72 and 96 hr AEL revealed highly increased dynamics of dendritic growth and retraction, with major remodeling of the terminal dendrite arbors. Both growth and retraction of dendrite terminals in <i>Ret</i> mutant C4da neurons were increased two to threefold compared to wildtype (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Overall, the growth/retraction ratio of dendrites was significantly reduced in <i>Ret</i> mutant C4da neurons due to a disproportional increase in retraction compared to growth (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Our findings therefore suggest that Ret function is important for stabilizing growing dendrites."

Wildtype C4da neurons displayed fairly even distribution of F-actin along major dendrites, while terminal branches typically featured hotspots of increased F-actin levels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). In contrast, F-actin levels were significantly increased and unevenly distributed in proximal regions of primary dendrites of <i>Ret</i> mutant neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,G</a>).

Normally, C4da neuron dendrites are virtually always in contact with the ECM and the basal surface of the epithelium lining the larval cuticle, and thus tightly sandwiched between the two compartments (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yamamoto et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). In both integrin and <i>Ret</i> mutants, dendrite-ECM adhesion is impaired. Ret and integrins can co-localize in dendrites and thus likely form a functional complex that could induce and maintain adhesion of dendrites to the ECM. Since <i>Ret</i> loss of function primarily leads to detached terminal dendrite branches, it is tempting to speculate that Ret might be required to recruit integrins to sites of growing dendrites to promote ECM interaction. This is supported by the colocalization of Ret and integrins on the dendrite surface. Their cooperative interaction could thus ensure proper adhesion of growing branches and, conversely, the fidelity of self-avoidance and tiling."

This has so far only been studied in axon guidance in vivo (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dudanova and Klein, 2013</a>). Interestingly, vertebrate <i>Ret</i> has been shown to cooperate with Ephrins to ensure high fidelity axon guidance in motor neurons by mediating attractive EphrinA reverse signaling (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kramer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bonanomi et al., 2012</a>). Similar mechanisms may conceivably be employed for growing dendrites, which also encounter a multitude of attractive, repulsive, and adhesive cues that have to be properly integrated. Besides pathways acting independently or in a parallel fashion, an emerging view is that receptors exhibit direct crosstalk to integrate incoming signals. So far, only parallel receptor pathways like Dscam and Netrin-Frazzled signaling in class III da neurons (<a href=\"#bib47\">Matthews and Grueber, 2011</a>) or Dscam/integrins (<a href=\"#bib26\">Han et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2012</a>) have been identified co-regulating dendrite morphogenesis. Our data from this study show that the Ret receptor and integrins integrate dendrite adhesion and growth by collaborative interaction of the two cell surface receptors. The molecular and genetic link between <i>Ret</i> and integrins suggests that in this case direct receptor crosstalk plays a major role in their function. How exactly these cell surface receptors cooperate and interact remains to be elucidated. Integrins have been shown to display extensive crosstalk with other signaling receptors, including RTKs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ivaska and Heino, 2011</a>). Although integrins are involved in adhesion of virtually all cell types, the underlying signaling and recruitment of integrins to sites of adhesion in vivo is complex and not completely understood. It has been suggested that integrin and growth factor receptor crosstalk can occur by concomitant signaling, collaborative activation, or direct activation of associated signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ivaska and Heino, 2011</a>). For example, matrix-bound VEGF can induce complex formation between VEGFR2 and \u03b21-integrin with concomitant targeting of \u03b21-integrin to focal adhesions in endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2010</a>). Our findings of biochemical interaction and colocalization of Ret with the \u03b1/\u03b2-integrins <i>mys</i> and <i>mew</i> in C4da neuron dendrites argue in favor of direct receptor interaction and subsequent activation of a common signaling pathway."

These comprise, among others, the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, Pi3-Kinase (Pi3K), and Rho family GTPases including Rac1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ivaska and Heino, 2011</a>). Previous studies provide evidence for Ret-integrin-Rac1 interplay in vitro showing that Ret can enhance integrin mediated adhesion (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cockburn et al., 2010</a>) and induce Rac1 dependent lamellipodia formation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fukuda et al., 2002</a>) in cell culture models. In primary chick motor neurons, Rac1 is involved in neurite outgrowth on the integrin substrates laminin and fibronectin (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kuhn et al., 1998</a>). Interestingly, Rac1 has previously been shown to regulate dendrite branching in C4da neurons (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Emoto et al., 2004</a>), however a role in dendrite adhesion in vivo has not been described before. In our study, we show that Rac1 is required for dendrite-ECM adhesion similarly to what has been described for integrins and we genetically link Ret and integrin dependent adhesion with Rac1 function. In <i>Drosophila</i>, MAPK, Src and PI3K can be activated by constitutively active Ret overexpression in the compound eye (<a href=\"#bib53\">Read et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dar et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, novel inhibitors of Ret signaling targeting Raf, Src, and S6-Kinase (S6K) prevent lethality induced by Ret over-activation in a <i>Drosophila</i> multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2) model (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dar et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, S6K has been shown to be involved in dendrite growth but not tiling in C4da neurons (<a href=\"#bib35\">Koike-Kumagai et al., 2009</a>).

Reduced dendritic field coverage, likely due to the observed increase in dendrite turnover, is only evident in <i>Ret</i> but not in integrin or <i>rac1</i> mutant C4da neurons. Moreover, increasing integrin expression in a <i>Ret</i> mutant background did not rescue dendrite coverage defects, albeit it prevented dendrite crossing. These findings indicate that Ret has additional functions in dendritic branch growth and stability that require as yet unknown extracellular and intracellular mediators. This is also supported by the aberrant F-actin localization in neurons lacking Ret. Here, Ret dependent intracellular effectors are likely important for F-actin assembly to support directed dendrite growth and stabilization, and their localization and activity might be deregulated in the absence of Ret."

In addition, <i>Drosophila</i> Ret can neither bind GDNF nor transduce GDNF signaling, although it has been shown to contain a functional tyrosine kinase domain (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abrescia et al., 2005</a>). In mammals, the GFR\u03b1 co-receptors are essential components of GDNF/Ret signaling (<a href=\"#bib55\">Runeberg-Roos and Saarma, 2007</a>). A <i>Drosophila</i> GFR-like homolog (dGFRL) has recently been characterized and was found to function and interact with the NCAM homolog FasII (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kallij\u00e4rvi et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, it appears that Ret's functional interaction partners in dendrite development differ significantly from the previously described co-factors in other systems. It is interesting to speculate that a yet undiscovered Ret ligand is involved in Ret mediated dendrite growth and branch stabilization, which might have implications for mammalian Ret function as well: due to its role in the maintenance of dopaminergic neurons and motor axon growth in mouse (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kramer et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2007</a>), adhesion related signaling via integrins could well be important during these processes.

Briefly, we used maximum projections of 2-color stacks and aligned the GFP and LifeAct channels using the TurboReg plugin (ImageJ). The LifeAct signal was thresholded automatically (ImageJ) and normalized to GFP levels using the RatioPlus plugin (ImageJ). For LifeAct quantification along major dendritic arbors, normalized intensity values were obtained by ROI tracing of 2 major branches per sample using the PlotProfile function (ImageJ, n = 5 per genotype).

Evidence is presented to show that Ret associates with integrin and that <i>rac1</i> mediates downstream signalling. Integrin expression rescues the ECM detachment and the self-avoidance phenotypes but not the dendritic field coverage phenotype. The authors conclude that Ret is a novel receptor in the control of dendrite morphogenesis via integrin-dependent and -independent functions."

Thus endogenous Ret and overexpressed Ret-mCherry have a similar distribution within dendrites (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>). Although, with the very broad distribution of overexpressed Ret, there is bound to be some degree of colocalization between Ret and any other protein in dendrites, the resolution of our images is not the limiting factor (156x156x300 nm voxels). We did address this issue by extensively quantifying the degree of colocalization between endogenous or overexpressed Ret and integrins in C4da showing a robust positive correlation between Ret and integrin localization (please see responses below)."

We analyzed colocalization in 3D in the soma region and all dendrites of C4da neurons in high resolution confocal image stacks (160x160 \u03bcm fields) that were deconvolved and controlled for signal intensities and bleed-through (please see new section in Material and methods for details). We now provide Pearson coefficient analysis of entire C4da neuron soma and dorsal dendrite fields. Our analysis revealed that there is indeed a positive correlation of Ret and integrin signals in C4da neurons based on Pearson coefficients suggesting that a meaningful subset of Ret and integrins are colocalized (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C, F</a>)."

We thus used our newly developed Ret antibody for colocalization analyses. Unfortunately, we could not circumvent integrin overexpression in C4da neurons, as the epithelial expression of <i>mys</i> and <i>mew</i> is significantly higher than in C4da neurons thus preventing us to visualize it directly, even in the soma region. Only upon integrin overexpression we could unambiguously discern the neuronal signal and used optimized conditions to analyze colocalization with endogenous Ret. The new data and analysis is presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4 (4C-F)</a>. Similar to the Ret/integrin co-overexpression results, we did find significant colocalization of endogenous Ret and integrins in the C4da soma and in dendrites. We show representative results using colocalization channels, line scan Z stacks and line intensity plots for <i>Ret/mys</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) and <i>Ret/mew</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In addition, quantitative assessment of Pearson coefficients (as described in #2) showed a consistently positive correlation of Ret and integrin colocalization in C4da neuron somata and dendrites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). In addition, we found that endogenous Ret localizes preferentially to the basal side of dendrites which is in contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2019, C\u2019\u2019</a>). Coincidentally, we also detect most of the colocalized Ret-integrin signal facing the ECM (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2019, E\u2019</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

Although this is speculative there is precedence in the literature for transient integrin-RTK interaction and recruitment to adhesion sites (see paragraph 4 of our Discussion)."

However, dendrite crossing and growth defects are already evident at earlier stages (at least at 48h AEL). We observed numerous stretches of lower order dendrites that were detached from the ECM at the third instar stage. Whether Ret is actually required for maintaining dendrite-ECM attachment or whether these dendrites were already detached when they were originally growing remains to be investigated. Although technically challenging, this would be feasible and interesting to do in future studies."
