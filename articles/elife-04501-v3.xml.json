By contrast, flowering plants have lost essential components of the centrosome, raising the question of how flowering plants control gamete nuclei migration during fertilization. Here, we use <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to document a novel mechanism that regulates F-actin dynamics in the female gametes and is essential for fertilization. Live imaging shows that F-actin structures assist the male nucleus during its migration towards the female nucleus. We identify a female gamete-specific Rho-GTPase that regulates F-actin dynamics and further show that actin\u2013myosin interactions are also involved in male gamete nucleus migration. Genetic analyses and imaging indicate that microtubules are dispensable for migration and fusion of male and female gamete nuclei. The innovation of a novel actin-based mechanism of fertilization during plant evolution might account for the complete loss of the centrosome in flowering plants."

By contrast, flowering plants have lost essential components of the centrosome, raising the question of how flowering plants control gamete nuclei migration during fertilization. Here, we use <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to document a novel mechanism that regulates F-actin dynamics in the female gametes and is essential for fertilization. Live imaging shows that F-actin structures assist the male nucleus during its migration towards the female nucleus. We identify a female gamete-specific Rho-GTPase that regulates F-actin dynamics and further show that actin\u2013myosin interactions are also involved in male gamete nucleus migration. Genetic analyses and imaging indicate that microtubules are dispensable for migration and fusion of male and female gamete nuclei. The innovation of a novel actin-based mechanism of fertilization during plant evolution might account for the complete loss of the centrosome in flowering plants."

This is achieved in a series of complex processes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kawashima and Berger, 2011</a>). Sperm cells are immotile and delivered to the female gametes by the pollen tube. The pollen tube is guided towards the female gametes (pollen tube guidance) and interacts with a synergid cell (two specialized cells associated with the female gametes) to release sperm cells (pollen tube reception) into the area proximal to the female gametes. After the fusion between the female and male gametes (plasmogamy), the male gamete nuclei migrate towards the female gamete nuclei and fuse (karyogamy), thus completing fertilization. Several factors and molecular mechanisms controlling these early events such as pollen tube guidance and reception have been recently characterized (<a href=\"#bib20\">Higashiyama et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Palanivelu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kasahara et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Escobar-Restrepo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Okuda et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kessler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tsukamoto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Takeuchi and Higashiyama, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Leydon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Liang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ngo et al., 2014</a>), and mechanisms governing plasmogamy have been identified (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mori et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Von Besser et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mori et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sprunck et al., 2012</a>). However, how gamete nuclei migrate and fuse in flowering plants still remain largely elusive."

By contrast, the essential components of the centrosome have been lost before the emergence of flowering plants (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2011</a>), and the sperm cell nucleus moves towards the female gamete nucleus without the participation of centrosomes in flowering plants. During plant evolution, the basal plants developed actin-based organelle movements (<a href=\"#bib39\">Madison and Nebenfuhr, 2013</a>), which coincided with the centrosome loss in somatic cells in the basal land plants (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vaughn and Harper, 1998</a>). However, the genomes of bryophytes, ferns, and most likely certain gymnosperms encode components of the centrosome and these organisms produce a centrosome specifically in spermatogenous cells (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vaughn and Harper, 1998</a>). Indeed, microtubules are essential for gamete nuclear migration in the fern <i>Marsilea vestita</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kuligowski et al., 1985</a>), and these observations imply that gamete nuclear migration without the centrosome in flowering plants evolved separately from the actin-based organelle movement mechanism in somatic cells, leading to the question of how flowering plants control gamete nuclear migration without a centrosome. Immunofluorescence approaches revealed that corona structures of actin filaments around the sperm cells appear at the time of sperm cell release from the pollen tube prior to plasmogamy in many flowering plants (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huang and Russell, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Huang and Sheridan, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Ye et al., 2002</a>). Changes in F-actin organization in the egg cell during fertilization are also evident (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fu et al., 2000</a>), and indeed, an involvement of F-actin in gamete nuclear migration has been suggested during in vitro fertilization in rice (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ohnishi et al., 2014</a>). Here, we report that in contrast to animals, microtubules are dispensable for fertilization and F-actin is the primary factor controlling sperm cell nucleus migration in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Upon sperm nucleus entry in the central cell, F-actin generates an actin aster-like structure around the sperm cell nucleus while it migrates towards the female nucleus. The F-actin dynamic movement towards the central cell nucleus is established prior to fertilization and is controlled by a central cell-specific Rho-GTPase and myosin. Additional observations of F-actin function during egg cell fertilization suggest similar conclusions. Hence, flowering plants innovated a novel actin-based mechanism of fertilization that made the centrosome dispensable."

                                "text": "To investigate the requirement and function of F-actin during fertilization, we expressed the fluorescent reporter Lifeact-Venus (<a href=\"#bib49\">Riedl et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Era et al., 2009</a>) under the control of the egg cell-specific <i>EC1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sprunck et al., 2012</a>) to visualize the actin cytoskeleton in the egg cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Lifeact-Venus marked cables were disassembled after treatment with the actin polymerizing inhibitor Latrunculin A (LatA; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Pharmacological analysis by applying inhibitor drugs is useful to dissect out the cytoskeleton function at the cellular level. However, treatment with actin polymerization inhibitors disrupts functions in all cells when applied to tissues such as ovules and thus prevents the analysis on specific cytoskeleton functions in a specific cell-type. To overcome this problem, the semi-dominant negative <i>ACTIN</i> transgene (<i>DN-ACTIN;</i> <a href=\"#bib30\">Kato et al., 2010</a>) was introduced to disrupt F-actin specifically in female gametes. DN-ACTIN contains one amino acid substitution in the hydrophobic loop of <i>Arabidopsis</i> ACT8<i>,</i> which causes instability and fragmentation of actin filaments, leading to incomplete yet strong disruption of actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kato et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with the effect of DN-ACTIN reported previously, the filamentous structures shown in the wild-type (WT) egg cell became much shorter and generated aggregates in the egg cell expressing DN-ACTIN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In WT plants, fertilization leads to karyogamy followed by decondensation of the chromatin from the male nucleus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ingouff et al., 2007</a>). Egg cell fertilization initiates embryo development while the fusion of the other sperm cell with the central cell leads to endosperm development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,F</a>). By contrast, fertilization of the egg cell expressing DN-ACTIN failed as the sperm nucleus did not fuse with the egg cell nucleus and the sperm chromatin remained condensed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>; Line 1, 35% defects in <i>DN-ACTIN</i> [n = 104] compared to 0% defects in WT [n = 98]). Karyogamy was prevented only in the egg cell expressing DN-ACTIN but not in the central cell, resulting in a seed containing endosperm without an embryo [<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>; Line 1, 27% defects in <i>DN-ACTIN</i> (n = 110) compared to 0% defects in WT (n = 389)]. Taken together, these results suggest that actin cytoskeletons are required for egg cell fertilization. Consistently, other independent transgenic lines showed similar seed developmental arrest [Line 2, 20% defects (n = 125); Line 3, 22% defects (n = 114)]. Not all ovules of DN-ACTIN expressing lines showed the fertilization defect, likely because a certain fraction of actin filaments was still functional."

We expressed Lifeact-Venus under the control of the central cell-specific <i>FWA</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kinoshita et al., 2004</a>). F-actin in the WT mature central cell showed that F-actin is organized in three major distinct structures: (i) a ring-shaped actin network at the micropylar end of the central cell surrounding the synergid cells and the egg cell; (ii) long actin cables at the periphery of the central cell, extending from the chalazal region to the boundary with the egg cell; and (iii) a track formed of a bundle of actin cables, running from the micropylar actin ring to the central cell nucleus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As expected, these structures disassembled in response to LatA treatment (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). During fertilization, the track of actin cables became associated with the migrating sperm cell nucleus in the central cell from the site of fusion between the sperm cell and the central cell to the central cell nucleus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Time-lapse image analysis further confirmed F-actin association to the sperm cell nucleus during its migration in the central cell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Upon completion of karyogamy, the micropylar actin ring and bundles of F-actin associated with the sperm cell nucleus disassembled (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), suggesting that F-actin assembles transient dynamic structures dedicated for fertilization. The constitutive expression of DN-ACTIN in the central cell prevented fertilization [<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; Line 1, 30% defects in <i>DN-ACTIN</i> (n = 120) compared to 0% defects in WT (n = 153)] and endosperm development [<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; Line 1, 25% defects in <i>DN-ACTIN</i> (n = 412) compared to 0% defects in WT (n = 233)]. Other independent transgenic lines expressing DN-ACTIN in the central cell also showed similar rates of endosperm developmental defect (Line 2, 22% defects [n = 300]; Line 3, 21% defects [n = 434]). Occasionally, a few nuclear divisions were observed in the endosperm (1\u20132%), resembling a phenotype described in ovules fertilized by <i>cdka;1</i> sperm cells that are unable to undergo karyogamy (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aw et al., 2010</a>), thus supporting further that sperm cell fusion triggers central cell division. Taken together, these results suggest that F-actin also plays an important role in fertilization of the central cell."

Therefore, we could not rule out the possibility that the constitutive expression of DN-ACTIN in the central cell by the <i>FWA</i> promoter might impair the maturation of the central cell, which in turn would be responsible for fertilization failure. To overcome this problem, we designed a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible expression system (<a href=\"#bib50\">Samalova et al., 2005</a>) to activate <i>DN-ACTIN</i> after central cell maturation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). As the activator construct, the LhGR, constituted from the steroid-binding domain of a rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR, residues 508\u2013795), the mutated DNA-binding <i>lac</i> repressor (lacI<sup>His17</sup>, residues 1\u2013330), and yeast <i>GAL4</i> transcription activation domain II (Gal4-II, residues 768\u2013881), was flanked by the <i>FWA</i> promoter. The reporter construct consists of the nuclear-localized mCherry fluorescent protein (NLS-mCherry) and <i>DN-ACTIN</i> genes, connected by a self-cleaving 2A peptide derived from porcine teschovirus-1 (P2A), and this transgene was flanked by the four tandem repeats of the <i>lac</i> operator with the <i>cauliflower mosaic virus 35S</i> minimal promoter (TATA; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). During translation, the P2A sequence causes ribosome skipping, generating two individual proteins from a single transgene (<a href=\"#bib9\">El Amrani et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kim et al., 2011</a>). As a result, two proteins, NLS-mCherry and DN-ACTIN, are produced in the central cell by DEX application (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), and the NLS-mCherry can be used as a marker for spatio-temporal DEX induction. Consistent with the result from the constitutive expression of DN-ACTIN by the <i>FWA</i> promoter, DN-ACTIN induced by DEX in the mature central cell disrupted F-actin organization and prevented sperm cell nucleus migration towards the female nucleus and karyogamy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,E</a>). Endosperm development was also prevented in DEX-treated plants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,F</a>). These results confirmed that F-actin is essential for the migration of the sperm cell nucleus to the central cell nucleus."

This aster-like structure of F-actin was only observed around the sperm cell nucleus in the central cell after plasmogamy (100%, n = 48) and was never observed in unfertilized central cells (0%, n = 72). Consistently, the time-lapse imaging showed the presence of aster-like F-actin structure only during sperm cell nucleus migration [100% (n = 5); 0% in unfertilized ovule (n = 14)].The F-actin aster-like structure migrated together with the sperm cell nucleus towards the central cell nucleus (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), suggesting the involvement of specific actin regulators in this process. In plants, F-actin assembly is regulated by formins and ARP2/3 complex under the control of plant-specific Rho-GTPases (ROP; <a href=\"#bib7\">Craddock et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Henty-Ridilla et al., 2013</a>).

Indeed, we found that the <i>ROP8</i> promoter is specifically active in the central cell (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and the fusion protein Venus-ROP8 associates to the plasma membrane of the central cell (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Consistently, the ectopic expression of GFP-ROP8 also showed its association to the plasma membrane in root epidermal cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that ROP8 sub-localization is controlled by general machinery common between the gametophytic central cell and somatic root epidermal cell. To understand the function of ROP8 in the central cell during fertilization, we investigated F-actin organization in central cells expressing constitutively active and dominant-negative forms (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yang, 2002</a>) of ROP8 (<i>CA-ROP8</i> and <i>DN-ROP8</i>, respectively) under the control of the <i>ROP8</i> promoter. Although F-actin structures in both <i>CA-ROP8</i> and <i>DN-ROP8</i> appeared similar to WT (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), only <i>DN-ROP8</i> lines showed that the sperm cell chromatin in the central cell remained condensed and unfused with the central cell nucleus, when the sperm cell chromatin had already fused with the egg cell nucleus and appeared decondensed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>; Line 1, 42% defects [n = 98], Line 2, 36% defects [n = 102]).

To investigate the requirement of microtubules in <i>Arabidopsis</i> fertilization, we used a null mutant allele of <i>PORCINO</i> (<i>POR</i>) that encodes a subunit of TUBULIN FOLDING COFACTOR C (<a href=\"#bib53\">Steinborn et al., 2002</a>). Self-pollinated <i>por/+</i> heterozygous plants produce about 25% defective embryos that do not assemble microtubule and abort, indicating that viable <i>por</i> gametes fuse to produce <i>por/por</i> homozygous seeds that are not viable (<a href=\"#bib53\">Steinborn et al., 2002</a>). We expressed the TagRFP-TUBULIN ALPHA-5 in the central cell to visualize microtubules in <i>por/+</i> plants that produce 50% <i>por</i> and 50% WT gametes. In contrast to WT, about half of the female gametes from <i>por</i>/+ mutants did not show microtubule structures (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B,F</a>). This proportion was consistent with the requirement of POR function for microtubule assembly. WT and <i>por</i> mutant female gametes fertilized with either WT or <i>por</i> sperm cells showed successful karyogamy leading to the decondensation of chromatin from the sperm cell nucleus (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>; 97% in WT [n = 102] and 96% in <i>por/+</i> [n = 96]). Taken together, these results show that fertilization takes place despite defective microtubule assembly and as a result, <i>por/por</i> embryo and endosperm development initiates. Mutations in genes encoding the other subunits (A, D and E) of TUBULIN FOLDING COFACTOR cause a seed abortion phenotype similar to that described in <i>por</i> (<a href=\"#bib53\">Steinborn et al., 2002</a>), further demonstrating that microtubules are not absolutely required for fertilization in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Additionally, we investigated whether F-actin and microtubules interact to coordinate nuclear migration. However, microtubule organization was not affected in central cells expressing DN-ACTIN. Conversely in <i>por</i> central cells, the actin cytoskeleton retained its organization similar to WT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). These observations support the idea that the actin cytoskeleton is the primary factor controlling sperm cell nuclear migration during fertilization in <i>Arabidopsis</i> in contrast to most animal species in which microtubules play a major role in pronuclear migration."

Pronuclear migration in the fertilized egg is microtubule dependent, but both actin filament and microtubules are indispensable for nuclear positioning in many somatic cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Reinsch and Gonczy, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gundersen and Worman, 2013</a>). In plants, nuclear positioning during cell division and photo-relocation as well as tip growth of root hair and pollen tube has been investigated (<a href=\"#bib54\">Takagi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Higa et al., 2014</a>), and actin filaments play a critical role in these nuclear positioning events in plant somatic cells. By contrast, very little was known about gamete nuclear migration in plants. During evolution, the centrosome loss in spermatogenous cells of land plants did not coincide with either the centrosome loss in somatic cells or the initiation of the actin-based organelle movement system in plants, indicating that gamete nuclear migration in flowering plants might depend on a distinct mechanism. Here, we identified that the dynamic F-actin movement towards the central cell nucleus from the cell periphery constantly occurs prior to the sperm cell nucleus entry, and this F-actin movement is essential for sperm cell nucleus migration in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Upon entry into the central cell, the sperm nucleus becomes surrounded by F-actin, generating an aster-like structure that migrates together with the sperm cell nucleus to join the central cell nucleus for karyogamy. We also found that this dynamic F-actin movement in the central cell is controlled by gamete-specific Rho-GTPase ROP8 and is myosin dependent. On the contrary, microtubules are dispensable for sperm cell nuclear migration in both female gametes. Taken together, our results show that the sperm cell nuclear migration in flowering plants is controlled by a novel actin-based mechanism that generates a constant F-actin inward movement towards the central cell nucleus. The dynamic movement of F-actin towards the central nucleus, F-actin aster-like structure around the sperm cell nucleus during migration, and precise spatio-temporal disruption of F-actin after central cell maturation by the DEX system suggest direct involvement of F-actin for sperm cell nuclear migration. However, it still remains to be determined whether F-actin directly interacts with the sperm cell nucleus for migration. Further investigations should be made to rule out the possibility that the sperm cell nuclear migration defect by DN-ACTIN expression is not due to general perturbation of cellular structure."

In addition to the F-actin aster-like structure and the F-actin track that associate with the sperm cell nucleus migration, the central cell features a ring-shaped actin network at the micropylar end that surrounds the egg apparatus (the synergid cells and the egg cell). The F-actin ring might maintain the position of the egg apparatus for fertilization or it might act as a clamp to maintain mechanical constraints that are required for efficient sperm cell delivery. Upon completion of karyogamy, all three organized F-actin structures become disassembled, suggesting that these unique actin structures are specialized to achieve fertilization."

In the WT central cell, the constant inward movement of F-actin from the cell periphery to the nucleus occurs prior to fertilization, and this constant inward movement becomes significantly reduced in <i>DN-ROP8</i>, but not in <i>CA-ROP8</i> transgenic lines. These results suggest that ROP8 might be constantly active in the entire central cell plasma membrane, generating a constitutive dynamic inward movement of F-actin. This could explain why <i>DN-ROP8</i>, but not <i>CA-ROP8</i> transgenic lines affected F-actin dynamics significantly (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In general, the activation/inactivation of ROPs is controlled spatially at the plasma membrane, generating subdomains within a cell for downstream events such as secondary cell wall formation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Oda and Fukuda, 2012</a>) and pavement cell indentation (<a href=\"#bib61\">Xu et al., 2010</a>). Although the machinery by which ROP8 is associated to the plasma membrane is general and the activity of ROP8 in the central cell should be investigated further, this putative constant active mode of ROP8 in the central cell might shed light on a new facet of Rho-GTPase function in plant cells. F-actin function is also important for sperm cell nuclear migration in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> egg cell described here and in the rice egg cell shown by in vitro fertilization assay (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ohnishi et al., 2014</a>). It is plausible that a distinct ROP plays a similar role during egg cell fertilization, but it is also possible that other mechanisms control F-actin-dependent migration of the male nucleus to the egg cell nucleus."

However, the impairment of F-actin movement in the central cell halts sperm cell nuclear migration even in the presence of the WT-like structure of actin filaments shown in <i>DN-ROP8</i>. Hence, myosin might not transport the sperm cell nucleus towards the female nucleus as a cargo. Our observations rather suggest that myosin affects F-actin dynamics directly. In vitro, myosin also creates bipolar filaments and cross-links two actin filaments, generating a non equilibrium dynamic F-actin movement (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mizuno et al., 2007</a>). This type of dynamics is similar to the inward F-actin movement observed in the central cell, suggesting that myosin is directly involved in the dynamic inward movement of F-actin in this cell type. Yet, we have not identified which specific myosin is involved and detailed myosin function in sperm cell nuclear migration remains to be determined."

There is currently no mechanistic insight into this process in intact plants and thus this is significant work that impacts our understanding of plant reproduction in an important way. The central conclusions are backed up with multiple experimental approaches. The chief innovation of this study was the use of cell-type specific promoters to drive dominant negative ACTIN (egg and central cell) and ROP8 variants (central cell only). The images of the actin cytoskeleton in these target cells are stunning. Although Ohnishi et al used an artificial fusion system with isolated rice gametes to show an aster-like actin structure in the egg around the sperm nucleus, and that lat B disrupts sperm nuclear migration, they lacked genetic support for their pharmacological data."
