The cAMP dynamics in these subcellular compartments are ill-defined. We introduce a novel FRET-based cAMP biosensor with nanomolar sensitivity that is out of reach for other sensors. To measure cAMP dynamics in the sperm flagellum, we generated transgenic mice and reveal that the hitherto methods determining total cAMP levels do not reflect changes in free cAMP levels. Moreover, cAMP dynamics in the midpiece and principal piece of the flagellum are distinctively different. The sole cAMP source in the flagellum is the soluble adenylate cyclase (SACY). Although bicarbonate-dependent SACY activity requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>, basal SACY activity is suppressed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Finally, we also applied the sensor to primary cilia. Our new cAMP biosensor features unique characteristics that allow gaining new insights into cAMP signaling and unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliary function <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>."

The cAMP dynamics in these subcellular compartments are ill-defined. We introduce a novel FRET-based cAMP biosensor with nanomolar sensitivity that is out of reach for other sensors. To measure cAMP dynamics in the sperm flagellum, we generated transgenic mice and reveal that the hitherto methods determining total cAMP levels do not reflect changes in free cAMP levels. Moreover, cAMP dynamics in the midpiece and principal piece of the flagellum are distinctively different. The sole cAMP source in the flagellum is the soluble adenylate cyclase (SACY). Although bicarbonate-dependent SACY activity requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>, basal SACY activity is suppressed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Finally, we also applied the sensor to primary cilia. Our new cAMP biosensor features unique characteristics that allow gaining new insights into cAMP signaling and unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliary function <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>."

The new biosensor also shows that different parts of the flagellum can have different cAMP dynamics. In the future, this new biosensor could be used to study cAMP in other structures and compartments within cells."

The principal cAMP source in sperm, the bicarbonate- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive soluble adenylate cyclase SACY (<a href=\"#bib26\">Esposito et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hess et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Vacquier et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Xie et al., 2006</a>), is activated by increasing bicarbonate concentrations (<a href=\"#bib50\">Luconi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wennemuth et al., 2003</a>) after sperm are released from the epididymis.

The elevated cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA) - the primary cAMP target in sperm (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nolan et al., 2004</a>).

NKH477/IBMX treatment increased \u25b3F, reflecting an increase of cAMP levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Of note, the changes in citrine and cerulean emission are of opposite sign but similar time course, demonstrating that the changes in fluorescence were owing to FRET and not to fluorescence artefacts. The FRET change commenced within a few seconds after stimulation and reached a steady-state after 10\u2009min (ratio increase: 43 \u00b1 4%, n = 31, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). HEK293 control cells expressing the cAMP-insensitive mlCNBD-FRET-R307Q mutant did not respond (n = 3, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We also studied whether the mlCNBD-FRET sensor reports a cAMP increase mediated by G protein-coupled receptors: stimulation with 20 \u00b5M isoproterenol, an agonist of beta-adrenergic receptors, rapidly changed \u25b3F by 47 \u00b1 3% (n = 9, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). mlCNBD-FRET also reports changes in cGMP; stimulation with 3\u2009mM SNP, which releases nitric oxide (NO) that activates soluble guanylyl cyclases (<a href=\"#bib23\">Denninger and Marletta, 1999</a>), changed \u25b3F by 25 \u00b1 5% (n = 36, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Similar results were obtained using cell populations: NKH477/IBMX and isoproterenol treatment both evoked a larger change than SNP (n = 3, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). The twofold difference in the maximal changes evoked by drugs that stimulate cAMP- or cGMP-synthesis factors seems small, considering that the respective K<sub>D</sub> values differ by 10fold. Probably, at rest, the sensor is partially occupied by cAMP and stimulation with NKH477/IBMX or isoproterenol saturates the response. To test the sensor with submaximal agonist concentrations, we stimulated cells with increasing concentrations of NKH477 and analyzed the dose-response relationship (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). The EC<sub>50</sub> for NKH477 was 3.6 \u00b1 0.6\u2009\u03bcM (n = 4)."

In turn, the FRET ratio decreased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), demonstrating that mlCNBD-FRET registers both, an increase and decrease of the intracellular cAMP concentration. To rule out any unspecific effects during permeabilization, we used mlCNBD-FRET-R307Q-expressing cells as a control.

Furthermore, the basal free cAMP concentration in HEK293 cells, calculated from lifetime and intensity-based measurements, was similar (48.7 \u00b1 11.0 nM vs. 35 \u00b1 1 nM, respectively, n = 3). To evoke cAMP changes in intact cells, cells were treated with NKH477/IBMX, which also prolonged the cerulean lifetime compared to controls (\u03c4<sub>wm</sub> = 1.88 \u00b1 0.04 ns vs. \u03c4<sub>wm</sub> = 1.98 \u00b1 0.03 ns, n = 9)."

Upon addition of NKH477/IBMX, the cerulean lifetime increased when FRET decreased (\u03c4<sub>wm</sub> =2.50 \u00b1 0.02 ns, n = 9). To explore the dynamic range, we first permeabilized cells to release intracellular cAMP, followed by addition of a saturating cAMP concentration (5\u2009\u03bcM). The shift of lifetime upon changes in cAMP is illustrated in the color-coded FLIM images (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). The cerulean lifetime decreased after digitonin treatment from \u03c4<sub>wm</sub> = 2.44 \u00b1 0.02 ns to \u03c4<sub>wm</sub> =2.38 \u00b1 0.04 ns (n = 8), reflecting a cAMP decrease. Upon addition of cAMP, the lifetime increased to \u03c4<sub>wm</sub> =2.47 \u00b1 0.05 ns (n = 8, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,I</a>).

The mean K<sub>D</sub> value derived from the dose-response relation was 103 \u00b1 31 nM (n = 7, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We also measured by FLS the cerulean lifetime of mlCNBD-FRET sperm.

However, total cyclic nucleotide concentrations in cells are several orders of magnitude larger than free concentrations. Moreover, large volume ratios between the soma and small compartments like flagella might obscure the extent and time course of changes in cAMP. Therefore, we compared the dynamics of total and free cAMP in sperm upon stimulation with bicarbonate. Bicarbonate (25\u2009mM) increased the FRET ratio, reflecting an increase of the free cAMP concentration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). cAMP commenced to rise within seconds, reached a steady-state after about 5\u2009min, and persisted during bicarbonate stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In contrast, total cAMP levels, after a rapid rise (1\u2009min), declined again to basal levels within 10\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Previous studies also reported a transient increase of cAMP during bicarbonate stimulation, although the extent and speed of recovery varied among species (<a href=\"#bib3\">Battistone et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brenker et al., 2012</a>). In essence, the changes in total cAMP concentration unsatisfactorily reflect the changes in free cAMP levels in mouse sperm."

The mlCNBD-FRET biosensor is predominantly expressed in the flagellum (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Although the major if not only cAMP source is SACY (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brenker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Esposito et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hess et al., 2005</a>), a debate continues about the presence and function of transmembrane adenylate cyclases (tmACs) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buffone et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Vacquier et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Wertheimer et al., 2013</a>), for a comprehensive discussion see (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brenker et al., 2012</a>). To gain more insight, a spatio-temporal analysis of tmAC- and SACY-dependent changes in cAMP is required. Stimulation by NKH477 and bicarbonate discriminates between tmACs and SACY activity, respectively. Thus, we measured cAMP dynamics in the freely beating flagellum of mlCNBD-FRET sperm upon perfusion with 40\u2009\u03bcM NKH477 or 25\u2009mM bicarbonate. mlCNBD-FRET is equally distributed along the flagellum, which allows distinguishing between the cAMP dynamics in the midpiece and principal piece (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; blue and green region, respectively). Invariably, no cAMP change in either the midpiece or principal piece was detected after perfusion with NKH477 (0 \u00b1 3%, n = 3, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Thus, our results rule out the presence of tmACs in the sperm flagellum. However, perfusion with bicarbonate increased cAMP levels in both, midpiece (26 \u00b1 3% ) and principal piece (22 \u00b1 10% ) (n = 7, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). To compare the response kinetics in the two compartments, individual traces were fitted using a logistic regression (Origin 9.0) and average data were plotted (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The kinetics of the cAMP increase by bicarbonate was faster in the principal piece than in the midpiece, indicating that cAMP dynamics in these two compartments is differently regulated."

The analysis has been hampered by the lack of suitable tools to manipulate and analyze cAMP signaling in such a tiny cellular compartment. We set out to target mlCNBD-FRET to primary cilia. Protein import into the cilium is tightly regulated by the intraflagellar transport machinery (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</a>). For targeting to cilia, we fused the mlCNBD-FRET sensor to the C-terminus of the ciliary somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) (<a href=\"#bib37\">H\u00e4ndel et al., 1999</a>); as control, we fused a green-fluorescent protein (eGFP) to SSTR3 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Both constructs were expressed in IMCD3 cells, which carry primary cilia. In fact, both constructs were targeted to primary cilia (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). To test whether fusion of mlCNBD-FRET to SSTR3 affects the sensor properties, SSTR3-mlCNBD-FRET was expressed in HEK293 cells. Compared to mlCNBD-FRET, SSTR3-mlCNBD-FRET was localized to intracellular membranes rather than uniformly distributed throughout cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B vs. 8D</a>). Stimulation with isoproterenol (20\u2009\u03bcM) increased the FRET ratio by approximately 25% compared to 40% for the non-tagged sensor (n = 9, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E vs. 8E</a>). Thus, the SSTR3-mlCNBD-FRET fusion protein allows measuring cAMP dynamics. The functionality of mlCNBD-FRET in primary cilia of IMCD-3 cells was tested by acceptor photobleaching experiments. Upon bleaching, the cerulean emission increased (n = 11, 43 \u00b1 21%), demonstrating that the SSTR3-fusion protein undergoes FRET (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). In summary, mlCNBD-FRET is a versatile tool that can be used to measure cAMP dynamics with nanomolar sensitivity in solution, in different cell types, and small cellular compartments like the cilium or flagellum."

First, unlike any other cAMP biosensor, the purified mlCNBD-FRET protein can be used in solution. Remarkably, the properties in solution and inside cells are by and large similar. Second, mlCNBD-FRET can be selectively targeted to subcellular compartments like primary cilia or sperm flagella to directly measure cAMP dynamics. Third, the sensor exhibits a significantly improved cAMP sensitivity compared to other single-protein biosensors, e.g. Epac-based FRET sensors. Thereby, it extends the range of accessible cAMP concentrations to the low nanomolar range. In fact, other cAMP sensors are unable to quantify resting cAMP levels in some cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">B\u00f6rner et al., 2011</a>). Finally, the sensor is compatible with fluorescence intensity and lifetime-based approaches. These favorable characteristics prompted us to revisit a lingering debate about cAMP signaling in sperm."

SACY is the major source for cAMP in sperm and total cAMP levels in SACY<sup>-/-</sup> sperm are below the detection limit (<a href=\"#bib86\">Xie et al., 2006</a>). Members of the tmAC family and the corresponding G proteins reportedly localize to the sperm head, i.e. they are spatially segregated from SACY and PKA in the flagellum (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wertheimer et al., 2013</a>). Our result that bicarbonate, but not NKH477, increases flagellar cAMP levels strengthens the notion that SACY represents the only cAMP source in the flagellum. Furthermore, considering that the head volume is much larger than that of the flagellum, our results also argue that the flagellum either is sealed up and that cAMP in the head does not propagate to the flagellum, or that NKH477-sensitive tmACs are absent altogether. A physical barrier that restricts diffusion of cAMP between midpiece and head is unlikely to exist, because Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering the flagellum via CatSper channels propagates to the head (<a href=\"#bib72\">Servin-Vences et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Xia et al., 2007</a>).

An important requisite for capacitation <i>in vitro</i> is bicarbonate and the ensuing rise of cAMP followed by PKA activation. PKA activity must be maintained for at least 30\u2009min to initiate tyrosine phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Morgan et al., 2008</a>), which requires 90\u2009min to complete. However, in mice, total cAMP levels return to basal values within 10\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This begs the question how PKA activity is sustained when cAMP levels recover during bicarbonate stimulation. We resolve this conundrum in mouse sperm by showing that the free cAMP concentration stays up during measurements (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus, total cAMP levels do not properly reflect free cAMP concentrations in live cells. This might be due to compartmentalization of cAMP signaling in sperm, similar to what has been shown for cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib88\">Zaccolo et al., 2006</a>), or due to buffering by cAMP-binding proteins. A case in point is the rod photoreceptor (<a href=\"#bib87\">Yau, 1994</a>). The free cGMP concentration in the dark is approximately 1\u2009\u03bcM, whereas most of the total cGMP content (50\u2009\u03bcM) is bound to high-affinity sites of PDEs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cote et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">1986</a>). Light stimulation activates PDE, cGMP levels drop, and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels close, giving rise to a hyperpolarizing light response. Notably, a drop of the total cGMP concentration (maximally 50% ) requires light intensities that are orders of magnitude larger than those that saturate the light response (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cote et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">1986</a>). Likewise, the total cGMP concentration in sea urchin sperm is a few \u00b5M, whereas, at rest, the free cGMP must be \u22643 nM (<a href=\"#bib10\">B\u00f6nigk et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kaupp et al., 2003</a>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in sea urchin sperm saturates at \u226420 pM of the chemoattractant, whereas approximately 5 nM chemoattractant are required to detect a noticeable rise of total cGMP concentration (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kaupp et al., 2003</a>)."

SACY activity is stimulated by bicarbonate in buffer containing 2\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but not in low micromolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carlson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Navarrete et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wennemuth et al., 2003</a>). Recent findings suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> has a biphasic role in the regulation of cAMP signaling (<a href=\"#bib58\">Navarrete et al., 2015</a>): at micromolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conditions, bicarbonate does not stimulate PKA activity or increase tyrosine phosphorylation; however, chelating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> using EGTA in the presence of bicarbonate relieves the inhibition, stimulating PKA activity, and increasing tyrosine phosphorylation. Similarly, in CatSper1<sup>-/-</sup> sperm, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is lower than in wild-type sperm (<a href=\"#bib66\">Ren et al., 2001</a>), yet tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of bicarbonate is enhanced (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chung et al., 2014</a>). One interpretation of these seemingly puzzling results suggests that bicarbonate can stimulate SACY at normal and very low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, but not at intermediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<a href=\"#bib58\">Navarrete et al., 2015</a>). However, such a biphasic control by Ca<sup>2+</sup> has not been observed <i>in vitro</i>. Instead, the activity of isolated SACY protein upon bicarbonate stimulation is steadily enhanced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jaiswal and Conti, 2003</a>). Alternatively, Ca<sup>2+</sup> might control cellular signaling downstream of cAMP. Here, we show that cAMP levels do not significantly change during bicarbonate stimulation at very low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (2 nM); thus, a bicarbonate-dependent cAMP increase is not underlying the stimulation of PKA activity and tyrosine phosphorylation under these conditions. However, under conditions that are expected to significantly lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, basal SACY activity is stimulated, indicating that SACY activity is controlled by a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent negative feedback that operates in intact sperm, but is absent on the isolated or heterologously expressed protein. Regulation of SACY activity via another negative feedback has been described before (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burton and McKnight, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Nolan et al., 2004</a>). In sperm lacking the catalytical PKA subunit C\u03b12, both basal and bicarbonate-stimulated cAMP levels are higher than in wild-type sperm (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burton and McKnight, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Nolan et al., 2004</a>), suggesting that PKA-dependent phosphorylation indirectly or directly down-regulates SACY activity."

However, even along the flagellum, cAMP signaling is compartmentalized; the cAMP dynamics stimulated by bicarbonate is different in the midpiece and the principal piece. We favor the idea that distribution and activity of PDEs is different in the midpiece and principal piece. PDE are targeted to distinct domains in sperm (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bajpai et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lefi\u00e8vre et al., 2002</a>). Moreover, at least two PDE isoforms and splice variants, PDE4 (cAMP-specific) and PDE1 (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent) are involved in the control of sperm motility and tyrosine phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fisch et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Leclerc et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lefi\u00e8vre et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Visconti et al., 1995</a>).

During permeabilization, the pH<sub>i</sub> might change if the extracellular and intracellular pH is different. Using the pH indicator BCECF, we determined a pH<sub>i</sub> of 7.2 \u00b1 0.1 (n = 4) in mlCNBD-FRET-expressing HEK293 cells. Accordingly, we set pH<sub>o</sub> during permeabilization to 7.2 to assure that no pH change occurs. Increasing concentrations of cAMP were then added to the cell suspension that eventually saturate the FRET sensor. The FRET ratio for each cAMP concentration was plotted against the cAMP concentrations and analysed by linear regression.

First, an image of the cilium was obtained in the donor channel using 405 nm laser excitation and 480/40 nm emission and an image in the acceptor channel using 488 nm laser excitation and 560/40 nm emission. Photobleaching was performed at 510/20 nm using a mercury lamp (C-LHGFIE, Nikon) for 2\u2009min. This was followed by the acquisition of two images, one in the donor channel and another in the acceptor channel. The donor channel was compared to the images before and after acceptor photobleaching and the increase in intensity was quantified after background subtraction. The amount of bleaching was assessed by comparing citrine fluorescence before and after bleaching."

                                "text": "For spatial-temporal-resolved measurements, sperm from transgenic mice were imaged with a dual-view microscopic setup. Cerulean was excited at 440/20 nm (Lumencor Spectra X light engine) combined with a 438/24 nm excitation filter (Semrock). In addition, a dichroic mirror 455 nm DRLP and an additional filter with 460 nm ALP (Edmund optics,\u00a0Karlsruhe,\u00a0Germany) was used. Emission light was collected with an objective (40x, NA 0.95; Olympus, USA) and detected with an EMCCD Camera (iXon Ultra 897, Andor). In the dual-view emission path, a beam splitter (DV2, 515 dxcr, Mag Biosystems,\u00a0Exton,\u00a0PA) with a cerulean and citrine emission filter (475/28 nm and 535/50 nm, respectively; Semrock) was used. Thereby, both channels were acquired simultaneously with an acquisition frequency of 1\u2009Hz. The resulting video was analyzed with a self-developed image analysis plugin for ImageJ. First, the citrine and the cerulean channel was registered (MultiStackReg, ImageJ). Second, the flagellum was tracked and the signal intensity of the citrine and the cerulean channel was determined along the flagellum. By using the pre-determined bleed-through value for the citrine channel (0.69 \u00b1 0.01), changes in FRET ((emission<sub>cerulean</sub> \u2013 0.69 x emission<sub>citrine</sub>)/emission<sub>citrine</sub>) was calculated, normalized to the baseline, and plotted versus time for each position along the arc length. The droplet separates the midpiece and the principal piece; thus, both regions were selected at a distance 5\u201310 \u00b5m apart from the droplet. The mean signal intensity and the standard deviation was determined in both regions for 20 \u00b5m along the arc length. The values were plotted over time and a logistic regression (Origin 9.0) was used to determine the kinetics within the two regions. The parameters of the logistic regression for different experiments were used to determine the average kinetics within the two regions."

They generate transgenic mice expressing it in sperm flagellae and primary cilia. The results suggest that free cAMP in the flagellum is distinct from that in midpiece or head, and is dominated by soluble bicarbonate-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC10). This is a useful tool for monitoring free cAMP in sperm and cilia. This work is exciting because it represents a completely new type of cAMP sensor that doesn't rely on sequences from mammalian PKA, Epac or cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. An important feature of mlCNBD-FRET is its high affinity for cAMP. Null-point calibration estimated that resting cytosolic cAMP is around 35nM. This is perhaps the first accurate measurement of resting free cAMP, although this may reflect a mixture of resting cGMP and cAMP. Another useful feature is that the sensor protein can be isolated and used <i>in vitro</i> to monitor cAMP. The experiments in sperm cell and cilia nicely demonstrated the feasibility of using the probe <i>in vivo</i>, but these studies are preliminary and yielded less well-supported new information. All reviewers felt the paper was most appropriate as a 'Tools and Resource' paper."

Also the results with 25mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> are ambiguous. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> indicates a strange pH sensitivity of the reporter, and it's not certain how pH changes upon NaHCO<sub>3</sub> addition. A control experiment to measure pH upon NaHCO<sub>3</sub> treatment, and an independent test of FRET changes of mlCNBD-FRET using a maneuver known to change pH in a defined manner (e.g. NH3 or lactate) would be helpful. Does the cAMP-insensitive mlCNBD-FRET-R307Q respond to NaHCO<sub>3</sub>? One reviewer noted that in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B, D</a>, in the experiments where [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> is manipulated, the authors interpret the changes of FRET signals as changes in [cAMP]. It is possible that the reduction/increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> also changes intracellular pH or [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], which in turn affects the FRET signal independent of changes in [cAMP] (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). A simple \"negative\" control is perhaps to repeat the experiment in the presence of NKH477. The inhibitor presumably should also block the FRET changes induced by increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>."
