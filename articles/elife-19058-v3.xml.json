Sdks mediate cell-cell adhesion with homophilic specificity that underlies their neuronal targeting function. Here we report crystal structures of Sdk1 and Sdk2 ectodomain regions, revealing similar homodimers mediated by the four N-terminal immunoglobulin domains (Ig1\u20134), arranged in a horseshoe conformation. These Ig1\u20134 horseshoes interact in a novel back-to-back orientation in both homodimers through Ig1:Ig2, Ig1:Ig1 and Ig3:Ig4 interactions. Structure-guided mutagenesis results show that this canonical dimer is required for both Sdk-mediated cell aggregation (via <i>trans</i> interactions) and Sdk clustering in isolated cells (via <i>cis</i> interactions). Sdk1/Sdk2 recognition specificity is encoded across Ig1\u20134, with Ig1\u20132 conferring the majority of binding affinity and differential specificity. We suggest that competition between <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> interactions provides a novel mechanism to sharpen the specificity of cell-cell interactions."

Sdks mediate cell-cell adhesion with homophilic specificity that underlies their neuronal targeting function. Here we report crystal structures of Sdk1 and Sdk2 ectodomain regions, revealing similar homodimers mediated by the four N-terminal immunoglobulin domains (Ig1\u20134), arranged in a horseshoe conformation. These Ig1\u20134 horseshoes interact in a novel back-to-back orientation in both homodimers through Ig1:Ig2, Ig1:Ig1 and Ig3:Ig4 interactions. Structure-guided mutagenesis results show that this canonical dimer is required for both Sdk-mediated cell aggregation (via <i>trans</i> interactions) and Sdk clustering in isolated cells (via <i>cis</i> interactions). Sdk1/Sdk2 recognition specificity is encoded across Ig1\u20134, with Ig1\u20132 conferring the majority of binding affinity and differential specificity. We suggest that competition between <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> interactions provides a novel mechanism to sharpen the specificity of cell-cell interactions."

Studies in chicks and mice have revealed that defined interneuron and RGC subtypes express one or more of 10 closely related IgSF members: Sdk1, Sdk2, Dscam, DscamL1, and Contactins 1\u20136 (CNTNs\u00a01\u20136) in largely non-overlapping patterns (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yamagata et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib60\">2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fuerst et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shekhar et al.,\u00a02016</a>). In chick, Sdk, Dscam and CNTN family proteins are present as interneuron-RGC synapses form, and both knockdown and over-expression experiments show that they are necessary and sufficient for directing neural processes to particular sublaminae in the IPL (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yamagata et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib60\">2012a</a>). In mice, Sdk1, Sdk2, Dscam, DscamL1 and CNTN5 mutants each exhibit specific defects in arborization and connectivity within the IPL (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fuerst et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</a>; Peng et al., unpublished). In one case, the specific connectivity of an interneuron type (vesicular glutamate transporter 3-positive amacrine cells or VG3-ACs) to a specific RGC type (W3B-RGCs) depends upon expression of Sdk2 in both cell types: transmission from VG3-ACs to W3B-RGCs fails in Sdk2 mutants and the RGCs no longer respond to their canonical visual feature (<a href=\"#bib26\">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</a>). These results have led to the hypothesis that IgSF-mediated homophilic interactions bias synaptic connectivity in favor of appropriate partners, thus generating information processing circuits in the retina. Since all 10 of these IgSF molecules are also expressed by neuronal subsets throughout the central nervous system (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yamakawa et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agarwala et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Shimoda and Watanabe, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stoeckli, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yamagata and Sanes, 2012a</a>), similar interactions may mediate connectivity in multiple brain regions."

These four domains adopt a horseshoe conformation, like many other IgSF cell-cell recognition proteins, but they interact in a unique back-to-back anti-parallel manner not previously observed. Mutagenesis studies both in vitro, with analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) readouts, and in situ with a cell aggregation assay readout, demonstrate that the crystallographic dimer is present in solution and is required for Sdk-mediated cell aggregation. Interestingly, this same dimer is also required for <i>cis</i>-clustering of Sdk-molecules in isolated cells. Structures of multiple crystal forms of Sdk1 and Sdk2 revealed an unexpected flexibility in the dimer arrangement: The antiparallel contacts between Ig1\u20132 regions from each protomer were maintained in all structures, however the degree of contact between the Ig3\u20134 regions was highly variable. Consistent with this observation, mutagenesis studies showed that the Ig1\u20132:Ig1\u20132 interaction was necessary for dimerization, whereas mutations that interfered with the Ig3\u20134:Ig3\u20134 interaction had only a modest effect on dimer affinity. Overall, our data suggest a model in which Sdks form <i>cis</i> dimers on isolated cell surfaces, which dissociate to form <i>trans</i> dimers through the same interface when contact is made to a cell surface expressing the cognate Sdk. Competition between these <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> dimers may provide a mechanism to enhance the homophilic specificity of Sdk-mediated interactions."

A chimeric construct (SdkD, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) comprising Ig1\u20135 and part of Ig6 from Sdk2 and the remainder of the molecule from Sdk1 could mediate adhesion to Sdk2 but not Sdk1 in a mixed cell aggregation assay, using either L cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>) or N-cadherin deficient HEK-293 cells (data not shown), indicating that it is the Ig domain region that mediates cell-cell recognition in common with other IgSF proteins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gouveia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Haspel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wojtowicz et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sawaya et al., 2008</a>).

Adhesion was unperturbed by this replacement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Thus Sdk-mediated cell-cell adhesion requires the extracellular but not the intracellular domains of the proteins, with key determinants of homophilic specificity in Ig1\u20136."

Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) measurements showed that Sdk1 and Sdk2 Ig1\u20134, Ig1\u20135, and Ig1\u20136 were each dimers in solution with low-micromolar affinities (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) with the Sdk2 dimer exhibiting ~5-fold stronger affinity than the Sdk1 dimer for each truncation construct tested. These affinities are similar to other cell-cell recognition proteins, such as <i>Drosophila</i> Dscam1 isoforms (1\u20132 \u00b5M; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wu et al., 2012</a>) and classical cadherins (8\u2013130 \u00b5M; <a href=\"#bib18\">Harrison et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Vendome et al., 2014</a>). Ig1\u20134 is therefore sufficient for dimerization in solution for both Sdks. We further note that the Ig1\u20136 constructs for both Sdk1 and Sdk2 gave 4\u20135-fold stronger dimerization affinities than the Ig1\u20134 constructs (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), However, the addition or deletion of domains that do not participate in the interface frequently lead to small changes in binding energy, and this does not always reflect the presence of additional interactions. For example, we previously observed human VE-cadherin EC1\u20135 to have ~4-fold stronger dimerization affinity than the EC1\u20132 fragment (1.03 vs. 4.38 \u00b5M), even though the entire dimerization interface is contained within EC1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brasch et al., 2011</a>). The effect of additional domains on the\u00a0binding affinities may be due in part to entropic differences in the unbound state whereby crowding effects may affect the\u00a0conformational freedom for the longer constructs."

Two non-overlapping interfaces hold the horseshoe together: a conserved and relatively rigid Ig1:Ig4 interface and a more flexible and varied Ig2:Ig3 interface (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). These intramolecular interactions bury extensive combined intramolecular surface areas of 2620 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> in Sdk1, 2459 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> in Sdk2 and 2567 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> in the Sdk2<sub>Ig1\u20132</sub>/Sdk1<sub>Ig3\u20134</sub> chimera, implying that the horseshoe should be a stable element in all of these molecules.

These occur between the side chains of Ig4 residues D325 (from Ig4 C strand WXXN/D motif) and Q359 (from Ig4 F strand \u03a6Y/F/LQC motif) and the main chain of Ig1 residues A79 and L81 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Despite the presence of these motifs and the requisite long Ig2\u2013Ig3 linker, Chen et al., who surveyed the presence of IgSF horseshoe motifs through sequence analysis, did not identify Sdks as horseshoe motif-containing molecules. This is because Sdks\u2019 lack an internal disulfide in Ig2, which Chen et al. used to define the Ig2\u2013Ig3 linker length in their bioinformatics search. The internal Ig2:Ig3 interface appears to lack conserved features amongst IgSF horseshoe proteins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). In Sdk1 and Sdk2 the Ig2:Ig3 interaction is mediated by the\u00a0main chain to side chain hydrogen bonds between Sdk-conserved residues (S137<sub>Ig2</sub>:R247<sub>Ig3</sub>, I142<sub>Ig2</sub>:R248<sub>Ig3</sub>, and L144<sub>Ig2</sub>:E216<sub>Ig3</sub>), alongside van-der-Waals interactions among hydrophobic residues (L144<sub>Ig2</sub>, V149<sub>Ig2</sub>, L151<sub>Ig2</sub>, V/I198<sub>Ig3</sub>, V/I199<sub>Ig3</sub>, and V218<sub>Ig3</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

The linker between Ig4 and Ig5 is only one amino acid (N379) and there is a small Ig4:Ig5 interface with a buried surface area (BSA) over both domains of ~370 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>. This interface\u2014involving the linker region, the Ig4 AB loop and the Ig5 BC loop\u2014likely provides rigidity to the Ig4\u2013Ig5 junction. In Sdk2 the Ig4\u2013Ig5 linker is the same length as in Sdk1, although the linker residue is serine rather than asparagine, and the Ig4:Ig5 interfacial residues are mostly conserved between Sdk1 and Sdk2 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), except key Ig4 AB loop residue 302 which is a methionine in Sdk2 rather than a valine. The arrangement of Ig4 and Ig5 in Sdk2 is therefore likely to be similar to that observed in Sdk1.

The Sdk1 and Sdk2 Ig1:Ig2 interfaces, which are contiguous with the central Ig1:Ig1 interface, consist of two networks of hydrogen bonding interactions clustered around residues E31<sub>Ig1</sub> and E/D168<sub>Ig2</sub>; a salt bridge between E31<sub>Ig1</sub> and K133<sub>Ig2</sub> (corresponding to a region of complementary electrostatic potentials between Ig1 and Ig2, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>); and a number of hydrophobic residue contacts including V4<sub>Ig1</sub>:I/P135<sub>Ig2</sub> and L/M29<sub>Ig1</sub>:V166 <sub>Ig2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A and 4B</a>).

Therefore, different IgSF members utilize different horseshoe-motif surfaces to mediate homophilic interactions, highlighting the versatility of the motif. Heterophilic interactions have also been reported for horseshoe-motif proteins, including binding of CNTNs 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 to receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase gamma (PTP\u03b3) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouyain and Watkins, 2010</a>). The crystal structure of CNTN4 with the carbonic anhydrase-like domain from PTP\u03b3 shows that horseshoe domains Ig2 and Ig3 mediate this interaction, utilizing the same face for interaction as the Dscam1 homodimer (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouyain and Watkins, 2010</a>). To date no heterophilic interactions have been reported for the Ig domain regions of Sdk, however the opening of the Ig3\u20134 regions in the Sdk dimers could in principle accommodate interaction with another molecule, or potentially the FNIII portion of the Sdk extracellular region. Indeed, the flexibility of the Sdk dimer interaction that we have observed in our Sdk1 and Sdk2 crystal structures is surprising and could be explained by the need to accommodate an additional interaction."

Disrupting Sdk1 Ig1\u20134-mediated dimerization by mutation of a key interfacial residue (N22R) resulted in a loss of this Sdk clustering in isolated cells. Instead the Sdk1 N22R mutant showed a more diffuse expression across the whole cell surface, with only small clusters evident (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This indicates that the Sdk1 Ig1\u20134-mediated dimer is required for Sdk clustering in large aggregates. For some cell surface molecules such as classical cadherins, binding <i>in cis</i> through the cell-cell recognition interface is geometrically unfavorable due to the rigidity of the interacting molecules. However, since in Sdks there are 13 FNIII domains and two additional Ig domains separating the horseshoe \u2018dimerization\u2019 region from the membrane, the molecules are sufficiently flexible such that there should be no geometric constraints preventing the formation of a <i>cis</i> dimer. The observed Ig1\u20134-dimer-dependent <i>cis</i>-clusters are clearly larger assemblies than dimers. Moreover, Sdks still cluster after replacing their native cytoplasmic domain with YFP or RFP, demonstrating that intracellular sequences are dispensable. Therefore, additional interactions involving the FNIII, or Ig domain regions are also likely to contribute to their formation. In addition the presence of small aggregates in the N22R mutant cells could indicate that such additional <i>cis</i> interactions may form independent of the horseshoe-mediated dimer.

In contrast, in solution Sdk Ig1\u20134 proteins dimerize both homophilically and heterophilically although the homophilic interactions are significantly stronger. We suggest three possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy. First, cell aggregation depends on the affinities of adhesion molecules; so strong homophilic interactions will lead to the formation of separate aggregates even when weaker heterophilic interactions can also occur (<a href=\"#bib22\">Katsamba et al., 2009</a>). Second, we cannot exclude the possibility that determinants proximal to Ig1\u20134 enhance homophilic or attenuate heterophilic interactions. Third, and most interesting, competition between <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> interactions could sharpen specificity. The Sdk Ig1\u20134-mediated dimer is required for both Sdk <i>cis</i>-clustering in isolated cells and Sdk-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Since both interactions are mediated by the same interface, <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> dimers are likely to be mutually exclusive. Thus, <i>cis</i>-dimers formed between Sdks on the same cell surface would need to dissociate in order for Sdk dimers to form <i>in trans</i> between molecules on adjacent cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Since homophilic interactions are stronger than heterophilic interactions, heterophilic <i>trans</i> interactions would not be able to outcompete homophilic <i>cis</i> interactions, ensuring that no adhesion will be observed between cells containing different Sdks. An analogous logic is used to enhance binding specificity in classical cadherins which dimerize through a strand swapping mechanism (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vendome et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Vendome et al., 2014</a>)"

A mouse monoclonal antibody to mouse Sdk1 was generated from a Sdk1-knockout mouse (<a href=\"#bib26\">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</a>) immunized with mouse Sdk1-expressing L cells. Briefly, splenocytes from a hyperimmunized mouse were fused to a myeloma cell line FOXNY (ATCC), selected, and screened by immunostaining Sdk1-transfected L cells. One established hybridoma line, MS1-7, produces an IgG1/kappa monoclonal antibody that recognizes FNIII domains of mouse Sdk1 (not shown). Chicken anti-GFP antibodies were described previously (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yamagata and Sanes, 2012b</a>). Species-specific Alexa dye-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Fluorescein-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Cultured cells on glass coverslips (Bellco Glass, Vineland, NJ) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, and then either observed directly after mounting with Fluorogel (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA), or immunostained after treatment with 0.1% (w/v) TritonX-100/PBS for 10\u2009min at room temperature. The standard immunostaining procedure used was described previously (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yamagata and Sanes, 2012a</a>). Images were analyzed using a PlotProfile or the Analyze Particles plug-in of Image-J (version 1.47d, Fiji). For immunostaining of Sdk1 on the cell surface, cells were incubated with DMEM plus 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum supplemented with purified 1 \u00b5g/ml MS1-7 antibody (IgG1) for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, rinsed with the same medium, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, stained with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies, rinsed, mounted, and observed under a confocal microscope. Alternatively, the bound antibodies were quantified using a colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly, after incubating live cells with MS1-7, the paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were treated with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/PBS for 30\u2009min at room temperature, blocked with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk (BioRad)/PBS for 30\u2009min, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:1000 dilution in 0.5% BSA/PBS) for 2\u2009hr, rinsed with PBS, and developed with o-phenylenediamine/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>."

Previous studies have shown that Sdk1 and Sdk2 exhibit preferential homophilic binding. That is, heterophilic binding occurs but homophilic binding is stronger. The role of these two paralogs has been characterized best in the context of layer-specific connections in the chick and mouse inner plexiform layer of the retina. Here Sdk1 and Sdk2 act with other Ig superfamily proteins, Dscam and DscamL1, and various contactins to regulate layer-specific connectivity. In this paper, Goodman et al. describe the molecular basis of Sdk-mediated cell adhesion. The paper includes several crystal structures, biophysical studies using analytical ultracentrifugation and Biocore to assess binding quantitatively and cell adhesion experiments to explore the interaction of the proteins in the context of living cells."

                    "text": "The ectodomains of Sdk1 and Sdk2 comprise, from the N-terminus, 6 Ig domains and 13 FNIII repeats. Several crystal structures were determined for N-terminal fragments including Ig1-4 from Sdk1 and Sdk2, Ig1-5 for Sdk2, and a chimera which includes the Ig1,2 from Sdk1 and Ig3,4 from Sdk2. All formed horseshoe-like structures with Ig1 and 2 aligned in a linear fashion followed by a short loop between Ig2 and Ig3, as the ectodomains flip back with alignment of Ig3 and Ig4 in parallel with Ig1 and Ig2. Contacts between Ig1 and Ig4 and between Ig2 and Ig3 stabilize the horseshoe. Remarkably, although other Ig superfamily homophilic adhesion molecules also form this characteristic horseshoe structure, the contacts between monomers underlying dimer formation are very different re-emphasizing how uncanny this three-dimensional structure is in generating different recognition strategies. A set of binding studies on mutant proteins provides strong support for the biological significance of the crystal structures. All of the experiments are well designed and executed to yield clear answers to a series of logically constructed questions. The combined data allow the authors to propose an insightful model for the mechanism of action of Sdk1 and Sdk2 which will be of substantial interest to neurobiologists and structural biologists alike. The hypothesis that the strength of the homophilic cis interactions serves to deter heterophilic, and hence favour homophilic, trans interactions is salient. In sum, the work is a strong candidate for <i>eLife</i>."
