Previously, we have shown that floral scent is important to mediate pollen transfer between plants (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kessler et al., 2015</a>). Yet, the mechanisms by which pollinators evaluate volatiles of single flowers remained unclear. Here, <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i> plants, in which floral volatiles have been genetically silenced and its hawkmoth pollinator, <i>Manduca sexta</i>, were used in semi-natural tent and wind-tunnel assays to explore the function of floral scent. We found that floral scent functions to increase the fitness of individual flowers not only by increasing detectability but also by enhancing the pollinator's foraging efforts. Combining proboscis choice tests with neurophysiological, anatomical and molecular analyses we show that this effect is governed by newly discovered olfactory neurons on the tip of the moth's proboscis. With the tip of their tongue, pollinators assess the advertisement of individual flowers, an ability essential for maintaining this important ecosystem service."

Previously, we have shown that floral scent is important to mediate pollen transfer between plants (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kessler et al., 2015</a>). Yet, the mechanisms by which pollinators evaluate volatiles of single flowers remained unclear. Here, <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i> plants, in which floral volatiles have been genetically silenced and its hawkmoth pollinator, <i>Manduca sexta</i>, were used in semi-natural tent and wind-tunnel assays to explore the function of floral scent. We found that floral scent functions to increase the fitness of individual flowers not only by increasing detectability but also by enhancing the pollinator's foraging efforts. Combining proboscis choice tests with neurophysiological, anatomical and molecular analyses we show that this effect is governed by newly discovered olfactory neurons on the tip of the moth's proboscis. With the tip of their tongue, pollinators assess the advertisement of individual flowers, an ability essential for maintaining this important ecosystem service."

Floral scent not\u00a0only\u00a0attracts pollinators (<a href=\"#bib17\">Klahre et al., 2011</a>), but also manipulates them through chemical mimicry (<a href=\"#bib33\">St\u00f6kl et al., 2010</a>) and repels herbivores (<a href=\"#bib12\">Junker and Bl\u00fcthgen, 2010</a>), altogether increasing plant fitness (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kessler et al., 2008</a>). However, research studying the function of floral scent has been divided along two themes with little cross-fertilization: 1) studies examining the fitness effects of floral scent without the causal behavioral responses of pollinators (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kessler et al., 2008</a>), or 2) studies examining the sensory physiology of pollinators, neglecting the ecological consequences for the plant (<a href=\"#bib26\">Raguso, 2008</a>). Here, we meld these approaches and show that floral scent increases the fitness of individual flowers not only by increasing their detectability (<a href=\"#bib25\">Raguso and Willis, 2002</a>), but also by enhancing the pollinator\u2019s foraging motivation, and demonstrate that this is mediated by olfactory receptors on the tip of the moth\u2019s proboscis which detect floral scent."

In spite of this simplicity, producing BA might come at considerable metabolic but especially ecological cost, as BA might attract not\u00a0only\u00a0nectar thieves and florivores, but also female hawkmoths in search of oviposition sites (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baldwin et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kessler et al., 2010</a>). Plants might therefore reduce the amount of floral volatiles released as much as possible without losing their pollination services. Field experiments using plants in which the emissions of BA had been silenced by RNAi of the biosynthetic gene <i>NaChal1</i> (CHAL) have shown that BA is required to maximize pollination success (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kessler et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">2015</a>). It was suggested that lacking this scent made plants in nature 'invisible' to hawkmoth pollinators. However, the precise mechanisms by which odors of single flowers influence pollinator behavior and thereby plant fitness have rarely been examined in the direct interaction between plant and pollinator (<a href=\"#bib17\">Klahre et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Riffell et al., 2008</a>). Hence, how floral scent emitted by individual flowers functions in this mutualistic interaction remained unknown, particularly as it is unclear how pollinators detect single volatile compounds within complex natural environments (<a href=\"#bib7\">Hansson and Stensmyr, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Riffell et al., 2014</a>)."

The flight tracking revealed that moths chose to visit the same number of emitting and non-emitting flowers in a random sequence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, probability of changing between EV or CHAL flowers during consecutive visits: 0.47). In a second bioassay conducted in a wind tunnel (2.4\u2009m \u00d7 0.9\u2009m \u00d7 0.9\u2009m, moonlight [0.5 lux of sunlight spectrum]), we presented plants with either emitting or non-emitting flowers to individual moths and analyzed their flight patterns, approaches and flower contacts. In none of these analyses, we found any difference between plants with emitting and non-emitting flowers (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). These results suggest that visual cues and general vegetative plant odors provided sufficient information for the moths to locate flowers, consistent with previous work using artificial flowers (<a href=\"#bib25\">Raguso and Willis, 2002</a>) and clearly showing that non-scenting flowers are not 'invisible' to moths."

                        "text": "If non-scenting flowers are found by moths, why is plant fitness reduced? Does BA emission change the pollination probability? To test this, we loaded the moth\u2019s proboscis with a standardized number of pollen grains using a fine brush. When such pollen-enhanced moths were allowed to forage freely on antherectomized <i>N. attenuata</i> flowers, seeds produced per flower of EV and CHAL plants differed significantly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Scentless flowers matured very few seeds, reflecting the inferior pollination services provided by the moths despite a similar number of visits. This result highlights the importance of BA emission for the fitness of individual flowers and confirms the results of previous studies, which investigated the effects of BA emission on plant fitness at a population level (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kessler et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">2015</a>). But if the flowers were equally detectable by the moths, what behavioral mechanism was responsible for the plant fitness consequences?"

                        "text": "To analyze the effect of BA emission on moth behavior in greater detail, we quantified the time invested by a moth at individual flowers in a wind tunnel assay. The moths spent significantly more time at emitting than at non-emitting flowers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) particularly while trying to insert their proboscis, so even before tasting the floral nectar (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, having successfully inserted their proboscis, the time of nectar uptake was similar between them (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This suggests that BA emission increased the motivation of moths to forage when individual flowers were evaluated at a close range, possibly because BA emissions, are closely linked to the physiological state and thereby also to the potential nectar amount of a flower (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bhattacharya and Baldwin, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Yon et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kessler et al., 2015</a>). By increasing the probing time in BA-emitting flowers, moths increased their success rate at their first as well as at consecutive flower visits and, therefore, collected more nectar per flower visit in tent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and wind tunnel assays (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). These results agree with a study using different <i>Petunia</i> lines which found that although flower scent aided navigation, increased nectaring was the most consistent effect of floral scent\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Klahre et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "The large fitness consequences of floral volatiles for both moth and plant beg the question: how do moths evaluate the headspace of individual flowers? The wide spread of the antennae and their distance from the flower resulting from the moth\u2019s long proboscis which is fully extended during nectaring suggests that the olfactory spatial resolution of the antennae might be too low to resolve individual flowers in an inflorescence or even between neighboring plants (<a href=\"#bib34\">Willis et al., 2013</a>). Hence, we inferred that the moth\u2019s proboscis might play a role in flower perception (<a href=\"#bib6\">Goyret and Raguso, 2006</a>). Using reverse transcription PCR, we qualified the accumulation of transcripts of olfactory genes in the proboscis of <i>M. sexta</i>. Similar to the mosquito <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, but contrasting with predictions for nectar feeding insects (<a href=\"#bib11\">Jung et al., 2015</a>), we found that the olfactory co-receptor Orco was expressed in the tip region of the proboscis along with the ionotropic co-receptor, IR25a (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Notably, Orco was only expressed in the first centimeter of the proboscis whereas the ionotropic co-receptor, IR8a, was only found in upper sections. This heterogeneous distribution of olfactory genes is consistent with the idea that the moth proboscis plays a more complex role in chemoreception than previously thought (<a href=\"#bib27\">Reiter et al., 2015</a>). Screening the proboscis tip by scanning electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) we found a sensillum type that\u00a0was\u00a0not previously described for <i>M. sexta</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Reiter et al., 2015</a>). This sensillum resembled the known sensillum styloconicum, but instead of a single tip pore, had a multiporous cone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B<sub>4</sub></a>). Similar sensillum types have been described in other lepidopteran species (<a href=\"#bib5\">Faucheux, 2013</a>), but their function remained unknown, although the presence of odorant-binding proteins suggested a role in olfaction (<a href=\"#bib21\">Nagnan-Le Meillour et al., 2000</a>). We used an antibody raised against Orco (Nolte et al., unpublished), and found a single Orco- positive cell only in the first multiporous sensilla styloconica (mSt) at the tip of the proboscis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Each arm of the Y-maze was either connected to a source of humidified air or humidified air scented with BA (0.1\u00a0mM). By drawing air directly behind the entrance of the Y-maze, the experimental set-up excluded antenna-based olfaction. Hence, as soon as a moth entered the flower aperture during free hovering flight, only the proboscis experienced the air stream containing either a solvent control, or BA (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). During their first and subsequent insertions, the moths chose both Y-tube arms with equal frequency (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), but inserted their proboscis for a significantly longer time into the arm containing the BA-scented air (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), demonstrating that the moth was able to detect BA with only the proboscis. Moths seem to use the olfactory input from the proboscis not for orientation on the corolla, but rather to assess the specific quality of an individual flower, consistent with the notion that the close-range orientation of the proboscis on the flower can be informed by mechanical and visual cues (<a href=\"#bib6\">Goyret and Raguso, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Sponberg et al., 2015</a>)."

Floral volatiles, such as BA, not only function as navigational cues (<a href=\"#bib8\">Haverkamp et al., 2016</a>), but also inform pollinators about the identity and the physiological state of individual flowers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bhattacharya and Baldwin, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Yon et al., 2015</a>). Only BA-emitting flowers encourage the moth to visit a flower long enough to lead to successful pollination. Our results show that floral scent is an essential chemical feature for hawkmoths to gain nectar from, and pollinate, a single flower. Interestingly, many flowers require that their pollinators acquire particular handling skills on their first visits, before the insects are able to use the flower efficiently (<a href=\"#bib20\">Laverty, 1994</a>). This energy investment by the pollinator not only helps ensure outcrossing for the plant, but provides the insect with a more exclusive nectar source (<a href=\"#bib10\">Heinrich, 1979</a>). In a recent study, inexperienced <i>M. sexta</i> were found to sometimes expend more energy on\u00a0handling flowers than they gained from the nectar; if additional experience increases foraging efficiency, this would compel the moth to visit additional flowers of the same species (<a href=\"#bib8\">Haverkamp et al., 2016</a>). Notably, the ability to smell BA with the tip of the proboscis may not only increase the motivation of <i>M. sexta</i> to invest energy into BA emitting flowers, but also strengthen the moth\u2019s learning of these flowers, as the nectar reward becomes associated with the presence of BA. Such a BA-conditioned learning rate might help to ensure a positive energy balance for the moth while at the same time ensuring cross-pollination for the plant (<a href=\"#bib9\">Heinrich and Raven, 1972</a>). However, the question to what extent the interaction of moths and plants relies on the moths\u2019 learning ability requires additional attention in future studies."

These emissions might be a consequence of the physiological requirement for scent compounds by certain pollinator guilds when collecting nectar, even when visual cues would be sufficient to attract pollinators to a plant. The ongoing evolutionary interaction between plants and pollinators relies heavily on floral scent (<a href=\"#bib22\">Parachnowitsch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Schiestl and Johnson, 2013</a>), and may explain the absence of scent-free plants in native <i>N. attenuata</i> populations (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kessler et al., 2015</a>). To pollinators with the appropriate sensory system, floral scent provides a wealth of information, highlighting the importance of chemical communication in this mutualism, on which many of our crops rely (<a href=\"#bib23\">Radera et al., 2015</a>)."

Plants were moved from the glasshouse to the tent which was located directly adjacent to the glasshouse. Experiments in the tent were conducted between August 27 and September 8 2014. Ten plants of each of the two lines EV and CHAL were aligned in rows at the central section of the tent. EV and CHAL plants were positioned directly next to each other, even touching inflorescences. The position of the EV and CHAL plants were changed after each moth, to minimize potential position effects. In order to use only freshly opened flowers, all open flowers were removed each morning, before experiments were conducted. Six to eight male <i>M. sexta</i> moths were released sequentially per night. A new moth was released only when the previous had stopped flying and every moth was only used once. Single flower visitations were observed, the genotype and time at a single flower was noted, and after the visitation, the approached flowers were removed to measure the remaining nectar. Each moth had up to 10 flower encounters and for each moth the mean nectar gain across all flower encounters was calculated."

For this, 3\u20134 flowers per plant of each line (EV and CHAL) were used in the wind tunnel, one plant and one moth at each time. Fresh pollen was collected in the corresponding morning from plants not being used for pollination. EV pollen which had been collected the previous night was rubbed on the hawkmoth proboscis using a fine brush prior to its release in the wind tunnel, in order to measure the pollen delivery to experimental flowers. If moths did not take flight voluntarily within 3\u2009min after being placed in the wind tunnel they were excluded from the study. Moths, which took flight (73% ), were allowed to do so for four minutes in each wind tunnel trial. The numbers of matured capsules, as well as the seeds produced from each capsule were counted after ripening. Capsules were collected shortly before opening, approximately 14 days after the experiment, dried in a desiccator, and once opened, the seeds were counted in petri dishes. After each trial the pollen from each <i>M. sexta</i> was collected by washing the proboscis to ensure that similar amounts of pollen had been placed on the proboscis. For pollen counts, the same procedure as for the pollen retrieval was used. On average, we found that 548.75 (n= 41, SEM= 88.85) pollen grains had been placed on a single proboscis.

The description of the multi-pored sensillum that can respond to the floral volatile benzyl acetone is new and electrophysiological as well as behavioural assays show that the sensillum responds to benzyl acetone. Yet, the reviewers feel that some more information is needed on this new sensillum to better understand its role in the perception of the flowers. The main issues to be dealt with are the following: (a) the title where the word proboscis would be the correct word to be used, (b) the specificity of the sensillum by testing more than only the response to benzyl acetone, but also other volatiles emitted by <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>. After all, <i>N. attenuata</i> nectar produces more volatiles than only benzyl acetone (Kessler et al. 2007 Plant J.), (c) is the sensillum also involved in sugar perception: does the sensillum also house a sugar responding dendrite? and (d) the role of benzyl acetone perception by the probiscis of na\u00efve moths versus moths that have gained experience that do not require scented nectar; this has consequences for the discussion (Discussion section, last paragraph) on the herbivore-pollinator trade-off. In addition, the reviewers have made many valuable additional comments that will be useful to further improve the manuscript."

The description of the multi-pored sensillum that can respond to the floral volatile benzyl acetone is new and electrophysiological as well as behavioural assays show that the sensillum responds to benzyl acetone. Yet, the reviewers feel that some more information is needed on this new sensillum to better understand its role in the perception of the flowers. The main issues to be dealt with are the following: (a) the title where the word proboscis would be the correct word to be used, (b) the specificity of the sensillum by testing more than only the response to benzyl acetone, but also other volatiles emitted by Nicotiana attenuata. After all, N. attenuata nectar produces more volatiles than only benzyl acetone (Kessler et al. 2007 Plant J.), (c) is the sensillum also involved in sugar perception: does the sensillum also house a sugar responding dendrite? and (d) the role of benzyl acetone perception by the probiscis of na\u00efve moths versus moths that have gained experience that do not require scented nectar; this has consequences for the discussion (Discussion section, last paragraph) on the herbivore-pollinator trade-off.

Nonetheless, we would hypothesize that experience might further increase the difference between emitting and non-emitting flowers as moth that forage on emitting flowers have a higher change of receiving a nectar reward and might therefore continue to forage on emitting flowers, and not at non-emitting once. Moths are also more likely to learn a flower which provides both visual as well as olfactory information (Riffell and Alarc\u00f3n, 2013), which might again increase the preference of the moth for scented flowers. This hypothesis is consistent with the results of our tent experiments in which we allowed the moth to encounter up to 10 flowers consecutively and analysed the mean nectar gain of each moth (we have now tried to clarify this in the Methods section, subsection \u201cTent\u201d). We found that after these consecutive flower encounters, the difference in the nectar uptake between the emitting and the non-emitting flowers was even greater than in our wind tunnel assays, in which the moth encountered only a single flower. Moreover, we have analysed the percentage of foraging success for consecutive visits on EV and CHAL plants in the free flight tent and included this as <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>. These results indicate the high success rate of <i>M. sexta</i> on emitting flowers is indeed maintained also during consecutive flower visits whereas the foraging success on non-emitting flowers remains relatively low. Hence we would expect that the difference between emitting and non-emitting flowers would rather be maintained or even increased (as one could assume that moths become more efficient in handling emitting flowers, after they learned to associate a nectar reward with the presence of BA).

Therefore, if the observed effect would have only been present during the first flower encounter one would have expected that the effect would be diminished after consecutive flower visits; however, we found the opposite. The effect was even stronger after these consecutive visits than what was observed in the wind tunnel where the moth had only excess to a single flower (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Furthermore, we have now calculated the success rate of the moth in the tent assay over consecutive flower visits and found that both the high success rate on emitting flowers as well as the relatively low success rate on non-emitting flowers are maintained over consecutive flower encounters (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Thus learning did not appear to change the overall success rate of the moth. Nonetheless, we would hypothesize that the moth might still be able to learn how to handle flowers more effectively and we would expect that in the case of the scented flower this effect might be even stronger than with non-scented flower, since the moths were more likely to obtain a reward from the scented flowers and reward quantity is thought to influence the strength of the motor learning (Wright et al., 2009). Moreover, the fact that the moths can also make use of visual and olfactory information, the scent might further reinforce and increase their learning rate (Riffell and Alarc\u00f3n, 2013).

The study also shows that flowers engineered not to emit BA receive inferior pollination services, and that less nectar is removed from them. The simplest interpretation of these results taken together is that pollination and nectar removal depend on the sensilla, although this is not demonstrated directly by ablation or masking experiments.</i>"

Interestingly, we found that while the senisillum responded most strongly to BA and the structurally related benzyl acetate, it could also detect some other potentially relevant compounds such as nicotine although at a much lower level."
