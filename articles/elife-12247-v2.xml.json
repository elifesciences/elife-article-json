We performed time-lapse imaging of thousands of neurons over weeks in the hippocampal CA1 of mice as they repeatedly visited two distinct environments. Longitudinal analysis exposed ongoing environment-independent evolution of episodic representations, despite stable place field locations and constant remapping between the two environments. These dynamics time-stamped experienced events via neuronal ensembles that had cellular composition and activity patterns unique to specific points in time. Temporally close episodes shared a common timestamp regardless of the spatial context in which they occurred. Temporally remote episodes had distinct timestamps, even if they occurred within the same spatial context. Our results suggest that days-scale hippocampal ensemble dynamics could support the formation of a mental timeline in which experienced events could be mnemonically associated or dissociated based on their temporal distance."

We performed time-lapse imaging of thousands of neurons over weeks in the hippocampal CA1 of mice as they repeatedly visited two distinct environments. Longitudinal analysis exposed ongoing environment-independent evolution of episodic representations, despite stable place field locations and constant remapping between the two environments. These dynamics time-stamped experienced events via neuronal ensembles that had cellular composition and activity patterns unique to specific points in time. Temporally close episodes shared a common timestamp regardless of the spatial context in which they occurred. Temporally remote episodes had distinct timestamps, even if they occurred within the same spatial context. Our results suggest that days-scale hippocampal ensemble dynamics could support the formation of a mental timeline in which experienced events could be mnemonically associated or dissociated based on their temporal distance."

Episodic memory, the mental account of \u201cwhat\u201d happened, \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d, depends on a region of a brain called the hippocampus. Certain neurons in the hippocampus, called place-cells, are known to capture information about the locations an animal has visited so that a specific pattern of place cell activity marks each location an animal visits. However, it is not clear how the brain can mark the relationship between the timing of different events."

The patterns persisted even when the animals switched to a new environment during the same day, but were different for visits to the same environment on different days. Next, Rubin, Geva et al. used the patterns of activity collected from the mice while they were in one environment to create a timeline of events. From this timeline, it was possible to accurately deduce which day each visit to the other environment occurred based on the patterns of hippocampal cell activity alone. One challenge that stems from this work is to understand the biological mechanisms that drive the patterns in neuronal activity over timescales that are relevant for long-term memory."

                        "text": "The capacity to remember temporal relationships between different events is essential to our autobiographical memory and sense of self. Autobiographical or episodic memory relies on the hippocampus, whose neurons are thought to encode information about <i>where</i> and <i>when</i> events have occurred (<a href=\"#bib7\">Davachi and DuBrow, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Eichenbaum, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Howard et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rolls, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Shapiro, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tulving, 2002</a>). Hippocampal place cells encode the spatial location of an animal through localized firing patterns, and have long been considered a substrate for long-term memory of the location in which events occurred (<a href=\"#bib31\">O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">O'Keefe, 1978</a>). Whereas ample knowledge exists regarding the encoding of location, relatively little is known about the neural mechanisms that enable the encoding of the time in which events occur. Recent work has revealed that in familiar environments hippocampal place cell activity is dynamic over timescales that range from minutes to weeks (<a href=\"#bib11\">Howard and Kahana, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Mankin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mankin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Manns et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ziv et al., 2013</a>). For timescales that are greater than one day, these dynamics primarily result from ongoing changes in the subsets of place cells that are active during repeated visits to the same fixed environment (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ziv et al., 2013</a>). Such dynamics may contribute information about the temporal relationship between events by providing a unique code that functions as a \u2018timestamp\u2019. If such timestamps exist, they would likely aid long-term memory by reducing interference between traces of events that occur at different times at the same place, or that are similar in that they share contextual components such as sensory experience and behavior. Moreover, to support the formation of a mental timeline of experienced events in long-term memory, and the capacity to mentally \u2018time-travel\u2019 during memory recall (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kragel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Nyberg et al., 2010</a>), timestamps should change gradually and continuously with time. Such gradual changes in the ensembles of place cells active during similar events on different days have been recently reported, but the extent that these dynamics actually carry temporal information remains unclear (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mankin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ziv et al., 2013</a>). We consider two alternative hypotheses regarding the possible contribution of the observed dynamics to coding of time. According to one hypothesis, the dynamics in the ensemble activity over days is unique to the environment in which it is observed, and independent from the dynamics in other, dissimilar environments. In this case, the dynamics may contribute ordinal information about different events that occur within a given environment, but will not contribute to associations in memory between events that happen close in time if these events occurred in different or dissimilar environments. An alternative hypothesis asserts that certain aspects of the days-scale dynamics in the ensemble activity are common to different environments. Such environment-nonspecific dynamics could support a linkage in long-term memory between dissimilar events that occur at temporal proximity. If this is the case, we would expect the hippocampal representations of events that occur in different spatial environments but in temporal proximity (e.g. the same day) to share common time-varying components."

We combined head-mounted miniaturized fluorescence microscopes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ghosh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ziv et al., 2013</a>), chronic microendoscopy (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barretto et al., 2011</a>), and viral-vector based expression of a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2013</a>), to longitudinally image the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics of large populations (&gt; 1,000 per mouse) of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in freely behaving mice that repeatedly explored two familiar environments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To avoid circadian effects we alternated the two environments between AM and PM sessions, 4\u20135 hr apart. Each session consisted of five 3-min trials. To maximize the perceived differences between the environments, we constructed linear tracks (environments A and B) that differed in shape, floor texture, surrounding proximal and distal visual cues, odor, and flavor of the water reward (see Materials and methods). To uncover the time-dependent coding dynamics, while minimizing changes in place codes induced by learning, we familiarized the mice with the two environments before starting the experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). During pre-training, the mice ran on each linear track for 15 min per day for 8\u201311 days, until they performed at least 60 laps in each environment for two consecutive days. Time-lapse imaging began two days after the last pre-training session, and was performed every other day for two weeks (days 1\u201315, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

However, this is unlikely to be the case here due to several factors: the correlations between the place field maps of the two environments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), the difference in cell activity rates between the two environments (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), and the distance between the cell\u2019s peak activity in each environment (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) all did not change over time, indicating a stable spatial remapping. Furthermore, the fractions of cells that were place coding in both environments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), the average number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in a session, the amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, and the fraction of cells that were place coding on different days of the experiment in each environment, remained similar between environments throughout the experiment (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C-E</a>). Two-photon imaging of the CA1 before and after the experiment showed no indications of cell morbidity, such as time-dependent differences in the cells\u2019 morphology or Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator expression patterns (<a href=\"#bib36\">Tian et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>). Our findings that the functional properties of CA1 neurons remained stable throughout the experiment, argues against the possibility that the changes in spatial representation we observed result from pathological processes (e.g. due to overexpression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator or photo-toxicity). Also, the number of sessions in which cells were active, and the fraction of cells with place fields for left and right directions of the linear tracks remained similar for both environments and GCaMP6 variants (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>).

Non-place cells generated almost half of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (46%), mostly during resting or reward consumption at the ends of the linear tracks. Thus, neuronal activity during an episode on the linear track was much richer than the part of the data that is limited to place codes.

To address this question while accounting for the neuronal activity at the ensemble level, we constructed three types of neuronal \u2018time decoders\u2019. The decoders are based on the knowledge that the similarity between ensemble activity patterns of different episodes decays as a function of elapsed time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). We first quantified whether the coding dynamics are informative about the temporal relationships between different events that occurred days to weeks apart within either one or both of the environments. We used an \u2018ordinal-time decoder\u2019 to determine if days-scale changes in CA1 ensemble activity are informative about the order of experienced events. This decoder examines data from all days and orders them by maximizing the mean correlation between cells\u2019 firing patterns on neighboring days (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We tested the decoder\u2019s performance on entire sessions, (each 15 min long) for each environment separately and for both environments together, and contrasted the results with those obtained using data in which the day labels of each cell were randomly shuffled. When data from only one of the environments were included in the analysis, performance was significantly superior compared with chance levels for accurate ordinal sorting and the performance of the decoder on shuffled data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, blue data points). Notably, when data from both environments were included in the analysis, the decoder performed perfectly, accurately ordering all sessions along the experiment in all five mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, red data points, and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Thus, day-to-day differences in the activity patterns of CA1 neurons carry ordinal information. This result argues against the possibilities that the observed differences in neuronal activity between sessions are merely the result of inherently unreliable neuronal responses, or due to fluctuations of cell excitability over minutes to hours. Such alternative explanations are unlikely to support perfect ordinal sorting over multiple days."

Accordingly, we expected that different trials or fractions of trials from the same session would be similarly time-stamped. To determine the consistency of such timestamps within the same environment, we devised a decoder that estimates the day in which an episode was recorded based on the correlations between different trials or fractions thereof (\u2018within-environment time decoder\u2019). Using single 3-min trials as test data, this decoder accurately inferred the days from which the test data was taken (98 \u00b1 1% of the cases). To determine to what degree temporal information is carried in the changes in neuronal firing rates we performed the analysis again, this time relying only on cells that were active on all days. This decoder was accurate in 80% of the cases, significantly higher than chance (z-test, p &lt;\u00a07\u00a0\u00b7\u00a010<sup>\u201348</sup>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The decoder\u2019s performance on shuffled test data was essentially identical to chance levels (12.5% for accurate decoding). Remarkably, even data from very short, several-seconds-long fractions of trials, were sufficient for correct decoding of the day of experiment from which the test data was taken (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Thus, a unique timestamp of events arises from changes in the cell activity levels over time. Our data suggest that such timestamps are not only captured within the CA1 representations of complete episodes but are also highly consistent within short fractions of an episode."

To test this idea we constructed an \u2018across-environment time decoder\u2019 that quantifies the degree to which the time of events in one environment can be inferred by a decoder that is trained on data from another environment. We tested this decoder\u2019s ability to correctly identify from which day of the experiment the test data was taken (the test data consisted of entire sessions or single 3-min-long trials). Despite marked differences in the spatial representation of the two environments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and an inter-session interval of 4\u20135 hr for sessions taking place on the same day, the across-environment time decoder was able to infer the days from which the test data was taken in 65% and 58% of the cases for sessions and trials respectively, significantly higher than chance (z-test, p &lt; 6\u00a0\u00b7\u00a010<sup>\u20137</sup>\u00a0and 4\u00a0\u00b7\u00a010<sup>\u221222</sup>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>).

Indeed, when excluding the training data from the same day of the tested trials or sessions, the decoders inferred the neighboring days in the vast majority of cases (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results are consistent with our finding of a gradual co-evolution of the CA1 ensemble representation of both environments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>).

Several recent studies have provided important insights into the hippocampal function with respect to coding of time in memory, suggesting that multiple time-coding mechanisms exist to cover different timescales and mnemonic needs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mankin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mankin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Manns et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Navratilova and Battaglia, 2015</a>). For instance, \u2018time cells\u2019, hippocampal pyramidal cells that fire during a particular moment within a temporally structured episode (<a href=\"#bib9\">Eichenbaum, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kraus et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">MacDonald et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Modi et al., 2014</a>), may contribute to a representation of sequences of events over timescales of tens of seconds. Due to the seconds to minutes-scale nature of their activity, time cells are less likely to place individual uniquely experienced episodes on a linear temporal axis extending over days. Pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal area CA2 (upstream to CA1) were found to display representations that are similar for different contexts but highly variable upon repeated exposures over timescales of hours. It was suggested that such CA2 dynamics, when combined with spatial information from CA3, could jointly reflect spatial and temporal information in CA1 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mankin et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2015</a>). However, it was argued that the rapid dynamics in CA2 could support encoding a temporal order between events over timescales that range from hours to one day (<a href=\"#bib29\">Navratilova and Battaglia, 2015</a>), whereas many events in our episodic memory are ordered over much longer timescales."

Such ensemble dynamics may be regarded as a form of \u2018remapping\u2019 in the time domain. Spatial remapping is thought to reflect a mechanism for pattern separation, which could help prevent interference between representations of similar places (<a href=\"#bib6\">Colgin et al., 2008</a>).

Our findings demonstrate that the representations of two environments were highly distinct, yet sufficiently co-evolved with time to allow us to infer the day in which events occurred in one environment using reference data from the other environment.

Our findings are consistent with reports showing that changes in neuronal excitability govern which neurons will be recruited to code and support a memory of a given experience (\u2018memory allocation\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rogerson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Yiu et al., 2014</a>). Repeated training episodes may alter cell excitability via consolidation or reconsolidation processes involving the expression of immediate early genes and their downstream effectors (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dudai, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Lee, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nader and Hardt, 2009</a>). Such processes may change episodic representations irrespective of the amount of time that has passed between repeated events. Thus, while we have shown in this study that CA1 ensemble dynamics carry temporal information over days, further work is needed to differentiate between the contributions and functional roles of experience-dependent and experience-independent processes that take place in the brain during the passage of time."

We removed the dura and cortex above the CA1 by suction with a 29 gauge blunt needle while constantly washing the exposed tissue with sterile PBS.

We inserted a \u2018microendoscope\u2019 consisting of a single gradient refractive index lens (0.44 pitch length, 0.47 NA,\u00a0GRINtech GmbH,\u00a0Germany) into the guide tube, and examined Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator expression and tissue health. We selected for further imaging only those mice that exhibited homogenous GCaMP6 expression and healthy appearance of the tissue. For the selected mice, we then affixed the microendoscope within the guide tube using ultraviolet-curing adhesive (Norland, NOA81,\u00a0Edmund Optics,\u00a0Barrington, NJ). Next, we attached the microscope\u2019s base plate to the dental acrylic cap using light cured acrylic (Flow-It ALC, Pentron,\u00a0Orange, CA). After a few days, we began training the mice to run back and forth on two elevated linear tracks (Environments A and B). Environment A was a straight 96 cm long track and Environment B was an L-shaped track consisting of two 48 cm long arms. Each environment had distinct sets of visual and tactile cues, overhead lights, flavored liquid rewards, and odor cues. Before the beginning of each pre-training or imaging session we wiped the tracks with differently scented paper towels (0.5% acetic acid for environment A and 10% ethanol for environment B). We trained the mice to run back and forth along the track by giving them a measured amount of water sweetened with commercial fruit juice concentrate, lemon flavored for track A and raspberry flavored for track B, with 2% added sugar by weight. The water reward was dispensed using a custom-made computer controlled device. To record mouse behavior, we used an overhead camera (DFK 33G445, The Imaging Source,\u00a0Germany), which we synchronized with the integrated microscope. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was performed at 20Hz. Before beginning with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we pre-trained the mice for 8\u201311 days, until the mice ran at least 60 times the entire length of each track in two consecutive days. Pre-training and imaging sessions consisted of five 3-min-long trials, with an inter-trial interval of 3 min. We imaged a total of 5 mice (two that were injected with AAV2/5-CaMKII\u03b1-GCaMP6f and three that were injected with AAV2/5-CaMKII\u03b1-GCaMP6s) every other day for 15 days, making for 8 recording days. Each day of the experiment consisted of two sessions (AM and PM) separated by 4\u20135 hr. Remapping tests within a single session were performed on days 16\u201317. At the end of the experiment we removed the base plate by drilling away the top acrylic cap and re-examined the health of the CA1 neurons by imaging the mice under isoflurane anesthesia using a two-photon microscope as described above."

To correct for non-uniform illumination both in space and time, we normalized the images by dividing each pixel by the corresponding value in a smoothed version. The smoothed version was obtained by applying a Gaussian filter with a radius of 40 pixels on the videos. Normalization enhanced the appearance of the blood vessels, which were later used as stationary fiducial markers for image registration. We used rigid body image registration to correct for lateral displacements of the brain. This procedure was performed on a high contrast subregion of the normalized movies for which the blood vessels were most prominent. The registered movies were transformed to relative changes in fluorescence,\u00a0<math id=\"inf1\"><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2206</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>'</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>'</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2212</mo><mi>F</mi><msub><mo>'</mo><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>)</mo><mo>/</mo><mi>F</mi><msub><mo>'</mo><mn>0</mn></msub></math>, where <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><msup><mi>F</mi><mo>'</mo></msup><msub><mrow></mrow><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></math> is the value for each pixel averaged over time. For the purpose of cell identification the movies were downsampled in time by a factor of five. We identified spatial filters corresponding to individual cells using an established cell-sorting algorithm that applies principal and independent component analyses (PCA and ICA) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mukamel et al., 2009</a>). For each spatial filter, we used a threshold of 50% of the filter\u2019s maximum intensity and each pixel that did not cross the threshold was set to zero. After the cells were identified, further cell sorting was performed to find the spatial filters that follow a typical cellular structure. This was done by measuring the filters\u2019 area and circularity and discarding those whose radius was smaller than 5\u00a0\u03bcm or larger than 14 \u03bcm, or which had a circularity smaller than 0.8. In some cases, the output of the PCA/ICA algorithm included more than one component that corresponded to a single cell. To eliminate such incidents, we examined all cells whose centroids were less than 18\u00a0\u03bcm apart and whenever their traces had <i>correlation</i> &gt; 0.9, the cell with the lower average peak amplitude was discarded."

Baseline fluctuations were removed by subtracting the median trace (20 s sliding window). The Ca<sup>2<b>+</b></sup> traces were smoothed with a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 2Hz. Ca<sup>2<b>+</b></sup> candidate events were detected whenever the amplitude crossed a threshold of 4 or 5 median absolute deviations (MAD), for GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f, respectively. Cellular Ca<sup>2<b>+</b> </sup>events are characterized by fast rise and slow decay times. To capture these characteristics in our data we considered for further analysis only candidate Ca<sup>2<b>+</b> </sup>events that followed typical indicator decay time, and decay-to-rise time ratios. In order to avoid the detection of several peaks for a single Ca<sup>2<b>+</b></sup> event, only peaks that were 4 or 5 MAD higher than the previous peak (within the same candidate event) and 2 or 2.5 MAD higher than the next peak for GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f, respectively, were regarded as true events.

We computed the spatial cross-correlation among the projections from all sessions to align them according to a reference session. Because changing the reference did not change the alignment output, we chose the first session as the reference. This step corrected slight translations and rotation changes between sessions and yielded each cell\u2019s location in the reference coordinate system. Next, we searched for cells from different sessions that might be the same neuron. This was performed using two separate methods based on either spatial correlations or centroids distances (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1 and 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2\u20136</a> show longitudinal data for which we used the spatial correlations-based registration method. <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a> shows longitudinal data for which we used the centroids distances-based registration method.

We divided each track into 24 bins (4 cm each) and excluded the last 2 bins at both ends of the tracks where water rewards were consumed and the mouse was generally stationary (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ziv et al., 2013</a>). We computed the time spent in each bin, and the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events per bin, and smoothed these two maps (\u2018occupancy\u2019 and \u2018Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0event\u00a0number\u2019) using a truncated Gaussian kernel (\u03c3 = 1.5 bins, size = 5 bins). We then computed the place field map for each neuron by dividing the two smoothed maps of Ca<sup>2+</sup> event\u00a0number and occupancy. We separately considered place fields for left and right running directions and normalized each place field by its maximum value. We defined each place field's position at its peak value. For each place field with &gt;5 events for a given session, we computed the spatial information (in bits per event) using the unsmoothed events-rate map of each cell, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib24\">Markus et al., 1994</a>):"

The question though is whether or not the technological advancement evident in the current study resulted in substantive advancement of the field above and beyond the methodology. One complication in evaluating this latter question is the extent to which the authors focused on only the most recent literature and thus provided a narrow perspective of how their study fit into existing knowledge. Numerous earlier studies and models of how gradually changing neural representations could add a temporal dimension to memory are ignored. In addition, of the more recent work that is cited (e.g., Mankin et al., 2012), the authors do not clearly show how the present results differ from and thus add to the prior results (aside from the imaging technique used to obtain the data). As a result, one gets the sense that the current study reveals more about the promise of the technique rather than contributing new findings."

In contrast, they find that CA1 ensembles that are recorded on the same day in two different environments resemble each other. While the number of cells that can be recorded with calcium imaging is certainly much higher than with standard electrophysiological techniques, the reported results largely resemble those that were obtained in previous recording studies which have already reported and proposed many of the key conceptual points. Notably, closely related publications (e.g., Manns et al., 2007; Howard and Kahana, 2002, and others) are not included here and standard analysis methods (detailed comparison of firing during immobility and across the two environments) are not performed."

In fact, many well performed electrophysiology studies report the fraction of cells that are place cells compared to those that are only observed during immobility. A much more detailed analysis of the firing patterns of non-place cells within and across environments is needed before any conclusions about their contribution to stability over time can be drawn."

It is of course expected that correlations within environments are higher than between environments but the key question is the extent of the neuronal coding difference for the two environments. From the information that is currently provided it appears that A and B are partially correlated and that each environment is more correlated with itself from at temporally proximal compared to temporally distant time points. If A and B and A and A' are correlated, is appears trivial that B and A' are also correlated, and all classifiers and conclusions seem to be based on this finding."

In the previous study they showed significant changes to the place cell representation of a single environment over ~35 days primarily due to continual changes to the subset of cells that were active (using GCaMP3 as the indicator). In particular, a cell that was active on a given day was less and less likely to be active in the same environment over several weeks of time. However, they also showed that if a cell was active at different time points within this ~35 day period that their place fields were in the same location, indicating stability of the spatial representation in that sense. Given the amount of change they observed in the representation, it is important to know to what extent this amount of change may affect how spatial memories can be recalled over the long term. One way to investigate this is to consider how the representations of two different environments could be distinguished over time, which is the experiment presented here. Here they show that while the activity levels (a graded version of the active/inactive distinction that Ziv et al. (2013) focused on) of individual cells changed over time, the representations of the environments were distinguishable from each other with a similar level of contrast at any given time point, indicating a similar magnitude of global remapping over time. They also showed that the activity levels of both environments changed gradually over time so that the amount of similarity in activity levels at different time points could be used to distinguish how far apart in time those experiences were. An important aspect of this last point was that the activity levels of the cells changed in a similar fashion for both environments, allowing them to determine when an experience occurred in a given environment by using the activity levels over time from either that or the other environment."

Both studies point out that there is significant change in the hippocampal representation over time. However, the GCaMP6 variants are more sensitive detectors of neural activity than GCaMP3, which detects strong bursts more than single spikes. Because models of memory can depend on parameter values such as how stable activity is over time, it would be very valuable for the hippocampal field to have a quantitative comparison between the key numbers from the previous GCaMP3-based study and the GCaMP6-based values here (especially since other differences in methodology are likely to be low due to overlap in the author lists). Therefore, the authors should quantitatively compare their data to Ziv et al. (2013) by adding to the current manuscript's supplementary figures the same plots corresponding to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, Figure 3B, and Figure 3C of Ziv et al. (2013).

As for Figure 3C in Ziv et al. (2013), the previous study used a binary distinction between active and inactive cells. The current manuscript's <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> uses a more graded activity level measure for cells. In the inset of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, does the \"overlap\" plot use exactly the same definition of active and inactive cells as Ziv et al. (2013) Figure 3C?

One complication in evaluating this latter question is the extent to which the authors focused on only the most recent literature and thus provided a narrow perspective of how their study fit into existing knowledge. Numerous earlier studies and models of how gradually changing neural representations could add a temporal dimension to memory are ignored. In addition, of the more recent work that is cited (e.g., Mankin et al., 2012), the authors do not clearly show how the present results differ from and thus add to the prior results (aside from the imaging technique used to obtain the data).

However, unlike previous studies, in this work we focused on the co-evolution of CA1 representations of different contexts. Until now it has not been explicitly demonstrated that CA1 neural codes can be both substantially different between contexts and yet co-evolve with time in a manner that allows the binding in memory of events that occurred at different contexts. In the revised manuscript we further substantiate that the CA1 representations of the two environments are highly distinct (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C, G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014 figure supplement 6</a>).

But what has remained unknown until our current study is the degree to which such days-scale evolution in the hippocampal CA1 representation of a given environment is independent from the evolution of the representations of other environments. We think this point is far from trivial: if the dynamics of the representations of different environments were independent, then different visits to the same environment would still be encoded as different traces; however, with such a coding scheme events that occurred at different environments but at temporal proximity will not be associated in long-term memory. Contrary to this scenario, our current work revealed that the representations of two different environments co-evolved with time, sufficing to infer the time in which events occurred in one environment using reference data from the other environment."

Our experimental design is very different: we pre-trained the mice for 8-11 days in both environments, before starting the two-week long imaging experiment, but did not examine the effects of gradual versus simultaneous introduction of the two environments on their representations or dynamics. Beyond this basic conceptual difference in study design, there are multiple additional differences between the studies that make a direct comparison between them difficult. For example, in Rangel et al., they recorded from the DG of rats whereas we recorded from the CA1 of mice. The DG and CA1 have different qualitative and functional differences. Rangel et al. pooled data from four days of recordings at the end of the training phase, whereas we recorded longitudinally over two weeks. They did not compare neuronal activity from the same animals at different intervals along the course of the experiment, whereas we did. In their experiments rats explored environments of different sizes, whereas in our experiments the environments were the same size.

To quantify whether non-place codes contained temporal information we analyzed the performance of the different time decoders, separately for periods in which the mouse was active versus stationary (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A-C</a>), and for place cells versus non-place cells (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4D-F</a>). Active periods were defined as times when the animal was at velocity <math id=\"inf32\"><mrow><mo>\u2265</mo><mn>1</mn><mtext>cm</mtext><mo>/</mo><mtext>sec</mtext></mrow></math> and located more than 8cm from either end of the track. Place cells were defined as cells with significant place coding in at least one session. <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a> now shows that: (1) Ca<sup>2+</sup> events taken from epochs in which the mouse was either active or stationary, and (2) place cells and non-place cells all carried significant temporal information. Thus, time stamping is not intrinsically linked to specific aspects of the episodic representation such as place coding."

Both studies point out that there is significant change in the hippocampal representation over time. However, the GCaMP6 variants are more sensitive detectors of neural activity than GCaMP3, which detects strong bursts more than single spikes. Because models of memory can depend on parameter values such as how stable activity is over time, it would be very valuable for the hippocampal field to have a quantitative comparison between the key numbers from the previous GCaMP3-based study and the GCaMP6-based values here (especially since other differences in methodology are likely to be low due to overlap in the author lists). Therefore, the authors should quantitatively compare their data to Ziv et al. (2013) by adding to the current manuscript's supplementary figures the same plots corresponding to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, Figure 3B, and Figure 3C of Ziv et al. (2013). It looks like one of these (the fraction of cells that are place cells) is already shown in both (Ziv et al., 2013 <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> that shows a place cell fraction of ~10-15% and this manuscript's <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a> shows a value of ~50%), but it's not clear that it has been computed in exactly the same way. As for Figure 3C in Ziv et al. (2013), the previous study used a binary distinction between active and inactive cells. The current manuscript's <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> uses a more graded activity level measure for cells. In the inset of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, does the \"overlap\" plot use exactly the same definition of active and inactive cells as Ziv et al. (2013) Figure 3C? Finally, the authors should show separate plots for GCaMP6s and for 6F, which could have different detectability for events.</i> "

(2013) for: (1) number of days that the cells were active in each environment, (2) fraction of place cells active during rightward and leftward movement in each environment, and (3) the changes in the ensemble activity correlations, or overlap, within and between environments. Please note that while we present here data that was analyzed as in Ziv et al. (2013), several other aspects of the current experiment (beyond the use of a more sensitive indicator) were different than the previous studies. For example, the interval between imaging days was five days in the previous study and two days in ours, which may account for some of the differences seen in the overlap between the place cell ensemble that were active on different days; in the previous work mice explored a single environment, whereas in the current study mice explored two different environments in each day of recording; both the length of the linear tracks and their distance from distal visual cues are longer in the current study, which may have contributed to some of the differences in the fraction of place cells, or the degree to which they are direction selective."

While the authors show that their global remapping score is stable over time, it looks like <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows some degree of increasing divergence even though Day 1 already represents ~2 weeks of familiarization with both environments.

(2002) and added two new analyses of the degree to which the representational difference between the two environments changes with time (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>). Due to the nature of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data, in which bursts of action potentials are often detected as single Ca<sup>2+</sup> excitation events and not as trains of spikes (as in electrophysiological recordings), it is hard to reliably evaluate a spatial activity map of single neurons based on a single 3-minute trial. By comparison, Lever et al. typically analyzed 8-10 minute trials. We therefore devised two scores: \u2018activity divergence\u2019 and \u2018peak displacement\u2019, which resemble Lever\u2019s \u2018rate divergence\u2019 and \u2018peak divergence\u2019 scores, but different in that they do not require the evaluation of firing map based on data from a single trial. Importantly, according to our new analyses the dynamics of neither of these scores changed over the time scale of the experiment."
