Based on the evidence that excessive alcohol consumption may be associated with an increased rate of de novo mutations in germ cells (sperms or eggs), we examine here whether the risks of autism and ADHD are increased among individuals with a family history of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of autism and ADHD among individuals with a biological parental history of AUDs were 1.39 (95% CI 1.34\u20131.44) and 2.19 (95% CI 2.15\u20132.23), respectively, compared to individuals without an affected parent. Among offspring whose parents were diagnosed with AUDs before their birth, the corresponding risks were 1.46 (95% CI 1.36\u20131.58) and 2.70 (95% CI 2.59\u20132.81), respectively. Our study calls for extra surveillance for children with a family history of AUDs, and further studies examining the underlying mechanisms are needed."

Based on the evidence that excessive alcohol consumption may be associated with an increased rate of de novo mutations in germ cells (sperms or eggs), we examine here whether the risks of autism and ADHD are increased among individuals with a family history of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of autism and ADHD among individuals with a biological parental history of AUDs were 1.39 (95% CI 1.34\u20131.44) and 2.19 (95% CI 2.15\u20132.23), respectively, compared to individuals without an affected parent. Among offspring whose parents were diagnosed with AUDs before their birth, the corresponding risks were 1.46 (95% CI 1.36\u20131.58) and 2.70 (95% CI 2.59\u20132.81), respectively. Our study calls for extra surveillance for children with a family history of AUDs, and further studies examining the underlying mechanisms are needed."

                        "text": "Autism is a neural development disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and verbal and non-verbal communication (<a href=\"#bib2\">Biederman and Faraone, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Levy et al., 2009</a>). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivity, resulting in functional impairment (<a href=\"#bib2\">Biederman and Faraone, 2005</a>). Autism and ADHD typically begin in childhood and often persist into adulthood (<a href=\"#bib2\">Biederman and Faraone, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Levy et al., 2009</a>). A recent study suggests that autism and ADHD share common genetic mutations (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013</a>), which may provide the genetic basis for the associations of the two disorders. The etiology of autism and ADHD is, however, largely unknown, although a few genetic and environmental factors have been suggested to be associated with their developments (<a href=\"#bib27\">Szpir, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Walsh et al., 2008</a>). Epidemiological studies suggest that the prevalence of both disorders is increasing (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fombonne, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Parner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boyle et al., 2011</a>), and that advanced parental age at the time of conception is associated with increased risk of autism (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kong et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Parner et al., 2012</a>). A subsequent study showed that the risk of autism was also higher in grandchildren with an older maternal grandmother compared to those with a younger one (<a href=\"#bib12\">Golding et al., 2010</a>). In addition, twin studies showed that the concordance rate for autism is much higher in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nordenbaek et al., 2013</a>), suggesting de novo mutations may partly explain the development of autism (<a href=\"#bib6\">Callaway, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kong et al., 2012</a>). Previous studies found that a number of de novo mutations and epigenetic modifications in germ cells could lead to increased rates of autism, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders (<a href=\"#bib21\">Malaspina, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fombonne, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boyle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Callaway, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kong et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Parner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gratten et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Zaidi et al., 2013</a>). It is thus important to identify potential environmental factors that contribute to the increased rate of de novo mutations and/or epigenetic modifications in the parents (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kinney et al., 2010</a>). We assume that excessive alcohol consumption may be associated with an increased rate of de novo mutations in germ cells (sperms or eggs), because previous studies showed that exposures to alcohol could lead to increased rates of mutations in germ cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Narod et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Yamauchi et al., 2012</a>). It is thus necessary to examine whether the risks of autism and ADHD are increased among individuals with a family history of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). In addition, we examined the offspring risks of autism and ADHD when their adoptive parents were diagnosed with AUDs to disentangle the potential contribution of high levels of psychological tension and stress in AUD families."

The incidence rates of autism and ADHD were somewhat more pronounced when the diagnosis of AUDs in parents occurred before the birth of their offspring. The time-relationship supports that the observed association between parental AUDs and autism and ADHD in offspring may be causal. In addition, we studied the incidence among adoptees to disentangle the contribution by environmental factors. However, we could not draw definite conclusions from these results, as the cases were very few among adoptees with an affected adoptive parent. The PAF was 3.6 and 11.0% for autism and ADHD, respectively, if excess alcohol consumption could be avoided in their parents."

                        "text": "There are a few possible biological explanations for the high observed risks of autism and ADHD among individuals with a family history of AUDs. Firstly, they could be explained by an increased rate of de novo mutations among individuals with AUDs, confirming our hypothesis. It should be noted that although a few de novo mutations have been found to be related to autism (<a href=\"#bib6\">Callaway, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kong et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Zaidi et al., 2013</a>), associations with ADHD are still lacking, calling for more research to examine possible mutations among patients with ADHD. However, a recent study found that autism and ADHD share common genetic mutations (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013</a>), which may partly explain their associations with parental AUD. In addition, the increased risks of autism and ADHD may be related to epigenetic modifications of specific genes because exposure to alcohol can alter the methylation status in sperm cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Govorko et al., 2012</a>). How epigenetic modifications may affect the development of these disorders should, however, be examined in further studies. It should be noted that there might be common genetic predispositions linked to AUD, autism and ADHD. An additional explanation for the observed associations is that children of individuals with alcohol problems may face high levels of tension and stress at home, and that a stressful home environment may lead to communication problems, bad school performances, and, ultimately, to the development of autism and ADHD (<a href=\"#bib1\">Berger, 1993</a>). However, our study found that the risk of autism and ADHD was increased only when the biological parents were diagnosed with AUDs, suggesting that genes as well as a stressful home environment have an impact on the increased risk of autism and ADHD."

It is known that alcohol can be carried to the placenta and that the concentration of alcohol in the unborn baby's bloodstream is the same as that in the mother. Mothers who consume alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to a baby with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). In general, the more severe the mother's drinking problem is during pregnancy, the more severe are the symptoms of FAS in infants (<a href=\"#bib17\">Landgren et al., 2010</a>). Children with FAS may be diagnosed with autism or ADHD because these conditions are all characterized by an impaired quality of social interaction (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bishop et al., 2007</a>)."

The primary health care register in Sk\u00e5ne (the southernmost province of Sweden), PASIS, contains data on individuals (around 1.2 million) who visited primary health care in Sk\u00e5ne between 1987 and 2010. The primary health care register in Stockholm covers 75 primary health care centers for the period 2001\u20132007. The Swedish Hospital Discharge Register was founded in 1964\u201365 by the National Board of Health and Welfare, and has had complete nationwide coverage since 1987. The Outpatient Register contains data on all visits to outpatient clinics in Sweden since 2001. A recent external review suggested that the overall accuracy of the Swedish Hospital Registry is approximately 85\u201395% (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ludvigsson et al., 2011</a>). Individuals with autism were identified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 code 299B and ICD-10 code F840). Individuals with ADHD were identified according to ICD-9 code 314 and ICD-10 code F90."

The Multi-Generation Register contains data on more than 3.2 million families and 12 million individuals. In addition, we identified 22,996 individuals who were born after 1950 and had been adopted, with information available on both adoptive parents and at least one biological parent. Adoptees adopted by biological relatives or by an adoptive parent living with a biological parent were excluded. Diagnoses of AUDs in parents (biological or adoptive) were identified from three national registries, including the Hospital Discharge and Outpatient Registers using the ICD-9 (291A\u2013291F, 291W, 291X, 303, 305A) and ICD-10 codes (F10), the Crime Register (which contains data on individuals who committed AUD-related crimes in 1973\u20132007), and the Swedish Pharmacy Register (2005\u20132010). Data from the latter were based on prescriptions of disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate. Using these three sources, we identified 420,489 unique individuals with AUDs (lifetime prevalence in Sweden of \u223c3.8%)."

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated as the ratio of the observed and expected numbers of cases (<a href=\"#bib5\">Breslow and Day, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Rothman and Greenland, 1998</a>). The expected number of cases was calculated according to the incidence rate for all individuals without a family history of AUDs. SIRs were standardized by 5-year age group, sex (male and female), 5-year time period, family history of autism or ADHD, and individual disposable income (<a href=\"#bib10\">Esteve et al., 1994</a>). 95% confidence intervals for the SIRs were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution, and were rounded to the nearest two decimals (<a href=\"#bib10\">Esteve et al., 1994</a>). The population attributable fraction (PAF) is the proportion of the disease burden in the population that could be prevented if exposure to a particular risk factor could be avoided (<a href=\"#bib8\">dos Santos Silva, 1999</a>). The calculation of PAF is based on a relative risk estimate. In this study, SIRs were used to calculate PAF as follows: PAF = proportion of autism and ADHD patients with a family history of AUD \u00d7 (SIR \u2212 1)/SIR. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)."
