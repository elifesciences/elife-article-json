A prominent example is the microtubule-dependent transport of mRNAs and associated ribosomes on endosomes. This coordinated process is crucial for correct septin filamentation and efficient growth of polarised cells, such as fungal hyphae. Despite detailed knowledge on the key RNA-binding protein and the molecular motors involved, it is unclear how mRNAs are connected to membranes during transport. Here, we identify a novel factor containing a FYVE zinc finger domain for interaction with endosomal lipids and a new PAM2-like domain required for interaction with the MLLE domain of the key RNA-binding protein. Consistently, loss of this FYVE domain protein leads to specific defects in mRNA, ribosome, and septin transport without affecting general functions of endosomes or their movement. Hence, this is the first endosomal component specific for mRNP trafficking uncovering a new mechanism to couple mRNPs to endosomes."

A prominent example is the microtubule-dependent transport of mRNAs and associated ribosomes on endosomes. This coordinated process is crucial for correct septin filamentation and efficient growth of polarised cells, such as fungal hyphae. Despite detailed knowledge on the key RNA-binding protein and the molecular motors involved, it is unclear how mRNAs are connected to membranes during transport. Here, we identify a novel factor containing a FYVE zinc finger domain for interaction with endosomal lipids and a new PAM2-like domain required for interaction with the MLLE domain of the key RNA-binding protein. Consistently, loss of this FYVE domain protein leads to specific defects in mRNA, ribosome, and septin transport without affecting general functions of endosomes or their movement. Hence, this is the first endosomal component specific for mRNP trafficking uncovering a new mechanism to couple mRNPs to endosomes."

For some proteins, this is achieved by transporting the mRNAs to the right location before they get translated, via a process called \u2018mRNA trafficking\u2019. However, mRNAs do not move by themselves; instead they bind to a host of mRNA-binding proteins, and the ribosomes that are required for translation to take place. Cells also move proteins between different locations using small bubble-like structures called vesicles. These vesicles are surrounded by a membrane, and so this process is known as \u2018membrane trafficking\u2019. Previous work has shown that these two processes are often linked, as vesicles can also carry mRNA molecules. But it is not fully understood how mRNA molecules are connected to vesicles."

This fungus uses these filaments to penetrate into plant tissues and causes a disease called corn smut. The experiments revealed a vesicle protein called Upa1 that contains a new type of binding site that allows Upa1 to bring an important RNA-binding protein to the surface of vesicles. Since the RNA-binding protein binds mRNA and the translating ribosomes, this can explain how mRNAs can associate with membranes to move together along hyphae."

Future studies could now investigate whether similar processes take place in other cells that grow as long filaments, such as plant pollen tubes or nerve cells. These studies might provide new insights into plant reproduction or brain activity."

This was achieved by homologous recombination at the <i>upa1</i> locus of strain AB33 resulting in wild-type expression levels to avoid artefacts due to overexpression. Control experiments revealed that the amount of Upa1-Gfp did not change during the switch from yeast to hyphal growth (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). To test PAM2 functionality, we generated Upa1 variants carrying a mutation in the PAM2 motif of Upa1 (Upa1<sup>mP</sup>-Gfp) or a deletion of an N-terminal part containing that motif (Upa1<sup>\u0394N1</sup>-Gfp; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Instead, the Rrm4-interacting region was mapped to the centre of Upa1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Moreover and also unexpectedly, an Upa1 variant without the central Rrm4-interacting region was still able to interact with Rrm4 (Upa1<sup>\u0394F</sup>-Gfp, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), suggesting the presence of two yet unknown interacting regions. Therefore, we performed a more detailed analysis of the central interaction region of Upa1 (position 886 to 1030), applying linker scanning mutagenesis with 10 amino acid block mutations. Only a mutation in region 948 to 958 caused loss of binding (mutation 7 in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Interestingly, this region exhibited sequence similarity to the PAM2 motif (designated PAM2L, PAM2-like; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), and furthermore, a second PAM2L sequence was found in the N-terminus of Upa1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) supporting the initial two-hybrid data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Mutating the conserved five amino acid core EFxxP or the highly conserved phenylalanine residue alone confirmed that these amino acids in both PAM2L motifs are crucial for the interaction with Rrm4 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A phylogenetic analysis of Upa1 revealed that both PAM2L sequences are conserved in related fungal proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Thus, Upa1 interacts with Pab1 and Rrm4 via similar but not identical motifs, and a single PAM2L motif is sufficient for interaction."

Furthermore, we verified the observations performing GST co-purification experiments using protein variants expressed in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The results were consistent with the mapping analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) showing that the MLLE-containing regions of Rrm4 and Pab1 exclusively recognise the corresponding PAM2L and PAM2 motifs, respectively. Importantly, we addressed whether the PAM2L motifs are also needed for Upa1 function during hyphal growth. To this end, we generated strains expressing Upa1-Gfp versions carrying mutations in the PAM2L motifs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Scoring unipolar growth and secretion of Cts1 revealed consistent results leading to the conclusion that one PAM2L motif is sufficient for function, but if both are mutated functionality of Upa1 is lost. Additional mutations in the PAM2 motif made no difference indicating that it is the PAM2L motifs that are indeed crucial for activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013H</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7</a>).

Rab5a-Cherry localises to shuttling endosomes and exhibits additional staining in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>), which most likely marks the endomembrane system proposed to be late endosomes involved in endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Higuchi et al., 2014</a>). Dynamic co-localisation experiments using dual view technology and msALEX microscopy (millisecond alternating laser excitation, <a href=\"#bib4\">Baumann et al., 2014</a>) revealed that Upa1-Gfp co-localises extensively with motile Rab5a-positive endosomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; about 90% percent in both directions). A second marker for this motile endosomal compartment is Rrm4, which in contrast to Rab5a does not stain other membrane compartments. Consistently, the vast majority of Upa1-Gfp signals co-localises with Rrm4-Rfp (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#media13\">Video 13</a>, about 90% percent in both directions).

This is mainly based on the observation that the styryl dye FM4-64 follows the endocytotic pathway by initially staining the plasma membrane followed by staining Rab5a-positive shuttling endosomes and lastly vacuoles (<a href=\"#bib24\">Higuchi et al., 2014</a>). Testing endocytotic uptake of FM4-64 revealed no differences in the uptake and labelling of shuttling endosomes when comparing wild-type and <i>upa1\u0394</i> strains (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), suggesting that Upa1 is not involved in endocytosis. Next, we tested the shuttling of Rab5a-Gfp in hyphae comparing wild-type and <i>upa1\u0394</i> strains. This showed neither a difference in the velocity of Rab5a-Gfp-positive endosomes nor in the bidirectional movement of Rab5a (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>; <a href=\"#media14\">Videos 14</a>,<a href=\"#media15\">15</a>).

Although the velocity of processive Rrm4-Gfp signals is the same as in wild type (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), in the absence of Upa1, we observed fewer processive signals and a significant increase in signals exhibiting corralled movement (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013G</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>; <a href=\"#media16\">Videos 16</a>,<a href=\"#media17\">17</a>). This altered movement was particularly eminent when quantifying processive signals reaching the apical region of hyphal tips (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). This suggests that endosome association of Rrm4 was impaired. Analysing the altered movement of Rrm4 revealed that it was still microtubule-dependent (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). The decline in processive Rrm4-Gfp signals was not due to a reduced protein amount, since expression is comparable in wild-type and <i>upa1\u0394</i> strains (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Importantly, the processive Rrm4-Gfp signals co-localised with Rab5a and the endosomal marker protein Yup1, as well as with the lipophilic dye FM4-64. These co-localisation studies confirm that Rrm4 movement was specifically altered in the absence of Upa1 and that residual processive movement took place on endosomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I\u2013J</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Rrm4-Gfp signals exhibiting corralled movement did not co-localise with the membrane markers used, suggesting that these large accumulations constitute aberrant forms that fail to associate with the machinery for long-distance transport. Furthermore, addressing the endosomal shuttling of Upa1-Gfp in the absence of Rrm4 revealed that Upa1-Gfp movement is indistinguishable from wild type, suggesting that Upa1 attaches to endosomes independently of Rrm4 (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>). In summary, Upa1 is dispensable for general endosomal functions but is crucial for endosomal recruitment of Rrm4."

To address whether these functions are altered in the absence of Upa1, we first studied the movement of Pab1-Gfp, which is an established marker for mRNA (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baumann et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2014</a>). In contrast to wild type, the number of Pab1-Gfp-positive, processive signals reaching the apical pole was strongly reduced in the <i>upa1\u0394</i> strain, even though the protein level in both strains are comparable (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>; <a href=\"#media18\">Videos 18</a>,<a href=\"#media19\">19</a>). The processive signals exhibited the same velocity in wild type and <i>upa1\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>) indicating that the transport machinery itself is not affected whereas the loading of the mRNA cargo to endosomes is (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>).

Endosomal movement of ribosomal proteins was visualised by bleaching an area about 10 \u03bcm from the hyphal tip followed by video microscopy (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baumann et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013G</a>). Rps2-Gfp, Rpl25-Gfp, and Rps19-Gfp exhibited bidirectional movement in shuttling units (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013G</a>), which were previously shown to be Rrm4-positive endosomes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baumann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Higuchi et al., 2014</a>). Note, that whereas Rps2-Gfp and Rpl25-Gfp were expressed ectopically, Rps19-Gfp was expressed at the homologous locus under control of the endogenous promoter resulting in stronger signals. Loss of Upa1 caused a severe reduction in shuttling signals (analysing five hyphae each revealed 42, 47, and 78 processive signals in Rps2-Gfp, Rpl25-Gfp, and Rps19-Gfp in wild type but 0, 1, 5 in <i>upa1\u0394</i> strains, respectively). Thus, in the absence of Upa1, Rrm4 functions such as transport of mRNAs and associated ribosomes are disturbed."

Thus, without Upa1, hardly any Cdc3 protein could be detected on endosomes. Also the subcellular localisation of Cdc3-Gfp in septin filaments was altered in <i>upa1\u0394</i> strains. Similar to <i>rrm4\u0394</i> strains, septin filaments were still formed, but the gradient at the hyphal tip was lost (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). To verify that the disturbed formation of septin filaments correlated with altered endosomal delivery of septin protein in the absence of Upa1, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments to analyse hyphal tips (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baumann et al., 2014</a>). Due to the long maturation time of Gfp in the order of several minutes, local translation of newly synthesised protein at the hyphal tip can be excluded <a href=\"#bib4\">Baumann et al., 2014</a>). Using the identical set-up as described before (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baumann et al., 2014</a>), we determined a half time of recovery (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of 4.2 min for wild-type hyphae (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>).

The latter is a wide-spread protein\u2013protein interaction motif of about 30 amino acids in length found in the human cytoskeletal protein Ankyrin (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mosavi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 2006</a>). Unfortunately, the ankyrin repeats in Upa1 escaped our analysis because of the instability of protein variants lacking the repeats (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). PAM2 motifs are found in a number of interaction partners of the mammalian protein PABPC1, such as translational initiation factor eRF3, nuclease subunit Pan3 and miRNA regulator GW182 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hoshino et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Uchida et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tritschler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zekri et al., 2013</a>). Structural and functional analysis revealed a conserved core motif (consensus xxLNxxAxEFxP; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kozlov et al., 2010</a>), which is inserted in the peptide-binding pocket of the MLLE domain (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albrecht and Lengauer, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kozlov et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jinek et al., 2010</a>). In Upa1, this motif is necessary and sufficient for interaction with the MLLE domain of Pab1, confirming its bioinformatic identification. However, to our surprise the PAM2 motif is dispensable for Upa1 function, which could be explained with a redundant Pab1 interaction domain. Such a scenario was already described during miRNA regulation in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. The key factor GW182 interacts with PABPC1 via two regions, the PAM2 sequence and a second region that provides indirect interaction with PABPC1. Due to these redundant binding modes, the PAM2 motif of GW182 is functionally dispensable for PABP binding and silencing in <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eulalio et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Huntzinger et al., 2010</a>)."

Note, that mutations in the phenylalanine of both PAM2-like sequences in Upa1 resulted in loss of Rrm4 interaction (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A phylogenetic sequence comparison revealed that closely related basidiomycetes, which contain an Rrm4 homologue with MLLE domain, also possess Upa1 homologues with at least one of the two PAM2L motifs (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Experimentally, we found that although both RNA-binding proteins, Pab1 and Rrm4, contain similar MLLE domains (<a href=\"#bib8\">Becht et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), they apparently differ in their sequence specificity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>).

These observations all point toward the conclusion that Upa1 has a specific function in endosomal targeting of Rrm4 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). In the absence of Upa1, endosomal Rrm4 functions are disturbed, and consequently, mRNA and associated ribosomes are transported less efficiently. In line with this, specific functions of Rrm4 in septin mRNA and protein transport are also affected, overall leading to characteristic defects of hyphal functions, such as unipolar growth and Cts1 secretion. Thus, Upa1 is a key factor in endosomal recruitment of Rrm4. However, since endosomal movement of Rrm4 was not completely abolished in the absence of Upa1, we envision the presence of additional factors involved (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Noteworthy, the observed defects in Rrm4 function are fully consistent with our earlier model that Rrm4 mediates local translation of transported mRNAs for the endosomal transport of the translation products (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baumann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jansen et al., 2014</a>)."

Prominent examples are actin-dependent co-transport of mRNAs and ER during budding in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schmid et al., 2006</a>), endosomal transport of viral RNA (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ghoujal et al., 2012</a>) or endosomal miRNA-dependent processes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). In this respect, one of the key questions is how mRNPs are connected to membranes. Mammalian p180, for example, contains a lysine-rich RNA-binding domain in concert with a membrane spanning domain and thereby attaches mRNAs to the surface of ER membranes to support their local translation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cui et al., 2012</a>). She2p from yeast harbours a lipid-binding domain and is able to recognise membrane curvature supporting specific ER association of mRNAs during their transport to daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Genz et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, neuronal PICK1 contains a banana-shaped BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs) domain for interaction with curved membranes. Recently, it was shown that this endosome-associated factor specifically interacts with Argonaute 2, a core component of the miRNA machinery. This provides a mechanism of how miRNAs can be attached to endosomes to carry out specific functions, such as miRNA assembly or translational regulation in neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Antoniou et al., 2014</a>)."

Videos were recorded with an exposure time of 200 ms and 150 frames taken. Kymographs were generated from these videos and analysed using Metamorph (Version 7.7.0.0; Molecular Devices, Seattle, IL, USA). Signals were counted manually discriminating between processive movement, corralled movement (covered distance of hypha per 22.5 s &lt; 5 \u03bcm; rapid changes of direction), or static signals (no movement, straight line). Velocity was determined by quantifying processive signals (movement &gt;5 \u03bcm). Note that one signal could exhibit different speeds (i.e., upon reversal of direction). Those velocities were handled as individual data points and not averaged. Passing events were quantified at two defined regions: 10 \u03bcm from the apical tip or in the middle of the filament. The number of passing events reflects the overall crossing of signals through this zone. All parts of the microscope systems were controlled by the software package MetaMorph (version 7; Molecular Devices), which was also used for image processing including the adjustment of brightness and contrast, as well as measurements, quantifications, kymographs, and maximum projections of z-stacks. Fluorescence micrographs are displayed inverted unless otherwise stated."

Firstly, the interaction of Rrm4 with Upa1 is functionally significant and therefore more relevant than the interaction of Pab1 with Upa1 (see below). Secondly, in comparison to Rrm4, Pab1 is more difficult to detect mainly because of the extensive cytoplasmic localisation resulting in higher background signals (see <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 2B-C</a>). Hence, we generated strains expressing Rrm4-Gfp with either of the two endosomal markers Rab5a-Cherry or Yup1-Cherry. In both genetic backgrounds we furthermore deleted <i>upa1</i> in order to analyse the consequences caused by a loss of Upa1 function. These strains allowed simultaneous detection of both proteins as well as addressing their dynamic movement (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I-J</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 4A</a>). Moreover, we stained wild-type and <i>upa1\u0394</i> strains with the lipophilic dye FM4-64 to analyse membrane trafficking (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 4B</a>). We confirm by these co-localisation studies that Rrm4 movement is indeed specifically disturbed in <i>upa1\u0394</i> strains, while Rab5a and Yup1 movement remains unaffected.

Firstly, in principle it is possible that the disturbed interaction of Rrm4 with Upa1 alters the RNA-binding capacity of Rrm4. Therefore, although Rrm4 is still shuttling it may bind less mRNA and hence we observe less Pab1 and less ribosomal proteins. Secondly, the difference might be due to the different detection levels. Rrm4 is very specific for endosomes, in fact in wild-type cells we hardly observed any Rrm4 signal that is not co-localising with endosomes. However, Pab1 and ribosomal proteins are bound to almost all mRNAs in the whole cytoplasm. Therefore, as mentioned above the cytoplasmic signal is higher and endosomal movement more difficult to detect. This is particularly true for ribosomal proteins. Here, we need to bleach an area in the cytoplasm in order to detect ribosomes on shuttling endosomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Thus, it is more difficult to detect the residual movement of ribosomal proteins and Pab1 in the absence of Upa1."

All Upa1 versions localised to shuttling endosomes with comparable signal intensity indicating their expression at comparable levels (<a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 7C-D</a>). Testing unipolar growth (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>) and Cts1 secretion (<a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 7B</a>) gave consistent results. One PAM2L motif is sufficient for function, but if both PAM2L motifs were mutated Upa1 functionality was lost. The PAM2 motif did not contribute to these defects.

In addition, the septin Cdc3-Gfp forms filaments with a gradient emanating from the hyphal tip (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). In the absence of Rrm4, endosomal localisation of septin mRNA and septin protein is severely disturbed. Without Rrm4 and thus without mRNA transport Cdc3-Gfp stills forms filaments that localise to the hyphal tip while the gradient is no longer formed. Thus, without mRNA transport the efficient assembly of Cdc3G in filaments is affected. This is supported by FRAP experiments showing that in the absence of mRNA transport the recovery of Cdc3-Gfp is significantly delayed."
