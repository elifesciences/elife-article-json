To identify the neural substrate for these debilitating disorders, we induced both tinnitus and hyperacusis with an ototoxic drug (salicylate) and used behavioral, electrophysiological, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to identify the tinnitus\u2013hyperacusis network. Salicylate depressed the neural output of the cochlea, but vigorously amplified sound-evoked neural responses in the amygdala, medial geniculate, and auditory cortex. Resting-state fMRI revealed hyperactivity in an auditory network composed of inferior colliculus, medial geniculate, and auditory cortex with side branches to cerebellum, amygdala, and reticular formation. Functional connectivity revealed enhanced coupling within the auditory network and segments of the auditory network and cerebellum, reticular formation, amygdala, and hippocampus. A testable model accounting for distress, arousal, and gating of tinnitus and hyperacusis is proposed."

To identify the neural substrate for these debilitating disorders, we induced both tinnitus and hyperacusis with an ototoxic drug (salicylate) and used behavioral, electrophysiological, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to identify the tinnitus\u2013hyperacusis network. Salicylate depressed the neural output of the cochlea, but vigorously amplified sound-evoked neural responses in the amygdala, medial geniculate, and auditory cortex. Resting-state fMRI revealed hyperactivity in an auditory network composed of inferior colliculus, medial geniculate, and auditory cortex with side branches to cerebellum, amygdala, and reticular formation. Functional connectivity revealed enhanced coupling within the auditory network and segments of the auditory network and cerebellum, reticular formation, amygdala, and hippocampus. A testable model accounting for distress, arousal, and gating of tinnitus and hyperacusis is proposed."

The rats were also trained to expect a food pellet from their right if they heard nothing at all. Shortly after receiving the drug, the rats often failed to respond correctly in the \u2018quiet tests\u2019 and behaved like they were already experiencing a constant buzzing sound, as would be expected if they had tinnitus.

Roughly 12% of adults experience tinnitus, but the prevalence skyrockets to 50% in young combat personnel (<a href=\"#bib44\">Leske, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andersson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cave et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Michikawa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hebert et al., 2013</a>). Tinnitus is costly with more than $2 billion paid annually in veteran disability payments. Hyperacusis affects roughly 9% of adults (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersson et al., 2002</a>), but its prevalence is likely higher because of the difficulty of self-diagnosis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gu et al., 2010</a>). Remarkably, among those whose primary complaint is hyperacusis, 90% also suffer from tinnitus (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baguley, 2003</a>). Since tinnitus and hyperacusis are often triggered by cochlear hearing loss, it was long assumed that these auditory distortions resulted from hyperactivity disorders in the peripheral auditory nerve. This hypothesis, however, is contradicted by studies showing that auditory nerve spontaneous and sound-evoked firing rates are depressed in subjects with cochlear damage (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kiang et al., 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Wang et al., 1997</a>). Moreover, surgical section of the auditory nerve fails to eliminate tinnitus (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baguley et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lockwood et al., 2001</a>). These negative results plus recent imaging studies now suggest that tinnitus and hyperacusis arise from maladaptive neuroplastic change in the central nervous system (CNS) provoked by cochlear pathology (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lockwood et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Husain et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Sereda et al., 2011</a>)."

Most of these conceptual models have emerged from human imaging studies using magnetoencephalography, electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and functional MRI (fMRI) of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response (<a href=\"#bib46\">Llinas et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Weisz et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Auer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Moazami-Goudarzi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Leaver et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Maudoux et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Husain and Schmidt, 2014</a>). In the context of central gain models, some human imaging data indicate that hyperacusis is associated with enhanced sound-evoked activity in multiple-auditory processing centers, namely auditory cortex (ACx), medial geniculate body (MGB), and inferior colliculus (IC), whereas tinnitus can be triggered solely by enhanced central gain in the ACx (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gu et al., 2010</a>). On the other hand, active loudness models suggest that tinnitus arises entirely from increased central noise independent of gain, whereas hyperacusis results exclusively from increased nonlinear gain that results in loudness intolerance (<a href=\"#bib90\">Zeng, 2013</a>)."

Some discrepancies are likely due to confounding factors such as patient heterogeneity, unknown etiology, genetic diversity, social and environmental factors, and duration or severity of tinnitus and hyperacusis. Animal models could potentially overcome many of these limitations provided that tinnitus and hyperacusis can be reliably induced, behaviorally measured, and functionally imaged. While tinnitus can develop in some individuals after intense noise exposure, the percentage of affected individuals is highly variable and its duration is unpredictable (<a href=\"#bib29\">Heffner and Harrington, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lobarinas et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Heffner, 2011</a>). High doses of aspirin, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, have long been known to consistently induce acute tinnitus in humans and animals (<a href=\"#bib60\">Myers and Bernstein, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Myers et al., 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Mongan et al., 1973</a>). Moreover, high-dose sodium salicylate (SS), the active ingredient in aspirin, not only consistently induces tinnitus (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jastreboff et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lobarinas et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Stolzberg et al., 2013</a>), but also hyperacusis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hayes et al., 2014</a>); these perceptual disorders disappear a day or two post-treatment. The highly predictable time course of SS-induced tinnitus and hyperacusis makes it an extremely powerful tool for studying the neural correlates of these perceptual disturbances. Therefore, we took advantage of our unique behavioral techniques for assessing SS-induced tinnitus and hyperacusis in rats and combined this with focused electrophysiological measurements plus global fMRI assessment techniques to map out the regions of neural hyperactivity and enhanced FC that characterize the tinnitus\u2013hyperacusis network. To identify regions of heightened or depressed spontaneous neural activity, we measured the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in resting-state fMRI (<a href=\"#bib89\">Zang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Yao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Wen et al., 2013</a>) and combined this with resting-state FC to identify regions of increased or decreased functional coupling between regions of the auditory pathway and other parts of the CNS. This is the first animal study to use ALFF and FC combined with detailed electrophysiological measures to provide a comprehensive neurological map of the tinnitus\u2013hyperacusis network."

To quantify the effects, CAP amplitude-intensity functions were measured before and 2 hr post-SS. The mean (+SEM) CAP amplitude-intensity function (average of 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, and 40 kHz) measured 2 hr after SS treatment was shifted to the right at low intensities due to a threshold shift of approximately 20 dB (horizontal arrow, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In addition, the amplitude of the CAP was greatly reduced (70\u201380%) at suprathreshold intensities (down arrow, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) indicating a profound reduction in the neural output of the cochlea. LFP amplitude-intensity functions were also recorded from the MGB, ACx, and LA before and 2 hr after SS treatment. The LFP amplitude-intensity functions from all three structures were shifted to the right approximately 20 dB (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>) 2 hr post-SS consistent with the CAP. These results indicate that the threshold shift measured in central structures is largely determined by the loss of sensitivity at the cochlea. LFP amplitudes in the MGB, ACx, and LA increased rapidly with increasing intensity, and response amplitudes became substantially larger than pre-treatment values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>) in contrast to the large CAP amplitude reductions (\u223c70% decrease) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The SS-induced enhancement of suprathreshold LFP amplitudes at 100 dB SPL was approximately 50% in the MGB and 140% in the ACx, results indicative of a progressive increase in gain from peripheral to more central auditory loci (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nore\u00f1a, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lu et al., 2011</a>)."

The same amount of threshold shift occurred at higher levels of the auditory pathway indicating that the SS-induced hearing loss originates in the cochlea and is relayed centrally. SS also reduced the CAP neural output by \u223c70% at suprathreshold intensities. Paradoxically, suprathreshold LFP amplitudes in the MGB, ACx, and LA were larger than normal despite the massive reduction in the output of the cochlea (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). These provocative findings provide compelling evidence for an increase in central gain, a form of homeostatic plasticity implicated in tinnitus and hyperacusis (<a href=\"#bib70\">Salvi et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Auerbach et al., 2014</a>). The enhanced LFPs seen in ACx are consistent with the enhanced fMRI response observed in the ACx of tinnitus patients, whereas the enhanced LFPs seen in both ACx and MGB are consistent with the enhanced fMRI responses observed these regions in hyperacusis patients (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gu et al., 2010</a>). These results are consistent with previous models and data linking tinnitus and loudness intolerance to increased central gain in the central auditory pathway in particular regions from the IC to ACx (<a href=\"#bib70\">Salvi et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Qiu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Auerbach et al., 2014</a>). In some models, enhanced central gain amplifies central neural noise resulting in tinnitus (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nore\u00f1a, 2010</a>). However, in other models, central neural noise increases independent of central gain (<a href=\"#bib90\">Zeng, 2013</a>); this could potentially explain why some patients only experience tinnitus, but not hyperacusis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baguley, 2003</a>). However, this distinction is clouded by the fact that many tinnitus patients are unaware of their mild hyperacusis, that is, hyperacusis may be more prevalent in tinnitus patients than currently believed because many patients are unaware of their hyperacusis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gu et al., 2010</a>)."

In contrast, sound-evoked hyperactivity occurred at noticeably higher intensities for the LA (\u223c60 dB SPL), MGB (\u223c70 dB SPL), and acoustic-startle reflex amplitude (\u223c95 dB SPL). These results suggest that neural responses from the ACx may be one of the most sensitive biomarkers of hyperacusis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Juckel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gu et al., 2010</a>). However, since neural responses increased in magnitude from cochlea to cortex, loudness intolerance issues likely result from multiple stages of neural amplification as signals are relayed rostrally from the cochlea to the ACx (<a href=\"#bib4\">Auerbach et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, there is growing evidence that the neural amplification gradually develops in the auditory brainstem and serially accumulates to supernormal levels after reaching the MGB and ACx consistent with previous electrophysiological results (<a href=\"#bib68\">Qiu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Schaette and McAlpine, 2011</a>)."

SS either decreased or had no effect on spontaneous spike rate in primary ACx (<a href=\"#bib63\">Ochi and Eggermont, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Yang et al., 2007</a>) and reportedly no effect on synchrony between neuron pairs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eggermont, 2015</a>). Since the BOLD and LFP responses mainly represent presynaptic activity, it is difficult to directly relate our results to these spiking models. However, the increase in very low-frequency BOLD oscillations (0.01 Hz) represented by ALFF could be interpreted as evidence for increased presynaptic synchrony, which would likely enhance spike synchrony albeit at much longer time intervals than previously studied or over much larger neuronal populations than that reflected by spike correlations between neuron pairs. SS has also been found to increase gamma-band (50\u2013100 Hz) oscillatory activity in ACx (<a href=\"#bib75\">Stolzberg et al., 2013</a>); oscillations substantially higher than in ALFF. An alternative view is that the tinnitus percept is derived from coordinated activity among several auditory and nonauditory regions (<a href=\"#bib31\">Horwitz and Braun, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Husain et al., 2006</a>). Enhanced FC between the HIP and auditory areas provides a substrate for assigning a spatial location to a phantom sound, while coordinated activity between specific auditory areas and the reticular formation and AMY may draw attention to and add emotional significance to neural activity in the auditory pathway. Thus, functionally coordinated activity within the network may be essential for bringing tinnitus into consciousness."

Interestingly, the perception of tinnitus has been linked to activation of the PFL and vermis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brozoski et al., 2007a</a>) consistent with our results. Since ablation or inactivation of the PFL eliminates the perception of noise-induced tinnitus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bauer et al., 2013</a>), some have suggested that the PFL acts as a gain control mechanism comparing the afferent input from the cochlea with descending signals from the ACx (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bauer et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with this view, our results show that SS leads to hyperactivity in the ACx and increases the FC between the ACx and PFL and CB4. If this cerebellar-tinnitus gating hypothesis is correct, then ablating or inactivating the PFL should suppress behavioral measures of SS-induced tinnitus and possibly hyperacusis, providing a clear test of this model. The functional role of the PFL in tinnitus\u2013hyperacusis network could be further elucidated by inactivating the PFL and determining the effects this has on SS-induced changes we observed in our electrophysiological and fMRI measures."

In the resting state, SS enhanced the ALFF in the AMY and increased FC between ACx and AMY consistent with prior results showing increased coupling between ACx and AMY in tinnitus patients (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kim et al., 2012</a>) and increased c-fos immunolabeling in the AMY following SS treatment (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wallh\u00e4usser-Franke et al., 2003</a>). SS also enhanced sound-evoked activity in the AMY consistent with the increased activation seen in the AMY of hyperacusis patients (<a href=\"#bib45\">Levitin et al., 2003</a>). Importantly, infusion of SS directly into AMY increases sound-evoked activity in the ACx, effects that illustrate the potent independent role that the AMY can exert on central auditory function and aural perception (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). Collectively, these results reinforce the view that the AMY contributes to the fear and anxiety experienced by many patients with tinnitus and hyperacusis (<a href=\"#bib79\">van Veen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Juris et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aazh et al., 2014</a>). Sound and cognitive therapies aimed at reducing the emotional distress of tinnitus and hyperacusis would be expected to reduce the level of activity in the AMY and/or the functional coupling between the AMY and ACx without necessarily eliminating aberrant auditory percepts (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hazell and Jastreboff, 1990</a>). Human imaging studies employing ALFF and FC could be used to test this hypothesis and provide an objective and independent assessment of how these therapies work and their effects on the tinnitus\u2013hyperacusis neural network."

The reticular formation is an important arousal center with numerous inputs from the cochlear nucleus and IC (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kandler and Herbert, 1991</a>). Giant neurons in pontine reticular formation control the amplitude of the acoustic startle reflex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Koch et al., 1992</a>), and stimulation of the AMY enhances the response of these giant neurons (<a href=\"#bib41\">Koch et al., 1992</a>). Thus, the SS-induced increases of ALFF observed in the AMY and reticular formation likely contribute to the enhancement of the acoustic startle reflex."

However, after an extensive search, we were unable to find evidence of such aberrant somatosensory or visual phenomena. While the heightened ALFF response in these areas is novel, such changes seem reasonable, given the multisensory interactions known to exist between auditory, somatosensory, and visual areas. One possibility is that heightened ALFF activity in ACx, MGB, and IC could spill over and enhance activity in visual and somatosensory areas (<a href=\"#bib59\">Murray et al., 2005</a>). However, these increases may not lead to altered perception because FC was not enhanced in visual or somatosensory areas. Alternatively, the SS-induced cochlear loss could unmask pre-existing multisensory circuits in visual and somatosensory areas leading to increased activation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barone et al., 2013</a>)."

Although tinnitus and hyperacusis could conceivably arise from different mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib90\">Zeng, 2013</a>), they frequently co-occur more frequently than previously believed (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gu et al., 2010</a>). Tinnitus and hyperacusis do not exist in isolation but are linked to other brain regions associated with emotions, arousal, memories, spatial location, and motor activity as schematized in the tinnitus\u2013hyperacusis network model defined by our imaging results (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). With the seed region in IC, a significant increase in FC occurred in the MGB; this increase is likely due to the SS-induced enhancement of ALFF in the IC, which is relayed rostrally to the MGB (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, thick black line) resulting in a larger and more coherent MGB response. Similarly, with the seed in the MGB, increased FC occurred in the ACx; this increase is likely due to the increased ALFF and FC occurring in MGB, which is relayed rostrally to the ACx (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, thick black line). With the seed in the ACx, increased FC was seen in the same two lower auditory centers, the MGB and IC, raising the possibility of a recurrent feedback loop in this auditory subnetwork (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, shaded area, bidirectional dashed red lines). These data combined with our electrophysiological results suggest that SS enhances the FC and response magnitude in a central auditory subnetwork that extends from the IC through the MGB to the ACx."

The AC serves as a major hub with side branches to the amygdala (AMY), reticular nuclei (RN), and parafloccular lobe (PFL) and cerebellar lobules 4 (CB4); these side branch regions contribute to the emotional, motoric, and conscious awareness of tinnitus and/or hyperacusis.

The side branch connecting the ACx to the AMY provides a pathway through which emotional significance can be attached to tinnitus or hyperacusis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chen et al., 2014</a>) consistent with earlier studies linking anxiety, annoyance, and fear to tinnitus and hyperacusis (<a href=\"#bib57\">Moller, 2007</a>). The ACx-RN network provides a conduit by which increased arousal can increase awareness or attention, enhance motivation, or amplify motor responses to tinnitus or suprathreshold sounds (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carlson and Willott, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Paus, 2000</a>). The ACx-cerebellar branch could serve as a gating path for tinnitus (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boyen et al., 2014</a>) or modulate the motor responses to or perceptual salience of suprathreshold sounds thereby contributing to hyperacusis (<a href=\"#bib56\">Mobbs et al., 2007</a>). Increased FC between HIP-MGB and HIP-IC could facilitate the formation or stabilization of a memory trace for tinnitus, assign a spatial location to the phantom sound within or outside the head, or promote the retrieval of previously stored auditory memories (<a href=\"#bib19\">De Ridder et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Ulanovsky and Moss, 2008</a>). Our network model can be explicitly tested by administering a high-dose of SS while activating or inactivating part of the network, such as the PFL, and determining if the manipulation abolishes tinnitus or hyperacusis or alternatively determining how such manipulations affects the electrophysiological and fMRI properties of the network. Since high-dose SS is one of the most predictable and reliable inducers of tinnitus and hyperacusis, SS provides researchers with a powerful tool to gain mechanistic insights into the neurophysiological conditions needed to induce these debilitating auditory perceptions. Since SS-induced tinnitus and hyperacusis are transient phenomena that begin shortly after drug treatment, some of the neuro-pathophysiological changes we observed are likely to be similar to those that occur during the early stages of tinnitus or hyperacusis induced by acoustic trauma, Meniere's disease, or sudden hearing loss. In cases of acoustic overstimulation, most individuals develop transient tinnitus immediately post-exposure, which gradually disappears; interestingly only a small percentage develops permanent tinnitus (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gilles et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Degeest et al., 2014</a>). Thus, an important question that remains to be answered is whether the neural correlates of chronic tinnitus and hyperacusis are similar or different from the immediate and acute condition."

Seven food-restricted rats were trained to detect a broadband-noise burst (300 ms, 5 ms rise/fall) presented at intensities from 30 to 90 dB SPL. The rat initiated a trial by holding its nose in a nose-poke hole for 1\u20134 s until a noise-burst stimulus was presented.

Failure to respond during the 2-s response interval was scored as a \u2018miss\u2019 and not rewarded. Approximately, 30% of trials were catch trials (no stimulus). If the rat removed its nose on a catch trial (\u2018false alarm\u2019), the light in the test chamber was turned off and the rat received a 4-s timeout.

Three food-restricted rats (85\u201390% free feeding weight) were trained to nose-poke a center-hole to start a trial and then wait 4\u20138 s for a cue light to come on before responding in a bidirectional manner to one of three randomly presented ongoing stimuli. If an unmodulated narrow-band noise (NBN, 50% of trials) was present (4, 5, 6, 7, or 11 kHz center frequency, \u223c70 dB SPL), the rat was trained to nose-poke the left feeder to obtain a food pellet. In contrast, if an amplitude-modulated (AM, 30% of trials) narrow-band noise (100% modulation depth, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 11 kHz center frequency, \u223c70 dB SPL) or if no sound (Quiet, 20% of trials) was present, the rat was trained to nose-poke the right feeder to obtain a food pellet. During baseline testing, performance was typically greater than 80% correct. After reaching criterion, rats were treated either with SS or an equivalent volume of Saline and tested daily on the 2AFC paradigm for approximately 75 min beginning 2 hr post-treatment. Since the rats were trained to respond left to a steady NBN vs right to fluctuating AM noise or Quiet, we expected that if a rat developed SS-induced tinnitus, it would only shift its response on Quiet trials from the right side (associated with Quiet) to the left side (associated with a steady NBN) as previously discussed (<a href=\"#bib75\">Stolzberg et al., 2013</a>). Behavioral evidence of tinnitus was defined as a significant shift in behavior only on Quiet trials (percent correct below the 99% confidence interval established during baseline testing)."

Processing of the fMRI data was carried out with statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8, <a href=\"http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/\">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</a>) and Resting State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit V1.8 software (REST, <a href=\"http://www.restfmri.net\">http://www.restfmri.net</a>). Sequential data processing steps included: slice-timing adjustment, realignment and correction for head-motion, spatial normalization to the standard rat brain atlas (<a href=\"#bib66\">Paxinos and Watson, 2004</a>), smoothing with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 1 mm), detrending and filtering (0.01\u20130.1 Hz). Data were excluded if head movements exceeded 1.0 mm of maximum translation in the x, y, or z directions or 2.0 of maximum rotation about the three axes. Images for the ALFF analysis were band-pass filtered (0.01\u20130.1 Hz). Afterward, a fast Fourier transform was performed on the corrected time series data to obtain the power spectrum in each voxel within the brain; the square root of the power spectrum was calculated to obtain the amplitude at each frequency. To identify significant differences in ALFF values between the SS experimental group and the Saline control group, a between-group, two-sample t-test was calculated. Thresholds were set at a corrected p value of p &lt; 0.001 (cluster size &gt; 10 voxels) using the multiple comparison correction obtained with the AlphaSim method employing Monte Carlo simulation. Region of interest (ROI)-based FC analysis was performed for three auditory regions consisting of 9 voxels in the ACx, MGB, and IC. These regions were chosen based on the increased ALFF values observed in these areas during SS and because of their putative roles in tinnitus and hyperacusis. The mean time series for each of these three ROIs was computed for the reference time course. Cross-correlation analysis was then carried out between the mean signal change in each ROI and the time series of every voxel in the whole rat brain. Finally, a Fisher z-transform was applied to improve the normality of the correlation coefficients. Both motion parameters resulting from the realignment and the global signal time course were regressed out during this analysis to improve the specificity of the FC (<a href=\"#bib12\">B\u00fcchel et al., 1996</a>). For each ROI, two-sample t-tests were performed to identify significant changes in FC between the SS experimental group and the Saline control group. Thresholds were set at a corrected p value of p &lt; 0.001 (cluster size &gt; 10 voxels) using the multiple comparison correction obtained with the AlphaSim method employing Monte Carlo simulation."

The distinction between chronic and acute tinnitus and hyperacusis may not be as clear cut as these terms imply. Chronic tinnitus and hyperacusis sometimes disappears spontaneously or after therapy. On the other hand repeated episodes of acute noise-induced tinnitus can develop into long-lasting tinnitus and/or hyperacusis. One of the most puzzling aspects of tinnitus and hyperacusis induced by noise, aging or ototoxic drugs is why only a small proportion of hearing-impaired humans develop these debilitating symptoms while the majority does not. Salicylate has proved to be a powerful tool for consistently inducing both tinnitus and hyperacusis in humans and animals and for identifying the neural correlates of these disturbing auditory disorders."

All salicylate-treated rats develop both tinnitus and hyperacusis, not just one of these perceptual disorders. One group of rats was used to document that high dose salicylate induced tinnitus and a second group of rats was used to document that high dose salicylate induces hyperacusis. We have tried to make it clear throughout the revised manuscript that high dose salicylate induces both tinnitus and hyperacusis in all animals. Confusion may have occurred because one group of rats was used to demonstrate that high-dose salicylate reliably induced tinnitus and another group of rats was used to demonstrate that high-dose salicylate reliably induces hyperacusis. We used two separate groups of rats because it would be extremely difficult to train rats on two distinctly different behavioral paradigms. The two groups of behaviorally trained rats were tested at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, NY, USA. Another group of rats was used to obtain the electrophysiological data at the University at Buffalo. Finally, a fourth group of rats was used for the fMRI experiment conducted at Southeast University in Nanjing, China. The manuscript now clearly identifies these four groups."
