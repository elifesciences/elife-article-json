Here, we designed a flexible pipeline for the multi-scale reconstruction and quantitative morphological analysis of tissue architecture from microscopy images. Our pipeline includes newly developed algorithms that address specific challenges of thick dense tissue reconstruction. Our implementation allows for a flexible workflow, scalable to high-throughput analysis and applicable to various mammalian tissues. We applied it to the analysis of liver tissue and extracted quantitative parameters of sinusoids, bile canaliculi and cell shapes, recognizing different liver cell types with high accuracy. Using our platform, we uncovered an unexpected zonation pattern of hepatocytes with different size, nuclei and DNA content, thus revealing new features of liver tissue organization. The pipeline also proved effective to analyse lung and kidney tissue, demonstrating its generality and robustness."

Here, we designed a flexible pipeline for the multi-scale reconstruction and quantitative morphological analysis of tissue architecture from microscopy images. Our pipeline includes newly developed algorithms that address specific challenges of thick dense tissue reconstruction. Our implementation allows for a flexible workflow, scalable to high-throughput analysis and applicable to various mammalian tissues. We applied it to the analysis of liver tissue and extracted quantitative parameters of sinusoids, bile canaliculi and cell shapes, recognizing different liver cell types with high accuracy. Using our platform, we uncovered an unexpected zonation pattern of hepatocytes with different size, nuclei and DNA content, thus revealing new features of liver tissue organization. The pipeline also proved effective to analyse lung and kidney tissue, demonstrating its generality and robustness."

To be able to answer this question researchers need to use microscopy to observe the cells in a tissue, extract structural information from the images, and then generate three-dimensional digital models of the tissue. However, the software solutions that are currently available are limited, and reconstructing three-dimensional tissue from microscopy images remains problematic."

This information can then be used to develop quantitative functional models that describe and predict the system behaviour under perturbed conditions (<a href=\"#bib46\">Hunter et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Smith et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Fonseca et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Sbalzarini, 2013</a>). The development of such multi-scale models requires first a geometrical model of the tissue, that is, an accurate three-dimensional (3D) digital representation of the cells in the tissue as well as their critical subcellular components (<a href=\"#bib77\">Peng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Boehm et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Mayer et al., 2012</a>). This can be constructed from high-resolution microscopy images with multiple fluorescent markers, either fusion proteins or components detected by antibody staining. Since organelles can be as small as ~0.1 \u00b5m in size, the geometrical model has also to cover a wide range of scales spanning over three orders of magnitude. However, substantial limitations persist with respect to availability of markers, volume of tissue to reconstruct, scale of measurements, computational methods to perform the analysis and sample throughput. Although a few existing platforms provide standard tools for 3D segmentation and methods to process 2D surface layers of cells [ImageJ/Fiji (<a href=\"#bib36\">Girish and Vijayalakshmi, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Collins, 2007</a>), ICY (<a href=\"#bib20\">de Chaumont et al., 2012</a>) and MorphoGraphX (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015</a>)], the challenges posed by dense and thick tissue specimens require the development of new algorithms. Therefore, there is a demand for a platform that can provide the required set of methods for the reconstruction of multi-scale digital 3D geometrical models of mammalian tissues from confocal microscopy images."

For a meaningful model, it is necessary to properly identify the different cell types within the tissue but also to detect subcellular and extracellular structures, for example, nuclei, plasma membrane or cell cortex, extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell polarity. Automated morphological cell recognition is a possible way to reconstruct dense tissue with limited number of markers."

Validated fluorescent protein chimeras are not always available, especially in the appropriate combination of fluorescence emission spectral profiles. On the other hand, in dense tissues immunostaining is inhomogeneous due to restricted antibody penetration. The development of protocols that render tissues optically transparent and permeable to macromolecules without significantly compromising their general structure enables the imaging of relatively thick specimens (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chung and Deisseroth, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ke et al., 2013</a>). However, in the case of a densely packed tissue, for example, liver, homogeneous staining is still limited to a thickness of ~100\u00a0\u00b5m. Therefore, obtaining high-resolution data from large volumes of tissue (typically from 0.1\u00a0mm to a few centimetres) requires sectioning the sample into serial 100-\u00b5m-thick slices that are stained and imaged separately. Furthermore, the cutting process introduces artefacts, such as bending, uneven section surfaces and partial damage of tissue, that require corrections during tissue model reconstruction. Unfortunately, the publicly available generic image processing software is unable to deal with such problems."

As proof of principle, we tested the pipeline on the reconstruction of a geometrical model of liver tissue. We chose this particular tissue due to its utmost importance for basic research, medicine and pharmacology. In order to test the accuracy of the pipeline, we created a benchmark for the evaluation of dense tissue reconstruction algorithms comprising a set of realistic 3D images generated from the digital model of liver tissue. Furthermore, we applied the platform to the analysis of lung and kidney tissue, demonstrating its generality and robustness."

The liver is composed of functional units, the lobules. In each lobule, bile canaliculi and sinusoidal endothelial cells form two 3D networks between the portal vein (PV) and the central vein (CV). The bile canalicular (BC) network is formed by hepatocytes and transports the bile, whereas the sinusoidal endothelial network transports the blood. The liver tissue has a number of remarkable features. One is the zonation of metabolic functions due to the fact that the hepatocytes located in the vicinity of the PV do not have the same metabolic activities as the hepatocytes located near the CV (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kuntz and Kuntz, 2006</a>). Second, hepatocytes are remarkably heterogeneous in terms of number of nuclei (mono- and bi-nucleated) and ploidy (<a href=\"#bib60\">Martin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Guidotti et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Faggioli et al., 2011</a>).

First, we established a protocol for the preparation of tissue specimens for single- and double-photon confocal microscopy at different resolutions. To cover multiple scales from subcellular organelles to tissue spanning over three orders of magnitude, we used a 3D multi-resolution tissue image acquisition approach (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This consisted of imaging a tissue sample at low resolution (1\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0\u00d7 1 \u03bcm \u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0per voxel) and zooming on the parts of interest at high resolution (0.3 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.3 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.3 \u03bcm per voxel). Second, the multi-scale reconstruction of tissue architecture was obtained following the pipeline of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Briefly, (1) images were filtered using a novel Bayesian de-noising algorithm; (2) individual low-resolution images of each physical section were assembled in 3D mosaics; (3) tissue deformations caused by sample preparation were corrected; (4) large vessels were segmented; (5) the 3D mosaics of sections were combined in a full-scale low-resolution model; (6) high-resolution images were registered into the low-resolution one; (7) sinusoidal and BC networks as well as nuclei were segmented and, finally, (8) the different cell types were identified, classified and segmented. We used the geometrical model to provide a detailed and accurate quantitative description of liver tissue geometry, including the complexity of the sinusoidal and BC networks, hepatocyte size distribution, stellate and Kupffer cells distribution in the tissue. Additionally, our platform comprises a set of methods for the proper statistical analysis of different morphometric parameters of the tissue as well as their spatial variability (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

This proved to be absolutely essential to preserve the tissue architecture and the epitopes for immunostaining. Serial sections of fixed tissues were prepared at a thickness of 100 \u00b5m to maximize antibody penetration and limit laser light scattering. Liver sections were stained to visualize key subcellular and tissue structures, namely nuclei (DAPI), the apical surfaces of hepatocytes (CD13), the sinusoidal endothelial cells (Flk1) or ECM (Laminin and Fibronectin) and the cell cortex (F-actin stained by phalloidin). We tested various reagents and protocols to clear the liver tissue, such as glycerol and <a href=\"http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/88559\">2,2\u2032thiodiethanol\u00a0</a>(TDE), and found that SeeDB (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ke et al., 2013</a>) yielded the best results. Stained sections were imaged sequentially (generating Z-stacks) by one- and two-photon laser scanning confocal microscopy to maximize the number of fluorescent channels available. The same section was imaged twice, at low and high magnification, using 25\u00d7/0.8 and 63\u00d7/1.3 objectives, respectively. The first covers a large volume to reconstruct the whole lobule and the latter focuses on a small area to reconstruct the tissue at high\u00a0resolution. The registration of 3D high-resolution images within low-resolution ones provides tissue-scale context information that is essential for the interpretation of the data at the cellular and subcellular level."

To address this problem, we developed a new Bayesian de-noising algorithm that first makes a probabilistic estimation of the background and separates it from the foreground (see \u2018Methods\u2019). Subsequently, the estimated background and foreground signals are independently smoothed and summed to generate a new de-noised image (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We applied BFBD de-noising to both low- and high-resolution images. BFBD de-noising provides better results than the standard ones in the field, such as median filtering, Gauss low-pass filtering and anisotropic diffusion (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), but also outperforms (by quality and computational performance) other algorithms, known to be more elaborate, such as the \u2018Pure\u00a0Denoise\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Luisier et al., 2010</a>) and \u2018edge preserving de-noising and smoothing\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beck and Teboulle, 2009</a>) (see \u2018Methods\u2019)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

One of the most popular tools for image segmentation is global thresholding (<a href=\"#bib74\">Pal and Pal, 1993</a>). In particular, the maximum entropy approach has been widely applied to image reconstruction problems, including the segmentation of fluorescent microscopy images (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dima et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Pecot et al., 2012</a>). However, since 3D confocal images are usually heterogeneous in intensity due to staining unevenness and light scattering in the tissue (<a href=\"#bib52\">Lee and Bajcsy, 2006</a>), global thresholding approaches may produce segmentation artefacts. In contrast, local thresholding allows adjusting the segmentation threshold to the spatial variability. We applied the LME method to find segmentation thresholds in the de-noised images. For this, we split the 3D image into a set of cubes and calculated the maximum entropy segmentation threshold (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brink, 1996</a>) within each cube. The threshold values were tri-linearly interpolated to the entire 3D image."

The objects were moderately swollen and contained holes resulting from local uneven staining. We used standard approaches to close the holes by morphological operations (opening/closing), which unfortunately led to even higher overestimation of the diameter of thin structures, such as sinusoids and BC. To correct this, we extended the segmentation algorithm by including the following steps. We generated a triangulation mesh of the segmented surfaces by the cube marching algorithm (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lorensen and Cline, 1987</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Then, we tuned the active mesh so that the triangle mesh vertexes aligned to the maximum gradient of fluorescence intensity in the original image (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Finally, we generated a representation of the skeletonized image via a 3D\u00a0graph describing the geometrical and topological features of the BC and sinusoidal networks. The reconstruction of sinusoidal and BC networks are shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, respectively."

However, as shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>, closely packed nuclei are optically not well-resolved in 3D confocal images, resulting in artificially merged structures. Since 30\u201360% (depending on the animal strain and age) of hepatocytes in adult liver are bi-nucleated, artificial nuclei merging compromises the tissue analysis. To address this problem, we used a probabilistic algorithm for double- and multi-nuclei splitting (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Briefly, the algorithm first discriminated between mono-, double and multi-nuclear structures by learning the misfit distribution of triangulation mesh and nuclei approximation by single and double ellipsoids (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013G</a>). Then, the seed points for the multi-nuclear structures were detected using the Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) scale-space maximum intensity projection (<a href=\"#bib86\">Stegmaier et al., 2014</a>) and, finally, the real nuclear shapes were found using an active mesh expansion starting from the nuclei seeds (see \u2018Methods\u2019 for details). Tested in both synthetic and real 3D images, the algorithm proved capable of splitting clustered nuclei with different degrees of overlap (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1K</a>) with an accuracy of over 90%. Although this approach is based on active triangulation mesh, it achieved similar accuracy values to other recently published voxel-based methods for nuclei segmentation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amat et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chittajallu et al., 2015</a>)."

A previous automated classification system discriminated hepatocytes from non-parenchymal cells in 2D human liver images with a 97.8% accuracy (<a href=\"#bib71\">O'Gorman et al., 1985</a>). However, the automatic classification of non-parenchymal cells in 3D liver tissue is more challenging. Given their importance in physiology and disease (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bouwens et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Kmiec, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Malik et al., 2002</a>) and the limitation on the number of fluorescent markers that can be simultaneously imaged, we designed an algorithm to automatically classify different cell types in the tissue based on nuclear morphological features. We chose two deterministic supervised classifiers, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Bayesian network classifier (BNC). LDA, also known as Fisher LDA (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fisher, 1936</a>), is a fundamental and widely used technique to classify data into several mutually exclusive groups (<a href=\"#bib23\">Duda et al., 2001</a>). It has been successfully applied for nuclei discrimination in microscopy images (<a href=\"#bib45\">Huisman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lin et al., 2007</a>). On the other hand, BNCs are more recently developed classifiers which not only show good performance but also allow for probabilistic classification. In addition, BNCs reveal the hierarchy of parameters used for the classification (<a href=\"#bib31\">Friedman et al., 1997</a>), which may provide insights into underlying biological processes."

For the LDA, the parameters were ranked using Fisher score (<a href=\"#bib23\">Duda et al., 2001</a>), and the most relevant ones were selected based on the classification accuracy (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a> and \u2018Methods\u2019).

Both classifiers recognized hepatocytes with ~100% accuracy, thus further improving the previous performance (<a href=\"#bib71\">O'Gorman et al., 1985</a>). The overall cell-type classification yielded 95.4% and 92.6% accuracy for the LDA and BNC, respectively. Although discriminating non-parenchymal cells is difficult even for a person skilled in the art, our algorithms achieved accuracy higher than 90%. The predictive performance of the classifiers is shown in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>. As expected, the first largest population of cells corresponds to hepatocytes (44.6% \u00b1 2.7%, mean \u00b1 SEM) followed by sinusoidal endothelial cells (29.8% \u00b1 2.5%). Surprisingly, we found important quantitative differences for Kupffer and stellate cells. The percentage of Kupffer cells (8.7% \u00b1 0.7%) was lower than that of stellate cells (11.2% \u00b1 1.0%), against previous estimates on 2D images (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baratta et al., 2009</a>). The percentage of other cells was 5.7% \u00b1 0.8%.

The expansion was either limited to the cell cortex (i.e. the maximum density of actin) or to contacts with neighbouring cells or tubular structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The active mesh expansion was parameterized by inner pressure and mesh rigidity. However, this algorithm over-segmented bi-nucleated cells into two cells with a single nucleus. Therefore, we used phalloidin intensity and nucleus-to-nucleus distance to recognize over segmented multinuclear cells and merge them. A manual check of segmentation of 2559 cells revealed only ~2% error for hepatocyte segmentation that is a further improvement of the state-of-the-art achievements by voxel-based segmentation methods (<a href=\"#bib67\">Mosaliganti et al., 2012</a>).

Each synthetic image consisted of four channels for the main structures forming the tissue, that is, cell nuclei, cell borders, sinusoidal and BC\u00a0networks. We first generated 3D models of liver tissue based on experimental data (see \u2018Methods\u2019). The benchmark models had levels of complexity similar to that of the real tissue (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>,<a href=\"#fig3s6\">6</a>). Second, we imposed uneven staining to the models in order to resemble the experimental data. Third, the artificial microscopy images were simulated by convolving the models according to the 3D confocal microscope point spread function (PSF) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Nasse et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Nasse and Woehl, 2010</a>) and adding z-dependent Poisson noise. The resulting benchmark image statistics were similar to those from the images acquired in our experimental setup (see \u2018Methods\u2019) (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Given their general usefulness for testing image analysis software, the benchmark images and models are provided as supplementary material (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">Morales-Navarrete et al., 2016</a>). Finally, we applied our 3D tissue reconstruction pipeline to the benchmark images and quantified the accuracy of the reconstructed models\u00a0using the precision-sensitivity framework (<a href=\"#bib78\">Powers, 2011</a>). The overall quality was expressed as F-score,\u00a0the harmonic mean between precision and sensitivity. The benchmark tests were performed in three sets of images with different signal-to-noise ratio (10:1, 4:1, 2:1). For tubular structures, we achieved average (over the different noise level sets) F-scores of 0.90 \u00b1 0.04 and 0.73 \u00b1 0.06 for sinusoidal and BC networks, respectively. In the case of the nuclei and cell segmentation, we found average F-scores 0.91 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.92 \u00b1 0.03, respectively. The detailed quantifications are shown in <a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7A\u2013L</a>. Additionally, we measured morphometric parameters of the reconstructed structures such as the average radius of the tubular structures (BC and sinusoidal networks) and cell volumes.

Geometric features have important implications, for example, for the development of models of fluid exchange between blood and hepatocytes (<a href=\"#bib89\">Wisse et al., 1985</a>). A critical parameter for blood flux models is the radius of sinusoids. We measured a radius of 4.0 \u00b1 1.1\u00a0\u03bcm, a value close to quantifications by electron microscopy (EM) analysis (<a href=\"#bib89\">Wisse et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Oda et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">McCuskey, 2008</a>).

We could not only perform accurate measurements of hepatocytes volumes and poly-nucleation, but also correlate them with polyploidy and spatial localization within the tissue. Interestingly, we found a multi-modal distribution of hepatocyte volumes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) in line with measurements on isolated hepatocytes (<a href=\"#bib60\">Martin et al., 2002</a>). A trivial explanation is that it reflects the presence of mono- and bi-nucleated hepatocytes. However, we found that this was not the case. The distribution of volumes of both mono- and bi-nucleated hepatocytes can be independently described by a mixture of two populations with mean volumes 3126 \u00b1 1302\u00a0\u00b5m<sup>3</sup> (~14% of cells) and 5313 \u00b1 1175\u00a0\u00b5m<sup>3</sup> (~10% of cells), and 5678 \u00b1 1176\u00a0\u00b5m<sup>3</sup> (~45% of cells) and 10606 \u00b1 1532\u00a0\u00b5m<sup>3</sup> (~30% of cells), respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Hence, surprisingly, although the bi-nucleated hepatocytes are assumed to be larger than the mono-nucleated, we found that a population of mono-nucleated hepatocytes can have a volume that does not differ from that of bi-nucleated hepatocytes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>)."

Therefore, we classified hepatocytes with respect to number of nuclei, volume and DNA content using a hierarchical cluster algorithm. We identified seven populations, namely 2n, 4n, 8n, 16n for mono-nuclear and 2\u00d72n, 2\u00d74n, 2\u00d78n for bi-nuclear hepatocytes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E,F</a>).

These discrepancies prompted us to analyse the spatial distribution of mono- and bi-nucleated hepatocytes within the lobule. We particularly analysed the largest populations of hepatocytes, 2n, 4n, 2\u00d72n and 2\u00d74n. Strikingly, we found a pronounced zonation in their localization. Whereas the 2n mono-nucleated were enriched in the PC and PV regions, mono-nucleated 4n showed a homogeneous distribution between PV and PC regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The 2\u00d72n bi-nucleated hepatocytes have a similar pattern as the 2n mono-nucleated (highly enriched in the CV and PV regions), but the density of 2\u00d74n bi-nucleated was lower in those regions and increased in the middle region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). As far as we know, this is the first time that polyploidy and poly-nuclearity are found to be zonated and follow a specific pattern.

Our pipeline is implemented in a freely available platform designed to address unmet computational needs. Despite many efforts, the reconstruction of digital geometrical models of tissues suffers from critical bottlenecks such as lack of automation, limited accuracy and low throughput analysis (<a href=\"#bib77\">Peng et al., 2010</a>). The platform developed here overcomes such bottlenecks in that it (1) achieves high accuracy of geometric reconstruction, (2) can process large volumes of imaged tissue, for example, a full liver lobule, (3) increases the image analysis performance to such an extent that the model reconstruction time is shorter than the biological experimental time and compatible with middle-throughput (this is achieved by combining the computational efficiency of C++ with the CPU/GPU multi-threading capabilities), (4) can be run on a regular PC and (5) provides a flexible tool for constructing image processing pipelines that are tuneable for specific tissue and imaging conditions. For the automatic recognition of different cell types, we included morphological classifiers into the software. The user-friendly pipeline assembly mechanism allows adjusting the platform for specific tissue analysis demands. The newly developed algorithms both increase the quality of the results (e.g. 3D image de-noising, LME method, active mesh tuning, cell classification) and deal with problems for which there appears currently to be no real good solutions available (e.g. correction of tissue deformation and combination of individual sections in the case of partial tissue removal) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our platform is implemented as stand-alone free to download software (<a href=\"http://motiontracking.mpi-cbg.de\">http://motiontracking.mpi-cbg.de</a>). Furthermore, we created a benchmark of realistic images (with the underlying ground truth model) for the evaluation of 3D segmentation algorithms in biological images (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">Morales-Navarrete et al., 2016</a>)."

The resulting model was used to extract quantitative measurements of various features of liver tissue organization, such as radius, branching angles and cardinality of the sinusoidal and BC networks, and to recognize different cell types based on their morphological parameters. Our analysis revealed an unexpected zonation pattern of hepatocytes with different size, nuclei and DNA content within the liver lobule. Furthermore, we extended the analysis to two additional tissues, lung and kidney, demonstrating the general applicability and robustness of our platform."

The new algorithms allow correcting major defects originating from tissue sectioning, improve the segmentation of cellular, subcellular and tissue-level structures, and extract morphological features and distributions in space. A major limiting factor in the development of a comprehensive geometrical model is the trade-off between imaging large volumes of samples to gain a view of the overall tissue architecture and imaging at high-resolution to achieve an accurate description of the structures at the limit of resolution of the light microscope, for example, the apical surface of hepatocytes forming the BC\u00a0network. We solved this problem by imaging the tissue at low-resolution and registering within it the parts of tissue (the PV-PC area in the case of the liver lobule) imaged at high\u00a0resolution. In this way, the measured morphological features (e.g. BC) and parameters (e.g. cell size) are embedded in their proper context of tissue architecture. For example, the hepatocyte volume is a parameter that has little value as average without considering the distribution of parameter values in the lobule (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In general, the diversity of geometric features of the cells within the liver lobule could provide new insights into the regulation of metabolic zonation (see below)."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1K</a>, the major source of errors is over-segmented nuclei. Additional steps to improve nuclei reconstruction, such as the region-merging algorithm (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chittajallu et al., 2015</a>) to correct for over-segmentation, could reduce such errors. Even though our cell segmentation method proved able to identify and reconstruct cells with high accuracy, in a few cases (~2%), binuclear cells were mistaken for two separate cells due to weak staining of the cell cortex. Therefore, implementation of additional methods for enhancing the staining of the cell surface, such as the anisotropic plate diffusion filters (<a href=\"#bib66\">Mosaliganti et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">2012</a>), could help reduce further the over-segmentation of multi-nuclear cells."

This is important since the accuracy of a geometrical model is indispensable for the development of predictive models of tissue function. For example, a model of blood flow through the sinusoidal network and exchange with hepatocytes via the space of Disse (<a href=\"#bib73\">Ohtani and Ohtani, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Wisse et al., 1985</a>) critically depends on the estimation of the sinusoid diameter. An overestimation of the sinusoidal tube radius would have major consequences for the predictions of blood cells flow through the sinusoidal network. Our geometrical model yielded a diameter of the sinusoidal-walled tube equal to the typical size of erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Therefore, it supports the model of active exchange of blood serum and lymph in the space of Disse, whereby blood flux propels cells through the sinusoids causing waves of capillary walls deformation (<a href=\"#bib62\">McCuskey, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Wisse et al., 1985</a>). The active mesh tuning algorithm yielded a distribution of the radius of sinusoid capillaries with a mean value that was 20% lower (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) than previously estimated by similar approaches (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hammad et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Hoehme et al., 2010</a>), but in line with the values reported by EM (<a href=\"#bib89\">Wisse et al., 1985</a>). The reconstruction also revealed a large difference with the previously reported angles between two arms of branching sinusoids (112\u00b0 vs. 32\u00b0, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Moreover, the geometrical model provides correct values for other sinusoidal network parameters such as number of intersection nodes per mm<sup>3</sup> (8.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup> \u00b1 1.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>) and network length per mm<sup>3</sup> (3.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> \u00b1 0.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> \u00b5m), which appear to have been overestimated in a recent report (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hammad et al., 2014</a>) (see \u2018Methods\u2019). The discrepancy between our geometrical model and others (<a href=\"#bib44\">Hoehme et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hammad et al., 2014</a>) could be due to differences in image processing and/or experimental procedures (tissue fixation, image acquisition, etc.). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that our platform applies the active mesh approach to the segmentation of structures on different scales (from the apical surface of hepatocytes forming the BC to cells) and this may yield a more precise geometrical reconstruction in comparison with voxel-based methods (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

The accuracy of both approaches was comparable, reaching higher than 99% efficiency for hepatocyte recognition and about 92\u201395% for all cell types. The latter value is highly significant since the distinction between stellate and sinusoid endothelial cells in the absence of specific markers is challenging even for a skilled person. The analysis of parameters that were mostly informative for cell type discrimination yielded some unexpected results. Although nuclear size and roundness were traditionally considered a priori as the most relevant parameters to discriminate hepatocytes from non-parenchymal cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baratta et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">O'Gorman et al., 1985</a>), we found that they are less informative than the parameters related to nuclear texture (e.g. moments of lacunarity). The analysis of parameters relevant for cell classification can shed light on the differences in cell morphology that are difficult to grasp by the naked eye. The accurate active mesh-based cell shape estimation led to well-separated peaks of cell volume distribution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>), which failed to be discriminated by approximation through Voronoi tessellation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bock et al., 2010</a>) (data not shown)."

It is well established that hepatocytes are heterogeneous in size, number of nuclei (mono and bi-nucleated cells) and DNA content (polyploidy). However, we observed that these features are not randomly distributed but follow a specific zonation pattern within the liver lobule. Surprisingly, the mono-nucleated 2n and bi-nucleated 2\u00d72n hepatocytes were enriched in the CV and PV regions, whereas bi-nucleated 2\u00d74n were more frequent in the middle region. This particular distribution suggests that polyploidy is spatially regulated and follows a gradient between CV and PV. Zonation of metabolic activities in the liver is well known, but zonation of mono- and bi-nucleated cells and total DNA content (polyploidy) remains controversial. The spatial distribution of hepatocytes according to their ploidy in the CV-PV axes correlates with the metabolic zonation. This correlation suggests a possible role of polyploidy in regulating hepatocyte functions in the liver lobule. Interestingly, two unique populations of cells with stem cell-like properties and the capacity to repopulate the liver have been recently identified (<a href=\"#bib81\">Ray, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Font-Burgada et al., 2015</a>). One population located close to the CV, which has been implicated in homeostatic hepatocyte renewal (<a href=\"#bib88\">Wang et al., 2015</a>), coincides with the mono-nucleated 2n cells we identified. The other population of hepatocytes located near the PV, which was found to repopulate the liver after injury (<a href=\"#bib29\">Font-Burgada et al., 2015</a>), could correspond to the low ploidy cells (2n and 2\u00d72n) we observed. These results inspire future studies aimed at exploring the mechanisms underlying regulation of mono- versus bi-nuclearity and polyploidy in the context of liver tissue structure, function and regeneration (<a href=\"#bib92\">Zaret, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Ray, 2015</a>).

Therefore, they are based on local correlation of the images (<a href=\"#bib82\">Saalfeld et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Hayworth et al., 2015</a>). In the case of soft tissues, the removal of tissue upon cutting is much more significant, leading to a lack of texture correlations between two adjacent sections. The sample preparation process introduces several mechanical artefacts to the imaged sample, including uneven thickness of the section and tissue bending. When large vessels are aligned along the section surface, it becomes difficult to determine whether the empty space corresponds to the interior of the vessel or section damages or bending, which constitutes a major obstacle in their segmentation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). To address this issue, we propose a surface detection method, which uses prior distributions of expected section shape to find the border between the volume of the image of the sample (including blood vessels) and the out-of-field region."

First, mechanical distortions such as uneven cutting of the section or tissue bending during imaging are introduced in the imaged sample. Since large vessels are not stained, it is impossible to distinguish them from out-of-field region using only the voxels intensities. Second, image intensities vary spatially within the sample due to uneven staining. In consequence, a global threshold underestimates the size of vessels in the bright regions of the image and overestimates it in the dark ones. To address these problems,we introduced two pre-processing steps. At first, we used the detected surfaces of the section to discriminate the parts of the image belonging to the sample from the ones in the out-of-field region. Subsequently, the 3D images (excluding the out-of-field region) were split into regular grids of overlapping sub-regions and the maximum entropy threshold was calculated for each of them. After that, the threshold values were interpolated over the entire image using tri-linear interpolation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Finally, the vessels were segmented using the calculated threshold values (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

First, the relative shift between two images was found by the peak of their NCC, the images were shifted accordingly and its overlapping part was cropped. Second, the cropped images were transformed to polar coordinates (where a shift is equivalent to a rotation in the Cartesian coordinate system) and their NCC was calculated. The updated angle r was extracted from the peak of the cross-correlation of the transformed image. Note that the initial estimation of r (\u00b115\u00b0) found in the initial step is required for the convergence of the polar registration. The polar registration procedure was repeated subsequently using the images stored in the second and first level of scale pyramid, which results in the increase of the registration accuracy and computational time in each iteration of the algorithm. Also, 2\u20133 iterations were sufficient to achieve full convergence and register images with subcellular accuracy (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013F</a>)."

Panel (<b>A</b>) shows single 2D plane sections of a liver tissue image stained for sinusoids (magenta), whereas the segmentation generated by TiQuant (provided within the dataset) is shown as a partially transparent (green) image overlapping with the original one. Our reconstructions are shown as object contours (magenta lines). Panel (<b>B</b>) shows the radius distributions of the sinusoidal network extracted from reconstructions provided by TiQuant (red) and generated by the MT pipeline (blue). The estimated value of the radius is expressed in voxels since no information about the voxel size is provided. Each histogram was fit by a Gaussian distribution (with mean 14.08 and 11.00, for TiQuant and MT, respectively). The dots correspond to the extracted data and the solid lines to the corresponding fits. Our active mesh tuning approach yielded radius estimation for the sinusoidal network ~20% smaller than the voxel-based methods of TiQuant. These results are in line with the ones obtained from our experimental data."
