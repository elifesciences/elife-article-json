Although mouse models of Rett syndrome (RTT), a postnatal neurological disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in <i>MECP2,</i> display impaired excitatory neurotransmission, the RTT phenotype can be largely reproduced in mice simply by removing MeCP2 from inhibitory GABAergic neurons. To determine what role excitatory signaling impairment might play in RTT pathogenesis, we generated conditional mouse models with <i>Mecp2</i> either removed from or expressed solely in glutamatergic neurons. MeCP2 deficiency in glutamatergic neurons leads to early lethality, obesity, tremor, altered anxiety-like behaviors, and impaired acoustic startle response, which is distinct from the phenotype of mice lacking MeCP2 only in inhibitory neurons. These findings reveal a role for excitatory signaling impairment in specific neurobehavioral abnormalities shared by RTT and other postnatal neurological disorders."

Although mouse models of Rett syndrome (RTT), a postnatal neurological disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in <i>MECP2,</i> display impaired excitatory neurotransmission, the RTT phenotype can be largely reproduced in mice simply by removing MeCP2 from inhibitory GABAergic neurons. To determine what role excitatory signaling impairment might play in RTT pathogenesis, we generated conditional mouse models with <i>Mecp2</i> either removed from or expressed solely in glutamatergic neurons. MeCP2 deficiency in glutamatergic neurons leads to early lethality, obesity, tremor, altered anxiety-like behaviors, and impaired acoustic startle response, which is distinct from the phenotype of mice lacking MeCP2 only in inhibitory neurons. These findings reveal a role for excitatory signaling impairment in specific neurobehavioral abnormalities shared by RTT and other postnatal neurological disorders."

Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in a gene called <i>MECP2</i>, which is found on the X chromosome. Males with <i>MECP2</i> mutations are rare but have more severe symptoms and die young. Many researchers who study Rett syndrome use mice as a model of the disorder. In particular, male mice with the mouse equivalent of the human <i>MECP2</i> gene switched off in every cell in the body (also known as <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice) show many of the features of Rett syndrome and die at a young age."

The experiments showed that male mice without <i>Mecp2</i> in their excitatory neurons develop tremors, anxiety-like behaviors, abnormal seizure-like brain activity and severe obesity; these mice also die earlier than normal mice. Female mice lacking <i>Mecp2</i> in half of their excitatory neurons (because the gene is on the X chromosome) were less affected than the males, and had normal life spans. These symptoms are different from those seen in mice missing <i>Mecp2</i> only in inhibitory neurons."

In male mice (which show more severe symptoms), activating <i>Mecp2</i> in only the excitatory neurons reduced the anxiety and tremors. These findings suggest that impaired excitatory neurons may be responsible for specific symptoms such as anxiety and tremors amongst other Rett-syndrome-like features."

For example, mouse models of Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe postnatal onset neurological disorder, show diminished excitatory drive and overall reduced cortical microcircuit activity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wood et al., 2009</a>). Conversely, the <i>Met</i> conditional deletion mouse (a model of nonsyndromic, sporadic autism) shows increased excitatory synaptic connectivity from cortical layer 2/3 to layer 5B corticostriatal neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Qiu et al., 2011</a>). Certainly the prevalence of epilepsy as a comorbidity with ASDs and intellectual disability disorders would suggest a tendency toward hyperexcitation, but both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations are affected in these disorders. It is difficult to discern the contributions of different neuronal groups to pathogenesis, however, in part because genes driving disorders such as RTT, Fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis (<i>MECP2, FMRP</i>, <i>UBE3A</i>, and <i>TSC1</i> and <i>TSC2</i>, respectively) participate in fundamental cellular processes in multiple cell types (<a href=\"#bib9\">Crino, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Darnell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lyst and Bird, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mabb et al., 2011</a>), and in part because network alterations always induce compensatory changes in the circuit (<a href=\"#bib44\">Turrigiano, 2011</a>)."

This is the approach we and others have taken to understand the contribution of various neuronal types to the complex, wide-ranging phenotype of RTT, which is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ubiquitously expressed <i>MECP2</i> (methyl CpG-binding protein 2) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amir et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Trappe et al., 2001</a>). Removing <i>Mecp2</i> from SIM-1 expressing hypothalamic neurons, for example, results in hyperphagia, obesity and aggression (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fyffe et al., 2008</a>), whereas deficiency of MeCP2 in somatostatin-positive neurons causes seizures and stereotypies (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ito-Ishida et al., 2015</a>). The most surprising result, however, given early studies suggesting RTT involves impairment in excitatory signaling (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chao et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chapleau et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Marchetto et al., 2010</a>), came from conditional knockout of <i>Mecp2</i> in GABAergic neurons. These GABAergic conditional knockout mice reproduce most of the features observed in the <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice: premature lethality, stereotyped forepaw motions and other repetitive behaviors, abnormal social interaction, learning and memory deficits, hypoactivity, ataxia, and hindlimb clasping (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chao et al., 2010</a>). The only features of the <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice that did not develop in the GABAergic knockouts were tremor and anxiety-like behaviors. What role, then, do the excitatory signaling impairments observed in Rett patients and previous mouse models play in RTT pathogenesis?"

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from these neurons in 6- to 8-week old mice revealed reduced spontaneous action potential firing in CKO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) similar to that observed in the <i>Mecp2</i>-null mutants (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dani et al., 2005</a>). In the presence of synaptic transmission blockers, neurons in CKO mice showed similar firing rates in response to injected currents as WT neurons, indicating normal intrinsic excitabilities (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). To explore the cause of reduced spontaneous activity, we focused on the total excitatory and inhibitory drive onto layer V pyramidal neurons. In the presence of ongoing network activity within the slices, we recorded spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) by voltage-clamping the cell membrane at the measured chloride-reversal potential (WT: \u221270.8 \u00b1 0.4\u00a0mV; Cre: \u221269.1 \u00b1 0.3\u00a0mV; Flox: \u221270.7 \u00b1 0.5\u00a0mV; CKO: \u221269.9 \u00b1 0.6\u00a0mV), while spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were recorded by holding the cell at the measured cation-reversal potential (WT: 14.3 \u00b1 0.4\u00a0mV; Cre: 12.9 \u00b1 0.4\u00a0mV; Flox: 14.3 \u00b1 0.8\u00a0mV; CKO: 12.7 \u00b1 0.2\u00a0mV). Interestingly, both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic charges were reduced in CKO mouse neurons compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>), indicating that the observed reduction in cortical activity is most likely caused by reduced excitatory input to layer V neurons. To determine if the change in sEPSCs is caused by an alteration in quantal responses (miniature EPSCs, mEPSCs) or spike-driven EPSCs, we recorded \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-dependent mEPSCs. The frequency of mEPSCs recorded from CKO mice was significantly decreased when compared to WT mice and showed a trend of reduction although not significant when compared with Cre or Flox mice (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The amplitude of mEPSCs and both the amplitude and frequency of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) did not differ significantly across genotypes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). These data suggest that the weakened spike-driven excitatory input to layer V pyramidal neurons largely accounts for the reduced firing rate in CKO mice."

The stop-null mice also showed reduced mEPSC frequency (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>) as reported in <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chao et al., 2007</a>), while this defect was reversed in C-rescue mice.

The male C-rescue mice gained some weight with age, but less than littermates, and they remained underweight (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). To identify the cause of weight abnormalities in both CKO and C-rescue mice, we housed mice individually in calorimetry chambers for 6 days from P25-30 to simultaneously monitor food intake, activity, and components of energy balance. After a two-day acclimation period, we assessed average food intake per day over the subsequent 3 days, accounting for initial differences in individual weights. The CKO mice consumed about 25\u201340% more food than controls (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and this hyperphagia was associated with significantly greater weight and fat gain (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). Evaluation of total energy expenditure, resting metabolic rate, and total activity of the mice revealed no significant difference between CKO and controls (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>). The CKO mice had a higher respiratory exchange ratio (RER) when they had free access to food (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>), but normal RER during fasting (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>), suggesting greater lipogenesis but no impediment to fat utilization. In contrast, P25-30 male C-rescue mice consumed less food than stop-null and control mice (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), which correlated with less gain of fat and weight (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B and C</a>). They displayed no significant difference in total daily energy expenditure, resting metabolic rate, RER, or total activity compared with controls (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013H</a>). The obesity of CKO mice and the underweight phenotype of male C-rescue mice therefore appear to be caused by abnormal energy intake rather than altered energy expenditure."

We found focal seizure-like spike-and-wave discharges (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) in three out of eight 10-week-old CKO mice that underwent video-EEG recordings.

We did not find seizure-like discharges in control mice (9 Flox, 6 Cre, and 5 WT mice). Interestingly, we observed behavioral seizures on male C-rescue mice older than 25-week-old during routine husbandary. We then conducted EEG recording on four 25- to 30-week-old male C-rescue mice, as well as two WT and two Cre mice that were at similar age. One out of those four male C-rescue mice, but no WT or Cre mice, showed spike-and-wave discharges (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). They occurred at 3.3 episodes/hour and the average duration of episodes was 4.5 \u00b1 0.8\u2009s (<i>n</i> = 10). Thus, deleting MeCP2 only from glutamatergic neurons induced seizure-like abnormal EEGs, while restoring MeCP2 only in this group of neurons is not sufficient to rescue seizures."

At 5 weeks of age, CKO mice showed similar locomotor function as controls when they traveled in the open field (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). While, in the elevated plus maze test, they stayed longer in the open arms, which can indicate decreased anxiety (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>); on the other hand, they spent less time in the light chamber during the light/dark assay and made fewer transitions between the two chambers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), suggesting increased anxiety. These seemingly paradoxical results replicate the altered anxiety-like behaviors of <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heckman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pelka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Stearns et al., 2007</a>).

Interestingly, restoration of MeCP2 solely in glutamatergic neurons was able to fully normalize this behavior, as the male C-rescue mice performed similarly as WT and Cre mice in those assays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and D</a>). This reversal of altered anxiety in the male C-rescue mice was maintained to 20 weeks of age, when most stop-null mice were dead and could not be included in the experiment (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>)."

For instance, the 6-week-old CKO mice, C-rescue, and stop-null mice all exhibited ataxia, as indicated by a shorter latency to fall from the accelerating rotarod (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). It is understandable that glutamatergic neurons would be necessary but not sufficient to ensure motor coordination, given that multiple neural populations and glia cells are necessary to keep the circuit intact. Strikingly, restoration of MeCP2 only in glutamatergic neurons affected behaviors that did not appear as deficits in the CKO mice but did develop in the stop-null mice, such as social interaction and repetitive behaviors. The CKO mice showed normal interest in familiar and non-familiar partners in the partition test of social behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), based on the time they spent interacting with partners, and they displayed no repetitive behaviors on the hole-board assay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). The stop-null mice, however, showed increased interest in partners and repetitive behavior, both of which were normalized to WT level in the male C-rescue mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D and F</a>).

Given the entangled nature of excitatory and inhibitory signaling, it is surprising that deleting or restoring MeCP2 only in glutamatergic neurons leads to complementary phenotypes of tremor, anxiety, and acoustic startle response (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In the case of acoustic startle response, this is not entirely unexpected: the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC) is the major sensorimotor interface, and proper glutamatergic signaling is necessary for the transmission of auditory information onto PnC neurons through action on AMPAR (<a href=\"#bib25\">Koch and Schnitzler, 1997</a>). As for anxiety and tremor, our findings suggest that the circuits involved are more resistant to inhibitory but not excitatory disturbance, possibly due to their specific connectivity. Similarly, the cerebellar circuits may be more vulnerable to inhibitory alteration since inhibitory Purkinje cells are the sole output of the cerebellar cortex. It is therefore understandable that re-expression of MeCP2 in inhibitory neurons (see companion paper <a href=\"#bib45\">Ure et al., 2016</a>) but not excitatory neurons was sufficient to rescue motor coordination deficits. It is also not surprising that several other <i>Mecp2</i>-null features, including ataxia, premature lethality, and obesity, can be reproduced in both excitatory and inhibitory <i>Mecp2</i> CKO mice, since those circuits are disturbed with alteration in either excitation or inhibition. Thus, restoring MeCP2 in neither excitatory nor inhibitory neurons alone is sufficient to fully rescue premature lethality. Similarly, re-expressing MeCP2 in excitatory neurons failed to maintain body weight, as the C-rescue mice were underweight when compared with WT animals, indicating the necessity of MeCP2 in inhibitory neurons to balance the circuit."

This is reasonable considering that in addition to the MeCP2 expressed in glutamatergic neurons, female C-rescue mice also retain MeCP2 in over 50% of non-glutamatergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Young and Zoghbi, 2004</a>), none of which express MeCP2 at all in male C-rescue mice. In this regard, it is interesting to note that re-expressing MeCP2 only in GABAergic neurons is less effective in a heterozygous background than in the <i>Mecp2</i>-null background (see companion paper <a href=\"#bib45\">Ure et al., 2016</a>). The opposite outcomes of these rescue strategies suggest that various types of neurons may be differentially sensitive to MeCP2 dosage, and it seems easier for the brain to compensate for the loss of MeCP2 in 50% of inhibitory neurons (glutamatergic female C-rescue) than in 50% of excitatory neurons (inhibitory female C-rescue). The possible reasons for this difference might include the distinct roles that these two types of neurons play in the brain circuit and the differential changes in gene expression due to loss of MeCP2 in these two types of neurons (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kodama et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Telfeian et al., 2003</a>). Nevertheless, it strongly argues for the use of <i>Mecp2</i>-heterozygous mice as the primary RTT disease model when developing and testing therapeutic strategies."

Together with the complete rescue of this defect by restoring MeCP2 only in glutamatergic neurons, this indicates an essential role of MeCP2 in modulating the firing activity of excitatory neurons. The dramatically reduced sEPSC charge reflects weakened excitatory drive onto the layer V neurons of CKO mice. Given that neurons usually need to receive above-threshold excitation to generate action potential (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1990</a>), the layer V neurons of CKO mice thus fired less often than controls even though they also received less inhibition. It is worth noting that this reduced firing activity in CKO mice may be region specific, as we also observed seizure-like spike-and-wave discharges in the cortex of these mice. Behavioral or electrographic seizures have also been reported in <i>Mecp2</i> whole brain (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chao et al., 2010</a>) and forebrain (<a href=\"#bib16\">Goffin et al., 2014</a>) inhibitory CKO mice, as well as in somatostatin CKO mice (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ito-Ishida et al., 2015</a>), although one group reported absence seizure (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>) but another group found no behavioral or electrographic seizures at all (<a href=\"#bib16\">Goffin et al., 2014</a>) with the forebrain excitatory neuron KO mice. These data suggest that the seizures we observe in <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice are caused by multi-level disruption of circuits that can arise from dysfunction of several different neuronal cell types. This is further supported by the C-rescue mice, as restoring MeCP2 only in excitatory neurons is insufficient to prevent seizure."

Through comparing and contrasting the excitatory conditional deletion and conditional rescue models, we confirmed the importance of MeCP2 in glutamatergic neurons to prevent anxiety-like behaviors. Importantly, we also highlighted its contribution to the pathogenesis of tremor, which is a common and highly penetrant symptom in individuals with RTT (<a href=\"#bib24\">Klauck et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Roze et al., 2007</a>), and has not been reported in any other cell type-specific <i>Mecp2</i> conditional deletion mouse.

Our results precisely complement previous knowledge and work from Ure et al., which shows that deficiency of MeCP2 in GABAergic neurons leads to ataxia, increased social interaction, repetitive behaviors, premature lethality, and obesity, but is less involved in tremor, altered anxiety, and impaired acoustic startle response. This work also provides an example of how primary deficits in excitatory signaling lead to neurological deficits, which has ramifications for other postnatal neurological disorders, with disturbances in excitatory and inhibitory homeostasis, such as ASDs and intellectual disability."

This seems to be the case, as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> we showed that it did rescue the decreased firing rate in stop-null mice. To better analyze inhibitory events we measured GABA mini frequency and amplitude in layer V pyramidal neurons as the reviewers suggested (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In contrast to Zhang et al. we did not see any significant change across genotypes. This differing result from similar mouse models may be due to the expression of MeCP2 in glia, since the <i>Emx1</i>-Cre used by Zhang et al. drives Cre expression in both cortical excitatory neurons and glia, while the <i>Vglut2-</i>Cre we used in our study only targets glutamatergic neurons.

Within a network excitatory neurons drive inhibitory activity and in turn inhibitory neurons are the ones that regulate excitatory activity. It is rather surprising that the function of these two neuron populations can be disentangled with clear distinctions. Therefore, it is important for the authors to comment on the interplay and overlap between the two animal models in addition to their distinctions.</i>"
