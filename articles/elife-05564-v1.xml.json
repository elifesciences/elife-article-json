The effectiveness of screening depends on several factors, including pathogen natural history and epidemiology, human behavior, and characteristics of the source epidemic. We developed a mathematical model to understand how these factors combine to influence screening outcomes. We analyzed screening programs for six emerging pathogens in the early and late stages of an epidemic. We show that the effectiveness of different screening tools depends strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features, as well as human factors in implementation and compliance. For pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics. For pathogens with short incubation, fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage. However, even in the most optimistic scenario arrival screening will miss the majority of cases."

The effectiveness of screening depends on several factors, including pathogen natural history and epidemiology, human behavior, and characteristics of the source epidemic. We developed a mathematical model to understand how these factors combine to influence screening outcomes. We analyzed screening programs for six emerging pathogens in the early and late stages of an epidemic. We show that the effectiveness of different screening tools depends strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features, as well as human factors in implementation and compliance. For pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics. For pathogens with short incubation, fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage. However, even in the most optimistic scenario arrival screening will miss the majority of cases."

Traveller screening policies, including fever screening and/or questionnaires at point of departure and/or arrival, have been proposed to limit the geographic spread of infection (<a href=\"#bib34\">Malone et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">World Health Organization, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cowling et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Khan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bogoch et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014a</a>).

Although fever is the symptom most commonly measured during screening, it might not be detected in all infected individuals for several reasons. First, those with recent exposure may not yet have progressed to a symptomatic stage (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pitman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mabey et al., 2014</a>). Second, travellers might be symptomatic but not febrile; the probability a symptomatic patient will have a fever varies by pathogen (<a href=\"#bib23\">Donnelly et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Louie et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Assiri et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Cowling et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gong et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014</a>).

Fourth, passengers may conceal fever and other symptoms during screening using antipyretic drugs (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nishiura and Kamiya, 2011</a>). At the same time, fever is notoriously non-specific as a symptom, leading to high opportunity costs from detaining travellers with non-target illnesses (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gunaratnam et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mabey et al., 2014</a>)."

Because information about risk factors does not depend on the presence of detectable symptoms at the time of screening, there is potential to identify a broader set of exposed travellers. However, epidemiological knowledge on factors linked to risk of infection is limited for some pathogens\u2014particularly for novel emerging pathogens that are often the focus of screening programs. Even for pathogens with well-characterized routes of transmission, not all cases will necessarily have a known source of exposure (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lau et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tuite et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Cowling et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gong et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014</a>).

To understand how departure and arrival screening combine with pathogen natural history, epidemiological knowledge, efficacy of screening methodology, and human behavioral factors to determine overall screening outcomes, we developed a general modelling framework (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) for the screening process. We used this framework to assess outcomes for six pathogens of current or recent concern: influenza A/H7N9, influenza A/H1N1p, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola virus, and Marburg virus. By separating the contribution of different factors to the probability of detecting infectious travellers, we evaluated pathogen-specific strengths and weaknesses of different screening strategies. We considered scenarios in which the source epidemic is growing or stable, as epidemic phase influences the distribution of times since exposure in potential travellers. We also identified factors that could improve the effectiveness of screening programs for future emerging pathogens."

There was considerable variability in incubation period among different pathogens (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Influenza A/H7N9 and A/H1N1p have the shortest incubation periods, while Ebola virus and Marburg virus have the longest. For some pathogens, the estimated variance in incubation period could increase with the addition of more data, which would improve characterization of the tails of the distribution. For instance, the incubation period distribution for Marburg virus was estimated from just five cases with a single exposure opportunity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Martini, 1973</a>); observing more cases might give rise to a right-skewed distribution as seen for Ebola virus. Similarly, the incubation period distribution for MERS-CoV is determined using data from only 23 confirmed cases, and its variance might also expand with the addition of more data. The possibility of a lengthy incubation period presents challenges for symptom screening."

Individuals with more recent exposure were less likely to display symptoms at the time of screening, and hence less likely to be identified by fever screening at departure. For pathogens with long incubation periods, the marginal value of fever screening at arrival was also lower.

Regardless of epidemic phase, the full screening program fails to detect at least 25% of infected travellers, despite our optimistic assumptions. Focusing on the contribution made by screening at point of arrival, our projections suggest that arrival screening will still miss half to three-quarters of infected travellers that manage to complete their flights (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D</a>). For pathogens with short incubation periods (i.e., influenza virus) fever detection was responsible for the majority of case identification in all epidemic phases.

We found that natural history, epidemiological knowledge and epidemic phase combined to determine overall screening outcomes, as well as the relative contribution of each screening method to case detection. Exposure risk screening made a greater contribution to case detection during growing epidemics and for pathogens with longer incubation periods, and when exposure risk factors were well-characterized epidemiologically."

For influenza viruses, which have the shortest incubation periods, our findings suggest that fever screening would be responsible for the majority of case detection in any epidemic context. The picture is more subtle for filoviruses, which have longer incubation periods and distinctive symptoms. When the source epidemic is still growing and many travellers are recently exposed, our model suggests half or more of case detection for filoviruses will be driven by exposure risk screening; when the epidemic has stabilized, the shift in the age structure of infections means fever is likely to become the dominant mechanism of case detection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

First, the variance of incubation period distributions can strongly modulate screening outcomes: the median incubation period for SARS-CoV is similar to influenza viruses, but because its distribution has a long right tail, the expected incubation time is longer. Thus, despite a short, influenza-like median incubation time, screening outcomes for SARS-CoV are filovirus-like and less favorable. Second, epidemiological knowledge is required to implement risk factor screening. Our results show that for pathogens with long incubation periods, early characterization of exposure risk factors is a powerful screening tool at the beginning of an outbreak; for these pathogens, robust characterization of and screening for specific exposure risk factors can contribute more to case detection than rapid implementation of fever screening (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3\u20134</a>). However, risk factor screening cannot improve screening effectiveness if factors that increase risk of exposure are not well characterized. For MERS-CoV, recent findings have strengthened the evidence that dromedary camels play a role in primary exposure of some cases, but it remains unclear whether the majority of transmission is driven by contact with infected humans or repeated zoonotic spillovers (<a href=\"#bib5\">Azhar et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cauchemez et al., 2014</a>)."

As well as enhancing potential case detection using risk factor screening, such knowledge could have the additional benefit of promoting general awareness of exposure risk factors, and hence contribute to reductions in risky behavior in affected regions. Further, when risk factors are known there is potential to conduct extended follow-up with travellers who have exposure risks, but no symptoms at the time of flight. For example, patients with known risks for Ebola exposure should be monitored by local health authorities near their travel destination until the maximum plausible incubation period has elapsed (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brown et al., 2014</a>)."

However, because influenza A/H7N9 infection has a short incubation period and a high probability of generating febrile symptoms, fever screening becomes a potent tool within just a few days of exposure and eclipses the potential contribution of risk factor-driven detection. Thus, even during a growing epidemic, where the proportion of asymptomatic travellers is highest, fever detection is likely to remain the dominant mechanism of detection for pathogens with short incubation periods, such as the influenza viruses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

This efficacy in turn depends on a combination of instrument and human factors. We assumed that fever and risk factor screening are implemented with 70% and 25% efficacy, respectively, which we consider upper bounds (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Although our results are qualitatively insensitive to these assumptions (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133</a>), the quantitative results of our main analysis likely represent best-case scenarios. The estimated efficacy of fever screening reflects the sensitivity of non-contact infrared thermal scanner equipment, but human factors may further reduce the efficacy of screening techniques. For example, data from influenza A/H1N1p screening in Tokyo in 2009 suggested antipyretic drug use could have been widespread among febrile travellers (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nishiura and Kamiya, 2011</a>). Additionally, outbreak-affected countries with heavily burdened public health systems may have limited resources to invest in departure screening, while limited preparation, awareness or focus may lower efficacy during arrival screening in countries outside the epidemic region."

For questionnaire-based screening, an essential unknown is the probability that travellers will divulge their exposure history if it puts them at risk of detainment or delay. We arrived at a rough, upper-bound estimate of 25% probability of honest reporting for the 2009 influenza A/H1N1p pandemic (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), but we emphasize that this is a topic in need of further study. Even more valuable would be effective ways to motivate travellers to honestly report their risky exposures. Increasing honest exposure reporting not only has the potential to enhance detection of infected travellers, but is essential for implementation of follow-up monitoring of travellers who may have been exposed but have not yet developed symptoms."

Because our model is structured so that fever screening precedes exposure risk screening, case detection through fever screening increasingly overlaps with potential detection through questionnaires as time since exposure increases. The model results appear to show that the effectiveness of exposure risk screening decreases with time since exposure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), but in fact this shows that risk factor screening becomes increasingly redundant when passengers are subject to fever screening first. We have treated fever screening as the primary means of detection, as it is much easier to conclusively diagnose infection when symptoms are present (<a href=\"#bib46\">Towner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014b</a>). The overall effectiveness of traveller screening, and the total proportion of cases detected before and after a flight, are independent of screening order. We did not consider the potential for case detection using symptoms other than fever. While other symptoms may aid in case detection, many (coughing, sneezing, etc) are also non-specific and more easily concealed than fever in the early stages of infection (<a href=\"#bib23\">Donnelly et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Louie et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Assiri et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gong et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014</a>).

This is another respect in which our results should be considered a best-case scenario projection of detection outcomes, assuming that the financial and opportunity costs of imposing additional clinical assessment on a large number of uninfected individuals can be neglected. Past screening programs have been implemented at large financial cost and have delayed large numbers of travellers, while detecting only a few cases (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), reflecting the fact that fever and many risk factors (e.g., contact with live poultry) have low positive predictive value for infection with rare pathogens. Though the high cost and low effectiveness of screening have been noted (<a href=\"#bib43\">St John et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">World Health Organization, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cowling et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gunaratnam et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mabey et al., 2014</a>), to the best of our knowledge no formal cost analysis of traveller screening policies has ever been conducted.

Our analysis suggests that arrival screening has the potential to make a non-negligible contribution to overall case detection, not only by detecting travellers who develop symptoms in flight, but also by detecting travellers who were missed by imperfect screening at departure. Hence, the additional benefit of arrival screening is greatest when efficacy of departure screening is relatively low, for example if potentially infected travellers primarily depart regions with limited public health re-sources and arrive in regions where public health resources are more abundant. Yet even costly policies that combine exit and arrival screening lack the potential to prevent all case importations. Our analysis suggests that in any context screening would miss a substantial proportion of infected travellers; this result is consistent with other analyses that highlight the limited effectiveness of screening (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pitman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bitar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mabey et al., 2014</a>) and with previous or ongoing screening outcomes (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

Thus there is a need to characterize the potential contributions of screening programs when implemented at different times, in different combinations, and for different pathogens; ultimately a quantitative understanding will be needed, to factor into cost-benefit calculations. In this study we begin to address these issues by demonstrating that screening outcomes depend strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features, as well as human factors in implementation and compliance. Our results emphasize the need to characterize basic properties of emerging pathogens, as this knowledge can enhance disease control measures."

To estimate the proportion of individuals with known source of exposure for a particular pathogen, we identified the fraction of confirmed cases in descriptive epidemiological studies who reported contact with a known source of infection (e.g., poultry for influenza A/H7N9; close contact with an infected human for SARS-CoV, influenza A/H1N1p, Marburg and Ebola). As we could not find published estimates for the proportion of MERS-CoV cases with known source of exposure outside a hospital setting (<a href=\"#bib4\">Assiri et al., 2013</a>), we assumed that exposure risk would not typically be known for MERS-CoV cases; this is consistent with recent publications highlighting the crucial knowledge gap in risk factors for MERS-CoV infection (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zumla et al., 2014</a>)."

As summarized in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, one study from the early phase of the pandemic in China showed that 29% (95% binomial CI: 25\u201333%) of cases were aware of their exposure to earlier cases (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cao et al., 2009</a>). Studies of influenza A/H1N1p screening in New Zealand (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hale et al., 2012</a>) and Australia (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gunaratnam et al., 2014</a>) estimated that self-reported exposure screening identified 3/45 and 4/69 infected passengers respectively. Assuming the lower limit of the CI, that is, 25% of the infected passengers knew about their exposure history, the New Zealand and Australia studies suggest that a proportion 3/(0.25 \u00d7 45) = 0.27 and 4/(0.25 \u00d7 69) = 0.23 of infected travellers who knew their exposure history reported so on the questionnaire. Based on this, in our main analysis we assumed a 25% probability of honest self-reporting of exposure risk in each questionnaire. The assumption of independent decisions on each questionnaire is optimistic: it allows travellers who did not report honestly at departure to report honestly at arrival. The estimated probability is also optimistic, since we used a low-end estimate of the fraction of travellers who knew their exposure history: if more travellers were aware of their exposure, our estimate for the proportion who reported correctly would have been lower."

First, we consider a stable scenario, when the epidemic in the source population is neither growing nor shrinking. We assume that individuals are equally likely to depart at any point during the time period between exposure and hospitalization (when they would likely be too ill to fly) or death. Thus the infection age distribution of travellers will mirror that of the non-hospitalized case population. To model time to hospitalization we assume a simple case, in which all individuals progress to hospitalization after a fixed period of time; the probability density function for exposure-to-hospitalization is therefore represented by a delta function centered at the average time from exposure to hospitalization in days derived from empirical studies, denoted D.

As noted in the main text, during past screening initiatives the absolute number of infected travellers was very low: for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 only 45 and 69 cases were imported in to Sydney and Auckland, respectively (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hale et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gunaratnam et al., 2014</a>). Between August and November 2014, only two Ebola importations occurred, both in the United States (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brown et al., 2014</a>). Therefore we chose to simulate detection for a population of 50 infected individuals, and recorded the number of individuals identified by screening.

The authors report the usage of 50 infected travelers for each scenario, for each disease, and they do not mention whether this process is repeated a certain number of times or not. The authors mention the use of bootstrapping to estimate the confidence intervals, but never mention the number of simulations used. One might argue that for some of the diseases studied the expected number of infected international passengers is small, thus justifying the relatively small number of infected travelers used in those particular cases. Nonetheless, in each scenario and for each disease, the process should be repeated a large number of times and have the results drawn from the statistics thereof, especially since the article goal is to provide a general picture of screening efficacy in future events. The authors should rerun their simulations taking that into account or explicitly mention the number of trials and number of infected passengers used. Hopefully it won't affect the general picture provided, but it should be done for consistency."

We repeated these simulations with appropriate modifications. This modification has led to slightly larger confidence intervals for some screening scenarios, but our overall conclusions remain unchanged. Additionally, reviewer 1 suggested several points for addition to the Discussion. We agreed that each of these would enhance our analysis and have made appropriate changes to the text.

On the other hand, our analysis suggests that arrival screening has the potential to make a non-negligible contribution to overall case detection, potentially detecting an additional 20% of infected travellers. Notably, arrival screening can contribute not only by detecting travellers who develop symptoms in flight, but also by detecting travellers who were missed by imperfect screening at departure. Hence, the additional benefit of arrival screening is greatest when efficacy of departure screening is relatively low, for example if potentially infected travellers primarily depart regions with limited public health resources and arrive in regions where public health resources are more abundant. Yet even costly policies that combine exit and arrival screening will not prevent all case importations. Our analysis suggests that even under optimistic assumptions screening at both departure and arrival would miss a quarter or more of infected travellers: this result is consistent with other analyses that highlight the limited effectiveness of screening (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pitman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bitar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mabey et al., 2014</a>) and with outcomes of past or ongoing screening programs (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Because the marginal cost of additional case detection with arrival screening is likely to be high, policy makers should carefully consider whether resources are better spent on arrival screening, which will reduce but not eliminate the importation of cases, or instead on tracing and containing cases that inevitably do arrive.\u201d"

One might argue that for some of the diseases studied the expected number of infected international passengers is small, thus justifying the relatively small number of infected travelers used in those particular cases. Nonetheless, in each scenario and for each disease, the process should be repeated a large number of times and have the results drawn from the statistics thereof, especially since the article goal is to provide a general picture of screening efficacy in future events.

During ongoing Ebola screening initiatives in the United States and the United Kingdom, only three infected travellers have passed through arrival screening. It is possible that the number of Ebola cases detained by departure screening in affected West African countries is higher, though currently available data does not suggest that large numbers of infected travellers have been detained. According to the most recent statistics we were able to find, as of October 8, 2014 no travellers with confirmed Ebola infection had been detained by exit screening in affected West African countries (CDC, 2014). The release of more current data would aid assessments of screening effectiveness at arrival or departure."
