Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are once differentiated cells that have been re-programmed to an embryonic stem cell-like state, providing a powerful platform for biology and medicine. However, they have been limited to a few mammalian species. Here we found that a set of four mammalian transcription factor genes used to generate iPSCs in mouse and humans can induce a partially reprogrammed pluripotent stem cell (PRPSCs) state in vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms, in mammals, birds, fish, and fly, which span 550 million years from a common ancestor. These findings are one of the first to show cross-lineage stem cell-like induction, and to generate pluripotent-like cells for several of these species with in vivo chimeras. We suggest that the stem-cell state may be highly conserved across a wide phylogenetic range."

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are once differentiated cells that have been re-programmed to an embryonic stem cell-like state, providing a powerful platform for biology and medicine. However, they have been limited to a few mammalian species. Here we found that a set of four mammalian transcription factor genes used to generate iPSCs in mouse and humans can induce a partially reprogrammed pluripotent stem cell (PRPSCs) state in vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms, in mammals, birds, fish, and fly, which span 550 million years from a common ancestor. These findings are one of the first to show cross-lineage stem cell-like induction, and to generate pluripotent-like cells for several of these species with in vivo chimeras. We suggest that the stem-cell state may be highly conserved across a wide phylogenetic range."

Accordingly, stem cells provide a powerful platform to study development (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arendt, 2008</a>), tissue regeneration (<a href=\"#bib36\">Langer and Vacanti, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Rossell\u00f3 et al., 2009</a>), disease mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib15\">Colman and Dreesen, 2009</a>), and gene therapeutic approaches to the brain and other organs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hwang et al., 2011</a>). Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the potential to be differentiated to most if not all cell types (pluripotent), whereas more differentiated stem cells, such as those in the skin, have a more restricted differentiation potential (multipotent or unipotent) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Collas et al., 2007</a>). Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are once mature cells that have been de-differentiated to become like the embryonic state (<a href=\"#bib77\">Thomson et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Takahashi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Yu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Maherali and Hochedlinger, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Stadtfeld et al., 2008</a>). One major advantage of iPSCs is that they can be made from differentiated cells, such as skin or fibroblasts, of an individual and do not require isolating cells from 2\u20136 day old embryos, which is controversial for human studies (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lo and Parham, 2009</a>). The finding that simple over-expression of four genes (<i>Oct4</i>, <i>Sox2</i>, <i>Klf4</i> and <i>c-myc</i>) was sufficient to generate iPSCs from adult cells of mice (<a href=\"#bib75\">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</a>) and humans (<a href=\"#bib74\">Takahashi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Yu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sommer et al., 2009</a>) made the process of generating and studying stem cells much more tractable in certain other mammalian species, where it was once difficult to generate stem cells, such as in rats (<a href=\"#bib40\">Li and Ding, 2010</a>) and pigs (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wu et al., 2009</a>)."

Some of these animals have traits similar to humans that are not found in closely related non-human primates or commonly used laboratory animals. These include vocal learning in parrots and songbirds (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jarvis, 2004</a>), widespread adult neurogenesis in non-mammalian vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nottebohm, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kaslin et al., 2008</a>), and vascularization and organ regeneration in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib60\">Poss et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Stoletov and Klemke, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Yaqoob and Schwerte, 2010</a>). Another important reason is that some traits are more easily studied in simpler organisms before they are applied to humans. The arthropod <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is an attractive genetic model due to the short life span, large number of offspring, and applicability of many genetic techniques (<a href=\"#bib80\">van Ham et al., 2009</a>). <i>Drosophila</i> have been used to model Parkinson\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s, and Prion disease. Unfortunately, production of non-mammalian stem cells has been limited, due to problematic or unknown isolation procedures, and insufficient maintenance methods (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lavial and Pain, 2010</a>). For these reasons, there has been a desire to generate stem cells for these species, allowing disease and mechanistic models to be explored, and possibly transgenic animals to be generated. Induced stem cells could provide such a model."

We found that the four transcription factor genes used to induce mammalian stem cells can produce a partial iPSC state that varies with degree of relationship to mammals. Moreover, the mammalian (mouse) homolog of these genes induced this partial iPSC reprogrammed state in the non-mammalian cells of all species tested, including inducing the ability of the vertebrate cells to incorporate into embryonic chimeras. We use the term partial iPSC or iPSC-like cells to denote cells that are transformed and show some iPSC characteristics.

We decided to transduce embryonic fibroblast cells of zebra finch and galliforms (quail and chicken) with a lentivirus retroviral vector (called STEMCCA [<a href=\"#bib68\">Sommer et al., 2009</a>]) containing the four genes from the mouse driven by the human EF1\u03b1 promoter (Map in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We surmised that the mouse genes might work in birds despite the separation of \u223c300 million years ago (MYA) from a common ancestor with mammals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), because although there were stretches of low homology and divergent sequences in three of the four genes (<i>Oct4</i>, <i>Klf4</i>, and c-<i>myc</i>), the overall conservation between birds and mammals was good (80\u201398% overall amino acid identity; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, all four genes had highly conserved DNA binding domains (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; red boxes). For an iPSC positive control, we isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts and transfected them with the same lentiviral cassette (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). For non-iPSC positive controls, we used established ESC lines of mouse (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nagy et al., 1993</a>) and chicken (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pain et al., 1996</a>). For two negative controls, we transduced fibroblasts of each species with the same lentivirus vector, but containing GFP in place of the four mouse transcription factors, and grew the cells either in our stem cell media or complete media (see media composition in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). For a third negative control, we cultured non-transfected fibroblasts in stem cell media for each species to make sure media alone could not induce the cells (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A, B</a>). The two negative control groups grown in stem cell media exhibited similar qualitative and quantitative characteristics, and therefore, to diminish redundancy, the data shown is from the GFP-transduced fibroblasts. We repeated our experiments at least seven independent times, with 12\u201318 wells per species in 48 well plates (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019), and used established guidelines to evaluate iPSCs (<a href=\"#bib45\">Maherali and Hochedlinger, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kim and Daley, 2009</a>)."

This included, within 5 days, transformation from fibroblast morphology (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) to colonies with characteristic clustered stem cell-like morphology (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These colonies had strong alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), a characteristic of early and mature stem and tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib55\">O\u2019Connor et al., 2008</a>), whereas the starting fibroblasts did not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). They expressed Stem Cell Specific Antigen-1 (SSEA-1; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), while none was detected in control fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). An average of 20% of the wells had iPSC-like cells, as measured by colony morphology and ALP activity (measured from seven independent experiments for each avian species). Later iterations with different media conditions produced transformed cells in up to 90% of the wells (Dai et al., unpublished date). The higher the viral titer used, the more colonies were produced (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); the highest titer, 10<sup>9</sup> U/ml, was used in the above experiments. We noticed some differences between the mouse and avian colonies, in that the mouse colonies as well as the individual cells within the colonies appeared on average slightly larger, while avian cells appeared more clustered. Similar differences have been observed when comparing human and mouse colonies (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nichols and Smith, 2009</a>). The mouse and avian iPSC-like colonies were similar to those in established lines of mouse and chicken ESCs that we treated under the same growth conditions, including differences between the species (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013H</a>). These features were absent from our control mouse and avian fibroblasts treated under the same conditions with and without the lentiviral GFP-vector lacking the four transcription factors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C,E</a>; and not shown)."

After the first and second passages (3\u20134 weeks), three of the endogenous avian homologs (Oct4, Sox2, c-myc) were significantly upregulated 10\u2013100-fold in the presence of their mammalian counterparts (except c-myc in quail; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>; green).

Thus the differences between experiments had more to do with other conditions than cell type differences between BG2 and S2 cells. However, there were differences between the two cell types (S2 and BG2) in the expression of induced genes. Like the S2 transformed cells, the BG2 transformed cells showed overexpression of SoxN, Escargot, Snail and Vasa. Unlike the S2 cells, the BG2 cells did not show significant overexpression of Diachaete, asense and VVL (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

We are currently passaging these chicken iPSC-like cells 1\u20132 times per week at a 1:4 dilution, and are above passage 20; we could be further along in passages, but froze the cells at various times over one year to postpone growth in order to conduct other experiments.

No EB formation occurred with the control cells of any of the species (fibroblast or S2), indicating that EB formation was specific to the iPSC-like cells and established ESCs.

To assess pluripotency in vivo, we employed two strategies: generation of (1) teratomas and (2) chimeric embryos with the iPSC-like cells (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We did not attempt to do so with the <i>Drosophila</i> cells, as the early embryo is nearly one large cytoplasm partially divided up by membranes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mavrakis et al., 2009</a>). Teratomas were attempted for avian species by injecting the iPSC-like cells into the testes of SCID nu/nu mice in 18 animals for each avian species (nine with control fibroblasts and 9 with iPSC-like cells). After 35 days, two (out of nine) of the chicken iPSC-like and three (out of nine) quail iPSC-like cells injected mice developed teratomas. These teratomas exhibited organized formation of endoderm (such as neuronal rossetts, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D</a>), mesoderm (such as bone, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,E</a>), and ectoderm (such as G.I Tract, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,F</a>), demonstrating pluripotency in vivo. None of the controls generated teratomas (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>). So far, none of the zebra finch iPSC-like cells formed teratomas, suggestive of possible species differences for in vivo pluripotency."

This required about 5000 cells for chicken and 100\u2013200 for fish. The rate of chimera formation was about 16% for the chicken (four out of 25 attempts) and 10% for fish embryos (10 out of 103 attempts). Embryos injected with iPSC-like cells were subject to higher mortality than those injected with control fibroblasts. In chicken, about 50% of the embryos did not reach the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of incubation, compared to only 20% for control cells. Similarly with zebrafish, about 60% of embryos injected with the iPSC-like cells did not survive, while the rate was negligible in control fibroblast injected embryos. These results are consistent with lower survival rates observed in iPSC-injected mice (<a href=\"#bib45\">Maherali and Hochedlinger, 2008</a>), and could be due to multiple factors, such as the iPSC causing tumors and some other type of aberrant growth. Interestingly, after 1 day, some of the iPSC-like-GFP injected fish embryos produced a secondary axis (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), suggesting a disruption in the developmental program. There were some zebrafish embryos, which, after 1 day of incorporation, exhibited a cluster of GFP labeled fibroblast derived cells (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), although to a lower intensity than the iPSC GFP homologs (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C</a>).

In some animals (both chicken and fish), the cells incorporated in nearly all organs of the body (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,G</a>), but for the most part they incorporated sporadically (chicken iPSC-like cells incorporation, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In the chicken, the iPSC-like cells differentiated into many cell types, including into muscle, intestines, skin, and brain, while in the fish, most of the incorporation was observed in the stomach and the head (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). A separate study will be conducted to see how long the embryos can live with the injected cells and whether they incorporated into mature gonads for germline transmission. No GFP immunolabel was detected in the 72hpf zebrafish or ED4 chicken controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,F</a>). These features are similar to those seen in the early mouse chimeras created with mouse iPSC cells (<a href=\"#bib75\">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</a>) and chicken chimeras created with chicken ESC cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lavial et al., 2007</a>). Like those studies, most of our surviving embryos looked normal with no overt differences from animals treated under the same conditions without injected cells or injected with non-transduced fibroblast cells. These findings demonstrate that the non-mammalian vertebrate cells we generated with mammalian genes are pluripotent for at least non-germline cells in a developing animal in vivo, and functionally behave like mouse and chicken ESC and iPSC in vivo up until the ages analyzed."

While our study was under review, others (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lu et al., 2012</a>) have recently shown that for one bird species, the quail, some of these properties can be induced using the human genes. We also had tested the four human transcription factors in all aves (chicken, quail, zebra finch) and zebrafish cells and found results similar to the ones obtained with the mouse factors (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and data not shown). We cautiously call these cells partial iPSC or iPSC-like compared to authentic iPSCs, which refer to cells capable of giving rise to not only most cell types of an adult animal, but also to functional gametes for non-human species. Characteristics which the non-mammalian iPSC-like cells we generated have in common with mouse iPSCs and ESCs are colony morphology, marker expression of induced genes, reactivation of some endogenous pluripotency genes, transgene-independent self-renewal, embryoid body formation, teratoma generation (for chicken and quail), and the ability to contribute to different cell lineages in chimeric embryos (for chicken and zebrafish; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

For example, in the quail and zebra finch iPSC-like cells Oct4 is 20\u201380-fold higher than in control fibroblasts, but lower than the 100\u2013400-fold increase seen in the chicken and mouse cells and yet not the 100\u20131000-fold increase typically seen in mouse cells (<a href=\"#bib67\">Soldner et al., 2009</a>). We further note that our fibroblast controls were from early embryos, which already had some Oct4 and Nanog expression (detected in PCR reactions by the 28<sup>th</sup> cycle). Thus, we believe that not only protocol differences exist between studies that affect expression levels, but we clearly find species differences in induction levels for all four genes. Importantly, despite these species differences, the lower levels of one or more of these genes was still sufficient to generate pluripotent cells. Thus, we conclude that is it is not necessary for these genes to be induced 500\u20131000-fold in order for the cells to show some level of pluripotency in vitro or in vivo across species."

All species we studied showed induced <i>SSEA-1</i>, but this gene is not induced in human iPSCs or ESCs (<a href=\"#bib74\">Takahashi et al., 2007</a>), indicating that human cells might be different from other vertebrates or at a different stem cell state. Nanog was induced in all species except zebrafish. Nanog is the third master transcription factor in the stem cell regulatory system (<a href=\"#bib52\">Nichols et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Silva et al., 2009</a>) that promotes self renewal in the absence of LIF (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chambers and Tomlinson, 2009</a>). However, recent studies suggest that Nanog may not be integrated in a pluripotency regulatory circuit in fish (<a href=\"#bib9\">Camp et al., 2009</a>). We note, though, that the so-called fish Nanog homolog (NCBI Accession # NP_001091862) of these and many other studies show low sequence identity across much of the protein coding sequence with birds (32%) and mammals (31%). In this regard, it is possible that the fish Nanog homolog has not been really identified or is not present in the zebrafish genome. The absence or very low induction of endogenous <i>Klf4</i> in all of the non-mammalian species may either be due to an inability of the mammalian genes to re-program this gene, redundancy of the Klf family (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jiang et al., 2008</a>), or a lineage specific difference of mammals. The later hypothesis is supported by the low expression of <i>Klf4</i> in chicken ESCs relative to control fibroblasts<i>.</i> Induction of endogenous <i>Klf4</i> has so far been found in several mammalian species, such as pig, mouse, and rats (<a href=\"#bib62\">Roberts et al., 2009</a>). It has been shown that Klf4 preferentially regulates genes involved in cell adhesion, either activating or inhibiting adhesion, and that cell adhesion can inhibit proliferation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Swamynathan et al., 2008</a>). This function is consistent with our findings that relative to mice, the non-mammalian iPSC-like cells are more adhesive to each other, which is known to slow proliferation even in mouse iPSCs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2011</a>). Future investigation could test these hypotheses by over-expressing mouse or species-specific Klf4 without silencing, and assessing long-term proliferation."

Oct-4 and Sox-2, along with Nanog, are known as master transcription factors for the pluripotent stem cell state in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chan et al., 2011</a>). Oct4 and Sox2 can dimerize and when bound to DNA motifs of their target genes, they activate gene regulatory networks involved in both self-renewal and pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib61\">Remenyi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Shi and Jin, 2010</a>). Sox2 alone has been shown to play various roles in different tissue types or cell states (<a href=\"#bib78\">Tomioka et al., 2002</a>). Oct-4 has been deemed the most important of these master factors in the mammalian stem cell regulatory system (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sterneckert et al., 2011</a>). Although not a master factor, c-myc is known to induce proliferation, by repressing growth arresting genes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gartel and Shchors, 2003</a>). This makes it a key contributor in inducing the self-renewal state of the cell. Recently, other factors that are less oncogenic have been shown to be suitable substitutes for c-myc, such as Gliss1 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Maekawa et al., 2011</a>). These substitutes may be useful in future studies in non-mammalian species. A recent study also showed that an intermediate state of stem cell induction can exist, by using just a few of the transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lin et al., 2011</a>). Different from our iPSC-like cells they did not successfully achieve pluripotency in vivo. Thus, our cells appear to, at least, be further along in the programming stage than these cells."

First, the induction of stem cell characteristics was less prominent than in the vertebrates. When embryoid bodies were generated, they did so at a much lower rate with <i>Drosophila</i> cells than with the vertebrate cells. Putative endogenous homolog expression did not occur in two of the genes for the S2 cells and in another three for the BG2 cells. Second, proliferation was enhanced, but the starting S2 cells were already relatively proliferative. This difference might be because S2 cells are partially differentiated, aneuploid, renewable cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Moutinho-Pereira et al., 2010</a>). As such, these cells are a work-horse type of cell line, such as HeLa cells for humans, more so than true primary somatic cells. One interpretation of these findings is that the S2 cells underwent transdifferentiation as a result of the presence of mammalian stem cell genes, but for a stem cell state; that is switching from one highly proliferative state to another. Altogether, the findings suggest that the closer the relationship to mammals, the more reprogrammed characteristics the cells showed."

It is possible that a stem cell gene regulatory network and the stem cells themselves share more conserved molecular similarities than differentiated divergent cells. This idea is supported by the fact that Oct4 has been shown to regulate some of the same genes, including Sox2, in mammals and fish (<a href=\"#bib56\">Onichtchouk et al., 2010</a>), and embryonic cells and the three germ layers are more similar to each other in distantly related organisms than their adult cells, which are more divergent (<a href=\"#bib59\">Parikh et al., 2010</a>). This is further supported by the finding that the iPSC features were maintained in the vertebrate cells even after the mouse transgenes were suppressed. As such, our findings suggest that stem cells could represent a primordial animal cell state conserved across the animal kingdom. This can be tested by comparing the transcriptomes of iPSCs and more differentiated cell types across species."

Before we performed detailed analyses on multiple transfections, viral transduction efficiency values were assessed at three different STEMCCA concentrations in 48 well plates and cell colony forming units quantified in the vertebrate species (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We measured 11 independently transduced plates, and analyzed differences based on titer and species. Based on these initial transduction experiments, most subsequent transductions were performed at 10<sup>8</sup> U/ml for mouse and 9.5 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> U/ml for all other species (birds, fish, fly) to achieve similar colony forming unit levels as starting points for our analyses. For subsequent analysis, in order to achieve statistical confidence, we transfected 12 to 30 wells seeded with primary cells, in seven different independent experiments. Each well was independently transfected. Samples of the cells were then extracted at various time points, to identify the presence of exogenous or endogenous genes and proteins, via RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, respectively.

To discriminate between endogenous and exogenous expression of the stem cell genes across species, different primers were generated for mouse and the non-mammalian species, using non-overlapping sequences. To discriminate between mouse exogenous and endogenous genes, primers to the WPRE region of the vector were used. Using this strategy, the estimated relative amount of endogenous expression was calculated as the expression level of the WPRE segment subtracted from the total RNA of the mouse specific transcription factors. Primer sequences are listed in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>. The reactions were performed in a Cx96 real-time machine (BioRad). Cycling conditions were 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 60\u00b0C for 1 min.

The results were normalized to the endogenous 18S expression and to the gene expression level of the control fibroblast/primary cell groups using the \u0394\u0394CT method common for RT-PCR analyses.

Embryos injected with 5000 cells had better incorporation results. Surrogate shells were prepared from organic eggs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borwompinyo et al., 2005</a>) 1 day after being laid. Briefly, the tops of surrogate egg shells were cut off, and eggs were emptied and cleaned with PBS, pH 7.1. Once the experimental (donor) eggs were injected, they were transferred into the surrogate shells. Additional albumin was added if necessary, to completely cover the egg. Finally, the egg was sealed with cling film."

The cell mixture was placed in a borosilicate glass needle fitted to an Eppendorf CellTram Microinjector.

This is why this was just one test of many, including assessing other markers, such as Oct4, Nanog, and the endogenous homologs of the stem cell inducing genes, and differentiating the cells in-vivo and in-vitro. It is possible and probable that only a subset of the ALP and SSEA1 labeled cells express Oct4 and Nanog. We have now revised the text and cited Brambrink et al to note that a proportion of induced cells express Oct4 and Nanog, even in mouse cells. We note, however, that our mouse control iPSC had similar ALP and SSEA1 labeling as the other vertebrate species. We also note that even if there is a smaller proportion of iPSC-like cells, like in mice, we are able to generate chimeric avian embryos with them. In terms of single example clones in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, we had mentioned the efficiency in the submitted paper was 20% of the wells transfected, and that included the mouse cells. With our modified media conditions, we can now obtain efficiencies over 90% of the wells transfected and have now noted this in the revised paper. These findings suggest that the efficiency is independent of mammalian genes inducing iPSC-like state in non-mammalian species, but more dependent on the media conditions used to transform the cells."

The two studies quoted by the reviewers that demonstrate a more efficient super-induction method of the stem cell factor genes were published after we had began our study. Therefore, our induction levels are similar to the mouse when using the same method. We have made this clarification in the paper, and discussed the possibility of trying modified methods that have since enhanced induction in mice and human cells, could potentially do so in non-mammalian species.

Interestingly, we further note that we used mouse and chicken ES cells as controls, and unlike the Takahashi findings we did not find induction of the endogenous genes in the mouse iPS cells above the ES controls, but instead induction to similar levels as the controls, and still well above the starting fibroblast levels. Our comparisons with fibroblasts are, however, consistent with previous work that has compared expression of these genes in somatic cell lines to levels in iPS and ES cells (<a href=\"#bib67\">Soldner et al., 2009</a>). These have shown an induction of 500-1000-fold (for Oct-4, Sox-2, and NANOG), as opposed to our 100\u2013500 fold increase (for Oct-4 and Sox-2) and 10\u2013100 increase in NANOG.

Although this is not a 100\u20131000-fold increase, a 10\u201350 fold increase of gene expression in a cell is still a very large change. In addition, there is no overlap of the expression levels of these two genes with the embryonic fibroblast controls, which we noted above were not zero. In the fish cells the Oct4 expression is also 10-fold above the controls, with a similar significant difference with 5 independent replicates (p&lt;0.001). Nanog, however, we report as not at all upregulated in the fish cells, and we cite papers that show that Nanog is also not necessary or even regulated at high levels in normal fish stem cells. Thus, in the Discussion we suggest that this represents a species difference. Most importantly, these differences between species or lower levels of induced Oct4 and NANOG expression relative to the mice and chicken cells was still sufficient to generate iPS-like quail, finch, and fish cells that can form embryoid bodies. Further, without NANOG upregulation in the fish iPS-like cells, they can still differentiate in fish embryos. And we now show that the quail cells can form teratomas. Thus, we conclude that is it is not necessary for these genes to be induced 100\u20131000 fold in order for the cells to be pluripotent in-vitro or in-vivo."
