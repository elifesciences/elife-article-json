Here, we establish a paternal effect model based on nicotine exposure in mice, enabling pharmacological interrogation of the specificity of the offspring response. Paternal exposure to nicotine prior to reproduction induced a broad protective response to multiple xenobiotics in male offspring. This effect manifested as increased survival following injection of toxic levels of either nicotine or cocaine, accompanied by hepatic upregulation of xenobiotic processing genes, and enhanced drug clearance. Surprisingly, this protective effect could also be induced by a nicotinic receptor antagonist, suggesting that xenobiotic exposure, rather than nicotinic receptor signaling, is responsible for programming offspring drug resistance. Thus, paternal drug exposure induces a protective phenotype in offspring by enhancing metabolic tolerance to xenobiotics."

Here, we establish a paternal effect model based on nicotine exposure in mice, enabling pharmacological interrogation of the specificity of the offspring response. Paternal exposure to nicotine prior to reproduction induced a broad protective response to multiple xenobiotics in male offspring. This effect manifested as increased survival following injection of toxic levels of either nicotine or cocaine, accompanied by hepatic upregulation of xenobiotic processing genes, and enhanced drug clearance. Surprisingly, this protective effect could also be induced by a nicotinic receptor antagonist, suggesting that xenobiotic exposure, rather than nicotinic receptor signaling, is responsible for programming offspring drug resistance. Thus, paternal drug exposure induces a protective phenotype in offspring by enhancing metabolic tolerance to xenobiotics."

In the experiments, some male mice were given water with nicotine in it over the course of five weeks. Later, the offspring of these mice were exposed to nicotine to see whether they were more or less sensitive to it than offspring of unexposed males. It turns out the mice with nicotine-exposed fathers have a higher resistance to the toxic effects of nicotine and, unexpectedly, to toxic levels of cocaine as well. This suggests that the pups of nicotine-exposed fathers are not specifically programmed to respond to nicotine, but instead are more resistant to toxins in general."

Studies in humans will be needed to confirm whether a father\u2019s nicotine use affects children the same way it does mice.

Paternal effect paradigms are of particular mechanistic interest in mammals, given that it is challenging to disentangle maternal environment effects on the oocyte epigenome from effects on uterine provisioning during offspring development. In contrast, in many paternal effect paradigms, males contribute little more than sperm to the offspring, simplifying the search for the mechanistic underpinnings of paternal effects on children. A large number of paternal exposure paradigms have been used to show that a father\u2019s diet can affect metabolic phenotypes in the next generation (<a href=\"#bib11\">McPherson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Rando, 2012</a>), while another large group of studies link paternal stress (using paradigms such as social defeat stress, or early maternal separation) to anxiety-related behaviors and cortisol release in offspring (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bale, 2015</a>). Finally, a growing number of toxins and drugs have been shown to induce effects on various offspring phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Skinner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Vassoler et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Yohn et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Zeybel et al., 2012</a>)."

This challenge is compounded by the fact that many of the stimuli used for paternal effect paradigms \u2013 low protein and high fat diets, social stressors, and endocrine disruptors \u2013 have pleiotropic effects on organismal physiology. We therefore sought to develop a paternal effect paradigm based on a defined ligand-receptor interaction, to enable pharmacological interrogation of the specificity of the offspring phenotype. Nicotine is a commonly-used drug in humans, and acts by binding to and activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), ligand-gated cation channels normally activated by the endogenous neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Maternal use of nicotine has been linked to multiple phenotypes in offspring (<a href=\"#bib23\">Yohn et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Zhu et al., 2014</a>), and although effects of paternal nicotine exposure have been less-studied, paternal smoking in humans has been suggested to affect metabolic phenotypes in children (<a href=\"#bib13\">Pembrey et al., 2006</a>)."

We found that paternal exposure to nicotine induced a protective response in the next generation, as male offspring of nicotine-exposed fathers exhibited significant protection from nicotine toxicity. Importantly, this toxin resistance was not specific to nicotine, instead reflecting a more general xenobiotic response \u2013 offspring of nicotine-exposed fathers exhibited increased hepatic expression of a variety of genes involved in clearance of xenobiotics, and these animals were resistant to cocaine as well as to nicotine toxicity. Finally, we found that enhanced resistance to nicotine toxicity was also observed in offspring of males treated with the nicotine antagonist mecamylamine, strongly suggesting that drug resistance in offspring is a common outcome of paternal exposure to multiple xenobiotics rather than a specific response arising from nicotine signaling. Taken together, our results describe a novel paternal effect paradigm, and demonstrate that in the case of paternal nicotine exposure, the phenotype observed in offspring is a relatively generic response \u2013 enhanced xenobiotic resistance \u2013 rather than a selective downregulation of the specific molecular pathway subject to paternal perturbation."

Briefly, after acclimating animals to a saline injection protocol for three days, animals are injected with either nicotine (1.5 mg/kg) or saline, and immediately introduced to a novel environment. Saline-injected animals actively explore the novel environment, and locomotor activity is quantified over a 40 min time course (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> \u2013 Baseline). In this paradigm, injection of nicotine results in rapid suppression of locomotor activity, followed by a gradual recovery of exploratory behavior over the time course of the assay. Using this assay, we observed no significant difference in nicotine sensitivity between TA and NIC offspring, either for male or female offspring (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Animals were first acclimated to intraperitoneal saline injections once a day for three days. On day three (Baseline), offspring were injected with saline, then placed in a novel environment \u2013 a box equipped with infrared photodiodes to enable detection of locomotor activity. Saline-injected animals actively explore the novel environment, and locomotor activity is quantitated over a 40 or 90 min time course by the number of times the animal interrupts the light beam. Exploratory behavior decreases over time in saline-injected animals as they fully explore the enclosure. On nine subsequent days (data for four representative days are shown in each column), animals are injected with nicotine (1.5 or 2.0 mg/kg, as indicated) and immediately introduced to the measurement box. In this paradigm, injection of nicotine results in rapid suppression of locomotor activity, followed by a gradual recovery of exploratory behavior over the time course of the assay.

Several lines of evidence thus argue against the drug resistance of NIC offspring resulting from altered neural physiology. First, the fact that drug-acclimated animals exhibit enhanced resistance to both nicotine and cocaine toxicity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>) rules out mechanisms involving downregulation or desensitization of either nicotinic acetylcholine receptors or the dopamine receptor. Second, RNA-Seq analysis of several brain regions \u2013 hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex -- revealed minimal effects of paternal nicotine exposure on the transcriptome. Finally, we found no significant differences in staining patterns of the activity marker c-fos in the hippocampus of TA and NIC offspring. Thus, while we cannot definitively rule out a neural basis for the phenotypes observed in NIC offspring, we found no evidence to support such a hypothesis."

As the liver is the primary site of nicotine and other xenobiotic clearance in mammals, we investigated changes in mRNA abundance in hepatocytes isolated from TA and NIC offspring (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Paternal nicotine exposure significantly (adjusted p&lt;0.05) affected the expression levels of 51 genes, with upregulated genes being significantly enriched for those involved in lipid metabolism (p=3.9e-14), amino acid catabolism (p=6.6e-8), and various mitochondrial annotations including mitochondrial membrane (p=1.9e-7) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>). Most notably, given the nicotine resistance observed at the organismal level, NIC hepatocytes also exhibited increased expression of genes involved in drug metabolism (p=4.3e-6), with upregulated genes including \u2018Phase I\u2019 (<i>Cyp1a2</i>, <i>Cyp2c68</i>) and \u2018Phase II\u2019 (<i>Ugt2a3</i>, <i>Ugt2b1</i>, <i>Sult1d1</i>, and <i>Sult1a1</i>) detoxification enzymes, \u2018Phase III\u2019 membrane transporters (<i>Slco1a4</i>), as well as genes encoding the xenobiotic-responsive nuclear hormone receptors CAR and PXR (<i>Nr1h3</i> and <i>Nr1i2</i>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D</a>). In addition, the primary cytochrome involved in nicotine clearance in rodents, <i>Cyp2a5</i>, was upregulated\u00a0~2 fold on average in NIC hepatocytes. Although this upregulation was not significant (adjusted p=0.2) in the genome-wide dataset due to sample to sample variability in expression of this gene, we validated upregulation of <i>Cyp2a5</i> in additional intact livers (n\u00a0=\u00a06 NIC, n\u00a0=\u00a04 TA, p&lt;0.01) by q-RT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

To investigate the mechanistic basis for this derepression, we characterized open chromatin genome-wide in TA and NIC hepatocytes (n\u00a0=\u00a08 samples each) using ATAC-Seq (<a href=\"#bib3\">Buenrostro et al., 2015</a>). Our ATAC-Seq dataset exhibited expected features such as strong peaks of accessibility over promoters and other regulatory elements (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Comparing TA and NIC datasets, we observed a consistent global difference in overall chromatin accessibility \u2013 normalized ATAC peaks at regulatory elements were nearly 2-fold higher in NIC hepatocytes than in TA hepatocytes, while TA hepatocytes exhibited a consistently higher background of transposition throughout regions of the genome distant from regulatory elements (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>). Whatever the basis for this global change in chromatin accessibility, we additionally identified 1861 peaks of chromatin accessibility (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3D\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>) that differ significantly between TA and NIC hepatocytes after correcting for the global difference in peak height between these samples. Consistent with the changes in mRNA abundance observed in hepatocytes, these peaks were significantly enriched near genes involved in lipid metabolism (p=2.8e-18) and xenobiotic metabolism (p=1.3e-6), along with many related GO categories. We conclude that a history of paternal drug exposure can influence the chromatin landscape of hepatocytes in offspring, resulting in a broad increase in accessibility at regulatory elements involved in metabolism and detoxification."

In other words, does pre-acclimation of NIC offspring to different molecules induce resistance specifically to the drug to which the animals were exposed, or do chronic exposures to multiple distinct drugs all induce a common state of general xenobiotic resistance? To distinguish these possibilities, we pre-acclimated TA and NIC offspring to either nicotine or cocaine, then challenged acclimated animals with a lethal dose of the drug to which they had not yet been exposed. Consistent with the hypothesis that drug acclimation induces a general xenobiotic response, we found that pre-acclimation to nicotine induced a cocaine-resistant phenotype in NIC offspring, and, conversely, that chronic cocaine could induce nicotine resistance (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013C</a>).

Curiously, the relative upregulation of xenobiotic processing genes (XPGs) in NIC offspring was observed in hepatocytes and livers isolated from \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 animals that had not been exposed to nicotine or cocaine (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), yet enhanced resistance to toxins was only observed in animals that were first acclimated to one of these drugs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). To test the hypothesis that XPG upregulation might be even stronger in NIC hepatocytes following drug exposure, we set out to characterize gene expression changes in nicotine- or cocaine-acclimated offspring. However, in attempting to isolate hepatocytes from drug-acclimated TA and NIC offspring for RNA-Seq analysis, we noticed much poorer recovery of hepatocytes from TA than from NIC offspring (not shown), suggesting the possibility that NIC animals might be protected from drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Therefore, to quantify cell viability in vivo, we took a histochemical approach to assess apoptosis in livers from drug-acclimated TA and NIC offspring. Consistent with the relatively poor recovery of hepatocytes from TA animals, we observed substantial hepatocyte death in the livers of cocaine-exposed animals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Importantly, while hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis were extremely common in livers from cocaine-exposed TA offspring, NIC offspring were significantly protected from such cocaine toxicity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We conclude that the upregulation of XPGs in na\u00efve NIC offspring is not sufficient to significantly protect animals from a lethal nicotine or cocaine challenge, but that this upregulation can protect hepatocytes from sub-lethal doses of these drugs. Following a week of chronic toxin exposure, TA offspring are left with substantially reduced liver function, while NIC offspring maintain greater numbers of functional hepatocytes. We speculate that this greater hepatocyte functional capacity, as well as the upregulation of XPGs in hepatocytes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), may both serve to protect the animal from a single toxic dose of xenobiotic."

Thus, it is plausible that nicotine exposure affects epigenetic modification of the Y chromosome to program drug resistance in male offspring (or, less simply, that epigenetic marks on the X chromosome suppress an autosomal or small RNA-directed phenotype that would otherwise affect both male and female progeny). Second, X chromosome dosage compensation in mammals occurs via silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in females. The inactive X chromosome could thus act as a \u2018sink\u2019 for epigenetic silencing machinery in females (<a href=\"#bib2\">Blewitt et al., 2005</a>), such that the effective levels of this machinery available for autosomal gene regulation could differ between males and females. In this scenario, paternal transmission of an epigenetically-marked autosomal locus, or RNA, could cause differential effects in developing male vs. female offspring based on differences in the available levels of epigenetic effector machinery. Finally, we note that an emerging theme in many paternal effect paradigms is that the phenotypic changes observed in offspring are known to be regulated by various nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs). For example, the phenotypes described in paternal stress paradigms are related to glucocorticoid receptor signaling, while the metabolic gene expression changes resulting from paternal dietary interventions exhibit significant overlap with genes regulated by NHRs such as PPAR\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carone et al., 2010</a>). Here, we find that paternal nicotine exposure affects hepatic expression of many targets of metabolic NHRs, as well as the xenobiotic-responsive NHRs CAR and PXR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). As sex hormones also act through NHR signaling \u2013 androgen receptor and estrogen receptor \u2013 we speculate that levels or activity of NHR coactivators or corepressors could differ in male vs. female progeny, resulting in altered penetrance or magnitude of paternal effects on NHR-mediated gene regulation."

NIC hepatocytes exhibit derepression of xenobiotic response genes even before exposure to any drugs, yet these drug-na\u00efve animals are no more resistant to nicotine or cocaine toxicity than control animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5A</a>). Instead, the enhanced xenobiotic metabolism in NIC livers appears to protect susceptible hepatocytes from toxicity during a course of sublethal drug exposure (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The loss of hepatocytes in drug-exposed TA animals presumably explains why fewer than 50% of these animals survive an LD50 dose \u2013 calculated using drug-na\u00efve animals \u2013 of nicotine or cocaine (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>), with the preservation of hepatic capacity in NIC offspring preventing this degradation in survivability. That said, not only do drug-acclimated NIC offspring simply <i>preserve</i> their survival in the face of an LD50 dose of these drugs, but they exhibit dramatically <i>improved</i> survival, as far more than half of these animals survive this challenge. We have yet to uncover the mechanistic basis for this enhanced survival, as RNA-Seq analysis of the hepatocytes isolated from drug-acclimated animals does not reveal further upregulation of XPGs than that documented for na\u00efve hepatocytes (not shown). Future studies will investigate whether drug acclimation might (1) affect mRNA abundance in a limited subset of hepatocytes (which would be diluted out in whole liver or hepatocyte culture experiments), (2) affect mRNA abundance only transiently during drug exposure (and not in cultured hepatocytes), leaving behind higher levels of the encoded proteins without an mRNA-Seq signature, or (3) affect xenobiotic metabolism not at the level of mRNA abundance, but post-transcriptionally."

A key question in this regard is whether stress experienced by the nicotine-exposed males might be responsible for inducing the offspring phenotype, as it is known that a variety of paternal stress exposure paradigms \u2013 including early maternal separation, social defeat stress, and chronic variable low level stress \u2013 affect multiple phenotypes in offspring, from glucose control to anxiety-related behaviors (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bale, 2015</a>). While we have not formally ruled out a role for paternal stress in our system \u2013 it will of course be of interest to assay offspring nicotine resistance in well-studied paternal stress paradigms \u2013 two findings strongly argue against this paternal effect arising from a general stress response. First, chronic exposure to the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine, which blocks nicotine dependence in nicotine-treated fathers, does not interfere with induction of xenobiotic resistance in offspring (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), thus definitively ruling out a role for paternal withdrawal stress in induction of this phenotype. This first point is further supported by the finding that mecamylamine alone \u2013 which on its own has little effect on anxiety, locomotor behavior, or physical withdrawal symptoms in nicotine-na\u00efve mice (<a href=\"#bib26\">Zhao-Shea et al., 2013</a>) \u2013 is sufficient to induce xenobiotic resistance in offspring. Second, in contrast to multiple reported paternal stress paradigms, we do not find any evidence that paternal nicotine exposure affects anxiety-related behavior in offspring (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Paternal effects on toxin resistance in offspring did not require nicotinic receptor signaling, as both nicotine itself as well as a nicotine antagonist were able to induce the protective response in offspring. As both nicotine and mecamylamine exposure can result in reduction of nAChR signaling via desensitization or antagonism, respectively, it is formally possible that nAChR deactivation is the inciting stimulus in the paternal generation (or, less likely, that the surgical stress of mecamylamine infusion pump implantation, and nicotine consumption, both convergently induce the same effect in offspring). However, we favor the simpler hypothesis that both of these molecules serve to program offspring drug resistance via effects on paternal xenobiotic sensing. This model naturally raises the question of how xenobiotic exposure is sensed. As a diverse variety of xenobiotics can affect gene regulation via activation of the NHRs CAR and PXR, these NHRs represent appealing candidates for the relevant xenobiotic sensor in fathers."

Do nicotine and mecamylamine somehow induce a switch-like \u2018all or none\u2019 change in some epigenetic mark that is not present in control sperm, or is the overall activity level of a xenobiotic sensor translated into quantitative changes in the levels of some continuous signal present in sperm? In the former case, what aspects of a given exposure paradigm are required to induce alterations to the sperm epigenome? We offer that one appealing mechanism for sensing increased levels of environmental xenobiotics would rely on comparing changes in sensor activity over an animal\u2019s lifetime. For instance, if CAR/PXR signaling early in life \u2013 in utero perhaps, or early in postnatal life \u2013 were to result in a long-lasting \u2018setpoint\u2019 for the levels of CAR/PXR activity expected later in life, then the organism could detect increased xenobiotic exposure later in life via changes in overall CAR/PXR activity compared to this setpoint. Future studies will explore the nature of the \u2018nicotine\u2019 sensor in the paternal generation, and how information about exposure history is transmitted to offspring."

Our data also reveal broad metabolic gene expression changes in NIC offspring, with potential implications for metabolic and cardiovascular health of offspring. Future studies will determine whether paternal nicotine exposure affects offspring via epigenetic marks in the sperm (vs. seminal fluid, etc.), and how paternally-transmitted information alters the course of development to result in xenobiotic-resistant hepatocytes. It will also be of interest to extend these studies to human populations, where the longer half-life of nicotine could potentially result in self-administration phenotypes not observed in the mouse model."

Blunt preparation was used to create a subcutaneous canal between the two incisions. Subsequently, the vena jugularis dextra was located and a catheter (2Fr, PV 10 cm, Instech Labs) was inserted and gently pushed forward into the vena cava superior, where it remained for the length of the study. The catheter was ligated to the vein using Ethibond Excel 4.0. The distal end of the catheter was connected to a button (25 G, VAB, Instech. Labs), which was placed subcutaneously in an intrascapular position for easy access. After verifying that there was no leakage, the incision sites were closed with Ethibond Excel 4.0.

Afterwards, mice were put on a caloric restriction diet (85% w/w of regular 24 hr consumption) three days prior to start of the experiment. We preconditioned animals on sucrose pellets in a 60 min session once a day for seven consecutive days, whereby animals learned to nose-poke the active portal in a self-administration chamber in order to receive food reward. The number of nose-pokes required to get a sucrose pellet escalated starting with a fixed ratio of 1:1 (FR1) up to a fixed ratio of 5:1 (FR5). Only animals that had successfully been conditioned on sucrose pellets advanced to the testing phase, during which they administered nicotine to themselves through the implanted catheter. Catheter patency was verified daily by aspiration of blood and subsequent heparin infusion. Animals with blocked or dislocated catheters were excluded from the study. The self-administered nicotine doses started with 0.03 mg/kg/injection for 4 days, then 0.1 mg/kg/injection for 8 days, 0.25 mg/kg/injection for 8 days, and 0.4 mg/kg/injection for 8 days. The number of nose-pokes of the active versus the inactive portal, as well as the number of injections administered, were recorded and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 and multiple t-tests with Holm-Sidak correction.

After filtration through a 70 \u00b5m nylon cell strainer, cells were washed twice with PBS 1X and once with culture media (centrifugation at 500 rpm for 5 min), and plated on a 0.1% gelatin-coated well. Hepatocytes were allowed to adhere to the bottom of the well for three hours. Nonadherent cells were then removed, and fresh culture medium was then added, initiating our time course (T0, T1, T3, T21 hours). Cells were collected after a PBS 1X wash by adding TriZol to the well for RNA experiments."

The next day, samples were dehydrated in a series of escalating ethanol solutions starting with 70% and ending with 100%, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (4 \u00b5m slices), each section containing all four lobes, which were then mounted onto a glass slide. For H/E staining, slices were de-parafinized, incubated with xylene and a series of descending ethanol solutions. Incubation times for Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% Eosin Y (Sigma-Aldrich) were 30 s and 20 s, respectively. After dewaxing of tissue, TUNEL staining was performed following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (in Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD, Roche). Apoptotic areas per lobe were counted under a light microscope with 20X magnification at five different levels through the sample and analyzed with Image J."

While this phenomenon has been clearly demonstrated in multiple ways, this paper is of particular interest and novelty. In particular, the authors use a paternal effect paradigm that involves a highly specific stimulus, nicotine, as opposed to more general metabolic stimuli, which permits them to analyze the specificity of the phenomenon. The most interesting observation is that the response in the subsequent generation is not specific for the original stimulus, but rather a more general xenobiotic response. This conclusion is validated by a considerable phenotyping. The authors also make the surprising observation that both nicotine and a nicotine antagonist of can induce this response. The paper also provides an initial mechanistic understanding in that the reprogammed mice increase nicotine clearance and hepatocytes show a transcriptional response linked to xenobiotic resistance. While the paper is somewhat limited in mechanistic understanding for how a specific stimulus results in a broader xenobiotic response, the phenomenon is important and there is enough mechanistic information to make the paper suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i>."
