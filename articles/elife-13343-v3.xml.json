                    "text": "We investigated the structural development of superficial-layers of medial entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum in rats. The grid-layout and cholinergic-innervation of calbindin-positive pyramidal-cells in layer-2 emerged around birth while reelin-positive stellate-cells were scattered throughout development. Layer-3 and parasubiculum neurons had a transient calbindin-expression, which declined with age. Early postnatally, layer-2 pyramidal but not stellate-cells co-localized with doublecortin \u2013 a marker of immature neurons \u2013 suggesting delayed functional-maturation of pyramidal-cells. Three observations indicated a dorsal-to-ventral maturation of entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum: (i) calbindin-expression in layer-3 neurons decreased progressively from dorsal-to-ventral, (ii) doublecortin in layer-2 calbindin-positive-patches disappeared dorsally before ventrally, and (iii) wolframin-expression emerged earlier in dorsal than ventral parasubiculum. The early appearance of calbindin-pyramidal-grid-organization in layer-2 suggests that this pattern is instructed by genetic information rather than experience. Superficial-layer-microcircuits mature earlier in dorsal entorhinal cortex, where small spatial-scales are represented. Maturation of ventral-entorhinal-microcircuits \u2013 representing larger spatial-scales \u2013 follows later around the onset of exploratory behavior."

The grid-layout and cholinergic-innervation of calbindin-positive pyramidal-cells in layer-2 emerged around birth while reelin-positive stellate-cells were scattered throughout development. Layer-3 and parasubiculum neurons had a transient calbindin-expression, which declined with age. Early postnatally, layer-2 pyramidal but not stellate-cells co-localized with doublecortin \u2013 a marker of immature neurons \u2013 suggesting delayed functional-maturation of pyramidal-cells. Three observations indicated a dorsal-to-ventral maturation of entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum: (i) calbindin-expression in layer-3 neurons decreased progressively from dorsal-to-ventral, (ii) doublecortin in layer-2 calbindin-positive-patches disappeared dorsally before ventrally, and (iii) wolframin-expression emerged earlier in dorsal than ventral parasubiculum. The early appearance of calbindin-pyramidal-grid-organization in layer-2 suggests that this pattern is instructed by genetic information rather than experience. Superficial-layer-microcircuits mature earlier in dorsal entorhinal cortex, where small spatial-scales are represented. Maturation of ventral-entorhinal-microcircuits \u2013 representing larger spatial-scales \u2013 follows later around the onset of exploratory behavior."

This ability relies on a kind of memory known as spatial memory, which provides a map of the outside world within the animal\u2019s brain. Specifically, cells in a part of the brain called the medial entorhinal cortex act like the grids present on a map, and are known as grid cells. Other cells in this region represent boundaries in the environment and are known as border cells. These cells and other cells connect to each other to make the spatial memory circuit."

For example, cells that were most likely to become grid cells, were already laid out in a grid, indicating that this layout is instructed by genetic information rather than experience."

Further analysis then revealed that the circuits in the top part of the medial entorhinal cortex, which represents nearby areas, matured earlier than those in the bottom part of this region, which represent farther areas. These findings could therefore explain why rats explore nearby areas earlier in life before going on to explore further away areas at later stages."

Periodic patterns are ubiquitous in nature, and several chemical patterning systems have been explained on the basis of interaction between dynamical systems (<a href=\"#bib43\">Turing, 1952</a>). Since it has been suggested that the grid layout of calbindin+ neurons is functionally relevant for grid cell activity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brecht, 2014</a>), it would be interesting to investigate, whether genetic manipulations would result in changes of layout periodicity and have functional effects. The dendritic clustering of calbindin+ pyramidal neurons is similar to dendritic development in the neocortex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Petit et al., 1988</a>) and is established by the end of the first postnatal week. The cholinergic innervation of the calbindin+ patches was present by P4 in line with other long-range connectivity patterns in the MEC (<a href=\"#bib31\">O\u2019Reilly et al., 2015</a>), which are also established early in development."

Taken together with the presence of radial neuronal migration promoting Cajal-Retzius cells in layer 1 during this period, it would be interesting to investigate whether the transient calbindin+ neurons are migrating to layer 2 or changing their phenotype to reelin+ neurons, and what layer and cell-type specific functional differences are observed in this early postnatal development stage."

Transient expression of calbindin has been observed in early postnatal development in the neocortex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hogan and Berman, 1993</a>) and midbrain regions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu and Graybiel, 1992</a>), but its functional significance remains largely unknown. Our data show, however, that at early developmental stages the parasubiculum and medial entorhinal cortex share a similar organization in calbindin+ patches. Additionally, the expression of wolframin in the parasubiculum persists in adults, while calbindin+ neurons in MEC layer 2 also exhibit wolframin (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kitamura et al., 2014</a>) from the end of the first postnatal week. Current studies generally focus on cell-type specific investigations using proteins expressed by these cells. However, investigations to study the specific roles of these proteins (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 1995</a>) might provide interesting insights towards understanding the finer differences in the functionalities exhibited by these cells. For instance, calbindin is a calcium buffer, and reduces the concentration of intracellular calcium (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mattson et al., 1991</a>), while wolframin is implicated in increasing intracellular calcium levels (<a href=\"#bib30\">Osman et al., 2003</a>). With the medial entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum having many similarities in their spatial discharge properties (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boccara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tang et al., 2016</a>), a structure-function comparison of the wolframin+/transiently-calbindin+ neurons in the parasubiculum and the wolframin+/ permanently-calbindin+ neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex would be worthwhile."

This is coincident with the timeline of maturation of calbindin+ patches in the dorsal and ventral MEC respectively. Since the dorsal MEC represents smaller spatial scales and the ventral MEC progressively larger scales (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Stensola et al., 2012</a>), these data may indicate that the rat\u2019s navigational system matures from small to large scales.

The Introduction, Methods and Discussion are fine, even if the Discussion is a bit short. The Methods are good, but could be more detailed. The Results, however, need to be substantially revised or improved. One minor issue is that \"superficial layers\" need to be defined, even if most people know those are layers I to III, another issue are the tangential sections, that should be more clearly explained in the text. If a cortical area changes in size, by definition neuronal density decreases, this needs to be more clearly stated and discussed. The biggest issue is the presentation of the figures in the Results. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> shows changes in the size of the superficial layers, but also includes the deep layers. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>: the autocorrelation images need to be the same size as the insets of the immunohistochemical staining images to be acceptable and interpretable. The figure orientation is needed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; what is where? For instance, what is the band of bright staining on the right side of the image? The acetylcholinesterase activity staining is of low quality (at least in the images provided). Similarly, in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, images showing the sections at equal magnification would be helpful (orientation?). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> is of too low quality to be interpretable, doublecortin is supposed to stain neurons, which is not very visible in this figure. Taken together, this will make the data more understandable for readers; in the current version the images are not exceedingly helpful."

These cells are important elements of the microcircuitry that generates spatially-tuned discharge. Whether the histochemically identified Calbindin<sup>+</sup> cells correspond to functionally defined grid cells and/or border cells is controversial, which makes the present study an important contribution to the debate. The debate is crucial to notions of how the hippocampal-entorhinal system generates and computes information about space from the different functional components that have been identified such as distances, locations, directions, borders and speed. The development of the functional cell classes has been studied in recent years to constrain the theories, but which functionally-identified cells correspond to which histochemical and morphological cell classes is still unclear and clarification of this issue will provide important knowledge of the circuit wiring diagram that will drive theories of neural computation that are grounded in structure-function relationships. In summary, this manuscript is an important contribution."

Whether the sections are tangential or parasaggital, and knowledge of the precise cutting angles is important even for the specialist. Consequently, it would be valuable to provide a 3-D model of the brain or just the cortical region with indications of the tangential and parasaggital planes and to use these on the Figures as a short-hand to help orient the reader. I know this is asking too much, but I will mention it to make my point: a 3-D CLARITY image of the immunolabeled cells would go a long way towards showing this very cool grid-like organization to the non-specialist and specialist alike. A 3-D model could accomplish the same."

The data look clear and the interpretations of the measurements are not controversial. There are however a number of improvements I will suggest that will make the report more accessible to the general readership of eLife. 1) The analyses and interpretation of the histochemical images depend strongly on knowledge of the anatomical topography of the region, which non-specialists will not be. Whether the sections are tangential or parasaggital, and knowledge of the precise cutting angles is important even for the specialist. Consequently, it would be valuable to provide a 3-D model of the brain or just the cortical region with indications of the tangential and parasaggital planes and to use these on the Figures as a short-hand to help orient the reader. I know this is asking too much, but I will mention it to make my point: a 3-D CLARITY image of the immunolabeled cells would go a long way towards showing this very cool grid-like organization to the non-specialist and specialist alike. A 3-D model could accomplish the same.</i> We thank the reviewer for the idea of a 3D model, and have included a novel schematic video (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) to address these concerns."

We find a differential neuronal maturation profile, which indicates that the structural development of pyramidal and stellate cells, closely mirrors the differential functional maturation profiles of grid and border cells respectively."
