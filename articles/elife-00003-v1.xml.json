Sequestered on droplets under normal conditions, in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA), histones are released from the droplets and kill bacteria efficiently in vitro. Droplet-bound histones also function in vivo: when injected into <i>Drosophila</i> embryos lacking droplet-bound histones, bacteria grow rapidly. In contrast, bacteria injected into embryos with droplet-bound histones die. Embryos with droplet-bound histones displayed more than a fourfold survival advantage when challenged with four different bacterial species. Our data suggests that this intracellular antibacterial defense system may function in adult flies, and also potentially in mice."

Sequestered on droplets under normal conditions, in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA), histones are released from the droplets and kill bacteria efficiently in vitro. Droplet-bound histones also function in vivo: when injected into <i>Drosophila</i> embryos lacking droplet-bound histones, bacteria grow rapidly. In contrast, bacteria injected into embryos with droplet-bound histones die. Embryos with droplet-bound histones displayed more than a fourfold survival advantage when challenged with four different bacterial species. Our data suggests that this intracellular antibacterial defense system may function in adult flies, and also potentially in mice."

Now, Anand et al. have demonstrated that histones bound to lipid droplets can protect cells against bacteria without causing any of the harm normally associated with the presence of free histones. In in vitro experiments with lipid droplets purified from <i>Drosophila</i> embryos, they showed that histones bound to lipid droplets could be released to kill bacteria. The histones were released by lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid produced by the bacteria."

While most of the normal embryos survived, the vast majority of the embryos without droplet-bound histones died. Similar results were also found in experiments on adult flies, along with evidence which suggests that histones might also provide defenses against bacteria in mice."

While not generally appreciated, histones and histone fragments are surprisingly bactericidal in in vitro assays (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hirsch, 1958</a>). Thus, in principle histones could provide animals with a potent supply of microbicides for protection against bacterial invasion. In some cases, histones are released extracellularly, and then contribute to innate immunity against bacteria. For example, in the skin mucosa of catfish, secreted histone H2A contributes critically to the organismal defense against bacteria (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cho et al., 2002</a>), and histones H3 and H4 are prominent antimicrobial agents in sebaceous gland secretions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lee et al., 2009</a>)."

This infectious strategy allows evasion of many host innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, including antibody-based defenses in vertebrates. In principle, then, histones normally present in cells could confer protection against microbes that exploit intracellular niches. However, until now this has seemed unlikely for two reasons. First, histones typically are located in the nucleus, excluding contact with cytosolic bacteria. Second, histones are generally believed to be predominantly bound to DNA, with only minuscule amounts of excess histones. In fact, because unconfined histones cause genomic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, and lethality (<a href=\"#bib29\">Saffarzadeh et al., 2012</a>), cells minimize excess free histones by active mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib31\">Singh et al., 2009a</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2009b</a>). Given these constraints, it is not surprising that histone-mediated intracellular antibacterial responses have not been investigated extensively."

Embryos injected with bacteria have considerably higher survival success when they have droplet-bound histones, establishing that histones on LDs contribute to innate immunity in embryos. A similar survival advantage was observed in adult flies. Simulation of bacterial infection in mice induces histone accumulation on LDs in the liver, a key organ for fighting infection; this observation suggests that lipid droplet histones may represent an ancient host defense strategy."

When we found that there was a precedent for histone antibacterial activity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hirsch, 1958</a>), we hypothesized that the histones bound to the cytosolic LDs might act as an antibacterial system. To test whether LDs could indeed inhibit bacterial growth, we performed a traditional plate assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Thus, one potential source of antibacterial activity might be fatty acids released due to breakdown of the abundant triglycerides; because of their detergent-like properties, they might destroy bacterial membranes and thus impair bacterial viability. We therefore treated purified LDs with alkaline washes. This treatment removes electrostatically bound droplet proteins, but not lipids and proteins attached via hydrophobic interactions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brasaemle et al., 2004</a>). Indeed, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cermelli et al., 2006</a>), these washes greatly reduced the levels of the electrostatically bound histone H2B, but not of the hydrophobically bound LSD-2. These treated droplets no longer had antibacterial activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, LD-CaCO<sub>3</sub>), suggesting that the antimicrobial activity requires electrostatically bound proteins."

In principle, any of them might be responsible for the antibacterial activity, but it seems likely that the active agents would be present in high copy number. We thus performed a traditional gel overlay assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), visualizing these high-copy number proteins by Coomassie stain. Droplet proteins were separated by Acid Urea (AU) gel electrophoresis, and the gel was overlain with nutrient agar seeded with bacteria. As in the disc assay, antibacterial proteins diffuse into the agar and locally inhibit bacterial growth, as shown by the positive control mouse \u03b1-defensin cryptdin-4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, gel overlay violet arrow). The lipid-droplet lane contained significant antibacterial activity in only one location (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, gel overlay red arrow). MS analyses of proteins eluted from this location identified histones H2A and H2B as the predominant proteins present (spectra not shown). Therefore, the bactericidal activity of LDs is most likely due to histones, consistent with their known antimicrobial activities in vitro (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hirsch, 1958</a>). Importantly, pretreatment of purified LDs with anti-histone antibodies abolished or markedly reduced the droplet bactericidal activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, 1B-LD + Anti-histones).

First, using mass spectrometry, we compared post-translational modifications on droplet-bound and nuclear histones and found no major distinctions, suggesting that unique post translation modifications are not responsible for association of histones to LDs. Since our analysis was mostly qualitative, we cannot rule out the possibility that differences might arise from quantitative changes in post-translation modifications. We did identify several acetylation sites in histones H2A (serine 1 and lysines 5 and 8) and histone H2B (lysines 7, 11, 14 and 17). Some of these acetylation sites were previously found in shrimp histones (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ouvry-Patat and Schey, 2007</a>). The histones previously examined for antimicrobial activity are reported to be un-acetylated (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kim et al., 2000</a>), though there was no indication of whether acetylation affected antimicrobial efficacy. Second, we compared the antibacterial potencies of droplet-derived histones with commercial calf thymus histones isolated from a calf thymus nuclear fraction in both bactericidal (killing bacteria outright) and bacteriostatic (inhibiting the growth or reproduction of bacteria) activity assays. Histones extracted from droplets using AU gel electrophoresis were combined with a suspension of <i>E. coli</i> ML35 for 1 hr, and bacterial cell survival was determined by measuring CFU. This assay showed that histones are bactericidal and that droplet-derived histones and commercial pan-histones purified from calf thymus do not differ significantly in antibacterial efficacy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)."

We used two <i>Jabba</i> alleles, derived independently. <i>Jabba</i><sup><i>zl01</i></sup> is due to imprecise excision of a P element inserted near the <i>Jabba</i> promoter, and <i>Jabba</i><sup><i>f07560</i></sup> is due to the insertion of a PBac element in the middle of the <i>Jabba</i> coding region.

Further, lacking cytosolic bacteria, the systemic circulating LPS is unlikely to be present inside the cells at high enough dosage to release the histones from the droplets. In the second case, purified droplets with histones are exposed directly to LPS, mimicking the presence of bacteria inside of cells. In this latter case, there are no signaling effects, because in the purified system no signaling apparatus is present. Thus, this second assay looks only at the direct effect of high levels of LPS interacting with histones, causing the histones to release from the droplets."

As tested in the embryos, and in a limited way in adult flies, the system appears efficient, resulting in a more than fourfold improvement in survival for challenges by multiple types of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including the known intracellular pathogen <i>Listeria</i>. Histones and histone fragments had previously been reported to play a role in extracellular antibacterial defense (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fernandes et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">von Kockritz-Blickwede and Nizet, 2009</a>). We propose here that by using histone-droplet sequestration, cells can position histones in the cytosol, so that they are both available to interact with cytosolic bacteria, and also can evade constitutive pathways responsible for degrading free histones. Determining whether the murine droplet-bound histones actively contribute to host defense remains for future studies."

Such a role of droplets in the antibacterial response may in part explain why the number and size of LDs increase in disease, from osteoarthritis to liver degeneration and cartilage overproliferation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tilney and Portnoy, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bielecki et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lowder et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Figueredo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Yang et al., 2010</a>). In mammalian leukocytes and macrophages, LDs have already been suggested to participate in the regulation of the host response to infection, by modulating the production of inflammation mediators like eicosanoids (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bozza and Viola, 2010</a>). Our result discloses an additional role of droplets in innate immunity, a role potentially conserved from flies to mammals. Since many medically relevant bacterial pathogens enter the cytosol (e.g. <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Shigella flexneri</i>, <i>Burkholderia pseudomallei</i>, <i>Francisella tularensis</i> and <i>Rickettsia</i> spp; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ray et al., 2009</a>) and histones are also reported to have anti-fungal properties (<a href=\"#bib10\">De Lucca et al., 2011</a>), and many such pathogenic fungi also enter the cytosol (e.g., <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bliska and Casadevall, 2009</a>), it may be that the system described here has surprisingly wide utility."

At the same time, we noted how many such high-bacteria fields were typically present in an embryo, as well as typical bacterial counts in the other fields. We estimate the embryo can be covered by approximately 10 independent fields of 40 \u00b5 each. For the wild-type, at t = 2 hr, the average number of bacteria in the (maximal) field of view was 24.3 \u00b1 6.4, and there were between three and four such fields per embryo, with few bacteria elsewhere, leading to an estimate of \u223c84 bacteria per embryo.

In contrast, for the t = 48 <i>Jabba</i> embryo, every field was full of bacteria (200\u2013250 bacteria per field), so assuming 10 such fields we estimate 2000\u20132500 bacteria per embryo."

Alleles <i>Jabba</i><sup><i>zl01</i></sup> and <i>Jabba</i><sup><i>f07560</i></sup> were derived independently: <i>Jabba</i><sup><i>zl01</i></sup> is due to imprecise excision of a P element inserted near the Jabba promoter. <i>Jabba</i><sup><i>f07560</i></sup> is due to the insertion of a PBac element in the middle of the Jabba coding region. As the two alleles were generated in entirely different genetic backgrounds, this rules out any genetic background effects. This has now been clarified in the text."

Firstly, in the context of immunity, measuring the efficiency of an LPS infection is usually defined by cytokine response rather than hepatic injury.

We have not been able to do a bacterial killing assay with the murine droplets, because a great deal of research in Spain (where our collaborators are located) is currently on hold due to the financial crisis there; the mouse facility is closed for a month or two. Given our new data on whole-fly data, and the expected large delay in being able to carry out the murine-droplet killing assays, we propose to leave establishing the efficacy of the murine droplets for future work. Accordingly, this section has been toned down as suggested by the reviewers, and in particular, we now include the sentence: \u201cDetermining whether the murine droplet-bound histones actively contribute to host defense remains for future studies.\u201d"
