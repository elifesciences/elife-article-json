However, to date, no clinically relevant inhibitor of this cascade has been tested in experimental models of addiction, a necessary step toward clinical trials. We designed two new cell-penetrating peptides - RB1 and RB3 - that penetrate the brain and, in the micromolar range, inhibit phosphorylation of ERK, histone H3 and S6 ribosomal protein in striatal slices. Furthermore, a screening of small therapeutics currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy revealed PD325901 as a brain-penetrating drug that blocks ERK signalling in the nanomolar range. All three compounds have an inhibitory effect on cocaine-induced ERK activation and reward in mice. In particular, PD325901 persistently blocks cocaine-induced place preference and accelerates extinction following cocaine self-administration. Thus, clinically relevant, systemically administered drugs that attenuate Ras-ERK signalling in the brain may be valuable tools for the treatment of cocaine addiction."

However, to date, no clinically relevant inhibitor of this cascade has been tested in experimental models of addiction, a necessary step toward clinical trials. We designed two new cell-penetrating peptides - RB1 and RB3 - that penetrate the brain and, in the micromolar range, inhibit phosphorylation of ERK, histone H3 and S6 ribosomal protein in striatal slices. Furthermore, a screening of small therapeutics currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy revealed PD325901 as a brain-penetrating drug that blocks ERK signalling in the nanomolar range. All three compounds have an inhibitory effect on cocaine-induced ERK activation and reward in mice. In particular, PD325901 persistently blocks cocaine-induced place preference and accelerates extinction following cocaine self-administration. Thus, clinically relevant, systemically administered drugs that attenuate Ras-ERK signalling in the brain may be valuable tools for the treatment of cocaine addiction."

Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the experience of drugs of abuse depends on learned associations between drug-paired cues and the rewarding effects of these drugs (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sanchis-Segura and Spanagel, 2006</a>). Thus, preventing relapse following drug abstinence is impeded by the ability of drug-associated cues to persistently elicit drug-seeking behaviours (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belin et al., 2013</a>). As a consequence, conditioned drug cues may induce drug seeking and relapse behaviour. In the brain, cellular mechanisms and signalling pathways involved in normal learning and memory processes are usurped by addictive drugs; hence, memories encoding drug-paired cues resist extinction and contribute to high rates of relapse (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nestler, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Miller and Marshall, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Torregrossa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Itzhak et al., 2014</a>)."

The use of pharmacological inhibitors of MEK1/2, the kinases upstream of ERK1/2, has been essential in defining the role of ERK cascade in lasting experience- and drug-dependent alterations in behavioural plasticity. Until recently, the only available blood-brain barrier penetrating MEK inhibitor was SL327, but this drug has never been used in humans, most likely due to toxicity issues and to the relatively low IC50 (0.18/0.22\u00a0<i>\u03bc</i>M toward MEK1 and MEK2, respectively) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Atkins et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Scherle et al., 2000</a>). Another MEK inhibitor unable to pass the blood-brain barrier but still widely used via direct injection in the brain is U0126 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Favata et al., 1998</a>). Regardless, it has been shown that MEK inhibition prevents conditioned place preference (CPP) to cocaine and amphetamine (<a href=\"#bib68\">Valjent et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gerdjikov et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Miller and Marshall, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Valjent et al., 2006a</a>). Other studies have identified a key role for ERK in drug reinforcement using the self-administration paradigm. Cocaine self-administration has been demonstrated to increase ERK phosphorylation relative to saline controls in striatal regions that mediate reinforcement, including the nucleus accumbens shell (<a href=\"#bib17\">Edwards et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Miszkiel et al., 2014</a>). In addition, drug-seeking during exposure to cocaine-associated cues/contexts following the acquisition of self-administration has also been demonstrated to be ERK-dependent, although its role during cue and/or context exposure depends on a number of different factors, including the extent of cocaine training, brain region, and withdrawal duration (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Koya et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Edwards et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Whitfield et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Doyle et al., 2014</a>). One finding of particular interest showed that following cocaine self-administration, bilateral infusion of U0126 into the basolateral amygdala immediately after a short memory retrieval session, attenuated subsequent cocaine seeking. This treatment was associated with a transient decrease in phospho-ERK, suggesting an important role for ERK during memory retrieval in maintaining drug-associated memories (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wells et al., 2013</a>)."

Here, we report on two new cell-penetrating peptides able to attenuate the activation of this signalling cascade in response to cocaine. We further demonstrate that these two peptides prevent the formation of drug-associated memories in the CPP. We also demonstrate that PD325901, a potent MEK inhibitor already in clinical trials for cancer, was able to penetrate the brain and efficiently block Ras-ERK activation. Furthermore, a single in vivo administration of PD325901 persistently blocked a CPP response and significantly accelerated the extinction of cue-induced responding following cocaine self-administration."

The KIM sequence is responsible for the interaction with the common docking (CD) domain of ERK1/2. The second peptide, hereafter referred to as RB3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), was designed with the support of molecular graphics tools, taking advantage of the published crystal structure of a ternary Ras:SOS:Ras*GDP complex (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sondermann et al., 2004</a>), compared to the crystal structure of the CDC25 domain of Ras-GRF1, a neuronal specific Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Ras-GEF). The peptide sequence (1173\u20131203 portion of the CDC25 domain) includes an \u03b1-helix crucial for the GTP exchange activity on RAS proteins. To allow these peptides to cross cellular membranes and the blood-brain barrier, we added to their sequences a portion of the HIV TAT protein (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gump and Dowdy, 2007</a>), thus generating two distinct cell-penetrating peptides (<a href=\"#bib50\">Papale et al., 2012</a>)."

Therefore, those drugs represent ideal candidates for repositioning studies to address efficacy also for neuropsychiatric disorders such as drug addiction. In order to verify whether these clinically relevant inhibitors pass the blood-brain barrier, we tested the MEK1/2 inhibitors PD325901, Trametinib (GSK1102212) and Selumetinib (AZD6244), and the Raf inhibitor Dabrafenib (GSK2118436). The doses of the inhibitors, as indicated below, were selected on the basis of their previously reported effects on tumour formation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hennig et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gilmartin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hofmann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">King et al., 2013</a>). For all compounds we followed the same procedure: the inhibitor was given (i.p.) 1 hr prior a cocaine injection (25 mg/kg), and 5 min after cocaine administration mice were transcardially perfused, brains were harvested, and ERK phosphorylation was subsequently determined. An acute administration of PD325901 (25 mg/kg) completely abolished ERK phosphorylation in the ventral striatum (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In contrast, Trametinib (5 mg/kg) and Selumetinib (50 mg/kg) were not effective (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>), while Dabrafenib (50 mg/kg) had a partial but not significant effect on ERK phosphorylation in the ventral striatum (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

Cocaine (0.50 mg/kg in a 14 \u00b5l infusion) delivery was contingent upon pressing on the active lever under an FR1 schedule of reinforcement and paired with the 20 s presentation of a blinking light stimulus (CS), which also served as a timeout period, during which lever presses were not reinforced. Presses on the inactive lever were recorded but had no scheduled consequence. Twenty-four hours following the last cocaine self-administration session, mice were given a single 10-minutes CS-only retrieval session (day 8), preceded 30 min by a vehicle (10 ml/kg) or PD325901 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) injection, during which presses on the active lever were not reinforced, but the CS was presented. Beginning the following day, mice were presented with 10 daily 1-hr extinction sessions (days 9\u201318), during which presses on the active lever were not reinforced, but the CS was presented, to determine the effect of PD325901 administered during the short retrieval trial on subsequent cue responding. <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a> shows the timeline of the self-administration protocol. Prior to vehicle or MEK inhibitor treatment on day 8, both groups demonstrated similar acquisition of cocaine self-administration (days 1\u20137), as demonstrated by a similar number of lever presses (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>) and number of cocaine reinforcers achieved (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>) during 7 daily 1-hr sessions of cocaine SA (0.50 mg/kg/infusion). Furthermore, responding for the CS in the absence of cocaine during the 10-min retrieval trial preceded by vehicle or MEK inhibitor administration on day 8 also did not differ. However, mice pre-treated with PD325901 demonstrated a significant decrease in active lever responding relative to vehicle controls across 10 daily 1-hr CS-only extinction sessions (days 9\u201318; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). These data indicate that PD325901 administered prior to a brief CS-only retrieval trial had long-lasting consequences and attenuated subsequent responding in the presence of the CS."

It is a particularly appealing drug since it shows a high potency with a low IC50 in vivo. Moreover, compared to its predecessor CI-1040, PD325901 exhibits a greater solubility, leading to improved bioavailability and metabolic stability (<a href=\"#bib67\">Uehling and Harris, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wu and Park, 2015</a>). Consistent with this, PD325901 has demonstrated potent anticancer activity both in vitro, by inhibiting tumour cell proliferation, and in vivo, by suppressing tumour growth in a broad spectrum of xenograft models (<a href=\"#bib62\">Solit et al., 2006</a>). Based on these promising preclinical studies, PD325901 has been subsequently advanced into clinical trials. The effectiveness of PD325901 in patients has been evaluated in a Phase I/II trial for the treatment of colon cancer, breast cancer and melanoma (NCT00147550, Pfizer), in a Phase II study for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NCT00174369, Pfizer), and in another Phase II study in one previously-treated patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NCT02297802, Sharp Healthcare). In addition, several combination therapies using PD325901 have been evaluated in order to expand its clinical application (NCT01347866, Pfizer; Phase I, NCT02022982, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Phase I/II, NCT02039336, The Netherlands Cancer Institute; Phase I, NCT02510001, University of Oxford; NCT020096471, University of Alabama at Birmingham)."

Here, we speculate that these early clinical observations indirectly confirm the ability of PD325901 to penetrate the human brain and exert its anti Ras-ERK activity. Although the toxicity issue is of unquestionable relevance, the protocol used in clinical trials for cancer therapy consisted of repeated and intermittent oral administrations of the compound. In contrast, with our protocol we demonstrated a remarkable inhibitory effect on both CPP and SA with a single administration, suggesting that such a treatment in humans should not cause major complications. Importantly, the ability of a single dose of PD325901 to accelerate the\u00a0extinction of cocaine self-administration is obviously a key finding, which for the first time supports the idea that a systemic Ras-ERK inhibition may lead to a significant reduction in behaviours mediated by cocaine-cue associations. Obviously, it remains to be seen whether such an effect could be replicated in patients and whether a single dose/behavioural treatment would be sufficient to block relapse. One important concern related to future clinical developments is the potential side effects of PD325901 on memory mechanisms. Indeed, our own data indicate that this drug may cause memory dysfunctions both during the acquisition and the retrieval phases, but at doses that are significantly higher (25 mg/kg) than those used in cancer therapy and in our cocaine experiments. Importantly, the fact that we propose here to administer only one or a\u00a0few doses of PD325901 at 10 mg/kg to treat cocaine addiction should be reassuring since such protocols are unlikely to cause permanent memory impairments. In addition, we would like to note that in our cocaine behavioural paradigms we used a dose which is far above the minimal (2.5 mg/kg) effective one in blocking ERK phosphorylation and thus it is likely that doses lower than 10 mg/kg could still be of therapeutic value."

Furthermore, in\u00a0contrast\u00a0to PD325901, SL327 at the dose necessary to completely block ERK phosphorylation (50 mg/kg) and commonly used in several behavioural paradigms, showed significant detrimental consequences on locomotion, suggesting potential off target effects that should be further evaluated (<a href=\"#bib70\">Valjent et al., 2006b</a>).

Briefly, CPP was performed in a three-chamber apparatus containing two large compartments with distinct patterns on the floors and walls, separated by a central neutral area. During the pre-conditioning phase, mice were allowed 18 min free access to the apparatus. Only mice that spent less than 75% of their time in any one compartment were included in the study. During the conditioning phase (days 2\u20137), mice were confined to one compartment for 20 min after an injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) on days 2, 4, and 6, or to the other compartment after a saline injection on days 3, 5, and 7. Saline-treated mice received six pairings of saline. One hour prior to the conditioning test (day 8, test 1), mice were treated with vehicle or inhibitors (PD325901, 10 mg/kg, RB1/RB3 mix, 20 mg/kg or Trametinib, 10 mg/kg) and then allowed 18 min free access to the apparatus. A place preference score was calculated for each mouse as the difference between pre-conditioning and post-conditioning time spent in the drug-paired compartment. After 2 weeks (day 22, test 2), mice were retested in the CPP apparatus in a drug-free state. The day following test 2 (day 23), mice underwent one conditioning session (20 min) in the CPP apparatus immediately after cocaine or saline injection (20 mg/kg, i.p.). CPP was tested the following day (day 24, test 3)."

On day 1, mice were first allowed to habituate to the testing arena in a 5 min session. Thigmotaxis (i.e. the percentage of time spent near the walls) was measured as an index of anxiety by analysing the visual recording made with a video camera. On day 2, animals underwent the training phase (10 min), in which two identical objects were introduced into the arena before allowing the mouse to explore. The amount of time that the rodents spent exploring each object was scored. Finally, on day 3, mice were tested for their 24 hr memory (10 min). The discrimination index (DI), defined as the difference between the exploration time for the novel object and the one for the familiar object, divided by total exploration time, was calculated. The recognition index (RI) measures the ability of an animal to recognise a same object at different time points and it is based on the fact that if an animal maintains the\u00a0memory of the previously encountered familiar object, its percentage of exploration for that object will decrease when the animal is exposed to the same object for a second time. RI was computed as follows: [(percentage of exploration of the undisplaced familiar object during the training) \u2013 (percentage of exploration of the undisplaced familiar object during the test)] / percentage of exploration of the undisplaced familiar object during the training (<a href=\"#bib15\">d'Isa et al., 2014</a>)."

Operant chambers were controlled using Med-PC IV (Med Associates, USA) software. Mice were implanted with an indwelling intravenous catheter (made in-house) into the jugular vein. Catheter patency was maintained with 0.15 ml heparanised saline (100 i.u./ml) containing Baytril (0.7 mg/ml) administered daily throughout the experiment. After 3-day recovery, self-administration in mice began."

Extensive published work already indicates the critical role played by ERK in a multitude of physio-pathological processes, including learning, memory and drug addiction. One MEK inhibitor, PD325901, is already in clinical trials for cancer, thus it has potential be used as a treatment for brain disorders in humans. The idea of utilizing systemically administrable ERK inhibitors to reverse addictive-like behaviors is intriguing, and here the authors test two brain-penetrating peptides and a small molecule compound, which they show inhibit ERK signalling in the brain and reduce cocaine conditioned place preference. Most importantly they report that a single dose of PD325901 enhances extinction of drug seeking in a self-administration procedure that is highly relevant as a clinical model."
