This imbalance has created a hypercompetitive research environment that endangers the vitality of biomedical science in the US. Last year a group of four prominent scientists\u2014Bruce Alberts, Marc Kirschner, Shirley Tilghman and Harold Varmus\u2014published a set of recommendations aimed at rectifying this imbalance (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alberts et al., 2014</a>). These recommendations were subsequently vetted by a group of about 30 scientific leaders: these leaders agreed about the problems, but not the solutions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alberts et al., 2015</a>). One recommendation\u2014cutting the number of PhD students in order to ultimately decrease the number of independent researchers\u2014was especially controversial (<a href=\"#bib7\">Kelly and Marians, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Marder, 2014</a>)."

In contrast to previous efforts (<a href=\"#bib9\">McDowell et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alberts et al., 2015</a>), this workshop solicited input from all sectors of the research community. Both the leaders of the workshop and the participants came from across campus, including the School of Medicine and Public Health, the College of Letters and Sciences, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and the College of Engineering. Involvement also spanned career stages, including graduate students, postdocs, staff scientists, faculty of all ranks, and university administrators."

A public launch was led by the Chancellor of UW-Madison, Rebecca Blank, and two of the present authors (MRM and JK). Campus-wide pre-workshop discussions were then held over the course of a month, each week focusing on a different topic: the funding mechanisms used by the National Institutes of Health (NIH); numbers in the biomedical workforce; NIH peer review; and the shape of the biomedical workplace. Leadership teams spanning career stage (PhD student to Associate Dean), research approach (basic to translational), and biomedical field (social sciences to engineering) drove these pre-workshop discussions. All members of the biomedical research community were invited and two sessions were held for each topic: one at the central campus and one in the medical school. A vital feature of these pre-workshop discussions was that 30 minutes of each discussion was restricted to input from graduate students and postdocs, with the goal of ensuring frank input from trainees."

At the same time, NIH awards have shifted towards senior investigators at the expense of junior investigators, and towards risk-averse projects, often with a translational focus.

Second, in addition to offering grants to fund projects, more NIH institutes should offer grants to fund investigators, such as the new <a href=\"http://www.nigms.nih.gov/research/mechanisms/MIRA/pages/default.aspx\">MIRA</a> award being introduced at the NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences.

For example, a million dollar limit could be applied to investigators in basic biomedical research. Fourth, the NIH should increase the proportion of its budget directed to Research Project Grants, Center Grants and Training, and it should decrease the proportion directed to R&D contracts, Requests for Applications (RFAs) and intramural research. These changes would redirect funds towards investigator-initiated research and allow funding of a greater diversity of projects. R&D contracts and RFAs place limits on the topics and approaches that can be pursued, so a shift away from them will lead to fewer intellectual constraints being placed on researchers. We emphasize that this is not a recommendation to eliminate R&D contracts or RFAs, but rather to reduce their number, which will sharpen their quality and provide the funds needed to award more investigator-initiated grants. Last, the NIH should continue to set higher pay-lines for \u2018early stage\u2019 investigators and to prioritize \u2018first-time renewals\u2019 in order to promote the research of these junior investigators.

However, this recommendation received little support from the UW-Madison research community. Cutting the number of students would limit the number of trained scientists entering the workforce, which was not favored. In addition, casting a wide net was viewed as the best way to capture the most talented and diverse graduate students, as argued previously by others (<a href=\"#bib7\">Kelly and Marians, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Marder, 2014</a>). And there was little support among faculty for the proposal to shift funding for graduate students from research project grants to training grants. There were three main reasons for this: training grants only cover a portion of training costs; they fund few non-US citizens; and the relatively narrow focus of training grants would limit intellectual diversity. The prevailing view was that dramatic cuts to graduate student numbers and a shift to training grants would do more harm than good."

Most workshop participants preferred this option and supported the broadening of PhD programs to include experiences relevant to non-academic careers. In the trainee-only discussions, students reported feeling pressure from their mentors to pursue an academic career, and they argued that opportunities for experience with non-academic careers should be expanded to make them less likely to \u2018default\u2019 to an academic postdoc (see <a href=\"#box2\">Box 2</a>).

To increase transparency about the career paths open to PhDs, all NIH-funded labs and training programs should post trainee career outcomes on their websites. Grant holders should also be required to be supportive of trainees who want to pursue careers outside research. This pipeline change will not reverse the current crisis immediately but it should have a major impact within a few years. A second mechanism is for a subset of graduate students to earn a Masters of Science degree instead of a PhD. One problem with this suggestion is that a Masters degree is sometimes viewed as a consolation prize, rather than a valuable postgraduate qualification: to combat this perception, we suggest that a Masters degree should be made a mandatory step towards a PhD."

Such a shift has the dual advantage of reducing reliance on trainee labor and improving career prospects in biomedical research. But that shift comes with increased expense and a need for more stability of the staff scientist career track, a concern voiced by UW-Madison staff scientists (see <a href=\"#box3\">Box 3</a>). We suggest a few mechanisms to foster this career track. First, the NIH should provide funds to cover the extra cost of replacing a trainee position with a staff scientist; the mechanism for doing this could be similar to the <a href=\"http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/Mechanisms/Pages/PromoteDiversity.aspx\">supplements used to promote the diversity of the research workforce</a>. Second, the NIH should expand the number of <a href=\"http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/bsa/bsa0315/04-Singer.pdf\">Research Specialist Awards</a> recently introduced at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to support staff scientists. Finally, institutions should develop mechanisms to recognize staff scientists and promote their careers."

However, academic staff scientist positions often lack stability and opportunity for advancement. Accordingly, we recommend that the stability of the staff scientist position should be increased progressively with time of employment by the development of federal or institutional funding mechanisms that cover at least part of the salary of the staff scientist. We also recommend that institutional rules be modified to explicitly increase the opportunities open to staff scientists for promotion, recognition and compensation. Additionally, we recommend that staff scientists be allowed multiple roles as a means to both broaden the work experience of the scientists and to provide a potential fallback if support for research is lost: these other roles could include administration (e.g., at a core facility), teaching or outreach. Finally, we recommend that the roles and expectations of staff scientists be clearly defined."

We suggest a three-pronged approach to address these pressures and improve the current system."

These steps should include: capping the number of grant submissions per investigator per year (with exceptions for unfunded investigators); reducing the turnaround time between submission and funding to six months, so that fewer applications are submitted as \u2018back-ups\u2019; and, as mentioned above, introducing more investigator-based rather than project-based grants. More radically, we suggest that the NIH raise the pay-line to 20%, regardless of the funds available, with a sliding scale of funding that depends on the score received by the application and on the other funds available to the investigator. For example, those with higher scores might receive close to their full request, while those with lower scores might receive only half the amount requested (and be expected to achieve half of the aims listed in the application). An increased pay-line will reduce the number of applications because strong proposals will not require re-review. It will also decrease the lottery-like, all-or-nothing aspect of grant review, increase funding stability at the expense of lab size, and broaden the NIH's research portfolio. Collectively, the recommended changes will result in investigators spending less time applying for funding and more time conducting research and mentoring. They would also allow staff at the NIH Center for Scientific Review to spend less time organizing reviews and more time training reviewers."

In addition, we suggest that the NIH reduce the number of grant cycles, ideally to two per year, which should be possible with changes that result in fewer applications and a shorter turnaround time (as described above).

We envision a monthly review process in which 10 reviewers, covering broad research areas, each respond yea or nay to a proposal, with one or two explanatory sentences, and with a final vote of &gt;70% approval required for funding."

Finally, we urge that the NIH discontinue the practice of distributing funds as a percentage of the number of grants submitted in a particular area. This policy can overfund areas in which there are many proposals taking similar approaches, and where in some cases the projected outcomes are of relatively low significance, and underfund other areas in which there are fewer proposals but the projected outcomes could be more groundbreaking. Instead, the NIH should evaluate research across study sections and award funding on the basis of significance, quality and originality of the expected outcome."

Centralized, online information about core facilities on each campus will make them more accessible. To provide stability for these key resources, funding of core facilities and their staff scientists should be a joint venture between institutions and the NIH via infrastructure grants, indirect costs and other sources."

In these fields, avoiding collaboration hamstrings junior investigators. We specifically suggest that tenure-granting institutions develop explicit guidelines for evaluating collaboration (both in publications and in funding). Another barrier to collaboration is that junior investigators who join a multi-investigator grant can lose their early-stage investigator status (and the higher pay-line associated with it).

Cultural changes can and must strengthen biomedical research, but a sustained increase in federal funding is also essential as research costs continue to increase and opportunities expand.
