We quantified variation in CHC profiles in the <i>D. melanogaster</i> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and identified novel CHCs. We used principal component (PC) analysis to extract PCs that explain the majority of CHC variation and identified polymorphisms in or near 305 and 173 genes in females and males, respectively, associated with variation in these PCs. In addition, 17 DGRP lines contain the functional <i>Desat2</i> allele characteristic of African and Caribbean <i>D. melanogaster</i> females (more 5,9-C27:2 and less 7,11-C27:2, female sex pheromone isomers). Disruption of expression of 24 candidate genes affected CHC composition in at least one sex. These genes are associated with fatty acid metabolism and represent mechanistic targets for individual variation in CHC composition."

We quantified variation in CHC profiles in the <i>D. melanogaster</i> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and identified novel CHCs. We used principal component (PC) analysis to extract PCs that explain the majority of CHC variation and identified polymorphisms in or near 305 and 173 genes in females and males, respectively, associated with variation in these PCs. In addition, 17 DGRP lines contain the functional <i>Desat2</i> allele characteristic of African and Caribbean <i>D. melanogaster</i> females (more 5,9-C27:2 and less 7,11-C27:2, female sex pheromone isomers). Disruption of expression of 24 candidate genes affected CHC composition in at least one sex. These genes are associated with fatty acid metabolism and represent mechanistic targets for individual variation in CHC composition."

They evolved about 480 million years ago and their fecundity and rapid evolutionary adaptations have made them successful in populating almost every ecological niche on our planet. The evolution of mechanisms for desiccation resistance was critical for insects to colonize dry land. To prevent desiccation insects evolved the ability to produce and accumulate species-specific blends of fatty acid-derived apolar lipids on the epicuticle; the most prominent of these are cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jallon et al., 1997</a>). CHCs are produced continuously by specialized cells called oenocytes, and are transported through the hemolymph and then to the cuticular surface through specialized pore canals (<a href=\"#bib49\">Romer, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schal et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blomquist and Bagn\u00e8res, 2010</a>). The primary role of CHCs is desiccation resistance (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gibbs, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">2002</a>), but they have been co-opted to serve as chemical signals and cues mediating intra- and inter-specific social interactions (<a href=\"#bib58\">Venard and Jallon, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jallon, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ferveur, 2005</a>). These interactions include species and nest-mate recognition, assessment of reproductive status, and mate choice, and CHCs play a prominent role in camouflage and mimicry that mediate inter-specific parasitic relationships (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stanley-Samuelson and Nelson, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blomquist and Bagn\u00e8res, 2010</a>)."

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) then catalyzes the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, and the multifunctional protein fatty acid synthase (FASN) successively incorporates malonyl-CoA units onto the acetyl-CoA, elongating the chain by two carbons each time and forming long chain fatty acids (LCFA). RNAi-knockdown of <i>ACC</i> in the oenocytes completely eliminates CHCs in both male and female <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</a>). Products of insect FASN, including <i>Drosophila</i> FASN, can be 14, 16 or 18 carbon fatty acids. A thioesterase that is part of the multienzyme FASN removes the elongated chain as a free fatty acid, and fatty acid elongation and desaturation use the CoA derivative and take place in the microsomal fraction (endoplasmic reticulum). Members of a family of tissue-specific elongases (ELOVL) catalyze the incorporation of malonyl-CoA units to form very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA). After condensation of the malonyl-CoA with the fatty acyl-CoA the next three steps in each elongation cycle include reduction of a carbonyl to an alcohol (by a 3-keto-acyl-CoA-reductase; KAR), dehydration (by a 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA-dehydratase; HADC), and reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond by a trans-enoyl-CoA-reductase (TER). The VLCA as the CoA derivative is readuced to an aldehyde by a fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR). The one-carbon chain-shortening conversion of aldehydes to hydrocarbons is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme, Cyp4G1 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Qiu et al., 2012</a>). Desaturation reactions to introduce double bonds, leading to unsaturated fatty acids, appear to occur on the 16 or 18 carbon fatty acyl-CoAs."

QTL mapping analyses have also identified genomic regions called <i>small monoene quantities (smoq</i>) and <i>seven pentacosene (sept</i>), respectively, associated with variation in the proportions of 7-C23:1 and 7-C25:1 in males (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ferveur and Jallon, 1996</a>).

We found considerable heritable genetic variation in a majority of male and female CHCs, distilled the axes of genetic variation into several principal components (PCs), and performed GWA analyses on each PC. We identified 24 candidate genes plausibly associated with CHC biosynthesis and for all of them disruption of their expression altered CHC profiles in males, females, or both sexes. Surprisingly, we also found that the DGRP lines are segregating for the ancestral and deletion alleles in <i>Desat2,</i> previously associated with CHC profiles thought to be unique for African flies. Finally, our results provide a new perspective and highlight the complexity of the biosynthetic and catabolic pathways that regulate the dynamics of CHC composition and provide the stage for adaptive evolution. In agreement with other recent studies of complex traits, our results demonstrate that the genetic architecture underlying potentially adaptive traits can consist of many, even hundreds, of polymorphic loci with small effects affecting different aspects of the phenotype."

It consists of two desaturase genes, <i>Desat1</i> and <i>Desat2. Desat1</i> is expressed in both sexes and encodes a \u0394-9 desaturase that catalyzes the synthesis of palmitoleic acid, an \u03c9-7 fatty acid and precursor to 7-monoene and the first double bond of 7,11-dienes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Labeur et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Marcillac et al., 2005</a>). <i>Desat2</i> has a female-specific effect on CHC production and has been associated with adaptive divergence of African and Cosmopolitan races of <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Greenberg et al., 2003</a>, but see <a href=\"#bib15\">Coyne and Elwyn, 2006</a>). <i>Desat2</i> encodes a functional desaturase in African females, but is inactive in Cosmopolitan females due to a 16-bp deletion in the promoter region (<a href=\"#bib14\">Coyne et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dallerac et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">Takahashi et al., 2001</a>).

It is possible that the lines with homozygous standard karyotypes are actually segregating for the inversion at low frequency and thus only the homozygous standard flies were sampled for karyotyping. Alternatively, the <i>Desat2</i> deletion may have occurred prior to the inversion event."

Genes tagged by variants associated with PC2 include <i>approximated</i> (<i>app</i>), a palmitoyltransferase; <i>PHGPx</i>, a peroxidase; and <i>CG16979</i>, a thiolester hydrolase. Top variants in the PC3 GWA analysis included two genes predicted to be fatty acid elongases (<i>CG18609, CG30008</i>) and an NADH dehydrogenase (<i>CG8680</i>). The most significant variant in the PC5 GWA analysis was a nonsynonymous SNP (<i>3R</i>_8220563_SNP, <i>P</i> = 1.97E-09) in <i>CG10097</i>, which also encodes a fatty acyl-CoA reductase. Interestingly, there are two cytochrome P450 genes located upstream of <i>CG10097</i>, one functional (<i>Cyp9f2</i>) and one pseudogenized (<i>Cyp9f3Psi</i>)."

While it is possible that the elongated fatty acyl-CoA is reduced from acyl-CoA to aldehyde to alcohol and then reoxidized to aldehyde before oxidative decarbonylation, to date there is no evidence for this. <i>CG13091</i> and <i>CG10097</i> encode fatty acyl-CoA reductases, which are both expressed at high levels in males and at low levels in females.

Males also had increased total CHCs and large increases in shorter-chain CHCs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This effect was mimicked by interference with expression of <i>Cyp9f2</i>, which also resulted in fewer longer-chain monoenes, alkanes, and many methyl-branched CHCs. However, as for <i>CG18609</i>, 2-Me-C24 increased in females and other shorter-chain methyl-branched CHCs were trending upward. In males, there were overall increases, but especially in the shorter-chain CHCs. These observations suggest that <i>CG18609</i> may function in the biosynthesis of CHCs in coordination with <i>Cyp9f2</i>. Interestingly, the <i>CG9458</i> knockdown had sexually dimorphic effects on CHC production, increasing male CHCs and decreasing nearly all <i>n</i>-alkanes and monoenes in females.

The increase in CHCs in males with compromised <i>Cyp49a1</i> function was accompanied by a decrease in many female CHCs. Reduced expression of <i>Cyp4s3</i> resulted in increased CHC abundance in both sexes. The link between these CYPs and CHC production and maintenance is unclear.

However, interference with their expression through targeted RNAi resulted in different shifts in CHC composition. Disruption of <i>Irc</i> reduced the amounts of monoenes and increased the amounts of dienes in females, while increasing male CHCs, reminiscent of the effects of disruption of <i>Cyp49a1</i>. The effects of interference with <i>Pxd</i> were more complex. In females, nearly all CHCs increased, while in males many odd-chain CHCs increased, but there were decreases only in even-chain CHCs. A similar phenomenon was observed with disruption of <i>Cyp4s3.

Using the DGRP, we report one of the most comprehensive characterizations of natural variation in insect CHCs to date. We provide unambiguous evidence for extensive heritable individual variation in the relative abundances of CHC components. MMC analysis shows that CHC components are not independent, but can be organized as correlated modules, which likely reflect common biosynthetic origins. Variation in the CHC profiles can be captured with a limited number of PCs, which were used as composite phenotypic values for GWA analyses. This resulted in the identification of candidate genes associated with variation in CHC composition in males and females, including several genes which could be plausibly associated with CHC biosynthesis. Despite a lenient significance threshold for reporting associations, targeted gene disruption of each of these 24 candidate genes indeed affected CHC composition, often in a sexually dimorphic manner. Our results highlight the complex interactions among genes that directly affect the composition and accumulation of CHCs and regulatory elements that affect CHC indirectly through general lipid metabolism and nutrition (see also <a href=\"#bib61\">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</a>)."

Surprisingly, we found that the DGRP is segregating for the African CHC phenotype.

On average, females of DGRP lines that were heterozygous or homozygous for the functional allele, regardless of inversion status, had intermediate amounts of the sex pheromone CHC peaks relative to the African lines or DGRP lines with the deletion. However, one DGRP line, DGRP_367, had more 5,9-C27:2 than either African line. Two DGRP lines (DGRP_105, ins/ins, INV/ INV and DGRP_551, ins/del, ST/ ST) had the functional <i>Desat2</i> allele, yet exhibited the Cosmopolitan phenotype. These results are in contrast to previous reports of complete association of the ancestral allele with the African female CHC phenotype (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dallerac et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Takahashi et al., 2001</a>). Further analyses showed that other <i>Desat2</i> polymorphisms in DGRP_105 likely result in a non-functional protein. However, the other Cosmopolitan-like line, DGRP_551, is puzzling because it is heterozygous for the functional allele, but homozygous for the standard karyotype. It is possible that this line is segregating for the <i>In(3R)K</i> inversion at low frequency and individuals with the ST/INV karyotype were not detected, but the lack of correspondence between the functional allele and CHC status remains unexplained since <i>Desat2</i> itself does not harbor a potentially damaging mutation in this line. Perhaps a polymorphism in an unknown gene in DGRP_551 interacts with the <i>Desat2</i> functional allele to suppress its effects. Finally, there were four DGRP lines that exhibited the African phenotype and were homozygous for the ancestral allele, but they were ST/ST in karyotype. One possible explanation for this 'mismatching' of phenotype and genotype with the karyotype is that the <i>Desat2</i> 16-bp deletion occurred prior to the inversion event. This would mean that the inversion may be segregating for the <i>Desat2</i> 16-bp allele."

However, we did find many novel candidate genes, and functional tests showed that disruption of expression of all tested candidate genes had significant effects on the amount of CHC on the cuticular surface. While the mechanistic relationships between any of these genes are unknown, some share commonalities in their phenotypes when their expression is disrupted with RNAi. However, the majority of genes which encode gene products with similar molecular functions result in different shifts in CHC profiles when disrupted. Thus, variation in the CHC profile arises as an emergent phenotype from the dynamics of complex interrelated biosynthetic and catabolic pathways."

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that differential effectiveness of RNAi in males and females may contribute to apparent sexual dimorphism. In addition, we note that phenotypic changes associated with knocking down expression of a target gene with RNAi may not be causal, but a consequence of off-target effects of RNAi or the <i>GAL4</i> driver. Further studies are needed to clarify the effects on CHC production of these genes and their interactions, and to test specific mechanisms and enzymatic activities through which they exert these effects. Furthermore, it is important to note that the RNAi and mutant experiments test for effects at the level of genes and are only proxies for the effects of segregating natural variants in these genes."

We also calculated the mean total amount of CHCs (ng/fly); we used the more conservative Cochran and Cox test, which assumes unequal group variances to assess statistically significant effects on CHC composition. We also present these data as \u00b5g/fly in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig7s24\">24</a>. <i>t-</i>tests were conducted in SAS v. 9.4 (2013 SAS Institute Inc.)."

This is true in the glucosinolate work within <i>Arabidopsis</i> wherein the PC approach utilized by Bergelson and colleagues was unable to identify all of the key biosynthetic enzymes that could be identified on a more metabolite by specific metabolite analysis or alternatively using ratios of precursors to products (Wentzell et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2011; Brachi et al., 2015).

It is not typically called an acyl carrier protein complex. Products of insect FASs, particularly <i>Drosophila</i> FAS, can be 14, 16 or 18 carbons. A thioesterase that is part of the multienzyme FAS removes the elongated chain as a free fatty acid. I do not know what is meant by conjugating and the acyl group is never removed by a thioreductase.

The authors stated that they were able to identify these compounds because they use a thin high res column (DB-5) and a relatively long temperature program. I am concerned about the use of this column for the separation of <i>D. melanogaster</i> CHCs as this column cannot separate two major compounds in female <i>Drosophila</i>. Peak 46 contains both 2Me-C26 and 7,11-C27:2. This is a concern for the second part of the paper (the <i>Desat2</i> allele and female CHC phenotyping) because 2Me-C26 is a major compound. If they cannot separate these two compounds, then it would be impossible to quantify accurately the amount of 7,11-C27:2 in the fly. Another recent paper (Dweck et al., 2015, PNAS) also used a different method to identify CHC in <i>D. melanogaster</i>. While they identified some methyl-branched CHCs which are not 2-methyl-branched, they did not identify the dienes with the even double bonds presented in this study. The authors stated that these compounds are identified based on comparison to the reference library and to already published <i>D. melanogaster</i> CHCs and the position of the double bond was not confirmed for any of the CHCs. While most of these compounds exist in low quantities, I suggest the authors proceed with caution on claiming that they have identified new (and unusual) compounds that many other groups using different methods over the years have not been able to identify."

In this section, using GWA, the authors identified genetic variants in hundreds of genes which could potentially affect CHC composition. The authors selected 24 candidate genes for functional studies. They used an oenocyte specific driver (although this driver also expresses GAL4 in some other tissues) to knockdown candidate genes in the oenocytes, where CHCs are synthesized. This is a very comprehensive section that entails a tremendous amount of work in both genomic analysis and functional characterization. The authors found that oenocyte-driven RNAi knockdown of 23 candidate genes individually showed quantitative changes in CHC profiles.

The next three steps are a reduction of a carbonyl to an alcohol, dehydration, and reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond. The authors are making too extensive use of plant lipid metabolism data. The FAS in animals, including flies, occurs on the multifunctional protein fatty acid synthetase (FAS) in which the growing chain is attached to an acyl carrier type unit that is part of the multifunctional (7 enzyme activities on one protein, act in a dimer). It is not typically called an acyl carrier protein complex. Products of insect FASs, particularly</i> Drosophila <i>FAS, can be 14, 16 or 18 carbons.

So, when the diene is absent the alkane can be readily separated and vice versa. However, when the diene is a major component (e.g., 7,11-C27:2 in females, where it serves as a sex pheromone component), the alkane represents a tiny shoulder preceding the diene and they cannot be reliably separated. See our <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>: Peak 57 in males is 2Me-C26 and it elutes just slightly ahead of peak 57 in females, which is mainly 7,11-C27:2. Therefore, this peak can be highly variable depending whether it is in males or females. In order to treat this variable peak consistently in all chromatograms, we considered these 2 compounds together as a single peak for integration, with the recognition that it represents almost exclusively the diene in females and the alkane in males. The paper referenced by the reviewer (Dweck et al. 2015 PNAS) in fact did not separate 2Me-C26 and 7,11-C27:2 (their peaks #74 and 75 in Table Supplement 1 and Figure Supplement 1). While the table shows them separated by 3 Kovats units, the figure shows them co-eluting in females because of the large amount of #75. Only when males are examined can #74 be separated because males lack #75 (7,11-C27:2). The same is true for shorter chain compounds. In fact, Dweck et al. (2015 PNAS) confirm our findings that the 2-methyl-branched compounds are found in males (their peaks #59, 68) and either not found at all in females or in very small amounts. So, our Peak 46 contains both 2Me-C26 and 7,11-C27:2 (as in Dweck et al. 2015 PNAS peaks 74 and 75), but the alkane represents a tiny fraction of the diene that serves as sex pheromone. Dweck et al. (2015 PNAS) used a HP5 column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 \u00b5m) and ran &gt;45 min chromatograms and could not separate these compounds in females. We ran an identical GC phase (DB-5) but in a column (20 m, 0.18 mm, 0.18 \u00b5m) that allowed high resolution in much shorter run times of 32 min to optimize the analysis of thousands (hundreds?) of chromatograms. Others (e.g., Frentiu et al. 2010 Evolution) also show no evidence of separating these compounds in females."
