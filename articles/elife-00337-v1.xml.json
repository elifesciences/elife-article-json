We show that during the development of the <i>Drosophila</i> central nervous system, mutual inhibition among groups of neighboring postmitotic neurons during development regulates the robustness of axon target choice in a nondeterministic neuronal circuit. Specifically, neighboring postmitotic neurons communicate through Notch signaling during axonal targeting, to ensure balanced alternative axon target choices without a corresponding change in cell fate. Loss of Notch in postmitotic neurons modulates an axon's target choice. However, because neighboring axons respond by choosing the complementary target, the stereotyped connectivity pattern is preserved. In contrast, loss of Notch in clones of neighboring postmitotic neurons results in erroneous coinnervation by multiple axons. Our observations establish mutual inhibition of axonal target choice as a robustness mechanism for brain wiring and unveil a novel cell fate independent function for canonical Notch signaling."

We show that during the development of the <i>Drosophila</i> central nervous system, mutual inhibition among groups of neighboring postmitotic neurons during development regulates the robustness of axon target choice in a nondeterministic neuronal circuit. Specifically, neighboring postmitotic neurons communicate through Notch signaling during axonal targeting, to ensure balanced alternative axon target choices without a corresponding change in cell fate. Loss of Notch in postmitotic neurons modulates an axon's target choice. However, because neighboring axons respond by choosing the complementary target, the stereotyped connectivity pattern is preserved. In contrast, loss of Notch in clones of neighboring postmitotic neurons results in erroneous coinnervation by multiple axons. Our observations establish mutual inhibition of axonal target choice as a robustness mechanism for brain wiring and unveil a novel cell fate independent function for canonical Notch signaling."

However, it has the evolutionary disadvantage of limiting individual variability, and thus efficient adaptation to environmental change. Furthermore, a strictly deterministic coupling has the significant developmental disadvantage of limiting cellular plasticity in response to inevitable genetic and epigenetic variability within the developing brain (<a href=\"#bib23\">Muotri et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">2010</a>). The latter point is particularly critical in neuronal lineages that are intrinsically variable in cell number."

                        "text": "Notch signaling is a highly conserved crucial regulator of early nervous system development. The most well-established function for Notch signaling in neural development is the selection of neural progenitor cells through a process termed mutual or lateral inhibition (<a href=\"#bib1\">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</a>). In lateral inhibition, a group of equivalent neuroepithelial cells that initially express roughly the same Notch activity are eventually segregated in two groups defined by expression and activity levels of the receptor Notch and its membrane-bound ligand Delta. Due to cell\u2013cell communication among overlapping clusters of adjacent cells, small differences in Notch expression level are amplified. As a consequence, the majority of cells within these clusters express high Notch activity levels, whereas a minority of cells express low Notch activity. These cells then go on to differentiate as neuronal progenitors. A second important function for Notch signaling is the establishment of alternate binary cell fates of sibling neurons. In contrast to lateral inhibition, this function requires the asymmetric inheritance of the Notch antagonist Numb by one of the two sibling neurons in a terminal cell division (<a href=\"#bib13\">Guo et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Spana and Doe, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Knoblich, 1997</a>). It has been proposed that early binary cell fate specification via Notch-Delta signaling results in alternative axon targeting. In the fly visual system, the R7 and R8 photoreceptors, which independently require Notch activity to be specified, make alternative axonal target choices that appear to be consequences of their different fates. Indeed, their canonical fate marker transcription factors Prospero and Senseless, respectively, are required for this differential targeting (<a href=\"#bib22\">Morey et al., 2008</a>). In the olfactory system of <i>Drosophila</i>, sibling neurons target their axon to different central nervous system (CNS) glomeruli due to differential cell fate specification (<a href=\"#bib11\">Endo et al., 2007</a>). A recent elegant extension of this work shows that chromatin modification of Notch targets by the Hamlet protein further diversifies cell fate and axonal targeting in olfactory neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Endo et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, in this work, the effects were not restricted to sibling neurons, but extended to neighboring non-sibling neurons, and the corresponding effects on axonal targeting were not strictly binary nor fully penetrant leading to speculation that Notch activity might have probabilistic effects on axonal targeting downstream of cell fate specification (<a href=\"#bib28\">Schmucker and Hassan, 2012</a>). Finally, an extensive analysis of CNS neurons in the fly olfactory circuit shows that there are more diverse wiring morphologies than can be accounted for by the number of cell types (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chou et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that post-fate mechanisms may be crucial in wiring the <i>Drosophila</i> CNS. What these post-fate mechanisms are, and how they buffer intrinsic variability to generate stereotyped wiring patterns, is unknown."

We combine high resolution quantitative anatomical analyses, computational modeling, and genetic dissection to show that Notch-mediated mutual inhibition acts late in development on postmitotic neurons to bias axonal target choice. Finally, we show that this mechanism ensures the reproducibility of the DCN connectivity pattern."

All postmitotic DCNs are efficiently labeled with the <i>ato-Gal4</i> driver starting at the third instar larval (L3) stage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). DCNs innervate two regions of the optic lobes, the lobula and the medulla. This binary axon target choice is a result of three distinct steps (<a href=\"#bib30\">Srahna et al., 2006</a>). First, in late third instar larvae DCN axons grow en masse toward the developing medulla neuropil attracted by a Wnt5 signal. Second, at 25\u201350 hr after puparium formation (APF), most DCN axons begin to retract back to the lobula neuropil, likely in response to a repulsive fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2032\u2013A\u2033</a> ). Wnt and FGF have opposing effects on Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) activity, which is both necessary and sufficient for DCN axon growth. Third, a small subset of regularly spaced axons resist the repulsive signal, by an unknown mechanism, and remain in the medulla (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2032\u2032\u2032</a> ). These observations hint that the pattern of DCN axons may arise by a sorting mechanism that generates two mutually exclusive DCN axon target choices: lobula vs medulla (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2033</a>)."

Briefly, DCNs were labeled with GFP, driven by <i>ato-Gal4</i>, and imaged. Each DCN soma and axon were assigned 3D coordinates and analyzed with the \u2018clusterdata' function in MATLAB (see the \u2018Materials and methods' section for imaging and DCN profile details). These analyses reveal a number of interesting features. First, all DCNs express the same cell fate markers, Atonal and Acj6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B\u2032</a>), as detected by antibody staining, already at L3 prior to initiating axon outgrowth towards the optic lobes. Second, although there are on average 38 DCNs producing a highly stereotyped pattern of 12 spaced axons in the medulla (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), the DCN lineage itself is not fixed. The number of neurons varies (35\u201343 neurons) not only between different individuals but also between the right and left sides of the same individual (r = \u22120.148; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Furthermore, there is no correlation between the number of neurons in a cluster and the number of medulla axons it projects (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, top graph). Thus, the DCNs represent an intrinsically variable lineage of similar neurons."

DCNs are born in a ventral to dorsal order (<a href=\"#bib33\">Zheng et al., 2006</a>), and each DCN establishes one ipsilateral dendritic arbor and one contralateral axonal arbor (<a href=\"#bib30\">Srahna et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Nicolai et al., 2010</a>). Using the flip-out technique (<a href=\"#bib31\">Wong et al., 2002</a>), we labeled single DCNs with membrane-bound GFP and visualized them in the background of the entire cluster labeled with LacZ. We found that medulla targeting neurons are located all along the dorsal\u2013ventral (D-V) and proximal\u2013distal axes of the cluster (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013G</a>). Thus, there is no correlation between birth order and medulla vs lobula targeting, confirming earlier observations that sibling DCN clones generated using the MARCM technique can target the medulla, the lobula, or one each (<a href=\"#bib33\">Zheng et al., 2006</a>). Interestingly, however, the D-V position of an axon is directly and very highly correlated (r = 0.964) with the D-V position of its soma within the cluster (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, bottom graph) such that the most dorsal neuron gives rise to the most dorsal axon and so on (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Because most DCNs at any given D-V position innervate the lobula and a few innervate the medulla, D-V positional information does not directly instruct lobula vs medulla target choice."

To this end, DCN soma were labeled with LacZ and their axons with CD8-GFP. Next, each neuron and each medulla axon were assigned their three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian coordinates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) to determine the distances between DCN cell bodies, and between each two adjacent medulla axons (see \u2018Materials and methods'). These analyses reveal two features. First, DCN soma show a few sparse cells at the dorsal and ventral extremities and a majority of cells densely packed medially (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Second, DCN medulla axons are more dense dorsally and ventrally, but more sparse medially (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Therefore, there is an inverse correlation between cell density and interaxonal distance along the D-V axis in the medulla: four to eight medial DCN soma provide one medulla axon, whereas only one to two DCN soma target one axon to the medulla dorsally and ventrally (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). It is crucial to note that this inverse relationship between soma density and medulla axon density is conserved in response to changes in cluster shape (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), yet the overall wiring pattern is preserved, strongly suggesting that DCNs use a dedicated mechanism to ensure the accuracy of the stereotyped medulla innervation pattern."

One hypothesis to explain these observations stipulates the following: DCNs operate as several small overlapping subclusters in which all neurons within a certain distance of each other compete to provide one medulla axon (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). In this model, neurons with fewer neighbors, as often seen dorsally and especially ventrally, target the medulla with higher probability.

Notch-mediated mutual inhibition gives rise to a few regularly spaced single neural progenitors while the majority of cells adopt the alternative epidermal fate (<a href=\"#bib4\">Campos-Ortega and Jan, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</a>). Indeed, DCNs express Notch and its ligand Delta during the time when DCN axon sorting is occurring (\u223c32 hr APF; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013A\u2034</a>). At this stage, all DCNs also express the Delta regulator Neuralized (Neur) and the canonical Notch pathway transcriptional reporter E(spl)-CD2 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bailey and Posakony, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lecourtois and Schweisguth, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Lai et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Pitsouli and Delidakis, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a>). Strikingly, using anti-CD2 antibodies, we find differences in the levels of the Notch activity reporter among individual DCNs: most cells express relatively high levels of E(spl)-CD2, whereas a minority of cells scattered across the D-V axis of the cluster express relatively low levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F\u2032</a>). In contrast, E(spl)-CD2 levels are very low in DCNs at L3 (data not shown) suggesting that Notch signaling is not active in postmitotic DCNs prior to pupariation. Finally, we do not detect expression of the asymmetric inherited Notch inhibitor Numb in the DCNs nor a phenotype with <i>numb</i> RNAi expression (data not shown), suggesting that differences in Notch activity between DCNs are unlikely to arise by differential inheritance, a cell fate determinant. Together these data show that Notch signaling is active within the DCNs at the time of axon target sorting."

The model predicts medulla targeting by a similar number and pattern of DCN axons as observed in vivo (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> red cells, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Next, as no previous modeling of Notch has been performed under loss of function conditions, we tested reduced Notch activity in silico. In this case, the model predicts that the stereotyped number and pattern of DCN medulla axons are disrupted. Specifically, the medulla is targeted by an increased number of axons (17.29 \u00b1 3.96) arising from several small clusters (2\u20133) of neighboring neurons, especially medially (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, red cells and blue arrows, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

                                "text": "To test these predictions, we asked whether Notch signaling is required within the DCNs. We used the ato-Gal4 driver to inhibit Notch and Delta specifically in postmitotic DCNs during adult brain development. It is critical to note that during adult brain development, ato-Gal4 is only active in DCNs postmitotically and after their axons begin to grow (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hassan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Srahna et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Zheng et al., 2006</a>). Postmitotic, DCN-specific inhibition of Notch or its ligands Delta and Serrate (Ser) leads to two phenotypes. First, we observe clustered axons at several D-V positions, particularly medially, as opposed to isolated single axons seen under control conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013F\u2032,l</a>) causing a significant decrease in axon\u2013axon distances in the medulla (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>). Second, we observe a significant increase in the number of axons targeting the medulla (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), indicating that axon clustering is the result of neighboring axons erroneously making similar target choices. These data quantitatively mirror the phenotypes predicted by computational modeling of mutual inhibition among DCNs. Importantly, loss of Notch function alters neither the number (38.13 \u00b1 2 SD vs 37.12 \u00b1 3.1 SD, <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) nor the expression of DCN fate markers (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). RNAi knockdown of Neur, a positive regulator of Delta and Ser activity, causes clustered axons and a significant increase of medulla axons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,L</a>). Finally, postmitotic and DCN-specific RNAi knockdown of the canonical Notch pathway nuclear effector proteins Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) and Mastermind (Mam) also result in axon clustering and a corresponding increase in medulla axon number (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H\u2013J\u2032,M</a>). Altogether, these data support the notion that DCNs require Notch-mediated mutual inhibitory interactions to make accurate medulla vs lobula axon target choices."

                                "text": "Previous work has shown that high JNK activity is required for DCN axons to resist retraction and innervate the medulla. We hypothesized that N and JNK might interact negatively in neurons as described in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos and mammalian cell culture (<a href=\"#bib32\">Zecchini et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">MacKenzie et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Mateos et al., 2007</a>). Furthermore, it has been proposed that downregulation of the axon guidance molecule p21 activated kinease1 (Pak1) via canonical N signaling attenuates JNK activity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mateos et al., 2007</a>), making <i>Drosophila</i> Pak an attractive target candidate in our system. Indeed, we find that gain of Pak function, by expression of the constitutively active Pak using <i>ato-Gal4</i>, phenocopies Notch inhibition resulting in a significant increase and clustering of medulla axons, while knockdown of Pak levels reduces the number of medulla innervations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>). Next, we examined the DCN medulla targeting pattern under conditions of inhibition of both N and JNK, which have opposite effects on medulla targeting. Simultaneous downregulation of JNK and N activities, using dominant negative transgenes driven by <i>ato-Gal4</i>, results in a phenotype similar to JNK inhibition alone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This supports the notion that N activity antagonizes JNK signaling. Simultaneous reduction of both Notch activity and Pak levels, using Pak RNAi, results in a phenotype indistinguishable from Pak reduction alone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), supporting the notion that Pak acts downstream of Notch. Finally, DCN-specific gain of Pak and loss of JNK activity shows a reduced number of medulla axons, resembling loss of JNK (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). These data support a model whereby N reduces JNK activity via inhibition of Pak function (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). To test this model further, we asked if gain of Notch function affects JNK activity and Pak expression levels. To this end, we expressed the constitutively active intracellular domain of Notch (NICD) in DCNs and examined the levels of JNK reporter construct <i>puckered-LacZ</i> (<i>puc-LacZ</i>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Reed et al., 2001</a>). We found a significant reduction of <i>puc-LacZ</i> levels in response to Notch activation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Next, we transfected the <i>Drosophila</i> neuronal cell line DmBG2-c3 with NICD and assayed the effects on Pak and phospho-JNK (active JNK) levels. This resulted in a significant decrease in both Pak and pJNK levels, consistent with our in vivo observations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Together, these data suggest that Notch activity sets the baseline JNK activity threshold which distinguishes medulla-targeting from lobula-targeting neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>)."

To determine more precisely the timing of Notch requirement, we took advantage of the dominant nature of loss of Notch function and a temperature sensitive Notch mutant allele (Notch<sup>ts</sup>). Flies were raised at either the permissive (18\u00b0C) or restrictive temperature (28\u00b0C) between 0 and 96 hr APF (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Reduction of Notch activity at the restrictive temperature results in clusters of neighboring axons in the medulla and a significant increase in the number of medulla axons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013E</a>). Next, we raised flies at the permissive temperature and shifted them to the restrictive temperature for 24 hr intervals at different APF stages (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Decreasing Notch activity only alters axon target choice between 24 and 60 hr APF, but neither before nor after (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,E</a>). Importantly, inhibition of Notch function specifically within the DCNs only during pupal development, using a combination of ato-Gal4 and a temperature-sensitive Gal80 (<a href=\"#bib21\">McGuire et al., 2003</a>), results in a very similar phenotype (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2032</a>). Finally, gain of Notch function via DCN-specific expression of NICD or Su(H) strongly reduces the number of medulla axons found in the adult brain, but, importantly, does not inhibit their initial outgrowth into the medulla (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F\u2013J</a>), confirming that canonical Notch signaling specifically regulates the ability of axons to remain in the medulla after initial targeting. Altogether, these data mean that Notch signaling is required within the DCNs specifically to segregate axon target choice at pupal stage between 24 and 60 hr APF, but neither before nor after."

We found that whereas only 24% of the control clones target the medulla, approximately 60% of all Notch mutant clones\u2014both null and DN\u2014do so, with the most pronounced effect occurring medially (p&lt;0.001 null, p&lt;0.001 DN, Fisher's exact test) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013D</a>). In contrast, as expected, medial Delta mutant clones favor targeting the lobula (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2032</a>) with little or no effect on dorsal or ventral clones (data not shown).

To this end, we generated flies in which Notch activity can be stochastically manipulated in sets of \u2018green' (GFP-positive) postmitotic DCNs, while their \u2018red' (Cherry-positive) neighbors remain wild type (see \u2018Materials and methods' for genotype details) in order to inhibit Notch function during axonal targeting in potentially interacting DCN subclusters. As controls, subsets of adjacent wild-type DCNs were labeled with GFP without inhibition of Notch activity. Of 20 control clones, 18 (90%) gave rise to normal medulla innervation patterns (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H\u2013H\u2033</a>) with no effect on the number of medulla axons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8J</a>). In two clones (10%), we observed one example of two adject axons each. In contrast, when Notch is stochastically inactivated in subsets of postmitotic DCNs, two types of phenotypes are observed. First, in 55% of all clones (24/44), the overall pattern remains normal, even though the mutant axons themselves target the medulla. Second, in 45% of the clones (20/44), in addition to mutant axons targeting the medulla (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I\u2032</a>, white arrows), axon clustering is observed (p=0.0094 Fisher's exact test). Furthermore, the number of medulla axons is significantly increased, and the axon\u2013axon distances within these clones is drastically reduced (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I\u2013K</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that in these cases interacting neurons of one subcluster have been targeted by the stochastic inhibition of Notch. These data validate the third prediction and strongly support the idea of Notch-mediated interactions among neighboring cells."

                        "text": "Previously, two deterministic models have been proposed to explain the requirement for Notch signaling in brain connectivity. First, binary sibling neuron fate specification by Notch\u2014as opposed to mutual inhibition\u2014has been proposed as a mechanism of fate-dependent targeting of sensory axons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Endo et al., 2007</a>). Notch has also been suggested to act as an axon guidance molecule via a noncanonical pathway in fly embryos (<a href=\"#bib10\">Crowner et al., 2003</a>). We show that higher order CNS neurons utilize mutual inhibition via Notch signaling to establish a robust wiring map. However, in contrast to the classical process of mutual inhibition, which specifies early progenitor cell fate, we demonstrate that mutual inhibition is reused in postmitotic DCN neurons. Three arguments support this interpretation. First, the decision to target the medulla neuropil of single cell Notch null mutant clone is probabilistic (\u223c60%) rather than absolute (100%) as would be expected for cell fate specification. Second, the requirement for Notch signaling in establishing the wiring diagram is restricted to 24\u201360 hr APF, and third, Notch signaling affects neither the lineage size nor the expression of different cell fate markers in the DCNs early in development. It should be noted that medulla vs lobula axon target choice can be viewed as a form of sub-fate choice. The important discovery here is that this \u2018sub-fate' is not a cell-autonomous translation of birth order instructions, but is rather subject to regulation by the choices of neighboring cells. In that sense, it extends the timing and plasticity of the phase during which neurons can be said to acquire their \u2018fate'."

                        "text": "Here, we report lateral inhibition as a novel mechanism for brain wiring. It is likely that the inhibitory interactions are taking place between the neuronal cell bodies, especially given the requirement for the nuclear factors Su(H) and Mam and the effects on the E(spl) transcriptional reporter. However, interactions between axons prior to or shortly after their defasciculation within the medulla cannot be formally ruled out. Axonal target choice resulting from mutual inhibition by neighboring postmitotic neurons is interesting, not only as a novel function for Notch signaling but also as an additional layer of regulation that complements, but is independent of, traditional axon guidance cues. While it may be sensible for sensory neurons to couple fate to targeting so that the same sensory information is carried by the same type of neuron in different animals, it is reasonable to speculate that a degree of circuit-level plasticity is a more useful strategy in higher order brain centers, where meaningful information is likely to be encoded at the network level and not by single cells. It would be interesting to test if other patterns of alternative target choices by similar neurons, such as retinal projections into the midbrain (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brown et al., 2000</a>), mammalian ocular dominance columns (<a href=\"#bib9\">Crowley and Katz, 2002</a>), or the wiring variability of <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory interneurons (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chou et al., 2010</a>) utilize similar mechanisms. Finally, given the inevitable and significant genetic and environmental variability in the real world, it seems rather intuitive that a mechanism that ensures the reproducibility of the connectivity pattern of an entire circuit, would be evolutionarily favored over a mechanisms that would risk the population connectivity pattern in favor of attempting to generate the same connectivity of precisely the same cell."

Images such as single or merged figures were created using Photoshop. For ease of viewing, images were rotated so that the DCN cluster is located on the top left corner of every image. To analyze the expression pattern of the E(spl)-CD2 carefully within the DCNs, DCN soma were isolated from the background using ImageJ. Confocal sections revealing individual DCN soma were obtained and CD2 fluorescence intensity within the different DCNs was analyzed."

The 3D coordinates were eventually normalized according to cluster diameter or lobula length and saved as <i>DCN profiles</i>. While analyzing the confocal sections, the number of neurons and medulla innervations were counted as they are a result of the number of coordinates. To calculate neuron to medulla axon ratio, the medulla axon profile was divided into 10 regions with the \u2018clusterdata' function in MATLAB. The size of each of the 10 units depends on the axonal pattern as determined by the cluster algorithm. The same division is then projected onto the soma cluster that generated the particular axonal pattern, to obtain 10 identical DCN soma divisions."

This is surprising as this Notch pathway acts as a lateral inhibitor only in the early steps of neurogenesis during embryogenesis, while we are dealing here with post-embryonic neurogenesis. One would have therefore expected a mode of lateral interactions mediated by asymmetric division of cells and asymmetric distribution of Numb, as in bristle precursor cells. The authors therefore show that, from each of the clusters of DCNs, only a fixed number of neurons, inversely proportional to the size of the cluster, choose to target the medulla rather than the lobula. Therefore, we are dealing with an embryonic type of Notch function rather then a post-embryonic mode."

In terms of the profiling likely to show intrinsic differences between medulla and lobula targeting neurons, this is highly likely to be the case. However, what is important is to ask whether such differences are consequent to Notch activity during axon target sorting. If they are, that would suggest that such molecular differences emerge only after that competition between cells is initiated.
