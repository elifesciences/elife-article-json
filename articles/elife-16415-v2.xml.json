It is assumed that synovial joints first evolved as vertebrates came to land, with ray-finned fishes lacking lubricated joints. Here, we examine the expression and function of a critical lubricating protein of mammalian synovial joints, Prg4/Lubricin, in diverse ray-finned fishes. We find that <i>Prg4</i> homologs are specifically enriched at the jaw and pectoral fin joints of zebrafish, stickleback, and gar, with genetic deletion of the zebrafish <i>prg4b</i> gene resulting in the same age-related degeneration of joints as seen in lubricin-deficient mice and humans. Our data support lubricated synovial joints evolving much earlier than currently accepted, at least in the common ancestor of all bony vertebrates. Establishment of the first arthritis model in the highly regenerative zebrafish will offer unique opportunities to understand the aetiology and possible treatment of synovial joint disease."

It is assumed that synovial joints first evolved as vertebrates came to land, with ray-finned fishes lacking lubricated joints. Here, we examine the expression and function of a critical lubricating protein of mammalian synovial joints, Prg4/Lubricin, in diverse ray-finned fishes. We find that <i>Prg4</i> homologs are specifically enriched at the jaw and pectoral fin joints of zebrafish, stickleback, and gar, with genetic deletion of the zebrafish <i>prg4b</i> gene resulting in the same age-related degeneration of joints as seen in lubricin-deficient mice and humans. Our data support lubricated synovial joints evolving much earlier than currently accepted, at least in the common ancestor of all bony vertebrates. Establishment of the first arthritis model in the highly regenerative zebrafish will offer unique opportunities to understand the aetiology and possible treatment of synovial joint disease."

However, by studying zebrafish, Askary, Smeeton et al. now show that fish do have lubricated joints; in fact, the joints in the jaw and fins of zebrafish have a similar structure to those in humans. These zebrafish joints make an important protein called Lubricin that is known to lubricate joints in mice and humans. Furthermore, analyzing two other fish species \u2013 a stickleback and a primitive fish called a spotted gar \u2013 revealed that fish joints in general produce Lubricin. This pushes back the evolutionary origins of lubricated joints millions of years, to at least the common ancestor of all backboned animals."

These mutant fish developed the same early onset arthritis as mice and humans that lack Lubricin. Studying such fish should allow new approaches to be developed that will help us to understand how debilitating joint diseases progress. As zebrafish are highly regenerative, future studies could also explore whether they can regenerate damaged joints, which could spur new strategies for treating and reversing arthritis."

The synovial cavity is enclosed by a membrane, which is often strengthened externally by a fibrous capsule and contains lubricating molecules, such as hyaluronic acid and lubricin, that reduce friction at the joint surface (<a href=\"#bib17\">Koyama et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Rhee et al., 2005</a>). A prevailing hypothesis is that lubricated synovial joints first evolved in tetrapods in response to newfound mechanical challenges imposed on the weight-bearing joints of nascent limbs (<a href=\"#bib29\">van der Kraan, 2013a</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib30\">2013b</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Whereas previous histological studies had suggested that the jaw joints of lungfish (a lobe-finned fish like humans) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bemis, 1986</a>), and potentially longnose gar and sturgeon (ray-finned fishes) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Haines, 1942</a>), have synovial-like morphology, the extent to which these joints are molecularly and functionally similar to tetrapod synovial joints had remained untested. In particular, the assumption that ray-finned fishes lack the sophisticated types of lubricated joints found in humans has hampered the use of the zebrafish model for the study of synovial joint diseases such as arthritis. By examining the expression and function of homologs of a critical lubricating protein of mammalian joints, Lubricin, we provide evidence that certain joints of adult zebrafish are indeed true synovial joints."

Bone \u03bcCT of adult zebrafish shows that the jaw joint, an articulation between the anguloarticular and quadrate bones, resembles a hinge joint (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), with manual opening and closing of the mouth in fixed Alcian-Blue-stained animals revealing movement in a single plane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). While study of zebrafish has contributed to our understanding of the embryonic development of the jaw joint, zebrafish larvae at the most commonly studied stage, 6 days post-fertilization (dpf), show little evidence of a synovial cavity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Miller et al., 2003</a>). However, whether this joint acquires synovial characteristics later had not been described. Our histological investigations revealed the variable presence of a partial cavity as early as 14 dpf, and a prominent and consistently present cavity by 28 dpf (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). In adult zebrafish (12 months post-fertilization, mpf), distinct layers of flattened articular chondrocytes line the jaw joint cavity, with hypertrophic chondrocytes located beneath the articular surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). We also observed similar cavities lined by flattened chondrocytes in joints of the pectoral fin in adult zebrafish, in particular between the proximal and distal radials and between the marginal ray and scapula (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,G</a>). We next used <i>sox10</i> and <i>tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome 1 (trps1</i>) transgenes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Askary et al., 2015</a>) to visualize jaw joint cavitation over time in living zebrafish. At 3, 7, and 14 dpf, the early chondrocyte marker <i>trps1</i>:GFP labels the subset of <i>sox10</i>:dsRed+ chondrocytes at the joint surface, with a partial cavity variably apparent at 14 dpf (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). At 1, 2 and 8 mpf, <i>trps1</i>:GFP is maintained in articular chondrocytes as the cavity expands, with a subset of cells marked by <i>sox10</i>:dsRed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>). In the jaw of the relatively small zebrafish, the presence of a cavity and joint-lining cells, with a minimal fibrous capsule, is consistent with it being a synovial-like joint in miniature, similar to the homologous incudomalleolar synovial joint of the mammalian middle ear (<a href=\"#bib32\">Whyte et al., 2002</a>)."

In the jaw joint of the larger spotted gar (standard length 10.2 cm), an internal one-cell-thick membrane and thick external fibrous capsule enclosed the cavity, with joint cartilage divided into the same superficial, transitional, radial, and calcified layers seen in mammalian synovial joints (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J,K</a>). The presence of these additional morphological features in the gar jaw supports synovial-like features being an ancestral property of bony vertebrates."

Chondrocytes lining mammalian synovial joints differ from those in the growth plate by expressing <i>Prg4</i>, which encodes a lubricin proteoglycan that forms a cross-linked network with hyaluronan and Aggrecan to\u00a0reduce friction across the joint surface (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jay and Waller, 2014</a>). Consistent with the appearance of a synovial cavity in juvenile stages, we find that the joint-lining cells of the zebrafish jaw express <i>prg4b</i> starting from 15 dpf and continuing throughout adulthood (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). We observed much weaker levels of expression at other joints of the face, such as the midline ceratohyal-ceratohyal joint (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, arrowhead) and hyoid joint (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), which lack synovial morphology. Expression of <i>prg4b</i> was not detected in the jaw joint at earlier stages (7 dpf, data not shown), consistent with the late onset of <i>Prg4</i> expression at mammalian joints (<a href=\"#bib24\">Rhee et al., 2005</a>). In addition, <i>prg4b</i> expression appeared in joint-lining cells of the synovial-like ray-scapula articulation of the pectoral fin at 3 mpf, but not in the non-synovial intervertebral discs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>). Zebrafish also expressed <i>prg4b</i> outside of joints, including conserved expression with mammalian <i>Prg4</i> in liver (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ikegawa et al., 2000</a>) and possibly ligaments (<a href=\"#bib27\">Sun et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,G</a>). Similar to zebrafish, stickleback expressed <i>prg4b</i> and gar expressed <i>prg4</i> in joint-lining cells of the juvenile jaw (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H\u2013J</a>). In contrast, the related <i>prg4a</i> gene is not enriched at the jaw joint in either zebrafish or stickleback, instead showing expression throughout cartilage (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Of note, the lineage leading to the spotted gar diverged before the teleost genome duplication (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amores et al., 2011</a>), resulting in zebrafish and stickleback having two <i>Prg4</i> co-orthologs and gar a single ortholog (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Analysis of the single <i>prg4</i> gene in gar therefore reveals that enriched expression of <i>Prg4</i> within articular chondrocytes existed before the divergence of ray-finned and lobe-finned vertebrates."

We therefore asked whether expression of <i>Prg4</i> orthologs by cells lining synovial-like joints in ray-finned fishes reflects a conserved requirement of lubricin protein in lubricating and hence maintaining these joints. To do so, we used TALE nucleases (<a href=\"#bib11\">Huang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Sander et al., 2011</a>) to generate loss-of-function deletion alleles for zebrafish <i>prg4a</i> and <i>prg4b</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Mice lacking <i>Prg4</i> function (<a href=\"#bib17\">Koyama et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Rhee et al., 2005</a>) and humans with homozygous loss of <i>PRG4</i> in Camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome (<a href=\"#bib19\">Marcelino et al., 1999</a>) have a progressive deterioration of joint surfaces that includes loss of articular chondrocytes, accumulation of acellular matrix in the cavity, synovial hyperplasia, and thickening of the deep chondrocyte layer. Consistent with the lack of early joint defects in <i>Prg4-/-</i> mice, zebrafish doubly mutant for <i>prg4a</i> and <i>prg4b</i> had no defects in the jaw joint at either 6 dpf or 1 mpf and no gross defects of the adult skeleton (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>). However, <i>prg4a-/-; prg4b-/-</i> zebrafish began to display a weak accumulation of acellular matrix in limited domains of the joint surface at 2 mpf (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), a phenotype that became more severe by 6 mpf (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). By 12 mpf, <i>prg4a-/-; prg4b-/-</i> zebrafish had multiple jaw joint abnormalities, including an acellular matrix at the joint surface, synovial hyperplasia, increased numbers of deep chondrocytes, and in some cases complete erosion of the joint surface accompanied by underlying bone defects (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and additional examples in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Defects found in <i>prg4a-/-; prg4b-/-</i> double mutants were also not confined to the jaw joint, appearing in the ray-scapula and inter-radial joints of the pectoral fin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). Further, consistent with only <i>prg4b</i> being enriched in jaw joint chondrocytes, <i>prg4b</i> but not <i>prg4a</i> single mutants displayed ray-scapula fin joint defects and a similar severity of jaw joint defects as double mutants at 12 mpf (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In contrast, we detected no changes in the hyoid joints of the face and the intervertebral discs in 12 mpf <i>prg4a-/-; prg4b-/-</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>), consistent with these joints lacking synovial cavities and high-level <i>prg4b</i> expression.

Contrary to existing dogma (<a href=\"#bib30\">van der Kraan, 2013b</a>), our data suggest that lubricated synovial joints evolved before vertebrates moved onto land in at least the common ancestor to all bony vertebrates. Although fish are not subject to gravity in the same way as tetrapods, the evolution of synovial joints in fish-like ancestors may have facilitated movement of first the jaw, and then the fins, against water resistance. Interestingly, recent studies show that the radial joints of the pectoral fin, which we find to have synovial morphology and <i>prg4b</i> dependency in zebrafish, are homologous to those of the tetrapod wrist (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gehrke et al., 2015</a>). The existence of these synovial joints at the base of the pectoral fins of ancestral bony fish may therefore have facilitated their later functional evolution into the larger synovial joints of tetrapod limbs. Our findings show that zebrafish can be a relevant model to understand the development of synovial specializations, including the poorly understood process of cavitation. The establishment of the first genetic model of arthritis in zebrafish will also allow a better understanding of the developmental progression of synovial joint disease. In the future, it will be exciting to test whether the articular cartilage lining synovial joints, which is affected in arthritis, displays the same regenerative potential as many of the other tissues in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib16\">Knopf et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Morgan, 1900</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Poss et al., 2002</a>)."

For embedding, the tissue was first dehydrated through a series of ethanol washes (30, 50, 70, 95, and 100%) for 20\u2009min each. Then ethanol was replaced with xylene substitute Hemo-De (Electron Microscopy Sciences,\u00a0Hatfield,\u00a0PA) in a series of 15\u2009min washes (50, 75, and 100% Hemo-De). The\u00a0samples were then incubated in a 1:1 Hemo-De:paraffin (Paraplast X-tra, VWR,\u00a0Radnor,\u00a0PA) solution at 65\u00b0C for an hour before an overnight incubation in 100% paraffin at 65\u00b0C. The following day, the\u00a0samples were embedded in freshly melted paraffin. Larval and juvenile samples were prepared following the same general procedure with shorter fixation and decalcification steps (2 days fixation and 4 days decalcification). Animals younger than 3 weeks did not require decalcification. Juvenile stickleback and spotted gar samples were processed as above for adult zebrafish with the following changes: stickleback were decalcified in 20% EDTA for 7 days at room temperature; isolated spotted gar heads were fixed in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C for 10\u201314 days and decalcified in 20% EDTA for 14 days at room temperature. For hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E;) staining, 5\u2009\u03bcm paraffin sections were deparaffinized with xylene and re-hydrated through an ethanol series to distilled water.

Following 2 \u00d7 2\u2009min in Hemo-De, samples were mounted with cytoseal (Richard-Allan Scientific,\u00a0Kalamazoo,\u00a0MI) for imaging. For Trichrome staining, 5\u2009\u03bcm paraffin sections were deparaffinized with xylene and re-hydrated through an ethanol series to distilled water. Trichrome stain was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions using the Trichrome, Gomori One-Step, Aniline Blue Stain (Newcomer Supply,\u00a0Middleton,\u00a0WI). For SafraninO staining, 5\u2009\u03bcm paraffin sections were deparaffinized with xylene and re-hydrated to distilled water.

Following sequence confirmation, digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled antisense probes were synthesized using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche,\u00a0Switzerland). In situ hybridization protocol was modified from (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lien et al., 2006</a>). In brief, after de-paraffinization, slides were digested in 7.5 \u00b5g/ml proteinase K for 5\u2009min and fixed in 4% PFA/0.2% gluteraldehyde for 20\u2009min. Each slide was incubated overnight at 65\u00b0C with 1 \u03bcg of DIG-labeled riboprobe diluted in hybridization buffer. After hybridization, slides were washed three times in 1x SSC/Formamide at 65\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, and three times in MABT for 15\u2009min. Following 1\u2009hr of blocking in 2% Blocking Buffer (Roche), hybridization was detected with anti-DIG-AP antibody (Roche, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resources/Any/search?q=AB_514497&amp;l=AB_514497\">AB_514497</a>) and developed with NBT/BCIP substrate colorimetric reaction (Roche). Slides were counterstained with nuclear fast red (Vector Laboratories,\u00a0Burlingame,\u00a0CA) prior to mounting."

TALENs were designed and constructed as described previously (<a href=\"#bib26\">Sanjana et al., 2012</a>). TALEN pairs were targeted toward the following sequences in the zebrafish genome: TTGGTCTCTTCTGGCTCTGC and TCGTCTGCTGCTCAGGGTGA for <i>prg4a</i> 5\u2019 TALENs, TAGGCGTCCCGTCACCCATT and CGCTGCAACTGCCAGGGCAA for <i>prg4a</i> 3\u2019 TALENs, TGCTGTTTGTGTGGGTCTCC and CACGTAAGCCAACAGATCGA for <i>prg4b</i> 5\u2019 TALENs, and TCCCCCAGCTGCAGCACTGG and TCTCACGAACCTGGAGAGGA for <i>prg4b</i> 3\u2019 TALENs. ARCA-capped RNA for each TALEN was transcribed in vitro using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra Kit (Life Technologies,\u00a0Carlsbad,\u00a0CA). The RNA for four TALENs corresponding to each gene were mixed and injected into one-cell stage embryos to generate founder lines. Founders were then outcrossed to wild-type fish and the progenies were tested for genomic deletions. Deletion alleles were identified in the F1 generation by cloning and sequencing of amplicons that span the TALEN target sites for each gene. We obtained single <i>prg4a<sup>el687</sup></i>\u00a0(7686 bp deletion) and <i>prg4b<sup>el594</sup></i>\u00a0(11,638 bp deletion) alleles by screening the progeny of 6 and 21 injected animals, respectively.
