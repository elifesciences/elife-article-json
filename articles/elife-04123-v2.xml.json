Most models of clustering are specific to particular systems, and relationships between physical properties of the clusters and their molecular components are not well understood. We report biochemical reconstitution on supported lipid bilayers of protein clusters containing the adhesion receptor Nephrin and its cytoplasmic partners, Nck and N-WASP. With Nephrin attached to the bilayer, multivalent interactions enable these proteins to polymerize on the membrane surface and undergo two-dimensional phase separation, producing micrometer-sized clusters. Dynamics and thermodynamics of the clusters are modulated by the valencies and affinities of the interacting species. In the presence of the Arp2/3 complex, the clusters assemble actin filaments, suggesting that clustering of regulatory factors could promote local actin assembly at membranes. Interactions between multivalent proteins could be a general mechanism for cytoplasmic adaptor proteins to organize membrane receptors into micrometer-scale signaling zones."

Examples include cadherins (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yap et al., 1997</a>), Eph receptors (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nikolov et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Seiradake et al., 2013</a>), immune receptors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Goldstein and Perelson, 1984</a>), apoptotic signaling receptors (<a href=\"#bib29\">Henkler et al., 2005</a>), chemotaxis receptors (<a href=\"#bib46\">Li et al., 2011</a>), GPI anchored proteins (<a href=\"#bib66\">Varma and Mayor, 1998</a>) and components of T cell signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balagopalan et al., 2013</a>). A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this higher-order organization. The extracellular domains of cadherins and Eph receptors have been postulated to interact laterally in homotypic fashion within the plasma membrane to produce large-scale assemblies at sites of cell\u2013cell adhesion (<a href=\"#bib30\">Himanen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Seiradake et al., 2013</a>). Modeling studies have suggested that binding of divalent antibodies to the extracellular domain of trivalent Fc\u03b5 receptors could lead to large networks, which could account for Fc\u03b5 receptor puncta observed in cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Goldstein and Perelson, 1984</a>). An analogous mechanism has been proposed for intracellular interactions of the oligomeric receptor, Fas, with its oligomeric adaptor protein FADD (<a href=\"#bib62\">Scott et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wu, 2013</a>) to produce clusters of the receptors hundreds of nanometers in size (<a href=\"#bib65\">Siegel et al., 2004</a>). Similarly, dimeric bacterial chemoreceptors such as Tsr are linked together by their downstream partners CheA and CheW, forming trimers of dimers resulting in a highly ordered and conserved hexagonal array that is suggested to be the basic unit of polar clusters (<a href=\"#bib6\">Briegel et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2014</a>). GPI-anchored proteins and lipid-anchored Ras have been shown to organize into dynamic clusters of 4\u20137 molecules through transient interactions with lipids and the cortical actin\u2013myosin network (<a href=\"#bib57\">Plowman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Goswami et al., 2008</a>). Such clusters of GPI-anchored proteins are also believed to play an important role in creation of dynamic nanometer scale cholesterol-rich lipid domains, which further contribute to organization of the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sharma et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gowrishankar et al., 2012</a>). Finally, data suggest that clustering of T cell receptors may arise in part from size differences, and consequent steric occlusion, between the extracellular domains of different membrane proteins found at contacts between T cells and antigen presenting cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">James and Vale, 2012</a>)."

However, for several reasons most of them are difficult to generalize in a predictive manner to new systems. First, the models hinge on molecular interactions that are specific to the individual systems and that are not readily apparent from protein sequence features alone. Thus, with the exception of GPI-anchored proteins, which likely behave similarly as a group, in the absence of a fairly detailed physical characterization it is difficult to predict whether any new protein/system is likely to produce membrane clusters, and if so, which clustering models are most appropriate. Additionally, with the exception of the nanometer scale clusters of GPI-anchored proteins and lipid-modified Ras, the physical properties of most receptor clusters have not been extensively characterized. Clustering models have derived in many cases from molecular packing in crystal lattices and have been analyzed largely through cellular studies showing qualitative consistency with structural studies and theoretical analyses. But in general, the physical properties of the clusters (e.g., their thermodynamic and kinetic properties) have not been correlated to the physical parameters of the molecules that compose them nor have the key molecular properties that influence cluster properties been identified. This shortcoming arises partly because the models have not been examined through in vitro biochemical reconstitution, where the parameters of the system can be tightly controlled and the physical properties of the clusters can be analyzed in detail. Finally, the functional consequences of macroscopic clustering (as distinct from association to create defined oligomers\u2013dimers, trimers, etc) are not well understood. But it is notable that many clustered receptors signal to the actin cytoskeleton, and that many of their downstream targets, such as actin nucleation promoting factors in the WASP family, are also known to form micrometer sized clusters at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yamaguchi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Weiner et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gomez and Billadeau, 2009</a>). These observations suggest that one function of receptor clustering may be to control the localization, structure, and/or dynamics of actin filament networks."

This occurs concomitant with assembly of the proteins into large polymers, through a sol\u2013gel transition, as observed in many other multivalent systems in polymer science (<a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 2012</a>). In three-dimensional solution, this process produces phase separated protein polymers that organize into dynamic micron sized liquid droplets. These droplets are formed in a sharp transition as protein concentration in solution is increased. The critical concentration for droplet formation depends on valency and affinity of interacting species, and the proteins are highly concentrated within the droplets. We have studied this phenomenon in a variety of model multivalent systems, involving both protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013RNA interactions, and also in an actin regulatory signaling pathway involving the adhesion receptor, Nephrin, and its intracellular targets Nck and N-WASP (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jones et al., 2006</a>). In the latter, phase separation can be controlled by multivalent phosphorylation of Nephrin and results in enhanced signaling activity of N-WASP."

But in vivo Nephrin is an integral membrane protein; therefore its cytoplasmic tail is attached to membranes (<a href=\"#bib71\">Welsh and Saleem, 2010</a>). The behavior of multivalent\u2013multivalent interaction systems in such a two-dimensional arrangement remained unresolved. In this study, we show that multivalency-induced polymerization and phase separation can also occur in two-dimensional systems, generating micrometer-size protein clusters at membranes. When phosphorylated Nephrin is attached to supported lipid bilayers of DOPC, addition of Nck and N-WASP induce formation of micron-sized concentrated puncta containing all three proteins. Puncta form abruptly when a critical concentration of Nck/N-WASP is reached and are highly dynamic. The critical concentration is appreciably lower for two-dimensional puncta formation than for three-dimensional droplet formation, and it depends on the phosphotyrosine and SH3 domain valencies of p-Nephrin and Nck, respectively, and also on the affinity of the Nck SH2 domain for p-Nephrin. These data suggest that puncta formation is driven by polymerization of the proteins in a plane adjacent to the membrane. In the presence of actin and the N-WASP target, the Arp2/3 complex, puncta formation causes focal actin assembly. Our biochemical approach has allowed us to control the clustering process and discover key parameters that control puncta formation. Our study demonstrates that specific protein\u2013protein interactions result in the formation of macroscopic clusters without the necessity of lipid segregation or actin\u2013myosin assembly. This clustering can be defined as phase separation of proteins on the surface of a membrane. Our observations here and previously (<a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 2012</a>) suggest that polymerization and phase separation of multivalent macromolecules may represent a general mechanism to produce two- and three-dimensional dynamic and highly concentrated micron-sized structures in cells."

The integrity of the slit diaphragm requires intracellular assembly of actin filaments downstream of the Nephrin cytoplasmic tail (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jones et al., 2006</a>). When Nephrin is crosslinked by antibodies, its cytoplasmic tail can be phosphorylated by the Src family kinase, Fyn (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jones et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Verma et al., 2006</a>). Three phosphotyrosines (pTyrs) in the tail bind the SH2 domain of the Nck adaptor protein, which in turn uses its three SH3 domains to bind multiple proline-rich motifs (PRMs) in the actin regulatory protein, N-WASP. N-WASP then recruits and promotes activation of the Arp2/3 complex, which generates branched actin filament networks through nucleating new actin polymers. Mutations that disrupt this pathway in humans and mice result in disorganization of the slit diaphragm and defects in the glomerular filter that cause proteinuria (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jones et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2009</a>)."

To test this hypothesis, we began by generating the triply phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail of Nephrin (amino acids 1174\u20131223, phosphorylated at Tyr1176, Tyr1193, and Tyr1217, and mutated from Tyr to Phe at residues 1183 and 1210, sites not believed to bind Nck (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jones et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Verma et al., 2006</a>); called p-Nephrin hereafter). The construct contained a His<sub>8</sub> tag at its N-terminus, followed by a (Gly-Gly-Ser)<sub>5</sub> linker containing a cysteine, which was covalently labeled with maleimide Alexa488 fluorophore.

Addition of 1 \u00b5M Nck causes no change in the distribution of p-Nephrin on the membrane, despite clear association of Nck with the bilayer (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1<b>\u2014</b>figure supplement 1B</a>). Similarly, 1 \u00b5M of an N-WASP construct containing the basic proline-rich and VCA regions of the protein (residues 183\u2013193, 273\u2013501, N-WASP hereafter) does not change the p-Nephrin distribution. However, addition of 1 \u00b5M Nck and 1 \u00b5M N-WASP together causes p-Nephrin to organize into micron-sized clusters (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Unphosphorylated Nephrin remains uniformly distributed under these conditions (not shown), indicating that clustering requires binding the Nck SH2 domain to pTyr sites on Nephrin. Labeling of Nck or N-WASP with fluorophores (Alexa 568 or Alexa 647, respectively) shows that the clusters contain all three protein components (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Quantitative analysis indicated that the clustered regions contain up to fourfold higher density of p-Nephrin than the surrounding regions of the bilayer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Note that much higher concentrations of Nck and N-WASP (\u223c40 \u00b5M and \u223c15 \u00b5M, respectively [<a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 2012</a>]) are required to form phase-separated droplets in solution than to induce p-Nephrin clustering on membranes. Thus, clustering does not involve adhesion of pre-existing three dimensional Nck/N-WASP droplets to membrane-bound p-Nephrin, but rather de novo assembly of the proteins together on the bilayer surface. Further, the DOPC/DOGS lipids in our experiments do not phase-separate, indicating that clustering is independent of lipid phase separation."

                                "text": "To understand the concentration dependence of cluster formation, we fixed the concentration of N-WASP at 500 nM and the density of p-Nephrin at 2700 \u00b1 200 molecules/\u03bcm<sup>2</sup> (see density control and measurement in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, also <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1, 2</a>) and added increasing concentrations of Nck. We used two measures to determine the onset of clustering. First, we used a thresholding approach to identify and quantify bright regions of the membrane, which we define as clusters. As detailed in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, two different thresholding procedures gave virtually identical results in this approach. After thresholding, we calculated the fraction of total membrane fluorescence intensity that is present in the clusters. As a second independent approach, we determined the variance of the fluorescence signal across the bilayer image, which also increases as bright regions form. Using either approach, we found that p-Nephrin clusters appear in a highly non-linear fashion as Nck concentration in solution increases. Clusters are essentially absent at low concentrations of Nck but form quite sharply once a critical concentration is reached (\u223c200 nM, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We note that the sharp increase in variance and the coincidence of the critical concentration measured by both methods speak against the possibility that small clusters are forming in a more gradual fashion but are too dim to be recognized by the thresholding approach. The average density of p-Nephrin on the membrane does not change during the titration (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We define the concentration at which fractional intensity and variance begin increasing as the clustering concentration. The highly cooperative nature of the cluster formation on bilayers is reminiscent of the sharp phase transitions observed in forming p-Nephrin/Nck/N-WASP liquid droplets in three-dimensional solutions (<a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 2012</a>). The clusters are distributed randomly (Gaussian distribution) across the membrane (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), consistent with a stochastic assembly process, where the clusters are nucleated and grow independent of one other (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dill and Bromberg, 2003</a>). The clusters also show a broad range of sizes that can be fit well to an exponential distribution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), similar to that observed for stochastically assembled chemotaxis receptors in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib28\">Greenfield et al., 2009</a>). These properties suggest a stochastic process of cluster formation in our system. In contrast, clusters of GPI-anchored proteins in cells do not show a Gaussian spatial distribution nor a broad size distribution, indicating their active control by the cortical actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib25\">Goswami et al., 2008</a>)."

Distinct puncta are no longer observed, and the clustered regions span the entire field of view (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These data are consistent with low- and high-density p-Nephrin phase separating via nucleation and spinodal decomposition mechanisms, respectively (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dill and Bromberg, 2003</a>), as observed in non-biological phase separating systems in material science (<a href=\"#bib78\">Zinke-Allmang et al., 1992</a>). Together, these data strongly suggest that the clustering of p-Nephrin occurs through a phase transition of the molecules on the surface of the membrane in response to binding of Nck and N-WASP."

On short timescales, the edges of clusters show substantial fluctuations, extending and retracting in seconds (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). On timescales of minutes, these fluctuations lead to coalescence of small clusters into increasingly larger structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1, 2</a>). We also rarely observe apparent fission events, where a larger cluster seems to split into two smaller structures (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). These behaviors suggest that p-Nephrin clusters are fluid-like. The size distribution of the clusters depends on the initial p-Nephrin density and time after Nck/N-WASP addition, reflecting variable contributions of nucleation, growth through monomer addition and coalescence, and Ostwald ripening throughout the process (<a href=\"#bib78\">Zinke-Allmang et al., 1992</a>). At lower density (2500 molecules/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>) the distribution is exponential at all times we examined (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), while at higher density (4000 molecules/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>) the distribution follows a power law (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). At a given time after Nck/N-WASP addition, higher density produces a larger average cluster size and correspondingly a larger fraction of total area covered by the clusters (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>, respectively), most likely due to the larger degree of coalescence at higher cluster densities. A detailed mechanistic understanding of these behaviors will be goal of future efforts."

In individual experiments, we labeled either p-Nephrin, Nck, or N-WASP with Alexa488 and examined FRAP behavior of the labeled component. Within the clusters, each of the proteins recovers nearly fully in tens to hundreds of seconds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thus, even though the clusters themselves are persistent for hours, the individual components exchange with the surroundings on time-scales of seconds to minutes. The recovery profiles can all be fit to a double-exponential but do not fit to a single-exponential (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for F-test statistics). N-WASP shows recovery time constants of \u03c4-fast = 2.6 s (37%) and \u03c4-slow = 43 s (63%). Nck recovers with \u03c4-fast = 1.6 s (49%) and \u03c4-slow = 72 s (51%). p-Nephrin recovers with \u03c4-fast = 86 s (76%) and \u03c4-slow = 526 s (24%). In the non-clustered regions, p-nephrin recovery can be fit well to a single-exponential, with \u03c4 = 31 s, similar to the fast phase in the clusters but appreciably slower than recovery in the absence of Nck/N-WASP, where \u03c4 = 1.3 s (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In independent experiments we found that the dissociation of p-nephrin from the membrane occurs much more slowly than these rates (\u03c4 = 2080 s, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), indicating that the FRAP recovery of the protein is largely due to two-dimensional diffusion within the bilayer. By contrast, Nck and N-WASP likely recover through a combination of diffusion in the plane of the bilayer as well as binding and dissociation from the membrane. We recognize that the kinetic processes here must represent the convolution of multiple molecular processes, given the complex oligomeric/polymeric nature of the clusters (see below). Nevertheless, the data suggest that both the clustered regions and non-clustered regions contain small assemblies that slow p-nephrin dynamics relative to its free diffusion in the bilayer. The clustered region likely contains additional assemblies that are larger and have greater degrees of crosslinking that appreciably slow dynamics further."

To examine whether such polymerization is also occurring in the two-dimensional system, we initially compared the critical concentrations of singly-, doubly-, and triply-phosphorylated nephrin (Nephrin1pY, Nephrin2pY, and p-Nephrin, respectively; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for specific phosphorylation sites). Previous studies showed that the three nephrin pTyr sites have essentially identical affinities for the Nck SH2 domain (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blasutig et al., 2008</a>). Thus, these constructs differ largely in pTyr valency, rather than inherent affinity for Nck. At a membrane density of 1000 molecules/\u03bcm<sup>2</sup> and in the presence of 500 nM N-WASP, p-Nephrin begins to show clusters at 200\u2013300 nM Nck. Under the same conditions, Nephrin2pY and Nephrin1pY do not cluster even at Nck concentrations greater than 10 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) nor with their own densities increased to 3000 molecules/\u03bcm<sup>2</sup>. If the concentrations of N-WASP and Nck are increased to 2 \u00b5M and 5 \u00b5M, respectively, Nephrin2pY produces clusters (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, even at 5 \u00b5M N-WASP and 10 \u00b5M Nck, Nephrin1pY does not cluster (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, the valency of nephrin phosphorylation can control the critical concentration for puncta formation, as in the three-dimensional phase separation of this system (<a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 2012</a>)."

The SH3 domains were separated by the natural linker between the first and second SH3 domains. At 500 nM N-WASP, the trivalent molecule (SH3)<sub>3</sub> induces clustering at 200 nM (SH3 module concentration), whereas the di-valent (SH3)<sub>2</sub> and monovalent (SH3)<sub>1</sub> molecules do not cluster even at concentrations above 10 \u00b5M of the SH3 module concentrations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Increasing N-WASP concentration to 5 \u00b5M and (SH3)<sub>2</sub> concentration to 5 \u00b5M (SH3 module concentration) produced clusters, whereas clusters were absent even with 5 \u00b5M N-WASP and 5 \u00b5M (SH3)<sub>1</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The binding affinity of the p-Nephrin motif to the SH2 domain of Nck is 370 nM, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For the p-TIR motif the affinity to the SH2 domain is 40 nM. In the presence of p-TIR, at a density of 2000 molecules/\u03bcm<sup>2</sup>, the clustering concentration of the trivalent SH3 protein, (SH3)<sub>3</sub>, is 100 nM, as opposed to 200 nM for p-Nephrin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The higher affinity interaction also slows the recovery of Nck, as FRAP data demonstrate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Fitting to a double-exponential, Nck shows recovery rate constants of \u03c4-fast = 6.5 s (46%) and \u03c4-slow = 89.5 s (54%) when the clusters of p-TIR/Nck/N-WASP were photobleached. However, Nck shows recovery rates of \u03c4-fast = 1.6 s (49%) and \u03c4-slow = 73.2 s (51%) when the clusters of p-Nephrin/Nck/N-WASP were photobleached. The data would be consistent with \u03c4-fast being governed by processes based on dissociation of Nck from pTyr sites on Nephrin/TIR (which are likely slower in the high affinity system) and \u03c4-slow being governed by diffusion of large assemblies in the membrane (which are expected to be similar in the two cases). Together, the data show that both the clustering concentrations and the dynamics of the clusters can be affected by molecular affinities, as expected of a crosslinked polymer network."

Actin fluorescence remains coincident with Nephrin throughout this process, indicating that the signaling molecules are reorganized by the assembling filaments. Shortly after the appearance of actin on a cluster, the structure changes from having relatively rounded edges to having many thin hair-like projections from its periphery. These projections coalesce over time to give the puncta star-like morphologies. For reasons we cannot currently explain, between 42 and 45 min, well after all of the clusters have recruited significant actin, there is a dramatic change in cluster morphology, such that the puncta appear to shatter into a large number of short linear structures (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The clusters form through a thermodynamic phase transition that is driven by oligomerization/polymerization of the proteins through their modular binding domains. The occurrence of a phase transition is supported by the sharpness with which clusters appear as Nck concentration is increased and the temporal sharpness of cluster disappearance after a monovalent competitor is added. The importance of polymerization/oligomerization is supported by the valency- and affinity-dependence of the critical concentration and also by the dissolution of clusters by a monovalent competitor. The clusters appear to be polymers/oligomers of the three proteins, as evidenced by the dependence of FRAP rate on the affinity of the Nck SH2 domain for the pTyr sites on Nephrin. The clusters assemble actin through the Arp2/3 complex and can themselves be dynamically remodeled by the resultant filament network. Our work demonstrates that, as in three-dimensional systems, multivalent polymerization and phase separation can control micron-scale spatial organization (and likely biochemical activity) of signaling pathways."

This often occurs concomitant with concentration of the receptors into micron-sized puncta (<a href=\"#bib19\">Douglass and Vale, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Salaita et al., 2010</a>). Where examined, these puncta persist over many minutes, but exchange molecules in seconds with the surroundings, similar to the p-Nephrin/Nck/N-WASP puncta we have generated here. Further, many of these receptors have been shown, through combinations of biochemistry and genetics, to use the pTyr modifications to engage signaling networks composed of proteins with multiple modular binding domains, often (but not exclusively) combinations of SH2 domains, SH3 domains, PRMs, and additional pTyr sites. Examples of processes controlled by such pathways include T cell activation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dustin et al., 2010</a>), invadopodia formation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Oser et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bergman et al., 2014</a>), myoblast fusion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abmayr and Pavlath, 2012</a>), neurite self-avoidance (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen and Maniatis, 2013</a>), and cell\u2013matrix interactions through focal adhesions (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hoffmann et al., 2014</a>). The molecules that control these processes have the capacity to function analogous to the Nephrin/Nck/N-WASP system studied here. We hypothesize that coupled polymerization and phase separation may contribute to the formation of macroscopic puncta in these systems and others that are composed similarly."

At high densities, a receptor containing a single motif behaves effectively in multivalent fashion and can then cluster through interactions with multivalent ligands. For example, proteins with multiple PDZ domains interact with voltage-gated Kv1.4 channels, which are found in clusters at the cell-surface (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burke et al., 1999</a>). Further, membrane receptors are often oligomeric in nature. For example, EGF receptors have been reported to form pre-formed oligomers in the absence of ligand (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clayton et al., 2008</a>), effectively increasing the valency of their cytoplasmic tails. Thus, there are a variety of ways that the basic concept of multivalent polymerization and phase separation could be manifested in specific signaling systems."

These often contain the adaptor proteins Nck or Crk/CrkL, linked upstream to pTyr-containing proteins and downstream to proline-rich proteins including members of the WASP family (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buday et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Antoku et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Noy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chaki and Rivera, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kaipa et al., 2013</a>). In this regard, it is notable that over half of the 29 known ligands of the Nck SH2 domain contain two or more (up to 16 in p130 CAS) predicted and/or demonstrated Nck binding sites (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lettau et al., 2009</a>). Further, almost all WASP proteins have large proline-rich regions with multiple SH3-binding PRMs (<a href=\"#bib54\">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</a>). The only exception is WASH, which has a small proline-rich region. However, WASH is constitutively associated with the Fam21 protein, which has a large disordered tail that contains 21 so-called LFa peptide motifs that can bind the membrane-associated retromer complex (<a href=\"#bib14\">Derivery et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gomez and Billadeau, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jia et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2012</a>). Thus WASH may have a conceptually similar but molecularly distinct mechanism of assembling into large structures. This general behavior suggests that clustering may play an important role in spatial and temporal control of actin dynamics. Consistent with this idea, several groups have demonstrated that increased density of WASP proteins corresponds to increased activity towards the Arp2/3 complex. Pantaloni and colleagues have shown that the rate of actin-based motility of N-WASP-coated beads increases non-linearly with increasing WASP density (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wiesner et al., 2003</a>). Similarly, Ditlev et al. have shown through modeling and cell-based experiments that actin assembly activity scales with the square of N-WASP density at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ditlev et al., 2012</a>). Finally, Padrick et al. showed that a natural consequence of the 2:1 stoichiometry of the WASP:Arp2/3 complex during filament nucleation is that actin assembly activity should increase with the size of WASP clusters and thus the density of WASP at membranes (<a href=\"#bib55\">Padrick et al., 2008</a>). These observations, together with our data here, suggest that clustering of receptors and their proximal adaptors may provide a mechanism of concentrating WASP proteins into high-density puncta and thus increasing their activation of the Arp2/3 complex, providing local bursts of actin filament assembly."

                                "text": "The mechanism we have described is not exclusive of, and in fact is expected to act cooperatively with, many other mechanisms that have been proposed to explain receptor clustering. Interactions between extracellular domains, as proposed for cadherins and Eph receptors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Himanen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Seiradake et al., 2013</a>), will be thermodynamically coupled to assembly of intracellular oligomers/polymers. Similarly, interactions of receptor transmembrane regions with specific lipids, which can promote concentration of receptors into nano-domains enriched in those lipids, should also be thermodynamically coupled to the clustering of receptor cytoplasmic tails (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</a>). Further, ATP-dependent clustering of the cortical acto-myosin system, which promotes oligomerization of GPI-anchored proteins (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sharma et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Goswami et al., 2008</a>), could also promote assembly of a phase separated multivalent network if any components of that network can bind to the cytoskeleton. In this case, the dynamic rearrangements of the acto-myosin system could also control the properties of the signaling clusters (e.g., cluster size and/or lifetime of clusters) and maintain them away from equilibrium. It is important to note that while weak interactions between extracellular domains or between transmembrane regions and lipids or between receptors and the cytoskeleton may not on their own produce significant oligomerization of receptors, these energies could have substantial effects when combined with energies of clustering. Phrased differently, these other interactions could have strong effects on the critical concentrations (or the degree of receptor phosphorylation) needed for phase separation/clustering through adaptor-based intracellular interactions. For any particular system, or for a single system under different conditions, these various mechanisms are likely to be used to different degrees to promote the organization of receptors into macroscopic structures."

                                "text": "The ability of membrane receptors to cluster through multivalent phase separation could have a number of functional implications in cells. The process will generate a sharp switch between different states, which will depend on the concentrations of at least two (and possibly several) species, as well as the degree of receptor phosphorylation in pTyr-dependent cases. Thus, the switch could be tightly controlled, either through relatively slow changes in protein concentration or more rapidly through changes in receptor phosphorylation or oligomerization by extracellular ligands. The phase-separated state will have different density, composition, and dynamics from the surrounding regions of the membrane, each of which could have functional consequences. In the case of actin regulatory systems, we and others have shown that because WASP proteins bind (and activate) Arp2/3 complex in 2:1 fashion, increasing density of WASP proteins leads to non-linear increases in actin assembly activity (<a href=\"#bib55\">Padrick et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ditlev et al., 2012</a>). Thus, clustering should provide not only spatial organization of the actin filament network (decreasing spatial noise [<a href=\"#bib27\">Grecco et al., 2011</a>]) but also increased biochemical signaling activity. This should be true for any signaling system that requires multiple simultaneous or sequential events to generate downstream outputs. The enhancement due to clustering would be particularly strong for systems with positive feedback, as in Arp2/3 complex\u2013actin pathways. In addition to the polymer components themselves, other proteins and lipids could be concentrated into or excluded from the phase-separated structure. This partitioning could be dictated by both specific interactions (e.g., a monovalent SH3 protein could be recruited to the p-Nephrin/Nck/N-WASP clusters by binding the PRMs of N-WASP) as well as non-specific electrostatic and/or hydrophobic interactions with the polymer matrix. The collection of these molecules would then produce a distinct biochemical environment from the surrounding regions, favoring or disfavoring certain reactions or afford specificity to signaling pathways. Since the clusters are temporally stable but readily exchange molecules with the surroundings, they could potentially act as sites of enzymatic modification and release. Finally, the structural and dynamic features of the polymer matrix could also influence the rates and/or specificities of reactions that occur within the clusters."

Previous data showed that the loss of Nck disrupts the filtration capacity of the diaphragm, concomitant with the loss of cortical actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jones et al., 2006</a>). These observations suggest that the pathway from p-Nephrin to actin, and by inference the polymeric network we have described here, is important in maintaining the slit diaphragm. The extracellular portion of Nephrin is composed of multiple IgG domains and FNIII domains. These have been suggested to self-associate, both in trans across the slit diaphragm and in cis within individual cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gerke et al., 2003</a>). The latter should promote polymerization and phase separation of the actin pathway components. Thus, this system may be a case where interactions on both sides of the plasma membrane act cooperatively to produce a polymeric structure with both extracellular functions (the filtration barrier) and intracellular functions (signaling to actin)."

Although only demonstrated here for the p-Nephrin/Nck/N-WASP system, the analogous construction of many signaling pathways suggests that this behavior could be quite general, and relevant to many biological processes. Polymerization and phase separation at membranes could impart spatial organization on these pathways and afford them strongly non-linear activities. Further work in vitro and in vivo will be necessary to determine the extent to which these effects are important in specific biological processes."

Here, a construct of the nephrin cytosolic domain that can be hooked on to the supported bilayers by a lipid tail. This is a nice experimental system where they can follow the reaction dynamics of the liquid droplet formation by different biophysical methods. The data clearly confirm previous conclusion that these four proteins coalesce by a liquid phase separation to form puncta at the bilayer. They also very nicely show how Arp2/3 and actin bind to these assemblies."

The phase separation is driven by the formation of the liquid droplet and the tails coming together in the bilayer is just a clustering process driven by binding to Nck in the fluid assembly. The process is a consequence of the 3-dimensional phase separation outside the bilayer. Therefore, the data say nothing about the involvement or lack of involvement of the lipids in the bilayer. The experiment is designed in such a way that it cannot be known how the trans-membrane nephrin molecule does its job in the slit diaphragm plasma membrane. We therefore feel that you need to restate the conclusions to justify publication in <i>eLife</i>."

The phase separation is driven by the formation of the liquid droplet and the tails coming together in the bilayer is just a clustering process driven by binding to Nck in the fluid assembly. The process is a consequence of the 3-dimensional phase separation outside the bilayer. Therefore, the data say nothing about the involvement or lack of involvement of the lipids in the bilayer. The experiment is designed in such a way that it cannot be known how the trans-membrane nephrin molecule does its job in the slit diaphragm plasma membrane.

First, for exactly the reasons stated above, we did not make any claims about the behavior of the lipids in our study. The phase separation we describe is of the p-Nephrin protein and its ligands, forming a 2D structure adjacent to the membrane. This is, in fact, one of the novel aspects of our work, that proteins alone can phase separate to create 2D structures on the membrane in the absence of lipid phase separation. The coupling between lipid phase separation and protein phase separation is an interesting topic of future research, but it is not addressed here. Second, the phase separation of the nephrin tails that we report here is occurring at Nck concentrations \u223c50-fold below those necessary for 3D droplet formation. So the process we are observing is not the formation of 3D droplets in solution, followed by binding of those droplets to membrane-attached p-Nephrin. Rather, the entire process is occurring in the 2D plane of the membrane (or more precisely, just above the membrane). We believe that the lower dimensionality of the membrane-attached system affords the lower critical concentration."

Most importantly, we have used the Nephrin/Nck/N-WASP system as a model to understand multivalent signaling assemblies in general. This is the greatest value of our work, describing assays, behaviors and properties that will be generalizable to many membrane-attached multivalent signaling systems, much more than providing specific insights into Nephrin function in the kidney. Nevertheless, we do feel that our work does, in fact, inform on some aspects of Nephrin\u2019s biological function. Nephrin clustering in podocytes will be controlled by at least three classes of interactions: extracellular, intramembrane and intracellular. As we describe in the Discussion section, these will all work cooperatively to drive clustering of Nephrin and its various ligands, including both proteins and lipids. Our work describes the intracellular interactions in quantitative detail, providing an initial framework that we will expand in the future to ultimately understand the full-length molecule. For these various reasons we feel our conclusions about phase separation of membrane-attached p-Nephrin are sound, but obviously need to be stated with greater clarity in the manuscript. We have made a number of changes to the Abstract and text to address these points."

Thus, as the referee suggests, the functional form of the size distribution can show at least two different behaviors, due to the variable contributions of nucleation/growth/coalescence rates to the clustering dynamics. Because of these complexities, we have refrained from interpreting these data, beyond demonstrating dynamics of the clusters. A full mechanistic description of the clustering dynamics would require a great deal more experimental data and also development of theory, and is beyond the scope of the present work."
