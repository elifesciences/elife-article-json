In mammalian cells, a protein called Hsf1 is activated by stress and regulates the activity of a large set of target genes. These genes code for proteins that help the cell cope with the effects of stress, for example, by repairing or breaking down damaged proteins. Under normal conditions, Hsf1 exists as a single molecule, but when it is activated, three molecules come together to make a complex called a trimer that is able to bind to DNA and activate the target genes."

The experiments showed that there are two regions of the Hsf1 protein that changed shape dramatically when the temperature increased. A region that regulates the activity of Hsf1 unfolded, while a region involved in making the trimer became more stable. Detailed analysis showed that once the regulatory region unfolded, the protein was able to interact with other Hsf1 units to make the trimer. Therefore, Hsf1 can directly sense and respond to changes in temperature without the aid of any chaperone proteins."

In addition, a chaperone protein called Hsp90 \u2013 which is known to be able to interact with Hsf1 \u2013 influenced how Hsf1 responded to changes in temperature. Hentze et al. also present a model for the activation of Hsf1 that allows for flexibility in the response of Hsf1 to changes in temperature. Previous studies have shown that Hsf1 is chemically modified during stress and also while the cell recovers from stressful conditions. Therefore, the next challenge will be to find out how these modifications influence the way in which Hsf1 responds to stress."

In all eukaryotic cells, heat shock transcription factor (HSF) 1 is the master regulator of this response and alters transcription of a large number of genes, some of which encode chaperones and proteases (<a href=\"#bib6\">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</a>). Although this response is essentially cell autonomous, systemic modulation of this response has been observed in metazoa (<a href=\"#bib38\">Morimoto, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Prahlad et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Prahlad and Morimoto, 2011</a>)."

In unstressed cells metazoan Hsf1 is monomeric and supposed to be in complex with molecular chaperones, including Hsp70, Hsp90 and TRiC/CCT (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zou et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Neef et al., 2014</a>). At physiological concentrations monomeric Hsf1 does not bind appreciably to heat shock elements (nGAAn). In the activated state Hsf1 forms trimers or higher order oligomers and binds to its response elements in heat shock gene promoters (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clos et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rabindran et al., 1993</a>). Currently, two models are discussed for the heat-induced activation of Hsf1: (1) Based on the observation that deletion or mutational alteration of HR-C leads to constitutive trimerization Wu and co-workers proposed that Hsf1 is a thermosensor itself and kept monomeric by intramolecular leucine zipper formation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rabindran et al., 1993</a>). However, activation of human Hsf1 in human and insect cells and <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes occurs at different temperatures, arguing against an Hsf1 intrinsic mechanism of heat shock activation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baler et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clos et al., 1993</a>). (2) Owing to the fact that the large variety of Hsf1-inducing signals have in common to cause protein misfolding and in analogy to the regulation of the heat shock response in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guisbert et al., 2008</a>), chaperones were proposed to prevent Hsf1 activation and to be titrated away from Hsf1 under stress conditions, resulting in heat shock response induction (<a href=\"#bib37\">Morimoto, 1998</a>). Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that inhibition of Hsp70, Hsp90 or TRiC/CCT or knock-down of their expression leads to the induction of the heat shock response (<a href=\"#bib44\">Powers and Workman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Powers et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Neef et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Whitesell et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abravaya et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zou et al., 1998</a>)."

At short incubation times the temperature response curve exhibits high cooperativity with a transition midpoint of 36\u00b0C. Using fluorescence anisotropy we demonstrate that the acquisition of DNA-binding competency depends on temperature and concentration of Hsf1. Phosphomimetic Hsf1 variants corresponding to phosphorylation at two serine residues previously shown to negatively affect Hsf1 activation did not have an increased temperature transition midpoint. Hsp90 known to negatively regulate Hsf1-mediated transcription decreased the slope of the temperature response curve, thereby lowering the transition midpoint and widening the response window. Our data suggest a kinetic model of Hsf1 trimerization."

As control, we analyzed the pre-treated Hsf1 by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wittig et al., 2006</a>) and observed a temperature-dependent increase in trimeric Hsf1 species (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The 10\u2009min-pre-incubation of Hsf1 dramatically changed conformational dynamics of two regions in Hsf1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>): temperature-dependent increase in HX is observed in HR-C, indicating heat-induced unfolding, and a concomitant decrease in HX is observed in HR-A/B, consistent with heat-induced trimerization. Close inspection of the spectra of the peptic fragments exhibiting temperature-induced changes in HX revealed bimodal distributions of the isotope clusters indicative of the coexistence of two populations of molecules with different exchange properties (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A and C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). An equation for two Gaussian curves was fitted to the intensity-versus-m/z plots of the data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and F</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B and D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and the equation parameters used to back calculate the contribution of each population to the peak intensities (see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). For the HR-A/B region the relative frequency of high exchanging population decreases with pre-incubation at increasing temperatures resulting in a sigmoidal temperature response curve (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). For the HR-C region the opposite is observed: the frequency of high exchanging species increased with increasing temperatures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). These data clearly demonstrate that Hsf1 has intrinsic thermosensory properties. The midpoint of transition T<sub>m</sub>, the temperature at which 50% of the molecules are in the high exchanging conformation after 10\u2009min, was identical for both regions equal to 36.15 \u00b1 0.14\u00b0C."

Under these prolonged incubation conditions, the transition curves became more shallow, and the midpoint temperature for HR-C unfolding and HR-A protection (trimerization) was not identical anymore but decreased to 32.0 \u00b1 0.4 and 34.7 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C, respectively. These data suggest that the temperature-induced conformational changes are not reversible under our conditions, otherwise the steepness of the curves, which is determined by the unfolding enthalpy, should remain the same as for the 10-min-pre-incubation. To investigate this in more detail we heat-shocked Hsf1 for 10\u2009min at 42\u00b0C, then incubated the protein for different time intervals at 20\u00b0C, and analyzed the conformational state by HX-MS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

                                "text": "In our in\u00a0vitro\u00a0experiments, the midpoint of trimerization of Hsf1 was around 36\u00b0C, which seemed rather low given a body core temperature of 37\u00b0C, and DNA binding activity of Hsf1 in different human cells is rather low below 40\u00b0C and strongly increased above 42\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abravaya et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mosser et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Baler et al., 1993</a>). In contrast, in testis the major increase in DNA binding activity of Hsf1 is already observed at 38\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sarge, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sarge et al., 1995</a>). Therefore, the above described unfolding of HR-C cannot be the sole determinant for the setpoint of Hsf1 trimerization and DNA binding activity. Trimerization as multi-molecular reaction would be intrinsically concentration dependent. In contrast, inhibition of trimerization by coiled-coil interaction of HR-C with HR-A/B, as originally proposed by Wu and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rabindran et al., 1993</a>), would be an intramolecular reaction and consequently independent of concentration. Thus, the concentration of Hsf1 could be an important parameter for controlling the setpoint of the temperature response curve. Consistent with this hypothesis we noticed spontaneous trimerization of Hsf1 even at 4\u00b0C upon concentrating the protein. To explore this hypothesis more quantitatively, we devised a fluorescence anisotropy assay to determine the fraction of Hsf1 capable of binding DNA after treatment at different temperatures. We treated different concentrations of Hsf1 at 30, 35, 37, 39, and 42\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, serially diluted the samples, incubated them with fluorescent labeled double-stranded DNA containing heat shock elements and measured fluorescence anisotropy (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). None of the formed Hsf1 trimers dissociated upon dilution and incubation at room temperature (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). If Hsf1 trimerization were not concentration dependent in the concentration range tested, all data points would fall onto the same titration curve. This was obviously not the case. The quadratic solution of the binding equilibrium, modified for fractional active protein was globally fitted to the data, assuming identical K<sub>D</sub> values for all formed Hsf1 trimers and similar minimum and maximum anisotropy values for no binding and complete binding, respectively. This fit yielded the fraction of DNA binding competent Hsf1 trimers. For 100 nM Hsf1, no activation was observed up to 42\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). At 300 nM, less than 20% of the theoretical possible Hsf1 trimers had formed at 42\u00b0C within 10\u2009min. In contrast, at 1 and 5 \u00b5M concentrations a substantial fraction of Hsf1 trimers had formed already at lower temperatures. At 42\u00b0C the apparent fraction of DNA-binding competent Hsf1 species may decrease due to the formation of high order oligomers as observed by blue native gel (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

In contrast, phosphorylation of the close-by Ser303 had no influence on Hsf1 activation (<a href=\"#bib69\">Xia et al., 1998</a>).

We are the first to show that the HR-C region of Hsf1 unfolds with temperature-dependent rates, resulting in a release of its repressive effect on Hsf1 trimerization and DNA binding. For relatively short heat shocks unfolding of HR-C and trimerization through intermolecular interactions of HR-A/B exhibit the same temperature response curves and follow identical kinetics, suggesting that these are coupled events. For longer heat shocks the cooperativity of the transition is reduced and HR-C unfolding and HR-A/B trimerization seem to uncouple. Most importantly, HR-C unfolding, temperature-induced trimerization and acquisition of DNA-binding competence depends on the concentration of Hsf1. Moreover, Hsp90 significantly modulated the temperature response of Hsf1, reducing midpoint and steepness of the response curve, thus widening the temperature window within which Hsf1 transits from monomer to trimer and low to maximal DNA binding competence. The response curves of Hsf1 in the presence of Hsp90 are similar to the response curves at prolonged incubation time at elevated temperatures. Thus, Hsp90 accelerates the response at intermediate heat shock conditions."

How can these differences be explained? Under our conditions temperature-induced Hsf1 transitions were irreversible. Therefore, at low temperatures even rare unfolding fluctuations of HR-C will eventually lead to trimerization, which will not be observed at short incubation times. Two effects could be responsible for the difference in T<sub>m</sub> for HR-A/B and HR-C. At low temperature HR-C dissociation from HR-A/B and re-association might be fast as compared to trimerization. In the free state, HR-C could exist in an unfolding-refolding equilibrium, allowing exchange of protons for deuterons. If refolding is slow in comparison to the intrinsic chemical exchange rate, this would be visible as unfolded species, but HR-C would still refold and reassociate with HR-A/B, repressing trimerization. With increasing temperature unfolding rates would increase, shifting the equilibrium to the completely unfolded state, then allowing HR-A/B trimerization. Alternatively, additional temperature-induced conformational changes in HR-A/B are necessary to allow trimerization and these changes are slow as compared to HR-C unfolding at low temperatures."

This observation seems to be at odds with the known repressive function of Hsp90 on the heat shock response (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zou et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Whitesell et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sittler et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Ali et al., 1998</a>). This discrepancy may have different reasons. First, Hsp90 also inhibits the heat shock response in yeast, although yeast Hsf1 is constitutively trimeric and bound to DNA, suggesting that Hsp90 could exert its inhibiting function on human Hsf1 after trimerization and DNA binding as well, consistent with observations for human Hsf1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Duina et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sorger et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Guo et al., 2001</a>). Second, in our experiments we only used one isoform of Hsp90, Hsp90\u03b2, and did not add any of the some 30 co-chaperones known to assist chaperoning by Hsp90. Further experiments with Hsp90\u03b1 and different combinations of co-chaperones will be necessary to elucidate whether there exist isoform specificity in Hsf1 regulation or whether Hsp90-co-chaperone complexes have a different effect on Hsf1 trimerization than Hsp90\u03b2 alone. Third, effects of Hsp90 down-regulation or inhibition could also be indirect, especially because interaction of Hsp90 with Hsf1 seems only to be observed after cross-linking (<a href=\"#bib40\">Neef et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zou et al., 1998</a>), suggesting a very transient interaction. Hsp90 chaperones many kinases, and inhibition of Hsp90 leads to inactivation and degradation of these client proteins. Loss of such kinases could reduce inhibitory effects of phosphorylation or phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation of Hsf1 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Soncin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hietakangas et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">2006</a>)."

Together with the observation that Hsf1 spontaneously trimerizes at high concentrations in the absence of a heat shock ([<a href=\"#bib76\">Zhong et al., 1998</a>] and our own observations) and with our HX-MS data, showing temperature-induced unfolding of HR-C, the model shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a> can be derived. Under non-stress conditions, HSF1 is in a conformational equilibrium between a closed conformation with HR-C interacting with HR-A/B and an open conformation, in which the two heptad repeat regions are dissociated. Since association of HR-C with HR-A/B is an intramolecular interaction, limiting the diffusional freedom of the interaction partners, association rates would be very high due to the apparent high local concentration. In addition, the net charge of HR-A/B and HR-C are +6 and -7, respectively, favoring association of the two regions by electrostatic attraction. Only at high concentrations of HSF1 association of HR-A/B regions of several HSF1 molecules, which are in the open conformation, would be able to compete with the intramolecular reaction, forming the thermodynamically more stable trimer. This would explain the spontaneous Hsf1 trimerization at high concentrations even at low temperatures (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zhong et al., 1998</a>). Temperature-induced unfolding of HR-C in the closed conformation favors HR-C dissociation. Alternatively or in addition, HR-C unfolding in the open conformation prevents coiled-coil interaction with HR-A/B and thus reduces the back-reaction to the closed conformation. As a consequence, trimer association is favored even at lower HSF1 concentrations."

In unstressed cells monomeric Hsf1 is in equilibrium between a closed, HR-C docked to HR-A/B, and open conformation, with HR-C dissociated from HR-A/B. Owing to high local concentration and electrostatic attraction the intramolecular association rate k<sub>on,i</sub> of the HR-C\u2013HR-A/B interaction are very high as compared to the dissociation rate k<sub>off,i</sub>. Since only uncomplexed HR-A/B can trimerize and Hsf1 trimerization therefore depends on the concentration of the open conformation, at low temperatures, trimerization only occurs at high Hsf1 concentrations. Temperature-induced unfolding of HR-C in the docked or undocked state reduces the intramolecular association rates and/or increases the dissociation rate of the intramolecular HR-C\u2013HR-A/B complex, thereby increasing the concentration of Hsf1 in the open conformation and allowing trimerization at low Hsf1 concentrations. (<b>B</b>) Dimer activation model. At low temperatures, HR-C is constitutively docked onto HR-A/B and monomeric Hsf1 transiently dimerizes through the free part of HR-A/B. Such transient dimerization may partially destabilize the HR-C\u2013HR-A/B interaction. At high Hsf1 concentrations a third Hsf1 monomer could interact with a transient Hsf1 dimer to form a thermodynamically stable Hsf1 trimer with completely released HR-C even at low temperatures. Increasing temperatures lead to unfolding of HR-C in the dimeric Hsf1 species leading to stabilization of the Hsf1 dimer and increased probability of trimerization. Hsp90 might modulate the temperature response by stabilizing the dimeric Hsf1 species. (<b>C</b>) Estimation of the concentration dependence of the transition temperature of Hsf1. Data points are all the T<sub>m</sub> values determined for 10 min incubation at elevated temperatures for Hsf1 wild type in the absence (black) or presence (green) of Hsp90 by HX-MS and by anisotropy. Black curve is a fit of the quadratic solution of the law of mass action of the monomer-dimer equilibrium, assuming that the fraction of dimer determines the T<sub>m</sub>. This fit results in a T<sub>m,M</sub> for the monomer of Hsf1 (extrapolation to 0 nM) of 53\u00b0C, the T<sub>m,D</sub> for the dimer of 33\u00b0C, and a K<sub>D</sub> of the monomer-dimer equilibrium of 330 nM. Due to the sensitivity of the fit to data points at low Hsf1 concentrations, these are only rough estimates. The blue and red dotted lines are simulations using a lower value for K<sub>D</sub> (100 nM, blue) or K<sub>D</sub> (200 nM) and T<sub>m,D</sub> (29\u00b0C, red) to simulate the effect of Hsp90.

In such a state, we would not expect to see much protection in HX-MS experiments, which is in contrast to our observation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The amount of heat necessary to unfold a single helix seems too small to account for the temperature control, the steepness, the kinetics and the substantial activation energy of 249 kJ\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup> for the unfolding/trimerization transition, observed in our experiments.

In this model HR-C remains bound to HR-A/B in the unstressed Hsf1 monomer. However, unstressed Hsf1 could transiently dimerize due to the larger size of the HR-A/B region (75 amino acids) as compared to HR-C (42 amino acids). Such dimers would be destabilized by the interaction of HR-C with HR-A/B, resulting in high dissociation rates and a high fraction of Hsf1 monomers in unstressed cells. However, HR-A/B-HR-A/B interaction could also destabilize the interaction of HR-C with HR-A/B. At high Hsf1 concentrations, association of a third Hsf1 monomer to the transient Hsf1 dimer could occur, displacing the then more-weakly bound HR-C and leading to a stable Hsf1 trimer. Heat-induced unfolding of HR-C and possibly also its binding partner within HR-A/B (in our experiments obscured by subsequent trimerization) would lead to HR-C undocking. This would reduce Hsf1 dimer dissociation rates and favor Hsf1 trimerization even at low Hsf1 concentrations."

Stabilization of the HR-A-HR-A dimer and concomitant destabilization of HR-A/B-HR-C interaction would automatically destabilize HR-C ,since single helices are not stabile in solution and only stabilized by interaction with other structural elements, leading to a reduced unfolding transition temperature. To distinguish between stabilization of HR-A-HR-A interaction and destabilization of HR-A/B-HR-C interactions we simulated the effect of Hsp90 on the T<sub>m</sub> by varying the apparent K<sub>D</sub> for dimerization and/or the T<sub>m,D</sub> of the dimer (see <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>, dotted lines). With the current data available only changing the K<sub>D</sub> does not reduce the T<sub>m</sub> sufficiently to fit the measured values. However, small changes in K<sub>D</sub> and T<sub>m,D</sub> would give satisfying results. This would also explain the observation that Hsp90 reduced the T<sub>m</sub> for HR-C unfolding significantly more than the T<sub>m</sub> for trimerization. In this respect Hsp90, curiously, had a similar effect as the prolonged incubation at elevated temperatures (compare transition curves in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E and G</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B, C, and F</a>). Thus, Hsp90 accelerates temperature-induced changes in conformation of Hsf1. It is not surprising that the chaperone Hsp90 destabilizes the HR-C conformation. Chaperones have been shown to locally unfold native proteins (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rodriguez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sharma et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kirschke et al., 2014</a>) and Hsp90 is believed to destabilize an \u03b1-helix in steroid hormone receptors to allow hormone binding."

According to our model Hsf1 exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, and trimerization of Hsf1 with subsequent DNA binding may occur continuously at low levels, promoted by Hsp90, as shown by us, and inhibited by TriC/CCT (<a href=\"#bib40\">Neef et al., 2014</a>). This may ensure basal Hsf1 transcriptional activity under non-stress conditions. At the same time inhibition of Hsf1 activity by Hsp90, Hsp70-mediated attenuation and continuous Hsf1 monomerization would keep heat\u00a0shock gene transcription at a low level. Any condition that would favor Hsf1 dimerization and thus trimerization or inhibit chaperone-mediated inhibition or attenuation would, as a consequence, increase heat shock gene transcription. All of the conditions mentioned above, including development, have been associated with an imbalance in proteostasis affecting Hsf1 through titrating away chaperones. However, Hsf1 dimerization could also be affected directly by changing its local concentration, as through transport of Hsf1 into the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dai et al., 2003</a>) or preventing its export (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vujanac et al., 2005</a>), and by posttranslational modifications, including glutathionylation of the cysteine in HR-A in response to oxidative stress or alkylating agents (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 1996</a>), and phosphorylation of Thr142 in HR-A (<a href=\"#bib59\">Soncin et al., 2003</a>), both of which would reduce the positive net charge of HR-A and thus the electrostatic repulsion."

In transient or stable transfection experiments, usually a strong promoter is used to express the transfected gene. Thus, the concentration of Hsf1 might have been much higher in the transfected cell than is naturally the case in human cells. Similarly, in <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte-injection experiments the amount of injected mRNA determines the final concentration of HSF1 and might have been so high that the resulting Hsf1 concentration might have allowed activation already at 37\u00b0C. Finally, our kinetic Hsf1 activation model would allow each cell to adjust its setpoint of activation by changing the concentration of Hsf1 by producing more Hsf1 or by concentrating it in a smaller compartment, for example by transport from the cytoplasm into the nucleus.

Its key conclusion is that a temperature-induced change in the folded state of domain HR-C set in motion a chain of events that culminates in trimerisation and DNA binding. Thereby establishing a direct thermal sensing by HSF1 in its activation. Quantification of the temperature-dependence and concentration-dependence of changes in the folded state of HR-C and HR-AB provides fodder for plausible modeling of the effects of HSF1 concentration on its temperature-dependent activation profile (i.e. the driver of the heatshock response in mammals) and uncovered a surprising effect of Hsp90 on this dynamic process."

The dogma in the field has been for long that the monomeric HSF-1 is kept inactive by chaperones (HSP90 and more recently also TRiC) until a proteotoxic stress occurs that titrates these chaperones to misfolded proteins, allowing HSF-1 to form trimers, the required step for it to activate the heat shock response (HSR). Even though generally cited, this model \u2013 or at least the generality of it \u2013 has been repeatedly questioned and the negative regulation by Hsp90 might likely be indirect. In this paper, direct evidence is provided that HSF1 itself undergoes heat-induced conformational changes that would suffice to explain heat-induced HSF1 activation, confirming earlier suggestions that HSF-1 in fact acts as the thermosensor."

Next, they show that HSF-1 concentration is an important parameter for the trimerization as well as for the DNA-binding competence of the trimer, which would be consistent with the possibility that HSF1 activation is different between species and cell types through adjustment of HSF-1 concentration."

The finding that Hsp90 is not inhibiting trimerization is the most surprising finding and challenges a long-lived dogma in the field.

They use an elegant biophysical approach (hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HX-MS)) to delineate the polypeptide areas of HSF1 that are sensitive to temperature changes. Their work identifies a region that unfolds with temperature (HSF1 regulatory region) and an area that concomitantly tightens (trimerization region). The relative structural transitions in these regions in response to temperature are relatively sharp especially compared to the behavior in the presence of Hsp90, which broadens the structural transitions. In addition, the authors present data suggesting phosphorylation might also impact the responsiveness of HSF1 to temperature. In considering the work for publication the following points should be weighed:"

These issues were singled out for your attention because they are deemed to affect the strength of the papers conclusions: 1) Most of the experiments are based on H/D exchange. They reveal changes in local dynamics and accessibility depending on temperature variation. It is reasonable to assume that the defined changes identified by the authors are the critical changes that promote trimerization. However, as a proof of principle one would like to see an assay that reports directly on quaternary structure performed in parallel to some of the H/D experiments.

As explained in a letter to the editor, extending our study performed with Hsp90 to another chaperone (e.g. Hsp70), is much more complex than the reviewers seem to realize. First, addition of another protein in HX-MS experiments requires a new establishment of the analysis. Since the chaperone is added in several fold excess and, depending on the digestion efficiency of the chaperone itself, peptides will overlap with Hsf1 peptides, the liquid chromatography gradient has to be adjusted to be able to separate the relevant peptides. Second, to give meaningful results Hsp70 should not be used alone but should be used in combination with one of the some 16 J-domain co-chaperones predicted to be present in the cytosol of human cells and maybe one of the seven nucleotide exchange factors. At present we have no idea which of the J-domain proteins and which of the nucleotide exchange factors is relevant for Hsf1 regulation. Also, should the heat-inducible Hsp70 or the constitutive Hsc70 be used in such a study? We think this is a completely new study that will be interesting but in our opinion goes far beyond the current manuscript. Besides, Hsp70 was shown not to affect activation of Hsf1 but attenuation (Rabindran et al. 1994 Mol Cell. Biol). I am not sure how such a study would impact our results with Hsp90. If Hsp70 has a similar effect or not, will not substantiate our findings with Hsp90."

The global fit was necessary since, as the reviewers observe correctly, at some temperatures not enough trimeric Hsf1 is generated to saturate DNA-binding and reach the upper limit of the anisotropy values and therefore the upper limit is not defined for these temperatures. Fitting the data individually would not yield a K<sub>D</sub> or upper limit.

To our knowledge all described variants of Hsf1 that do not trimerize anymore have a deleted HR-A and/or HR-B (Zuo et al. 1994) and as such would not be useful for the suggested experiment. Based on published data on Hsf1-deletion mutants (Zuo et al. 1994) and our HX-MS results showing strong protection in HR-B, suggesting interaction of HR-C with HR-B, we tried to construct a suitable mutant by exchanging hydrophobic residues of the heptad repeat region A, which was proposed to be responsible for the formation of a trimeric coiled-coil and was shown recently to form the trimer interface, by serine. In HX-MS experiments both regions, HR-A and HR-C, were completely exchanged after 10 min pre-incubation at all temperatures tested, indicating that the mutated residues are necessary for the interaction of HR-A with HR-C and for trimerization."

The idea that the HR-C motif is crucial to HSF-1 trimerization and DNA binding (via intramolecular interactions with the HR-A/B domain) is not novel as also very correctly cited by the authors themselves. But, especially for the human HSF-1, the finding that it is the temperature sensing domain was never directly demonstrated before. The finding that Hsp90 is not inhibiting trimerization is the most surprising finding and challenges a long-lived dogma in the field. As stated again correctly by the authors themselves, it cannot be excluded that in vivo co-chaperones may still play a role, but this will have now to be shown in separate studies. My question/comments that the authors may wish to consider are: 1) Whereas the data clearly demonstrate that Hsp90 (alone) does not negatively regulate HSF-1, I am somewhat puzzled the fin dings that HSP90 lowers the threshold temperature for HR-C unfolding. Also in both models presented in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, this does not become clear. Whilst in the dimer activation model, the effects of HSP90 on HR-A/B might be explained by assuming stabilization of the intermediate dimer, I do not understand how such would explain effects on HR-C unfolding. I further would like to add that I find <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and the related explanation (Discussion, fourth paragraph) not very clear in general.</i> "

Given the novelty of this concept, in vivo data correlating with the in vitro work should be presented. For example, is HSF1 much more abundant in testis where its activation temperature is lower relative to other tissue types? Do all tissues with high levels of HSF1 display lower HSF1 activation responses? In addition, how do the shown concentrations of HSF1 compare to in vivo levels in any tissue type under normal or disease states? Changes in HSF1 concentrations in cancer cells would be especially interesting in light of the recent reports from the Lindquist laboratory showing constitutively active HSF1 in cancer cells.</i> "

The concentration of Hsf1 in testis has not been determined nor in any other tissue. The only values that we could find are a relative quantification of the complete proteome of 11 cancer cell lines performed by mass spectrometry in the Mann laboratory (Geiger et al. 2012). From these values we were able to calculate the fraction that Hsf1 makes up relative to all proteins detected. However, the value for cellular protein concentration is not trivial to determine, because for this one needs the volume of the cells. In many reviews values of 200 to 300 mg/ml are given, most of the time without any reference and if a reference is given, then it is another review without reference. We screened the literature extensively and found for HEK293 and Jurkat cells a protein concentration of 154 and 127 mg/ml (Gillen and Forbush 1999; Fumarolo et al. 2005). In the revised manuscript we include now some estimations of Hsf1 concentration in mammalian cells based on these values. However, Hsf1 is not evenly distributed in the cells but shuttles in and out of the nucleus (Vujanec et al. 2005). It becomes clear that what this reviewer asks is not trivial and requires a careful study to come to trustworthy conclusions. We will try to address this question in the future."

However, this is not as trivial as the reviewer might think and involves a completely new study. First, addition of another protein in HX-MS experiments requires a new establishment of the analysis. Since the chaperone is added in several fold excess and, depending on the digestion efficiency of the chaperone, peptides will overlap with Hsf1 peptides, the liquid chromatography gradient has to be adjusted to be able to separate the relevant peptides. Second, Hsp70 cannot be used alone but should be used in combination with one of the some 16 J-domain co-chaperones predicted to be present in the cytosol of human cells and maybe one of the seven-nucleotide exchange factors. At present we have no idea which of the J-domain protein and which of the nucleotide exchange factor is relevant for Hsf1 regulation. Also, should the heat inducible Hsp70 or the constitutive Hsc70 be used in such a study. This is a completely new study. Besides, Hsp70 was shown not to affect activation of Hsf1 but attenuation (Rabindran et al., 1994 Mol Cell. Biol)."
