Here we used stable isotope labeling and isotopomer analysis to trace sterol flux through the two pathways in mice. Surprisingly, no tissue used the canonical K\u2013R pathway. Rather, a hybrid pathway was identified that we call the modified K\u2013R (MK\u2013R) pathway. Proportional flux through the Bloch pathway varied from 8% in preputial gland to 97% in testes, and the tissue-specificity observed in vivo was retained in cultured cells. The distribution of sterol isotopomers in plasma mirrored that of liver. Sterol depletion in cultured cells increased flux through the Bloch pathway, whereas overexpression of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) enhanced usage of the MK\u2013R pathway. Thus, relative use of the Bloch and MK\u2013R pathways is highly variable, tissue-specific, flux dependent, and epigenetically fixed. Maintenance of two interdigitated pathways permits production of diverse bioactive sterols that can be regulated independently of cholesterol."

Here we used stable isotope labeling and isotopomer analysis to trace sterol flux through the two pathways in mice. Surprisingly, no tissue used the canonical K\u2013R pathway. Rather, a hybrid pathway was identified that we call the modified K\u2013R (MK\u2013R) pathway. Proportional flux through the Bloch pathway varied from 8% in preputial gland to 97% in testes, and the tissue-specificity observed in vivo was retained in cultured cells. The distribution of sterol isotopomers in plasma mirrored that of liver. Sterol depletion in cultured cells increased flux through the Bloch pathway, whereas overexpression of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) enhanced usage of the MK\u2013R pathway. Thus, relative use of the Bloch and MK\u2013R pathways is highly variable, tissue-specific, flux dependent, and epigenetically fixed. Maintenance of two interdigitated pathways permits production of diverse bioactive sterols that can be regulated independently of cholesterol."

Rather, some of the cells used a hybrid pathway where the production of cholesterol was started using the Bloch pathway and then after a certain number of steps, the process switched to using part of the Kandutsch\u2013Russell pathway.

In contrast, the skin and brain use the modified Kandutsch\u2013Russell pathway. In some tissues, a fraction of the building blocks that can be used to make cholesterol were instead diverted to make other products. This suggests that animals have maintained the two pathways over the course of evolution to enable them to generate a variety of products, which can be used to carry out different biological processes. One challenge following this work will be to use the newly developed methods to analyze other complex biochemical pathways."

The molecule is synthesized entirely from acetate through a complex series of over 30 enzymatic reactions that are clustered into four major processes: condensation of acetate to isoprene, polymerization of isoprene to squalene, cyclization of squalene to lanosterol, and finally the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

The two pathways use the same catalytic steps and are distinguished by the stage at which the double bond at C24 in the side chain is reduced. <a href=\"#bib3\">Bloch et al. (1965)</a> proposed that reduction of the double bond in the side chain (\u039424) is the last reaction in the pathway (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, black arrows). Thus, in the Bloch pathway, cholesterol synthesis proceeds via a series of side-chain unsaturated intermediates to desmosterol, which is reduced by DHCR24 to cholesterol. Subsequently, Kandutsch and Russell (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kandutsch and Russell, 1960a</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">1960b</a>) reported that the preputial glands of mice synthesized dihydrolanosterol and other side-chain saturated intermediates that were different from those in the Bloch pathway. They proposed an alternative pathway, the Kandutsch\u2013Russell (K\u2013R) pathway, in which the \u039424 bond of lanosterol is reduced and the conversion of dihydrolanosterol to cholesterol proceeds via 7-dehydrocholesterol (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, red arrows) using the same enzymes as the Bloch pathway. Later studies showed the presence of saturated side chain intermediates in brain, skin, and eventually in all tissues examined (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schroepfer, 1982</a>). The catalytic mechanisms and regulation of the enzymes that catalyze the Bloch and K\u2013R pathways have been extensively investigated but much less is known about their relative use and physiological significance. Cholesterol biosynthesis is usually measured using radioisotope methods (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dietschy and Spady, 1984</a>) that are highly sensitive but do not provide information about the turnover of intermediate sterols in the biosynthetic pathway. Flux through the Bloch and K\u2013R pathways has not been systematically studied in cultured cells or in vivo. Therefore, the relative use of the two pathways and their responses to changes in cholesterol availability are not known. The reason why both pathways have been maintained is also not known. The biosynthetic intermediates of the two pathways have powerful, but distinct, effects on cholesterol homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib38\">Yang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lange et al., 2008</a>), fatty acid synthesis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Spann et al., 2012</a>), and inflammation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Spann et al., 2012</a>). Varying the concentrations of specific cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates by differential use of the Bloch and K\u2013R pathways may thus contribute to regulation of diverse cellular processes."

More recently, <a href=\"#bib25\">McDonald et al. (2012)</a> developed a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to determine steady-state concentrations of most of post squalene cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates of the Bloch and K\u2013R pathways in biological fluids.

In the unlabeled sample, the fraction abundance of M = 0 is 0.74 (we will call this M0<sub>n</sub>); for the labeled sample, it is 0.23 (M0<sub>t</sub>). If we sample a sterol as the pool is turning over, the fractional abundance of M = 0 (M0<sub>m</sub>) will decrease from 0.74 to 0.23. The corresponding values of M2<sub>m</sub> will increase from 0.04 to 0.29. Using this data, the fraction of molecules that are newly synthesized (g) can be estimated using isotopic spectral analysis (IA). Using IA, the value of M0<sub>m</sub> has two components: (1) M0<sub>n</sub> times the fraction of molecules not labeled (1 \u2212 g). (2) M0<sub>t</sub> times the fraction of molecules newly synthesized (g). These two values can be summed to get the value of M0<sub>m</sub>. This same analysis can be done for any of the peaks. Then, by solving for g, the fraction of molecules newly synthesized can be determined based on M0<sub>m</sub>, M0<sub>n</sub>, and M0<sub>t</sub>. M0<sub>m</sub> is the measured value that is obtained from MS. M0<sub>n</sub> is determined from an unlabeled sample or from a natural abundance calculator. M0<sub>t</sub> can be determined from samples exposed to label long enough to ensure turnover of the entire pool, or using mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hellerstein and Neese, 1999</a>). The biosynthetic rate was calculated by fitting the relationship between g and time to a first-order kinetic model.

The methylated biosynthetic intermediates between lanosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol in the K\u2013R pathway (i.e., dihydrolanosterol, dihydro-ff-MAS, and dihydro-t-MAS) did not turnover at comparable rates to either lanosterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol, suggesting that the classical K\u2013R pathway was not used to synthesize cholesterol in these cells. Instead, the cells used a hybrid pathway that we will refer to as the modified Kandutsch\u2013Russell (MK\u2013R) pathway.

In WT CHO-7 cells, the Bloch pathway accounted for \u223c90% of cholesterol synthesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Deletion of SCAP reduced lanosterol biosynthesis by 80%, with similar reductions in the biosynthesis of other unsaturated side chain Bloch intermediates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Despite the massive reduction in net sterol synthesis in the SRD13A cells, the biosynthetic rate of 7-dehydrocholesterol was similar to that observed in the parental cell line (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, inset).

Essentially all of the increase occurred via the Bloch pathway: flux through the MK\u2013R pathway did not change (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, open bars). Therefore, cholesterol depletion shifted the relative utilization of the two pathways such that approximately equal amounts of lanosterol were metabolized via Bloch and MK\u2013R intermediates. Cholesterol depletion also resulted in the incorporation of a small amount of deuterium into dihydrolanosterol, presumably reflecting conversion from lanosterol, but none of the other K\u2013R intermediates prior to 7-dehydrocholesterol were labeled in these cells."

Despite a significant increase in Bloch pathway utilization in the cells that were grown in NCLPPS, no corresponding changes were observed in expression of the post-squalene cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes, including DHCR24. Thus, the increase in flux through the Bloch pathway cannot be attributed simply to changes in the expression of SREBP-2 and the coordinated transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding enzymes in the pathway. Next, we examined the relationship between the level of expression of DHCR24, which desaturates the side-chain of the sterol, and the relative use of the Bloch and MK\u2013R pathways."

The present study represents the first systematic analysis of flux through these pathways in cell culture and in vivo<i>.</i> The major finding of the study is that the architecture of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway shows striking differences among tissues. The testes and adrenal gland utilize the canonical Bloch pathway (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bloch, 1965</a>) almost exclusively (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, black arrows). None of the tissues examined in this study had a pattern of sterol turnover consistent with the reaction sequence proposed by <a href=\"#bib16\">Kandutsch and Russell (1960b)</a> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, red arrows). A hybrid pathway that we have named the MK\u2013R pathway exists in skin, preputial glands and brain, (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, red arrows). In these tissues, sterols undergo demethylation prior to side chain saturation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Whereas we were not able to localize the specific DHCR24 substrate in the D<sub>2</sub>O labeling studies, experiments using deuterium-labeled lanosterol and zymosterol in HEK-293 cells confirmed that zymosterol is the first sterol to undergo appreciable side-chain reduction, at least in these cells. Remarkably, immortalized cells in culture retained the specific pathways used by their tissues of origin. Regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis was achieved almost exclusively by changes in flux through the Bloch pathway. Our study reveals a strikingly varied pattern of sterol synthesis from lanosterol that allows for the generation of multiple, tissue-specific end-products in addition to cholesterol."

Those authors hypothesized that the physiological pathway for conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol did not correspond to either the Bloch or the KR pathways, but rather to a reaction sequence in which C24-reduction occurred after demethylation but before the final \u03945-dehydrogenation and \u03947-reduction of the sterol nucleus. This proposal was not assessed in vivo and did not gain wide acceptance. The present data provide in vivo evidence for 24-reduction of zymosterol, but the predominance of the Bloch pathway in most tissues with high rates of cholesterol synthesis indicates that desmosterol is a major physiological substrate for the enzyme."

These findings suggest that the MK\u2013R pathway is constitutively active and that the Bloch pathway is used preferentially for regulated cholesterol biosynthesis in response to fluctuations in cholesterol availability and demand. Upregulation of the Bloch pathway also increases the synthesis of regulatory sterols that limit cholesterol accumulation in the cells: desmosterol activates LXR, which promotes cholesterol efflux from cells, and acts as a feedback inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis by inactivating SREBP (<a href=\"#bib38\">Yang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Spann et al., 2012</a>)."

In the adrenal glands, lanosterol was quantitatively converted to desmosterol, and then presumably to cholesterol, which provides the substrate for adrenal steroidogenesis. In contrast, only one-third of the lanosterol synthesized in the testes was converted to desmosterol, and virtually none entered the MK\u2013R pathway. In this tissue, lanosterol was quantitatively converted to ff-MAS and then to t-MAS, but more than two-thirds of the t-MAS was diverted from the pathway before zymosterol (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The metabolic fate of t-MAS in the testes is not known. t-MAS and its immediate precursor ff-MAS have been implicated as meiosis-activating sterols in the formation of male and female germ cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Byskov et al., 1995</a>); however, the role of these precursor sterols remains controversial. Germ-cell specific ablation of <i>Cyp51a1,</i> the enzyme that converts lanosterol to ff-MAS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), markedly reduced testicular t-MAS concentration but had no effect on reproductive function in male mice (<a href=\"#bib17\">Keber et al., 2013</a>). The reduction in flux from t-MAS to zymosterol that we observed in mouse testes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) may be due to t-MAS being converted to another sterol (or steroid hormone), or to the secretion of t-MAS from the testes."

It is possible that dihydrolanosterol is rapidly excreted from the liver via the bile. Although we did not include biliary sterols in our flux studies, we have found that the concentration of dihydrolanosterol in bile is not enriched relative to the liver (data not shown). This finding is not compatible with selective biliary excretion of dihydrolanosterol.

Why the MK\u2013R is the predominant pathway in preputial gland is less clear. The major function of this gland is thought to be the synthesis of pheromones. The chemical nature of these pheromones has not been fully defined but squalene and cholesterol were the most abundant lipids identified in a GC/MS analysis of preputial glands from male rats (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Thus, cholesterol, or one or more of its biosynthetic precursors may be used for pheromone synthesis. In the present study, a loss of sterol between lanosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol was not observed, but we cannot exclude the possibility that some 7-dehydrocholesterol is diverted from cholesterol synthesis to pheromone synthesis."

DHCR24 is phosphorylated at multiple sites and may be regulated at the post-translational level (<a href=\"#bib23\">Luu et al., 2014</a>). The activity and substrate specificity of the enzyme may also be influenced by its intracellular location. Brown and his colleagues reported that DHCR7 and DHCR24 co-immunoprecipitate in CHO-7 cells (<a href=\"#bib24a\">Luu et al., 2015</a>). Those authors proposed that the formation of a complex between the two proteins favors the efficient conversion of 7-dehydrodesmosterol to desmosterol, and then to cholesterol. This hypothesis is consistent with our finding that the Bloch pathway is predominantly used in steroidogenic cells. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanistic basis for the wide differences in DHCR24 expression among tissues, and to identify other factors that govern the route of flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathways."

The route by which cholesterol is transported from the peripheral tissues to the liver, a process termed reverse cholesterol transport (<a href=\"#bib9\">Glomset, 1968</a>), remains to be fully defined (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hellerstein and Turner, 2014</a>) One possibility is that peripheral tissues release cholesterol, but not the biosynthetic precursor sterols, into the circulation. In this case we would fail to capture flux of peripheral tissue cholesterol since we did not measure cholesterol isotopomers in these experiments. An alternative possibility is that cholesterol from the periphery is transported in the circulation by cells rather than lipoproteins or other plasma components. Careful quantification of cholesterol fluxes in vivo will be required to elucidate the relative contributions of cellular and plasma elements to the centripetal transport of peripheral tissue cholesterol."

This problem would be particularly acute if a small pool of intermediate turns over rapidly while a second, larger pool sequestered from the biosynthesis pathway turned over slowly. Under these conditions the larger pool may significantly reduce the labeling of the total intermediate isolated from the cells resulting in falsely low estimates of flux. The observation that multiple independent intermediates showed essentially identical kinetics argues against this possibility, but we cannot formally exclude it."

These determinations are almost invariably qualitative in nature. Second, flux through the pathway is quantified using radioisotopes to trace the turnover of a single metabolite, typically the end product of the pathway. By combining LC-MS/MS methods with stable isotope tracing, flux can be monitored through multiple intermediates in a biosynthetic pathway simultaneously. As illustrated in the present study, this approach can reveal bifurcations in established pathways that imply novel biochemistry and physiology for molecules previously viewed simply as biosynthetic intermediates."

The value of N for all sterols was then calculated based on the asymptotic value of M0<sub>t</sub>. The value of N ranged from 20 to 28 in all tissues."

Was there evidence for this? Can one perturb pathway utilization with low doses of squalene synthase inhibitors? Please elaborate on your thoughts about what is controlling pathway utilization."

Could you quantify the amount of 7-Dehydrocholesterol that is shunted away into oxidized derivatives? Does different pathway utilization in different tissues explain the susceptibility of different tissues to disease? Such studies are almost certainly too much for this paper, but the authors should at least put forward a more detailed description of what they consider to be the most important biochemical factors that govern pathway utilization of the two different pathways in different cell lines and tissues."

The comment in Wikipedia appears to have its origin in a paper by Bae and Paik (Bae and Paik, Biochem J 326:609, 1997), who reported that zymosterol was preferred over lanosterol as a substrate for C-24 reduction in rat liver microsomes. Those authors hypothesized that the physiological pathway for conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol did not correspond to either the Bloch or the KR pathways, but rather to a reaction sequence in which C24-reduction occurred after demethylation but before the final \u0394<sup>5</sup>-dehydrogenation and \u0394<sup>7</sup>-reduction of the sterol nucleus. This proposal was not assessed in vivo and did not gain wide acceptance. Subsequently, Gaylor et al. noted the enzymes in the pathway act on sterols with both unsaturated and saturated side chains and so crossover between the Bloch and Kandutsch-Russell pathways could potentially occur at any point in the pathway (Gaylor J, BBRC 295:1139, 2002). The interpretation was challenged by Brown and his colleagues (Zerenturk et al. Prog Lipid Res 52:666, 2013) since desmosterol, not zymosterol, accumulates in DHCR24 deficiency.
