Spontaneously oscillating electroreceptors in weakly electric fish (Mormyridae) respond to electrosensory stimuli with a phase reset that results in transient synchrony across the receptor population (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2015</a>). Here, we asked whether the central electrosensory system actually detects the occurrence of synchronous oscillations among receptors. We found that electrosensory stimulation elicited evoked potentials in the midbrain exterolateral nucleus at a short latency following receptor synchronization. Frequency tuning in the midbrain resembled peripheral frequency tuning, which matches the intrinsic oscillation frequencies of the receptors. These frequencies are lower than those in individual conspecific signals, and instead match those found in collective signals produced by groups of conspecifics. Our results provide further support for a novel mechanism for sensory coding based on the detection of oscillatory synchrony among peripheral receptors."

The ability to detect subtle variations in EOD waveform evolved independently in two mormyrid lineages (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carlson et al., 2011</a>). One lineage belongs to the subfamily Mormyrinae, is known as 'clade A', and includes over 175 species (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carlson and Arnegard, 2011</a>). The other lineage has only one known extant species, <i>Petrocephalus microphthalmus</i>, and belongs to the subfamily Petrocephalinae. All other petrocephaline species studied so far are unable to detect subtle variations in EOD waveform (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carlson et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, the perceptual ability to detect signal variation is associated with parallel evolutionary changes in the peripheral and central electrosensory system (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carlson et al., 2011</a>)."

These receptors fire spontaneous spikes and respond to EODs with a single time-locked spike (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, knollenorgans are limited to three rosettes on each side of the head in species that are unable to detect variation in EOD waveform (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carlson et al., 2011</a>). Receptors in species unable to detect EOD waveform variation produce spontaneously oscillating potentials at frequencies between 1 and 3 kHz. Spontaneous oscillations across these receptors are uncorrelated (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, however, these oscillating receptors respond to electrosensory stimulation with an increase in the amplitude of oscillations and with a phase reset that causes the oscillations across receptors to transiently synchronize (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2015</a>). Here, we build upon this finding by asking whether this transient oscillatory synchrony across receptors is detected by the central electrosensory system."

In species unable to detect EOD waveform variation, the midbrain exterolateral nucleus (EL) is small and undifferentiated. In clade A and <i>P. microphthalmus</i>, however, the EL is enlarged and divided into separate anterior (ELa) and posterior (ELp) regions. Our current understanding of signal processing in EL is limited to studies on a few clade-A species (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib6\">Baker et al., 2013</a>). Briefly, spiking receptors on the surface of the skin project to the ipsilateral nucleus of the electrosensory lateral line lobe (nELL) in the hindbrain (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bell and Grant, 1989</a>). The nELL relays electrosensory information bilaterally to ELa. The axons of nELL cells synapse onto two types of cells in ELa: small cells and large cells. Small cells in ELa perform the first stages of EOD waveform analysis in a circuit that includes direct inhibition from large cells and excitation from nELL cells with axonal projections that vary in length. These axonal projections serve as delay lines and establish differences in the relative timing between inhibitory and excitatory input, allowing small cells to process submillisecond time differences based on an anti-coincidence detection mechanism (<a href=\"#bib19\">Friedman and Hopkins, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lyons-Warren et al., 2013a</a>). Small cells in ELa then project to ELp, in which multipolar cells perform the first stages of inter-pulse interval analysis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Carlson, 2009</a>). How the central electrosensory systems of <i>P. microphthalmus</i> and species with a small and undifferentiated EL process communication signals is still an open question."

To conclusively demonstrate that the central electrosensory system detects this transient synchrony, an experiment manipulating only the degree of synchrony across the population of receptors, independent of the stimulus, is necessary. However, there is evidence to suggest that the electrosensory system indeed detects transient oscillatory synchrony. Oscillatory receptors synchronize at latencies of ~0.2 ms following stimulus onset and rapidly desynchronize due to differences across receptors in their intrinsic oscillation frequencies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2015</a>). The relative latencies between receptor synchronization and midbrain evoked potentials is comparable to the relative latencies between receptor spiking and midbrain evoked potentials previously reported in species with spiking receptors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amagai, 1998</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib1\">Amagai et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Friedman and Hopkins, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lyons-Warren et al., 2013a</a>). In fact, the range of latencies of evoked potentials in the EL of <i>P. tenuicauda</i> spans the range of latencies recorded in the ELa and ELp of both <i>P. microphthalmus</i> and <i>B. niger</i>. Further, the amplitudes of both spontaneous and stimulus-evoked oscillations vary widely across the population of receptors, whereas the phase reset is highly consistent for sufficiently strong stimuli (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2015</a>). Thus, synchrony across receptors resulting from stimulus-induced phase resets is the only known peripheral event that reliably, and exclusively, precedes the evoked potential responses we observed in EL."

Such coincidence detection would have to take place before EL, in either of two possible locations along the ascending electrosensory pathway: the primary afferents or the nELL of the hindbrain. Primary afferents could detect synchrony if they innervate several knollenorgans, whereas nELL cells could detect synchrony if they receive input from multiple afferents. Previous studies have shown that individual afferent fibers do not project to multiple knollenorgans in species with oscillating receptors (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harder, 1968</a>). Further, nELL neurons in clade-A species with spiking receptors have anatomical features typical of coincidence detectors (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ashida et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bell et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kuba et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mugnaini and Maler, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Szabo and Ravaille, 1976</a>), and they receive convergent input from multiple primary afferents (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bell and Grant, 1989</a>). These results suggest that coincidence detection in species with oscillatory receptors could take place in the nELL.

The electrosensory system of species with spiking receptors is tuned to the frequency content of conspecific EODs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bass and Hopkins, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hopkins and Bass, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hopkins, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lyons-Warren et al., 2012</a>). In species with oscillating receptors, however, peripheral and central frequency sensitivity match the intrinsic oscillations of the receptors (1\u20133 kHz), which are much lower than the frequency content of conspecific EODs (~9\u00a0kHz) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2015</a>; this study). Instead, the electrosensory system of species with oscillating receptors appears to be tuned to properties of the collective signals produced by groups of conspecific individuals (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2015</a>). Field and laboratory observations indicate that many species with oscillating receptors form shoals in open water (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hopkins, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lavou\u00e9 et al., 2004</a>).

Indeed, we have recently shown that a species with spiking receptors shows social competition, whereas a sympatric species with oscillating receptors shows social affiliation, both in the field and laboratory settings (<a href=\"#bib16\">Carlson, 2016</a>). Thus, differences in the physiological properties of the electrosensory system likely reflect adaptations for different social environments across mormyrids. However<i>, P. microphthalmus</i> is an interesting exception in that frequency sensitivity matches the frequency content of individual EODs, but they form shoals in the laboratory and in natural settings (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lavou\u00e9 et al., 2004</a>)."

At low intensities, evoked potentials were relatively stronger in <i>P. tenuicauda</i> than in <i>P. microphthalmus</i> and <i>B. niger</i>. These results suggest that the peripheral electrosensory system is more sensitive in species with oscillating receptors than in species with spiking receptors. The enhanced sensitivity in <i>P. tenuicauda</i> may be a property of a network of resonating oscillators: weak signals are more efficiently detected and amplified by a coherent summation of oscillators (<a href=\"#bib11\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Draguhn, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kandel and Buzs\u00e1ki, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Steriade and Timofeev, 2003</a>). Furthermore, stimulus intensity could be analyzed by the electrosensory system using a synchrony code. In <i>P. tenuicauda</i>, the small changes in the amplitude of evoked potentials as a function of stimulus intensity suggests little differences in the amount of synchrony across oscillating receptors in the range of stimulus levels tested. Future comparative studies should investigate the effect of stimulus intensity on synchrony level across electroreceptors and whether the differences in sensitivity reported here relate to perceptual differences between species with spiking and oscillating receptors."

After surgery, we brought the fish out of anesthesia by switching to aerated fresh water respiration and monitored the fish's electromotor output with a pair of electrodes placed next to the fish's tail (<a href=\"#bib14\">Carlson, 2002</a>). While flaxedil silences the EOD, a pair of external electrodes placed next to the tail can record EOD commands from spinal electromotor neurons. These EOD commands were amplified 1000x (Model 1700, A-M Systems) and sent to a window discriminator for time-stamping (SYS-121, World Precision Instruments)."

Recordings of evoked potentials were obtained after the fish had completely recovered from anesthesia. Evoked potentials were amplified 1000x and band-pass filtered (0.01\u20135 kHz) with a differential AC amplifier (A-M systems, Model 1700), digitized at a rate of 97.6 kHz (Tucker Davis, Model RX 8), and saved using custom software in Matlab. We recorded responses to 10 repetitions of each type of stimulus. Evoked potentials are blocked during a short period of time after the EOD command (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Therefore, in response to natural EODs and stimuli used to determine EL frequency tuning (see below), repetitions in which the fish emitted a command two to five ms before the stimulus were ignored and retaken. For each stimulus, we calculated a mean evoked potential by averaging the responses to the 10 repetitions."

The peak-power frequency of these stimuli is slightly lower than the inverse of the pulse duration and ranges from 0.17 to 27.9 kHz (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We used single-cycle bipolar sine wave pulses to be consistent with the previous study investigating peripheral frequency tuning (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2015</a>). In that study, single-cycle pulse stimuli were necessary because it would be impossible to separate the stimulus artifact of longer tone stimuli from the oscillatory response of the oscillating receptors. Furthermore, single-cycle pulses are behaviorally relevant stimuli because they closely resemble the pulse-type communication signals of these species (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

The advance here is that they extend this observation to the electrosensory lobe where electroreceptor sensory information is processed. They do this in the context of comparisons to other species that do not have oscillating, but spiking, receptors and are sensitive to electrosensory waveform variation. The analysis indicates that the oscillating receptor synchrony is processed faithfully in the EL of oscillating receptor fish, and the comparisons have interesting evolutionary implications: anatomical, physiological, and behavioral."

A more systematic discussion, aimed at ruling out alternative hypotheses, could lend more support for the primary conclusion. There is also too much focus on coincidence detection in the nELL. The authors should either provide recordings from nELL neurons showing that they indeed act like coincidence detectors or tone this down to focus on their results. It seems that the authors propose that the coding mechanism is based on coincidence detection with different delays from input coming from both sides of the body in EL and not in nELL for species with spiking receptors.

The frequency content of a single-cycle sinewave pulse is inherently correlated with pulse duration. Therefore, our measurement of frequency sensitivity is, in a way, correlated with pulse-duration sensitivity. Importantly, however, frequency sensitivity is often interpreted in terms of the power spectrum of communication signals, and previous studies have demonstrated a clear correlation between the frequency tuning of knollenorgans and the peak power frequencies of species-specific EOD pulses, at least for clade A species (e.g. Hopkins, 1981; Baker et al., 2015). The communication signals of our three study species closely resemble single-cycle pulses (See <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> of the revised manuscript) and therefore, a measurement of frequency sensitivity based on single-cycle pulses is biologically relevant. Furthermore, we used single-cycle sinewave pulses to be consistent with the previous study (Baker et al. 2015, <i>eLife</i>). In that study, single-cycle pulses were used instead of longer tone blips because the stimulus artifact generated by longer tones would be impossible to separate from the oscillatory response of the electroreceptors. We included this rationale in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript (subsection \u201cStimuli and Evoked Potential Analysis\u201d, fourth paragraph)."

Unfortunately, we do not have data related to the proposed experiment, and comparing the results from Baker et al.

In the previous study, single electroreceptors were stimulated with constant-current pulses in nA. In our study, we used global electrosensory stimuli to stimulate all receptors at constant electric fields measured in mV/cm at the position of the fish in the test tank. It is not clear how a given electric field intensity will relate to current magnitude at a given receptor pore. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately relate the intensity of the electric field experienced by the fish in our experiment with the constant current used to stimulate individual electroreceptors in the previous study. For this reason, we are unable to include these analyses in the revised manuscript. Nevertheless, we discuss this important issue in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion of the revised manuscript."

We rephrased the Abstract and Discussion (first paragraph) in the revised manuscript, taking into consideration this comment. In addition, we expanded our Discussion to include alternative hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying our results (second paragraph). Since electrosensory stimulation elicits an increase in the amplitude of oscillations and a phase reset that causes transient oscillatory synchrony, we discuss the possibility that the electrosensory system detects a change in oscillatory amplitude. Given the available evidence and temporal precision of the responses, we suggest that the underlying mechanism for sensory coding is more likely the detection of transient oscillatory synchrony than the detection of a change in oscillatory amplitude, but the increase in amplitude likely makes detecting this synchrony an easier task."

The available evidence suggests that species with spiking receptors perform coincidence detection in the nELL so that nELL neurons only spike in response to synchronous input from multiple receptors with adjacent receptive fields, as we propose for species with oscillatory receptors (Bell and Grant 1989). Studies of ELa in species with spiking receptors instead suggest that anti-coincidence detection of inputs from widely separated receptive fields is used in signal waveform analysis (Friedman and Hopkins 1998; Lyons-Warren et al. 2013). We included in the Introduction of the revised manuscript a brief description of what is currently known about information processing in the ascending knollenorgan pathway (fourth paragraph). In this paragraph, we explain the projections from the electroreceptors to the hindbrain nELL (ipsilateral), from the hindbrain to ELa (bilateral), and from ELa to ELp (ipsilateral). In addition, we briefly explain how cells in ELa perform EOD waveform analysis. With this explanation in the Introduction, we hope to have cleared up any confusion."

Critically, it is not clear what causes these primarily in their recordings. Is it the spiking of post-synaptic neurons or spikes traveling down pre-synaptic axons? This question is important as the authors' data shows surprising similarity between field potentials recorded at i) and ii) in EL of Petrocephalus tenuicauda and those recorded in ELa and ELp of Petrocephalus microphthalmus. Doesn't this undermine the argument that the differentiation of EL serves to underlie discrimination of EOD waveform in the latter species?</i>"

Evoked potentials reflect summated activity across many neurons; therefore, one caveat of this technique is that it does not reflect the diversity of properties observed at the level of single neurons. However, evoked potentials are a reliable and relatively simple technique that provides valuable insight into signal processing and integrative synaptic processes in these nuclei, and generate data that can be compared to a large number of studies that have also used this technique. We have included this information together with a brief discussion of what evoked potentials represent in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript (subsection \u201cEvoked Potential Recordings\u201d, first paragraph)."

The similarities suggest that some properties of the electrosensory system are conserved across all mormyrids. The differences suggest parallel evolutionary change in a neural circuit that allowed for a novel perceptual ability in two groups of mormyrids. These similarities and differences do not undermine the argument that the differentiation of EL serves to underlie discrimination of EOD waveform, because the evoked potentials do not capture what is happening on a single-neuron level, only a population level. Further, we did not address the sensitivity of single neurons to variation in EOD waveform, but of evoked potentials to variation in pulse duration/frequency content (analyzing sensitivity to pulse waveform per se requires temporal manipulations of the waveform that do not alter the frequency content, as in Carlson et al., 2011). Among the differences that we emphasize between these two groups of species is the ability to process short, high-frequency signals. Rather than undermining this argument, our results set the stage for future studies investigating the differences and similarities at cellular and circuit levels that allow species with ELa/ELp (but not species with small EL) to detect variation in EOD waveform."
