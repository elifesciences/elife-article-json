Mutations in PS1 lead to dominant-inheritance of early-onset familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (FAD). Although expression of FAD-linked PS1 mutations enhances toxic A\u03b2 production, the importance of other APP metabolites and \u03b3-secretase substrates in the etiology of the disease has not been confirmed. We report that neurons expressing FAD-linked PS1 variants or functionally deficient PS1 exhibit enhanced axodendritic outgrowth due to increased levels of APP intracellular C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF). APP expression is required for exuberant neurite outgrowth and hippocampal axonal sprouting observed in knock-in mice expressing FAD-linked PS1 mutation. APP-CTF accumulation initiates CREB signaling cascade through an association of APP-CTF with G\u03b1s protein. We demonstrate that pathological PS1 loss-of-function impinges on neurite formation through a selective APP gain-of-function that could impact on axodendritic connectivity and contribute to aberrant axonal sprouting observed in AD patients."

Mutations in PS1 lead to dominant-inheritance of early-onset familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (FAD). Although expression of FAD-linked PS1 mutations enhances toxic A\u03b2 production, the importance of other APP metabolites and \u03b3-secretase substrates in the etiology of the disease has not been confirmed. We report that neurons expressing FAD-linked PS1 variants or functionally deficient PS1 exhibit enhanced axodendritic outgrowth due to increased levels of APP intracellular C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF). APP expression is required for exuberant neurite outgrowth and hippocampal axonal sprouting observed in knock-in mice expressing FAD-linked PS1 mutation. APP-CTF accumulation initiates CREB signaling cascade through an association of APP-CTF with G\u03b1s protein. We demonstrate that pathological PS1 loss-of-function impinges on neurite formation through a selective APP gain-of-function that could impact on axodendritic connectivity and contribute to aberrant axonal sprouting observed in AD patients."

These abnormalities resemble changes seen in the brain in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

Inheritance of dominant forms of mutations in genes encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins (<i>PSEN1</i> and <i>PSEN2</i> genes) cause aggressive forms of early onset familial AD (FAD). A mutation in presenilin genes causes autosomal dominant early-onset familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (FAD) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tanzi and Bertram, 2001</a>). Gene knockout studies in mice reveal that PS1 acts as the catalytic core of the multisubunit \u03b3-secretase complex that is responsible for regulated intramembranous proteolysis of several type-I transmembrane protein substrates. Over 90 substrates have been identified so far including amyloid precursor protein (APP), Notch and Eph receptors and ligands, cadherins, and deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kopan and Ilagan, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">McCarthy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Parks and Curtis, 2007</a>). Several of these substrates are known for their diverse functions during neuronal development including axon guidance, neurite outgrowth, and synaptogenesis. In the case of APP, the most studied \u03b3-secretase substrate, sequential ectodomain shedding by \u03b1-secretase, which occurs mainly at the cell surface, or \u03b2-secretase is required before subsequent cleavage by \u03b3-secretase (<a href=\"#bib16\">Deyts et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Haass et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Thinakaran and Koo, 2008</a>). Therefore, cleavage of full-length APP (APP-FL) by \u03b1- or \u03b2-secretases releases the entire ectodomain (soluble APP\u03b1 or soluble APP\u03b2, respectively), leaving behind membrane-bound C-terminal fragments (CTF), comprising the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain (APP-C83 and APP-C99, respectively). Subsequent cleavage of APP-CTF by \u03b3-secretase releases the cytosolic domain from the membrane (<span class=\"underline\">A</span>PP <span class=\"underline\">i</span>ntra<span class=\"underline\">c</span>ellular <span class=\"underline\">d</span>omain, AICD) and either p3 fragment or the neurotoxic A\u03b2 peptide. Consequently, inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity would prevent accumulation of A\u03b2 and AICD in favor of accumulation of APP-C83 or APP-C99 depending on their prior non-amylogenic \u03b1-CTF or amylogenic \u03b2-CTF cleavage products, respectively."

No evidence has been described that such a role may be an important contributor of disease states associated with \u03b3-secretase components. The contribution of APP holoprotein and other PS1-dependent substrates in the AD etiology has not been fully examined. The present work focuses on determining the importance of PS1-dependent modulation of APP-CTF accumulation and the subsequent effects on associated signaling that promote neurite outgrowth. We report here that alteration of \u03b3-secretase activity, through pharmacologic PS1 inhibition, genetic <i>Psen1</i> ablation, or expression of FAD-linked PS1 variants, enhances neurite outgrowth. Our findings indicate that APP is required for PS1-dependent changes in neurite outgrowth. Ablation of APP expression prevented aberrant axonal sprouting observed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of <i>PSEN1</i> knock-in mouse model harboring FAD-linked PS1 variant. APP-CTF accumulation contributed to \u03b3-secretase-dependent increases of CREB signaling cascade seen in neurons that exhibit PS1 loss-of-function, an effect that was prohibited through adenylate cyclase inhibition. Our results provide the first demonstration that a pathological loss of PS1 function leads to a selective gain of APP function that may impact axodendritic connectivity."

We also observed that overexpression of APP and concurrent \u03b3-secretase inhibition, that produce an accumulation of APP-CTF and other \u03b3-secretase-dependent CTF substrates, leads to an increase in neurite outgrowth (<a href=\"#bib17\">Deyts et al., 2012</a>). Given the fact that APP plays important roles in neurite outgrowth through the function of its extra- and intracellular fragments (review by (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chasseigneaux and Allinquant, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Muller and Zheng, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nicolas and Hassan, 2014</a>)), we wanted to establish the physiological significance of endogenous APP and its metabolites that are generated through modulation of \u03b3-secretase activity. First, we have examined neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons lacking APP using APP knockout (APP KO) mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Lack of APP expression modestly (but significantly) and selectively altered axonal outgrowth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b1</a>; WT,\u00a01.00 \u00b1 0.03; APP KO, 0.77 \u00b1 0.05, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), whereas the dendritic outgrowth was not affected (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b2</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, we confirmed the physiological consequence of \u03b3-secretase inhibition on neurite outgrowth, using \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Compound E (<a href=\"#bib53\">Seiffert et al., 2000</a>). We observed that inhibition of \u03b3-secretase in WT neurons enhances axonal and dendritic outgrowth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b1 and b2</a>), with a more predominant effect on the axon as reflected by an increase of the axon/dendrite area ratio (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b3</a>;\u00a0WT,\u00a01.78 \u00b1 0.07; WT+CompE, 2.52 \u00b1 0.18, <i>P</i>&lt; 0.05). Next, we examined whether \u03b3-secretase activity influenced neurite outgrowth in neurons lacking APP. Interestingly, we observed that neurons treated with \u03b3-secretase inhibitor did not exhibit axonal or dendritic outgrowth in the absence of APP expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b1 and b2</a>), suggesting that APP is the main contributing factor in \u03b3-secretase-mediated neurite outgrowth."

We observed that concomitant expression of APP-FL and inhibition of \u03b3-secretase are sufficient to reestablish the enhancement of axodendritic outgrowth at the level seen in WT neurons treated with a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a and b</a>). In our neuronal cultures, fractionation of lysates on Tris-Tricine gels showed that the inhibition of \u03b3-secretase activity produced an overall increase of APP-CTF whereas APP-FL was not changed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As expected, we confirmed that \u03b3-secretase dependent processing of APP affects accumulation of both APP-CTF\u03b1 and APP-CTF\u03b2, at least in HEK293 and COS-7 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Overexpression of APP-FL was not sufficient to induce axodendritic outgrowth, although accumulation of APP-CTF through \u03b3-secretase inhibition did promote axodendritic outgrowth. This set of data confirmed that inhibition of \u03b3-secretase activity favors a preferential augmentation of axonal outgrowth in comparison to the dendritic compartment, as shown by the increase of the axon/dendrite ratio (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b3</a>). This effect was abolished in the absence of endogenous APP expression and restored by APP overexpression. Our findings emphasize that both \u03b3-secretase inhibition and APP expression are required to induce axodendritic outgrowth."

In earlier studies, it has been proposed that expression of FAD-linked PS1 mutant proteins may attenuate \u03b3-secretase activity,\u00a0consequently limiting proteolysis of full-length protein substrates and, therefore, accumulating their CTF (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bentahir et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">De Strooper, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shen and Kelleher, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Walker et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wolfe, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Woodruff et al., 2013</a>). Based on our results reported in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>,\u00a0we\u00a0wondered whether pathogenic PS1 mutations, that have been described to affect \u03b3-secretase activity, might influence neurite outgrowth. We focused on three PS1 variants that carry a PS1-M146L substitution and PS1-\u0394E9 deletion of exon 9, which is known to cause earlier age-of-onset FAD, and a known dominant negative PS1-D385A substitution. We stably transfected HEK293 cells with wild-type human PS1 (PS1-WT) or with PS1 mutations. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a1</a>, pools of established stably transfected HEK293 cells expressed comparable levels of PS1 protein, as shown by cell lysates immunoblotted with a PS1 polyclonal antibody that detects PS1-FL and PS1-NTF. Next, we analyzed the ability of PS1 mutation to modulate the accumulation of APP-CTF in PS1 stable HEK293 cells that overexpressed APP-FL (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a2</a>). We observed that APP-CTF accumulates in PS1 mutants, as compared to PS1-WT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a2</a>), confirming previous findings that pathogenic PS1 mutations might reduce \u03b3-secretase activity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bentahir et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">De Strooper, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Heilig et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shen and Kelleher, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Walker et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Woodruff et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Xia et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, we observed that neurons expressing PS1-\u0394E9 mutation exhibit a significant increase in axodendritic outgrowth (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b and c</a>), an effect that is exacerbated by the presence of APP-FL in neurons overexpressing PS1-M146L and PS1-D385A mutations. Taken together, our results demonstrate that pathogenic PS1 mutations favor axodendritic outgrowth as seen under a condition that reduces \u03b3-secretase activity."

In this later strain, PS1-M146V protein is expressed at a level equivalent to WT protein level, therefore mimicking human FAD patients carrying this mutation. These PS1 KI\u00a0mice do not exhibit overt A\u03b2 accumulation or deposition; thus, the main interest of using this mouse model is to understand the contribution of early development of AD process. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, Western blot analysis of steady-state APP expression levels in brains of E15 mouse embryos reveals a significant increase of APP-CTF\u03b1 in PS1 KI, and larger increase of both APP-CTF\u03b1 and APP-CTF\u03b2 in PS1 KO as compared to WT. Analysis of brain lysates revealed similar increases of APP-CTF in total membrane fractions of heterozygous (PS1 KI/+)\u00a0and homozygous (PS1 KI/KI) brains harvested during synaptogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a1</a>, postnatal day 10 \u2013 P10) or in adulthood (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; 6 months-old \u2013 6M), as compared to their WT littermates.

Consequently, ratios of APP-CTF/APP-FL were increased in PS1 KI brains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b2</a>), suggesting that the FAD-linked PS1 mutation may result in loss of activity toward APP proteolysis, leading to accumulation of membrane-tethered APP-CTF. However, APP-CTF accumulated to a lesser extent in PS1 KI as compared to PS1 KO (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>), therefore supporting the notion of partial loss-of-function mutant."

We observed a significant increase in both axonal and dendritic outgrowth in PS1 KI\u00a0cultured neurons as compared to WT, an effect as substantial as the effect seen in neurons lacking PS1 expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c and d</a>). Axonal and dendritic outgrowth was increased without apparent bias toward either neuronal compartment. Strikingly, we noticed that PS1 mutation-induced neurite outgrowth was comparable in neurons expressing one or two copies of the mutated gene, which is consistent with the idea of autosomal dominant inheritance of <i>PSEN1</i> mutations. Our findings also suggest that modest reduction in \u03b3-secretase activity through an endogenous level of PS1 mutation expression is sufficient to influence drastically axodendritic outgrowth, an effect that emerges in conjunction with modest APP-CTF accumulation. To follow-up, we investigated the influence of APP expression on neurite extension. We examined whether neurons lacking APP expression would exhibit a similar level of exuberant neurite outgrowth in FAD-linked PS1-M146V variant using double crossed APP KO x PS1 KI mice. Remarkably, lack of APP expression abolished excess axonal and dendritic outgrowth found in neurons carrying the PS1-M146V mutation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d1</a>; 97% and 62% reduction, respectively). We also subjected neuronal culture generated from PS1 KI and APP KO x PS1 KI mice to \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Compound E. We observed that presenilin-dependent enhancement of axodendritic outgrowth was not furthermore increased in APP KO x PS1 KI cultures (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), supporting the idea that APP is the major contributing substrate in FAD-linked PS1 mutation induced neurite outgrowth."

We and others have previously reported that \u03b3-secretase-dependent accumulation of Deleted Colorectal Cancer C-terminal fragment (DCC-CTF) promotes neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parent et al., 2005</a>) and motor neuron explants (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bai et al., 2011</a>). We used primary neurons generated from DCC KO mice, which lack DCC expression, to investigate the contribution of DCC to \u03b3-secretase mediated axodendritic outgrowth. We observed that lack of DCC expression does not affect axonal or dendritic outgrowth in our cell culture system (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c and d</a>). Within the same experimental conditions, sets of neurons were treated with \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Compound E to abrogate substrate proteolysis. In these groups, enhancement of axodendritic outgrowth was similar in na\u00efve WT as compared to DCC KO neurons treated with a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We also confirmed that lack of DCC expression did not affect axodendritic outgrowth in neurons expressing FAD-linked PS1-M146V mutation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c and d</a>), even though DCC-CTF was increased in cultured neuron lysates of homozygous and heterozygote PS1 KI relative to WT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). An increase of DCC-CTF detection was also significant in vivo during early brain development and the period of synaptogenesis (E15-P14) in PS1 KI mice as compared to WT (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Therefore, our results indicate that DCC is not an essential substrate for \u03b3-secretase induced neurite outgrowth."

Consistent with our neurite outgrowth analysis, GAP-43 expression is significantly increased in hippocampal areas of PS1 KI mice, an effect that was abrogated if APP expression was absent (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Quantitative analysis reveals that intensity of GAP-43 immunostaining was selectively increased in the stratum lacunosum moleculare (LMol) and the outer and inner molecular layers of the dentate gyrus (OMoDG and IMoDG, respectively) in PS1 KI mice as compared to WT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). An increase of GAP-43 immunostaining intensity levels was seen in these selective areas as shown by representative line scan projection of GAP-43 staining in 6 month-old PS1 KI mice as compared to their WT littermates, an effect that was not observed in mice lacking APP expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a3</a>). We confirmed by Western blot analysis that GAP-43 expression was increased as well in the hippocampus as early as at postnatal day 10 (P10) in PS1 KI as compared to APP KO x PS1 KI mice, an effect that was not observed in the cortex of these mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4b and c</a>). Confocal microscopy corroborated the existence of stronger immunofluorescence intensity in the dentate gyrus, especially in OMoDG layer of mice expressing FAD-linked PS1 variant as compared to their counterpart APP KO x PS1 KI littermates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). The surface render projection of zoomed areas revealed that GAP-43 immunostaining is more abundant in PS1 KI surrounding neurite-like structures, which was not seen in APP KO x PS1 KI mouse brain sections. Altogether, our results indicate that mice expressing an endogenous level of FAD-linked PS1 variant exhibit exuberant neurite outgrowth and axonal sprouting at close proximity to the perforant path, which requires APP expression."

Consequentially, cAMP/PKA cascade is initiated and leads to phosphorylation of CREB. As described in our previous studies (<a href=\"#bib17\">Deyts et al., 2012</a>) and shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, we observed that concomitant expression of APP-FL and inhibition of \u03b3-secretase activity favors neurite outgrowth (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>) and associated increase of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>) in cortical neuronal cultures. In support of this finding, we also observed that neurons overexpressing APP-C99 (the APP \u03b2-secretase cleaved CTF by-product) exhibit increased axodendritic outgrowth that was prevented by the expression of a C99 construct lacking the G\u03b1<sub>S</sub>-protein interacting site where three alanine substitutions were introduced to replace the basic residues of the BBXXB motif in APP-CTF (named C99mutAAA; see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, we\u00a0observed that neurons expressing APP-C99 or mAICD constructs exhibit a strong increase of CREB signaling illustrated by the enhancement of pCREB immunostaining. These outcomes were abolished in neurons overexpressing mutant lacking G\u03b1<sub>S</sub>-protein interacting site C99mutAAA and mAICDmutAAA, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b1 and b2</a>). As expected for CREB signaling, these effects are more noticeable in the somatic/nuclear area as compared to dendritic projections (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To further establish the importance of \u03b3-secretase dependent APP-CTF accumulation in this process, we overexpressed membrane-targeted mAICD and APP-NTF by-products in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) or neurons generated from APP KO (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c1 and c2</a>, respectively). We observed that neither sAPP\u03b1 nor sAPP\u03b2 overexpression influenced CREB signaling in HEK293 cells or in neurons lacking APP expression (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2a</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c1</a>, respectively). We confirmed this observation by Western blots of MEF lysates generated from APP KO mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c2</a>) and lysates of HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>). Altogether, our results point out that increase in APP-CTF accumulation is causing changes in neurite outgrowth and CREB signaling in PS1 loss-of-function neurons, therefore supporting the idea that APP-CTF accumulation is the main contributing factor to PS1-dependent modulation of CREB signaling."

                                "text": "As a read-out of APP-CTF downstream signaling, we first assessed if the expression of PS1 mutation could alter cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling cascades using antibodies that detect phosphorylated PKA substrates (pPKA; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We observed that primary cortical neurons generated from PS1 KI mice exhibit a significant overall increase of phosphorylated PKA substrates (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Associated PKA-dependent CREB signaling was substantiated by an increase in pCREB immunostaining as compared to their WT littermates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a1 and a2</a>). As we have described previously (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barnes et al., 2008</a>), we reiterate here that neurons lacking PS1 function exhibit increased pCREB levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a2</a>). As expected for CREB signaling, these effects are more noticeable in the somatic/nuclear area as compared to dendritic projections (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>). We confirmed by Western blot analysis that pCREB was significantly increased in neuron lysates generated from PS1 KI mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b1 and b3</a>), an effect that was also reported in neuroblastoma cell lines and mouse brains expressing FAD-linked PS1 mutations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Muller et al., 2011</a>). In line with PS1 loss-of-function phenotype, Western blot analysis of neuronal lysates confirmed increases of pCREB levels in neurons treated with \u03b3-secretase inhibitor or neurons generated from PS1 KO mouse brains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b2 and b3</a>). Next, we examined whether or not CREB signaling was influenced by PS1 mutations in cells lacking APP expression. In support of our neurite outgrowth studies presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, we\u00a0likewise observed that neurons generated from APP KO present a significant decrease in pCREB level (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a2</a>). More interestingly, we found that neurons generated from PS1 KI mice that lack APP expression (APP KO x PS1 KI) do not show increased pCREB as observed in PS1 KI littermates, an effect that was not seen in neurons lacking DCC expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a1, a2, b2, and b3</a>). Therefore, we conclude that APP expression is associated with the increase in CREB signaling in PS1 KI\u00a0neurons. Our results confirm that APP is sufficient and necessary to induce CREB signaling in the loss-of-function PS1 mutant (see summary <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

Changes are indicated as strongly increase (\u2191\u2191), slightly increase (\u2191), slightly reduce (\u2193),\u00a0no-change (-), or not determined (ND). Axodendritic components and associated CREB signaling alterations were evaluated in loss or partial loss of \u03b3-secretase activity using \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Compound E, PS1 KO, APPswe/PS1-\u0394E9 (Tg85Dbo) and FAD-linked <i>PSEN1-M146V</i> knock-in (PS1 KI) mouse lines crossed to APP KO and DCC KO mice. Axonal as well as dendritic arborizations were increased in cortical neurons generated from PS1 KO, PS1 KI and Tg85Dbo mice. Augmentation of neurite extension correlates with the increase in CREB signaling and APP-CTF accumulation. Lack of APP expression in PS1 KI mice selectively alters axonal outgrowth that parallels a reduction in CREB signaling, as compared to their PS1 KI littermates. Lack of DCC expression in PS1 KI mice does not affect neurite outgrowth and CREB signaling, as compared to their PS1 KI littermates, therefore supporting the idea that APP is an essential substrate, but not DCC, in \u03b3-secretase-mediated axodendritic plasticity."

                                "text": "CREB signaling possesses a variety of effectors including direct upstream activation of adenylate cyclase and subsequent production of cAMP. We previously reported that APP-CTF induced neurite outgrowth was prohibited in a condition where adenylate cyclase was inhibited (<a href=\"#bib17\">Deyts et al., 2012</a>). We documented that APP-CTF initiates stimulation of adenylate cyclase through trimeric interaction with G\u03b1<sub>S</sub> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Deyts et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, to determine if the increase of CREB signaling seen in PS1 loss-of-function mutants is entirely achieved through the accumulation of APP-CTF mediating adenylate cyclase activation, we treated neurons with adenylate cyclase inhibitor MDL-12,330A (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). We observed that adenylate cyclase inhibition profoundly reduced CREB activity in neurons generated from PS1 KI. We also confirmed that enhanced neurite outgrowth in neurons expressing PS1 mutants was dependent on adenylate cyclase activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). Moreover, we examined if the FAD-linked mutation in APP could modify the propensity of PS1 mutation to induce neurite outgrowth. We generated cortical neuronal cultures from transgenic mouse embryos coexpressing APPswe and PS1-\u0394E9 mutations (Tg85Dbo), a mouse model associated with accumulation of A\u03b2 burden (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jankowsky et al., 2005</a>). We observed a significant increase of axodendritic outgrowth in Tg85Dbo as compared to their non-transgenic littermates, at the same level seen in neurons generated from PS1 KO and PS1 KI (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b2</a>). This effect was completely alleviated by a 24\u00a0hr treatment with adenylate cyclase inhibitor. Altogether, our results confirm the requirement of cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling to induce neurite outgrowth in neurons that exhibit increased APP-CTF (see summary <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

Our study explored the APP molecule as a whole cellular component that could affect neuronal development and perhaps have consequence on the course of AD, thus filling an important gap in AD research. Our results provide a meaningful understanding of how attenuation of \u03b3-secretase activity and gain of APP function relate to each other, and its significance in health and disease. We took advantage of KI mice expressing FAD-linked PS1 variant, an AD mouse model that does not overexpress APP and PS1 mutations, to demonstrate the necessity of APP and its intracellular metabolites in the development of AD, before the emergence of overt cerebral A\u03b2 burden. We show striking neuronal influences, mechanistic explanations, and in vivo evidence on nerve growth associated with PS1 mutations. Altogether, our findings clearly indicate that APP is an essential substrate in mediating neurite outgrowth in conditions where \u03b3-secretase activity is inhibited or altered. Our results reveal that selective accumulation of membrane-anchor APP-CTF through its coupling to adenylate cyclase is sufficient to induce these changes."

These results correlate with a large and more moderate increase of APP-CTF in brain lysates prepared from PS1 KO and PS1 KI mice, respectively. This supports the notion of partial loss-of-function of \u03b3-secretase activity associated with FAD-linked PS1 mutation. Strikingly, the lack of APP expression in cortical neurons expressing the PS1-M146V variant led to a recovery of basal axodendritic outgrowth, an effect that was not seen in neurons lacking DCC expression (another \u03b3-secretase substrate). Treatment with the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor did not induce additional axodendritic morphological changes in APP KO x PS1 KI, again supporting the necessity of APP and APP-CTF accumulation in PS1-induced neurite outgrowth. Reduced \u03b3-secretase activity was accompanied by an increase of CREB signaling, an effect that was abolished in APP-deficient neurons and prohibited by adenylate cyclase inhibition. Interestingly, we observed that adult PS1 KI\u00a0mice exhibit aberrant axonal sprouting, especially in hippocampal areas. More importantly, lack of APP expression in the FAD-linked PS1 mutant mouse model eliminated that effect, providing evidence that APP expression is causally implicated with the pathological feature associated with loss-of-function PS1 mutation."

                        "text": "Our investigations point out that APP is not an important contributing factor to neurite formation under normal physiological condition. In fact, loss of APP expression only slightly affects axonal outgrowth, at least in cell culture system. Therefore, our observations reinforce the notion that APP must be tightly regulated, likely through secretase-dependent cleavages and degradation process, which would render the molecule less vital for global cellular function. In support of this idea, knocking down APP in mice does not lead to severe phenotype, therefore questioning also the significance of the holoprotein (<a href=\"#bib16\">Deyts et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Muller and Zheng, 2012</a>). Previous studies emphasize this interpretation [review by (<a href=\"#bib16\">Deyts et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Haass et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Muller and Zheng, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Thinakaran and Koo, 2008</a>)]. APP KO mice are viable (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zheng et al., 1995</a>), and present subtle, age-dependent decline in memory tasks (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ring et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schrenk-Siemens et al., 2008</a>). Nonetheless, our study clearly indicates that \u03b3-secretase-dependent inhibition of APP processing, and subsequent APP-CTF accumulation, mediates a striking impact on axodendritic growth. Indeed, we observed that axodendritic outgrowth and associated signaling are reversed in the absence of APP expression in cell culture systems. It has been proposed that ectodomain shedding of cell-surface receptors by \u03b3-secretase complex activity may serve to prevent further cell-surface signaling by a variety of substrates (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kopan and Ilagan, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">McCarthy et al., 2009</a>). Our study clearly demonstrated the importance of this process and the essential contribution of APP-CTF in conditions when PS1 is mutated or \u03b3-secretase activity is reduced. It appears that among all known (and unknown) \u03b3-secretase substrates, APP is the key contributing substrate in observed dysregulation of neurite outgrowth. It is even more remarkable that APP expression would be so critical in controlling neurite development in selective brain areas associated with memory formation. Therefore, APP and its CTF accumulation could play a more critical role in disease states."

Higher intensity levels of GAP-43 correlated with the hippocampal sprouting in the molecular layer seen in mouse model overexpressing the FAD-linked APP variant (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Phinney et al., 1999</a>). Mice expressing the FAD-linked PS1 mutation exhibit similitude in that respect. We would consider these sequences of events as an early indication of AD development since A\u03b2 accumulation and deposition have not occurred yet in this model. We corroborated changes seen in our culture systems with that in mouse brains expressing the FAD-linked PS1-M146V variant, reiterating the importance of APP expression as a cause of exuberant neurite outgrowth and sprouting observed in a PS1 KI mouse model. Clearly, it has been reported that lack of APP expression in rodent or <i>Drosophila</i> models could lead to inaccuracies in axon guidance in some parts of the brain, including the commissural projections (<a href=\"#bib35\">Magara et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Rama et al., 2012</a>) and mushroom body development, a <i>Drosophila</i> brain structure involved in learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib57\">Soldano et al., 2013</a>) [see also (<a href=\"#bib40\">Muller and Zheng, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nicolas and Hassan, 2014</a>) for review]. More interestingly, <i>Drosophila</i> lacking the APP homolog expression requires the APP-CTF component for accurate axonal outgrowth (<a href=\"#bib57\">Soldano et al., 2013</a>), indicating the significance of APP-CTF for proper axonal guidance and memory function in <i>Drosophila</i>."

                        "text": "One important question that arises from our findings is whether APP/APP-CTF accumulation and associated signaling sequences that impact neurite outgrowth are contributing factors to the disease, or perhaps considered as a compensatory epiphenomenon? One could argue that PS1 loss-of-function mutations favor memory formation since APP-CTF accumulation leads to CREB signaling. It is widely accepted that CREB signaling is important for memory consolidation and cellular events that preserve cell integrity [review by (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abel and Nguyen, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alberini and Kandel, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lonze and Ginty, 2002</a>)]. Conversely, ablation of CREB is associated with axonal and dendritic outgrowth defects (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lonze et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Redmond et al., 2002</a>). Therefore, an increase in neurite outgrowth along with CREB signaling would support a prominent role of APP in learning and memory. Even though long-term synaptic plasticity is enhanced in several mouse models expressing FAD-linked PS1 variants (<a href=\"#bib43\">Parent et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Parent and Thinakaran, 2010</a>), which is consistent with an increase in CREB signaling, a number of these mice performed poorly in a variety of memory tasks (<a href=\"#bib65\">Webster et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Xia et al., 2015</a>). One alternative to consider is the detrimental consequence of over-active CREB signaling. An increase of CREB signaling, in cell lines and brain lysates generated from mouse lines carrying PS1 mutations (including the PS1M146V mutation), can be reversed or normalized by interfering with ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and the IP<sub>3</sub>-dependent signaling pathway, an effect that eliminated A\u03b2 toxicity and cell death normally observed in these cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Muller et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shilling et al., 2014</a>) [see also (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guo et al., 1999</a>)]. Therefore, we stipulate that excessive activation of the CREB pathway may render the cell more vulnerable to injury. Excitatory synaptic plasticity is increased in neurons expressing FAD-linked PS1 variants (<a href=\"#bib43\">Parent et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Parent and Thinakaran, 2010</a>); an effect that causes exaggeration of A\u03b2 production (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cirrito et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kamenetz et al., 2003</a>). Recent studies demonstrated that chronic entorhinal cortex hyperexcitability in an AD mouse model harboring APP mutations could contribute to a consequential increase in A\u03b2 burden (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yamamoto et al., 2015</a>), opening up speculation about the role of APP in the synaptically-driven perforant path cascade of events (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buxbaum et al., 1998</a>). Indeed, A\u03b2 burden is reduced in the Tg85Dbo AD mouse model where the perforant path projections are disrupted (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lazarov et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sheng et al., 2002</a>). It remains to be determined if APP-CTF accumulation would affect any of these outcomes."

Indeed, it has been well documented that the expression of genes encoding several FAD-linked PS1 mutations favors the accumulation of A\u03b2 and potential disease-related toxicity especially in combination with overexpression of APP, at least in animal models (<a href=\"http://www.alzforum.org/research-models\">http://www.alzforum.org/research-models</a>). However, a link between AD, aberrant neuronal sprouting in the hippocampal area, partial loss-of-function of \u03b3-secretase activity, and accumulation of APP-CTF has not been described so far. Interestingly, it has been reported that APP-C99 accumulation also takes place selectively in the hippocampal area of 3xTgAD mice (a more aggressive model harboring PS1-M146V/APPswe/Tau-P301L mutations), even prior to accumulation of A\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lauritzen et al., 2012</a>). APP-CTF accumulation is found surrounding dystrophic neurites in KI mice expressing the FAD-linked PS1-L166P mutation and two copies of APP-WT (<a href=\"#bib31\">Vidal et al., 2012</a>). We also found that neurons generated from transgenic mice coexpressing APPswe and PS1-\u0394E9 mutations (Tg89Dbo) exhibit exuberant axodendritic outgrowth that was prohibited by adenylate cyclase inhibition, despite APP-CTF accumulation. Accordingly, we argue that the AD-like aberrant sprouting phenotype depends on signaling downstream of APP-CTF and is preventable through the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Altogether, we demonstrated that APP expression and accumulation of its intracellular fragment are required for exuberant neurite outgrowth associated with pathological PS1 loss-of-function mutations before the emergence of amyloid burden. Our discovery of APP-dependent axonal sprouting in AD mouse models is certainly novel and of great interest for the understanding of how AD process is initiated. Therapeutic inhibition of \u03b3-secretase and the resulting accumulation of APP-CTF could have significant consequences for AD treatment."

Soluble APPs were fractionated on 4\u201320% SDS gels and revealed using APP<sub>NTH-452</sub> polyclonal antibody on Western blots made from conditioned media lysates collected 24\u00a0hr after transfection (<a href=\"#bib61\">Vetrivel et al., 2009</a>). Endogenous DCC full-length (DCC-FL) and DCC endoproteolytic C-terminal fragment (DCC-CTF) were detected using G97-449 DCC antibody. PS1\u2009N-terminal fragment (PS1-NTF) was detected using PS1<sub>NT</sub> antiserum (<a href=\"#bib17\">Deyts et al., 2012</a>). Detection of GAPDH or Flotilin-2 proteins with selective antibodies was used as loading control. Endogenous phosphorylated CREB was detected using pCREB (Ser133) antibody. To increase accuracy and sensitivity, Western blots were quantified by fluorescence using Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). A fixed size box was drawn surrounded the band of interest and quantified within the same gel. Using Odyssey Infrared Imaging software (Li-Cor Biosciences), the band quantification method feature with average background subtraction from top and bottom was employed to determine the level of integrated fluorescence intensity."

For the quantification, several \ufb01elds of view per section (every sixth section) were acquired using a motorized Nikon TE 2000 microscope using 4X objective. The immunoreactivity was quantified with Metamorph software by measuring the integrated intensity level divided by the number of pixels per thresholded area. The results were expressed as arbitrary units. Confocal 300 nm z-stack images were acquired using Leica SP5 II STED-CW Super-resolution Laser Scanning Confocal using 20X and 63X objectives. Deconvolved z-stack images were generated using Huygens software (Scientific Volume Imaging,\u00a0The Netherlands) and processed using MetaMorph software."

To achieve this, the authors employed both immortalized cell lines (HEK293) as well as primary cultured neurons from mouse lines expressing various mutated forms of PS1 (M146V and \u25b3E9) and the morphology of the neurons are studied microscopically. First, the authors inhibited PS1 pharmacologically and observed an exuberant outgrowth of both axons and dendrites. Interestingly, such effects were not observed in cortical neurons from APP knock-out mice, and they were restored upon addition of an APP-overexpression vectors. From these results, the authors argued that the accumulation of APP intracellular C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) upon PS1 inhibition is the cause of the outgrowth. Next, the authors observed the same phenotypes when looking at HEK293 cells transfected with vectors carrying different PS1 mutations, all of which required APP expression. To further explore this finding, the authors studied primary cortical neurons from mice carrying the PS1M146V mutation (found in familial cases of Alzheimer's disease \u2013 FAD) and found that the increased axodendritic outgrowth is specific to the accumulation of APP-CTF, as knockout of Deleted Colorectal Cancer (DCC), another substrate of PS1, did not abolish the aforementioned phenotype. The authors moved on to study the consequences of neurite outgrowth in vivo by examining the brains of mice expressing the M146V mutant with or without APP expression."

Lastly, the authors utilized various biochemical and pharmacological approaches on cultured neurons to demonstrate the CREB signaling cascade and its upstream effector, adenylyl cyclase, as the main mechanism behind the increased axodendritic outgrowth. Overall, the experiments are well-designed and executed and are an important addition to the literature in this area with a few caveats as discussed in minor comments to the authors that should be addressed."
