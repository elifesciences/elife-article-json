A recent epidemic in the Indian subcontinent (ISC) caused up to 80% of global VL and over 30,000 deaths per year. Resistance against antimonial drugs has probably been a contributing factor in the persistence of this epidemic. Here we use whole genome sequences from 204 clinical isolates to track the evolution and epidemiology of <i>L. donovani</i> from the ISC. We identify independent radiations that have emerged since a bottleneck coincident with 1960s DDT spraying campaigns. A genetically distinct population frequently resistant to antimonials has a two base-pair insertion in the aquaglyceroporin gene LdAQP1 that prevents the transport of trivalent antimonials. We find evidence of genetic exchange between ISC populations, and show that the mutation in LdAQP1 has spread by recombination. Our results reveal the complexity of <i>L. donovani</i> evolution in the ISC in response to drug treatment."

The number after the last forward slash in the isolate name indicates when the sample was isolated from the patient in terms of months after onset of a one-month treatment. Patients were followed up for 12 months to assess treatment outcome, with a few exceptions that were lost to follow up and for which the last known outcome is shown mentioning the last recorded time point. The SSG activity index is calculated by dividing the IC50 of a specific strain by the IC50 of BPK206/0cl10 (a sensitive control included in all SSG-susceptibility tests). Activity indexes above 3 are considered to indicate SSG-resistance.

The 'ISC1-191 lineage' refers to fixed homozygous SNPs between all of the core population and all of ISC1. The 'ISC2-183 lineage' refers to fixed homozygous SNPs between ISC2 (Bangladesh) and ISC3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10 and ungrouped isolates (India or Nepal). (<b>b</b>)\u00a0Number of SNPs unique to each population or lineage. SNPs were determined as unique where their intraspecific frequency was &gt;0.95 and &lt;0.05 in all other samples (excluding ungrouped samples). The number of samples did not reflect the number of SNPs or haplotypes: haplotype diversity was &gt;0.99 for all groups except ISC7 (0.34). (<b>c</b>) Genes ordered by ID with two or more SNPs and \u03c0/kb&gt;1. The non-synonymous variant V185M in a NADH-flavin oxidoreductase/NADH oxidase gene (LdBPK_120730) was present here in the ISC1/2/3 as well as previously being observed in Kenyan <i>L. donovani</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Downing et al., 2012</a>). 956 genes had at least one SNP, of which 566 had SNPs that were not singletons. Only 63 genes contain \u22652 SNPs and 12 genes contain \u22653 SNPs. (<b>d</b>) Mean numbers of SNP differences within and between groups. Rows and columns denote comparisons: within populations, the mean number of SNPs between strain pairs (\u03c0) is shown; and between populations, the mean number of SNPs between samples from each population is given. Within the core population, there was an excess of singletons (Tajima\u2019s D=-2.2, p&lt;0.01, Fu and Li's D=-0.78, Fu and Li\u2019s F=-1.87: the values were the same with either JPCM5 or LV9 as the outgroup). 62.6% of SNPs occurred in one sample only and the correlation of the number of homozygous and heterozygous SNPs per sample was small (r<sup>2</sup>=0.005). 291 distinct haplotypes out of a maximum possible of 382 were resolved in the phased SNPs, with a resulting haplotype diversity (Hd) of 0.994. Nepalese samples were on average more diverse compared to the Indian\u00a0ones (\u03c0=84.3 per Mb vs 66.5, Hd=0.996 vs 0.982). ISC6 was restricted to Nepal (\u03c0=12.2 per Mb). (<b>e</b>) Branch distances between groups using the 2 population (f2) statistic. The scaled correlation in allele frequencies were computed for each reference group (top row) and groups (first column). ISC9 and ISC10 were examined together as one group. The distribution of allele sharing across ISC3/4/5/6 in subsets of trios was compared to that for ISC2 using F-statistics. The relative pairwise correlation in allele frequencies between populations using the f2 test indicated ISC2 as the most consistently divergent population and also highlighted distinctive allele frequencies in the recently emerged Indian ISC7 group. In contrast, groups with possible admixture (ISC9 and ISC10) had much shorter branch lengths. (<b>f</b>)\u00a0f4 ratios for candidate admixed populations for mixture from ISC5, ISC6 and ISC7.Each ratio was computed as <math id=\"inf1\"><mfrac><mrow><msub><mtext>f</mtext><mtext>4</mtext></msub><mtext>(A,outgroup;B,X)</mtext></mrow><mrow><msub><mtext>f</mtext><mtext>4</mtext></msub><mtext>(A,outgroup;B,ISC5)</mtext></mrow></mfrac></math> with A and B as either ISC6 or ISC7.

The gene flow from ISC5 was the f4 ratio and that from B (ISC6 or ISC7) was 1-f4. As expected, if ISC6 and 7 grouped together relative to other groups (f4&gt;0). f4 statistics were considered to support a particular relationship between four individual isolates if 0.05<f4<0.05.

Six were nonsynonymous. These SNPs coincided with a distinct chromosome copy number pattern in ISC7. SNPs were assigned to the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 UTR if they are within 1 Kb of the start or end of the gene (respectively). ISC7 was a recent radiation restricted to India (\u03c0=1.8 per Mb). (<b>h</b>)\u00a0Diagnostic SNPs for ISC5. 32 mutations were unique to ISC5 compared to the other genetically homogeneous populations (ISC2/3/4/6/7/8/9/10), with ISC5 frequency &gt;0.95 and a non-ISC5 frequency &lt;0.05. Eight changes were nonsynonymous. *Nine were previously associated with antimonial resistance, including four samples from this ISC5 dataset (<a href=\"#bib19\">Downing et al., 2011</a>): six of these would change the amino acid sequence. SNPs were assigned to the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 UTR if they are within 1 Kb of the start or end of the gene (respectively). (<b>i</b>) Diagnostic SNPs for disomic\u00a0clade within ISC5. 16 diagnostic SNPs unique to a subset of the ISC5 associated with an expansion of disomic strains from polysomic ancestors (BHU1216/0, BHU239/0, BHU271/0, BHU267/0, BHU800/1, BBU269/0, and BHU273/0). Each SNP had a read-depth allele frequency &gt;0.978 within this group and a frequency &lt;0.04 in the other strains not in this group. These SNPs coincided with a distinct chromosome copy number pattern in this group. Ref is the reference genome BPK282/0cl4 allele and Var is the observed derived one. (<b>j</b>)\u00a0Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and SNP density across chromosomes in the core population. LD was computed as the r<sup>2</sup> values between SNP pairs. SD is the standard deviation. The number of homozygous (hom) and heterozygous (het) mutations per chromosome across all 191 samples is shown. LD was markedly higher for chromosome 31, and lower for 1, 6, 7, 8 and 10. The number of recombinant pairs was largest on chr31 (469), which had the highest somy level and was the most SNP-dense chromosome. (<b>k</b>) A genomic map of SNPs in the core population whose ancestry could be assigned to a population. Using the 191x6 ChromoPainter model, the 610 ancestry-informative SNPs were examined to highlight those with probabilities of being donated given ISC group was &gt;0.4: ISC2 (gold), ISC3 (grey), ISC4 (red), ISC5 (green), ISC6 (blue) and ISC7 (light blue). The representative samples used for the 191x6 ChromoPainter model were BD09 (ISC2), NEP123/6 (ISC3), BPK087/0cl1 (ISC4), BPK275/0cl18 (ISC5), BPK282/0cl4 (ISC6) and BHU200/0 (ISC7). SNPs with probabilities &lt;0.4 are uncoloured. For chr32 and chr35, most recombinant pairs could be attributed to the eight ungrouped hybrid isolates. (<b>l</b>) Number and heterozygosity\u00a0of ancestry-informative SNPs per isolate. The number of homozygous (hom) and heterozygous\u00a0(het) SNPs distinguishing each core sample (191 total) from six representative samples from each genetically distinct ISC population: ISC2 (BD09), ISC3 (NEP123/6), ISC4 (BPK087/0cl1), ISC5 (BPK275/0cl18), ISC6 (BPK282/0cl4) and ISC7 (BHU200/0). There were 610 informative SNPs with an ancestry probability threshold &gt;0.4. The relative ratio of homozygous and heterozygous SNPs denoted the genetic relatedness of the strains. Samples possessing recent common ancestry with the representative strains had few homozygous SNPs but the same rate of heterozygous SNPs compared to other representative samples. Similarly, samples possessing recent common ancestry with multiple representative samples had fewer homozygous SNPs and no change in the heterozygous SNPs. This was apparent for highlighted ungrouped samples BHU815/0, BHU764A1, BHU274/0, BHU574cl4, BHU581cl2, BHU572cl3 (all ISC5/6/7: green and blue); and BHU744/0, BHU774/0 (ISC6/7: blue). In many groups haplotype segments were shared across isolates widely separated in sampling date. For example, in ISC3, 35 haplotype segments were shared between NEP123/6 (2004), BPK507/0 (December 2009), BPK515/0, BPK518/0 and BPK519/0 (all February 2010); 53 haplotype segments were shared between BPK157/0cl5 (October 2002) and BPK602/0 (February 2011) (both ISC9); 44 between BPK280/0 (August 2003) and BPK615/0 (March 2011; both ungrouped); 31 between BHU274/0 (ungrouped, August 2007) with BHU1199/0 (ISC9, November 2010). (<b>m</b>) Distribution of copying probabilities of SNPs in two representative isolates. Expected copying probabilities from Chromopainter assigning ancestry to SNPs from BHU581/0 (Ungrouped, left) and BPK275/0cl18 (ISC5, right) using probabilities derived from a model assigning SNP ancestry to representative samples from ISC2/3/4/5/6/7. Each column shows the percentage of SNPs assigned to each percentage probability of being donated from each population (eg ISC2) for a particular sample (eg BHU581/0). If many SNPs had high probabilities of being donated from a particular population, this implied that sample shared a recent ancestor with that population. BHU581/0 was a putative ISC5/6/7 hybrid, and had 9.4% of its SNPs with ancestry from ISC6 or ISC7, 7.2% from ISC7, and 10.9% from ISC5. In contrast, BPK275/0cl18 was the representative sample for ISC5, and 44.3% of its SNPs had confident ancestry from ISC5. No SNPs from any comparison were assigned probabilities between 50\u201395%, hence these rows are omitted from the table. These ancestry patterns indicated that BPK035/0cl1-BPK043/0cl2, BHU1011/0-BHU770/0cl1, BPK280/0-BPK615/0 and BPK158/0cl9 represented ISC4-related isolates but not mixtures. BHU774/0 and BHU744/0, showed evidence of both ISC6- and ISC7-derived segments. The six ungrouped samples (BHU274/0, BHU815/0, BHU764/0cl1, BHU574cl4, BHU572cl3 and BHU581cl2) were sampled between February 2007 and February 2010 and had high numbers of heterozygous SNPs. High heterozygosity could be symptomatic of genetically distinct parents in a hybrid. For example, if BHU572cl3 and BHU581cl2 (both May 2009) were mixes of ISC5 (BHU573/0, May 2009) and ISC7 (BHU200/0, July 2006) then only 16 out of 280 genotypes (BHU572cl3) and 15 out of 278 genotypes (BHU581cl2) would be unexplained. This was evaluated for different haplotype sharing options and matched the timing of samples (BHU572cl3, BHU574cl4 and BHU581cl2 in relation to BHU573/0; BHU815/0 in relation to BHU816/0). SNPs assigned to populations with a high probability in the 191x6 model provided a framework for predicting strain membership as well as admixture. Comparing the relative difference in distributions of homozygous and heterozygous SNPs between candidate parents within the sample set was sufficient to identify shared ancestry where related lineages were sampled, and visible in the aligned genotypes of the six strains with segments of both ISC5 and ISC6 ancestry. (<b>n</b>) Percentage of haplotype segment copies shared within and between groups. Recipients are shown as columns and donors as rows. Groups with complex ancestries received more segments than they donated: ISC8 from ISC5, ISC6 and ISC7; ISC3, ISC9 and ISC10 from ISC5. These 'recipient' groups were also associated with long external branch lengths in phylogenies. The expected probability per SNP in each population for the 191x191 co-ancestry analysis indicated that strains assigned to populations by Structure were assigned the same one with FineStructure (ISC2/3/4/5/6/7): ISC2 (copying probability &gt;99%), ISC3 (&gt;97%), ISC4 (&gt;98%), ISC5 (&gt;99%), ISC6 (&gt;90%) and ISC7 (&gt;97%). Genetically heterogeneous groups showed a higher rate of segments were received than donated from specific populations: ISC8 from ISC5 (11.3% vs 1.7%), ISC6 (16.6% vs 4.7%) and ISC7 (16.5% vs 6.2%). ISC9 (10.0% vs 0.8%) and ISC10 also received more from ISC5 (11.1% vs 2.5%). ISC5 also donated more to ISC3 (11.0% v 1.9%) suggesting possible ancestral genetic exchange, which may be associated with the long branch lengths leading to ISC3. (<b>o</b>) Four-gamete test for recombination. Four gamete tests showed evidence of recombination in the core population and ISC1. 2043 from 117,055 (1.75%) SNP pairs had a recombination signature in the core population. For the subset of 2,015 SNPs with no missing data R=0.7/Mb. The 8 hybrids were BHU815/0, BHU764A1, BHU274/0, BHU574cl4, BHU581cl2, BHU572cl3 (all ISC5+ISC6/7), BHU744/0 and BHU774/0 (both ISC6/7 only). Recombination\u00a0was evident at 25% of SNPs in ISC1 (184,827 out of 739,581 SNP pairs) based on the four gamete test. This signature varied over 13-fold from chr31 (54.2% of pairs) to chr23 (4%). (<b>p</b>)\u00a0SNP and indel association with Sb<sup>V</sup> resistance. Fisher exact tests evaluated the association of Sb<sup>V</sup>-resistance with SNPs (coded as the number of derived mutations: 0, 1 or 2) and indels (coded as the diploid number of inserted or deleted (-) basepairs). (<b>q</b>) SNP association with in-vitro SSG phenotype.\u00a0SNPs with derived alleles in multiple ISC groups with 6+ non-reference genotypes for which the absolute difference in SSG-R and SSG-S allele frequency was &gt;0.1 with the OR (odds ratio) &gt;4 and Benjamini-Hochberg-Yekutieli corrected t-test p value &lt;0.005. SNPs are ordered by chromosome\u00a0and position. The SSG phenotypes were assessed as ln(EC50) values for the derived (D) and reference (R) alleles. To avoid arbitrarily categorising the sample in vitro Sb<sup>V</sup> phenotypes as R and S using a given threshold\u00a0EC50 value, we compared the log-scaled EC50 values of each allele pair at the 57 SNPs identified using t-tests (p&lt;0.005): the Sb<sup>V</sup>-R alleles had log-scaled EC50 values of 1.13\u20131.84 compared to S ones of 0.01\u20130.50 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Consequently, the 57 SNPs together have power to differentiate\u00a0Sb<sup>V</sup>-R and Sb<sup>V</sup>-S phenotypes. (<b>r</b>)\u00a0SNP association with clinical outcome from SSG treatment. SNPs with derived alleles in multiple ISC groups with 6+ non-reference genotypes\u00a0for which the absolute difference in SSG-cure and SSG-failure allele frequency was\u00a0&gt;0.1 with the OR (odds ratio) &gt;4. The SNPs are ordered by chromosome and position. The SSG phenotypes\u00a0were assessed for the derived (D) and reference (R) alleles. We examined lines for which the patient was treated with SSG and was either cured (n=21) or treatment failed (n=14: death, relapse, no response to treatment) to test a null hypothesis that SSG outcome and SNPs were unlinked.\u00a0An\u00a0alternative\u00a0hypothesis was that SSG-cure patients could be infected with Sb<sup>V</sup>-S parasites, and SSG-fail with Sb<sup>V</sup>-R (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). 32 SNPs were associated with SSG cure (OR&gt;4), including 11 nonsynonymous\u00a0SNPs, but none at a significant level due to the small sample size. (<b>s</b>) Relative strength of purifying selection between ISC populations. Relative strength of purifying selection between ISC populations (columns 1 and 2) as ascertained as the relative rate of accumulation of derived alleles computed as R for all (top), nonsynonymous (middle) and synonymous (bottom) sites. We tested for differential selective pressures among the ISC groups where observed values of R\u00a0statistics deviated by at least four standard errors (SE) from the expected value of 1 (Do et al 2015). The genome-wide values are shown along with the weighted block jackknife confidence\u00a0intervals (lower, median, upper). Derived alleles were more frequent in ISC4 than ISC5, suggesting\u00a0stronger purifying selection\u00a0in ISC5. Comparing ISC2 (Bangladesh) to ISC3-7 (Nepal/India), we found a genome-wide (RG) excess of derived alleles had accumulated in the latter (RG=0.74, 6.15*SE). This\u00a0was not directly attributable to selection because the difference was present in both nonsynonymous\u00a0(RN=0.59, 4.42*SE) or synonymous sites (RS=0.66, 10.82*SE). ISC3/4/5/6 shared genetic ancestors dating to approximately the same origin, so a comparison of their rates should indicate variation in the relative accrual of derived alleles. Despite possessing the largest sample size (n=52) of all ISC populations, ISC5 gained significantly fewer derived alleles genome-wide compared\u00a0to ISC3 (RG=0.75, 11.39*SE), ISC4 (RG=0.65, 7.37*SE) and to a lesser extent, ISC6 (RG=0.82, 3.38*SE). This trend was present in both nonsynonymous and synonymous SNPs but not significant\u00a0for most comparisons\u00a0(an exception was comparing synonymous changes in ISC5 vs ISC4 (RS=0.37, 7.80*SE). Similarly, the rate of accumulation\u00a0of homozygous derived SNPs (R2 values) was higher in ISC4 relative to ISC5 (R2G=0.90, 3.87*SE). Antimonial in vitro resistance was highest in ISC5 (ln[EC50]=1.38 \u00b1 1.45) and lowest in ISC4 (0.13 \u00b1 1.12). Consequently, the relative difference in the rate of accumulation\u00a0of derived alleles in ISC5 that was predominantly isolated in India may reflect different exposure to drug selection compared\u00a0to ISC4 (mainly from Nepal). Further work is required to quantify\u00a0this in relation to variable antimonial resistance levels among samples in each\u00a0population. ISC7 was a genetic subgroup of ISC6 that may be a recent radiation or have undergone\u00a0a substantial\u00a0population\u00a0bottleneck. No genome-wide difference was evident in terms of selction,\u00a0but fewer derived synonymous\u00a0SNPs were found in ISC6 (RS=2.18, 4.44*SE), suggestive stronger\u00a0hitchhiking\u00a0of alleles in ISC7. (<b>t</b>) Multi-allelic sites. Sites with multiple derived alleles compared to reference genome sample\u00a0BPK282/0cl4 in the core population (7, top) and ISC1 (10, bottom)."

                    "text": "<i>Leishmania donovani</i> causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the second most deadly vector-borne parasitic disease. A recent epidemic in the Indian subcontinent (ISC) caused up to 80% of global VL and over 30,000 deaths per year. Resistance against antimonial drugs has probably been a contributing factor in the persistence of this epidemic. Here we use whole genome sequences from 204 clinical isolates to track the evolution and epidemiology of <i>L. donovani</i> from the ISC. We identify independent radiations that have emerged since a bottleneck coincident with 1960s DDT spraying campaigns. A genetically distinct population frequently resistant to antimonials has a two base-pair insertion in the aquaglyceroporin gene LdAQP1 that prevents the transport of trivalent antimonials. We find evidence of genetic exchange between ISC populations, and show that the mutation in LdAQP1 has spread by recombination. Our results reveal the complexity of <i>L. donovani</i> evolution in the ISC in response to drug treatment."

Within the core population, there was an excess of singletons (Tajima\u2019s D=-2.2, p&lt;0.01, Fu and Li's D=-0.78, Fu and Li\u2019s F=-1.87: the values were the same with either JPCM5 or LV9 as the outgroup). 62.6% of SNPs occurred in one sample only and the correlation of the number of homozygous and heterozygous SNPs per sample was small (r<sup>2</sup>=0.005). 291 distinct haplotypes out of a maximum possible of 382 were resolved in the phased SNPs, with a resulting haplotype diversity (Hd) of 0.994. Nepalese samples were on average more diverse compared to the Indian\u00a0ones (\u03c0=84.3 per Mb vs 66.5, Hd=0.996 vs 0.982). ISC6 was restricted to Nepal (\u03c0=12.2 per Mb). (<b>e</b>) Branch distances between groups using the 2 population (f2) statistic. The scaled correlation in allele frequencies were computed for each reference group (top row) and groups (first column). ISC9 and ISC10 were examined together as one group. The distribution of allele sharing across ISC3/4/5/6 in subsets of trios was compared to that for ISC2 using F-statistics. The relative pairwise correlation in allele frequencies between populations using the f2 test indicated ISC2 as the most consistently divergent population and also highlighted distinctive allele frequencies in the recently emerged Indian ISC7 group. In contrast, groups with possible admixture (ISC9 and ISC10) had much shorter branch lengths. (<b>f</b>)\u00a0f4 ratios for candidate admixed populations for mixture from ISC5, ISC6 and ISC7.Each ratio was computed as <math id=\"inf1\"><mfrac><mrow><msub><mtext>f</mtext><mtext>4</mtext></msub><mtext>(A,outgroup;B,X)</mtext></mrow><mrow><msub><mtext>f</mtext><mtext>4</mtext></msub><mtext>(A,outgroup;B,ISC5)</mtext></mrow></mfrac></math> with A and B as either ISC6 or ISC7. Populations X were the 6 samples identified as possible mixtures of the ancestors of ISC5 and ISC6/7: BHU815/0, BHU764A1, BHU274/0, BHU574cl4, BHU581cl2, and BHU572cl3. The gene flow from ISC5 was the f4 ratio and that from B (ISC6 or ISC7) was 1-f4. As expected, if ISC6 and 7 grouped together relative to other groups (f4&gt;0). f4 statistics were considered to support a particular relationship between four individual isolates if 0.05<f4<0.05.

Six were nonsynonymous. These SNPs coincided with a distinct chromosome copy number pattern in ISC7. SNPs were assigned to the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 UTR if they are within 1 Kb of the start or end of the gene (respectively). ISC7 was a recent radiation restricted to India (\u03c0=1.8 per Mb). (<b>h</b>)\u00a0Diagnostic SNPs for ISC5. 32 mutations were unique to ISC5 compared to the other genetically homogeneous populations (ISC2/3/4/6/7/8/9/10), with ISC5 frequency &gt;0.95 and a non-ISC5 frequency &lt;0.05. Eight changes were nonsynonymous. *Nine were previously associated with antimonial resistance, including four samples from this ISC5 dataset (<a href=\"#bib19\">Downing et al., 2011</a>): six of these would change the amino acid sequence. SNPs were assigned to the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 UTR if they are within 1 Kb of the start or end of the gene (respectively). (<b>i</b>) Diagnostic SNPs for disomic\u00a0clade within ISC5. 16 diagnostic SNPs unique to a subset of the ISC5 associated with an expansion of disomic strains from polysomic ancestors (BHU1216/0, BHU239/0, BHU271/0, BHU267/0, BHU800/1, BBU269/0, and BHU273/0). Each SNP had a read-depth allele frequency &gt;0.978 within this group and a frequency &lt;0.04 in the other strains not in this group. These SNPs coincided with a distinct chromosome copy number pattern in this group. Ref is the reference genome BPK282/0cl4 allele and Var is the observed derived one. (<b>j</b>)\u00a0Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and SNP density across chromosomes in the core population. LD was computed as the r<sup>2</sup> values between SNP pairs. SD is the standard deviation. The number of homozygous (hom) and heterozygous (het) mutations per chromosome across all 191 samples is shown. LD was markedly higher for chromosome 31, and lower for 1, 6, 7, 8 and 10. The number of recombinant pairs was largest on chr31 (469), which had the highest somy level and was the most SNP-dense chromosome. (<b>k</b>) A genomic map of SNPs in the core population whose ancestry could be assigned to a population. Using the 191x6 ChromoPainter model, the 610 ancestry-informative SNPs were examined to highlight those with probabilities of being donated given ISC group was &gt;0.4: ISC2 (gold), ISC3 (grey), ISC4 (red), ISC5 (green), ISC6 (blue) and ISC7 (light blue). The representative samples used for the 191x6 ChromoPainter model were BD09 (ISC2), NEP123/6 (ISC3), BPK087/0cl1 (ISC4), BPK275/0cl18 (ISC5), BPK282/0cl4 (ISC6) and BHU200/0 (ISC7). SNPs with probabilities &lt;0.4 are uncoloured. For chr32 and chr35, most recombinant pairs could be attributed to the eight ungrouped hybrid isolates. (<b>l</b>) Number and heterozygosity\u00a0of ancestry-informative SNPs per isolate. The number of homozygous (hom) and heterozygous\u00a0(het) SNPs distinguishing each core sample (191 total) from six representative samples from each genetically distinct ISC population: ISC2 (BD09), ISC3 (NEP123/6), ISC4 (BPK087/0cl1), ISC5 (BPK275/0cl18), ISC6 (BPK282/0cl4) and ISC7 (BHU200/0). There were 610 informative SNPs with an ancestry probability threshold &gt;0.4. The relative ratio of homozygous and heterozygous SNPs denoted the genetic relatedness of the strains. Samples possessing recent common ancestry with the representative strains had few homozygous SNPs but the same rate of heterozygous SNPs compared to other representative samples. Similarly, samples possessing recent common ancestry with multiple representative samples had fewer homozygous SNPs and no change in the heterozygous SNPs. This was apparent for highlighted ungrouped samples BHU815/0, BHU764A1, BHU274/0, BHU574cl4, BHU581cl2, BHU572cl3 (all ISC5/6/7: green and blue); and BHU744/0, BHU774/0 (ISC6/7: blue). In many groups haplotype segments were shared across isolates widely separated in sampling date. For example, in ISC3, 35 haplotype segments were shared between NEP123/6 (2004), BPK507/0 (December 2009), BPK515/0, BPK518/0 and BPK519/0 (all February 2010); 53 haplotype segments were shared between BPK157/0cl5 (October 2002) and BPK602/0 (February 2011) (both ISC9); 44 between BPK280/0 (August 2003) and BPK615/0 (March 2011; both ungrouped); 31 between BHU274/0 (ungrouped, August 2007) with BHU1199/0 (ISC9, November 2010). (<b>m</b>) Distribution of copying probabilities of SNPs in two representative isolates. Expected copying probabilities from Chromopainter assigning ancestry to SNPs from BHU581/0 (Ungrouped, left) and BPK275/0cl18 (ISC5, right) using probabilities derived from a model assigning SNP ancestry to representative samples from ISC2/3/4/5/6/7. Each column shows the percentage of SNPs assigned to each percentage probability of being donated from each population (eg ISC2) for a particular sample (eg BHU581/0). If many SNPs had high probabilities of being donated from a particular population, this implied that sample shared a recent ancestor with that population. BHU581/0 was a putative ISC5/6/7 hybrid, and had 9.4% of its SNPs with ancestry from ISC6 or ISC7, 7.2% from ISC7, and 10.9% from ISC5. In contrast, BPK275/0cl18 was the representative sample for ISC5, and 44.3% of its SNPs had confident ancestry from ISC5. No SNPs from any comparison were assigned probabilities between 50\u201395%, hence these rows are omitted from the table. These ancestry patterns indicated that BPK035/0cl1-BPK043/0cl2, BHU1011/0-BHU770/0cl1, BPK280/0-BPK615/0 and BPK158/0cl9 represented ISC4-related isolates but not mixtures. BHU774/0 and BHU744/0, showed evidence of both ISC6- and ISC7-derived segments. The six ungrouped samples (BHU274/0, BHU815/0, BHU764/0cl1, BHU574cl4, BHU572cl3 and BHU581cl2) were sampled between February 2007 and February 2010 and had high numbers of heterozygous SNPs. High heterozygosity could be symptomatic of genetically distinct parents in a hybrid. For example, if BHU572cl3 and BHU581cl2 (both May 2009) were mixes of ISC5 (BHU573/0, May 2009) and ISC7 (BHU200/0, July 2006) then only 16 out of 280 genotypes (BHU572cl3) and 15 out of 278 genotypes (BHU581cl2) would be unexplained. This was evaluated for different haplotype sharing options and matched the timing of samples (BHU572cl3, BHU574cl4 and BHU581cl2 in relation to BHU573/0; BHU815/0 in relation to BHU816/0). SNPs assigned to populations with a high probability in the 191x6 model provided a framework for predicting strain membership as well as admixture. Comparing the relative difference in distributions of homozygous and heterozygous SNPs between candidate parents within the sample set was sufficient to identify shared ancestry where related lineages were sampled, and visible in the aligned genotypes of the six strains with segments of both ISC5 and ISC6 ancestry. (<b>n</b>) Percentage of haplotype segment copies shared within and between groups. Recipients are shown as columns and donors as rows. Groups with complex ancestries received more segments than they donated: ISC8 from ISC5, ISC6 and ISC7; ISC3, ISC9 and ISC10 from ISC5. These 'recipient' groups were also associated with long external branch lengths in phylogenies. The expected probability per SNP in each population for the 191x191 co-ancestry analysis indicated that strains assigned to populations by Structure were assigned the same one with FineStructure (ISC2/3/4/5/6/7): ISC2 (copying probability &gt;99%), ISC3 (&gt;97%), ISC4 (&gt;98%), ISC5 (&gt;99%), ISC6 (&gt;90%) and ISC7 (&gt;97%). Genetically heterogeneous groups showed a higher rate of segments were received than donated from specific populations: ISC8 from ISC5 (11.3% vs 1.7%), ISC6 (16.6% vs 4.7%) and ISC7 (16.5% vs 6.2%). ISC9 (10.0% vs 0.8%) and ISC10 also received more from ISC5 (11.1% vs 2.5%). ISC5 also donated more to ISC3 (11.0% v 1.9%) suggesting possible ancestral genetic exchange, which may be associated with the long branch lengths leading to ISC3. (<b>o</b>) Four-gamete test for recombination. Four gamete tests showed evidence of recombination in the core population and ISC1. 2043 from 117,055 (1.75%) SNP pairs had a recombination signature in the core population. For the subset of 2,015 SNPs with no missing data R=0.7/Mb. The 8 hybrids were BHU815/0, BHU764A1, BHU274/0, BHU574cl4, BHU581cl2, BHU572cl3 (all ISC5+ISC6/7), BHU744/0 and BHU774/0 (both ISC6/7 only). Recombination\u00a0was evident at 25% of SNPs in ISC1 (184,827 out of 739,581 SNP pairs) based on the four gamete test. This signature varied over 13-fold from chr31 (54.2% of pairs) to chr23 (4%). (<b>p</b>)\u00a0SNP and indel association with Sb<sup>V</sup> resistance. Fisher exact tests evaluated the association of Sb<sup>V</sup>-resistance with SNPs (coded as the number of derived mutations: 0, 1 or 2) and indels (coded as the diploid number of inserted or deleted (-) basepairs). (<b>q</b>) SNP association with in-vitro SSG phenotype.\u00a0SNPs with derived alleles in multiple ISC groups with 6+ non-reference genotypes for which the absolute difference in SSG-R and SSG-S allele frequency was &gt;0.1 with the OR (odds ratio) &gt;4 and Benjamini-Hochberg-Yekutieli corrected t-test p value &lt;0.005. SNPs are ordered by chromosome\u00a0and position. The SSG phenotypes were assessed as ln(EC50) values for the derived (D) and reference (R) alleles. To avoid arbitrarily categorising the sample in vitro Sb<sup>V</sup> phenotypes as R and S using a given threshold\u00a0EC50 value, we compared the log-scaled EC50 values of each allele pair at the 57 SNPs identified using t-tests (p&lt;0.005): the Sb<sup>V</sup>-R alleles had log-scaled EC50 values of 1.13\u20131.84 compared to S ones of 0.01\u20130.50 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Consequently, the 57 SNPs together have power to differentiate\u00a0Sb<sup>V</sup>-R and Sb<sup>V</sup>-S phenotypes. (<b>r</b>)\u00a0SNP association with clinical outcome from SSG treatment. SNPs with derived alleles in multiple ISC groups with 6+ non-reference genotypes\u00a0for which the absolute difference in SSG-cure and SSG-failure allele frequency was\u00a0&gt;0.1 with the OR (odds ratio) &gt;4. The SNPs are ordered by chromosome and position. The SSG phenotypes\u00a0were assessed for the derived (D) and reference (R) alleles. We examined lines for which the patient was treated with SSG and was either cured (n=21) or treatment failed (n=14: death, relapse, no response to treatment) to test a null hypothesis that SSG outcome and SNPs were unlinked.\u00a0An\u00a0alternative\u00a0hypothesis was that SSG-cure patients could be infected with Sb<sup>V</sup>-S parasites, and SSG-fail with Sb<sup>V</sup>-R (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). 32 SNPs were associated with SSG cure (OR&gt;4), including 11 nonsynonymous\u00a0SNPs, but none at a significant level due to the small sample size. (<b>s</b>) Relative strength of purifying selection between ISC populations. Relative strength of purifying selection between ISC populations (columns 1 and 2) as ascertained as the relative rate of accumulation of derived alleles computed as R for all (top), nonsynonymous (middle) and synonymous (bottom) sites. We tested for differential selective pressures among the ISC groups where observed values of R\u00a0statistics deviated by at least four standard errors (SE) from the expected value of 1 (Do et al 2015). The genome-wide values are shown along with the weighted block jackknife confidence\u00a0intervals (lower, median, upper). Derived alleles were more frequent in ISC4 than ISC5, suggesting\u00a0stronger purifying selection\u00a0in ISC5. Comparing ISC2 (Bangladesh) to ISC3-7 (Nepal/India), we found a genome-wide (RG) excess of derived alleles had accumulated in the latter (RG=0.74, 6.15*SE). This\u00a0was not directly attributable to selection because the difference was present in both nonsynonymous\u00a0(RN=0.59, 4.42*SE) or synonymous sites (RS=0.66, 10.82*SE). ISC3/4/5/6 shared genetic ancestors dating to approximately the same origin, so a comparison of their rates should indicate variation in the relative accrual of derived alleles. Despite possessing the largest sample size (n=52) of all ISC populations, ISC5 gained significantly fewer derived alleles genome-wide compared\u00a0to ISC3 (RG=0.75, 11.39*SE), ISC4 (RG=0.65, 7.37*SE) and to a lesser extent, ISC6 (RG=0.82, 3.38*SE). This trend was present in both nonsynonymous and synonymous SNPs but not significant\u00a0for most comparisons\u00a0(an exception was comparing synonymous changes in ISC5 vs ISC4 (RS=0.37, 7.80*SE). Similarly, the rate of accumulation\u00a0of homozygous derived SNPs (R2 values) was higher in ISC4 relative to ISC5 (R2G=0.90, 3.87*SE). Antimonial in vitro resistance was highest in ISC5 (ln[EC50]=1.38 \u00b1 1.45) and lowest in ISC4 (0.13 \u00b1 1.12). Consequently, the relative difference in the rate of accumulation\u00a0of derived alleles in ISC5 that was predominantly isolated in India may reflect different exposure to drug selection compared\u00a0to ISC4 (mainly from Nepal). Further work is required to quantify\u00a0this in relation to variable antimonial resistance levels among samples in each\u00a0population. ISC7 was a genetic subgroup of ISC6 that may be a recent radiation or have undergone\u00a0a substantial\u00a0population\u00a0bottleneck. No genome-wide difference was evident in terms of selction,\u00a0but fewer derived synonymous\u00a0SNPs were found in ISC6 (RS=2.18, 4.44*SE), suggestive stronger\u00a0hitchhiking\u00a0of alleles in ISC7. (<b>t</b>) Multi-allelic sites. Sites with multiple derived alleles compared to reference genome sample\u00a0BPK282/0cl4 in the core population (7, top) and ISC1 (10, bottom)."

There are probably between 200,000 and 300,000 VL cases annually (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alvar et al., 2012</a>), leading to as many as 50,000 deaths per year (<a href=\"#bib15\">den Boer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lozano et al., 2012</a>). VL is widespread in both the New and Old Worlds (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pigott et al., 2014</a>), but as much as 80% of the global VL burden occurs in the Indian sub-continent (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alvar et al., 2012</a>). Recent intensified control efforts have led to a notable decline in cases (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chowdhury et al., 2014</a>) but the problem is not yet eliminated. VL is a key neglected tropical disease, affecting the poorest regions of the world and the poorest communities within these regions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boelaert et al., 2009</a>). VL was first reported in the Indian sub-continent (ISC) in the 1820s, but initially confused with malaria until the discovery of <i>L. donovani</i> in 1903 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gibson, 1983</a>). Although VL was nearly eliminated from the ISC in the 1960s (<a href=\"#bib75\">Thakur, 2007</a>) by antimalarial spraying campaigns with DDT, it re-emerged in 1977 and has caused several subsequent major epidemics (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dye and Wolpert, 1988</a>). Widespread chemotherapy for VL in the region has been ongoing since the 1820s, initially with quinine and other drugs, followed by extensive use of the trivalent antimonial Sb<sup>III</sup> (1915) and compounds of the less toxic pentavalent Sb<sup>V</sup> (1922) such as sodium stibogluconate (SSG), and since 2005 with miltefosine (MIL) that is freely supplied through a government-subsidized control program. The parasite developed resistance to both Sb<sup>III</sup> and Sb<sup>V</sup>, and after ten years of clinical use there has been a notable decline in MIL efficacy (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rijal et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Sundar et al., 2012</a>)."

However, there is little data on the diversity of clinical <i>Leishmania</i> populations or how they evolve during treatment. While an extensive literature has made use of molecular methods to study the population genetics of <i>Leishmania</i> (e.g. <a href=\"#bib2\">Alam et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lukes et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mauricio et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Schonian et al., 2008</a>), existing genetic markers have relatively poor resolution, and in particular <i>L. donovani</i> within the ISC show very little genetic differentiation based on these approaches (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alam et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Downing et al., 2012</a>).

These include sporadic gene duplication, dynamic tandem gene array sizes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and long sub-telomeric amplifications/deletions, the latter generally spanning whole transcription units. While structural variation in <i>Leishmania</i> is often considered a transient adaptation, particularly to culture conditions in vitro, we find striking conservation of many CNVs across all core population groups here. Two multigenic intra-chromosomal duplicated regions (MAPK1 and H-locus;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib19\">Downing et al., 2011</a>) are present in variable numbers in all core population isolates but are absent in ISC1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,c</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Conserved heterozygous SNPs in both of these structural variants confirm that these regions have duplicated once and been maintained throughout the evolution of this population. All known genes on these duplicated regions are associated with virulence (MAPK1, ASS, sAcP; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fernandes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lakhal-Naouar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Wiese, 1998</a>) or drug resistance (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brotherton et al., 2013</a>), indicating that extensive structural variation allows these parasites to alter local copy number in response to changing environments: both aneuploidy and CNV regulate gene expression (<a href=\"#bib39\">Leprohon et al., 2009</a>). Most isolates are aneuploid (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), even excluding the generally tetrasomic chromosome 31, and almost all chromosomes show some variation in somy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). Aneuploidy (r<sup>2</sup>=0.15, p=2.7x10<sup>-118</sup>), CNVs (r<sup>2</sup>=0.26, p=7.5x10<sup>-218</sup>) and indels (r<sup>2</sup>=0.30, p=2.1x10<sup>-254</sup>) are significantly correlated with SNP variation in the core isolates, suggesting that these variants have appeared gradually during the evolution of the population in the field. Most strikingly, we find two cases of recent epidemic expansions associated with major changes in aneuploidy and heterozygosity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Variation in somy can thus lead to changes in heterozygosity, which could allow selection to eradicate recessive deleterious mutations in the absence of recombination (<a href=\"#bib66\">Roze and Michod, 2010</a>)."

We find three other independent frameshifts in AQP1 gene in other antimony resistant isolates, including one in BPK181/12 (ISC6), an isolate taken from a patient following failure of ten months of antimony treatment that was absent in the pre-treatment isolate from the same patient (BPK181/ 0cl11, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

The ISC5 lineage emerged following the end of the DDT campaigns but then proliferated quickly in the 1970s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c,d</a>), when antimonial dosage had to be doubled because of its declining efficacy. The persistence of this lineage beyond the era of Sb treatment perhaps reflects the increased fitness (<a href=\"#bib78\">Vanaerschot et al., 2013</a>) of Sb-resistant parasites. These observations tally with a stronger signature of purifying selection on the ISC5 lineage, measured as a lower rate of derived allele accumulation compared to other ISC populations, which may be a consequence of higher historical exposure to drug stress (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2, table s</a>). Sb resistance is also present in other genetic groups, with 4 out of 15 ISC4 lines tested in vitro being Sb<sup>V</sup>-R, indicating resistance has emerged independently and recently multiple times in ISC <i>L. donovani</i>, and that other genetic variants responsible for Sb<sup>V</sup> resistance must be present in this population. Indeed, other Sb<sup>V</sup> resistance mechanisms are known in this population: previous work has shown that two resistant strains from ISC4 (BPK087 and BPK190) show significantly decreased transcription of an AQP1 locus encoding a wildtype protein sequence (<a href=\"#bib13\">Decuypere et al., 2005</a>), and BHU764 combines a different indel mutation in AQP1 and reduced expression of MRPA, an efflux transporter of Sb<sup>III</sup> (<a href=\"#bib52\">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2011</a>). The failure of any single resistance locus to sweep through this population may reflect the low level of gene flow and the presence of a large reservoir of untreated asymptomatic cases (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ostyn et al., 2011</a>)."

COCALL applied five different variant detection approaches and combines evidence from them to calculate the support for each genotype. For complete details on the algorithm testing and development, see Appendix 1. In short, this approach avoids bias associated with systematic errors unique to each individual SNP caller by examining their consistency and identifying discordant mutations symptomatic of false positives. The five callers used were FreeBayes v0.9.5, GATK 2.0\u201338, Samtools Pileup v0.1.16 and Mpileup v0.1.18 based on the DNA read mapping by Smalt, and Cortex v1.0.5.13 based on its own <i>de novo</i> assembly and mapping. In a large population of genetically homogenous strains, superior inference power was achieved by examining the population-wide genotype at each candidate SNP site (i.e. population-based COCALL; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Candidate SNPs with genotype qualities of 40+ across all five callers were retained. SNPs with population normalized read depth \u22640.5 or \u22651.75 or with multiple derived alleles across the five callers were excluded. Candidate SNPs in soft-masked regions were accepted where the number of callers \u22653.5; those in non-masked regions were kept where the number of callers \u22652.5. SNP sites retained in the final set of retained SNP sites were supported by a mean of 4.5 callers out of 5."

Somy levels were estimated as the median normalized chromosomal read depths (<a href=\"#bib19\">Downing et al., 2011</a>). Local copy number variants (CNVs) were detected where the local read depth was significantly different from the median depth of approximately 60 samples from ICS4, ISC6 and ISC8 whose depth profile is similar to that of BPK282/0cl4, and were measured with respect to the haploid depth to exclude somy variability. Two CNVs in particular, the MAPK1 and H-locus, were further investigated as they show functions potentially relevant to parasite adaptation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Downing et al., 2011</a>). A quantitative PCR assay in a subset of 46 samples was performed to confirm the copy number variation of the MAPK1 and H-locus amplicons. The nature of the amplification (extra- or intra-chromosomal) was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and southern blot hybridization comparing two strains that showed differential amplification of these loci (ISC6 strain BPK282/0cl4: amplification; and ISC1 strain BPK026/0cl5: no amplification). To exclude the possibility that the amplicons are a culturing artefact, PCRs using primers that enabled amplification of circular episomes or tandem duplications was also attempted directly on five bone marrow samples from VL patients. Indels were detected using a consensus calling method based on the concordance of results across four tools: Cortex, Freebayes, GATK and Samtools Mpileup.

Dates for each were fixed to the month of isolation, with sampling dates for those for which only isolation year data was available estimated during the MCMC but given a uniform prior on sampling ages within that year. Broadly consistent date estimates were obtained under three different models: with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model and a TVM substitution model and a Bayesian skyride model for population sizes, under the same model but with a strict clock model and finally under a GTR substitution model, with a simple constant population size coalescent model for data including the outgroups. Migration rate estimates were obtained by including a simple continuous-time Markov model of a discrete trait representing the country (Nepal/India) of isolation, so that ancestral states and rates of change in geographical location were estimated along the phylogeny. All analyses were made with a minimum of 8 independent MCMC runs, for 200 million update generations per run. Convergence was assessed by inspection in Tracer v1.6, confirming that at least 5 of the 8 runs had converged to the same stationary distribution of parameters and that this had the highest likelihood. In most analyses, seven or eight chains all converged to the same posterior distribution, but the Bayesian skyride analyses converged more slowly. ESS estimates for almost all parameters across runs was over 500, except for some skyride population size parameters. The first 20 million generations of each MCMC run were removed before combining all converged runs for inference.

In contrast, the value of f<sub>4</sub>(A,B,C,D) does depend on the evolutionary history of populations A, B, C and D and so can be used to test a proposed relationship: if the four populations are related as ((A,B),(C,D)) the f<sub>4</sub> statistic is expected to be zero; for ((A,C),(B,D)) it is expected to be positive and for ((A,D),(B,C)), negative.

Groups of SNPs on a single chromosome were expected to be exchanged as blocks of different sizes, so a higher number and longer lengths of shared blocks indicate recent common ancestry. The most likely ancestral sample or population was assigned according to its similarity to corresponding segments in a set of donor isolates. Two main datasets were generated by ChromoPainter: a co-ancestry matrix where all 191 could donate to all 191 as recipients (191x191), and another where six representative samples were used as the only donors (191x6: BD09 for ISC2, BPK067/0cl2 for ISC3, BPK087/0cl11 for ISC4, BPK275/0cl18 for ISC5, BPK282/0cl4 for ISC6, BHU200/0 for ISC7).

Links between genetic diversity (SNP, indel, CNV and somy) and in vitro\u00a0Sb<sup>V</sup>-resistance were assessed using the Fisher Exact test (FET), Mann Whitney U-tests (MWU) and odds ratios (ORs), implemented on 103 CNVs and 17 indels (in 14 genes) as well as 2,392 phased SNPs genotypes. SNPs were assigned to the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 UTR if they were within 1 kb of the start or end of the gene (respectively). To counter bias associated with the small sample size, FET and MWU were used initially. For the FET, variants were defined as discrete variables: SNPs as 0, 1 or 2 non-reference alleles, and small indels as the diploid number of inserted or deleted basepairs. For the MWU, mutations were considered as a continuous variable such that the somy state was the haploid chromosome state, and CNVs were the haploid copy number times the somy state. The null hypothesis was that there were no significant genetic differences between Sb<sup>V</sup>-R and Sb<sup>V</sup>-S strains (subject to p&lt;0.01). The FETs and MWU were limited by the partial association of different mutations with the phenotypes, so we examined ORs of the derived alleles segregating in multiple ISC populations with 6+ non-reference alleles for which the absolute difference in Sb<sup>V</sup>-R and Sb<sup>V</sup>-S allele frequencies &gt;0.1 using the log-scaled EC50 values. We compared the log-scaled EC50 values of each allele pair using t-tests."

Stronger purifying selection should purge deleterious derived alleles more quickly, detected as an excess of nonsynonymous changes relative to synonymous ones, as previously observed for ISC isolates (<a href=\"#bib19\">Downing et al., 2011</a>). This signature should be most apparent for derived alleles, which should accumulate at a net rate dependent on the historical effective population sizes and selective coefficients. Using <i>L. infantum</i> JPCM5 as the outgroup, the relative abundance of derived alleles in one population that were absent in the other for each ISC population pair (ISC2-7) were determined as the statistic R (<a href=\"#bib18\">Do et al., 2015</a>). The associated ratio R2 denoted the relative rate of homozygous derived allele accumulation between populations. R and R2 should approximate 1 assuming no difference in the strength of selection, and primarily depend on the derived allele frequency per population, so the main confounder was variance in historical effective population sizes among ISC populations. To calculate confidence intervals for these R values that take into account correlation between neighbouring sites, we used a Weighted Block Jackknife by splitting the SNPs according to chromosome (<a href=\"#bib9\">Busing et al., 1999</a>) to counter the extensive linkage disequilibrium between SNPs (<a href=\"#bib50\">Moorjani et al., 2011</a>): discrete chromosomal blocks may still be linked. This was adjusted for the number of SNPs per block to reflect the variability in the relative selective pressure (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kunsch, 1989</a>). A threshold of four times the standard error of these jackknife estimates was used as a criteria for identifying comparisons deviating significantly from expected values (<a href=\"#bib18\">Do et al., 2015</a>)."

The main premise was that no SNP caller was <i>a priori</i> superior, and that errors among calling tools tended to differ across sites, whereas true variants showed a concordant signal. This approach avoided systematic errors unique to each individual SNP caller by examining their consistency and identifying discordant mutations symptomatic of false positives\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib79\">Weisenfeld et al., 2014</a>). These disparities among callers arise from their differing strategies for tackling repetitive regions, ambiguous read mapping probabilities and alignments, low complexity regions, tandem repeats, inversions, translocations and regions in which genuine repeats are collapsed in the reference assembly. By combining this with population-level information to scale the prior probability of a mutation existing at a known SNP site, COCALL is optimised for variant discovery in a largely unknown population. This integrated variant discovery scheme inferred sample genotypes both dependently and independently of other samples, which may mitigate bias in rare variant discovery: dependent approaches miss true SNPs and independent ones include many false positives\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Han et al., 2014</a>). COCALL was particularly effective when samples were genetically homogenous and the sequence quality and read depth among samples was uniform, as in this study. When these conditions were not met, COCALL was less effective, and population-based methods implemented in GATK, Freebayes or Samtools Mpileup performed better because these methods identified base variations based on aggregated depth across the population, and were less affected by lower quality sequence runs. Computational time for running COCALL may become prohibitively long for samples with high genetic diversity."

We calculated Ti/Tv ratios for variants in the core population of 191 (plus one additional closely related sample, BHU1087/0). We find that SNP calls supported by multiple callers had higher Ti/Tv ratios (<a href=\"#A1-tbl6\">Table A1.6</a>), with the highest ratio for SNPs called by all five callers (2.74). Ti/Tv ratios consistently differed between singletons, doubletons and non-rare variants regardless of SNP caller: for SNPs called by all five methods, non-rare variants had higher rates (Ti/Tv=7267/1914=3.80) than doubletons (558/298=1.87) or singletons (1316/1124=1.17), as expected if singleton variants are more likely to be false positives. Ti/Tv ratios of non-rare SNPs were much higher than singleton SNPs across SNP sets called by Cortex-Mpileup (3.61 vs 0.91), Cortex-Pileup (3.08 vs 0.79), Cortex-GATK (2.26 vs 0.53), and Cortex-Freebayes (1.51 vs 0.40). While non-protozoan inter-species comparisons find a Ti/Tv ratio of 2.0\u20132.1 for genome-wide datasets and 3.0\u20133.3 for coding SNPs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib23\">Ebersberger et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Freudenberg-Hua et al., 2003</a>), we find higher Ti/Tv ratios at non-coding regions than coding regions, irrespective of SNP caller(s) used. Moreover, this effect was higher for high-confidence SNPs such as those called by all five callers and those present in multiple isolates. For example, for SNPs called by all five calling tools, all variants: coding Ti/Tv=4154/1736=2.39 vs non-coding 4987/1600=3.12; non-rare SNPs: coding 3285/1033=3.18 vs non-coding 3982/881=4.52; singleton SNPs: coding 617/565=1.09 vs non-coding 699/559=1.15."

Therefore we used three different depth thresholds: for CNVs of 2 to 5 kb, the threshold was five times the standard deviation of the chromosomal depth; for CNVs of 5 to 20 kb, the threshold was three times this value; for CNVs of &gt;20 kb, the threshold was 1.5 times this value."

In the present study, each read was mapped to its most similar region in the reference, and where reads could be mapped with equal mapping scores to multiple locations, one position was selected randomly to quantify read depth, in contrast to the previous study in which read depth was under-estimated by only using uniquely-mapped reads (<a href=\"#bib65\">Rogers et al., 2011</a>). A threshold of 1.5 times the haploid depth was used to identify duplicated genes (a more conservative threshold of 2.0 did not change results materially). This threshold of 1.5 was effective for Illumina Hiseq data, where fluctuations in read depth were smaller than those previously seen using the Illumina Genome Analyser II. To illustrate this, the normalised standard deviation (standard deviation divided by average chromosome depth) of 17 strains sequenced by Genome Analyser II in was 0.32 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Downing et al., 2011</a>), and in the current analysis, using Illumina Hiseq 2000 data, this was 0.19. We were therefore able to quantify more subtle depth variation than previous analyses. To normalise for differences in chromosome lengths, the number of duplicated genes was expressed per unit chromosome with a length set to that of chromosome 1. Results from between-species analysis\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib65\">Rogers et al., 2011</a>) have previously suggested a link between somy variation and copy number variation. However, in the present study, the correlation of duplicated genes per chromosome with the somy level was statistically significant but the effect size was very small (n=7146 chromosomes, r<sup>2</sup>=0.027, p=7.03x10<sup>-46</sup>), suggesting no relationship or only a weak one, between somy level and copy number at the population level."

These platforms differ in read length (76-base reads rather than 100-base reads) and differ in both the polymerase error rate and sequencing throughput, reflected in lower read coverage available for these isolates in 2011. In addition, the variant detection algorithms developed at that time (pre-2011) were focused on accurate SNP-calling, and we used an off-the-shelf approach implemented in the samtools package for identifying indels that are now thought to be prone to generating ambiguous putative indels as the now standard approach of locally re-aligning reads near indel positions was not established at that time. Our new study directly addresses this limitation by applying an independent de novo assembler (Cortex) to improve indel detection and verification by local read re-alignment. In addition, it applies a superior read-mapping approach with Smalt that has a much reduced error rate compared to the 2011 implementation with Ssaha2. We also augmented the Cortex-based approach with indel calling for individual libraries with Samtools Mpileup, for populations with GATK, and using a distinct alignment algorithm with FreeBayes. The combination of many more ISC5 samples and better sequencing and analysis technology has allowed us to detect this very small indel."

The data shown in the Southern blot (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) is not supporting an increase in copy number of 20-30. One would even expect a change in size of the chromosome if they were that many intrachromosomal amplification. A control probe would be helpful. A minor point in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (they discuss about episome, rather than intrachromosomal amplification)."

If the amplicon was extra-chromosomal, on an episome, we would expect to see a second, much lower band hybridizing with the MPK1 probe, as in panel D of the same figure. We agree that this kind of Southern blot experiment (without controls) is not quantitative, but we are not concerned that these results are in contradiction to our estimated increase in copy number. The MPK1 locus is approximately 15 kb, so the 15 repeats per haploid genome we estimate in BPK282 (around 15) would correspond to around 225 kb, only 8% the length of the 2.7 Mb chromosome 36. In the gels shown in panels A and B, this large chromosome migrates to the so-called compression zone of OFAGE gels where the largest chromosomes co-migrate and where it would be impossible to observe even fairly substantial differences in chromosome size. We think copy number is estimated both far more precisely and more accurately by looking at the depth of ilumina reads mapping to this feature than by looking at either the intensity of hybridization or lengths of molecules migrating on a gel."
