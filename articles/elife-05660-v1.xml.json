Current models suggest that synaptojanin activity is tightly associated with endophilin through high-affinity binding between the synaptojanin proline-rich domain (PRD) and the endophilin SH3 domain. Surprisingly, we find that truncated synaptojanin lacking the PRD domain sustains normal synaptic transmission, indicating that synaptojanin's core function <i>in vivo</i> resides in the remaining two domains that contain phosphoinositide phosphatase activities: an N-terminal Sac1 phosphatase domain and a 5-phosphatase domain. We further show that the Sac1 domain plays an unexpected role in targeting synaptojanin to synapses. The requirement for Sac1 is bypassed by tethering the synaptojanin 5-phophatase to the endophilin membrane-bending BAR domain. Together, our results uncover an unexpected role for the Sac1 domain <i>in vivo</i> in supporting coincident action between synaptojanin and endophilin at synapses."
