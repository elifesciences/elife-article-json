As a component of the SC lateral element, SYCP3 has a critical role in defining the specific chromosome architecture required for correct meiotic progression. In the model, the reported compaction of chromosomal DNA caused by SYCP3 would result from its ability to bridge distant sites on a DNA molecule with the DNA-binding domains located at each end of its strut-like structure. Here, we describe a single-molecule assay based on optical tweezers, fluorescence microscopy and microfluidics that, in combination with bulk biochemical data, provides direct visual evidence for our proposed mechanism of SYCP3-mediated chromosome organisation."

As a component of the SC lateral element, SYCP3 has a critical role in defining the specific chromosome architecture required for correct meiotic progression. In the model, the reported compaction of chromosomal DNA caused by SYCP3 would result from its ability to bridge distant sites on a DNA molecule with the DNA-binding domains located at each end of its strut-like structure. Here, we describe a single-molecule assay based on optical tweezers, fluorescence microscopy and microfluidics that, in combination with bulk biochemical data, provides direct visual evidence for our proposed mechanism of SYCP3-mediated chromosome organisation."

Morphologically, the SC is composed of three parts: lateral elements, transverse filaments and a central element. Lateral elements are protein scaffolds that extend along the entire length of each chromosome axis. They become linked together by transverse filaments, which connect the chromosomes in a homologous pair to the midline central element, to induce chromosome synapsis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sch\u00fccker et al., 2015</a>). The tripartite SC ultra-structure provides an essential three-dimensional scaffold for meiotic progression and its absence or defective formation can lead to failure of meiotic progression and infertility (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bolcun-Filas et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">de Vries et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hamer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Schramm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Yang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Yuan et al., 2000</a>)."

SYCP3 is regarded as an important architectural component of the lateral element, and its disruption in mice has consequences for the morphology and structural integrity of the meiotic chromosome: in SYCP3-deficient mice, the chromosome axis is twice the length of that in wild-type mice and cohesin disassembles prematurely (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kouznetsova et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Yuan et al., 2002</a>)."

The experiment is performed in a multi-channel laminar flow cell that allows tethering of DNA to optically-trapped beads and moving the tethered DNA to parallel laminar-flow lanes containing, for example, the fluorescently-labelled components to be analysed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

We hypothesise that the diffusive binding mode reflects the interaction with the extended \u03bb DNA of a single DNA-binding domain at one end of the rigid SYCP3 strut, allowing SYCP3 to slide along the DNA molecule (first-binding mode). Upon relaxation of the DNA substrate, DNA-bound SYCP3 would engage concurrently a distinct DNA site with its other DNA-binding domain, in a bridging interaction leading to formation of a DNA loop (second binding-mode). This transient juxtaposition of distinct DNA segments would facilitate bivalent DNA interactions of neighbouring SYCP3 molecules, stabilising the DNA loop and leading to the formation of a static cluster of DNA-bound SYCP3 molecules. Consistent with the presence of SYCP3-dependent loops in the DNA that might resist extension, higher forces were required to extend \u03bb DNA after the compaction step relative to naked DNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In our experiments, SYCP3-dependent DNA bridges did not exhibit extensive and distinct bond-rupture events (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), as previously observed for DNA-bridging proteins H-NS and Alba1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dame et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Laurens et al., 2012</a>). The lack of pronounced rupture events suggests a comparatively high stability of SYCP3-compacted DNA, although further quantitative analysis would require quadruple optical trapping experiments (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heller et al., 2016</a>)."

All other data in this work has been acquired at 6.4 \u00b5W laser power. Since the bleaching/unbinding rate at 2.9 \u00b5W laser power is reduced by a factor of 10 compared to that at 6.4 \u00b5W, we conclude that at 6.4 \u00b5W the experiment is limited by photobleaching.

After correction for bleaching (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we determined that the SYCP3 cluster size was distributed around a mean value of 67 tetramers per cluster, with individual clusters showing a range of 20 to 160 tetramers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

Such a mechanism of DNA compaction, driven by the reduced entropic penalty of successive DNA-bridging events, has been predicted by molecular dynamics studies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brackley et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cheng et al., 2015</a>). Apparently cooperative DNA-binding behavior of DNA-bridging proteins has been attributed to the induced proximity of distinct protein-bound DNA sites in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dame et al., 2006</a>). The observed footprint size of SYCP3, corresponding approximately to one helical turn of DNA, is similar to that of the DNA-bridging protein H-NS that was found to bridge two parallel DNA molecules in register with the helical repeat (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dame et al., 2006</a>). A preferential DNA-binding orientation correlated to the DNA helix is further supported by the observed value of the 1D-diffusion constant of SYCP3, which is in good agreement with rotation-coupled 1D-sliding along the DNA helix (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blainey et al., 2009</a>)."

The number of photons emitted per Alexa555 fluorophore was determined by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the summed rows of intensities in the bleaching step of a stable SYCP3 cluster. 34 bleaching steps in 10 DNA molecules were analysed in total. The average decrease in amplitude of the Gaussian fit associated with bleaching of a single Alexa555 was 1.5 photons (per confocal scan-line).

The total intensity in photons per pixel over the length of \u03bb DNA (I<sub>total</sub>) was measured at the start of the kymograph (time t\u00a0=\u00a00) and at a time point when stable clusters had formed (time t), and the ratio I<sub>total,t=0</sub>/I<sub>total,t</sub> was used as the bleaching correction factor. The correction makes the assumption that the observed reduction in fluorescence was caused by bleaching, with no dissociation of SYCP3 from the DNA in the experiment. Indeed, under experimental conditions of 6.4 \u00b5W excitation intensity, the experiment is dominated by bleaching, with a typical rate of 5\u00b710<sup>\u22125</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00b710<sup>\u22125</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> (sd) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The number of SYCP3 tetramers in a stable cluster was determined by fitting a Gaussian distribution to measure its fluorescence intensity, dividing the amplitude of the Gaussian fit by 6.0 to account for the presence of 4 Alexa555 fluorophores in a tetramer and multiplying by the bleaching correction factor. 15 clusters belonging to four different DNA molecules were analysed in total."

In the current manuscript, the authors combine single-molecule optical tweezers, fluorescence spectroscopy and microfluidics to study DNA binding by SYCP3. The ends of this tetrameric protein are shown to bind to and diffuse along DNA. This manuscript shows that multimers of this protein stabilize DNA loops, and suggests that this is done by bridging the sides of DNA loops and stabilizing them. The key quantitative findings of this paper reveal that the binding site size of a single tetramer is 3 nm, and that between 20 and 90 tetramers are found to stabilize each loop."

It should be noted that one reviewer raised serious concerns about the physiological relevance of the observations. However, we feel that the demonstration of DNA looping that was hypothesized in the 2014 paper is a sufficient novel advance to be considered for publication as a Research Advance. Before a decision can be made, a number of key shortcomings should be addressed in a revised manuscript (listed below), however. In particular, it will be necessary to provide additional experimental evidence that verifies the loop formation and growth model presented in the manuscript."

This is inconsistent with the idea that SYCP3 is a major loop-forming protein \u2013 if it were, there would be essentially no axis-loop structure in a SYCP3 mutant, and the chromosomes would be much, much longer. Additionally, a large and growing body of data from cytological, biochemical, and chromosome conformation capture approaches indicates that cohesins bind the base of loops in interphase, mitotic, and meiotic chromosomes. Emerging models also suggest that cohesins actively form the loops, perhaps through an ATP-dependent extrusion activity. SYCP3 is not an ATPase, and simple multivalent DNA binding activity is not sufficient to explain the linear, regular array of loops observed in meiotic chromosomes. In some metazoans, it seems likely that SYCP3 interacts with cohesin-bound DNAs to create regular spacing between the bases of adjacent loops. Alternatively, SYCP3 may impact axis assembly by modulating interactions between cohesins and DNA. The authors should provide more discussion to argue that the evidence in this work implicates SYCP3 as the critical loop-forming protein of the axis, or indeed as a loop-forming protein. The same evidence (that SYCP3 has the ability to simultaneously bind 2 DNA molecules) could be used to argue that the protein mediates synapsis between homologous chromosomes, but it clearly is not in the right place to do this."

This is inconsistent with the idea that SYCP3 is a major loop-forming protein \u2013 if it were, there would be essentially no axis-loop structure in a SYCP3 mutant, and the chromosomes would be much, much longer. Additionally, a large and growing body of data from cytological, biochemical, and chromosome conformation capture approaches indicates that cohesins bind the base of loops in interphase, mitotic, and meiotic chromosomes. Emerging models also suggest that cohesins actively form the loops, perhaps through an ATP-dependent extrusion activity. SYCP3 is not an ATPase, and simple multivalent DNA binding activity is not sufficient to explain the linear, regular array of loops observed in meiotic chromosomes. In some metazoans, it seems likely that SYCP3 interacts with cohesin-bound DNAs to create regular spacing between the bases of adjacent loops. Alternatively, SYCP3 may impact axis assembly by modulating interactions between cohesins and DNA. The authors should provide more discussion to argue that the evidence in this work implicates SYCP3 as the critical loop-forming protein of the axis, or indeed as a loop-forming protein.

However, we believe that this experiment would have only limited physiological relevance, as in the cell nucleus the extent of SYCP3-dependent DNA compaction will be influenced by important protein determinants of chromosome structure such as meiotic cohesin (see for instance, Novak et al., 2008)."
