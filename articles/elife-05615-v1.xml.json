Adipogenic signals activate early adipogenic activators and facilitate the transient formation of early enhanceosomes at target genes. These enhancer regions are subsequently inherited by late enhanceosomes. PPAR\u03b3 is one of the late adipogenic activators and is known as a master regulator of adipogenesis. However, the factors that regulate PPAR\u03b3 expression remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that a novel ubiquitin E3 ligase, tripartite motif protein 23 (TRIM23), stabilizes PPAR\u03b3 protein and mediates atypical polyubiquitin conjugation. TRIM23 knockdown caused a marked decrease in PPAR\u03b3 protein abundance during preadipocyte differentiation, resulting in a severe defect in late adipogenic differentiation, whereas it did not affect the formation of early enhanceosomes. Our results suggest that TRIM23 plays a critical role in the switching from early to late adipogenic enhanceosomes by stabilizing PPAR\u03b3 protein possibly via atypical polyubiquitin conjugation."
