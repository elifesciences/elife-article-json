Sestrins are stress-inducible proteins, which suppress both mTORC1 and ER stress; however, the role of Sestrins in colon physiology and tumorigenesis has been elusive due to the lack of studies in human tissues or in appropriate animal models. In this study, we show that human <i>SESN2</i> expression is elevated in the colon of ulcerative colitis patients but is lost upon p53 inactivation during colon carcinogenesis. In mouse colon, Sestrin2 was critical for limiting ER stress and promoting the recovery of epithelial cells after inflammatory injury. During colitis-promoted tumorigenesis, Sestrin2 was shown to be an important mediator of p53\u2019s control over mTORC1 signaling and tumor cell growth. These results highlight Sestrin2 as a novel tumor suppressor, whose downregulation can accelerate both colitis and colon carcinogenesis."

Sestrins are stress-inducible proteins, which suppress both mTORC1 and ER stress; however, the role of Sestrins in colon physiology and tumorigenesis has been elusive due to the lack of studies in human tissues or in appropriate animal models. In this study, we show that human <i>SESN2</i> expression is elevated in the colon of ulcerative colitis patients but is lost upon p53 inactivation during colon carcinogenesis. In mouse colon, Sestrin2 was critical for limiting ER stress and promoting the recovery of epithelial cells after inflammatory injury. During colitis-promoted tumorigenesis, Sestrin2 was shown to be an important mediator of p53\u2019s control over mTORC1 signaling and tumor cell growth. These results highlight Sestrin2 as a novel tumor suppressor, whose downregulation can accelerate both colitis and colon carcinogenesis."

Inflammation can be elicited in various ways; and intestinal inflammation and colon cancer development are often associated with a protein complex \u2013 called mTORC1 \u2013 being overactive in the tissue. This protein complex has been studied in other contexts and is known to instruct cells to produce more proteins. However, when too much protein is made too quickly, cells cannot carry out their routine quality checks. This, in turn, can lead to unfolded proteins accumulating in the cell, which is stressful and damaging, and can cause inflammation. Increased production of proteins and other biomolecules can also allow the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells."

Colon cancer cells with little or no Sestrin2 were also more resistant to chemotherapy than control cells with normal levels of Sestrin2. Lastly, a type of colon cancer that is associated with inflammation grew faster in mice that lacked the gene for Sestrin2. Taken together these findings represent evidence that Sestrin2 acts as a tumor suppressor in the colon. Future experiments might investigate how losing Sestrin2 makes these cells more resistant to chemotherapy and whether sestrins act as tumor suppressors in other tissues as well."

Sestrins were originally identified as a target of the tumor suppressor p53 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Budanov et al, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Velasco-Miguel et al, 1999</a>). Sestrins have two important functions, suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Budanov et al, 2004</a>) and inhibiting mTORC1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Budanov and Karin, 2008</a>). The ROS-suppressing effect of Sestrins is dependent, at least partially, on mTORC1 inhibition, which promotes autophagic degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria or an Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bae et al, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Woo et al, 2009</a>). However, Sestrin can also function as an active oxidoreductase that can directly detoxify ROS such as alkylhydroperoxides (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al, 2015a</a>). Sestrins inhibit mTORC1 through the\u00a0activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the\u00a0subsequent inactivation of Rheb GTPases (<a href=\"#bib6\">Budanov and Karin, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sanli et al, 2012</a>).

Sestrin-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 is also critical for limiting protein synthesis upon unfolded protein accumulation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bruning et al, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Park et al, 2014</a>) or amino acid starvation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Peng et al, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wolfson et al, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Ye et al, 2015</a>), thereby suppressing ER stress or nutrient crisis."

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining of WT colon displayed a normal pattern of cell proliferation; PCNA staining is confined to the base of colon crypts in WT mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), where epithelial progenitor cells are undergoing homeostatic proliferation that maintains normal turnover of the epithelium.

This result suggests that, in order to compensate for the apoptotic loss of epithelial cells, colonocytes of both <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup>/Sesn3<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice were undergoing active proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining of macrophage marker F4/80 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), as well as quantitative RT-PCR examination of inflammation markers <i>Tnfa</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>), <i>Il6</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>), <i>Il1b</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>) and <i>Il10</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1M</a>), show that <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice had increased the\u00a0levels of colon inflammation after DSS injury.

We examined whether the expression of Sestrin2 in the bone marrow-derived hematopoietic compartment is important for the protective role of Sestrin2 in colitis. For this purpose, reciprocal bone marrow chimera experiments were performed: WT bone marrow was introduced into lethally irradiated <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice (WT\u2192Sn2) while <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> bone marrow was introduced into lethally irradiated WT mice (Sn2\u2192WT). Both groups of chimeric mice were subjected to DSS administration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Interestingly, Sn2\u2192WT mice were similar to WT mice and able to recover from DSS-induced injury (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). However, more than 70% of WT\u2192Sn2 mice were dead at 6 days following DSS treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). WT\u2192Sn2 mice, but not Sn2\u2192WT mice, also experienced dramatic weight loss during the recovery phase following DSS treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Histological examination of the surviving mice revealed that, although the epithelial structure of Sn2\u2192WT mouse colon was nearly completely restored at 6 days after the DSS treatment, WT\u2192Sn2 colon epithelium was degenerated and marked by complete loss of epithelial cells and a robust increase in infiltrating immune cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Genotyping of spleen tissues in surviving WT\u2192Sn2 and Sn2\u2192WT mice confirmed that the hematopoietic compartment of recipient mice had been completely substituted with bone marrow cells of the donor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

DSS treatment was recently found to induce ER stress in colon epithelia (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cao et al, 2013</a>), and consistent with this report, we observed that DSS treatment can induce prolonged ER stress signaling that is associated with modestly elevated Sestrin2 expression (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, it is possible that Sestrin2 protects colon epithelium by allowing colonocytes to cope with DSS-induced ER stress insults, and thereby promoting colonic recovery after DSS injury. To test this idea, we analyzed the level of ER stress in WT and <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> colon epithelium recovering from DSS injury. Immunoblot analyses of colon tissue showed that <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup>/Sesn3<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice have elevated phosphorylation of pancreatic ER kinase (PERK) and increased expression of BiP and CHOP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>), when compared to WT mice. mRNA expression analysis for ER stress target genes, including spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) and BiP cofactor ERdj4, were also robustly upregulated in the colon of <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>).

Since pre-existing colitis (<a href=\"#bib49\">Terzic et al, 2010</a>) or tumor-elicited inflammation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Grivennikov et al, 2012</a>) is important for the progression of colon cancer, it is possible that Sestrin2 expression is lost or downregulated during colon carcinogenesis. Thus, we examined the Oncomine database, which contains diverse large-scale genomic and transcriptomic analyses of normal and tumor tissues (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rhodes et al, 2007</a>), to determine if there is a differential expression of Sestrins between normal and tumor tissues. Surprisingly, in virtually all of the colon cancer transcriptome studies available within the database, which were conducted in diverse platforms using different patient tissues, human Sestrin2 (<i>SESN2</i>) mRNA expression was strongly downregulated in colon adenocarcinoma tissues when compared to normal colon controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013G</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gaspar et al, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Graudens et al, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hong et al, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kaiser et al, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Skrzypczak et al, 2010</a>). The magnitude of <i>SESN2</i> suppression in tumors is often among the top 1\u20135% of all suppressed genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Considering that these data are collected from a variety of different human samples, the extent of the difference was very strong (all studies indicate p&lt;10<sup>\u20134</sup> or much lower). In contrast, other major cell type markers, such as <i>Villin (VIL1</i>, enterocytes), <i>DLL1</i> (progenitor cells), <i>F4/80 (EMR1</i>, macrophages), <i>Gr-1 (LY6G5B</i>, leukocytes), or <i>\u03b2-catenin (CTNNB</i>, colon epithelia), did not show such strong suppression (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013E</a>), while the stem cell marker <i>LGR5</i> was rather upregulated in tumor samples (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013E</a>). These results indicate that the downregulation of <i>SESN2</i> mRNA in colon cancer is specific and not an indirect consequence of different compositions of cell subtypes between normal and tumor tissues."

To test whether p53 mutation plays any role in regulating <i>SESN2</i> expression during colon carcinogenesis, we analyzed the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) dataset (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</a>) by partitioning tumors based on p53 status.

One group, designated as 'p53-mutated', has one or more missense or nonsense coding sequence mutations in the <i>TP53</i> gene. The second group, designated as 'p53-unknown', is classified as such because it does not reveal any coding sequence mutations in the <i>TP53</i> gene; however, it is still possible that these tumors contain <i>TP53</i> mutations in essential non-coding regions (e.g. promoters, enhancers or introns) or other genomic or epigenetic alterations that can lead to functional p53 inactivation (e.g. MDM2 overexpression).

The\u00a0analysis of two-year-old WT and <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice (n=6\u00a0each) did not reveal any noticeable colon tumors, suggesting that <i>Sesn2</i> may not be a classical tumor suppressor gene whose homozygous deletion is sufficient to induce spontaneous cancer development. However, given the strong correlation between <i>SESN2</i> expression and colon cancer tumorigenesis in humans (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), we reasoned that endogenous Sestrin2 may play a role in attenuating tumor development and progression. Thus, <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice were subjected to an established protocol of colitis-associated colon cancer induction; in this model, colon carcinogenesis is initiated by azoxymethane (AOM) administration and promoted by repeated colon injury induced by 2.5% DSS. However, none of <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice (n=7) survived the first round of colitis induction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), while WT mice were able to survive the entirety of the treatment. This is consistent with our findings that Sestrin2 has an important physiological role in maintaining epithelial integrity during colon injury (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>)."

                                "text": "It is possible that epithelial Sestrin2 expression tissue-autonomously suppresses colon tumor growth. Indeed, Sestrin2 is a potent inhibitor of mTORC1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Budanov and Karin, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al, 2013</a>), which is known to be critical for tumorigenic growth in colon cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Faller et al, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hardiman et al, 2014</a>). Therefore, we analyzed mTORC1 downstream target proteins in colon cancer and normal colon tissues from WT and <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice through immunohistochemistry. Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, which is mediated by an mTORC1 target p70 S6 kinase (S6K), is dramatically increased in tumors isolated from <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Consistent with this observation, phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP), an additional mTORC1 target, was also prominently increased in <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> colon cancer tissues, when compared to adjacent normal colon tissues as well as to WT colon cancer tissues (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). These immunohistochemical observations were also confirmed by immunoblotting experiments; S6 and 4E-BP phosphorylation was prominently increased in colon tumors of <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, compared to those of WT mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013I</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Tumors from WT\u2192Sn2 mice, but not those from Sn2\u2192WT mice, also exhibited hyperactive mTORC1 signaling, indicated by increased S6 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J\u2013L</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>,<a href=\"#fig6s3\">3B</a>). However, AKT Ser473 phosphorylation, which is mediated by mTORC2, a complex distinct from mTORC1, was not significantly altered by Sestrin2 loss in colon cancer tissues (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Collectively, these data suggest that Sestrin2 loss selectively leads to mTORC1 hyperactivation in colon cancer tissues, which subsequently allowed for prominent tumor overgrowth."

The expression of Sestrin2 in mouse colon tumor cells may provide an explanation for the relatively low mTORC1 activity in the tumors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013L</a>) that do not progress to adenocarcinomas (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rosenberg et al, 2009</a>). Interestingly, it has been formerly reported that most mouse colon tumors induced by the AOM-DSS treatment do not contain p53 mutations or misregulation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nambiar et al, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Takahashi and Wakabayashi, 2004</a>), and this may provide an explanation of why Sestrin2 expression is sustained in this specific mouse model of colon cancer. Indeed, SW480 cells, a human colon cancer cell line that displays very low p53 activity, demonstrated a strong downregulation of Sestrin2 expression, while RKO and HCT116 cells, which have wild-type p53 activity, expressed a relatively high amount of Sestrin2 proteins (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The p53-deficient HCT116 cells exhibited dramatic downregulation of Sestrin2 expression when compared to the parental HCT116 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Expression of Sestrin2 in hyperplastic mouse colon tissues, which have mutations in both <i>Apc</i> and <i>Kras</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Feng et al, 2013</a>), was also reduced by the loss of p53 or a dominant-negative mutation of p53 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Consistent with clinical data on human <i>SESN2</i> expression described above (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), these results further support the notion that p53 is critical for Sestrin2 expression in colon cancer cells."

To further investigate if this Sestrin2 activity is dependent on mTORC1 hyperactivation, we treated control and Sestrin2-silenced cells with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1.

Although control cell growth was strongly suppressed by 5-FU or CPT-11, Sestrin2 silencing rendered cells less susceptible to the chemotherapeutic drug treatments (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>), suggesting that Sestrin2 loss may confer chemotherapy resistance to colon cancer cells."

Yet, it is still possible that the mechanisms underlying increased susceptibility to colitis and colon cancer are separate from each other. During colitis stress, Sestrin2 functions to suppress ER stress and to promote regeneration of colon epithelium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). However, Sestrin2 expression is lost during human colon carcinogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) through inactivation of tumor suppressor p53 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>,<a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>). Because expression of Sestrin2 is important for suppressing hyperactive mTORC1 signaling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and tumor outgrowth (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), loss of Sestrin2 expression in human colon cancer serves as a critical tumorigenic mechanism. Indeed, Sestrin2 negatively controlled cell growth in various human colon cancer cell lines, which was dependent on mTORC1 regulation (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, inactivation of Sestrin2 conferred chemoresistance to colon cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), rendering them difficult to treat with conventional chemotherapeutic methods."

Thus, it is possible that the loss of Sestrin2 can contribute to cellular accumulation of ROS, which can promote DNA damage and genomic mutations that facilitate tumor development (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sablina et al, 2005</a>). However, analysis of \u03b3-H2AX did not show a significant increase in DNA damage between colon tumors of WT and <i>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J,M</a>). This result suggests that the mTORC1-regulatory function, rather than the ROS-inhibiting function, is the main contributor of Sestrin2\u2019s tumor suppressive activity in colon tissues. Nevertheless, it is still possible that Sestrin2 attenuates tumor growth, at least partially by inhibiting tumor-associated epithelial damage and inflammation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>), which are well-characterized promoters of colon cancer growth (<a href=\"#bib21\">Grivennikov et al, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Terzic et al, 2010</a>). It is also possible that Sestrin2 exerts tumor suppressive activity additionally through its apoptosis-inducing function, which was recently discovered (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ding et al, 2015</a>)."

However, only Sestrin2 was shown to be downregulated in human colon cancer tissues, and expression of Sestrin1 and Sestrin3 was unchanged or slightly upregulated in the colon cancer tissues. Nevertheless, Sestrin1 and Sestrin3 are strongly downregulated in several types of cancer tissues, such as lung cancers and lymphomas (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), suggesting that they may be involved in anti-tumorigenic processes in tissues other than the colon. <i>Drosophila</i> Sestrin, which is the only Sestrin homologue expressed in <i>Drosophila</i>, was formerly shown to be a feedback inhibitor of mTORC1, which can suppress hyperplastic tissue growth provoked by oncogenic mTORC1 hyperactivation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al, 2010</a>). As the current study demonstrates Sestrin2 to be an inhibitor of colon cancer growth, future studies on the role of Sestrin1 and Sestrin3 in carcinogenic processes of other tissues may reveal a conserved tumor-suppressive role of Sestrin-family proteins."

Did the authors carry out an analysis of Sesn2 locus to find if Sesn2 locus has undergone LOH in tumors? Also related to this figure, unlike TP53, which is mutated in about half of all colorectal cancers, SESN2 is rarely mutated. The authors mined several public datasets demonstrating that SESN2 expression is lower in tumors relative to normal tissues. Is this lower expression in human tumors due to mutation or loss of p53? How is SESN2 expression between tumors expressing wild type versus mutant p53? Reanalysis of the various datasets in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> partitioning tumors based on p53 status would be a significant addition to the paper and overall model.

In the revised manuscript, we have included additional immunoblot images, in which the actin marker was more lightly exposed (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In addition, analyses of qRT-PCR data, which was quantitatively normalized by <i>\u03b2-actin</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), further confirmed that ER stress is indeed increased in <i>Sesn2</i>-KO mice when compared to WT mice. Quantification of colon length (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) unequivocally demonstrated that colons of <i>Sesn2</i>-KO mice do not recover from DSS treatment and remain severely damaged. However, it is beyond the scope of our research to determine whether ER stress directly regulates apoptotic cell death or indirectly induces tissue degeneration through disruption of colonic homeostasis."

Also related to this figure, unlike TP53, which is mutated in about half of all colorectal cancers, SESN2 is rarely mutated. The authors mined several public datasets demonstrating that SESN2 expression is lower in tumors relative to normal tissues. Is this lower expression in human tumors due to mutation or loss of p53?
