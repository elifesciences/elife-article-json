Multiple Rev subunits assemble on the Rev Response Element (RRE), a structured region present in these RNAs, and direct their export through the Crm1 pathway. Rev-RRE assembly occurs via several Rev oligomerization and RNA-binding steps, but how these steps are coordinated to form an export\u2013competent complex is unclear. Here, we report the first crystal structure of a Rev dimer-RRE complex, revealing a dramatic rearrangement of the Rev-dimer upon RRE binding through re-packing of its hydrophobic protein\u2013protein interface. Rev-RNA recognition relies on sequence-specific contacts at the well-characterized IIB site and local RNA architecture at the second site. The structure supports a model in which the RRE utilizes the inherent plasticity of Rev subunit interfaces to guide the formation of a functional complex."

Multiple Rev subunits assemble on the Rev Response Element (RRE), a structured region present in these RNAs, and direct their export through the Crm1 pathway. Rev-RRE assembly occurs via several Rev oligomerization and RNA-binding steps, but how these steps are coordinated to form an export\u2013competent complex is unclear. Here, we report the first crystal structure of a Rev dimer-RRE complex, revealing a dramatic rearrangement of the Rev-dimer upon RRE binding through re-packing of its hydrophobic protein\u2013protein interface. Rev-RNA recognition relies on sequence-specific contacts at the well-characterized IIB site and local RNA architecture at the second site. The structure supports a model in which the RRE utilizes the inherent plasticity of Rev subunit interfaces to guide the formation of a functional complex."

The junction site was designed based on those studies (<a href=\"#bib12\">Daugherty et al., 2008</a>) and also on the observation that Rev binding melts a A-U base-pair in stem IIA at the junction (<a href=\"#bib8\">Charpentier et al., 1997</a>), a finding recently confirmed by SHAPE-seq experiments (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bai et al., 2014</a>).

The weaker interface may be further compensated by hydrogen bonding between the well-conserved Gln51 residues symmetrically located between the two subunits and observed only in the bound form (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Thus, mutation of Gln51 to alanine results in accumulation of Rev monomer-RNA complexes and \u223c30-fold reduced affinity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In the context of the full-length hexameric Rev-RRE complex, the effect of the Gln51Ala mutation was modest but reproducible, showing a twofold reduction in affinity in gel shift assays using a vast excess of protein over RNA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and reduced accumulation of dimer species in assays with stoichiometric amounts of Rev and RRE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). The modest effect of the mutation in the full-length context suggests that the Gln51 interaction may be less crucial during later stages of Rev-RRE assembly and the energetic contributions to cooperative binding may shift to other interactions, possibly coupled to further rearrangements of the Rev subunit interfaces. Alternatively, there may be multiple pathways towards cooperative assembly such that if one pathway is blocked, another may be used."

Comparison of our Rev dimer-IIB40 structure to the NMR structure of a Rev ARM peptide-IIB complex (<a href=\"#bib4\">Battiste et al., 1996</a>) shows that both the Rev arginine-rich-helix and IIB RNA site are remarkably similar in both the structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), although with subtle changes to some Rev-IIB contacts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For example, in the NMR structure, Asn40 hydrogen bonds to a G47-A73 base pair in IIB RNA, but is in a different plane and contacts G47 and G71 from adjacent base pairs in the dimer-RNA complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Interestingly, the Asn40-IIB interaction observed in the crystal structure is similar to that seen in an NMR structure of a Rev-ARM peptide-aptamer complex (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ye et al., 1996</a>), suggesting that optimal Rev-RNA contacts can be selected from several favorable conformers. The subtle differences between the NMR and crystal structures likely reflect a lack of precision of the early NMR data, with no violations observed to the current structure. The similarity in Rev-IIB recognition between the NMR structure, which depicts the first step in Rev-RRE assembly, and the crystal structure, which captures the progression into cooperative assembly, reiterates the importance of preserving this highly sequence-specific interface to support a specific and productive assembly."

Neither base is directly contacted by Rev, suggesting that their primary role is to create the junction site architecture. Consistently, deleting the bulge results in exclusively monomeric binding (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and previous studies showed that simply introducing bulges with variable sequences juxtaposed to IIB is sufficient to mediate co-operative Rev binding (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zemmel et al., 1996</a>). Most contacts at the junction site are to the phosphate backbone with the exception of Arg 43 and Arg44 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Stem IIA likely forms an A-form helix that merges into the junction to determine the relative placement of the remaining RRE. The second Rev subunit is positioned in the crystal structure to use its higher order oligomerization surface to recruit a third Rev subunit with its ARM oriented towards stem IIA for sequential Rev assembly. Presumably, the overall \u2018A\u2019-shaped RRE topology (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fang et al., 2013</a>) and arrangement of binding sites dictates the positioning of newly recruited subunits (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The specific model for Rev-RRE assembly proposed by <a href=\"#bib17\">Fang et al.

A previous study identified Asn40 as the most critical residue for IIB recognition, followed by Arg44, Arg38 and Arg39 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tan et al., 1993</a>). In the dimer-RNA complex however, alanine substitution of Arg44, which contacts both RNA sites, was most deleterious (250-fold reduced affinity) followed by Asn40 (100-fold), Arg39 (30\u201350-fold), and Arg38 (10-fold) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These mutations, as well as mutation of Gln51 which hydrogen bonds across the dimer interface, were all defective in viral RNA export and translation in Rev-RRE-dependent Gag-Pol reporter assays (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). When engineered into HIV-1, all mutations, except Gln51, also showed attenuated viral replication in tissue culture (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As noted above, Gln51 is important at the level of dimer formation but may be less critical in the full Rev-RRE context. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of infected cells indicated that these Rev mutations caused retention of unspliced HIV-1 RNAs in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), correlating with reduced Gag protein production (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

The architecture of the RRE and positioning of individual Rev-binding sites configures the predominantly hydrophobic protein\u2013protein interfaces to form a cooperative complex. This is reminiscent of the DNA-induced hetero-dimerization of nuclear receptors, where DNA sequence and spacing between protein-binding half-sites configures the dimer interface and dictates the choice of dimerization partners (<a href=\"#bib37\">Meijsing et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rastinejad et al., 2013</a>)."

Given the hydrophobic nature of the interfaces, other conformers are possible, especially when placed in the context of host\u2013protein complexes. These conformers can be combined in multiple arrangements to generate oligomers with diverse architectures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Since Rev likely interacts with other host proteins to transport and package viral RNAs during the virus life cycle (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jager et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Naji et al., 2012</a>), different quaternary structures of Rev may generate conformational states adapted to different host complexes at various stages of viral replication. This is highly reminiscent of the Ebola virus protein VP40, whose dimeric, hexameric, and octameric forms each have different roles in the viral life cycle (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bornholdt et al., 2013</a>), again highlighting the value of adaptable homo-oligomers in small RNA viruses. Recent crystal structures of HIV Tat (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tahirov et al., 2010</a>) and Vif (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guo et al., 2014</a>) with host protein complexes illustrate the importance of scaffolding structures to enable viral proteins to adopt ordered, functional states.

The \u2018jellyfish\u2019 model depicts Rev hexamers to be associated with the RNA on one side of the protein and NESs that recruit Crm1 export receptors on the other side (<a href=\"#bib13\">Daugherty et al., 2010b</a>). Recent structural studies show that the Rev-RRE complex binds a Crm1 dimer utilizing two NES-binding pockets positioned for Rev recognition (<a href=\"#bib5a\">Booth et al., 2014</a>). This study also shows that the RRE plays an important role in assembly of the export complex by enhancing the affinity of the Rev oligomer for Crm1, probably by using the RNA scaffold to organize the Rev subunits and increase the local concentration of NES peptides for Crm1 binding. Additionally, SAXS studies of the RRE (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fang et al., 2013</a>) and SHAPE-seq analysis of Rev-RRE assembly (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bai et al., 2014</a>) reveal that the RNA is compact and pre-ordered to bind Rev. Consequently, it may be inferred that changes to the RRE scaffold can affect the overall arrangement of Rev subunits and redistribute the spatial availability of NESs for Crm1 recruitment and nuclear export (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Multiple studies support this hypothesis: (1) Resistance to a dominant negative mutant of Rev with a defective NES arose through two mutations in the RRE that changed the RNA structure but not Rev multimerization (<a href=\"#bib29\">Legiewicz et al., 2008</a>), consistent with an RNA-guided reorganization of Rev oligomers. (2) Conversely, Rev complexes formed with simple repeats of the IIB hairpin displayed high RNA-binding affinity but did not recapitulate full export activity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Symensma et al., 1999</a>), indicating that the specific RRE architecture properly arranges the Rev oligomer for function. (3) A study of cognate Rev-RRE pairs from HIV-infected patients found that mutations in the RRE were responsible for changes in activity as the pairs evolved during the course of infection (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sloan et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that small changes in RRE sequence can alter the architecture of the Rev-RRE complex to tune its functional output. Previous studies likened the RRE to a molecular rheostat, where it is sensitive to the intracellular Rev concentrations and export activity adjusts accordingly (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mann et al., 1994</a>). It appears now that RRE can also perform as a structural/evolutionary rheostat, where changes to RRE structure during the course of infection can rearrange the Rev oligomer and tune the levels of nuclear export. It will be interesting to determine if interactions with other host proteins exploit the Rev-RRE oligomer in other ways."

Diffraction data was processed and scaled using XDS (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kabsch, 2010</a>). Attempts with molecular replacement using the unbound Rev dimer structure or models of Rev-IIB RNA complexes as starting models with native diffraction datasets (collected at 1.116 \u00c5) were unsuccessful. Using single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) data to 5.5 \u00c5 on a W-soaked crystal (collected at 1.2146 \u00c5), tungstate ions were located using ShelxD, phased and density-modified using ShelxE (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sheldrick, 2010</a>). The crystal belonged to P4<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 space group with three copies of the Rev dimer-RNA complex and one W site per asymmetric unit. Density for the Rev helices and RNA was very clear and Rev molecules from the Rev-dimer structure (<a href=\"#bib13\">Daugherty et al., 2010b</a>) and an RNA fragment from IIB RNA NMR structure (<a href=\"#bib4\">Battiste et al., 1996</a>) were fit into the protein and RNA densities, respectively, using rigid-body fit in Coot (<a href=\"#bib16\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>). The resulting model was used for molecular replacement into the 3.2 \u00c5 native data in the cubic space group (P4<sub>1</sub>32) in Phaser (<a href=\"#bib36\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>). Initial solutions scored poorly but the appearance of positive density near the RNA fragment at the second Rev-binding site suggested that the solution was correct. Following iterative rounds of model building of the RNA using RCrane (<a href=\"#bib26\">Keating and Pyle, 2010</a>) in Coot and refinement in Phenix (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>), a second round of molecular replacement was carried out using the newly built RNA alone as the search model. This time, the solution was clear with positive density for both Rev subunits. Rev subunits were then built into the density with iterative model building and refinement. The final model had good stereochemistry and showed no Ramchandran outliers (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2010</a>). While density for most water molecules or ions was not apparent at this resolution, we could place one water molecule bridging a Rev-RNA contact. Solvent-accessible surface areas were calculated using PISA (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</a>) and figures were generated using PyMOL (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schrodinger, 2010</a>)."

The optimal ratio of reporter to Rev expression plasmids was first determined to establish maximal signal under non-saturating conditions for the assay. Subsequently, 50,000 HEK 293T cells, each in 96-well microtiter plate wells, were transfected with 90 ng of reporter plasmid, 0.3 ng of Rev expression plasmid, 5 ng of an mCherry fluorochrome expression vector (to visualize transfection efficiency) and 4.7 ng of pBS carrier DNA. 48 hr after transfection, the culture supernatant was removed, the cells were lysed and intracellular p24 was quantified by ELISA. mCherry expression was consistent across all transfections at the time of cell lysis.

In order to crystallize the complex, the authors used a Rev construct in which two residues were mutated at one of the hydrophobic oligomerization interfaces, promoting formation with only a Rev dimer. While dimerization of Rev occurs using the same hydrophobic interfaces as previously reported, the structure reveals that the Rev dimer binds the RNA with a crossing angle that is much more acute than was previously shown in the dimer in the absence of RNA (50 deg vs. 120-140 deg.). The authors suggest that this degree of freedom (different crossing angles) may be exploited in the formation of higher order complexes. Strong biochemical and molecular virological analyses are presented in support of the structure."

Important new contributions include: 1) the discovery that the crossing angle and hydrophobic interface of the Rev dimer can change quite dramatically (\u223c70 degrees) in response to RNA binding, which allows the two ARM helices to bind in adjacent major grooves of the RNA, and 2) the definition of a new Rev-RNA binding mode (seen for the Rev-RNA Junction site), which may represent the second step in cooperative assembly of Rev with the RRE. The manuscript is clear and well written, and the descriptions of the structure are very lucid. The study is of high technical quality, reveals remarkable molecular flexibility in both the Rev protein configuration and its RNA interactions, and represents an important advance in our understanding of the molecular basis for HIV-1 RNA export. This and the accompanying manuscript describing the EM of a Crm1 dimer bound to Rev-RRE are the most significant advance in this important story for many years."

While the authors argue that, in the context of a larger RNA, this mutation's effects can be overcome is an interesting idea, there is no actual evidence. A simpler explanation is that the complex uses a different pathway for oligomerization, or even that multiple pathways exist, and if one pathway is blocked then another can be readily utilized. The authors should address this issue more directly or present data showing that the observed complex is truly a part of the oligomerization pathway."

It is equally plausible, for example, that crossing angles similarly acute to the one reported herein are ubiquitously used for RNP assembly, with larger angles used for interaction with other host-cell proteins (or other variations on the same theme).
