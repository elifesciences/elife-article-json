Using concurrent time-resolved biophysical and biological measurements, we define the toxic species produced during IAPP amyloid formation and link their properties to induction of rat INS-1 \u03b2-cell and murine islet toxicity. These globally flexible, low order oligomers upregulate pro-inflammatory markers and induce reactive oxygen species. They do not bind 1-anilnonaphthalene-8-sulphonic acid and lack extensive \u03b2-sheet structure. Aromatic interactions modulate, but are not required for toxicity. Not all IAPP oligomers are toxic; toxicity depends on their partially structured conformational states. Some anti-amyloid agents paradoxically prolong cytotoxicity by prolonging the lifetime of the toxic species. The data highlight the distinguishing properties of toxic IAPP oligomers and the common features that they share with toxic species reported for other amyloidogenic polypeptides, providing information for rational drug design to treat IAPP induced \u03b2-cell death."

Using concurrent time-resolved biophysical and biological measurements, we define the toxic species produced during IAPP amyloid formation and link their properties to induction of rat INS-1 \u03b2-cell and murine islet toxicity. These globally flexible, low order oligomers upregulate pro-inflammatory markers and induce reactive oxygen species. They do not bind 1-anilnonaphthalene-8-sulphonic acid and lack extensive \u03b2-sheet structure. Aromatic interactions modulate, but are not required for toxicity. Not all IAPP oligomers are toxic; toxicity depends on their partially structured conformational states. Some anti-amyloid agents paradoxically prolong cytotoxicity by prolonging the lifetime of the toxic species. The data highlight the distinguishing properties of toxic IAPP oligomers and the common features that they share with toxic species reported for other amyloidogenic polypeptides, providing information for rational drug design to treat IAPP induced \u03b2-cell death."

It has been widely proposed that toxic oligomers produced by disparate proteins share many similar features (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bolognesi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Chimon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Glabe, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Laganowsky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mannini et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Bucciantini et al., 2002</a>). However, it is not known if IAPP oligomers are similar to toxic oligomers formed by other proteins; nor is it clear how oligomers formed by different proteins vary or how structured they are (<a href=\"#bib24\">Chimon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Glabe, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lendel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sandberg et al., 2010</a>). Here we use a multi-disciplinary approach to simultaneously monitor the real-time kinetics of IAPP toxicity and amyloid formation in solution, and measure the biochemical and physio-chemical properties of toxic and non-toxic IAPP species transiently produced over the course of aggregation, thereby linking specific molecular properties of amyloidogenic IAPP species to induction of \u03b2-cell death. The results provide important information about the nature of toxic IAPP oligomers, their unique properties and the common features they share with toxic entities produced in other amyloidosis diseases."

The polypeptide plays an adaptive role in metabolism and glucose homeostasis, but in metabolic disease, h-IAPP forms pancreatic islet amyloid fibrils by an unknown mechanism (<a href=\"#bib3\">Abedini and Schmidt, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Cao et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Westermark et al., 2011</a>). The initiation site of islet amyloid formation is not known. Existing data indicate that both extracellular and intracellular h-IAPP oligomers contribute to islet \u03b2-cell toxicity. Histological studies show that amyloid deposits associated with T2D are extracellular (<a href=\"#bib90\">Westermark et al., 2011</a>). Rodent IAPP is not toxic and does not form amyloid (<a href=\"#bib90\">Westermark et al., 2011</a>), however, studies in transgenic rodent models that over-express h-IAPP and modulate the normal h-IAPP to insulin ratio suggest that islet amyloidosis may also have an intracellular origin. Intracellular aggregation of h-IAPP in these animal models suggests that defects in autophagy and/or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress play a role in toxicity; however, other reports argue that ER stress is not a significant contributor (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hull et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Huang et al., 2007</a>). There is strong evidence that extracellular oligomers induce cytotoxicity in vivo (<a href=\"#bib90\">Westermark et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib69\">Park et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Aston-Mourney et al., 2011</a>). Studies using a transgenic islet model that expresses human-relevant levels of h-IAPP demonstrate that h-IAPP secretion is required for amyloid formation and \u03b2-cell toxicity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Aston-Mourney et al., 2011</a>). Receptor-mediated mechanisms of h-IAPP toxicity support a role for extracellular oligomers, as do studies showing that h-IAPP oligomers activate the inflammasome (<a href=\"#bib45\">Johnson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Masters et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Park et al., 2012</a>), and recent findings that extracellular h-IAPP oligomers can be transported into \u03b2-cells (<a href=\"#bib83\">Trikha and Jeremic, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Sheedy et al., 2013</a>). Thus, toxic h-IAPP oligomers can induce \u03b2-cell toxicity by both extra- and intracellular mechanisms. Here we focus on extracellular islet amyloidosis by h-IAPP."

Little or no amyloid is formed in the lag phase and little is known about the nature of the species that populate this phase. Secondary nucleation leads to production of new fibrils, either by breakage of the small number of fibrils present or by templating new aggregates off the surface of existing fibrils. We developed time-resolved assays that allow concurrent biophysical, biochemical and biological characterization of the ensemble of species produced during IAPP amyloid formation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Physiologically relevant solution conditions were found such that assembly of IAPP occurs on long time scales. The time scale is sufficiently long enough that the presence of toxic species can be detected indirectly by removing aliquots and applying them to cultured rat INS-1 \u03b2-cells or murine pancreatic islets. Stock solutions of h-IAPP, h-IAPP mutants and non-toxic, non-amyloidogenic rat IAPP (r-IAPP) were prepared by dissolving the peptides in buffer (time-zero) and incubating them at 25\u00b0C (pH 7.4). Aliquots were removed at various time points over the course of aggregation and characterized by the amyloid sensitive dye thioflavin-T and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); aliquots were also applied to cultured \u03b2-cells at the same time points. Addition of aliquots to the cells involves only a 30% dilution of the peptide stock solutions. Control experiments using photochemical induced cross-linking and thioflavin-T kinetic assays of amyloid formation in buffer at 25\u00b0C reveal that this modest dilution does not significantly alter the distribution of oligomers, nor does it significantly alter the time course of amyloid formation. The same dilution into cell culture medium at 37\u00b0C has no significant effect on the time course (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>). Toxicity was assessed by measuring loss in cellular metabolic function, detected by Alamar Blue reduction assays; production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); upregulation of inflammatory markers; production of cleaved caspase-3; and by observed changes in cellular morphology by light microscopy. These real-time experiments probe kinetic species produced during the course of h-IAPP amyloid formation, and are fundamentally different from the common approach in which peptide is added to cells upon dissolution in cell culture medium and toxicity monitored after subsequent incubation times on cells. This experimental design also differs from studies that attempt to trap non-amyloidogenic oligomers using surfaces such as gold particles, detergents or micelles. It is not known how surface-trapping techniques affect the conformational properties of oligomers (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bram et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kayed, 2003</a>). The experiments reported here provide critical information about toxic, amyloidogenic IAPP oligomers in solution."

Toxicity decreases in the growth phase and disappears in the saturation phase, directly indicating that the toxic species are transient lag phase intermediates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). Thioflavin-T binding assays and TEM studies confirm that the toxic intermediates are pre-fibrillar in nature. Aliquots of h-IAPP lag phase species appear to be amorphous and deposit on TEM grids as small spherical aggregates of various size, while species in the saturation phase exhibit long, unbranched amyloid fibril morphology (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We conducted additional biological experiments to determine whether h-IAPP lag phase intermediates produced in vitro are also toxic to pancreatic islets. We isolated and hand purified pancreatic islets from wild-type mice, confirmed the health and integrity of these organelles via immunofluorescence and light microscopy, and carried out ex vivo islet viability assays after incubation of the islets with either toxic h-IAPP lag phase intermediates or buffer control. The data provide direct evidence that the lag phase intermediates are toxic to cells in tissue. These results are consistent with our cellular studies and support our conclusion that h-IAPP lag phase intermediates are toxic to insulin producing pancreatic \u03b2-cells and primary islets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E and F</a>)."

Ultracentrifugation studies demonstrate that h-IAPP toxic species are soluble. Samples of toxic h-IAPP intermediates and amyloid fibrils were pelleted at 20,000\u2009<i>g</i> for 20\u2009min and the soluble peptide remaining in the supernatant was measured. Control experiments confirm that r-IAPP is soluble under these conditions. At least 88% of h-IAPP is pelleted in the sample of fibrils, even at these low <i>g</i>-forces, while 94% of the peptide in the sample of toxic lag phase intermediates remains in the supernatant. TEM and thioflavin-T binding assays confirm the absence of amyloid in the supernatant of ultracentrifuged samples of toxic intermediates, and the presence of amyloid in the pellet obtained from samples of h-IAPP fibrils (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). The supernatant of intermediates is toxic to \u03b2-cells, while the resuspended pellet from samples of amyloid fibrils is not, verifying that cytotoxic entities reside in the soluble phase and are not high molecular weight species (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Characterization of the ensemble of h-IAPP lag phase intermediates by circular dichroism (CD) reveals partial apparent helical structure. Positive signal is observed below 190 nm and a minima at 208 nm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). A second broad minima centered at 220 nm is also detected with a mean residue ellipticity on the order of \u22126000 (deg-cm2/dmol), consistent with transiently populated partial \u03b1-helical structure (<a href=\"#bib55\">Manning and Woody, 1991</a>). However, helical and \u03b2-sheet CD signatures overlap in this region of the spectrum. Thus, the broad signal in this region may also include contributions from the presence of some \u03b2-sheet structure. Two dimensional infrared (2D IR) studies, described below, indicate that the overall level of \u03b2-structure is modest. With further incubation, the CD spectrum of h-IAPP changes and eventually converts into a spectrum indicative of \u03b2-structure (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Aliquots of the supernatant from samples of toxic intermediates were characterized by CD, both before and after ultracentrifugation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). The spectra are superimposable, confirming that the observed CD signal reflects the peptide in the soluble fraction and demonstrates that the overall conformation of the ensemble of oligomeric intermediates in solution remains the same after ultracentrifugation."

                                "text": "We next sought to determine the approximate distribution of oligomeric species present in toxic h-IAPP solutions. Aliquots of toxic lag phase intermediates were trapped by in situ photochemical induced cross-linking and examined by SDS-PAGE, allowing differentiation between monomers and different size oligomers in solution. The in situ approach avoids concerns of structural perturbations induced by attaching photoactive groups and has been successfully used to study A\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bitan and Teplow, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bitan et al., 2001</a>). The data reveal a distribution of oligomers ranging from monomers to hexamers at time points of toxicity, confirming that the ensemble of toxic h-IAPP lag phase intermediates are soluble, low order oligomers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G and H</a>). Control studies show that the observed distribution is not an artifact of the irradiation time used for photochemical cross-linking (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The dead time of the measurement (the time before the first measurement) is on the order of 10\u2009min; a distribution of oligomers ranging from monomers to hexamers is populated within that time frame and the relative populations are similar to those detected later in the lag phase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G and\u00a0H</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The data are consistent with independent ion mobility mass spectroscopy studies that report that a distribution of h-IAPP monomers to hexamers form within 2\u2009min of initiating amyloid formation, and that the distribution is present later in the lag phase (<a href=\"#bib98\">Young et al., 2014</a>). The rapid formation of oligomers and their persistence through the lag phase is consistent with recently proposed models of h-IAPP amyloid formation that posit that the lag phase could be controlled by a significant structural rearrangement within an oligomeric nucleus that involves crossing a high free energy barrier (<a href=\"#bib18\">Buchanan et al., 2013</a>). Analysis of apparent relative populations of h-IAPP toxic species, deduced from the gel, indicate that dimers, trimers and tetramers are the most populated species. Monomeric proteins can be cross-linked by diffusion and collision of the photochemically modified monomers and it is important to show that the observed distribution differs from that expected for a monomeric protein (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bitan and Teplow, 2004</a>). Thus, we employed a variant of the villin headpiece helical subdomain (HP35*), which is a soluble non-amyloidogenic protein of similar size to IAPP, as a control. The wild-type subdomain contains a single Trp and a Met, but no Tyr. We replaced Trp with Tyr, and Met with nor-leucine to ensure that the control peptide contains the same photochemically active residues as h-IAPP. Quantitative analysis of the silver stained gels reveal that the distribution of cross-linked h-IAPP species is significantly different from that expected for a monomeric protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We also compared the observed oligomer distributions to those predicted by Teplow and coworkers for diffusing monomers of molecular weight 4 KDaltons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bitan et al., 2001</a>). That analysis considered the case of spherical monomers which do not interact except by diffusion with random elastic collisions. For low efficiency cross-linking, the model predicts that the most populated species is the monomer, and an approximately exponential decrease in intensity of high order species is predicted. Medium efficiency cross-linking still leads to the monomer being the dominate species, but to a shallower exponential decay in the relative populations. Both cases clearly differ from that observed for h-IAPP. High efficiency cross-linking is predicted to lead to further consumption of monomers and a shift in the maximum to dimers with the predicted monomer and dimer populations being noticeably higher than the predicted trimer, tetramer and pentamer populations. Again, this distribution is fundamentally different from that observed for h-IAPP lag phase species, where trimers are the most highly populated species and the population of pentamers is comparable to the population of monomers. The pattern of cross-linking observed for h-IAPP lag phase species is also very different than observed if pre-formed amyloid fibrils are cross-linked. h-IAPP was allowed to form fibrils and then the samples were centrifuged. No cross-linked h-IAPP oligomers were detected in the supernatant. Re-solubilization of the cross-linked fibrils revealed that the dominant species were monomers with some dimer present (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). The various control experiments together with comparison to independent mass spectrometry studies confirm that the observation of lag phase h-IAPP oligomers is robust."

We wondered if non-amyloidogenic, non-toxic variants of IAPP oligomerize, and if so, whether the size distribution and/or the structure of the oligomers produced were significantly different. r-IAPP is non-toxic and non-amyloidogenic in vivo and is widely used as a negative control in biological and biophysical/biochemical studies of h-IAPP (<a href=\"#bib90\">Westermark et al., 2011</a>). However, it aggregates and forms oligomers. To further validate the use of r-IAPP as a negative control, we carried out dose-response experiments to test the effect of incubating INS-1 \u03b2-cells with up to 6-fold higher concentrations (84 \u00b5M) of r-IAPP for up to 19-fold longer incubation times on cells (96\u2009h) than used in the assays employed herein to assess h-IAPP toxicity. No detectable toxicity was observed for r-IAPP, even at these significantly higher concentrations (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The r-IAPP sequence differs from the h-IAPP sequence at six positions and contains three Pro residues and a His-18 to Arg replacement (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Pro is a well-known breaker of secondary structure and substitution of His with Arg will increase the net charge of the peptide. Cross-linking studies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) reveal a broadly similar distribution of oligomers produced in solution by r-IAPP and h-IAPP, with detected species ranging from monomers to hexamers. There are some differences in the relative intensities of the different oligomeric states, but these are relatively modest and it is difficult to unambiguously deduce their significance. The important feature is that the rat polypeptide clearly oligomerizes and forms dimers to hexamers similar to that of the human peptide; yet, it is not toxic (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Characterization by thioflavin-T binding assays and TEM confirm that r-IAPP does not form amyloid fibrils during these experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D and E</a>). Independent ion mobility mass spectroscopy (IM-MS) studies have also shown that h-IAPP and r-IAPP form similar distributions of oligomers (<a href=\"#bib98\">Young et al., 2014</a>). Cell viability assays carried out simultaneously with biophysical measurements using aliquots from the same stock solutions show that r-IAPP is not toxic at any time point under these conditions, even though it oligomerizes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F and G</a>). Additional studies show that r-IAPP is not toxic over a 28 day time course (data not shown). CD studies reveal that r-IAPP oligomers appear less structured than their h-IAPP counterparts, as indicated by a positive signal below 190 nm and less intense signal between 218 to 222 nm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>) in the spectrum of lag phase oligomers. While the differences in the CD spectra of r-IAPP and h-IAPP are moderate, they are significant and reproducible using different preparations of both peptides and in independent experiments conducted by different investigators. In contrast to h-IAPP, the CD spectrum of non-amyloidogenic r-IAPP does not change with time and is independent of concentration over the range tested (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). To further test if toxicity is decoupled from general aggregation, we examined an I26P point mutant of h-IAPP (I26P-IAPP) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We have previously shown that I26P-IAPP inhibits amyloid formation by h-IAPP and does not form amyloid by itself under the conditions of our studies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abedini et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Meng et al., 2010</a>). I26P-IAPP is similar to h-IAPP in hydrophobicity and has an identical net charge. Like r-IAPP, this mutant forms low order oligomers with an apparent size distribution that is similar to h-IAPP oligomers, as judged by photochemical induced cross-linking studies, but is non-amyloidogenic under these conditions over the 35+ h duration of these studies, as judged by thioflavin-T binding assays and TEM (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D and I</a>). The CD spectrum of I26P-IAPP is similar to that of r-IAPP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Cell viability assays carried out in parallel with biophysical studies show that I26P-IAPP is not toxic at any time point in our studies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F and J</a>). As an additional control, we analyzed a recently described non-toxic variant of h-IAPP (<a href=\"#bib86\">Wang et al., 2014a</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). The H18R, G24P, I26P triple mutant of h-IAPP (TM-IAPP) has been shown to be non-amyloidogenic and non-toxic (<a href=\"#bib87\">Wang et al., 2014b</a>). Photochemical induced cross-linking and CD studies show that this variant also oligomerizes, even though it remains as random coil as judged by CD (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5B\u2013D</a>). Thus, all three of the different non-toxic variants, which have similar hydrophobicity to h-IAPP, oligomerize (<a href=\"#fig5s6\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s7\">7</a>). It is not possible to resolve the structural differences between the transiently populated ensemble of h-IAPP oligomers and the ensembles populated by r-IAPP, I26P-IAPP and TM-IAPP. However, the key point is that properties of the polypeptides beyond their ability to oligomerize are clearly important determinants of cellular toxicity. It is interesting to note that there are differences in the distribution of h-IAPP oligomers and the non-toxic r-IAPP and I26P-IAPP\u00a0variants. Relatively more dimer is detected for h-IAPP compared to these two non-toxic\u00a0variants and a reduction in the relative population of pentamers and hexamers is also detected. This may reflect actual differences in the distribution of oligomers in solution or it may include contributions from changes in cross-linking efficiency. The data cannot differentiate between the two potential explanations. The key feature is that these results decouple general aggregation and oligomer formation from toxic species formation, and suggest that the conformational properties of oligomers, and not their size, are important determinants of cellular toxicity."

Of particular interest is a comparison with the A\u03b2 peptide of AD, given the similarity between the two polypeptides and recent studies that suggest a link between AD and T2D (<a href=\"#bib96\">Yang and Song, 2013</a>). h-IAPP and A\u03b240 have 25% amino acid identity and 50% similarity with segments believed to be important for the self-assembly of each peptide, h-IAPP (<a href=\"#bib69\">Park et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Zraika et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Cooper et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bolognesi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Chimon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Glabe, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Laganowsky et al., 2012</a>) and A\u03b240 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Chimon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Glabe, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Laganowsky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mannini et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Bucciantini et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lendel et al., 2014</a>) having high similarity (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A\u03b2 fibrils can seed amyloid formation by h-IAPP in vitro and in an animal model, and the two polypeptides interact in vitro (<a href=\"#bib5\">Andreetto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">O'Nuallain et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Oskarsson et al., 2015</a>). Recent work has revealed significant levels of \u03b2-sheet structure in toxic oligomers from several proteins, including A\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Chimon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Laganowsky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lendel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sandberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Do et al., 2016</a>). We detected apparent partial helical structure in the ensemble of toxic h-IAPP lag phase oligomers by CD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5H</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Observation of partial helical structure is consistent with studies of truncated h-IAPP analogs fused to maltose binding protein; as well as studies of h-IAPP aromatic residue mutants, and NMR studies of soluble IAPP variants (<a href=\"#bib94\">Wiltzius et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Williamson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Tu and Raleigh, 2013</a>). It is also known that helical structure can be stabilized in h-IAPP by binding to negatively charged surfaces such as sulfated glycosaminoglycans or to vesicles containing significant amounts of anionic lipids (<a href=\"#bib94\">Wiltzius et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Williamson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Tu and Raleigh, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Brender et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Knight et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Meng et al., 2007</a>). CD is well suited to probe helical structure, but is less sensitive to the details of \u03b2-sheet structure; individual \u03b2-sheets can exhibit significant differences in their CD signal. Thus, we applied newly developed 2D IR methods. 2D IR is a sensitive probe of \u03b2-sheet structure in aggregating systems (<a href=\"#bib18\">Buchanan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Strasfeld et al., 2009</a>). The spectrum of h-IAPP amyloid fibrils has significant intensity along the diagonal in the \u03b2-sheet region between 1615 and 1625 cm<sup>-1</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and is in good agreement with published spectra of h-IAPP amyloid fibrils. A flexible, partially structured intermediate will yield a significantly less intense 2D IR spectrum than a well-ordered \u03b2-structure, since the parallel \u03b2-sheet structure in amyloid fibrils leads to a large transition dipole. The spectrum of the intermediates is much less intense than the spectrum of the amyloid fibrils, indicating only modest levels of \u03b2-sheet structure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Based on the relative areas in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, the upper limit for the \u03b2-sheet content in the ensemble of lag phase intermediates populated under these conditions is estimated to be on the order of 15%. This does not preclude a high level of \u03b2-structure in a short segment of the protein. Recent isotope edited 2D IR studies using 10- to 20-fold higher h-IAPP concentrations than used herein (the isotope edited studies cannot currently be conducted at 40 \u00b5M peptide for technical reasons) suggest that h-IAPP forms an intermediate with well developed, parallel, in\u2013register \u03b2-structure in the FGAIL region during amyloid formation under those conditions (<a href=\"#bib18\">Buchanan et al., 2013</a>). A \u03b2-sheet of this size is fully consistent with the 2D IR data presented here."

We tested if toxic h-IAPP lag phase intermediates bind ANS. No ANS binding is observed in the lag phase, but is observed during the growth phase of amyloid formation and in the saturation phase containing fibrils (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B and C</a>). Thus, the properties of h-IAPP toxic oligomers are distinct from those recently described for certain other amyloidogenic proteins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bolognesi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Laganowsky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mannini et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lendel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sandberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Frare et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lorenzen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Stroud et al., 2012</a>). 4,4\u2032-Dianilino-1,1\u2032-binaphthyl-5,5\u2032-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS) has also been used to probe molten globule states, the formation of exposed hydrophobic patches, and, in limited applications, amyloid formation (<a href=\"#bib97\">Younan and Viles, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hawe et al., 2008</a>). Binding of bis-ANS to partially folded states often leads to a larger fluorescence change than ANS binding. We also tested the ability of h-IAPP toxic intermediates to bind bis-ANS. No binding to lag phase species is observed, but the dye, like ANS, binds to h-IAPP amyloid fibrils (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Nile Red, like ANS, is used as a fluorescent probe of hydrophobic protein surfaces and has been shown to bind to pre-amyloid oligomers formed by some amyloidogenic proteins, but recent studies, conducted under different conditions than employed in our work, show that it does not bind to h-IAPP lag phase intermediates (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hawe et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Jha et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Krishnan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Sackett and Wolff, 1987</a>).

Its fluorescence is high when the cyano-group is solvent exposed and hydrogen bonded, and low when it is not; the fluorescence is also quenched via FRET to Tyr with a Ro of 15\u00c5. h-IAPP contains two Phe and one Tyr; thus, three analogs were prepared in which one aromatic residue was replaced by <i>p</i>-cyanoPhe at each position (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A-D</a>). Fluorescence is high for unaggregated h-IAPP (time-zero) and is quenched in the amyloid fibrils. The fluorescence intensity of the lag phase intermediates is also high and shows only moderate differences from the value observed for each peptide at time-zero, but is much higher than the intensity observed from the amyloid fibrils (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). The data indicate that Phe-15, Phe-23 and Tyr-37 are largely solvent exposed in the lag phase, and rule out a significant population of conformations in the ensemble in which the aromatic residues are buried, or in which the C-terminal Tyr forms persistent interactions with either Phe-15 or Phe-23. Again, these results are compatible with 2D IR studies undertaken at higher peptide concentrations, which postulate formation of \u03b2-sheet structure in the FGAIL region."

The data does not preclude short regions of well-ordered polypeptide and intermolecular hydrogen bonding provided such interactions do not lead to significant sequestering of the aromatic residues from solvent, development of ANS binding surfaces or significant protection of Proteinase K cleavage sites. This combination of properties indicates that toxic h-IAPP lag phase oligomers share similar features with those reported for a range of other amyloidogenic proteins, but are not identical to them (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bolognesi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Laganowsky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mannini et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lendel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sandberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Frare et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lorenzen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Stroud et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Chen et al., 2015</a>).

Although they are not required for h-IAPP amyloid formation, mutation of the three aromatic residues in h-IAPP to Leu (3xL-IAPP) slows the rate of amyloid formation (<a href=\"#bib84\">Tu and Raleigh, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Marek et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gazit, 2007</a>). Our <i>p</i>-cyanoPhe experiments show that there are no persistent interactions between F15 and Y37 or F23 and Y37 of h-IAPP, but the studies are less sensitive to formation of low levels (&lt;5 to 10%) of conformers with F15/Y37 or F23/Y37 contacts, and do not probe potential interactions between F15 and F23. Consequently, we examined a triple mutant of h-IAPP: F15L, F23L, Y37L-IAPP (3xL-IAPP) that lacks aromatic residues to test whether or not aromatic <i>\u03c0-\u03c0</i> interactions or aromatic-hydrophobic interactions are required for toxicity (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Thioflavin-T assays and TEM measurements confirm that the triple mutant does form amyloid more slowly than the human peptide (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013D</a>). Cell viability studies show, that like h-IAPP, 3XL-IAPP exhibits time dependent toxicity; the amyloid fibrils produced by 3xL-IAPP are not toxic to \u03b2-cells, but species populated in the lag phase are, further confirming that toxicity resides with pre-amyloid intermediates (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013E</a>). Dose-response studies show that 3xL-IAPP evokes significantly lower levels of toxicity than h-IAPP. At their respective time points of maximum toxicity, 40\u2009\u03bcM 3xL-IAPP reduced \u03b2-cell viability to 67%, while 20 \u03bcM h-IAPP reduced \u03b2-cell viability to 35% (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). However, 3xL-IAPP is clearly still toxic, indicating that aromatic residues, and hence <i>\u03c0-\u03c0</i> interactions, are not an absolute requirement for h-IAPP toxicity, but do contribute to it."

This is particularly important since many in vitro screens of amyloid inhibitors rely on kinetic assays of amyloid formation. We tested this hypothesis using the I26P-IAPP inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abedini et al., 2007</a>). Time-resolved kinetic studies of cytotoxicity and amyloid formation show that a 1:1 addition of I26P-IAPP lengthens both the lag phase and the growth phase, and increases the duration of toxicity proportionally (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). The value of T50 (the time required to reach 50% of the total signal change in a thioflavin-T experiment) is increased by a factor of two, as is the length of the lag phase, defined here as the time required to reach 10% of the total change in thioflavin-T signal. We conclude that an effective inhibitor of amyloid formation can be deleterious to cells if it does not prevent the formation or the accumulation of toxic lag phase intermediates, but traps them instead in their toxic conformation."

Toxic h-IAPP species are found to be partially structured, globally flexible, soluble, low order oligomers with solvated aromatic side chains that populate the lag phase of amyloid formation. The data do not preclude the ordering of short segments of the chain, nor do they rule out regions with intermolecular hydrogen bonds or short segments of intermolecular \u03b2-sheets. The ensemble of toxic h-IAPP intermediates are susceptible to proteolysis and do not require \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions or aromatic-hydrophobic contacts to form, however removal of the aromatic residues does reduce toxicity. These toxic species of h-IAPP induce oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cellular processes leading to \u03b2-cell apoptosis. Studies with I26P-IAPP, TM-IAPP and r-IAPP demonstrate that not all IAPP oligomers are toxic, decoupling general oligomerization from toxicity; and suggest that the conformational properties of oligomers and/or their stability, rather than their size, are important determinants of toxicity. Along these lines, IM-MS studies indicated that low order r-IAPP and h-IAPP oligomers have different gas phase conformations and exhibit different gas phase stabilities, and suggest that certain inhibitors of toxicity target subspecies of oligomers (<a href=\"#bib98\">Young et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Dupuis et al., 2009</a>). Toxicity has been linked to the surface hydrophobicity of oligomers formed by other amyloidogenic proteins\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib56\">Mannini et al., 2014</a>),\u00a0but that does not appear to rationalize the relative toxicity of the oligomers examined here. The mutations do reduce the hydrophobicity of the chain, but the effects are modest, particularly for the I26P-IAPP point mutant, and h-IAPP oligomers do not bind the dyes ANS, bis-ANS or Nile Red (<a href=\"#fig5s6\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s7\">7</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is not currently possible to pinpoint the structural features that distinguish toxic oligomers from those that are non-toxic, but all of the non-toxic variants examined here contain proline substitutions within a region of h-IAPP that has been postulated to form transient, parallel, in register \u03b2-sheet structure during amyloid formation in solution. The ability of proline to disrupt secondary structure in this region may well be an important feature in reducing toxicity."

Like other toxic oligomers, particularly those that are formed by intrinsically disordered proteins, they are soluble, pre-fibrillar in character, contain partial secondary structure, and bind to molecules such as EGCG. However, they do not bind ANS, bis-ANS or Nile Red; and the overall \u03b2-sheet and \u03b1-helical content measured for the ensemble of toxic h-IAPP oligomers in solution is much less than that described for a range of other amyloidogenic proteins. Isoforms of the A\u03b2 peptide of AD and a fragment derived from \u03b1B crystallin have been shown to contain extensive regions of \u03b2-sheet structure, while oligomers formed from several other proteins are reported to be rich in \u03b1-helical structure (<a href=\"#bib25\">Chiti and Dobson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bolognesi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Chimon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Glabe, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Laganowsky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mannini et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lendel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sandberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Stroud et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Chen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Sarkar et al., 2014</a>).

Peptides were cleaved from the resin using standard TFA methods. The peptide disulfide bond was formed via DMSO-based oxidation and peptide purification was achieved by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 preparatory column (<a href=\"#bib4\">Abedini et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Marek et al., 2010b</a>). HCl, rather than TFA, was used as the ion pairing agent since residual TFA can affect IAPP amyloid formation kinetics and can also interfere with 2D IR studies.

The products were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 10\u201320% Tris-tricine gradient gel. Oligomer bands were visualized by silver staining (SilverXpress, Invitrogen). Quantitative analysis was carried out using GelAnalyzer software version 2010a.

If the sample is indeed helical, then one would expect a very strong mean residue ellipticity.

Biochem. 59, 277, 1974 for the method). The authors should comment on whether the CD spectrum indeed has the correct intensity for an \u03b1-helix.

Biol. Chem. 2001, 276, 35176-35184; now cited in the revised manuscript). We have used their approach to show that the observed distribution of oligomers is different from that expected for nonspecific cross-linking of diffusing monomers. Please see reply to reviewer-2 comments 4 & 5 for details. We also conducted additional control experiments to verify that the observed distribution of oligomers is robust (please see reply to reviewer 2 comments 4 & 5 for details). Our data is also compatible with ion mobility mass spectroscopy studies that observed a distribution of monomers to hexamers for both h-IAPP and for r-IAPP (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 660-70; cited in the revised manuscript). The suggestion to compare the non-toxic mutants with h-IAPP is interesting, however we have shown that non-toxic species aggregate and their distribution of oligomers is also very different from what is expected for non-specific \u201crandom\u201d cross-linking. Thus, the non-toxic species studied here cannot be used to distinguish non-specific cross-linking. In fact, we believe one of the interesting aspects of our study is the observation that both toxic and non-toxic forms of IAPP oligomerize. We agree that the HP35* model is not perfect, but it does support our conclusions. We expanded our description of this protein to point out that it was designed to include the same photochemically reactive groups as h-IAPP."

                    "text": "The kinetics of h-IAPP amyloid formation are only weakly dependent upon concentration as has been observed for a number of amyloidogenic proteins. The mechanism of h-IAPP amyloid formation is not known, but a number of amyloidogenic proteins have been shown to follow a weak power law dependence of lag time vs concentration with an exponent of -0.5 (Science, 2009, 326, 1533-1537 and Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 2008, <b>105,</b> 8926-8931). The result is expected for cases where secondary nucleation via fibril breakage is a key event. This mechanism predicts a modest lengthening of the lag time when h-IAPP is diluted from 40 \u00b5M to 28 \u00b5M (as is the case here). The experiments conducted here involved dilution from buffer into cell culture medium (supplemented RPMI at 37<sup>o</sup>C). The rate of h-IAPP amyloid formation is sensitive to ionic strength and to the choice of anion, even for low ionic strengths (Biochemistry 2012 51, 8478-8490). Thus, the small enhancement in lag time caused by dilution would be at least partially canceled out by the moderate change in ionic strength upon dilution into supplemented RPMI. Furthermore, the kinetics of h-IAPP amyloid formation are temperature dependent; a modest increase in temperature slightly decreases the length of the lag phase. We believe that the three small effects (dilution, modest change in ionic strength and modest change in temperature) conspire to lead to only a small change in lag time. We describe this in the caption to <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and in the first paragraph of the subsection \u201cToxic h-IAPP species are transient, pre-amyloid lag phase intermediates that upregulate oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis\u201d. There is another, recently proposed model of h-IAPP amyloid formation that can also rationalize the lack of a significant concentration dependence of the lag time. This model hypothesizes that the lag time is controlled by a significant structural rearrangement within an oligomeric intermediate that involves crossing a high free energy barrier (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2013,110, 19285-90; cited in the revised manuscript]. In this model the energetics of crossing the barrier plays a significant role in dictating the lag time and the proposed rearrangement does not require a change in the association state of the intermediate. The stability of the putative intermediate is not known, but it may be that it is high enough that the small dilution used here does not significantly affect its production. We describe this model in the revised manuscript."

Thus a tradeoff is required between conditions required to obtain structural/biophysical information and conditions that mimic the situation in vivo. Fortunately, this is much less of an issue for h-IAPP than for many other polypeptides. IAPP is stored in the insulin secretory granule where it is found in the halo region of the granule at concentrations estimated to be at or above 500 \u00b5M to 5 mM. Thus, the concentration of IAPP in the granule is actually higher than used in these studies. We added text to the Introduction pointing out the concentration of h-IAPP in the \u03b2-cell secretory granules. The local concentration of h-IAPP will also be high immediately upon release from the granule into the extracellular space within the islet. Dilution into \u03b2-cell/islet culture to 14 \u00b5M is as close a simulation of the in vivo situation, as is possible for an in vitro condition which is compatible with biophysical studies. Although not always appreciated, it is also worth noting that the levels of h-IAPP in transgenic mouse models of islet amyloidosis can be significantly higher than found in non-transgenic organisms since many additional copies of the transgene are present in some models and the transgene is often under control of strong promoters."

If the sample is indeed helical, then one would expect a very strong mean residue ellipticity.

Accurate estimates of the helical content of globular proteins can be estimated from deconvolved CD spectra. This is not likely to be as informative for the sorts of oligomers under investigation here. NMR studies of soluble analogs of IAPP at equilibrium have revealed transient fluctuating helical structure in portions of the molecule (Protein Sci. 2007, 116, 110-117). Short segments of the chain that adopt helical structure in a fluctuating ensemble may not give rise to the full rotational strength expected for a longer helix, and thus can contribute reduced intensity at 222 nm (Biopolymers 1999, 31, 569-586)"

For low efficiency cross-linking the model predicts that the most populated species is the monomer and an approximately exponential decrease in intensity of high order species is predicted. Medium efficiency cross-linking still leads to the monomer being the dominate species, but to a shallower exponential decay in the relative populations. Both cases clearly differ from that observed for h-IAPP. High efficiently cross-linking is predicted to lead to further consumption of monomers and the maximum shifting to dimers with the predicted monomer and dimer populations being higher than the predicted trimer, tetramer and pentamers populations. Again, this distribution is fundamentally different from that observed for IAPP lag phase species, where trimers are the most highly populated species and the population of pentamers is comparable to the population of monomer.
