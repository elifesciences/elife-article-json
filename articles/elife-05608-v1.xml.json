Yet the mechanisms that coordinate this simultaneous opening during every heartbeat are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels form clusters that undergo dynamic, reciprocal, allosteric interactions. This 'functional coupling' facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by increasing activation of adjoined channels and occurs through C-terminal-to-C-terminal interactions. These interactions are initiated by binding of incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> to calmodulin (CaM) and proceed through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 pre-IQ domain. Coupling fades as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decreases, but persists longer than the current that evoked it, providing evidence for 'molecular memory'. Our findings suggest a model for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel gating and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx amplification that unifies diverse observations about Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the heart, and challenges the long-held view that voltage-gated channels open and close independently."
