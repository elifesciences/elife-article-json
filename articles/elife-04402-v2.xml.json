Recently, several groups have shown that feeding-related neurons are sensitive to satiety state but not nutrients in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Marella et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Dus et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Pool et al., 2014</a>).

However, the potential contribution of the enteric neurons in the gastrointestinal tract has not been explored.

Since <i>Ilp7-Gal4</i> is also expressed in the CNS and in neurons projecting to the reproductive organs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Yang et al., 2008</a>), we did similar experiment using <i>HGN1-Gal4</i>, which expresses in the PENSs, but not in the other <i>Ilp7-Gal4</i> neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cognigni et al., 2011</a>), and obtained similar results on glucose levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

Previous work by Miguel-Aliaga and colleagues revealed that silencing <i>Ilp7-Gal4</i> neurons increases defecation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cognigni et al., 2011</a>), which could be the result of increased feeding. We therefore examined the hypothesis that the activities of the PENs regulate food intake. Consistent with the hypothesis, we silenced the PENs in the absence of food and found that this abolished the gains in glucose levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We next investigated this directly using the capillary feeding assay (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ja et al., 2007</a>). Silencing the PENs dramatically increased food intake (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), which is consistent with the gains in glucose levels seen earlier. Conversely, activating these neurons caused dramatic decreases in feeding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Together, manipulation of the activities of the PENs results in an overall six-fold change in feeding in comparison to the controls. This change is significantly larger than alterations by modulation of neuropeptide F signaling (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hong et al., 2012</a>). These data indicate that the activities of the PENs play a prominent role in feeding."

To determine whether the role of the PENs in feeding is related to mechanosensing activity, we first examined the projections of these neurons and found that they tightly wrap around the muscle layer rather than projecting into the lumen of the gut (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

Mutants of the <i>C. elegans</i> DEG/ENaC <i>Mec-4</i> and its <i>Drosophila</i> homolog, <i>PPK1,</i> are touch-insensitive and the affected neurons fail to generate action potentials in response to mechanic tension (<a href=\"#bib17\">O'Hagan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Hwang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Zhong et al., 2010</a>). This raised the possibility that <i>PPK1</i> could be involved in regulating feeding in the PENs. We thus examined <i>PPK1</i> expression using <i>PPK1-Gal4</i> driving mCD8::GFP and confirmed its presence in the PENs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). To test whether the function of <i>PPK1</i> in the PENs is involved in the regulation of feeding, we first assayed the effect of RNAi knockdown of <i>PPK1</i> expression (<i>Ilp7-Gal4 or HGN1-Gal4//UAS-PPK1-RNAi</i>). Knockdown of <i>PPK1</i> in the PENs, but not knockdown of <i>PPK29</i>, a related family member (<a href=\"#bib21\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>), dramatically increased feeding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), phenocopying the effects of silencing these neurons. Next, we examined the effect of <i>PPK1</i> deficiency on feeding and found that <i>PPK1</i> deficient flies have increased food intake (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). This feeding defect is rescued by expressing a <i>PPK1</i> transgene in the PENs (<i>Ilp7-Gal4, UAS- PPK1</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ainsley et al., 2014</a>), <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Finally, pharmacological inhibitor of DEG/ENaCs, benzamil, has been used to antagonize PPK1 in <i>Drosophila</i> and homologs in mice (<a href=\"#bib14\">Liu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Page et al., 2007</a>). We therefore investigated the effect of benzamil on feeding and found it increased food consumption when supplemented in fly food, but not in flies where <i>PPK1</i> is knocked down (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Together, these data indicate that the mechanosensory ion channel, PPK1, plays a critical role in the PENs for regulating feeding."

Enteric DEG/ENaCs provide an attractive alternative for drug development due to their druggability, pharmacological accessibility, and fewer side-effect complications than the central nervous system. Overall, our findings indicate an important role of the DEG/ENaC mechanosensory ion channels in the enteric nervous system in food intake and suggest an exciting therapeutic alternative for fighting obesity."

Of interest, they also show that the channel inhibitor, benzamil, increases feeding in \u201cwild-type\u201d flies but not in flies with neuron-specific knockdown of PPK1. These results are important and will be of significant interest to the research community.\u201d"

The major concern is that the mouse studies as presented are somewhat preliminary and difficult to interpret. The benzamil studies suggest that the drug modestly increases food intake and alters c-fos labeling in the brainstem. The text of the manuscript attributes this effect to alterations in \u201csensing\u201d gastric distention. However, at this point in your study, it is hard to conclude this because the presumed ENaC targets of benzamil are widely expressed, including in the brain. Collectively, the reviewers felt the mouse studies may actually detract from the much more comprehensive and persuasive fly data. It is strongly recommended that either the mouse studies are eliminated from the paper or substantially clarified to overcome these concerns."

In the fly studies, this term refers to neurons that have projections to the gut and send processes to the brain (as in the <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>\u2013figure supplement 1). In the case of mammals, enteric neurons are entirely intrinsic to the gut. Vagal afferents, on the other hand, have projections to the gut and send sensory processes to the brain. It would seem that vagal afferents, and not the enteric nerves, would be analogous to the fly \u201centeric\u201d neurons. Related to the above, it is unclear if the immune-detected channels shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a, b</a> and in the supplementary figures are on the intrinsic enteric neurons or are on the vagal afferent neurons."
