Cytoplasmic dynein, a large and complex AAA+ motor protein (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carter, 2013</a>), uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to move cargoes toward the minus end of microtubules (typically toward the cell center). In addition, dyneins can act while anchored at the cell cortex, where they pull the microtubule network toward them (<a href=\"#bib37\">Moore et al., 2009</a>). Live-cell imaging in diverse organisms reveals that, surprisingly for a minus-end-directed motor, dynein accumulates at the plus ends of microtubules that grow and shrink near the cell periphery (<a href=\"#bib49\">Vaughan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Han et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ma and Chisholm, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sheeman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lenz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kobayashi and Murayama, 2009</a>). By localizing to dynamic microtubule plus ends (<a href=\"#bib20\">Howard and Hyman, 2009</a>), dynein is thought to \u2018search-and-capture\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kirschner and Mitchison, 1986</a>) cargo molecules, before transporting them toward the minus end (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wu et al., 2006</a>). The targeting of the dynein machinery to the microtubule plus end is crucial for proper dynein function in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib37\">Moore et al., 2009</a>), filamentous fungi (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wu et al., 2006</a>), and a subset of metazoan cells, including mammalian neurons (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lomakin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31a\">Lloyd et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Moughamian and Holzbaur, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Moughamian et al., 2013</a>).

Previous studies have illuminated two general mechanisms by which proteins can be targeted to microtubule plus ends. First, a subset of +TIPs preferentially bind to unique structural features present at the plus end vs the body of the microtubule, and can recruit additional proteins to these sites. The prototypical example of this class of +TIP are EBs (end-binding proteins), which are involved in recruiting binding partners such as Clip170 and the dynein regulator dynactin to plus ends in metazoans (<a href=\"#bib51\">Watson and Stephens, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bieling et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dixit et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zanic et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35a\">Maurer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Moughamian et al., 2013</a>). Second, kinesin motor proteins can power the vectorial transport of proteins along the microtubule body to the plus end (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bieling et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Subramanian et al., 2013</a>). These two mechanisms (direct recruitment and vectorial transport) are not mutually exclusive, and evidence suggests that both may contribute to the plus-end targeting of dynein (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wu et al., 2006</a>)."

Deletion of the EB homolog (Bim1) in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> appears to have little effect on the plus-end targeting of dynein and its co-factors (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carvalho et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Caudron et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Markus et al., 2011</a>), despite (1) Bim1 binding directly to Bik1, an essential factor for dynein plus-end targeting (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sheeman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blake-Hodek et al., 2010</a>); and (2) The homologs of Kip2, Bik1 and Bim1 functioning together as a plus-end tracking system in fission yeast (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bieling et al., 2007</a>). While dynein plus-end targeting can persist in the absence of Bim1, it is unknown if Bim1 is involved in the dynein pathway in the native situation, because +TIPs often interact in an interconnected and, in some cases, redundant manner (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caudron et al., 2008</a>). More generally, how a system of molecules can function together to target dynein to the plus end is not clear in any system. This problem is particularly pressing for <i>S. cerevisiae</i> dynein: a forceful minus-end-directed motor with constitutive activity in motility assays (<a href=\"#bib42\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gennerich et al., 2007</a>)."

To test this idea, we devised a microtubule recruitment assay. When wild-type dynein is mixed with microtubules in the absence of nucleotide, it binds strongly to the microtubule, as visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> (lane 1). In order to monitor dynein recruitment to the microtubule by other proteins, we introduced four mutations into its microtubule-binding domain (<a href=\"#bib25\">Koonce and Tikhonenko, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Carter et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Redwine et al., 2012</a>), which severely weakened its association with microtubules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lane 2; see also <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, the weak-binding dynein could be recruited efficiently to the microtubule by the combined presence of Lis1, Bik1, Kip2 and Bim1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lane 3). This dynein recruitment depended strictly on the presence of Lis1 and Bik1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lanes 4 and 5), consistent with the idea that Lis1 and Bik1/Clip170 interact directly (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coquelle et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sheeman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lansbergen et al., 2004</a>). To determine if the reported interaction between Lis1 and the C-terminal zinc-knuckle of Bik1/Clip170 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coquelle et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sheeman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lansbergen et al., 2004</a>) is involved in connecting the dynein-Lis1 and Bik1-Bim1-Kip2 complexes, we purified a Bik1\u0394C construct lacking the C-terminal region. The Bik1\u0394C construct retained the ability to bind Kip2 and Bim1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, its ability to recruit the weak-dynein to the microtubule in the presence of Lis1, Kip2 and Bim1 was abolished (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lane 6). Together, these results suggest that dynein-Lis1 and Bik1-Bim1-Kip2 each form sub-complexes, which in turn interact in a manner dependent on Lis1 and the C-terminal region of Bik1."

These residues are depicted in red sphere representation using the cryo-EM derived model of dynein's microtubule-binding domain bound to an \u03b1/\u03b2-tubulin dimer (PDB 3J1T) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Redwine et al., 2012</a>). The inset shows the location of dynein's microtubule-binding domain (boxed) in relation to the rest of the molecule. (<b>B</b>) These mutations substantially weaken, but do not abolish, the binding of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> dynein to the microtubule in the absence of nucleotide, as shown by a microtubule co-sedimentation assay. Under conditions in which wild-type (WT) dynein is fully bound to the microtubule ([\u03b1/\u03b2-tubulin]: 600 nM), the weak binding mutant only partially co-sediments with the microtubule in the pellet (P) and partially remains in the supernatant (S). See also <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>. (<b>C</b>) In the presence of Lis1, Bik1, Bim1 and Kip2, both the WT and weak binding dynein constructs are transported by Kip2 to the plus-end of the microtubule (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, the plus-end velocity of the weak-binding construct is increased relative to the wild-type dynein (p&lt;0.0001, Student's <i>t</i> test), becoming close to that of free Kip2. This suggests that wild-type dynein can resist its own transport to the plus end through its microtubule-binding domain."

To test this model, we repeated the reconstitution using the dynein mutant engineered to have weak affinity for the microtubule. Strikingly, the plus-end velocity of the weak-binding dynein was increased relative to the wild-type protein, becoming close to that of Kip2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

However, by exploiting the weak-binding dynein construct that does not bind appreciably to the microtubule at low nanomolar concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lane 2), we were able to observe clear co-localized movements of dynein with Kip2 in the presence of Bik1 and Lis1 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Notably, the dynein construct frequently localized with Kip2 midway through a run, and dissociated before its end, consistent with transient binding as indicated by our biochemical experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

Lis1 and Bik1 were critical for dynein's plus-end-directed movement (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, lanes 3 and 4). In their absence, dynein moved to the minus end of the microtubule, despite the continued movement of Kip2 to the plus end. These results indicate that Lis1 and Bik1 are required to connect dynein to Kip2. Omitting Kip2 abolished dynein's plus-end-directed movement, showing that the pathway we have reconstituted is kinesin dependent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, lane 5). Interestingly, removal of Kip2 also increased the frequency of microtubule catastrophes (the conversion from growth to shrinkage; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, arrows), consistent with the short microtubule phenotype caused by Kip2 deletion in vivo (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cottingham and Hoyt, 1997</a>). Finally, we observed an unexpected influence of Bim1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, lane 6). In the absence of Bim1, dynein could still be transported to the plus end, but the fraction of plus- vs minus-end-directed dynein movements was roughly balanced (47 vs 53 \u00b1 5%, respectively). Thus, Lis1, Bik1 and Kip2 constitute the minimal machinery for transporting dynein to the plus end, and Bim1 can regulate this machinery to increase the fraction of dynein movements that are directed to the plus end."

Furthermore, analysis of the Kip2 amino acid sequence revealed that there is an SxIP motif within an extension N-terminal to the kinesin motor domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The SxIP motif is a signature sequence that interacts with EB-family proteins such as Bim1 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Honnappa et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that Bim1 may interact with Kip2 through this motif. Bim1 also binds to the Cap-Gly domain of Bik1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blake-Hodek et al., 2010</a>) and the microtubule lattice (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zimniak et al., 2009</a>), while Bik1's coiled coil is thought to interact with Kip2 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Newman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carvalho et al., 2004</a>).

The essence of the mechanism involves coupling dynein's motor domain to a plus-end-directed kinesin, Kip2. By reconstituting the functional coupling between these opposite-polarity motors for the first time, we show that two proteins, Lis1 and Bik1, are sufficient to connect dynein and Kip2. This connection is capable of bearing load on the microtubule, but is not stable enough to be observed by size-exclusion chromatography. As is the case for interactions found in other self-organizing systems (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kirschner et al., 2000</a>), a high off-rate between dynein and Kip2 might allow for dynamic regulation, for example enabling dynein to readily detach from Kip2 following targeting. Indeed, in vivo, the timescale of dynein \u2018offloading\u2019 from the microtubule plus end onto its receptor on the cell cortex is on the order of seconds (<a href=\"#bib33\">Markus and Lee, 2011</a>)."

Specifically, Lis1's \u00df-propeller domain binds to the AAA4 subdomain of dynein's motor domain (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). The dynein/Lis1 complex interacts dynamically with the C-terminal zinc-knuckle domain of Bik1/Clip170 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coquelle et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sheeman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lansbergen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Markus et al., 2011</a>) as indicated by the double arrow. Bik1's coiled coil is posited to interact with Kip2 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Newman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carvalho et al., 2004</a>). Bim1 is not strictly required for dynein's plus-end transport, but together with Bik1, it can enhance Kip2's processivity and help Kip2 overcome dynein's intrinsic minus-end-directed motility. As depicted with dotted lines, it is likely that the C-terminal tail of Bim1 interacts with the N-terminal Cap-Gly domain of Bik1 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Weisbrich et al., 2007</a>), and the cargo-binding domain of Bim1 interacts with the SxIP motif of Kip2 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Honnappa et al., 2009</a>). This arrangement would leave the calponin-homolgy domain of Bim1 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Slep and Vale, 2007</a>) free to interact transiently with the microtubule lattice, and thus promote Kip2's microtubule association. A single copy of each molecule is shown for clarity; interplay with the numerous other + TIPs in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (not shown) is expected."

Bik1 and Bim1 can promote Kip2's microtubule interactions and help this kinesin to overcome dynein's intrinsic minus-end-directed motility. The effect of these factors is recapitulated when dynein and Kip2 are connected synthetically using DNA origami, suggesting that it is mechanical in its basis and not contingent on a specific coupling geometry. Moreover, our biochemical demonstration of Kip2 phosphorylation suggests that additional layers of regulation may exist. Specifically, the addition and removal of phosphate groups on the N-terminal extension of Kip2's motor domain has the potential to influence its interaction with Bim1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Honnappa et al., 2009</a>), as well as the negatively charged microtubule surface, both of which could impact Kip2 motility."

For example, dynein's tail domain is crucial for events downstream of plus-end targeting (<a href=\"#bib35\">Markus et al., 2009</a>), but it is conceivable that the tail and its associated factors regulate the transport process as well. Once dynein reaches the plus end, the high local concentration of Lis1 at plus ends in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Markus et al., 2011</a>) may help retain dynein by prolonging its microtubule attachments (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McKenney et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53a\">Yamada et al., 2008</a>). Nudel, a Lis1 and dynein binding partner, may also promote dynein plus-end targeting by tethering Lis1 to dynein (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McKenney et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wang and Zheng, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zylkiewicz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Notably, genetic studies indicate there is a second pathway for targeting dynein directly from the cytoplasm to the plus end that does not require Kip2 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caudron et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Markus et al., 2009</a>). Overlap between these pathways in vivo may explain why Bim1's capacity to regulate dynein plus-end transport was previously hidden. In summary, these results provide a vivid example of how the interplay between dynein, kinesin and microtubule-associated proteins can give rise to a coherent behavior: the recycling of a molecular motor to the start of its track."

Harvested cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Kip2 was typically affinity purified via its ZZ-tag as described for dynein (<a href=\"#bib42\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>). For fluorescent labeling of the SNAP tag on Kip2, benzyl-guanine (BG) conjugated Atto647N dye (NEB; Ipswich, MA) was added to a final concentration of 10\u201330 \u03bcM while the Kip2 was bound to IgG-sepharose beads and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at ambient temperature. DNA labeling of Kip2 was carried out in the same way using 60 \u03bcM BG-oligonucleotide. After returning the mixture to 4\u00b0C, unbound dye/DNA was removed by two washes with TEV buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, and 0.1 mM Mg-ATP). Kip2 was released from beads via incubation with TEV protease for 1 hr at 16\u00b0C, resulting in cleavage from the His8-ZZ tag."

Following the addition of 10 vol of BRB80, polymerized seeds were pelleted in a benchtop centrifuge (15 min at 16,100\u00d7<i>g</i>) and resuspended in a volume of BRB80 equal to the original polymerization volume. Flow chambers for TIRF microscopy were assembled using biotin-PEG cover glasses. Chambers were incubated sequentially with the following solutions, interspersed with two washes with assay buffer: (1) 1% plurionic F-127 and 5 mg/ml casein in BRB80 (8 min incubation); (2) 0.5 mg/ml streptavidin in BRB80 (4 min incubation); (3) a fresh 1:2000 dilution of microtubule seed solution (2 min incubation). The final reaction solution contained 1 mM Mg-ATP, 1 mM GTP, 0.1% methylcellulose, an oxygen scavenging system, and 15 \u03bcM tubulin (7.5% Alexa488 labeled, 92.5% unlabeled) in assay buffer. Dynein-TMR (0.04\u20130.3 nM), Lis1 (50 nM), Bim1 (5 nM), Bik1 (50 nM) and Kip2-Atto647 (1 nM) were added as indicated. After sealing with vacuum grease, flow chambers were imaged immediately. Three-color TIRF movies (capturing Alexa488, TMR and Atto647 fluorescence) were recorded with 3 s intervals per channel for 10 min using the microscopy setup described above and in <a href=\"#bib41\">Qiu et al. (2012)</a>. Microtubule plus ends were assigned based on two criteria, which were consistent: (1) the direction of Kip2 movement and (2) the microtubule end with faster growth rate. Only motility on the dimly labeled plus-end extension of the microtubule was analyzed. Dynein velocities and directionalities were calculated from kymographs using an ImageJ macro (provided in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The density of Kip2 on the microtubule precluded measuring the velocity of every run in each kymograph. Hence the velocity of a subset of discrete runs was determined as an estimate of the population velocity. These velocities match closely those of Kip2 at single-molecule concentrations in equivalent conditions (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In some cases, minor image drift was corrected using the ImageJ plugin <i>Turboreg</i>. Movies showing significant drift were discarded."

Atto647-labeled Kip2 (0.01\u20130.05 nM) was added with Bik1 (100 nM) and Bim1 (5 nM) as indicated, in BRB80 supplemented with 1 mM Mg-ATP, 1 mM DTT, 20 \u03bcM taxol, 2.5 mg/ml casein, and an oxygen scavenging system. Motility assays were imaged as described (<a href=\"#bib12\">Derr et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Motor velocities and run lengths were calculated from kymographs. For landing rate quantification, Kip2 was analyzed at 0.01 and 0.02 nM in the presence or absence of Bik1 (100 nM) and Bim1 (5 nM). Landing events were determined from kymographs and the rate was calculated as the number of events per micron of microtubule per nM Kip2 per minute."

The folded chassis was purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation as described (<a href=\"#bib12\">Derr et al., 2012</a>). The chassis contained five TAMRA-labeled ssDNAs for fluorescent visualization. The chassis also had two projecting \u2018handle\u2019 sequences of ssDNA at opposite ends, termed \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, which were used to attach DNA-labeled dynein and Kip2 respectively. The sequences for the scaffold and all oligonucleotides are listed in <a href=\"#bib12\">Derr et al. (2012)</a>. Motor-chassis complexes were assembled by incubating dynein labeled with oligo A\u2032 (complementary to handle A) and Kip2 labeled with oligo B\u2032 (complementary to handle B) with the chassis for 30 min on ice. Complex assembly was verified by agarose gel shift (<a href=\"#bib12\">Derr et al., 2012</a>). Chassis motility was visualized in the presence of Bik1 (100 nM) and Bim1 (5 nM) on taxol-stabilized microtubules as indicated. To determine microtubule polarity, a low concentration (\u223c0.1 nM) of a highly processive dynein mutant (E3197K) labeled with a different fluorophore (Atto647) was included. Chassis velocities and directionalities were determined from kymographs using ImageJ. To determine the fraction of motile events, the number of observations for a given event (e.g., the number of plus end runs) was tallied and divided by the total number of observations. Fractions are expressed as the average percentage \u00b1 SEM for three separate dynein/Kip2-chassis assembly reactions, with 306\u2013353 runs analyzed in each case."

Our biochemical experiments suggest that dynein-Lis1 and Bik1-Bim1-Kip2 interact, but do not form a stable complex even at micromolar concentrations. Thus, when performing single-molecule co-localization experiments, we have to consider the \u201cconcentration problem\u201d (van Oijen A.M., 2011, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 22: 75-80): when both species are diluted to the picomolar concentrations required for single-molecule imaging on the microtubule, the chance of observing a binding event between them is extremely small."

Conversely, if dynein is used at nanomolar concentration and Kip2 is at picomolar concentrations, dynein runs are too dense to resolve colocalization. To overcome this, we exploited the weak binding dynein mutant that does not bind appreciably to the microtubule even at nanomolar concentrations. This allowed us to use an elevated dynein concentration and a Kip2 concentration suitable for single-molecule imaging. We observed clear co-localized runs on the microtubule, suggesting that Kip2 directly drives dynein\u2019s plus-end-directed movement."

However, three lines of evidence argue against this possibility: 1) The weak binding dynein mutant, in which four charged amino acids have been mutated to alanine, does not bind microtubules appreciably (even in the absence of nucleotide, which corresponds to the highest affinity state in dynein\u2019s mechanochemical cycle). It seems very unlikely that the binding of Bim1-Bik1-Kip2 to weak dynein could modulate its ability to bind microtubules, because its microtubule-binding domain is intrinsically impaired. 2) In these experiments microtubules are preformed and taxol stabilized, making lattice changes unlikely. 3) We present new data showing that removal of the C-terminal 40 amino acids of Bik1 previously reported to interact with Lis1 abolishes recruitment of weak dynein to the microtubule (new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) but has no effect on its ability to bind Kip2 and Bim1. Together with the new co-localization data, these points all indicate that Lis1 and Bik1 couple dynein to Kip2, and Kip2 drives dynein\u2019s movement toward the plus end directly."

We use the recruitment of the weak -binding dynein construct to the microtubule as a diagnostic for interactions between dynein and its plus-end-transport machinery (we did not mean to imply that dynein is recruited to the microtubule in the same way in the in vivo situation). We believe the observation that more dynein is required to observe a similar density of runs in the absence of Bik1 and Lis1 reflects the fact that, in the presence of Kip2, there are fewer microtubule binding sites available to dynein since Kip2 and dynein compete for the same site on the microtubule. In the presence of Bik1 and Lis1, which couple dynein to Kip2, the need for dynein to bind the microtubule directly is bypassed, and lower dynein concentrations are required to observe binding events."

We have clarified that we used GST to dimerize dynein\u2019s motor domain, and the resulting motor has motile properties highly similar to full-length dynein (<a href=\"#bib42\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>). We aimed to stress in our original text that additional factors, such as dynein\u2019s tail domain, have the potential to regulate the system we have reconstituted. We now state: \u201cIt remains to be seen if additional factors mitigate resistance from dynein during its plus-end transport in vivo, akin to the mutations in dynein\u2019s microtubule-binding domain that we found to enhance plus-end targeting in vitro. For example, dynein\u2019s tail domain is crucial for events downstream of plus-end-targeting (<a href=\"#bib35\">Markus et al., 2009</a>), but it is conceivable that the tail and its associated factors regulate the transport process as well.\u201d"
