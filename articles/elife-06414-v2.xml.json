Several channel types can mediate dendritically initiated spikes (dSpikes), which may impact information processing and storage across multiple timescales; however, the roles of different channels in the rapid vs long-term effects of dSpikes are unknown. We show here that dSpikes mediated by Na<sub>v</sub> channels (blocked by a low concentration of TTX) are required for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the distal apical dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, imaging, simulations, and buffering experiments all support a model whereby fast Na<sub>v</sub> channel-mediated dSpikes (Na-dSpikes) contribute to LTP induction by promoting large, transient, localized increases in intracellular calcium concentration near the calcium-conducting pores of NMDAR and L-type Ca<sub>v</sub> channels. Thus, in addition to contributing to rapid neural processing, Na-dSpikes are likely to contribute to memory formation via their role in long-lasting synaptic plasticity."

Several channel types can mediate dendritically initiated spikes (dSpikes), which may impact information processing and storage across multiple timescales; however, the roles of different channels in the rapid vs long-term effects of dSpikes are unknown. We show here that dSpikes mediated by Na<sub>v</sub> channels (blocked by a low concentration of TTX) are required for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the distal apical dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, imaging, simulations, and buffering experiments all support a model whereby fast Na<sub>v</sub> channel-mediated dSpikes (Na-dSpikes) contribute to LTP induction by promoting large, transient, localized increases in intracellular calcium concentration near the calcium-conducting pores of NMDAR and L-type Ca<sub>v</sub> channels. Thus, in addition to contributing to rapid neural processing, Na-dSpikes are likely to contribute to memory formation via their role in long-lasting synaptic plasticity."

Thus, the finding that synaptic plasticity often has properties compatible with Hebbian learning has been a powerful driver of experimental and theoretical studies of changes in synaptic weights. The simple idea is that coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity results in changes in synaptic strength such as long-term potentiation (LTP). Many in vitro studies support a model in which modifiable synapses detect presynaptic activity through glutamate binding to postsynaptic receptors and detect postsynaptic activity through depolarization, which relieves magnesium block of <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) and activates voltage-gated calcium (Ca<sub>v</sub>) channels. Both of these effects mediate postsynaptic calcium entry, which is believed to be a critical activator of the biochemical steps necessary for increases in synaptic strength (<a href=\"#bib76\">Madison et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bliss and Collingridge, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Blackstone and Sheng, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cavazzini et al., 2005</a>). Four decades of research have led to this general picture, but important questions about the events leading to the critical calcium entry remain unanswered."

However, all three mechanisms may exist in the brain, for example, in different cell types or even within the same cell at different synapses, different stages of development, or possibly in response to different activation patterns at the same synapse. Such heterogeneity would be consistent with the idea that LTP is not a single phenomenon, but rather a collection of mechanisms that can produce a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength (<a href=\"#bib85\">Malenka and Bear, 2004</a>)."

In the first case, the synapses that drive action potential firing could be located anywhere in the dendritic tree and plasticity would occur at all synapses that experience significant depolarization as a result of the bAP. This is the most conventional interpretation of Hebbian LTP. In the second and third conditions, synapses have to be co-localized in the dendrites in order to depolarize each other sufficiently to produce Hebbian LTP. In these conditions, the postsynaptic axon does not have to \u2018fire\u2019 at all; the third condition additionally requires that the co-localized synapses produce enough depolarization to trigger a dSpike, which may occur with or without axonal firing. Although these conditions may still be classified as \u2018Hebbian LTP\u2019, because of the requirement for co-incident presynaptic and postsynaptic activation, the existence of LTP under these conditions would imply that Hebbian-like LTP occurs at finer spatial scales than the more cell-wide form that most current models employ. Thus, during behavior, neurons that fire may undergo LTP, but even a neuron that is synaptically activated but axonally silent during a behavioral event can be recruited to participate in the neural engram."

This suggests that if synaptic plasticity contributes to reshaping the network upon initial exposure to a new environment, it need not be conventional Hebbian plasticity, but rather a modified form of Hebbian plasticity that does not require axonal firing, such as the second and third conditions described above. Consistent with this idea, hippocampal neurons receive spatially tuned synaptic inputs even when they are silent (<a href=\"#bib67\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). Understanding whether and how such inputs can drive synaptic plasticity will be an important step toward understanding how spatial memories are formed in the hippocampus."

Three types of dSpikes have been described, which have been named according to the primary channel type supporting the regenerative event: dendritic sodium spikes (Na-dSpikes) and dendritic calcium spikes (Ca-dSpikes) are mediated primarily by voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels and Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, respectively, while dendritic NMDA spikes (NMDA-dSpikes) are mediated primarily by NMDAR channels (<a href=\"#bib110\">Schwartzkroin and Slawsky, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Andreasen and Lambert, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Schiller et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Golding et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Larkum et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib116\">Spruston, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Larkum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Major et al., 2013</a>).

Furthermore, the importance of dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channels and Na-dSpikes has not been addressed, mostly because these channels are essential for action potential firing in presynaptic axons and terminals, thus making it difficult to block them without inhibiting synaptic transmission."

This strategy works because the density of Na<sub>v</sub> channels is much lower in dendrites than in axons. As a result, the safety factor for spike initiation is lower in dendrites, so partial block of Na<sub>v</sub> channels affects postsynaptic (dendritic) dSpikes much more than presynaptic (axonal) action potentials (<a href=\"#bib74\">Mackenzie and Murphy, 1998</a>). Using this strategy, we demonstrate that Na-dSpikes are necessary for the induction of LTP in response to theta-burst stimulation (TBS) of the PP synapses in the apical tuft dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and we offer an explanation for why these spikes are an essential mechanism."

We adjusted stimulus intensity to yield single PP \u2192 CA1<sub>tuft</sub> excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) of 3\u201310 mV at the soma, which likely corresponds to activation of several tens of synapses onto the apical tuft dendrites of the recorded neuron (<a href=\"#bib37\">Golding et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib133\">Nicholson et al., 2006</a>). We chose 20 nM TTX (henceforth \u2018low TTX\u2019) because it was the highest concentration we could use without obviously reducing the size of EPSPs. The IC<sub>50</sub> of TTX on Na<sub>v</sub> channels has been estimated as 6\u201310 nM in dissociated hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib56\">Kaneda et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Madeja, 2000</a>), but it may be higher for slice experiments due to limited drug penetration in brain slices. Single EPSPs in response to low-frequency (single shock) stimulation were not affected by bath application of low TTX (control: 4.57 \u00b1 0.36 mV, low TTX: 5.02 \u00b1 0.49 mV, n = 7; p &gt; 0.05 by Student's t-test; data not shown). We also tested the effects of low TTX on the responses to low-frequency or high-frequency (5 stimuli at 100 Hz) activation of the PP, while using localized application of a higher concentration of TTX (10 \u00b5M in the application pipette) to the vicinity of the soma and proximal axons (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) in order to prevent somatic or axonal action potential initiation. Bath application of low TTX had no significant effect on PP \u2192 CA1<sub>tuft</sub> EPSPs in response to either type of stimulation, across a wide range of stimulus intensities resulting in EPSPs from \u223c3 mV (single shock) up to \u223c27 mV (high-frequency burst; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013G</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). These results suggest that excitatory synaptic transmission is not affected by bath application of low TTX within the range of stimulus intensities and frequencies tested here."

Dendritic recording is necessary to increase the probability of detecting dSpikes originating in the apical tuft, because their steep attenuation makes them impossible to detect hundreds of microns away in somatic recordings. We used a stimulus pattern known to cause dSpikes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Golding et al., 2002</a>), which consisted of PP stimulation in high-frequency bursts (5 stimuli at 100 Hz), repeated five times at theta frequency (5 Hz; a \u2018theta-burst stimulation\u2019, TBS, consisting of 25 stimuli in total).

Observations of events with amplitudes in between those of large dSpikes and small dSpikes (spikelets) are rare, because the transition from a large dSpike to a small dSpike occurs over very short distances due to the large attenuation at branch points (<a href=\"#bib58\">Katz et al., 2009</a>). Accordingly, we observed a large gap in the distribution of event amplitudes, with no events having amplitudes in the 30\u201340 mV range (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). Small dSpikes (spikelets) were distinguishable from the cases without any regenerative events (i.e., EPSPs only) because they had larger dV/dt values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>; see below and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

In this way, we could determine whether conclusions about the effects of low TTX on dSpikes were dependent on the definition used."

We next turned our attention to investigating the calcium entry that links Na-dSpikes with the induction of PP \u2192 CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP. Given that NMDAR and L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels are both voltage-dependent sources of calcium entry, and they both contribute to PP \u2192 CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP (approximately equally, see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), the most parsimonious hypothesis is that Na-dSpikes are effective activators of calcium entry via these pathways. Although LTP induction at these synapses may depend on the complex spatiotemporal properties of calcium entry, the simplest scenario is that Na-dSpikes produce particularly large calcium entry in synaptically activated portions of the tuft dendrites, which triggers LTP."

Alternatively, during synaptic activation, Na<sub>v</sub> channels may affect membrane potential and calcium entry in spines independently of dSpikes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Araya et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2007</a>; note that blocking Na<sub>v</sub> channels enhanced synaptic calcium influx in <a href=\"#bib12\">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2007</a>). Finally, TTX may have a presynaptic effect, as presynaptic sodium has been shown to regulate synaptic strength constitutively at the Calyx of Held (<a href=\"#bib51\">Huang and Trussell, 2014</a>). A few observations argue against these possibilities, such as the lack of effect of low TTX on synaptic responses at PP \u2192 CA1<sub>tuft</sub> synapses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the strong correlation between dSpikes and PP \u2192 CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP (<a href=\"#bib35\">Golding et al., 2002</a>) and the reduction in Na-dSpikes that accompanies the block of PP \u2192 CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP by low TTX (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 3</a>).

The affinity and co-operativity of the calcium sensor would have to be matched to the spatiotemporal features of the calcium concentration profiles near the mouths of NMDAR and L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels in response to TBS. The affinity of the sensor would need to be relatively low, in order to respond <i>only</i> to the high calcium concentration near the calcium-conducting pores during a large Na-dSpike.

Importantly, experimentally observed Hill coefficients are indeed high enough for this operation; for example, assuming a Hill coefficient of 4, a modest dSpike-driven difference in peak I<sub>Ca</sub> (\u223ctwofold; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) would increase calcium sensor activation from 20% to 80%. The identities of the calcium sensors and the downstream biochemistry leading to LTP induction are the subjects of ongoing research (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amici et al., 2009</a>), but calmodulin may have the properties necessary to serve this function, namely low affinity, rapid binding kinetics, and high cooperativity for calcium binding (<a href=\"#bib26\">Faas et al., 2011</a>).

Dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channels play a central role in the cellular implementation of this rule, by determining which postsynaptic neurites fire."

As dV/dt is proportional to membrane current, the initial phase slope can be conceptualized as the <i>apparent</i> voltage sensitivity of membrane current. It is an <i>apparent</i> voltage sensitivity because the source of the current (e.g., the Na<sub>v</sub> channels) and the membrane potential responsible for the current are at a remote location, and therefore the observed voltage sensitivity does not necessarily reflect the voltage dependence of the activation of the channels per se. In dendritic recordings, actively propagating spikes initiated in the axon (i.e., bAPs) typically have a sharp \u2018kink\u2019 at their onset, because they are initiated by axial current flowing from a remote location of spike initiation (i.e., the axon), which precedes local dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channel-mediated currents. The \u2018kink\u2019 is reflected as a large initial phase slope (&gt;3.5 ms<sup>-1</sup>), and thus a steep apparent voltage sensitivity of the membrane current, because the axial current is driven by the voltage difference between the axon and the dendrite, thus resulting in a current that is not driven by changes in the local dendritic depolarization and therefore does not require activation of local channels. As a result of this sudden current, the onset of these backpropagating spikes shows a kink in the time domain and a steep initial slope in the phase domain. In contrast, large dSpikes have a more gradual onset, because they are initiated by local Na<sub>v</sub> channel-mediated currents generated closer to the dendritic recording electrode, and therefore the voltage sensitivity of the membrane current (as measured by initial phase slope) more accurately reflects the voltage sensitivity of the Na<sub>v</sub> channels (<a href=\"#bib111\">Shu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib130\">Yu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Brette, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib113\">Smith et al., 2013</a>)."

We observed a trend toward decay of peak dV/dt in each burst as a function of stimulus position (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Therefore, we normalized peak dV/dt to the median value for Stim. #1 in control (i.e., of the five bursts in control from the given cell) and plotted normalized dV/dt as a function of stimulus position in each burst in control and in the presence of 20 nM TTX. A fit of an exponential decay function to the whole population of data (control and 20 nM TTX) was then performed. Small dSpikes were identified as events that fell outside the prediction band of the fit; in this way, a single criterion was applied to both experimental conditions (i.e., control and 20 nM TTX). Because there is no perfectly objective way to determine which events should be called small dSpikes, we analyzed the data for prediction bands at confidence levels ranging from 85% (least stringent; largest number of small dSpikes) to 99% (most stringent; smallest number of small dSpikes). Two additional statistical criteria (based on the median or standard deviation of normalized peak dV/dt for each stimulus position; data not shown) and another approach applying a single \u2018hard\u2019 threshold (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) for identifying small dSpikes were also used, and the qualitative results remained the same."

Earlier work from this lab demonstrated the remarkable electrical isolation of distal dendrites from the rest of CA1 pyramidal cells, in which local spikes play an important role in local computations, and are also important in triggering LTP. The background for this study is the nature of these dendritic spikes. Dendrites are capable of a number of regenerative processes, including sodium spikes, high threshold calcium spikes and NMDAR-dependent \u201cspikes\u201d. The authors conclude that 20 nM TTX selectively inhibits dendritic spikes without any apparent effect on the amplitude of subthreshold synaptic responses. The low dose of TTX is surprisingly effective in blocking theta burst LTP, which is dependent on calcium influx through NMDA receptors and L-type voltage gated calcium channels. The authors present evidence that the sodium spikes engage L-type calcium channels as well as unblock NMDARs, both of which contribute to LTP."

We found the largest possible peak \u0394G/R values (observed when TBS was paired with somatic current injection to evoke bAPs) were well above the largest \u0394G/R in response to single high-frequency burst stimulation in our dataset, and the dye was not saturated by a single burst in general because calcium responses were able to facilitate upon delivery of additional bursts in TBS (five bursts) with the ratio \u0394G/R <sub>(Max)</sub>: \u0394G/R <sub>(1st burst)</sub> = 1.52 \u00b1 0.31 (n = 4 cells, in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig11\">Author response image 1</a>).

However, the lack of effect of Ni<sup>2+</sup> on LTP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) makes it seem unlikely that a component of calcium influx attributable to T-type or R-type Ca<sub>v</sub> channels contributes to LTP. The contribution of N-type or P/Q-type channels is difficult to address, owing to the critical roles of these channels in presynaptic release."
