Many behaviors occur at food sites, yet how food odors regulate such behaviors at these sites is unclear. Using <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> as an animal model, we found that males deposit the pheromone 9-tricosene upon stimulation with the food-odor apple cider vinegar. This pheromone acts as a potent aggregation pheromone and as an oviposition guidance cue for females. We use genetic, molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches to show that 9-tricosene activates antennal basiconic Or7a receptors, a receptor activated by many alcohols and aldehydes such as the green leaf volatile E2-hexenal. We demonstrate that loss of Or7a positive neurons or the Or7a receptor abolishes aggregation behavior and oviposition site-selection towards 9-tricosene and E2-hexenal. 9-Tricosene thus functions via Or7a to link food-odor perception with aggregation and egg-laying decisions."

Living organisms are also a source of odorants, broadly termed pheromones, which play important roles in olfactory communications between different organisms of the same species (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wilson, 1970</a>). Despite a wealth of knowledge of pheromone identities and their physiological functions, how environmental cues interact with pheromone signaling is not well understood."

Aggregation behavior may reduce interspecific competition and also be important for finding mates (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hedlund et al., 1996</a>). However, how aggregation pheromones are induced or deposited to mark certain geographical location and modulate animal behaviors remains largely unknown. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, aggregation behavior has been observed at locations that contain male flies and food substrates. The male specific pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) has been implicated as the key aggregation pheromone that attracts both males and females (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bartelt et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Xu et al., 2005</a>). cVA is manufactured and stored in an internal male organ (ejaculatory bulb) and transferred to females during copulation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brieger and Butterworth, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Everaerts et al., 2010</a>), where it plays a role in inhibiting male courtship of previously mated females (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ejima et al., 2007</a>). Low levels of cVA may be present on males prior to mating (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bartelt et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Farine et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, flies defective in sensing cVA exhibit residual aggregation behavior, suggesting the existence of an aggregation compound besides cVA from male flies (<a href=\"#bib67\">Xu et al., 2005</a>)."

Given the chemical nature of long chain hydrocarbons, most cuticular hydrocarbons are not volatile and are instead detected by gustatory contact (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ferveur et al., 1997</a>). For instance, 7-tricosene, an abundant male cuticular hydrocarbon, functions as an aphrodisiac for females and anti-aphrodisiac for males and is sensed via the gustatory system (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>). Nonetheless, recent solid-phase micro-extraction gas chromatography experiments indicated the presence of volatile cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones, suggesting pheromone detection might be medicated through the olfactory system (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ferveur et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Farine et al., 2012</a>). All together, these studies suggest an uncharacterized cuticular hydrocarbon might function as an aggregation pheromone and possibly signal via the olfactory system."

                        "text": "Understanding how volatile pheromones may affect animal behavior is aided by identifying the odorant receptors activated by that pheromone. Studies using cuticular extracts or flies as odor sources identified neurons within trichoid sensilla as responding most robustly to <i>Drosophila</i> pheromones (<a href=\"#bib62\">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007</a>). The pheromones activating each of the four pheromone receptors (Or67d, Or65a, Or88a, Or47b) have now been identified: cVA robustly activates Or67d (<a href=\"#bib9\">Benton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ejima et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kurtovic et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Laughlin et al., 2008</a>) and, to a lesser degree, Or65a (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ejima et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 2011</a>); and fatty acid methyl ethers methyl laurate, methyl myristate, and methyl palmitate activate Or88a (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dweck et al., 2015a</a>), whereas only methyl laurate activates Or47b (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dweck et al., 2015b</a>). In each case, the pheromone receptor is specifically tuned to respond only to the identified pheromones, and exhibit little response to a large panel of other odorants (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dweck et al., 2015a</a>). In addition, the pheromones activate only the identified pheromone receptors, and show little effect on other olfactory receptors."

                        "text": "Here, we report the finding that male flies deposit an aggregation pheromone onto their surroundings upon apple cider vinegar odor and food odor stimulation. The pheromone, 9-tricosene, is a volatile male-specific cuticular hydrocarbon and requires the olfactory, but not gustatory, system for detection. By electrophysiological and behavior studies, we identify the Or7a olfactory neurons housed in basiconic sensilla as being necessary and sufficient for 9-tricosene pheromone detection. This is surprising as Or7a, in contrast to previously characterized pheromone receptors, can be classified as a \u2018generalist\u2019 odorant receptor as it can respond to many aldehydes and alcohols (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>). Behaviorally, 9-tricosene promotes aggregation and modulates female oviposition site selection- a behavior that was previously considered a female exclusive decision (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Joseph et al., 2009</a>). The green leaf volatile E2-hexenal, a previously characterized robust Or7a agonist (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hallem et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>), can also guide Or7a-dependent attraction and egg-laying decisions. Three additional Or7a odor agonists could also guide positive oviposition site selection, suggesting that Or7a neuron activation might directly influence this behavior. Indeed, selective optogenetic stimulation of Or7a neurons was also sufficient to guide egg-laying site selection. Our study provides important insights into biological communication by identifying an olfactory mechanism that links together food-odor perception, male pheromone deposition, species aggregation, and female oviposition decision-making."

We modified a four-field olfactory arena and fly tracking system (<a href=\"#bib54\">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ronderos et al., 2014</a>) to monitor large fly populations responding to odors over a large arena space. Flies are contained in a star-shaped arena between two glass plates (See Materials and methods for details), tracked in a dark chamber using infrared illumination (which is invisible to flies), and detected by an infrared camera (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We validated our experimental design by monitoring attraction to apple cider vinegar, repulsion to citronellal, and neutral responses to clean air (<a href=\"#fig1s1 fig1s2 fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133</a>).

To rule out the possibility of passive pheromone deposition onto the glass plates due to crowding of many flies into a small space, flies were corralled into the odor quadrant by attraction to humidified air and monitored for post-stimulus aggregation behavior. Under these conditions, there was no detectable post-stimulus aggregation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>).

As a further test, we examined stimulus attraction by a prominent attractive monomolecular odorant of apple cider vinegar: ethyl acetate. Although this odorant was highly attractive, it failed to generate post-stimulus aggregation behaviors (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>).

The aggregation pheromone was equally attractive to both virgin and mated males and females (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>)."

                                "text": "Pheromones are detected by the olfactory and gustatory systems (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amrein, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wyatt, 2014</a>). Since the pheromone is deposited onto the glass plates, it might be detected by either chemosensory system. We utilized genetic mutants that are defective in specific modes of chemosensory signaling as detectors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). <i>Poxn</i> mutants, which exhibit no functional gustatory receptor neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Awasaki and Kimura, 2001</a>), were as attracted as wild-type animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>), suggesting that the gustatory system is not necessary for post-stimulus aggregation. Pickpocket channel 23 (ppk23), a Degenerin/epithelial sodium channel, is necessary for the detection of a male-predominant cuticular hydrocarbon, 7-tricosene (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>). <i>ppk23</i> mutants exhibited similar post-stimulus aggregation compared to wild-type animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), suggesting Ppk23 function is not necessary for aggregation and that 7-tricosene is unlikely to be the aggregation pheromone. Most insect olfactory receptors require a coreceptor(s) for normal olfactory responses: <i>Orco</i> for Odorant Receptors (<a href=\"#bib41\">Larsson et al., 2004</a>) and <i>Ir8a</i> or <i>Ir25a</i> for ionotropic receptors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Benton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abuin et al., 2011</a>). The <i>Ir8a</i> and <i>Ir25a</i> double mutant flies exhibited normal post-stimulus aggregation, showing that most ionotropic receptors are not required for the pheromone attraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Interestingly, in <i>orco</i> mutant flies, attraction behavior to the pheromone was completely abolished and instead repelled by the apple cider vinegar quadrant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This repulsion is likely due to acid sensing of minimal residual acetic acid on the quadrant mediated by the <i>Ir8a</i>/<i>Ir64a</i> complex (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ai et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, the <i>orco</i>, <i>Ir8a</i> double mutant was no longer repelled by the odor quadrant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and the use of neutralized apple cider vinegar as the stimulus eliminated the post-stimulus repulsion demonstrated by <i>orco</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We further tested if acidity of the apple cider vinegar was necessary for triggering wild-type post-stimulation behavior by neutralizing apple cider vinegar to pH = 7.0. No phenotypic difference was found compared to non-neutralized apple cider vinegar (pH = 3.2) (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In sum, these data suggest that detection of the food-odor-induced pheromone is mediated through the <i>orco</i>-dependent olfactory system."

We induced wild-type flies to deposit the food-odor induced pheromone onto the glass plate and dissolved the deposited molecules into hexane. We then painted the hexane extract onto a new glass plate in a letter \u2018E\u2019 pattern. Na\u00efve new flies were able to trace and follow the E pattern but do not follow control hexane extracts of flies stimulated by humidified air painted in the same pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A, B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). These experiments demonstrated that an active pheromone component(s) was successfully preserved during the pheromone extraction. Behavioral results suggested the pheromone was volatile because: 1) it required the olfactory system for detection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>); 2) constant air flushing reduced behavioral attraction after \u223c25 min (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>); and 3) heating the pheromone-containing arena to 32\u00b0C to increase odor volatility eliminated post-stimulus behaviors (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Recently, four cuticular hydrocarbons were identified as male-specific volatile pheromones: 7-docosene, 5-tricosene, 23-methyldocosane, and 9-tricosene (<a href=\"#bib24\">Farine et al., 2012</a>). To identify the nature of the pheromone(s), we performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) analyses of hexane extracts from quadrants stimulated with apple cider vinegar alone, with humidified air + flies, and with apple cider vinegar + flies. Consistent with behavioral results that cVA is unlikely to be the food-odor induced pheromone (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), cVA was not detected in pheromone extracts from the glass plates (<a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). 7-docosene and 23-methyldocosane were also not detected, while 5-tricosene was detected at trace amounts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The levels of 7-tricosene were increased in the experimental conditions. However, our behavioral results excluded 7-tricosene as the food-odor-induced pheromone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; also see below and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Interestingly, only one other peak was significantly enriched in the experimental but not humidified air + flies control group: (Z) 9-tricosene (9-T) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Little is known regarding the function of 9-tricosene in <i>D. melanogaster</i> besides its presence as a male-specific volatile pheromone (<a href=\"#bib22\">Everaerts et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Farine et al., 2012</a>). To determine if 9-tricosene was attractive to <i>Drosophila</i>, as would be predicted for the food-odor induced aggregation pheromone, we used 9-tricosene as the stimulus in the 4-field olfactory assay. Indeed, 9-tricosene elicits attraction behaviors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D-E</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). To determine if 9-tricosene could direct aggregation behaviors, we repeated the \u2018E\u2019 experiment using 9-tricosene alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Na\u00efve flies did trace and follow the 9-tricosene pattern, paying particular attention to the odor border (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Nonetheless, the aggregation response was not identical to the full hexane extract. In particular, flies appeared to be repelled by the center of a concentrated 9-tricosene odor trail. The sensory cause of this repulsion remains to be identified, but may arise from high concentrations of 9-tricosene mediating olfactory or gustatory contact repulsion. Such highly concentrated 9-tricosene deposits are unlikely to be found after food-odor-induced pheromone deposition in the four-field olfactory assay. Overall, these data suggest that 9-tricosene under certain conditions can function as an aggregation pheromone, although additional pheromone components may contribute to the full aggregation phenotype."

                                "text": "We next identified the <i>orco</i>-positive olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that respond to 9-tricosene, by using Fluorescence-guided Single Sensillum Recording (FgSSR) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lin and Potter, 2015</a>), which detects the activity of olfactory neurons within single sensory sensilla. Previously characterized volatile pheromones typically activate trichoid sensillar neurons (<a href=\"#bib62\">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007</a>), and kairomones (odorants released by other animals or plants) typically activate intermediate sensillar neurons (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stensmyr et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dweck et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ronderos et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dweck et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lin and Potter, 2015</a>). Surprisingly, 9-tricosene did not stimulate these sensillar neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We found that 9-tricosene elicits rapid and robust firing patterns in the antennal basiconic ab4 sensillum, which houses two neurons (ab4A and ab4B) that express Or7a (ab4A) or Or56a receptors (ab4B) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Couto et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Stensmyr et al., 2012</a>). 9-Tricosene stimulates spiking of the larger amplitude neuron indicating the 9-tricosene-responsive ORNs are ab4A, which express Or7a receptors. Stimulation of ab4 sensilla by flies housed in a glass vial pre-stimulated with apple cider vinegar, compared to flies pre-stimulated with dry air alone, also led to significant increases in ab4A (Or7a) activation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The identification of Or7a as a 9-tricosene pheromone receptor was surprising as, unlike previously identified pheromone receptors, it had been shown to respond to a broad range of odors, including many aldehydes and alcohols (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hallem et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>). To determine if the Or7a receptor is sufficient for 9-tricosene responses, we misexpressed Or7a in an olfactory neuron that lacks an odorant receptor in ab3A sensillar neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dobritsa et al., 2003</a>). Expression of Or7a endowed ab3A neurons the ability to respond to 9-tricosene comparable to the 9-tricosene activation pattern detected in endogenous Or7a-positive ab4 sensillum (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). These data indicate that the Or7a receptor responds to 9-tricosene. This is unexpected since basiconic sensilla were traditionally considered food odor detectors (<a href=\"#bib41\">Larsson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Suh et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jones et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Laissue and Vosshall, 2008</a>). Both male and female ab4A/Or7a neurons responded equally to 9-tricosene (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), consistent with 9-tricosene being attractive to both males and females (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>). Or7a neurons did not respond to cVA (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Ab4 sensilla in <i>Or7a</i> mutants were identified based on their shape and the specific response of the ab4B neuron to geosmin (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stensmyr et al., 2012</a>). No spontaneous or 9-tricosene stimulated ab4A spiking activity was observed in <i>Or7a</i> mutant flies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>), indicating that Or7a is necessary for 9-tricosene activation in ab4 sensilla.

We did not detect expression outside the antennae (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We thus could use the <i>Or7a-GAL4</i> line to specifically ablate Or7a<sup>+</sup> antennal neurons and test for changes in behavior. Aggregation responses to both the naturally deposited food-odor induced pheromone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>) and to 9-tricosene (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>) were completely abolished in Or7a neuron-ablated flies obtained using <i>Or7a-Gal4+UAS-hid</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) or <i>Or7a-Gal4+UAS-DTI</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Ablation of other odorant receptors (<i>OrX-Gal4+UAS-hid</i>) did not affect aggregation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Similarly, <i>Or7a</i> mutants completely lacked attraction to the naturally deposited food-odor-induced pheromone and to 9-tricosene (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B-E</a>). To verify that aggregation behavior is specific to 9-tricosene, we repeated the experiments using the 9-tricosene pheromone isomer 7-tricosene (7-T), which contains an identical carbon chain length to 9-tricosene but a double bond at an alternate location. Interestingly, 7-tricosene induced a neutral to slightly repulsive behavior in WT flies (AI = \u22120.07 \u00b1 0.026, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These data suggest that aggregation behavior to the naturally deposited food-odor-induced pheromone depends on 9-tricosene and proper function of the <i>Or7a</i> receptor."

Since 9-tricosene acts as a geographical marker for food, it could function as a male-generated guide for female egg-laying decisions. We modified our 4-field arena by spreading a thin layer of 1% agarose onto one of the glass plates to serve as a substrate for the deposited pheromone and an appropriate medium for female egg-laying (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). In order to rule out potentially confounding roles of males in this behavior, only previously mated females were assayed. Under conditions in which the food-odor-stimulated pheromone was deposited onto the agarose (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2032</a>), females laid five-fold more eggs in the pheromone quadrant. This suggests that a deposited pheromone could guide female egg-laying site selection decisions. We next generated an arena in which one quadrant contained 9-tricosene (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Female flies also laid significantly more eggs in locations containing only 9-tricosene (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>\u2032). The 9-tricosene egg-laying preference was abolished when Or7a neurons were ablated (<i>Or7a-Gal4/UAS-hid</i> or <i>Or7a-Gal4/UAS-DTI</i>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2032</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The 9-tricosene guided egg laying preference was also abolished in <i>Or7a</i> mutant flies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The oviposition preference for the 9-tricosene quadrant was not due to the innate attraction to 9-tricosene because females spent similar time in the four quadrants over the course of the 23 hr egg-laying assay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>)."

To verify that oviposition guidance is specific to 9-tricosene, we repeated the oviposition experiments using the 9-tricosene pheromone isomer 7-tricosene (7-T), the most abundant cuticular hydrocarbon in male flies (<a href=\"#bib22\">Everaerts et al., 2010</a>). Female flies did not preferentially oviposit in the 7-T quadrant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Interestingly, total egg numbers laid were significant higher in <i>Or7a</i> mutant and Or7a neuron ablated flies, implying a potential connection of oviposition site selection and egg deposition number (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). The female ovipositor can be involved in the detection and guidance to egg-laying cues (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yang et al., 2008</a>). However, since Or7a is expressed only in the antennae and not in the female ovipositor (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), this implicates Or7a signaling in the antennae as the main driver of Or7a-directed oviposition guidance. All together, these data suggest that male derived 9-tricosene can guide female egg-laying preferences, and this decision-making process requires proper antennal Or7a neuronal function."

The concentration of E2-hexenal at a foraging site will vary depending on the fruit source, the stage of ripening (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baldwin et al., 1991</a>), and the extent of fruit or leaf damage. Most undamaged plants emit undetectable levels of E2-hexenal (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hatanaka and Harada, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bate and Rothstein, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Farag and Pare, 2002q</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Myung et al., 2006</a>).

For instance, 9-tricosene is a sex attractant for female houseflies (<i>Musca domestica</i>) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Carlson et al., 1971</a>) and honey bee waggle dancers (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) use a pheromone cocktail that includes 9-tricosene to communicate with nest mates about the locations of food sources (<a href=\"#bib61\">Thom et al., 2007</a>).

Our data further suggests that activation of odorant receptors by both pheromone and plant volatiles might be more widespread than previously anticipated. Indeed, an olfactory receptor in the moth <i>Agrotis ipsilon</i> that was previously considered to be pheromone specific was recently found to also respond to the plant volatile heptanal, despite the plant volatile showing no structural similarity to the moth pheromone (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rouyar et al., 2015</a>)."

The behavior comprises three steps\u2014an ovipositor motor program, a clean/rest period and a search-like behavior. The ovipositor motor program that leads to egg deposition is relatively short (6\u20137 s) as compared to clean/rest and search-like behaviors (100\u2013130 s) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yang et al., 2008</a>). Rapid egg-laying associated with an extended positional search is consistent with our observations that over long time periods there were no detectable positional preferences in the 9-tricosene pheromone quadrant even though female flies preferentially laid eggs in this quadrant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). These findings also suggest that 9-tricosene might mediate two temporally distinct responses in our experimental design. A short-term aggregation behavior that lasts \u223c25 min and a long-term oviposition site selection behavior that lasts for hours.

Since 9-tricosene is enriched only upon food-odor stimulation, and acts to aggregate animals and increase courtship (Lin and Potter, unpublished observations), it could be a mechanism used by <i>Drosophila</i> males to increase the likelihood that their progeny will be laid in an optimal location. Thus, in addition to \u2018mother-knows-best\u2019, this suggest that \u2018father\u2019 may have co-opted a female\u2019s olfactory system in order to influence an egg-laying decision for maximizing progeny survival."

Our behavioral experiments suggest a strong positive correlation with the specificity of Or7a activation and oviposition-guidance. This suggests that activation of the Or7a olfactory receptor neuron can strongly influence egg-laying decisions. 9-Tricosense may therefore have a specific influence on oviposition decisions due to its specific activation of Or7a. Or7a olfactory neurons join a growing list of olfactory neurons found to mediate specific olfactory behaviors like oviposition-site selection (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dweck et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">2015b</a>), aversion (<a href=\"#bib58\">Suh et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Stensmyr et al., 2012</a>), courtship (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kurtovic et al., 2007</a>), and attraction (<a href=\"#bib54\">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</a>).

Might these disparate olfactory signals for oviposition decision converge in the female brain? ORNs expressing the same ORs converge onto the same glomeruli and synapse with second order projection neurons, which relay the olfactory information to higher brain regions (mushroom body calyx and lateral horn) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jefferis et al., 2007</a>). We demonstrate that basiconic Or7a neurons are responsible for 9-tricosene and E2-hexenal guided oviposition decisions (<a href=\"#fig6 fig7\">Figure 6C,D,7C,7D</a>). Recently, it was found that flies preferred citrus fruit as oviposition substrates as detected by Or19a + olfactory neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dweck et al., 2013</a>), and also preferred to oviposit on substrates containing ethylphenols as detected by Or71a + olfactory neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dweck et al., 2015b</a>). Interestingly, the Or7a DL5, Or19a DC1, and Or71a VC2 projection neurons share highly similar axonal projection patterns in the lateral horn that are distinct from previously described food and pheromone regions (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jefferis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ronderos et al., 2014</a>). This suggests that oviposition site-selection might be strongly guided by a dedicated olfactory processing brain center."

Central air passed through a carbon filter before being split into multiple channels each regulated by a high-resolution flowmeter (Cole\u2013Parmer). Electronically controlled 3-way solenoid valves (Automate Scientific, Berkeley, CA) regulated if clean air leaving the flowmeters expelled into the room or entered into custom made odor chambers (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lundstrom et al., 2010</a>). Teflon tubing was used for odor delivery. The Teflon fly arena is 19.5 cm by 19.5 cm, with a thickness of 0.7 cm. Glass plates were secured onto the arena using clamps. The airflow of each quadrant was maintained at a rate of 100 ml min<sup>\u22121</sup> and verified by an electronic flowmeter before each experiment. Apple cider vinegar was diluted in H<sub>2</sub>O to make the final concentrations of 6.25% (1/16), 1.56% (1/64) and 0.39% (1/256) and acetic acid in water to make final concentration of 0.33%. Ethyl acetate and 9-tricosene (Sigma #859885) were diluted in paraffin oil for final concentration of 0.001% and 0.1%. When paraffin oil was used as solvent in the odor chamber, paraffin oil alone used in the three non-odor control chambers. 40\u201350 flies with an isogenized genetic background (<i>IsoD1 w</i><sup><i>1118</i></sup>) were used. At the time of the assay, flies were 4\u20136 days old and had been starved in vials containing 1% agarose for 40-42 hr to increase locomotor activity. The dark arena was illuminated by 2 infrared LED arrays (AL4554-880; Advanced Illumination, Rochester, VT), monitored by an infrared camera (Sony XC-EI50), and flies tracked by previously described software (<a href=\"#bib37\">Katsov and Clandinin, 2008</a>). Data was analyzed by custom Matlab scripts. On average, each fly generates approximately 1800 tracked positional data points per min. If two flies intersect, their respective previously continuous tracks are considered completed, and new independent tracks begun once they move apart. This assures continuously labeled tracks originated from the same fly. An Attraction Index (AI) is defined as (Ot<sub>5</sub>-Cavgt<sub>5</sub>)/ (Ot<sub>5</sub>+Cavgt<sub>5</sub>), in which Ot<sub>5</sub> is the number of tracked positional data points in the odor quadrant and Cavgt<sub>5</sub> is average number of tracked positional data points in non-odor control quadrants over a 5 min testing period. An AI = 1 indicates all flies were tracked to the odor quadrant, and an AI = 0 indicates flies were equally distributed to all four quadrants."

One quadrant of the control gel or 9-tricosene or 7-tricosene gel was cut out and transferred to a Petri dish. In order to increase egg production, mixed population of male and female flies were pre-induced in vials with wet yeast paste (yeast +0.5% propionic acid) overnight. Mated females from premixed population were rapidly separated by cooling on ice and transferred to the arena gel. The egg laying behavior was performed in a dark enclosure at room temperature for 22\u201323 hr. Simultaneous recordings of the fly positions were performed using the same setup for tracking of the four-quadrant behavior assay described above except that the frame rate was set at 1 frame/5 s due to the large file size generated over the extended time period. On average, each fly generated approximately 16,560 tracked positions per experiment. The recorded data was analyzed with custom Matlab programs and analyzed for the AI as defined above.

This phenomenon is in itself novel and interesting. Previous work on aggregation and oviposition has focused on how females are attracted by other females (leading to oviposition in patches, which may provide the progeny an advantage as they can better cope with competition from fungi and other fly species). This work is the first of its kind to show that males can drive female aggregation."

In support of this, the authors demonstrate that the attractive factor can be extracted in hexane and they postulate that the main factor is 9-tricosene on the basis of a GC/MS analysis. They demonstrate then that 9-tricosene (9-T) is detected by sensilla expressing Or7a. Ablating neurons expressing Or7a suppresses the attraction induced by 9-T (delivered as an odorant) as well as oviposition induction. Finally, they compare the effects of 9-T and E2-hexenal since E2-hexenal also activates Or7a."

While 9-T seems to have an effect as an odorant, the nice \u201cE\u201d effect of the biological extract may need a contact chemical like 7-T or a chemical not detected through their chemical analysis."

These are different assays. Their \u201cE\u201d experiment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A, B</a>) is very nice.

Flies require feeding of all-trans-retinal (ATR) for optogenetic activation of channel rhodopsins, and so we compared the same genotype of flies that were, or were not, fed ATR. We found that activation of Or7a neurons could lead to a significant increase in egg-laying preference towards substrates illuminated by the stimulating red light. The significance of this experiment is reduced by a wide range of behaviors of the -ATR control flies to the red-light source, which might arise from experimental conditions outside our control. Nonetheless, these results do suggest that activation of Or7a neurons is sufficient to drive oviposition-site selection.

Pentanoic acid and hexyl butyrate were selected because they specifically activate Ors that benzaldehyde and 1-butanol also activate: Or67a and Or35a. We found that all Or7a ligands could, to differing degrees, induce positive egg-laying preferences. In contrast, all non-Or7a ligands showed neutral or negative egg-laying preferences. Interestingly, odorants that more selectively activated Or7a (e.g., 1-propanol) showed the greatest preference in egg-laying assays. These results suggest that activation of Or7a neurons can strongly influence positive egg-laying site preferences. 9-tricosene, as a selective activator of Or7a neurons, can thereby drive strong egg-laying preferences.

I would like to first emphasize that the \u201cE\u201d pattern is not the primary olfactory aggregation assay we used for our aggregation experiments. The main aggregation phenotype, in which all olfactory assays were conducted, is in the 4-field arena. In the 4-field assay, we did utilize 'taste' mutants to determine the role of these mutants in aggregation to the full pheromone(s) deposited by the flies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), as well as to 9-tricosene (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). These experiments showed that taste was not required for aggregation to the pheromone. The \u201cE\u201d trail assay was used mainly to verify that our hexane extracts contained functional aggregation molecules as inputs for GC-MS analyses. As such, pipetting 9-tricosene directly onto the arena in such a fashion may not closely mimic the aggregation 4-field assay in which 9-tricosene is deposited over a large surface area. Furthermore, additional focus on the \u201cE\u201d experiments may distract readers from the major findings of the study which demonstrate that an apple-cider vinegar odor-induced pheromone affects female oviposition decisions via Or7a receptors. For these reasons, we are hesitant to continue with technically challenging and extensive experiments on the 9-tricosene \u201cE\u201d pattern, preferring to instead explore these questions more rigorously and extensively in a separate study. At this point, we prefer to modify the text to address these concerns, and raise the possibility that 9-tricosene might mediate olfactory or gustatory avoidance at high concentrations."

In addition, our summary introductory paragraph now emphasizes that Or7a was previously found to be a generalist, in contrast to previously identified pheromone receptors."
