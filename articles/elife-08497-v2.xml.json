Here, we applied a <i>Drosophila</i> model to follow in vivo behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMPs), the transient fruit fly muscle stem cells. We report that emerging AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles. AMPs keep their filopodia-based association with muscles throughout their dormant state but also when they start to proliferate, suggesting that muscles could play a role in AMP reactivation. Indeed, our genetic analyses indicate that muscles send inductive dIlp6 signals that switch the Insulin pathway ON in closely associated AMPs. This leads to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. Altogether, we report that <i>Drosophila</i> AMPs display homing behavior to muscle niche and that the niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs."

Here, we applied a <i>Drosophila</i> model to follow in vivo behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMPs), the transient fruit fly muscle stem cells. We report that emerging AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles. AMPs keep their filopodia-based association with muscles throughout their dormant state but also when they start to proliferate, suggesting that muscles could play a role in AMP reactivation. Indeed, our genetic analyses indicate that muscles send inductive dIlp6 signals that switch the Insulin pathway ON in closely associated AMPs. This leads to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. Altogether, we report that <i>Drosophila</i> AMPs display homing behavior to muscle niche and that the niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs."

These cells are produced by stem cells, which often reside in a special microenvironment called the stem cell niche. This niche may also contain support cells that produce signals to attract stem cells and then maintain them in a dormant state. When the muscle is damaged, its resident stem cells are activated so that they divide to produce new cells. Understanding how this happens is an important goal for regenerative medicine, but many of the details remain unclear."

Insulin signalling \u2013 which is sensitive to the availability of nutrients in the body \u2013 turns on another signalling pathway, called Notch, that then stimulate the AMPs to divide. Aradhya, Zmojdzian et al. propose that this signalling cascade might help to ensure that AMPs are only activated at the right time in development. The next step is to find out whether stem cells in human muscles are activated in a similar way."

                        "text": "Stem cells exhibit a remarkable capacity to keep a quiescent undifferentiated state, and then, once activated, contribute to developmental growth or damage tissue regeneration. Over the years, lineage tracing and serial transplantation assays have confirmed the presence of stem cell populations in many tissues in both invertebrate and vertebrate organisms (for reviews, see [<a href=\"#bib53\">Voog and Jones, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Simons and Clevers, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jiang and Edgar, 2012</a>]). These populations include multipotent cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) which can give rise to a broad range of cell types (<a href=\"#bib32\">Marquez-Curtis et al., 2011</a>), and committed precursors, such as the satellite cells required for postnatal growth and the repair of a specific tissue, i.e. skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buckingham and Montarras, 2008</a>). Importantly, stem cell activity and capacity to maintain tissue homeostasis depend on a specialized microenvironment called the niche. The stem cell niche was first documented in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib56\">Xie and Spradling, 2000</a>) but it is now widely accepted that all adult stem cells reside within a niche that retains them and regulates their behavior (<a href=\"#bib53\">Voog and Jones, 2010</a>). Niches range in size and complexity (<a href=\"#bib36\">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</a>). They may house a single stem cell, like the follicle stem cell (FSC) niche (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nystul and Spradling, 2007</a>), or more than 10 germ stem cells (GSCs), like the testis niche (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wallenfang et al., 2006</a>). Niches may also occupy a single spatially invariant location throughout adult life (e.g. the GSC niche in <i>Drosophila</i>), or instead form a complex system of multiple niches distributed throughout tissues (e.g. HSC niches) (for a review, see <a href=\"#bib36\">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</a>). Like HSCs, which are able to reside in alternative niches, muscle stem cells (satellite cells) are scattered under the basal laminae of myofibers, which host them and contribute to their niche (<a href=\"#bib13\">Collins et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kuang et al., 2007</a>). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control niche occupancy by stem cells remain poorly understood. Recent work on myogenic progenitor cells, which ensure developmental muscle growth but also provide a source of cells that adopt satellite cell position, has shed new light on this issue (<a href=\"#bib9\">Br\u00f6hl et al., 2012</a>). It has been shown that Notch signaling is required for the homing of emerging satellite cells by stimulating them to produce basal lamina, thus promoting their adhesion to myofibers (<a href=\"#bib9\">Br\u00f6hl et al., 2012</a>). Crucially, if the homing process is impaired, satellite cells are unable to receive inductive signals and thus efficiently contribute to muscle growth and regeneration. This makes gaining further insight into the homing of stem cells and their responsiveness to the signals emanating from the niche a key challenge."

                        "text": "We have previously characterized the <i>Drosophila</i> muscle stem cells called adult muscle precursors (AMPs) that emerge during mid-embryogenesis and express muscle progenitor-specific markers such as the b-HLH transcription factor Twist (<a href=\"#bib15\">Figeac et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2010</a>). The AMPs lie dormant during embryonic and most of larval life but once activated they will proliferate to provide a source of myoblasts that ensure adult muscle growth and the regeneration of a subset of thoracic flight muscles. We also followed AMP cells in vivo using membrane-targeted GFP, and found that AMPs send out long cellular processes, and are interconnected (<a href=\"#bib16\">Figeac et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, the capacity to send out cytoplasmic extensions and make interconnections has also been documented for quiescent satellite cells sited on myofibers (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tavi et al., 2010</a>). All these features make AMPs similar to vertebrate satellite cells, prompting us to analyze their homing behavior and the mechanisms that drive their activation and exit from the dormant state."

We provide genetic evidence that muscles act via dIlp6 to switch the insulin pathway ON in AMPs and initiate AMP reactivation. This leads to a Deltex-involving activation of Notch, which positively regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc."

We showed in earlier work that soon after their specification, embryonic AMPs form an interconnected network via long cytoplasmic extensions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Figeac et al., 2010</a>). A similar feature has also been reported for the quiescent vertebrate satellite cells, which are connected to each other and to the adjacent muscle through thin cytoplasmic extensions termed \u2018tunneling nanotubes\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tavi et al., 2010</a>). To examine the dynamics of AMP cell morphology and behavior in more detail, we generated an AMP sensor line, m6-gapGFP (see Materials and methods) that enabled us to visualize the shapes of AMPs in vivo. We focused our analyses on the abdominal AMPs, which when quiescent form a repeat pattern of six cells per hemisegment (<a href=\"#bib16\">Figeac et al., 2010</a>). Initially, at embryonic stage 12, AMPs appear spherical in shape and are separated from each other (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), but a closer view (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) shows that they send out numerous thin filopodia around their surface. This 'sensing behavior' also persists in later embryonic stages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), in which AMPs become more elongated and send out long cytoplasmic extensions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) to form an interconnected network (<a href=\"#bib16\">Figeac et al., 2010</a>). The long cellular processes follow the main neural branches of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C'</a>, arrows), while the short filopodia display dynamic and irregular patterns and seem not to be attracted by the PNS nerves (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C'</a>, arrowheads)."

We found that the interconnecting cellular processes are present in first-instar larval AMPs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) but are then progressively lost, becoming undetectable in second instar larvae (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). However, the filopodia- and cell body-based contacts of AMPs with neighboring muscles persist along larval life until AMP reactivation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Compared with the late embryonic stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), quiescent AMPs at early second larval instar (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) project relatively few filopodia. As shown for lateral AMPs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), they adopt highly elongated shapes with two long cellular protrusions that extend and follow growing muscle. At this stage, the lateral AMPs restrict their contact to the two closest muscle neighbors, i.e. SBM and LO1, illustrating preferential interactions with these two muscles already seen in embryos."

Conversely, we found higher numbers of AMPs following the overexpression of InRCA, a constitutively activated form of the Insulin receptor, or Rheb, the positive modulator of the TOR pathway (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>).

This suggests that the Notch pathway is activated in embryonic AMPs, but the question of whether it plays a role in setting quiescent versus proliferative AMP state remained unsolved. Here, we showed that m6-Gal4-targeted expression of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in embryonic AMPs does not alter their quiescence in embryos (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, in the same NICD context, there were significantly higher numbers of AMPs in third-instar larvae, suggesting that Notch reactivates AMPs in larval stages and promotes their proliferation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>).

As the decrease in AMP numbers in a Notch-RNAi context has not been associated with a reduced level of GFP driven by the same m6 regulatory element (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we hypothesize that a low Notch level is sufficient to maintain m6 activity but we cannot rule out a possibility that perdurance of Gal4 and GFP in larval stages plays role as well."

                                "text": "We then tested whether the Insulin pathway acted upstream of Notch and dMyc. First, we quantified the level of Notch and dMyc in the individual lateral AMPs, and found that the mean fluorescent intensity representing Notch and dMyc protein levels was increased in the InRCA context (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,C\",J,K</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>) compared with wild-type (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,B'',J,K</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>) and was significantly lower in the AMPs expressing the negative regulator of Insulin signaling PTEN (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J,K</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). The Insulin pathway thus positively regulates Notch and dMyc during AMP reactivation. Next, using the same approach, we tested dMyc protein levels in AMP-targeted gain and loss of Notch function, and found that Notch increased nuclear dMyc levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,D''</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>), suggesting that Notch acts upstream of dMyc. The sum of these observations prompted us to determine whether dMyc acted as an effector of Insulin and Notch pathways, and whether Notch functioned downstream of Insulin during AMP proliferation. We found that lowering Notch or dMyc levels in AMPs expressing InRCA led to an attenuation of the AMP overproliferation phenotype, indicating that both Notch and dMyc act downstream of the Insulin pathway (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013G,L, M</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). We also observed that the increased number of AMPs generated in the NICD-overexpressing context was dMyc-dependent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I,L, M</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>), indicating that dMyc acts as an effector of Notch in reactivated AMPs. Taken together, these data establish an Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade governing the exit of AMPs from the dormant state and promoting their proliferation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5M</a>). However, as NICD overexpression induces higher numbers of AMPs than InRCA overexpression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>), we cannot rule out the possibility that Notch also acts in an InR-independent way."

                                "text": "The increased levels of intracellular Notch in AMPs expressing the activated form of Insulin receptor (InRCA) suggested that Insulin promotes Notch pathway activity during AMP reactivation. A similar observation was recently reported in <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal stem cells in which proliferation and differentiation is finely tuned by the interplay between the Insulin and Notch pathways (<a href=\"#bib17\">Foronda et al., 2014</a>). However, the issue of whether the Insulin-dependent regulation of Notch involves conventional Delta/Serrate signal transduction has never been addressed. We thus tested whether the attenuation of Delta or Serrate in the muscle or PNS cells with which AMPs are associated impacts on AMP proliferation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). We found that knocking down Notch ligands in direct AMP cell neighbors has no effect on AMP reactivation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). Similarly, expressing in AMPs a dominant-negative form of Notch receptor (ECN) devoid of intracellular domain and known to efficiently repress canonical Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rebay et al., 1993</a>) had no effect on AMP cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>), suggesting that Notch activation in AMPs could occur in a ligand-independent way. To further explore the Insulin-Notch pathway linkage, we tested the expression of the ubiquitin ligase Deltex, which is known to play a role in ligand-independent intracellular activation of Notch by promoting its mono-ubiquitinated state (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hori et al., 2011</a>). We found that punctate cytoplasmic Deltex expression increased significantly in AMPs expressing InRCA compared to the control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). Consistently with this observation, targeted expression of Deltex in AMPs or attenuation of its repressor Supressor of Deltex (Su (Dx)) both led to an overproliferation phenotype (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E,I</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). <a href=\"#bib22\">Hori et al. (2011)</a> proposed that non-visual \u03b2-arrestin homolog Kurtz (Krz) binds together with Deltex to the Notch receptor, leading to its poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. We tested Krz function in AMPs and found that both increasing and decreasing Kurtz levels leads to overproliferation of AMPs (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). This suggested that the stoichiometry of Krz and Dx levels regulates Notch activation in AMPs (see schemes in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Indeed, reducing Deltex by RNAi-based attenuation or by overexpressing Su (Dx) led to an increased number of AMPs (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6-source data 1</a>) similar to that observed in the Deltex overexpression context (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,I</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>), whereas simultaneous overexpression of Deltex and Kurtz had no effect on AMP numbers (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). It has also been reported that Shrub, a component of the ESCRT-III complex that promotes Notch degradation in multivesicular bodies (MVBs), acts as a negative regulator of ligand-independent Notch activity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hori et al., 2011</a>). We thus tested whether Shrub attenuation could promote AMP proliferation. We found that a downregulation of Shrub in AMP cells results in a burst of AMP proliferation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,I</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). Consistent with all\u00a0these data, overexpressing Deltex or Kurtz in InRCA context increased AMP cell numbers compared to InRCA alone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). On the other hand, overexpressing Deltex in AMPs in which the Insulin pathway was attenuated by PTEN restored AMP proliferation back up to wild-type levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H,I</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). Taken together, this body of evidence suggests that during AMP reactivation, the Insulin pathway activates Notch in a Deltex and Shrub-involving ligand-independent way."

                                "text": "The specific role of the Insulin pathway in the proliferation of AMPs suggested it was induced by locally-secreted Insulin receptor ligands, the Insulin-like peptides (dIlps). We first tested mutants for <i>dIlp2, dIlp5</i> and <i>dIlp6</i> (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gr\u00f6nke et al., 2010</a>) and found that AMP proliferation was only inhibited in a <i>dIlp6</i> loss-of-function background (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). To identify the source of the dIlp6, we expressed a dominant-negative (DN) form of <i>Drosophila</i> dynamin protein called Shibire (Shi-DN) in larval muscles, neural cells and glial cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013F,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). Shi-DN affects vesicular trafficking and thus inhibits the secretion of signaling molecules from the cell (<a href=\"#bib48\">Seugnet et al., 1997</a>). We found that blocking the secretion from larval muscles affected the proliferation of AMPs and reduced their numbers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>), whereas no effect was observed when Shi-DN was expressed in either neural cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>) or glial cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). A key role of muscles in producing dIlp6 and inducing AMP proliferation is further supported by the reduction of AMP numbers in larvae with attenuated <i>dIlp6</i> expression in muscles but not in glial cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,I,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). Conversely, an increased number of AMPs was detected in muscle-specific overexpression of dIlp6 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). To understand the link between persisting cellular extensions and reactivation of AMPs, we attempted to modulate filopodia formation by attenuating the <i>DAAM</i> gene encoding one of formins known to be involved in filopodia dynamics at axon growth cones (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gon\u00e7alves-Pimentel et al., 2011</a>). We found that <i>DAAM</i>-attenuation leads to an altered AMP proliferation in third-instar larvae (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7M</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>) that correlates with reduced length of cellular protrusions observed in <i>DAAM</i>-RNAi second-instar larvae (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7L</a>, compare to wild-type shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K</a>)."

Niche properties, particularly of its muscle component, also appear crucial for the regenerative potential of satellite cells during aging (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</a>) and satellite cell engraftment in cell therapy approaches (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boldrin et al., 2012</a>)."

Here, we monitored the morphology of embryonic AMPs using a m6-gapGFP sensor line and found that in addition to the long cytoplasmic extensions that connect AMPs together (<a href=\"#bib16\">Figeac et al., 2010</a>), they also send out numerous thin filopodia and display homing behavior to a set of surrounding muscles. The newly\u00a0specified AMPs initially display spherical shapes with short thin filopodia distributed around their surface, but shortly afterwards they start to send filopodia in a more directional way, become more elongated extending along the neighboring muscles and connecting them via stabilized cellular protrusions. Thus, the dormant AMPs, like vertebrate satellite cells, adapt their shapes to muscle niche and became tightly associated with muscle fibers, an assumption supported by dotty integrin expression associated with both AMP cell bodies and their muscle-connecting filopodia. Interestingly, the quiescent satellite cells also have the capacity to produce cellular extensions, called nanotubes, connecting muscle stem cells to the muscle fiber (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tavi et al., 2010</a>), which further argues that AMPs and satellite cells display similar behavior. How the homing of satellite cells and AMPs is regulated remains to be explored, but the Notch pathway, which is activated in AMPs and required to produce basal lamina by adhering to muscle satellite cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Br\u00f6hl et al., 2012</a>), appears to play a central role. It is also unknown how satellite cells behave during their reactivation, how they adapt their shapes, and when they lose nanotube connections to muscle niche. Using membrane-targeted GFP enabled us to follow the behavior of AMPs and, for the first time, to visualize them at the time they are reactivated from the dormant state. Our data reveal that the AMPs maintain their elongated shapes with filopodia extending along the muscle niche during the first events of proliferation, which supports the view that muscles play an instructive role during AMP reactivation."

It has previously been shown that the Insulin/TOR signaling pathway controls the exit of <i>Drosophila</i> neural stem cells from their dormant state (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chell and Brand, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</a>). Global gene expression profiling also revealed that Insulin Growth Factor (IGF) signaling components are upregulated in activated satellite cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pallafacchina et al., 2010</a>). We therefore tested whether the Insulin pathway could reactivate <i>Drosophila</i> AMPs. We found that Insulin and TOR signaling components effectively promote the exit of AMPs from their dormant state, while also positively regulating AMP proliferation. However, increased Insulin/TOR signaling alone is not sufficient to end AMP quiescence during embryonic stages, suggesting a more complex regulatory cascade for the control of AMP reactivation. It has been demonstrated that the reactivation of dormant neuroblasts is driven by a nutritional checkpoint during the second larval instar (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chell and Brand, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</a>). Given that AMPs also remain quiescent in nutrient deprivation settings, we hypothesize that a nutrient-dependent switch in metabolism may contribute to AMP reactivation, and might thus be responsible for the inability of embryonic AMPs to enter proliferation. Quiescent stem cells have few mitochondria and use anaerobic metabolism, whereas activated cells switch their metabolism to a high ATP energy output aerobic glycolysis in order to support the high-level macromolecular synthesis required for proliferation, (<a href=\"#bib34\">Montarras et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, genes encoding glycolytic and pyruvate metabolic enzymes known to be downstream of Insulin (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tixier et al., 2013</a>) act as upstream regulators of the Notch pathway (<a href=\"#bib47\">Saj et al., 2010</a>), providing a potential link between metabolism and Notch in regulating the quiescent versus activated state of stem cells. A well-known feature of quiescent non-differentiated cells is that they keep Notch activated (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bjornson et al., 2012</a>), but Notch receptor activation can also trigger proliferation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baonza and Garcia-Bellido, 2000</a>), including the proliferation of satellite cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Qin et al., 2013</a>). Here, we followed the GFP expression driven by a Notch-responsive element of the <i>m6</i> gene and found that dormant AMPs are GFP-positive, which suggests that, like in satellite cells, Notch is involved in setting the AMP quiescent state. On the other hand, we also observed that during larval stages Notch promotes AMP proliferation, indicating that Notch might play a dual role, again like in satellite cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Qin et al., 2013</a>). Notch acting in concert with Numb is also known to control asymmetric divisions of adult satellite cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kuang et al., 2007</a>). However, in <i>Drosophila</i>, Numb has no impact on AMP proliferation, indicating a novel role for Notch in promoting symmetric cell divisions of AMPs. As Notch regulates the proliferation of cancer cells via Myc (<a href=\"#bib41\">Palomero et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Weng et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Liao et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ishikawa et al., 2013</a>), and Myc promotes the proliferation of myoblasts during development and regeneration (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2012</a>), we tested whether dMyc was involved in AMP reactivation in <i>Drosophila</i>. Our data show that dMyc is indeed required for AMP reactivation and proliferation. Genetic rescue experiments show that Notch acts downstream of the Insulin pathway and dMyc functions downstream of Notch. Interestingly, it has been shown that coordinated activation of Insulin and Notch pathways also regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of intestinal <i>Drosophila</i> stem cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Foronda et al., 2014</a>). Here, our data suggest that Notch pathway activation downstream of Insulin involves Deltex and is likely ligand-independent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The role of ligand-independent Notch activation, which involves interaction with Hif-\u03b1, has been reported as essential for normal <i>Drosophila</i> blood cell development (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mukherjee et al., 2011</a>). Our findings further highlight the biological importance of non-canonical Notch activation and provide early evidence for its role during stem cell-niche interactions."

These claims are rather contradictory. Most likely there is a simple explanation (perdurance of Gal4 and GFP in the latter?) but this does make the results confusing for the reader (e.g. subheading \u201cNotch acts downstream of the Insulin pathway and regulates the proliferation of AMPs via dMyc\u201d and in the Discussion: \"Here we followed the GFP expression driven by a Notch-responsive element of the <i>m6</i> gene and found that the Notch pathway was active in dormant AMPs\"). Can they be confident that this is reading out Notch activity at that time? Maybe the enhancer requires Notch for activation but not for maintenance?

But at the same time they place quite a strong emphasis on the role of Deltex despite the fact that the results in this section are confusing and contradictory (e.g. over-expressing and attenuating Deltex have the same effects, likewise Su(dx), likewise kurtz). Given these contrary data, it doesn't seem appropriate to make major conclusions about the roles of these factors so I suggest that they remove the scheme from the right hand part of <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and further moderate their statements about the role of Dx. Altering Deltex activity does influence the AMPS but it is not clear that it is the main effector of the signaling through InR nor the critical regulator of Notch in this context."

The authors discuss in the rebuttal their experiment with the KuzDN, which gives minor effects that they argue should be ignored. But at the same time they place quite a strong emphasis on the role of Deltex despite the fact that the results in this section are confusing and contradictory (e.g. over-expressing and attenuating Deltex have the same effects, likewise Su(dx), likewise kurtz). Given these contrary data, it doesn't seem appropriate to make major conclusions about the roles of these factors so I suggest that they remove the scheme from the right hand part of <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and further moderate their statements about the role of Dx. Altering Deltex activity does influence the AMPS but it is not clear that it is the main effector of the signaling through InR nor the critical regulator of Notch in this context.</i> "
