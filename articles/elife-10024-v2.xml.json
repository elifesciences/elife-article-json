Here we present an NIR-stimulable optogenetic platform (termed 'Opto-CRAC') that selectively and remotely controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive gene expression to regulate the function of non-excitable cells, including T lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. When coupled to upconversion nanoparticles, the optogenetic operation window is shifted from the visible range to NIR wavelengths to enable wireless photoactivation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling and optogenetic modulation of immunoinflammatory responses. In a mouse model of melanoma by using ovalbumin as surrogate tumor antigen, Opto-CRAC has been shown to act as a genetically-encoded 'photoactivatable adjuvant' to improve antigen-specific immune responses to specifically destruct tumor cells. Our study represents a solid step forward towards the goal of achieving remote and wireless control of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-modulated activities with tailored function."

Here we present an NIR-stimulable optogenetic platform (termed 'Opto-CRAC') that selectively and remotely controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive gene expression to regulate the function of non-excitable cells, including T lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. When coupled to upconversion nanoparticles, the optogenetic operation window is shifted from the visible range to NIR wavelengths to enable wireless photoactivation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling and optogenetic modulation of immunoinflammatory responses. In a mouse model of melanoma by using ovalbumin as surrogate tumor antigen, Opto-CRAC has been shown to act as a genetically-encoded 'photoactivatable adjuvant' to improve antigen-specific immune responses to specifically destruct tumor cells. Our study represents a solid step forward towards the goal of achieving remote and wireless control of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-modulated activities with tailored function."

The action of immune cells can be tuned by controlling the flow of calcium ions through gate-like proteins in their membranes. He, Zhang et al. genetically engineered immune cells so that a calcium gate-controlling protein became light sensitive. When the cells were exposed to a blue light the calcium ion gates opened. When the light was turned off, the gates closed. More intense light caused more calcium to enter into the cells. Further experiments then revealed that exposing these engineered immune cells to blue light in the laboratory could trigger an immune response."

So, He, Zhang et al. used specific nanoparticles that have been shown to help transmit light deep within tissue. In these experiments, mice were injected with the light-sensitive immune cells and the nanoparticles. Then, a near-infrared laser beam that can transmit into the tissues was pointed at the mice. This caused calcium channels to open in the engineered cells deep in the mice. Finally, further experiments were used to show that this light-based stimulation could boost an immune response to aid the killing of cancer cells. Other scientists will likely use the technique to help them study immune, heart, and other types of cells that use calcium to communicate."

The application of channelrhodopsin (ChR)-based optogenetic tools is limited by the lack of ion selectivity and the inability to extend the spectral sensitivity into the near-infrared (NIR) range (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fenno et al., 2011</a>). Here we present a tissue penetrable near infrared-stimulable optogenetic platform (termed 'Opto-CRAC') that can be used to reversibly photo-manipulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through one of the most Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective ion channels, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channel, which is abundantly present in most non-excitable cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hogan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</a>). Our tool is based on the engineering of light sensitivity into the CRAC channel and its subsequent coupling to lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP), the latter of which act as nanotransducers to convert tissue penetrable NIR light into visible light emission (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). We demonstrate that Opto-CRAC tools can be applied to remotely control Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and generate repetitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, photo-tune Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gene expression, and modulate a myriad of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activities in cells of the immune system, including effector T cell activation, macrophage-mediated inflammasome activation, dendritic cells (DC) maturation and antigen presentation. Our study set the stage for achieving the goal of remote optogenetic immunomodulation and spatiotemporal control over cellular immunotherapy in a wireless manner."

                        "text": "Following antigen presentation, T cell receptor (TCR) engagement triggers a cascade of signaling events in T lymphocytes that elicit the influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the CRAC channel, a classic example of store operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hogan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</a>). The molecular choreography of SOCE is mainly coordinated by two proteins that are located in distinct cellular compartments: (i) ORAI1, a four-pass transmembrane protein that constitutes the CRAC channel pore-forming subunit in the plasma membrane (PM); and (ii) the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), an ER-resident Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor protein that is responsible for sensing ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion and directly gating ORAI1 channels through its cytosolic domain (STIM1-CT). Store depletion induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through CRAC channels further activates calcineurin, a downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphatase that dephosphorylates the master transcriptional regulator NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and subsequently causes NFAT nuclear translocation (<a href=\"#bib31\">M\u00fcller and Rao, 2010</a>). In the presence of the co-stimulatory pathway, which activates the activator protein 1 (AP-1), NFAT cooperates with AP-1 to turn on genes (<i>e.g.</i>, IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3) that are characteristic of a productive immune response (<a href=\"#bib31\">M\u00fcller and Rao, 2010</a>). To enable light control over the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/NFAT pathway, we set out to install light sensitivity into STIM1 by fusing a handful of STIM1-CT fragments with the genetically-encoded photoswitch LOV2 (light, oxygen, voltage) domain (residues 404\u2013546) of <i>Avena sativa</i> phototropin 1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Christie et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Harper, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Yao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wu et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When expressed alone, these STIM1-CT fragments are capable of eliciting varying degrees of constitutive activation of ORAI1 channels to mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry from the extracellular space to the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yuan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Park et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhou et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Soboloff et al., 2012</a>). In the dark, the C-terminal J\u03b1 helix docks to the LOV2 domain (<a href=\"#bib15\">Harper, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Yao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wu et al., 2009</a>) and keeps the ORAI1-activating STIM1-CT fragments quiescent. Upon blue light illumination, photoexcitation generates a covalent adduct between LOV2 residue C450 and the cofactor FMN (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>), thereby promoting the undocking and unwinding of the J\u03b1 helix to expose the STIM1-CT fragments. Unleashed STIM1-CT fragments further move toward the plasma membrane to directly engage and activate ORAI1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a,b</a>)."

In the dark, STIM1-CT fragments are kept inactive presumably by docking toward the LOV2 domain. Upon blue light illumination, the undocking and unfolding of the LOV2 C-terminal J\u03b1 helix lead to the exposure of the STIM1-CT fragments, enabling their interaction with ORAI1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx across the plasma membrane.

Residues KL or KLAAA was added between LOV2 and STIM1-CT fragments as linker. Five mutations were individually introduced into LOV2 domain. The chimera LOV2<sub>404-546</sub>-KL-STIM1<sub>336-486</sub> (designated as LOVSoc) exhibited the highest dynamic range without showing significant dark activity (judging from constitutive NFAT translocation in the dark). C450A traps the LOV2 domain in the dark state to acts as a negative control whilst I539E is known to keep LOV2 in its lit state (10). G528A, I532E and N538E have been reported to increase the dynamic range of LOV2 domain (58). However, those mutations did not seem to improve the overall performance of Opto-CRAC constructs in our hands. The previously reported LOVS1K (LOV2-STIM1<sub>233-450</sub>) (47), which is approximately 8 kDa larger than LOVSoc in size because of the inclusion of CC1 region, had a much narrower dynamic range with noticeable dark activity. The dark activity is gauged by the percentage of nuclear/total GFP-NFAT in the dark and defined as follows: \u201c\u2212\u201d, no discernible activation; \u201c+\u201d, less than 10% activation; \u201c++\u201d, \u2265 10%.

                        "text": "We first created a series of Opto-CRAC constructs by varying the length of STIM1-CT fragments, introducing mutations into the LOV2 domain and optimizing the linker between these two moieties (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). After an initial screen of approximately 100 constructs using NFAT nuclear translocation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx as readouts, we decided to use the LOV2-STIM1<sub>336-486</sub> chimera (designated as 'LOVSoc') in our following experiments because it showed no discernible dark activity and exhibited the highest dynamic range in terms of evoking light-inducible Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>). When expressed as an mCherry-tagged fusion protein in HEK293-ORAI1 stable cells, LOVSoc underwent rapid translocation between the cytosol and the PM in response to blue light illumination (t<sub>1/2,on</sub> = 6.8 \u00b1 2.3\u2009s; t<sub>1/2,off</sub> = 28.7 \u00b1 6.5\u2009s; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This process could be readily reversed by switching the light off, and could be repeated multiple times without significant loss in the magnitude of response. The light-dependent association between LOVSoc and ORAI1 or ORAI1 C-terminus (ORAI1-CT) was further confirmed by a pulldown assay using purified recombinant proteins and by coimmunoprecipitation assays (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In mammalian cells expressing LOVSoc, the degree of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx could be tuned by varying the light power densities (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>). After photostimulation for 1\u2009min with a power density of 40 \u03bcW/mm<sup>2</sup> at 470 nm, LOVSoc triggered significant yet varied elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations to approximately 500\u2013800 nM in a dozen of mammalian cell types derived from various non-excitable tissues (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3b</a>), likely owing to the varied endogenous levels of ORAI proteins among the tested cells. A Light-triggered global Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and oscillations in HeLa or HEK293T cells expressing mCherry-LOVSoc could be monitored in real-time by either Fura-2 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3c</a>) or genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs), including GCaMP6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2,3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chen et al., 2013</a>), R-CaMP2 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3d</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Inoue et al., 2015</a>), and R-GECO1.2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3e</a>) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). Notably, localized light stimulation can be applied to achieve local activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at a defined spatial resolution (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), thereby providing a new approach to dissect the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains in various biological processes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Parekh, 2008</a>). Depending on the kinetic properties of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators used, the half-life time of the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in response to light stimulation ranged from 23\u2009s to 36\u2009s. After switching off the light, the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal decayed with a half-life time of approximately 25\u201335\u2009s (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3f</a>). These values are largely in agreement with the time scale of SOCE under physiological stimulation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hogan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Soboloff et al., 2012</a>). We further measured the photo-activated currents by whole-cell recording in HEK293 cells stably expressing ORAI1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>). Following light stimulation, HEK293 cell transfected with LOVSoc developed a typical inward rectifying current, which is characteristic of the CRAC channel and distinct from the greater outward currents of non-selective cation channels such as TRPC (<a href=\"#bib38\">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</a>). Substitution of the most abundant extracellular cation Na<sup>+</sup> by a non-permeant ion NMDG<sup>+</sup> did not alter the amplitude or overall shape of the CRAC current, implying that Na<sup>+</sup> has negligible contribution to LOVSoc- mediated photoactivatable Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective CRAC currents."

We used either an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-based bicistronic vector or a self-cleaving 2A peptide strategy (<a href=\"#bib7\">de Felipe et al., 2006</a>) to enable the coexpression of ORAI1 and LOVSoc in the same cell with a single vector.

We applied a fixed light pulse of 30\u2009s while varying the interpulse intervals from 0.5 to 4\u2009min to generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation patterns with defined temporal resolution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) and compared the levels of NFAT activation in HeLa cells. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a> prolonged interpulse interval was largely accompanied by a decrease in the nuclear accumulation of NFAT. This observation agrees well with previous reports showing that higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation frequencies, or faster repetitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses, tend to increase the ability to activate NFAT (<a href=\"#bib8\">Lewis et al., 1998</a>). Thus, we have demonstrated that the engineered Opto-CRAC tools are able to achieve remote and photo-tunable activation of NFAT in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). We further confirmed the NFAT-dependent gene expression in HeLa cells transfected with an NFAT-driven luciferase (NFAT-Luc) reporter construct. In the presence of the co-stimulatory pathway (mimicked by the addition of the pleiotropic PKC activator PMA), light illumination led to a robust increase in luciferase gene expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). A decrease in the light pulse frequency also caused a reduction in the efficiency of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/NFAT-driven luciferase expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>). To obviate the use of carcinogenic PMA to photo-trigger gene expression, we also introduced a synthetic 5\u2019 transcription regulatory region upstream of gene <i>Ins1</i> (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stanley et al., 2012</a>), which contains a furin cleavage site that allows insulin processing in non-beta cells such as HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shifrin et al., 2001</a>). The 5\u2019 region is composed of three Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive elements in <i>cis</i>, including 2\u20133 copies of serum response elements (SRE), cAMP response elements (CRE) and NFAT response elements with a minimal promoter. Upon light stimulation, we observed a robust production of insulin in cells transfected with LOVSoc, but not in those without LOVSoc expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>)."

By contrast, control cells transduced with the mock retrovirus failed to exhibit light-dependent production of cytokines (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition to its well-established role in driving effector T cell activation, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> immobilization in macrophage is critical for the activation of the NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-repeat-containing family, pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome (<a href=\"#bib29\">Murakami et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Horng, 2014</a>), which is accompanied by the release of processed caspase-1 (p20 subunit) and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 into culture supernatants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). Following photostimulation at 5 or 50 \u03bcW/mm<sup>2</sup>, we observed a notable light intensity-dependent boost in the production of IL-1\u03b2 and processed caspase -1 (p20 subunit) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed THP1-derived macrophages in the presence of a commonly used inflammasome inducer nigericin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>), thus confirming the feasibility of harnessing the power of light to amplify macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses ex vivo. In aggregate, light-induced activation of the Opto-CRAC channel can generate both global and local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and subsequently cause hallmark physiological responses in both model cellular systems (<i>e.g.,</i> HeLa or HEK293 cells) and rodent or human cells of the immune system."

In order to seek the possibility of controlling the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/NFAT pathway using light in the deep tissue penetrating near-infrared range, we explored the use of lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as the NIR light transducer (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sun et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gnach et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wu et al., 2015</a>).

Like direct blue light illumination, UCNPs were able to cause photoactivation of recombinant LOV2 proteins, as reflected by the absorbance changes following NIR light stimulation and the subsequent recovery to the dark state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>).

In HeLa cells expressing mCh-ORAI1-StrepTag, we detected remarkable local accumulation of UCNPs-Stv on the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>), confirming the cell-specific targeting of functionalized nanoparticles. To examine whether UCNPs-transduced blue light is sufficient to trigger the opening of Opto-CRAC channels, we monitored cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes using GCaMP6s in HeLa cells co-expressing LOVSoc, mCh-ORAI1-StrepTag and GCaMP6s following NIR light stimulation (980 nm). Within 20\u2009s, transfected HeLa cells exhibited a significant increase in GCaMP6s fluorescence, indicating a rapid rise in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that was evoked by NIR light (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). This was further confirmed by using a red-emitting Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator R-GECO1.2, which enabled recording of reversible Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuation cycles and circumvented the complications associated with potential direct activation of LOVSoc by the green light source used to excite GCaMP6 signals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). This increase was found to be caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through NIR-to-blue activated Opto-CRAC channels because cells incubated with the control NIR-to-green UCNPs (\u03b2-NaYF<sub>4</sub>: Yb, 2% Er @ \u03b2-NaYF<sub>4</sub>; emission maxima at 510 nm) did not show discernible changes in the GCaMP6s signal upon stimulation with the same NIR light (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We then employed NIR light to remotely activate the downstream effector NFAT at the cellular level, and observed NFAT nuclear translocation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>), as well as NFAT-dependent IFN-\u03b3 production in CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>). Next, we sought to demonstrate the potential application of NIR-triggered activation of the Opto-CRAC system in vivo. We performed a proof-of-principle experiment by implanting NFAT-Luc/LOVSoc expressing HeLa cells pre-incubated with UCNPs-Stv subcutaneously in the flanks of mice. The implanted site was irradiated by a 980-nm CW laser outside the body (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>) without noticeable heat production (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3a,b</a>) or severe damage to local tissues (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3c</a>). Luciferase-catalyzed bioluminescence was readily detected after NIR irradiation, whereas no discernible background activation was observed in the negative controls where LOVSoc expression and/or NIR light were absent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>)."

Dendritic cells, which provide the essential link between the innate and adaptive immune responses, are adept at capturing tumor antigens and cross-presenting these antigens to T cells in tumor draining lymph nodes (dLNs), thereby sensitizing and generating tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) to cause tumor regression or rejection (<a href=\"#bib34\">Palucka and Banchereau, 2012</a>). One of the major challenges of DC vaccination-based immunotherapy is how to efficiently maintain the maturational status of DCs. Pharmacological agents (<i>e.g</i>., ionomycin) or signaling pathways controlling intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization have been reported to facilitate immature dendritic cell maturation through up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 or CD86, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II, as well as the chemokine receptor CCR7 (<a href=\"#bib13\">F\u00e9lix et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Matzner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hsu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Koski et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Czerniecki, 1997</a>). We hypothesize that photoactivatable Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in DCs will lead to similar phenotypic changes to expedite and sustain DC maturation and promote antigen presentation, thereby maximally sensitizing T lymphocytes toward tumor antigens to boost anti-tumor immune response. To quickly test this in vitro, we transduced bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) with retroviruses encoding both LOVSoc and ORAI1<sup>StrepTag</sup> (termed 'Opto-CRAC DCs'), pulsed cells with a mixture of OVAp (<sub>257</sub>SIINFEKL<sub>264</sub>) and UCNPs-Stv nanoparticles. NIR light stimulation resulted in approximately 2\u20138 fold increase in the surface expression of MHC-I/II, CD86, and CCR7 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>), which are characteristic of matured DCs that are capable of homing to dLNs to interact with T cells to modulate adaptive immune response (<a href=\"#bib34\">Palucka and Banchereau, 2012</a>). We next used ex vivo\u00a0cross-presentation assay to examine how CD8\u2009T cells from OT-1 <i>Rag1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice respond to the OVA antigen presented by DCs. The isolated OT-1 CD8\u2009T cells, bearing transgenic T cell receptors that specifically recognize processed OVA peptides (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clarke et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hogquist et al., 1994</a>), were co-cultured with Opto-CRAC DCs in the presence of OVAp and UCNPs-Stv. After NIR stimulation, co-cultured OT-1 CD8\u2009T cells exhibited over 2-fold increase in both proliferation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>) and IFN-\u03b3 release (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>), clearly attesting to the feasibility of using the NIR-stimulable Opto-CRAC system to expand and photo-prime antigen-specific T cells."

We next adoptively transferred CFSE-abled, OVA-specific OT-I CD8\u2009T cells into the B16-OVA mice and examined their\u00a0in vivo\u00a0activation and phenotypic profiles following photoactivatable DC maturation. Compared to the control group shielded from NIR, the proliferation of CD8\u2009T cells was substantially up-regulated after light stimulation, by judging from decreased CFSE staining due to proliferative dilution and increased population of OT-1 CD8T cells in tumor draining LNs and spleens (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>). To assess the functional consequence of immunosensitization of tumor cells toward Opto-CRAC DC-activated immune response, we monitored the tumor growth in mouse melanoma models generated by either subcutaneous or <i>i.v.</i> injection of B16-OVA melanoma cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). NIR light stimulation significantly suppressed the tumor growth with diminished tumor volume (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>) or reduced numbers of tumor foci in the lungs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g</a>). Both our ex vivo and in vivo data converge to support the conclusion that NIR-stimulable Opto-CRAC DC can robustly enhance tumor cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing, thereby improving antigen-specific immune responses to selectively destruct tumor cells. By acting as a genetically-encoded 'photoactivatable adjuvant', the Opto-CRAC system may hold high potential for its future use in cancer immunotherapy."

Depending on the pulse and intensity of light input, the photosensitive module, LOVSoc, can reversibly generate both sustained and oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. The magnitude and kinetics of photo-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx largely mimic the physiological responses following engagement of immunoreceptors or ligand binding to its cognate membrane receptors that leads to store depletion (<a href=\"#bib38\">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</a>). Ectopic expression of a single component of LOVSoc at endogenous levels of ORAI is sufficient to elicit strong intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in a dozen of cell types derived from a wide range of human or rodent tissues. Most critically, light-generated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals can further lead to hallmark physiological responses in cells of the immune system. The sensitivity and photoactivation kinetics of this system can be further tuned by tethering LOVSoc to PM or through co-expression and fusion with ORAI1. When paired with deep tissue-penetrant and NIR-stimulable UCNPs, we have successfully demonstrated the potential application of our Opto-CRAC system to drive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gene expression and to photo-modulate immune response both\u00a0in vivo\u00a0and ex vivo. Compared to other existing optical tools, our Opto-CRAC system that has several distinctive features: First, complementary to the existing ChR-based tools that exhibit less stringent ion selectivity and tend to perturb intracellular pH due to high proton permeability, our Opto-CRAC system is engineered from a bona fide Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel that is regarded as one of the most Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective ion channels. Although the unitary conductance of CRAC channel is estimated to be low (&lt;10 fS in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in T cells; compared to 4\u201310 pS for voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zweifach and Lewis, 1993</a>), sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (up to minutes) through native ORAI1 channels is sufficient to activate downstream effectors. The high Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity (P<sub>Ca</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub>: &gt;1000) and its small unitary conductance is speculated to reduce the energy requirement of pumping out Na<sup>+</sup> during sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, thereby enhancing the specificity of downstream effector function (<a href=\"#bib38\">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</a>). Second, the Opto-CRAC tool has a relatively small size (&lt;900 bp, compared to &gt;2.2 kb of ChR) and is thus compatible with almost all existing viral vectors used for in vivo gene delivery. Indeed, we have successfully used retroviral and lentiviral expression systems to deliver Opto-CRAC into primary T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Its potential delivery into excitable tissues (<i>e.g.</i>, muscle, heart and brain) using adeno-associated viruses remains to be tested in follow-on studies. Third, the tunable and relatively slow kinetics make it most suitable for interrogating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-modulated functions in non-excitable cell types, such as cells in the endocrine, immune and hematopoietic system. We find that our system may find broad use in adoptive cell transfer experiments or adoptive immunotherapies, which are widely used in both basic research and the clinic settings (<a href=\"#bib34\">Palucka and Banchereau, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Restifo et al., 2012</a>). Fourth, in conjunction with upconversion nano-transducers, the light harvesting window can be shifted to the NIR region where deep tissue penetration and remote stimulation are feasible. Results from our in vivo studies clearly indicate that the Opto-CRAC channel and its downstream effectors can be remotely activated using NIR light, thereby paving the way for its future applications in more (patho)physiologically-relevant mouse models, or ultimately, in cancer immunotherapies with improved spatiotemporal control over engineered therapeutic T cells or DCs to reduce off-tumor cross-reaction and mitigate toxicity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Morgan et al., 2010</a>). Given the spatial and temporal accuracy of NIR light, it is also possible to use guided NIR light to confine localized blue light generation, thus avoiding the photoactivation of off-target regions. Lastly, but critically, the lanthanide-doped UCNPs can be applied to activate other optogenetic tools that are dependent on blue light-absorbing cofactors (<i>e.g.</i>, ChR2 and CRY2). We anticipate that the flexible adaptability of our novel approach will lead to new opportunities to fine-tune Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent immune responses and interrogate other light-controllable cellular processes while minimally interfering with the host\u2019s physiology."

Next, 75% of the media and non-adherent cells were removed and replaced with fresh culture medium. On day 5, transduced DCs were gently dislodged and pulsed for 3\u2009hr at 37\u00b0C with 2 \u03bcg/ml OVA<sub>257\u2013264</sub> peptide (GenScript) and 1 mg/ml UCNP-Stv nanoparticles. Cells were then washed to remove unattached peptide and nanoparticles. To generate OT-I CD8\u2009T cells, spleens and lymph nodes (LN) of OT-1 <i>Rag1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (purchased from the Jackson Laboratory) were pressed through a 70 \u03bcm cell strainer (BD Falcon). Untouched CD8\u2009T cells were sorted by using mouse CD8\u2009T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). 2x10<sup>4</sup> irradiated peptide loaded UCNPs-Stv/OVAp Opto-CRAC DCs were seeded in triplicates in 96-well U-bottom plates containing 5x10<sup>4</sup> purified OT-I CD8\u2009T cells in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl and co-cultured for 5 days with or without NIR light stimulation for 16h (1\u2009min pulse, 15 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). T cell proliferation was determined by labeling cultured cells with [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine at a concentration of 1 \u03bcCi/\u03bcL for 16\u2009hr and the radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer). To detect DCs maturation and migration, NIR-stimulated or unstimulated UCNPs-Stv Opto-CRAC DCs were stained with FITC-CD11c, PE-MHC-I, APC-MHC-II, PE-CD86 and PE-CCR7 and then subjected to flow cytometry analysis 3 days post-transduction. For intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining, OT-I CD8\u2009T cells were incubated with UCNPs-Stv/OVAp Opto-CRAC DCs for 6\u2009hr at 37\u00b0C in the presence of GolgiStop (monensin) (BD Pharmingen). Cells were then stained with surface marker using APC-CD8a antibody for 15\u2009min on ice and permeabilized using cytofix/cytoperm (BD Biosciences) for 30\u2009min on ice. Permeabilized cells were resuspended in BD Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences) and stained with PE-anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibody for 20\u2009min. Samples were run on a BD LSRII Flow Cytometer and analyzed by BD FACSDiva software."

B16-OVA cells were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (HyClone) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin under 37\u00b0C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. B16-OVA cells (1x10<sup>6</sup>) were injected <i>s.c.</i> into the flank region or <i>i.v.</i> via tail vein of <i>Rag1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (purchased from the Jackson Laboratory) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Overwijk and Restifo, 2001</a>). 3 days later, mice were injected <i>i.v.</i> with 2\u00d710<sup>5</sup> Opto-CRAC DCs treated with UCNPs-Stv and the surrogate tumor antigen OVA<sub>257-264</sub>. 1.5\u00d710<sup>6</sup> OT-I T cells labeled with CellTrace far red CFSE were <i>i.v.</i> injected into tumor-bearing mice. Briefly, cells were incubated at 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in CFSE at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcM for 20\u2009min at room temperature. The labeling reaction was stopped by adding the same volume of FBS. Recipient <i>Rag1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice were subjected to the excitation of NIR laser (8\u2009hr per day, 0.5\u20131\u2009min ON/OFF pulse, 30 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) or shielded from NIR (control group) for 6 days to stimulate Opto-CRAC DC maturation, with the initial two days concentrating more on areas nearby the draining lymph nodes of restricted mice. For in vivo T cell proliferation, spleen and draining popliteal and inguinal LNs were harvested and injected with collagenase D (1 mg/ml; Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) in RPMI and 10% FBS for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. Digested LN or spleen were filtered through a stainless-steel sieve, and the cell suspension was washed twice in PBS and 5% FBS. CFSE-labeled OT-I CD8\u2009T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. Tumor growth was measured at indicated time points using calipers shown in growth curve using the equation of V = Lx W<sup>2</sup>/2. Lungs were isolated and tumor foci of lung melanomas were counted from tumor-bearing mice shielded or exposed to NIR pulse from day 3\u20139 after B16-OVA tumor cell injection."

The high Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity of CRAC channels is a clear advantage over the current non-selective channelrodopsin-based optogenetic systems and the authors use this as a central justification for developing methods that would directly elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx instead of relying on membrane depolarization (in the channelrodopsin-based optogenetic systems) to activate endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The study develops a protein construct with LOV2 (a photoswitch that responds to blue-light) fused to a STIM1 C-terminal fragment. Using a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses Orai1 transfected with their chimeric construct, they demonstrate tight control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx using blue light. They also showed that NFAT-translocation, which is a downstream effect of CRAC channel activation, correlates with the frequency of the blue light-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses. In addition, the study pairs the opto construct with lanthanide-doped up conversion nanoparticles (UCNP) that absorb in the near-infrared wavelengths and emit blue light. This allowed control Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and NFAT-translocation in cells using near-infrared light, which is necessary in developing a system that can penetrate tissues in an in vivo system. Finally, as a proof-of-concept experiment, HeLa cells expressing the Opto-CRAC system are grafted subcutaneously into the flanks of mice and the manuscript demonstrates changes in NFAT-luciferase expression using near-infrared light in these cells under the skin. A light activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel could be tremendously useful for applications ranging from studies of basic biology of CRAC channels, local activation of CRAC channels in microdomains within cells, and in vivo interrogation of immune and other cells."

For NIR use in culture, the authors assemble a far more elaborate system than described for visible light, consisting of engineered STIM and ORAI proteins, streptavidin-coated UCNP beads and PMA (for gene induction). For in vivo use, they implant cells expressing the encoded components that have been pre-treated with beads subcutaneously, hardly a non-invasive procedure."

Nonetheless, we would like to stress that while ChR2 is most useful in neuroscience with respect to the control of neuronal excitability, our study aims to expand the repertoire of optogenetic tools, with the goal of photo-manipulating cellular events that occur at a relatively slower time scale (seconds to minutes). Here we primarily focus on cells of the immune system to present and advocate the concept of optogenetic immunomodulation. We have demonstrated the significance and wide adaptivity of our tool for different cellular systems. In a dozen of non-excitable cell types that we have tested thus far, the expression of LOVSoc alone was clearly sufficient to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at endogenous levels of ORAI1 and caused cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation of up to 500-800 nM (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The magnitude and relatively slow kinetics of photoactivated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx largely mimic the physiological events upon engagement of immunoreceptors (as reviewed Prakriya and Lewis, 2015). Although the unitary conductance of CRAC channel is known to be extremely low (~9 fS in 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> or 24 fS in isotonic Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution in T cells; compared to 4-10 pS for voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels; Prakriya and Lewis 2015), the sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (up to minutes) through native ORAI1 channels is sufficient to trigger downstream effectors. The small unitary conductance of the CRAC channel, coupled with its high Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity (with a Ca<sup>2+</sup>: Na<sup>+</sup> permeation ratio of over 1000; among the most selective Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels known), is speculated to limit membrane depolarization, thereby reducing the energy requirement to pump out Na<sup>+</sup> during sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and enhancing the specificity of downstream effector function (Prakriya and Lewis 2015). The physiological hallmarks of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/NFAT pathway can be fully recapitulated by our Opto-CRAC system."

Please note that we only used phorbol ester to mimic the co-stimulation pathway, in vitro, for the purpose of a simpler and convenient experimental setup, but it is not a must. For example, phorbol ester can be readily replaced by anti-CD28 antibody to trigger co-stimulatory signals. In addition, to drive light-inducible Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gene expression, we can circumvent the use of phorbol ester by fusing target genes (e.g., insulin) downstream of multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup>-response elements (Stanley et al., 2012), as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. Moreover, in the revised manuscript, rather than repeating similar experiments in T cells, we focused on other types of immune cells that obviate the need for co-stimulatory pathways. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4B</a>, light-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in macrophages and dendritic cells, without the use of phorbol ester, is sufficient to induce the downstream events to amplify inflammatory response or to promote DC antigen presentation."
