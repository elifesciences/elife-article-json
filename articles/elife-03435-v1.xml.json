After replication, there are two origins of replication, both of which are tethered to specific sites on the membrane (tethers shown in red). Cell elongation pulls the two origins of replication away from the centre of the cell, and this passively divides the DNA between the daughter cells. (<b>B</b>) During chromosome segregation in <i>C. crescentus</i>, one of the ParB-<i>parS</i> partition complexes (orange circles) remains at the original pole, while the other partition complex appears to be pulled towards the new pole at the opposite end of the cell by a cloud of the ParA enyzme (brown shading). (<b>C</b>) In the pulling model for DNA segregation, ParA bound to ATP can form a cytoskeletal filament (dark blue spheres), and the ParB in the partition complex (orange circle) can stimulate hydrolysis of the ParA-ATP to form ParA-ADP (light blue spheres): this causes one end of the filament to depolymerise. The partition complex remains attached to the filament, so it is pulled to one end of the cell as the filament undergoes depolymerisation, as are half of the chromosomes (not shown) in the cell. (<b>D</b>) In the diffusion-binding model the partition complex (and anything attached to it) can also end up at one pole of the cell as a result of diffusion. As in the pulling model shown in (<b>C</b>), this model relies on ParB stimulating the hydrolysis of ParA-ATP; overall the partition complex diffuses towards higher concentrations of ParA (<a href=\"#bib12\">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</a>). (<b>E</b>) In the DNA relay mechanism proposed by Lim et al., the ParB-<i>parS</i> complex (orange) attaches to ParA-ATP (dark blue spheres with green halos) bound to DNA and moves as a result of being stretched by the elastic forces of the chromosome (not shown), before the ParB stimulates the hydrolysis of ParA-ATP to form ParA-ADP (light blue spheres with green halos)."

In <i>C. crescentus</i>, prior to DNA replication, the ParA enzyme and the ParB-<i>parS</i> partition complex are spatially segregated: the partition complex resides at one end (or pole) of the cell, while the enzyme spreads out in a 'cloud' from the other end of the cell (<a href=\"#bib10\">Schofield et al., 2010</a>).

In this model, the partition complex diffuses through the cell and binds to ParA-ATP that is already bound to DNA. The ParB in the complex then stimulates the hydrolysis of the ATP, which results in the release of the complex. The complex then moves to a region where there is a higher concentration of ParA bound to DNA, and the whole process is repeated. The end result is that the partition complex (and any plasmid DNA attached to it) keeps moving in one direction."

Time-resolved microscopy also revealed that the partition complex moved in a way that is inconsistent with the existence of ParA filaments. The results of computational simulations, meanwhile, were not consistent with the diffusion-binding model."

In light of this observation, they considered the possibility that elastic forces within the DNA molecules themselves (modelled as springs) might power the segregation of chromosomes. Through a series of computations, using a number of experimentally derived parameters, they estimated the spring constant for chromosomes, as well as the magnitude of the forces acting on the partition complex."

In short, the partition complex is captured by ParA-ATP dimers that are bound to DNA. Forces exerted by the DNA stretch the complex, and by the time that hydrolysis has taken place, the complex has been pulled into a new position. Hydrolysis of ATP subsequently releases the complex. This hydrolysis also causes a lower concentration of ParA-ATP dimers in the vicinity of the partition complex and this results in the formation of the ParA protein gradient, with the highest concentrations of ParA-ATP being found at the new cell pole away from the partition complex. The partition complex is again captured by ParA-dimers bound to DNA. This results in the complex moving away from the old cell pole and towards the new cell pole. A repetition of these steps eventually leads to chromosome segregation."
