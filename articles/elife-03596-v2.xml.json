In this study, we report that the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of mammalian Sp8 transcription factor Buttonhead (Btd) prevents premature differentiation and cell cycle exit of INPs in <i>Drosophila</i> larval type II neuroblast (NB) lineages. We show that the loss of Btd leads to elimination of mature INPs due to premature differentiation of INPs into terminally dividing ganglion mother cells. We provide evidence to demonstrate that Btd prevents the premature differentiation by suppressing the expression of the homeodomain protein Prospero in immature INPs. We further show that Btd functions cooperatively with the Ets transcription factor Pointed P1 to promote the generation of INPs. Thus, our work reveals a critical mechanism that prevents premature differentiation and cell cycle exit of <i>Drosophila</i> INPs."

In this study, we report that the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of mammalian Sp8 transcription factor Buttonhead (Btd) prevents premature differentiation and cell cycle exit of INPs in <i>Drosophila</i> larval type II neuroblast (NB) lineages. We show that the loss of Btd leads to elimination of mature INPs due to premature differentiation of INPs into terminally dividing ganglion mother cells. We provide evidence to demonstrate that Btd prevents the premature differentiation by suppressing the expression of the homeodomain protein Prospero in immature INPs. We further show that Btd functions cooperatively with the Ets transcription factor Pointed P1 to promote the generation of INPs. Thus, our work reveals a critical mechanism that prevents premature differentiation and cell cycle exit of <i>Drosophila</i> INPs."

Transient amplification of INPs dramatically boosts the neural output from neural stem cells (NSCs) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Florio and Huttner, 2014</a>). Recent studies in developing human brains as well as other mammalian brains suggest that an expansion of the number of transiently amplifying INPs, the outer sub-ventricular zone radial glia-like cells (oRGs), likely contributes to the increased cortical size and complexity in humans and other gyrencephalic animals (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fietz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hansen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lui et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, accumulating body of evidence suggests that brain tumors could originate from dedifferentiation and unrestricted proliferation of INPs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Holland et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dai et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Walton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Persson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zong et al., 2012</a>).

There are 8 type II NBs in each brain lobe. Like mammalian NSCs, <i>Drosophila</i> type II NBs produce neurons and glia indirectly by generating INPs. Individual INPs undergo 4\u20136 rounds of asymmetric divisions to produce a new INP to self-renew and a ganglion mother cell (GMC), which divides terminally to produce neurons and/or glia (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bayraktar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Viktorin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). Meanwhile, individual INPs produce distinct types of neurons by sequentially expressing a set of distinct transcription factors to specify the identity of their progeny (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Through self-renewing divisions, INPs not only amplify the number but also increase the diversity of neural progeny generated from type II NBs. Therefore, the neurogenesis pattern in type II NB lineages is remarkably similar to that in mammalian brains and the <i>Drosophila</i> INPs are functionally analogous to mammalian INPs, particularly oRGs."

Newly generated INPs are immature and do not express any NB markers, such as the proneural protein Asense (Ase) or the bHLH protein Deadpan (Dpn), except for Miranda (Mira). The Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs first turn on the expression of Ase to become Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs. Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs then further differentiate to become mature INPs, which express both Ase and Dpn. INPs do not divide until they are fully mature. The maturation of INPs requires Numb, the NHL family protein Brain tumor (Brat), the transcription factor Earmuff (Erm), as well as the BAP and Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) chromatin remodeling complexes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bowman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Weng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Eroglu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Koe et al., 2014</a>). Both Numb and Brat are segregated into Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs during the division of type II NBs to prevent them from dedifferentiating into NB fate, but they function through independent pathways. Numb inhibits Notch activity in Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs, whereas Brat likely antagonizes the activity of the EGR family transcription factor Klumpfuss (Klu) and Armadillo/\u03b2-Catenin in Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bowman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Komori et al., 2014</a>). Erm functions together with BAP and HDAC3 chromatin remodeling complexes after Brat and Numb to further restrict the developmental potential of INPs by attenuating the response of INPs to self-renewal factors such as Klu and Dpn (<a href=\"#bib20\">Janssens et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Koe et al., 2014</a>). In addition, the BAP chromatin remodeling complex limits the self-renewal of INPs by activating the expression of Prdm protein Hamlet (<a href=\"#bib9\">Eroglu et al., 2014</a>). In the absence of Numb, Brat, Erm, or chromatin remodeling complexes, INPs dedifferentiate into type II NBs and initiate tumorigenic overproliferation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bowman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Weng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Eroglu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Koe et al., 2014</a>).

One major difference between INPs and GMCs is that INPs divide to self-renew whereas GMCs divide terminally (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bello et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boone and Doe, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bowman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, in addition to avoiding dedifferentiation and unrestricted tumorigenic overproliferation, INPs need to overcome another challenge\u2013to avoid over-differentiation and cell cycle exit\u2013in order to maintain their progenitor state and self-renewal while they differentiate to mature and undergo self-renewing divisions. Type II NBs and newly born Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs differ from type I NBs and GMCs by the lack of the expression of Ase and the homeodomain protein Prospero (Pros) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bello et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boone and Doe, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bowman et al., 2008</a>). In type I NB lineages, Pros is expressed in the cytoplasm in the NBs and translocates to the nucleus in GMCs to promote differentiation and cell cycle exit by inhibiting NB self-renewing genes and activating neural differentiation genes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li and Vaessin, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Choksi et al., 2006</a>). In type II NB lineages, Pros is not expressed in the NB or Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs. In Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs and mature INPs, Pros is expressed at low levels in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bello et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boone and Doe, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bowman et al., 2008</a>). It has been demonstrated that the lack of Ase and Pros in type II NBs and Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs is essential for the generation of self-renewing INPs in type II NB lineages. Forced expression of Ase or Pros in type II NBs and their progeny is sufficient to eliminate INPs although removing Ase or Pros in type I NBs does not change the identity of type I NBs or induce the generation of INPs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bowman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bayraktar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>). Our recent studies demonstrated that the Ets family transcription factor Pointed P1 (PntP1) suppresses Ase in type II NBs and is required for the generation of INPs (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). However, mechanisms that prevent premature differentiation of INPs and/or inhibit Pros expression in type II NBs and immature INPs are not known."

However, although forced expression of PntP1 suppress Ase expression in nearly all type I NB lineages, it induces the generation of INP-like cells only in a subset of type I NBs (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, it is likely that other protein(s) may function together with PntP1 to specify type II NB lineages and promote the generation of INPs. A recent functional genomic study showed that in addition to PntP1, there are other nine genes that are highly expressed in brain tumors derived from type II NB lineages (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carney et al., 2012</a>). We wondered whether any of these genes could function together with PntP1 to promote INP generation. To test this idea, we first examined how knockdown of these genes would affect INP generation in type II NB lineages. A normal type II NB lineage contains 2\u20133 Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs, 2\u20133 Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INP, and about 20\u201330 (26.9 \u00b1 4.1, mean \u00b1 SD) Ase<sup>+</sup> Dpn<sup>+</sup> mature INPs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013A\u2032,C\u2013C\u2032,G</a>). Interestingly, RNAi knockdown of Btd using the type II NB lineage-specific <i>pntP1-GAL4</i> (named as <i>GAL4</i><sup><i>14\u221294</i></sup> previously) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>) as a driver led to a complete elimination of mature INPs in about 50% of type II NB lineages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013B\u2032,G\u2013H</a>). Instead, only a few (3.7 \u00b1 1.2) Ase<sup>+</sup> Dpn<sup>\u2212</sup> cells were observed next to the Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013B\u2032</a>). However, type II NBs remain Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> as normal type II NBs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013B\u2032</a>), suggesting that the identity of the type II NBs was not affected by Btd RNAi knockdown."

                                "text": "Why does the loss of Btd lead to the elimination of mature INPs? When mature INPs are eliminated in the absence of Btd, the type II NBs without the ectopic Ase expression still produce Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs and a few Ase<sup>+</sup> Dpn<sup>\u2212</sup> daughter cells. In normal type II NB lineages, Ase<sup>+</sup> Dpn<sup>\u2212</sup> cells can be either Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs or GMCs. Therefore, three possible scenarios could happen when mature INPs are eliminated in the absence of Btd: 1) Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs differentiate into GMCs instead of Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs; 2) Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs differentiate into Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs, which then directly differentiate into neurons/glia without further dividing; 3) Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs differentiate into Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs, which in turn differentiate into terminally dividing GMCs. To distinguish these possibilities, we first wanted to determine if Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs still differentiate into Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INP in the absence of Btd by examining the expression of INP specific marker R9D11<i>-</i>CD4<i>-tdTomato</i> and progenitor marker Miranda (Mira) in the Ase<sup>+</sup> cells next to the Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs<i>.</i> R9D11<i>-</i>CD4<i>-tdTomato</i> utilizes a DNA fragment R9D11 from the <i>erm</i> promoter to drive the expression of CD4-tdTomato (<a href=\"#bib15\">Han et al., 2011</a>). In normal type II NB lineages, R9D11<i>-</i>CD4<i>-tdTomato</i> is first turned on in Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs and becomes stronger as INPs mature (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013A\u2032</a>), which is similar to R9D11<i>-mCD8-GFP</i> (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). Mira is expressed in all NBs as well as INPs but not (or very weakly) in GMCs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). In Btd RNAi knockdown type II NB lineages without mature INPs, we found that R9D11<i>-</i>CD4<i>-tdTomato</i> was expressed in Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells next to the Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs but its overall expression was much weaker than that in normal type II NB lineages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013B\u2032,I</a>). Consistently, Mira is also expressed in those Ase<sup>+</sup> cells next to the Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs in the Btd RNAi knockdown type II NB lineages (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The expression of R9D11<i>-</i>CD4<i>-tdTomato</i> and Mira suggests that Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs still differentiate into Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INP in the absence of Btd as in wild-type type II NB lineages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>)."

To reduce Pros expression, we either removed one wild-type copy of <i>pros</i> or knocked down Pros by RNAi in type II NB lineages. Remarkably, the elimination of mature INPs resulting from the Btd RNAi knockdown was nearly fully rescued even just by removing one wild-type copy of <i>pros</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D\u2032,I\u2013J</a>). Unlike Btd RNAi knockdown in wild-type background, which resulted in a completely elimination of mature INPs in about 50% of type II NB lineages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013B\u2032,G\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013B\u2032,I\u2013J</a>), knockdown of Btd in <i>pros</i><sup><i>17</i></sup> or <i>pros</i><sup><i>10419</i></sup> heterozygous mutant animals no longer led to an obvious loss of mature INPs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013D\u2032,I\u2013J</a>, and data not shown), although type II NB lineages develop normally in <i>pros</i><sup><i>17</i></sup> or <i>pros</i><sup><i>10419</i></sup> heterozygous mutant animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013C\u2032,I\u2013J</a>, and data not shown).

We next asked if Btd is also required to partially suppress Pros at later stages of INP development. In normal type II NB lineages, Pros is absent in Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs but is expressed at low levels in the cytoplasm of Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs and mature INPs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bello et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boone and Doe, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bowman et al., 2008</a>). Maintaining the expression of Pros at low levels is essential for the self-renewal of INPs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bayraktar et al., 2010</a>). However, the complete elimination of mature INPs makes it difficult to assess the role of Btd in mature INPs. Therefore, we used <i>erm-GAL4 (III)</i> and <i>erm-GAL4 (II)</i> to knock down Btd. Both <i>erm-GAL4 (III)</i> and <i>erm-GAL4 (II)</i> are expressed in Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs and mature INPs, whereas <i>erm-GAL4 (II)</i> is also expressed in Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs except for the newly born Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Xiao et al., 2012</a>). However, knockdown of Btd using either <i>erm-GAL4 (III)</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B\u2032\u2032,E</a>) or <i>erm-GAL4 (II)</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D\u2032\u2032,F</a>) did not result in any obvious loss of mature INPs in type II NB lineages. In line with these RNAi knockdown results, we were able to recover multicellular <i>btd</i> mutant INP clones that were comparable to wild-type INP clones (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) while we generated <i>btd</i> mutant type II NB clones, indicating that <i>btd</i> mutant INPs were still able to divide multiple rounds like wild-type INPs and did not prematurely differentiate into GMCs.

We showed previously that PntP1 is expressed in type II NBs as well as Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> and Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013A\u2032\u2032</a>) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). Inhibiting PntP1 activity results in ectopic Ase expression in type II NBs and elimination of INPs (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, we wondered if PntP1 expression was reduced or even lost in <i>btd</i> mutant type II NBs. Immunostaining of PntP1 showed that PntP1 was expressed at reduced levels in most <i>btd</i> mutant type II NB lineages without the ectopic Ase expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013B\u2032</a>). The reduction is about 10% in the NBs and 50% in the immature INPs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>). In those <i>btd</i> mutant clones, PntP1 was also detected in the Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells next to the Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013B\u2032</a>), providing additional evidence to support that Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs still differentiate into Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs in the absence of Btd. However, in <i>btd</i> mutant type II NB lineages with the ectopic Ase expression in the NB, PntP1 was largely abolished in both the NBs and their progeny (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013C\u2032,E\u2013F</a>).

Our results showed that expressing <i>UAS-pntP1</i> resulted in higher expression of PntP1 in <i>btd</i> mutant type II NB clones than that in neighboring <i>btd</i> heterozygous mutant type II NB lineages and suppressed the ectopic Ase expression in all <i>btd</i> mutant type II NBs (n = 12) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, unlike reducing Pros expression, which rescued mature INPs in nearly all <i>btd</i> mutant type II NB clones (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), expressing <i>UAS-pntP1</i> failed to rescue mature INPs or suppress the ectopic nuclear Pros in Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs or Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells in the majority of <i>btd</i> mutant clones (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Consistent with the inability of <i>UAS-pntP1</i> to fully rescue the loss of mature INPs, we found occasionally that <i>btd</i> mutant clones that did not show an obvious reduction of PntP1 in either the NBs or early immature INPs still failed to generate any mature INPs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The expression of <i>UAS-btd RNAi</i> driven by <i>btd-GAL4</i> completely eliminated mature INPs in nearly all type II NB lineages (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which was much stronger than the phenotype of Btd RNAi knockdown driven by <i>pntP1-GAL4</i>.

INP-like cells were identified by their expression of Ase and Dpn as well as INP-specific marker R9D11<i>-</i>CD4<i>-tdTomato</i>. Since the <i>GAL4</i> insertion in the <i>btd-GAL4</i> line causes a lethal mutation in <i>btd</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Estella et al., 2003</a>), we examined the phenotype of the expression of <i>UAS-pntP1</i> driven by <i>btd-GAL4</i> only in <i>btd-GAL4</i> heterozygous female larvae. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013A\u2032</a>, type II NB lineages in <i>btd-GAL4</i> heterozygous mutant larvae are indistinguishable from those in wild-type animals (e.g. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013A\u2032</a>). Furthermore, as mentioned above, <i>btd-GAL4</i> homozygous mutant type II NB clones develop normally (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, the generation of INPs is not affected in the <i>btd-GAL4</i> line.

The expression of <i>UAS-btd</i> alone neither suppressed Ase nor induced the generation of INP-like cells in VNCs (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), whereas in larval brains, the expression of <i>UAS-btd</i> driven by <i>insc-GAL4</i> suppressed/reduced the expression of Ase in the NB and promoted the generation of INP-like cells in about 20% of type I NB lineages (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G\u2013G\u2032,J</a>).

In addition, about 40% of <i>btd</i> mutant type II NB lineages ectopically express Ase in the NB and become type I-like NB lineages. However, although forced expression of Ase in type II NBs is sufficient to eliminate INPs in type II NB lineages (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bowman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>), the loss of INPs is obviously not primarily due to the ectopic Ase expression or the transformation of type II NB lineages into type I-like NB lineage in that the loss of mature INPs occurs independently of the ectopic Ase expression in most <i>btd</i> mutant or Btd RNAi knockdown type II NB lineages. Instead, we demonstrate that the loss of mature INPs in the absence of Btd is due to the premature differentiation of Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs into GMCs. We show that in Btd RNAi knockdown or <i>btd</i> mutant type II NB lineages without the ectopic Ase expression, Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs differentiate into Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs normally as indicated by the expression of R9D11-mCD8-GFP, Mira, as well as PntP1 in Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells next to the Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs. However, instead of differentiating into mature INPs, we argue that Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs prematurely differentiate into GMCs based on the following two pieces of evidence. First, Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells eventually undergo terminal divisions as indicated by the positive pH3 staining and the position of the pH3-positive cells. Second, unlike mature INPs, the dividing Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells do not form basal Mira crescent at metaphase. The terminal division and the lack of Mira crescent during the division are two unique features that distinguish GMCs from INPs in addition to the expression of nuclear Pros (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ikeshima-Kataoka et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Matsuzaki et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schuldt et al., 1998</a>).

                                "text": "Why does the loss of Btd lead to premature differentiation of INPs? Our results show that the loss of Btd results in a reduction or loss of PntP1 in type II NBs and immature INPs as well as ectopic expression of Pros in early immature INPs. Our previous studies show that PntP1 suppresses Ase in type II NBs and that inhibiting PntP1 activity leads to ectopic expression of Ase in type II NBs and elimination of INPs (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). Given that the ectopic Ase expression in <i>btd</i> mutant type II NBs is closely associated with the severe reduction or complete loss of PntP1 and that expression of <i>UAS-pntP1</i> largely suppresses the ectopic Ase expression in <i>btd</i> mutant type II NBs, the severe reduction or loss of PntP1 most likely accounts for the ectopic Ase expression in <i>btd</i> mutant type II NBs. However, although the loss of PntP1 could lead to the loss of INPs, we provide several lines of evidence to demonstrate that the elimination of INPs in <i>btd</i> mutant or Btd RNAi knockdown type II NB lineages is primarily due to the ectopic activation of Pros in immature INPs rather than the reduction or loss of PntP1. First, ectopic nuclear Pros is consistently expressed in Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs when mature INPs are eliminated. Second, the loss of mature INPs can be fully rescued by Pros RNAi knockdown or even just by removing one wild-type copy of <i>pros</i>. Third, Pros RNAi knockdown also rescues the reduction of PntP1 and suppresses the ectopic Ase expression in <i>btd</i> mutant type II NBs. In contrast, the expression of <i>UAS-pntP1</i> fails to rescue mature INPs in most <i>btd</i> mutant type II NB lineages although it largely suppresses the ectopic Ase expression in the NBs. Furthermore, the complete elimination of mature INPs is also observed occasionally in <i>btd</i> mutant type II NB lineages without the reduction of PntP1. Therefore, the elimination of mature INPs resulting from the loss of Btd is primarily due to the ectopic Pros expression, which likely promotes premature differentiation of INPs into GMCs and cell cycle exit. The severe reduction or loss of PntP1 is responsible for the ectopic Ase expression in <i>btd</i> mutant type II NBs and is more likely a secondary effect due to the ectopic Pros expression and/or the loss of INPs. INPs and/or other progeny may provide feedback signals to the NBs as has been demonstrated in other systems (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yoon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hsu et al., 2014</a>)."

Btd was known as a head gap gene. It has been suggested that gap factors act largely as transcriptional repressors (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schroeder et al., 2004</a>). Btd could directly suppress Pros by binding to the <i>pros</i> promoter as a transcriptional repressor. Alternatively, Btd could suppress Pros indirectly by regulating the expression or antagonizing the activity of factor(s) that activate(s) <i>pros</i> expression. Our results show that ectopic/overly expression of Btd in type I NB lineages or mature INPs does not lead to overproliferation of type I NBs as observed in <i>pros</i> mutant type I NB lineages. Instead, ectopic expression of Btd promotes the generation of INP-like cells from type I NBs and transforms some type I NB lineages into type II-like NB lineages. Therefore, it is more likely that Btd suppresses Pros indirectly by regulating the expression or antagonizing the activity of <i>pros</i> activator(s). Previous studies have suggested that Ase, Daughterless, Numb, and Erm could activate <i>pros</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib34\">Reddy and Rodrigues, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Southall and Brand, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Weng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yasugi et al., 2014</a>). Since Ase and R9D11-Cd4-tdTomato, which are under the control of <i>erm</i> promoter, are not expressed in Ase<sup>\u2212</sup> immature INPs in the absence of Btd, it is unlikely that they are involved in the activation of <i>pros</i> in immature INPs. It would be interesting to investigate in the future if Numb or Daughterless could activate <i>pros</i> in immature INPs in the absence of Btd."

Consistently, the ability of PntP1 to promote the generation of INP-like cells in <i>btd</i> mutant type I NB lineages is largely impaired. These results suggest that the specification of type II NB lineages and the generation of INPs requires both PntP1 and Btd and that the combinatorial PntP1 and Btd is sufficient to promote the generation of INPs."

PntP1 is responsible for the suppression of Ase in type II NBs. Meanwhile, PntP1 must be regulating the expression of other unknown target gene(s) that are/is essential for the generation of INPs, such as specification of immature INPs, because loss of Ase is not sufficient to promote the generation of INP-like cells in any type I NB lineages. Btd likely acts after PntP1 to mainly prevent premature differentiation of INPs into GMCs by indirectly suppressing <i>pros</i> in immature INPs. The role of Btd in suppressing Ase in type II NBs is minimal if there is any because unlike PntP1, which suppresses <i>ase</i> in nearly all type I NBs when it is ectopically expressed, overexpression of Btd only suppresses Ase in a small subset of type I NBs that produce INP-like cells in larval brains. Furthermore, Ase is expressed in Btd<sup>+</sup> type I NBs, indicating that Btd does not suppress Ase in type I NBs when it is expressed at normal levels. Studies in mammals as well as in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that the Btd/Sp8 could function downstream of Wnt signaling to regulate the expression of Fgf8 as well as Distal-less (Dll) and Headcase (Hdc) during the forebrain patterning as well as limb development (<a href=\"#bib11\">Estella et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Treichel et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kawakami et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sahara et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Estella and Mann, 2010</a>). However, inhibiting Wnt signaling alone in type II NB lineages does not have any obvious phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Komori et al., 2014</a>), indicating that Btd unlikely functions downstream of Wnt signaling in type II NB lineages. Whether Fgf8, Dll, or Hdc could function downstream of Btd to regulate INP generation remains to be investigated in the future."

In the developing mouse forebrain, Sp8 is expressed in cortical progenitors in a mediolateral gradient across the ventricular zone as well as in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) and medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sahara et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zembrzycki et al., 2007</a>). In developing human brains, Sp8 is abundantly expressed in the ventricular zone and the outer sub-ventricular zone where RGs and oRGs reside (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ma et al., 2013</a>). In addition to its roles in interneuron development and the patterning of developing mammalian brains and spinal cords (<a href=\"#bib14\">Griesel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Waclaw et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sahara et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2011</a>), it was also shown that the loss of Sp8 led to the reduction of the progenitor pool (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zembrzycki et al., 2007</a>). Our results show that mammalian Sp8 can rescue the loss of mature INPs resulting from the loss of Btd in <i>Drosophila</i>, suggesting that Btd/Sp8 could have conserved functions across different species. It would be interesting to investigate if Sp8 has similar roles in promoting the generation of transient amplifying INPs, such as oRGs, in developing mammalian brains."

INPs play a crucial role in mammalian brain development and understanding how they form and proliferate is therefore a central question in neurobiology. In a previous study, the authors have shown that the Ets transcription factor Pointed P1 (PntP1) is required for the specification of Type-II NB lineages in <i>Drosophila</i> larval brains. PntP1 suppresses Asense (As) expression in NBs, which promotes the formation of INPs. Here, Xie et al. show that the product of the button head gene (btd) works cooperatively with PntP1 to generate functional INPs."

Xie et al. elegantly demonstrate that this phenotype is due to the ectopic expression of Prospero (Pros) in the nuclei of newly generated INPs. Thus, btd prevents premature differentiation of INPs by repressing early Pros expression. The authors then test whether the btd phenotype might be due to the loss of PntP1. They show that although PntP1 expression decreases in the NBs of btd mutant type-II lineages (leading to ectopic Ase expression in a subset of these NBs), this defect is not at the origin of the loss of mature INPs. It is instead a secondary effect of the ectopic expression of Pros. These results nicely confirm the key role played by btd in the formation of mature INPs. Finally, Xie et al. show that co-expressing btd with PntP1 in type-I NB lineages is sufficient to convert most of them into type-II NB lineages. The major finding reported is that the transcription factor encoding btd gene is required in INPs to prevent their premature differentiation, and that this occurs because btd suppresses the (nuclear) expression of the homeodomain protein Prospero in INP sublineages. These interesting data add to our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of the (limited) proliferative potential of INPs in the <i>Drosophila</i> neural stem cell model. This paper is interesting, well written, and the data are convincing."

There are two reasons for this. First, enhancer-reporter constructs do not necessarily reflect endogenous protein expression. Moreover, if enhancer-reporter constructs do mimic endogenous expression in one tissue, this does not prove that the constructs mimic endogenous expression in other tissues. Clearly, immunolabelling or <i>in situ</i> hybridization would be preferable and should be added to the paper if an antibody is available. If this is not available, the authors should make sure that they explain that they have made all the controls to test whether the Gal4 line reproduces the expression pattern. In particular, the ability to rescue the loss of function phenotype with the human construct is a good argument that the Gal4 line is expressed in the right tissue. Rescue with the fly UAS construct should be added to confirm this."

There are two reasons for this. First, enhancer-reporter constructs do not necessarily reflect endogenous protein expression. Moreover, if enhancer-reporter constructs do mimic endogenous expression in one tissue, this does not prove that the constructs mimic endogenous expression in other tissues. Clearly, immunolabelling or in situ hybridization would be preferable and should be added to the paper if an antibody is available. If this is not available, the authors should make sure that they explain that they have made all the controls to test whether the Gal4 line reproduces the expression pattern. In particular, the ability to rescue the loss of function phenotype with the human construct is a good argument that the Gal4 line is expressed in the right tissue. Rescue with the fly UAS construct should be added to confirm this.</i>"

However, we tried to generate btd antibodies using two different approaches (using a synthesized peptide and GST-btd fusion proteins), but had no luck. We also tried very hard to detect <i>btd</i> mRNAs by <i>in situ</i> hybridization. We got very nice in situ hybridization signals in the larval optic lobe (which is consistent with the expression of <i>btd-GAL4</i> in the optic lobe) and ventral imaginal discs, but we were not able to detect strong signals in the central brain or in the ventral nerve cord. Therefore, in order to test whether the <i>btd-GAL4</i> line reproduces the endogenous expression pattern, we tried to rescue the loss of function phenotype of Btd with the expression of mouse Sp8 construct (sorry we did not have the human Sp8 construct) or fly btd construct driven by <i>btd-GAL4</i> as reviewers suggested. Ideally this rescue should be done in <i>btd</i> mutant clones. However, we were not able to do such rescue experiments for the following two reasons:"

The embryonic lethality of the <i>btd-GAL4</i> line could be due to the loss of Btd in other tissue or cells.

In a new supplemental figure (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 2</a>), we showed that Btd RNAi knockdown driven by <i>btd-GAL4</i> completely eliminated mature INPs in nearly all type II NB lineages, which is much stronger than that of Btd RNAi knockdown driven by <i>pntP1-GAL4</i> (this could also indicate that the expression of <i>btd-GAL4</i> is likely more close to the endogenous expression pattern of Btd than <i>pntP1-GAL4</i> so that the knockdown of Btd driven by <i>btd-GAL4</i> is more efficient <i>pntP1-GAL4</i>, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the higher RNAi knockdown efficiency is due to the difference of the expression levels of <i>btd-GAL4</i> and <i>pntP1-GAL4</i>). This Btd RNAi knockdown phenotype could be fully rescued by the expression of <i>UAS-mSp8</i> driven by the same <i>btd-GAL4</i>. However, the expression of <i>UAS-btd</i> driven by <i>btd-GAL4</i> could only partially rescue the Btd RNAi knockdown phenotype.

In any event, the rescue of the Btd RNAi knockdown phenotypes by the expression of <i>UAS-mSP8</i> and <i>UAS-btd</i> driven by <i>btd-GAL4,</i> together with strong <i>btd</i> mutant phenotypes in type II NB lineages (and the failure of PntP1 to induced INP-like cells in btd mutant type I NB lineages), strongly argue that <i>btd-GAL4</i> reflects the endogenous expression pattern of <i>btd</i>."
