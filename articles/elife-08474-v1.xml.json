Natural killer (NK) cells become activated when the receptor NKG2D is engaged by ligands that are frequently upregulated in primary tumors and on cancer cell lines. However, the molecular mechanisms driving NKG2D ligand expression on tumor cells are not well defined. Using a forward genetic screen in a tumor-derived human cell line, we identified several novel factors supporting expression of the NKG2D ligand ULBP1. Our results show stepwise contributions of independent pathways working at multiple stages of ULBP1 biogenesis. Deeper investigation of selected hits from the screen showed that the transcription factor ATF4 drives <i>ULBP1</i> gene expression in cancer cell lines, while the RNA-binding protein RBM4 supports ULBP1 expression by suppressing a novel alternatively spliced isoform of <i>ULBP1</i> mRNA. These findings offer insight into the stress pathways that alert the immune system to danger."

Natural killer (NK) cells become activated when the receptor NKG2D is engaged by ligands that are frequently upregulated in primary tumors and on cancer cell lines. However, the molecular mechanisms driving NKG2D ligand expression on tumor cells are not well defined. Using a forward genetic screen in a tumor-derived human cell line, we identified several novel factors supporting expression of the NKG2D ligand ULBP1. Our results show stepwise contributions of independent pathways working at multiple stages of ULBP1 biogenesis. Deeper investigation of selected hits from the screen showed that the transcription factor ATF4 drives <i>ULBP1</i> gene expression in cancer cell lines, while the RNA-binding protein RBM4 supports ULBP1 expression by suppressing a novel alternatively spliced isoform of <i>ULBP1</i> mRNA. These findings offer insight into the stress pathways that alert the immune system to danger."

Yet, the body's immune system can often detect and destroy abnormal cells before they cause tumors and disease. Natural killer cells are part of the immune system and have receptors on their surface that allow them to tell the difference between healthy host cells and host cells that are stressed or abnormal. Some of these receptors activate the natural killer cells when they bind to their target molecules. Other receptors have the opposite effect and inhibit the natural killer cells. Activation occurs when the signaling from the activating receptors is stronger than the signals from the inhibitory receptors."

Humans express up to eight NKG2D ligands (ULBP1-6, MICA, and MICB), and mice express 5\u20136 different ligands, depending on the strain (RAE-1\u03b1-\u03b5, H60a-c, and MULT1) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Raulet et al., 2013</a>). Healthy cells typically do not display NKG2D ligands on their surface and are thus poor targets for NKG2D-mediated lysis by NK cells. However, cellular stresses associated with transformation, viral infection, or other danger to the host cause the upregulation of NKG2D ligand expression (<a href=\"#bib52\">Raulet et al., 2013</a>). Primary tumors and cancer cell lines frequently express one or more NKG2D ligand, and NKG2D expression is important for the control of tumors in vivo in models of spontaneous cancer (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guerra et al., 2008</a>)."

In the case of NKG2D-mediated tumor recognition, published results suggest that one mechanism of tumor immune evasion is the loss or decreased expression of NKG2D ligands (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guerra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">McGilvray et al., 2009</a>). In other cases, tumors progress despite sustained expression of NKG2D ligands (<a href=\"#bib73\">Vetter et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Guerra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">McGilvray et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hilpert et al., 2012</a>). The evidence as a whole suggests that upregulation of NKG2D ligands on early stage tumor cells is part of a host defense mechanism, but that the immune response subsequently applies selective pressure for tumors that have either extinguished expression of NKG2D ligands or have activated immune suppressive mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib53\">Raulet and Guerra, 2009</a>). Therefore, identifying factors and pathways that regulate NKG2D ligands will improve our understanding of the cellular properties used by the immune system to define unwanted cells and will also help reveal how tumors evade the corresponding immune responses."

Such approaches have implicated the DNA damage response pathway (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gasser et al., 2005</a>), heat shock (<a href=\"#bib72\">Venkataraman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nice et al., 2009</a>), hyperproliferation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jung et al., 2012</a>), and pattern recognition receptors (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hamerman et al., 2004</a>), among others, in the regulation of one or more NKG2D ligands. However, these pathways do not account fully for expression of ligands in tumor cells, since inhibiting them may decrease ligand expression but typically does not abrogate it. For example, the DNA damage response is active in many cancer cells and tumor cell lines, but inhibiting that pathway only partially inhibits ligand expression (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gasser et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gasser and Raulet, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Soriani et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, hyperproliferation can drive NKG2D ligand expression, but blocking proliferation does not completely eliminate NKG2D ligand expression by tumor cell lines (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jung et al., 2012</a>). These findings suggest that unidentified molecular cues in tumor cells also initiate the expression of NKG2D ligands, allowing potentially dangerous tumor cells to be distinguished from normal cells. Identifying those cues, especially for human NKG2D ligands, is important for understanding the biological regulation of NKG2D ligands and devising approaches for immunotherapy based on that knowledge."

To identify novel drivers of human NKG2D ligand expression in transformed cells, we employed a retroviral gene-trap mutagenesis screen using the near-haploid human cell line HAP1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carette et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carette et al., 2011</a>). Like many cell lines, HAP1 cells express multiple NKG2D ligands (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We chose to screen for drivers of ULBP1 expression because it showed the brightest staining on HAP1 cells, making it particularly amenable to our loss-of-expression screen. Following mutagenesis, we selected for mutants with decreased expression of ULBP1 but intact expression of the unrelated GPI-anchored protein CD55 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Selection of CD55<sup>+</sup> cells was used to reduce the fraction of selected cells that had lost ULBP1 expression due to mutations that alter cell surface expression of all proteins or of all GPI-linked proteins. In the first round of selection, we depleted ULBP1<sup>high</sup> cells from the mutant cell population using magnetic bead-based depletion of cells labeled with a ULBP1 antibody. After briefly expanding the selected cells, we used flow cytometry to further select for ULBP1<sup>low</sup>CD55<sup>+</sup> cells. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> shows ULBP1 and CD55 expression on WT and post-selection HAP1 cells."

The <i>ULBP1</i> gene was targeted for comparison. After HAP1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding Cas9 and guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for each candidate gene, a population of ULBP1<sup>low</sup> cells appeared that was absent in control transfected cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In each case, individual ULBP1<sup>low</sup> cells were sorted into 96-well plates, and expanded clones were screened for mutations by PCR and sequencing. For further analysis, we selected clones with insertions or deletions that resulted in frameshift mutations in each targeted gene (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Since the sites targeted were near the beginning of each coding region and the cells are haploid, the frameshift mutations are expected to result in complete loss-of-function of the corresponding proteins. Analysis of HAP1 cell lysates by Western blot confirmed the loss-of-protein expression in ATF4, RBM4, and SPCS2 mutant cell lines (data not shown)."

The effect of each mutation was specific to ULBP1, as we found no change in cell surface expression of other proteins, including four other NKG2D ligands (ULBP2, ULBP3, MICA, and MICB), HLA Class I, the unrelated GPI-anchored protein CD59, or PVR and Nectin-2, the ligands for DNAM-1, another NK cell-activating receptor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The minor changes in ULBP3 staining seen in <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a> were not consistently observed across experiments. The finding that the mutations each affect only ULBP1 among the NKG2D ligands tested supports the hypothesis that different NKG2D ligands are subject to distinct regulatory processes. It was surprising that <i>SPCS1</i> and <i>SPCS2</i> mutations only impacted cell surface staining of ULBP1 and not the six other membrane proteins tested, as we had expected that mutating components of the signal peptidase complex would cause a more generalized defect in cell surface protein expression (see \u2018Discussion\u2019). In all cases, ULBP1 expression on mutant lines could be restored by re-expressing the gene of interest with a doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vector (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These findings established that ATF4, RBM4, HSPA13, SPCS1, and SPCS2 each contribute partially to cell surface display of ULBP1 in HAP1 cells in steady-state culture conditions."

The entire <i>ATF4</i> gene was deleted in the resulting mutant lines, eliminating the possibility of the mutant cells expressing a functional ATF4 protein fragment. HAP1 cells carrying a similar deletion of <i>ATF4</i> had an identical phenotype to the <i>ATF4</i> frameshift mutant line described above (data not shown).

In contrast, ATF4-deficiency in Jurkat cells resulted in a modest reduction in <i>ULBP1</i> mRNA and a barely detectable reduction in ULBP1 cell surface staining.

Such stresses, including amino acid starvation, the unfolded protein response (UPR), oxidative stress, and the presence of dsRNA, induce ATF4 through phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rutkowski and Kaufman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Suragani et al., 2012</a>). Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 globally suppresses protein translation but selectively activates the translation of ATF4 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Harding et al., 2000</a>). The transcriptional targets of ATF4 include amino acid transporters and protein chaperones, which in combination with the overall reduction in protein synthesis help mitigate the cellular stress (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harding et al., 2003</a>). However, ATF4 expression also drives the expression of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP (GADD153), suggesting that ATF4 not only drives adaptation to stress but also promotes cell death if the stress cannot be overcome (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tabas and Ron, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Han et al., 2013</a>). Increased ATF4 expression has been detected in some tumors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bi et al., 2005</a>), providing a possible mechanism for coupling malignant transformation to expression of ULBP1, and consequently to tumor immunosurveillance."

Histidinol or thapsigargin treatment each significantly induced <i>ULBP1</i> mRNA in WT K-562, HAP1, and Jurkat cells, but induction was abrogated or severely blunted when cells lacked ATF4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Induction of <i>ULBP1</i> transcription by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Butler et al., 2009</a>) was not prevented in the <i>ATF4</i>-mutant cells (data not shown), indicating that certain cellular perturbations transcriptionally activate <i>ULBP1</i> independently of ATF4. RNA-Seq analysis of HAP1 cells confirmed ATF4-dependent upregulation of <i>ULBP1</i> mRNA in response to histidinol treatment (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). RT-qPCR analysis of other NKG2D ligands expressed by HAP1 cells showed that histidinol treatment caused an increase in <i>ULBP2</i> mRNA that was partially ATF4-dependent, while <i>MICA</i> expression was slightly decreased in an ATF4-independent manner (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). <i>ULBP3</i> and <i>MICB</i> transcripts were not affected by histidinol treatment or loss of ATF4 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). <i>ULBP4</i>, <i>ULBP5</i>, and <i>ULBP6</i> mRNAs were absent or barely detectable by RNA-Seq analysis of untreated HAP1 cells, and those genes showed no sign of induction by histidinol (data not shown).

Although histidinol and thapsigargin induce transcription of ATF4-regulated genes, they also inhibit protein synthesis, both directly (e.g., by limiting the availability of charged histidine tRNAs) and indirectly, by causing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. These opposing effects make it difficult to predict whether stress induction will result in increased amounts of any specific protein encoded by an ATF4-regulated gene. Nevertheless, in K-562 cells, we observed a dramatic ATF4-dependent induction of cell surface ULBP1 by histidinol (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>). In HAP1 and Jurkat cells, in contrast, addition of histidinol induced ULBP1 cell surface expression slightly in WT cells, but caused decreased ULBP1 expression in <i>ATF4</i>-mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>), consistent with the aforementioned inhibition of protein synthesis resulting from histidinol treatments. Indeed, histidinol treatments resulted in substantially decreased cell surface expression of HLA proteins, which are not regulated by ATF4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,E</a>). As summarized in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, the overall effect of ATF4 induction by histidinol was to induce and/or maintain ULBP1 cell surface expression in the face of global protein synthesis inhibition associated with this stress pathway."

No other notable ATF4 binding was observed in the 266 kb interval shown, which includes genes encoding five other functional NKG2D ligands (<i>ULBP2-6; RAET1K</i> is a pseudogene), at least two of which are expressed in HAP1 cells (<i>ULBP2</i> and <i>ULBP3</i>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, data not shown).

We compared WT and <i>RBM4</i> KO HAP1 cells by RNA-Seq to determine a potential role of RBM4 in splicing of <i>ULBP1</i> transcripts. As a result, we discovered a novel isoform of <i>ULBP1</i> that to our knowledge has not been previously reported (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The sequence of the novel isoform has been deposited in GenBank (Accession number KT591165). Analysis of sequence reads that aligned to splice junctions revealed that most transcripts in WT cells exhibited the expected splicing pattern to encode the normal ULBP1 protein (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). In <i>RBM4</i> KO cells, in contrast, approximately 60% of transcripts had undergone an alternative splicing event of the first and second exons in which the 5\u02b9 splice site at the 3\u02b9 border of the first exon was ignored in favor of a 5\u02b9 splice site located 1.3 kb downstream within the first intron (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Splicing of the downstream exons of <i>ULBP1</i> appeared normal in <i>RBM4</i> KO cells. The alternatively spliced transcript in <i>RBM4</i> KO cells encodes a premature stop codon shortly after the predicted ER signal peptide and is thus unlikely to encode a functional protein fragment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

Loss-of-function mutations in each of the corresponding genes resulted in relatively modest reductions in cell surface ULBP1 when examined separately. The capacity of the screen to detect mutations that each have relatively small effects demonstrates its remarkable power to identify pathways that function in a partially redundant fashion. Overall, the data suggest that most of the pathways studied control different steps in the biogenesis of ULBP1, with ATF4 controlling transcription, RBM4 regulating RNA splicing, and HSPA13, SCPS1, and SPCS2 regulating co-translational or post-translational steps such as protein processing. The power of the CRISPR/Cas9 method to rapidly generate double- and triple-mutant cell lines led to the finding that disabling multiple regulators resulted in much more striking reductions in ULBP1 expression than disabling them individually. Thus, each regulator contributes incrementally to ULBP1 expression. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that stress pathways might cumulatively control the amount of a given NKG2D ligand displayed on the cell to define a quantitative \u2018threat level\u2019 confronting a cell (<a href=\"#bib52\">Raulet et al., 2013</a>).

In some cases, expression of ULBP1 may be critically dependent on ATF4. This is the case in unstimulated K-562 cells in which basal ULBP1 expression was detected (though weakly) in WT cells but was absent from the surface of <i>ATF4</i> KO cells. In other cases, exemplified by HAP1 and Jurkat cells, numerous factors contribute to ULBP1 expression, with ATF4 being only one of them. Those cells had higher basal ULBP1 expression than K-562 cells and showed a modest decrease in ULBP1 expression when <i>ATF4</i> was mutated."

Outcomes at the level of protein expression are difficult to predict a priori, because these stressors induce transcription of ATF4 target genes, but also cause global suppression of translation as a result of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. We observed a range of outcomes in different cell lines. Amino acid starvation of K-562 cells, imparted by histidinol treatment, caused a substantial increase in <i>ULBP1</i> mRNA and surface protein, and the response was ablated in <i>ATF4</i> KO cells. In this case, the increase in <i>ULBP1</i> transcription overwhelmed the global decrease in translation. In contrast, in HAP1 and Jurkat cells, amino acid starvation of WT cells caused a fivefold to sevenfold increase in <i>ULBP1</i> mRNA, but a much smaller increase in ULBP1 protein at the cell surface. Nevertheless, the impact of ATF4 was made apparent by the observation that ULBP1 protein levels <i>decreased</i> on the surface of similarly stressed <i>ATF4</i> KO cells. In these cell lines, therefore, the induction of <i>ULBP1</i> transcription by ATF4 serves to <i>maintain</i> (and slightly increase) expression of ULBP1 protein in the face of cellular stress. Maintaining ULBP1 expression that is induced by distinct regulatory pathways is important in cells where translational inhibition is likely to occur, such as in hypoxic tumors."

                                "text": "Our finding that <i>ULBP1</i> expression is regulated by ATF4 fits the existing paradigm for ATF4 target genes. ATF4 is induced by amino acid starvation, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and the UPR. ATF4 target genes include amino acid transporters, anti-oxidant response genes, angiogenic factors, and protein chaperones, and thus, ATF4 initially promotes cell survival against these insults (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jain, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Roybal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Han et al., 2013</a>). Previous studies have shown that ATF4 expression is frequently induced in primary tumors and tumor cell lines (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fernandez et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shuda et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ma and Hendershot, 2004</a>). Inadequate vascularization can cause tumors to become hypoxic and nutrient-starved, two conditions known to induce ATF4. Indeed, ATF4 expression is highest in hypoxic regions of tumors (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ameri et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bi et al., 2005</a>). However, the pro-apoptotic targets of ATF4, such as <i>CHOP</i>, provide an important safety mechanism for the host (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tabas and Ron, 2011</a>). Without a pro-apoptotic component, the transcriptional targets of ATF4 would be ripe for exploitation by expanding tumors, which are often poorly vascularized, and consequently both hypoxic and starved. Upregulation of ULBP1 by ATF4 provides an additional layer of host defense, marking potentially dangerous cells for elimination by the immune system. Although not explored in this study, induction of ULBP1 by ATF4 may also play a role in antiviral immunity. As mentioned above, ATF4 expression is induced by phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. Viral infection can activate PERK and PKR, which phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 and therefore induce ATF4 expression (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mohr and Sonenberg, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jheng et al., 2014</a>)."

RBM4-deficient cells exhibited a twofold to threefold reduction in cell surface ULBP1 and the corresponding canonical <i>ULBP1</i> mRNA isoform. Interestingly, RBM4 suppresses a novel alternative splicing event in the <i>ULBP1</i> transcript. In the absence of RBM4, total <i>ULBP1</i> mRNA levels were unchanged, but the alternatively spliced isoform was upregulated while the canonically spliced isoform was downregulated. The alternative <i>ULBP1</i> transcript contains a premature stop codon early in the protein-coding sequence and is unlikely to produce a functional protein. Transcripts containing premature stop codons can be targets for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Maquat, 2004</a>), but we could nonetheless detect the alternative <i>ULBP1</i> transcript by RNA-Seq. The degree to which the alternative <i>ULBP1</i> transcript is degraded by NMD is presently unclear. RBM4 has also been implicated in other forms of gene regulation, including translation and microRNA-mediated gene silencing (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lin and Tarn, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Uniacke et al., 2012</a>). In HAP1 cells, however, the change in cell surface ULBP1 in <i>RBM4</i> KO cells was commensurate with the change in canonically spliced transcripts, suggesting that these other mechanisms do not play an appreciable role. It remains possible that RBM4 influences ULBP1 translation or gene expression in other cells or contexts."

Most interesting, in light of our findings, was the finding based on RNA-Seq analysis that RBM4 expression promoted a tumor-suppressive splicing profile (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wang et al., 2014a</a>). This action occurred in part through the alternative splicing of the <i>BCL2L1</i> gene (<i>Bcl-x</i>), wherein RBM4 promoted splicing that generated the pro-apoptotic isoform Bcl-xS, at the expense of the anti-apoptotic isoform Bcl-xL. Our data suggest that RBM4 further promotes tumor suppression by favoring the canonical splicing of <i>ULBP1</i> mRNA, marking cells for elimination by the immune system. Decreased RBM4 expression has been observed in various cancers compared to paired healthy tissues, including lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Furthermore, lower RBM4 expression correlated with decreased patient survival (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wang et al., 2014a</a>). We speculate that tumor cells are under selective pressure to downregulate RBM4 expression, as this would allow tumors to evade tumor-suppressive events such as expression of Bcl-xS and ULBP1."

They identify several hits that are confirmed by CRISPR/Cas9 gene inactivation. The major emphasis of the manuscript is on ATF4, which is shown to positively regulate ULBP1 in two other cancer cell lines. This effect is accentuated by activation of the unfolded protein response, and is relatively selective for ULBP1 in comparison to other NKGD2 ligands. Consistent with this, ATF4 is shown to bind near the <i>ULBP1</i> promoter, but not near genes encoding other NKGD2 ligands. The authors further show that a second hit, RBM4, is required for appropriate splicing of ULBP1. The authors conclude that their findings provide insights into the stress pathways that alert the immune system to danger. Overall the experiments appear to be carefully performed and clearly establish ATF4 and RBM4 as regulators of the expression ULBP1 in the cell lines examined. There was substantial enthusiasm for these findings among the three reviewers. One reviewer remarked: \u201cOverall this paper provides new information on the regulation of NKG2D ligands expression, identifying 5 molecules previously unknown to be involved in ULBP1 expression. The method used is elegant, the results are convincing and the paper is well written.\u201d A second reviewer commented: \u201cOverall this is an excellent and insightful study with novel findings that are fully supported by the data and importantly advance the field on NKG2D/NKG2DL research.\u201d"

The authors conclude that binding of ATF4 to the <i>ULBP1</i> gene indicates direct transcriptional control. That is almost certainly the case given the other evidence, but DNA binding per se is not a sufficient proof of direct regulation. Many transcription factor binding events are not associated with gene activation when assessed on a genome-wide scale. An assessment of the requirement of the binding site for activation is needed.
