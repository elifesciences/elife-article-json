Despite its importance the mechanisms regulating proteasome activity are only incompletely understood. Here we use an iterative and tightly integrated experimental and modelling approach to develop, explore and validate mechanistic models of proteasomal peptide-hydrolysis dynamics. The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme and its activity varies over time because of interactions between substrates and products and the proteolytic and regulatory sites; the locations of these sites and the interactions between them are predicted by the model, and experimentally supported. The analysis suggests that the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of the substrates into the proteasome. The transport efficiency varies between human standard- and immuno-proteasomes thereby impinging upon total degradation rate and substrate cleavage-site usage."

Despite its importance the mechanisms regulating proteasome activity are only incompletely understood. Here we use an iterative and tightly integrated experimental and modelling approach to develop, explore and validate mechanistic models of proteasomal peptide-hydrolysis dynamics. The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme and its activity varies over time because of interactions between substrates and products and the proteolytic and regulatory sites; the locations of these sites and the interactions between them are predicted by the model, and experimentally supported. The analysis suggests that the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of the substrates into the proteasome. The transport efficiency varies between human standard- and immuno-proteasomes thereby impinging upon total degradation rate and substrate cleavage-site usage."

Upon an inflammatory stimulus such as IFN-\u03b3 the catalytic standard \u03b21, \u03b22 and \u03b25 subunits peculiar of the standard proteasome (s-proteasome) are replaced by the immuno-subunits \u03b21i, \u03b22i and \u03b25i in the newly synthesized immunoproteasome (i-proteasome). Proteasome isoforms degrade substrates with different rates, but generate the same peptide pool (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mishto et al., 2014</a>). And while there exist differences between substrates, the 20S i-proteasome has been shown often to have a higher polypeptide degradation rate than its standard counterpart (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bellavista et al., 2013</a>). Why s- or i-proteasomes should degrade specific substrates more rapidly is a matter of ongoing debate. Different steps of the proteolysis process may be responsible for isoform specific kinetics: transport of the substrate through the gate and the antechambers; binding to substrate binding sites and ensuing peptide-bond hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huber et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arciniega et al., 2014</a>); and the release from the substrate binding sites and finally from the proteasome gate.

Furthermore, i-proteasome deficient mice show altered proteasome-dependent kinetics of pathogen epitope generation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Basler et al., 2013</a>).

Here considering different mechanisms, coupled to state-of-the art statistical model selection techniques (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kirk et al., 2013</a>), allows us to elucidate steps in the proteasomal dynamics that cannot be probed directly through experiments.

The changing substrate cleavage site usage over time might be the result of substrate depletion that leads to the re-entry and cutting of peptide products, thus acting as competitive inhibitors. This would lead to a decrease of the average length of the peptides products due to further cleavages and thus further shortening of the initial products. However, we observe only a slight reduction in the average length of the peptide products in the polypeptide degradations, only at late time points, and only when less than 50% of the substrate is still intact (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). By contrast, the changes in cleavage site usage are already becoming evident at early time points (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Therefore substrate depletion, product re-entry or further cleavage cannot explain variation in cleavage site usage over time."

We employ the two-site-modifier scheme of <a href=\"#bib46\">Schmidtke et al. (2000)</a>, who have already argued against the use of MM-types model for analysing proteasome function, and we adapt it to allow for product and substrate inhibition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, the substrate inhibition model still fails to reproduce our data, which can be clearly seen in the case of Z-LLE-MCA degradation (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>, blue curves). The intermediate complexes are assumed to be in quasi-steady state (which holds for all proteases studied so far), which allows us to reduce the overall complexity of the mathematical description without loss of information (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sanft et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Grima et al., 2014</a>)."

The number of substrate molecules that can enter the chambers is determined by the maximum capacity (<i>C</i>\u2014number of molecules that can be allocated in the proteasome chamber). This number depends on the volume of the proteasome chamber and the volume of the molecules. Since different substrate molecules differ in volume, the maximal capacity is expected to differ as well. The rate <i>v</i><sub><i>in</i></sub> is dependent on how many molecules are already located inside the proteasome chamber. If the number of molecules inside the chamber reaches the maximal capacity <i>C</i>, the rate by which new molecules enter the chamber is decreased. Since the exact mechanism for this process is unknown we formulate a heuristic expression that decreases the rate as a function of the number of molecules inside the chamber and the maximal capacity (see <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, section 2)."

There is already evidence for non-catalytic regulatory sites in proteasomes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schmidtke et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kisselev et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2003</a>). In particular, <a href=\"#bib25\">Kisselev et al. (2002)</a> and <a href=\"#bib26\">Kisselev et al. (2003)</a> identified two enhancers of the degradation rate of Suc-FLF-MNA and Suc-LLVY-MNA molecules, but not of Boc-LRR-MCA. We therefore expect that Suc-LLVY-MCA will enhance its own hydrolysis through a positive feedback loop (self-activation). Indeed, the degradation rate of Suc-LLVY-MCA by mouse proteasome progressively accelerates within 90 min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), and the degradation rate of the substrate Bz-VGR-MCA increases in the presence of the peptide LLVY (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)\u2014this is indirect evidence for the existence of feedback. The resulting time course shows an initially low reaction velocity, which then increases over time. This phenomenon is more pronounced at substrate concentration above 40 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To test whether the progressive increase of the enhancing effect of LLVY peptide over time is due to slow kinetics of the binding to non-catalytic modifier sites we pre-incubate mouse proteasome with LLVY peptide prior to the start of the degradation of the substrates Suc-LLVY-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA. The enhancing activity of LLVY is maximal for shorter pre-incubation, but the initial acceleration remains the same (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thus the progressive acceleration over time of the two substrates' degradations is not due to slow binding of the LLVY peptide to non-catalytic modifier sites. Instead the data suggest that peptide-bond hydrolysis is mandatory for the enhancing effect by LLVY peptide."

We also find evidence for a transport inhibiting regulatory site located on the proteasome surface. Combining the description of the substrate transport and the substrate hydrolysis at the active site, the resulting model now accounts for the previously described, but never wholly explained, observations: reduction of product generation long before substrate depletion (<a href=\"#bib51\">Stein et al., 1996</a>); and substrate inhibition at early and late time points (<a href=\"#bib51\">Stein et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schmidtke et al., 2000</a>).

Like we have observed for the mouse proteasome, human 20S proteasome purified from T2 (s-proteasome) and LcL (i-proteasome) cell lines shows degradation dynamics of short fluorogenic peptide that vary over time (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This is not due to variation of proteasome functionality as pre-incubation of the proteasome without substrate at 37\u00b0C for 18 hr does not alter its activity (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), in agreement with what is observed for mouse proteasome (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Similarly, the substrate cleavage preferences within the LLO<sub>291\u2013317</sub> polypeptide by s- and i-proteasomes vary over time, and not because of product re-entry. We observe modification of the cleavage site usage already at early time points (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). However, a slight reduction in the average peptide products length, as would be expected to result from further peptide product fragmentation, is evident only at late time points and with less than the 50% of the substrate still intact (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This observation is in agreement with an analysis of the production efficiency of peptides derived from the tested polypeptide substrate: these vary already at early time points and show marked differences between s- and i-proteasomes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mishto et al., 2014</a>)."

Since we are interested in the rate limiting steps of the proteolysis, we need to determine the reaction that has the strongest potential to increase product formation. We test the influence of the gate affinity, peptide influx, hydrolysis, peptide translocation and peptide efflux as well as initial gate size (simultaneous change of influx and efflux) on the product formation. We compute the fold-change in product formation when increasing one of these reactions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), and perform this analysis in silico using 320 \u03bcM substrate (the same analysis using 80 \u03bcM can be found in <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

The degradation of Z-LLE-MCA is limited by the efficiency of the hydrolysis, which induces the strongest increase in product formation. None of the peptide transport related reactions can increase the overall proteasome activity. When using 80 \u03bcM Z-LLE-MCA the hydrolysis is still the main rate limiting step, but the gate size has a similar impact (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Even though experimentally we can only observe the total amount of product produced over time (grey dots in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the kinetic model now provides information about the separate steps involved in the substrate degradation. In <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> we plot the total product concentration (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), the amount of substrate and product inside the proteasome chamber over time (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). For all three substrates we observe that with increasing substrate concentration the proteasome chamber fills up faster with peptides. For Z-LLE-MCA we observe a more rapid filling compared to Suc LLVY-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA, where the filling lasts approximately 6 hr. When plotting the amount of product inside the chamber relative to the total amount of peptides in the chamber, we find that Suc-LLVY-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA are cleaved immediately once inside the chamber (90% of peptides are products) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This shows that, for the substrates Suc-LLVY-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA, the transport inside the chamber, rather than the binding to the catalytic site and the peptide-bond hydrolysis, regulates how fast these substrates are degraded. The posterior parameter distributions show that Z-LLE-MCA substrate is transported faster than Suc-LLVY-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, vin and v<sub>out</sub>). This results in the rapid accumulation of Z-LLE-MCA molecules inside the proteasome chamber. Even though the catalysis rates (k<sub>p</sub>) of the three substrates are the same, Z-LLE-MCA hydrolysis is strongly influenced by both product and substrate inhibition (this is indicated by the very small values for the parameter \u03b2).

First, we predict in silico the kinetic effect of the Rpt peptides\u2014which open the gate by binding the \u03b1 subunit tails (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gillette et al., 2008</a>)\u2014on the hydrolysis rate of s- and i-proteasomes over time. According to our simulation the enhancing effect of Rpt should be strongest at early time points and decrease over time (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). We also predict that at early time points the effect of Rpt will be larger in s-proteasome when hydrolysing Suc-LLVY-MCA than in i-proteasomes, although over time the enhancing effects are the same. A similar effect is predicted for proteasomal hydrolysis of the Bz-VGR-MCA substrate in presence of Rpt peptides, although s-proteasome is predicted to remain higher than i-proteasome also at later time points (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Third, we predict that both proteasome types will initially have the same enhancing effect while digesting Z-LLE-MCA substrate, but that this effect becomes stronger over time for i-proteasomes. The in vitro experiments verify these three nontrivial in silico predictions. The small quantitative deviations can be explained by the use of a simplified model for the functioning of Rpt peptides (multiplication of the parameter <i>v</i><sub><i>in</i></sub> by a constant factor), which is expected to be more complex in reality. But this comparison validates that transport is indeed the rate limiting step (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>)."

Modelling helps us to understand how the 20S proteasome catalyzes the degradation of specific proteins in cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pickering and Davies, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Ben-Nissan and Sharon, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">H\u00f6hn and Grune, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fabre et al., 2015</a>); it also forms the basis for future studies of the main active forms of proteasome in cells, for example, when it is bound to the regulatory complexes 19S and PA28 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fabre et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, in 19S or PA28 single-capped proteasomes all steps considered in our model are still present, including the regulation of the gate by non-catalytic modifier site(s) and the gate binding affinity since one of the proteasome gates is not bound to the regulatory complexes and will therefore be regulated as described here."

It suggests that with the present model we describe a core of proteasome features that could reflect proteasome dynamics also in more complex scenarios such as might exist inside the cellular environment. Our model therefore also provides an interpretative framework for general studies of proteasome action, keeping in mind that substrate-specific effects need to be accounted for (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mishto et al., 2014</a>). Simple (e.g., MM-type) models, which have been largely used in analysing proteasome functionality so far, are clearly not capable of describing proteasome dynamics; this is becoming apparent since time-course data is much less forgiving and harder to fit to than for example, dose-response curves. The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme and its catalytic activity varies over time in a way that can only be understood if the structural characteristics of the proteasome are taken into account. Kinetics change over longer time scales than the structural dynamics described by <a href=\"#bib38\">Osmulski et al. (2009)</a> and they are influenced by the interactions of substrates and products with both proteolytic and regulatory sites. Our analysis suggests that the cavity of 20S proteasomes is progressively filled by peptides that can further facilitate other molecules to enter the chambers until the effective cavity volume has been almost completely filled. In fact, the estimated numbers of substrate and product molecules (<i>C</i>) that are inside the proteasome cavity are close to the possible maxima (<a href=\"#B2\">Box 2</a>). Peptide accumulation over time leads to activation of non-catalytic modifier sites, which our analysis shows to be located inside the proteasome cavity."

C describes the maximal number of molecules of a given substrate can be allocated inside the proteasome chamber at the same time. C is dependent on the volume of the proteasome chamber and on the volume of the substrate molecules. For this reason C is expected to be substrate specific. The model estimates of C for the three tested substrates are in agreement with values predicted by computing the maximal number of substrates that could be located inside the proteasome chamber. The estimated volumes for Suc-LLVY-MCA, Z-LLE-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA are approx. 936 A<sup>3</sup>, 741 A<sup>3</sup> and 606 A<sup>3</sup>, respectively (with an MCA group of 200 A<sup>3</sup>). This results in a ratio of 1.25 for Suc-LLVY-MCA:Z-LLE-MCA (model estimate: 1.24), 1.36 for Suc-LLVY-MCA:Bz-VGR-MCA (model estimate: 1.46) and 1.08 for Z-LLE-MCA:Bz-VGR-MCA (model estimate: 1.12). The exact number of molecules inside the chamber depends on the maximum possible density, but is approximately estimated to be 250, 310 and 337 for Suc-LLVY-MCA, Z-LLE-MCA and Bz- VGR-MCA, respectively, which is in the same order of magnitude as the model estimates (200, 249 and 293). Note, computed values are the maximal possible amount of molecules that could be packed inside the chamber. However, under physiological conditions the actual number of molecules that can be filled in the proteasome cavity has to be smaller, which is reflected in our model estimates."

The integration of data into our mathematical model clearly shows that peptide transport is the major rate limiting step in the degradation of short fluorogenic substrates: all models/hypotheses that do not account for this are soundly rejected. Hydrolysis is only rate limiting for the degradation of Z-LLE-MCA. We stress that for the short fluorogenic substrates the rate limiting steps are conserved across the different proteasomes (mouse proteasome and human s- and i-proteasomes). This in turn suggests that the interspecies homology of the proteasome structure results in preserving transport characteristics, although subtle structural variations can quantitatively modify the transport, as observed by comparing s- and i-proteasomes."

(2015)</a>, who identified preferential binding between the \u03b1 subunits of s- and i-proteasomes and specific regulatory complexes. Such differences can become dominant driving forces. For instance, the degradation of the substrate Bz-VGR-MCA is not influenced by differences in the active site-related parameters\u2014as is correctly predicted by our model. This also agrees with comparisons of the crystallographic structures of the mouse s- and i-proteasomes, which identify only minor variations between the \u03b22 and \u03b22i catalytic pockets (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huber et al., 2012</a>). By contrast, the catalytic sites of s-proteasome have stronger binding affinity for the substrate Z-LLE-MCA than the i-proteasome, which could be explained by the structural differences between \u03b21 and \u03b21i catalytic pockets described by <a href=\"#bib20\">Huber et al. (2012)</a>. For the degradation of the substrate Suc-LLVY-MCA our model predicts that the i-proteasome has higher substrate-binding affinity, higher hydrolysis rate, and lower cooperativity than the s-proteasome. This prediction is corroborated by the recent study of <a href=\"#bib2\">Arciniega et al. (2014)</a>, who showed that the \u03b25i pocket is more prone to bind and process substrates than the \u03b25 pocket; however, only s-proteasome is able to modify its conformation upon substrate binding to the \u03b25 subunit (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arciniega et al., 2014</a>), which is also correctly captured by our model as increased cooperativity (<i>n</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>)."

They developed the alternative mechanistic models of proteasome proteolysis by comparison with experimental data. In particular, they sequentially added mechanistic components on the simple model one-by-one based on both literatures and discrepancies with experimental observation. This is quite reasonable and careful way to develop the alternative models. They performed the statistical model selection using ABC-SMC, and found that the compartmentalised model with affinity transport and enhancing (inside) and inhibiting (outside) regulatory sites is the most plausible. Using the selected model, they further analyzed two distinct types of proteasomes; s- and i-proteasomes. They characterized the quantitative difference between the two proteaomes by posterior parameters distributions, and found that the gate size is a rate-limiting step for Suc-LLVY-MCVA and Bz-VGR-MCA, while hydrolysis for Z-LLE-MCA. Such distinct characteristics were also confirmed by experiments."

This approximation has been shown to be a valid representation the enzymatic models (Grima, 2009; <a href=\"#bib18\">Grima et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sanft et al., 2011</a>; Schnell, 2014), that does not loose information under the conditions that we have in our experimental setup. The quasi-steady state assumption holds if the catalytic rates are small compared to the on and off rates of ligand binding. For all proteases studied so far this assumption has been found to be valid; the cleaving action of the active site is complex (reviewed in (Liepe et al., 2014)), and the effective rate low; the on and off binding reactions at room temperature are fast. Of all the model reduction techniques discussed in the literature, the Michaelis-Menten mechanism has been explored and validated most completely(G\u00f3mez-Uribe et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2008; Smadbeck and Kaznessis, 2012). There are good pragmatic reasons for using suitably simplified models; more complicated models (e.g. those not relying on the quasi-steady-state assumption) tend to be plagued by non-identifiable parameters (Chis et al., 2014; Raue et al., 2011). We found this to be the case, especially for full model descriptions of the SI model. Such non-identifiabilities can (and do) result in numerical errors for certain parameter combinations. The latter is a known problem when exploring the model parameter space (Engl et al., 2009; Erguler et al., 2011; Ru\u00e9 et al., 2010)."

However, we agree with the referees that considered in this way these models would not be hierarchical extensions of a simpler model. We have now changed these two models so that they are based on the SI model with an additional positive feedback loop. The equations are corrected and the model selection was repeated based on the corrected model descriptions. In this way the first 4 models are hierarchical, starting from the simplest MM model, via the SI model and finally the most complex models with positive feedback loops."

We agree that for a given substrate the maximal capacity could potentially be similar for different proteasome isoforms. Indeed, when inferring the parameters for s- and i-proteasomes we find that the marginal posterior distributions for C are the same. However, incorporation of several other subunits into a multimer may drastically change the kinetic properties of the complex as a whole (see for example Cardozo, J Biol Chem. 1998 Jul 3;273(27):16764-70). Furthermore, the maximal capacity is dependent on the substrate volume, and the electrostatic properties of the different substrates (which differ considerably for the three substrates). Since the short fluorogenic substrates LLVY-MCA, LLE-MCA and VGR-MCA differ in their amino acid composition and therefore in their respective approximate volumes, we expect that the numbers of substrate molecules that fit into the proteasome chamber will also differ. We have expanded <a href=\"#B2\">Box 2</a> of section 4 in the <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> in order to clarify this. In particular, we have added a better definition of the maximal capacity in <a href=\"#B2\">Box 2</a> as well as in the main text."

However, because we cannot exclude that different substrates might bind with different kinetics to potentially different proteasome isoforms we prefer to infer <i>X</i><sub><i>enh</i></sub> separately for the three substrates. We furthermore have to allow for the possibility that <i>X</i><sub><i>enh</i></sub> might differ between proteasome isoforms. By hindsight (and in agreement with the reviewers\u2019 intuition), however, our inference results in identical marginal posterior parameter distributions for <i>X</i><sub><i>enh</i></sub> when comparing s- and i-proteasomes, suggesting that <i>X</i><sub><i>enh</i></sub> is indeed conserved between these two isoforms."

The inner cavity is mainly positively charged. The three investigated substrates differ in their partial charges (LLVY: 0, LLE: -1, VGR: +1). These partial charges can allow the substrates to be transported faster or slower. To test for this we inferred the parameter \u03c4 independently for each substrate and isoform. We do not detect any significant differences for \u03c4 between s- and i-proteasomes. But we find that LLVY is transported more efficiently than LLE and VGR, likely because of the absence of partial charges on LLVY, and therefore this substrate has fewer interactions with the inner proteasome cavity."

This factor was the same for all three substrates and it was not calibrated in any way against known or measurable Rpt properties. This is a very simple approximation of the functioning of Rpt peptides, which in reality should have a binding kinetic to the alpha-rings, and upon binding, induce a conformational change that results in an increased <i>v</i><sub><i>in</i></sub> rate for each substrate. Furthermore, since Rpt is changing the gate conformation, the rate <i>v</i><sub><i>out</i></sub> might also be influenced, i.e. increased by a factor. In the revised version we calibrated these factors for each of the three substrates and now obtain quantitative similar time courses of the in silico predictions and the experimental results. Even though this way we have explored the mechanism of Rpt in more detail, there are still many other characteristics of Rpt peptides that can alter the hydrolysis, but which are ignored in the in silico predictions. For example, Rpt peptides might themselves be transported inside the proteasome chamber and be in competition with the actual substrates for chamber capacity and/or active site binding.
