By placing the first slide onto top of the second, one can find out if any of the proteins on the first slide are enzymes that can use the protein of interest on the second slide as their substrate. Tu et al. tested thousands of proteins from <i>E.\u00a0coli</i> against three different substrate slides. The three potential substrates were proteins that are acetylated heavily in <i>E.\u00a0coli</i> cells, but are not deacetylated by CobB. They found that an <i>E.\u00a0coli</i> protein called YcgC was a lysine deacetylase that has RutR \u2013 a protein that regulates transcription in <i>E.\u00a0coli</i> \u2013 as a substrate. Further experiments revealed that, unlike other lysine deacetylases, YcgC does not require a cofactor. Tu et al. then used mass spectrometry techniques to find two specific lysine residues in RutR that are targeted by YcgC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Several YcgC homologs were identified in several genera of bacteria, including <i>Shigella</i> and <i>Yersinia</i>. Furthermore, because YcgC and its homologs do not require NAD<sup>+</sup> or zinc ions as a cofactor and look different from known bacterial lysine deacetylases, they likely represent a new family of lysine deacetylases."

However, as demonstrated by the fact that deacetylation leads to the removal of the N-terminus of RutR, this work reveals that they can also be coupled to irreversible protein modifications."
