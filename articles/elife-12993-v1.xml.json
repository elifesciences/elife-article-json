However, the mechanisms mediating their emergence and subsequent refinement remain poorly understood in general. Here, we demonstrate that correlated neural activity allows for the emergence of an invariant representation of natural communication stimuli that is further refined across successive stages of processing in the weakly electric fish <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>. Importantly, different patterns of input resulting from the same natural communication stimulus occurring in different contexts all gave rise to similar behavioral responses. Our results thus reveal how a generic neural circuit performs an elegant computation that mediates the emergence and refinement of an invariant neural representation of natural stimuli that most likely constitutes a neural correlate of perception."

Therefore, Metzen et al. recorded the activity of the receptor neurons that first respond to communication calls in weakly electric fish. The results revealed that a given communication signal made the firing patterns of all receptor neurons in the fish\u2019s brain more similar to each other, regardless of the signal\u2019s context. This occurs despite the changes in context causing single receptor neurons to respond in different ways. At each stage of the process by which information is transmitted from the receptor neurons to neurons deeper in the brain, the similarity in the neurons\u2019 firing patterns is refined, thereby giving rise to perceptual invariance."

Several studies have shown that neurons located in more central brain areas tend to respond more selectively to stimuli than neurons located in more peripheral brain areas (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rolls and Tovee, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Perez-Orive et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Olshausen and Field, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hromadka et al., 2008</a>). At the same time, however, neural representations in more central brain areas become more robust to the differential patterns of sensory input associated with a given stimulus (e.g. those experienced when looking at the same object under different levels of illumination). Such invariant representations are thought to mediate context-independent object recognition and have been observed across sensory modalities (auditory: [<a href=\"#bib8\">Bendor and Wang, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barbour, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bizley and Cohen, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Rabinowitz et al., 2013</a>]; visual: [<a href=\"#bib68\">Quiroga et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Zoccolan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Rust and Dicarlo, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">DiCarlo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Sharpee et al., 2013</a>]; somatosensory: [<a href=\"#bib28\">DiCarlo and Johnson, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Pei et al., 2010</a>]; olfactory: [<a href=\"#bib83\">Stopfer et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Cleland et al., 2007</a>]). Modeling studies have proposed that such representations are built and refined in a feedforward manner across successive brain areas by using OR-like operations (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kouh and Poggio, 2008</a>). Indeed, these studies suggest that combining neural activities that are locally invariant to complementary subsets of stimulus waveforms associated with a given object should then give rise to a more globally invariant representation. However, the actual computations used by the brain that give rise to invariant neural representations remain poorly understood to this day."

These fish generate a quasi-sinusoidal electric organ discharge\u00a0(EOD) at a typical individual frequency, resulting in an electric field that surrounds the body. EOD perturbations are sensed by an array of electroreceptors that synapse onto pyramidal neurons within the hindbrain electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) that in turn synapse onto neurons within the midbrain Torus semicircularis (TS). When two conspecifics come into contact (&lt;1\u2009m), each fish experiences a sinusoidal amplitude modulation (i.e. beat) with a frequency that is equal to the difference between the two EOD frequencies. Natural communication signals or chirps consist of transient increases in EOD frequency and always occur simultaneously with the beat under natural conditions. Stimulus waveforms associated with chirps can be uniquely characterized by the increase in EOD frequency, duration, and the beat phase at onset. It has long been recognized that chirp\u00a0stimulus waveforms are highly heterogeneous (<a href=\"#bib93\">Zupanc and Maler, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hup\u00e9 and lewis., 2008</a>). Interestingly, a recent study has shown that, while duration and frequency increase of chirps were both narrowly distributed, the beat phase at chirp onset was instead uniformly distributed over the entire beat cycle (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</a>). This suggests that the observed heterogeneities in stimulus waveforms are, at least in part, caused by the fact that a\u00a0chirp with given frequency increase and duration can occur with equal probability at any phase of the beat cycle."

A recent study has, furthermore, shown that some TS neurons can respond similarly to different chirp stimulus waveforms (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</a>).

In the absence of communication signals (i.e. when both EOD frequencies are constant), interference between the emitter and receiver fish\u2019s EODs gives rise to a sinusoidal amplitude modulation as mentioned above (i.e. the beat) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Natural communication stimuli (i.e. chirps) occur during social interactions in which the emitter fish sends the signal to the receiver fish (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The chirp consists of one fish increasing its EOD frequency for a short duration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, top red/green trace), which, when considering the resulting stimulus sensed by the receiver fish, consists of a transient perturbation of the underlying beat (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, black bottom trace). Because a chirp with a given EOD frequency timecourse (i.e. 'identity') can occur with uniform probability at all phases of the beat (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</a>), the resulting stimulus waveforms display significant heterogeneities (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, gray bands, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We therefore investigated whether and, if so, how neural responses across successive stages of processing to a chirp with given identity were similar irrespective of its occurrence within the beat cycle and, importantly, whether these constitute a neural correlate of behavior. We will henceforth refer to this concept as 'phase invariance'."

Single afferent responses consisted of patterns of excitation and inhibition that strongly depended on the stimulus waveform that was presented (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, blue curves). Indeed, population-averaged responses strongly varied depending on where the chirp occurred within the beat cycle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Afferents were excited when the chirp occurred at beat phases lower than 180\u00b0 and inhibited when it occurred at beat phases greater or equal to 180\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, blue curve). We shall henceforth refer to the stimulus waveforms that gave rise to excitation and inhibition as '+ chirps' and '- chirps', respectively. The similarity between single afferent firing rate responses to different waveforms during a 30 ms time window commensurate with chirp duration was then compared to that obtained between the stimulus waveforms during the same time window in order to measure phase invariance (see Methods). An invariance score near zero indicates that the response waveforms display heterogeneities that are similar to those displayed by the stimulus waveforms while a value near one implies that the response waveforms are all the same. We found that the invariance score for single afferents was near zero (mean: 0.11 \u00b1 0.01; max: 0.15; min: 0.07; population: 0.08) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, inset): this is because the distance between responses was always more or less equal to the distance between the corresponding stimulus waveforms (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We note that this low value was not due to variability in the response of single afferents, as the population responses obtained by linearly summating the individual neural responses also displayed invariance scores near zero (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, inset). We further note that computing invariance scores using only responses to subsets of chirps (i.e. those computed using only same type '++/-\u00a0-'\u00a0or opposite type '+-'\u00a0chirp combinations) resulted in low values as well (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, blue). Thus, we conclude that single peripheral afferent responses were minimally phase invariant as these neurons faithfully encoded the different patterns of sensory input resulting from the same chirp occurring at different phases within the beat cycle."

To do so, we performed simultaneous recordings from afferent pairs, as well as recombined recorded activities from single afferents, in response to the patterns of sensory input resulting from the same chirp occurring at different phases within the beat cycle used above for single afferents. Similar results were seen when considering simultaneously recorded or recombined pairs: afferent activities were always more similar after chirp onset as afferent spiking activities were more synchronized either through excitation or inhibition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, blue curves compare Firing Rate 1 to Firing Rate 2). We thus quantified similarity by computing a time varying correlation coefficient between spike trains at short timescales (see Methods). Our results show that correlation transiently increased following chirp onset (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, purple curves). Importantly, the time course of the correlation coefficient was similar for all stimulus waveforms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), as quantified by a large invariance score (mean: 0.53 \u00b1 0.02; max: 0.67; min: 0.35; population: 0.61) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, inset &amp; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) that was not significantly different for either simultaneously recorded (0.51 \u00b1 0.02) or recombined (0.53 \u00b1 0.03) afferent activities (t-test, p=0.4). These high invariance scores were obtained because the distance between the time-varying correlation coefficient was always less than that between the corresponding stimulus waveforms (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar results were observed when systematically varying the time scale at which correlations were computed up to \u223c60 ms (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To investigate whether the electrosensory system actually uses the fact that correlated afferent activity provides a phase invariant representation of natural communication signals, we recorded from hindbrain ELL pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These receive synaptic input from afferents and furthermore constitute the sole output neurons of the ELL (<a href=\"#bib46\">Maler, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Maler et al., 1981</a>). Pyramidal neurons can be classified as either ON or OFF-type based on whether they respond to increases in stimulus amplitude through increases or decreases in firing rate, respectively (<a href=\"#bib74\">Saunders and Bastian, 1984</a>) (see [<a href=\"#bib22\">Clarke et al., 2015b</a>] for review). Previous results have shown that pyramidal neurons respond to correlated afferent activity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berman and Maler, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Middleton et al., 2009</a>). Thus, our working hypothesis is that, if single ON and OFF-type ELL pyramidal neurons actually decode increases in correlated afferent activity in response to natural communication stimuli, then they should: 1) display significantly more phase invariance than single afferents and 2) respond in a complementary fashion to different waveform subsets. Specifically, ON and OFF-type pyramidal neurons should respond more similarly with excitation and inhibition to the stimulus waveforms giving rise to synchronized excitation (i.e. '+ chirps') and inhibition (i.e. '- chirps') in afferents, respectively."

The complementarity of responses was furthermore reflected by the fact that the population responses of ON and OFF cells were negatively correlated during responses to all waveforms (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consequently, the average tuning curves of ON and OFF-type cells were mirror images of one another (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Consistent with our predictions, ELL pyramidal neurons were significantly more phase invariant than single afferents (ELL ON; mean: 0.19 \u00b1 0.01; max: 0.32; min: 0.03; population: 0.19; ELL OFF; mean: 0.16 \u00b1 0.01; max: 0.21; min: 0.07; population: 0.16) (ANOVA with Bonferroni correction, p&lt;0.01) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>).

We hypothesized that the increased phase invariance is primarily due to the fact that ON cells respond similarly with excitation to '+\u00a0chirps' and with inhibition to '-\u00a0chirps' while OFF cells instead respond similarly with inhibition to '+\u00a0chirps' and with excitation to '-\u00a0chirps'. These opposite responses to different subsets of chirp stimulus waveforms should limit phase invariance as the distances between the evoked responses will then be larger. To test this hypothesis, we computed the invariance score only for same-type chirps combinations (i.e. '++/-\u00a0-') as well as for opposite-type chirps combinations (i.e. '+-'). We found that invariance scores computed for same-type chirp combinations were significantly larger than those computed for opposite-type chirp combinations for both ON (ANOVA; p&lt;0.01) and OFF-type (ANOVA; p&lt;0.018) pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Further, average invariance score values computed for opposite-type chirp combinations in ON (0.15 \u00b1 0.02) and OFF-type (0.11 \u00b1 0.01) ELL pyramidal cells were similar to those obtained for single afferents (0.16 \u00b1 0.002) (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2F</a>). These results thus confirm our hypothesis that the increased phase invariance of ELL pyramidal cells is due to the fact that they respond more similarly to '+ chirps' and '- chirps' than single afferents. However, phase invariance in ELL is limited by the fact that ON and OFF-type pyramidal cells both respond in opposite fashion to different subsets of chirp stimulus waveforms (i.e. '+\u00a0chirps' and '-\u00a0chirps')."

Recordings from ELL pyramidal neurons revealed that these responded primarily through excitation to one half of the input patterns resulting from the same chirp occurring at different phases within the beat cycle and through inhibition to the other half, which limits phase invariance. Perhaps the simplest way to increase phase invariance is to sum the activities of ON and OFF cells. These responses should then be more similar and thus increase phase invariance. To test this hypothesis, we recorded from midbrain TS neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Anatomical studies have shown that neurons within the midbrain TS receive only direct excitatory synaptic input from multiple ON and OFF-type ELL pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carr and Maler, 1985</a>), as reflected by their response properties (<a href=\"#bib53\">McGillivray et al., 2012</a>). We thus hypothesized that single TS neurons should display significantly higher phase invariance than ELL neurons on average by responding primarily with excitation to most if not all patterns of stimulation input resulting from the same chirp occurring at different phases within the beat cycle."

The response similarity was reflected in the population-averaged tuning curves (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) as well as in the phase invariance score (mean: 0.26 \u00b1 0.02; max: 0.49; min: 0.16; population: 0.4) that was significantly higher than that of ELL neurons (ANOVA with Bonferroni correction, p&lt;0.01) when considering all waveforms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This is because the distance between responses is considerably lower than the distance between the corresponding stimulus waveforms (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Phase invariance score values obtained for the TS neuron population (0.4) furthermore approached those observed for correlated peripheral afferent activity (0.53). We note that the population-averaged response of TS neurons decreased for '-\u00a0chirps' (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>): this is because some TS neurons responded similarly to ELL ON-type pyramidal cells and were thus inhibited by '-\u00a0chirps'. However, TS neurons with larger phase invariance scores (N=13) were excited by all chirp waveforms as quantified by positive responses for all chirp waveforms (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Further, computing phase invariance scores over either same type ('++/-\u00a0-') or opposite type ('+-') chirp combinations led to values that were not significantly different from\u00a0one another (++/-\u00a0-: 0.24 \u00b1 0.02; +-: 0.28 \u00b1 0.02) (ANOVA; F = 1.3, p=0.28) and that were furthermore similar to those obtained using all waveforms (0.26 \u00b1 0.02). This confirms our hypothesis that TS neurons are, on average, more phase invariant than ELL pyramidal cells because a significant fraction (\u223c50%) responds with excitation to both '+ chirps' and '- chirps'. The simplest explanation for this observation is that these neurons receive excitatory input from ELL ON and OFF-type pyramidal cells. This point is discussed further below."

To answer this important question, we recorded the animal\u2019s behavioral responses to patterns of stimulation resulting from the same chirp occurring at different phases within the beat cycle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) using a previously established behavioral paradigm (<a href=\"#bib94\">Zupanc et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hup\u00e9 et al., 2008</a>) (see thods) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Specifically, we used the echo response in which an animal will reliably respond to a communication signal from a conspecific with a communication signal of its own (<a href=\"#bib94\">Zupanc et al., 2006</a>). These occur during aggressive interactions between two conspecifics under natural conditions (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hup\u00e9 et al., 2008</a>). If our hypothesis is true, then we expect that all the presented waveforms will elicit similar behavioral responses. Confirming our hypothesis, the elicited behavioral responses were very similar (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Consequently, the response tuning was effectively independent of beat phase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, top). Importantly, other measures such as response latency and rate of occurrence also did not depend on beat phase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, bottom). Invariance values computed from behavioral responses were near unity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). This is because the distance between responses is considerably lower than the distance between the corresponding stimulus waveforms (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We conclude that the organism perceives the different patterns of stimulation input resulting from the same chirp occurring at different phases within the beat cycle in a similar fashion and thus displays perceptual phase invariance<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> ."

We found that the responses of single peripheral afferents displayed minimal phase invariance, as these neurons faithfully encoded all the different waveforms resulting from the same chirp stimulus occurring at different phases within the beat cycle. In contrast, simultaneous recordings from afferent pairs revealed that these waveforms all gave rise to similar increases in correlated activity. ON and OFF-type ELL neurons displayed significantly higher phase invariance than single peripheral afferents. Indeed, both\u00a0the ON\u00a0and\u00a0OFF-type subpopulations showed the greatest degree of phase invariance to waveforms giving rise to either\u00a0excitation or\u00a0inhibition\u00a0in afferents. Responses from both subpopulations are most likely combined in the midbrain TS, thereby giving rise to a more phase invariant representation that, at the population level, approached that seen for correlated afferent activity. Finally, we showed that weakly electric fish displayed similar behavioral responses to stimulus waveforms generated by applying an identity-preserving transformation, which strongly suggests that the globally invariant representation observed in midbrain constitutes a neural correlate of perception. Our results thus reveal generic mechanisms that mediate the emergence and refinement of a neural representation that is invariant to the different patterns of stimulation input resulting from the same chirp occurring at different phases within the beat cycle."

These most likely constitute a neural correlate of perception. Our electrophysiological and behavioral results thus support our initial hypothesis that the identity of a given chirp is determined by frequency increase and duration but not the phase of the beat at which it occurs at."

Such refinement is likely to occur in the nucleus electrosensorius, a diencephalic brain structure that receives direct input from TS (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carr et al., 1981</a>), and likely involves integrating the activities of multiple TS neurons. The fact that the invariance score of the TS neuron population was on average higher than that of single neurons supports the latter statement. Importantly, we note here that the TS in weakly electric fish consists of 11 layers with roughly 50 cell types (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carr and Maler, 1985</a>). Previous electrophysiological studies have revealed that TS neurons are highly heterogeneous and can be roughly classified in two groups: 'dense' neurons that respond to stimuli in a manner that is strongly reminiscent of that displayed by ELL pyramidal neurons; and 'sparse' neurons that respond selectively to a given class of natural electrosensory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib86\">Vonderschen and Chacron, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Sproule et al., 2015</a>).

It is likely that these are members of the sparse group as they responded selectively to communication stimuli rather than the underlying beat. A previous study has shown that neurons with similar response profiles receive balanced excitatory input from ON and OFF-type pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</a>) and, as such, most likely correspond to previously described 'ON-OFF' neurons that respond to both increases and decreases in the stimulus (<a href=\"#bib64\">Partridge et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Rose and Call, 1993</a>). We, however, note that these neurons correspond to a few if not a single cell type within TS (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carr et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carr and Maler, 1985</a>), as partially reflected by the broad distribution of phase invariance scores observed in the current study in TS neurons. In fact, confirming previous results (<a href=\"#bib86\">Vonderschen and Chacron, 2011</a>), a significant fraction of TS neurons displayed low-phase invariance scores comparable to those seen in ELL, indicating that they responded differentially (i.e. non-invariantly) to the different waveforms resulting from a given chirp occurring at different phases within the cycle of a beat. Interestingly, it was shown recently that both dense and sparse TS neurons project to higher brain areas (<a href=\"#bib81\">Sproule et al., 2015</a>), indicating that these actually receive parallel sources of information including those transmitted by both phase invariant and non-phase invariant TS neurons. Phase invariant TS neurons would then give information that a chirp has occurred while non-phase invariant TS neurons would instead transmit contextual information about this chirp. While our behavioral results do not demonstrate whether the animal can actually perceive information transmitted by non-phase invariant TS neurons, it is likely that this information is behaviorally relevant."

Thus, we predict that the organism will perceive communication signals whose attributes other than beat phase differ. We further hypothesize that, in more central brain areas, neural representations become more selective to chirp identity while at the same time becoming more tolerant to changes in waveform resulting from a given chirp occurring at different phases during the beat cycle. Specifically, we predict that peripheral afferents will faithfully encode the different waveforms associated with changes in a given feature irrespective of behavioral relevance. However, when moving more centrally from receptors to midbrain, neural responses should become more selective when varying chirp identity. If true, it will then be very interesting to understand the mechanisms by which neurons become selective to given stimulus attributes yet tolerant to others. While a previous study has shown that some TS neurons could respond differentially to communication signals with different frequency increases (<a href=\"#bib86\">Vonderschen and Chacron, 2011</a>), the tuning properties of TS neurons to the behaviorally relevant features of natural communication stimuli have not been systematically investigated to date and should be the focus of future studies."

Thus, the discovered computations for generating and refining phase invariance uncovered in the electrosensory system that involve decoding correlated activity through ON and OFF-type neurons and their subsequent combination are also likely to be applicable. This is particularly the case in the primary visual cortex. Indeed, while simple cells respond selectively (<a href=\"#bib60\">Movshon, 1975</a>), complex cells instead display responses that are invariant to the spatial phase of a drifting grating (<a href=\"#bib61\">Movshon et al., 1978</a>).

All responses were normalized prior to computing the distance metric. We note that, according to equation [3], the distance between responses to two different stimulus waveforms is actually normalized by the distance between the stimulus waveforms themselves. Thus, a neuron whose response faithfully encodes the detailed timecourse of the different chirp waveforms will not be considered invariant according to our definition. Invariance scores were computed for each individual cell and subsequently averaged across the respective populations. Some analyses were performed on TS neurons (N = 13) whose phase invariance score was greater than 0.25, which was chosen as the mean plus one standard deviation from our ELL data. We computed phase invariance for correlated activity as described above except that we used the timecourse of the varying correlation coefficient as an input. Alternatively, to test that the low values obtained for receptor afferents were not due to variability, we also computed phase invariance scores for these by first averaging responses across the population."

The EOD was measured between electrodes placed near the head and tail, amplified (model 1700 amplifier, A-M systems), digitized at 10 kHz sampling rate using CED 1401plus hardware and Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, E1 and E2), and stored on a computer hard disc for offline analysis. To analyze the chirp echo response, we first extracted the time varying EOD frequency of each fish tested. The fish\u2019s EOD was recorded and the instantaneous EOD frequency was computed from the inverse of the timing difference between successive zero crossings. To measure echo responses to small chirp stimuli delivered at different beat phases, we initially habituated the animal to a 4\u2009Hz beat stimulus lasting 60 s in order to minimize the probability of chirp responses being elicited by the beat alone: the chirp rate during a 200 ms window preceding stimulus chirp onset was null (0 \u00b1 0\u2009Hz). We then randomly interspersed chirp stimuli at variable intervals (15 ms \u00b1 3 ms) and the recording was started 200 ms before chirp onset. In total, for each fish, we played 40 chirp stimuli such that each chirp phase was presented five times. Echo response chirps occurring during a 1\u2009s window after stimulus chirp onset were identified as increases in the animal\u2019s own EOD frequency that exceeded 30\u2009Hz and were segregated into small (type II) and big (type I) chirps as done previously (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bastian et al., 2001</a>). Based on this criterion, almost all echo response chirps were classified as type II (98.7%) while the rest were classified as type I (1.3%). All echo response chirps were included in the analysis. The time of occurrence of echo response chirps was defined as the time at which the EOD frequency excursion was maximal. The echo response chirp rate <i>CR<sub>chirp</sub></i> was computed as the number of echo response chirps during a time window of 1\u2009s following the stimulus chirp onset since previous studies have shown that the majority of responses occur during this time window (<a href=\"#bib94\">Zupanc et al., 2006</a>). The echo response latency was determined as the timing of the first echo response chirp after chirp stimulus onset. Since the probability of eliciting an echo response chirp was low in general, we averaged the responses to a particular chirp phase obtained from all fish tested to build peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs). PSTHs for all single chirp phases were smoothed using a 1\u2009s long boxcar filter. Behavioral responses were quantified as log(<i>CR<sub>chirp</sub>/CR<sub>beat</sub></i>), where <i>CR<sub>beat\u00a0</sub></i>is the average echo response chirp rate during the beat between 1 and 2 s following stimulus chirp onset, where relatively fewer echo responses tend to occur (<a href=\"#bib94\">Zupanc et al., 2006</a>). Invariance scores for behavior were computed as described above for neural responses except that we used the behavioral PSTHs as responses. Error bars were estimated using a sequential bootstrapping method (<a href=\"#bib30\">Efron, 1979</a>) with block size 27."

The paper very clearly demonstrates that the \"transient\" response produced by communication chirp is coded at the level of the afferents with positive (an increase in rate) and negative signals (a decrease in rate) depending on the phase of the chirp relative to the amplitude beat produced by the interfering EOD of the two fishes. That afferent response is therefore phase sensitive. However, the correlated activity of the afferents shows phase invariance (as the rates decrease in synchrony or increase in synchrony). A detector of such correlated activity would be phase invariant. These computations appear to take place in the \"next\" two levels of neural processing. First at the level of the ELL, ON and OFF cells show increased invariance for all + chirps and -chirps respectively (+ and \u2013 chirps are defined according to the phase of the beat). Then at the level of TS, neurons combine information of ON and OFF cells to generate positive responses to most chirps irrespective of phase. Thus phase invariance is achieved simply by first a weighted sum of afferent responses into two groups and then a sum of these two responses. This computation appears to be similar (both in spirit and connectivity) to the \"hierarchical models\" that have been proposed for describing complex cells in V1 (see Martinez and Alonso, 2003). It may not be exactly a \"correlator\" detector or a more general neural computation for other forms of invariance but this is now appropriately discussed."

The paper very clearly demonstrates that the \"transient\" response produced by communication chirp is coded at the level of the afferents with positive (an increase in rate) and negative signals (a decrease in rate) depending on the phase of the chirp relative to the amplitude beat produced by the interfering EOD of the two fishes. That afferent response is therefore phase sensitive. However, the correlated activity of the afferents shows phase invariance (as the rates decrease in synchrony or increase in synchrony). A detector of such correlated activity would be phase invariant. These computations appear to take place in the \"next\" two levels of neural processing. First at the level of the ELL, ON and OFF cells show increased invariance for all + chirps and -chirps respectively (+ and \u2013 chirps are defined according to the phase of the beat). Then at the level of TS, neurons combine information of ON and OFF cells to generate positive responses to most chirps irrespective of phase. Thus phase invariance is achieved simply by first a weighted sum of afferent responses into two groups and then a sum of these two responses. This computation appears to be similar (both in spirit and connectivity) to the \"hierarchical models\" that have been proposed for describing complex cells in V1 (see Martinez and Alonso, 2003). It may not be exactly a \"correlator\" detector or a more general neural computation for other forms of invariance but this is now appropriately discussed.</i>"

It is not clear how their model/conclusions fit with the data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4E</a>. It is easy to imagine how appropriate weighting of inputs from one stage of processing could give rise to the increased invariance observed at the next stage, and this is an important finding. However, the way in which this happens does not seem as simple as the narrative presented: (<a href=\"#bib31\"><sup>29</sup></a>) ELL ON-cells being invariant to +chirps but not -chirps; (<a href=\"#bib66\"><sup>65</sup></a>) ELL OFF-cells being invariant to - chirps but not + chirps; and (<a href=\"#bib6\"><sup>6</sup></a>) TS cells integrating ON- and OFF-cell inputs to establish global chirp invariance. The data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4E</a> and the accompanying descriptions in the text do not show this convincingly. The authors either need to show that the +chirp and -chirp differences in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> are significant (perhaps with a 2-way ANOVA), or present their conclusions in such a way that they do not depend on their being a difference here. Similarly, they need to show that the +chirp and -chirp differences in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> are not significant, or present their conclusions in such a way that they do not depend on their being no difference here.</i>"
