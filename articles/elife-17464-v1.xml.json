                    "text": "Forgetting of recent fear memory is promoted by treatment with memantine (MEM), which increases hippocampal neurogenesis. The approaches for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using rodent models have focused on the extinction and reconsolidation of recent, but not remote, memories. Here we show that, following prolonged re-exposure to the conditioning context, enhancers of hippocampal neurogenesis, including MEM, promote forgetting of remote contextual fear memory. However, these interventions are ineffective following shorter re-exposures. Importantly, we find that long, but not short re-exposures activate gene expression in the hippocampus and induce hippocampus-dependent reconsolidation of remote contextual fear memory. Furthermore, remote memory retrieval becomes hippocampus-dependent after the long-time recall, suggesting that remote fear memory returns to a hippocampus dependent state after the long-time recall, thereby allowing enhanced forgetting by increased hippocampal neurogenesis. Forgetting of traumatic memory may contribute to the development of PTSD treatment."

The approaches for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using rodent models have focused on the extinction and reconsolidation of recent, but not remote, memories. Here we show that, following prolonged re-exposure to the conditioning context, enhancers of hippocampal neurogenesis, including MEM, promote forgetting of remote contextual fear memory. However, these interventions are ineffective following shorter re-exposures. Importantly, we find that long, but not short re-exposures activate gene expression in the hippocampus and induce hippocampus-dependent reconsolidation of remote contextual fear memory. Furthermore, remote memory retrieval becomes hippocampus-dependent after the long-time recall, suggesting that remote fear memory returns to a hippocampus dependent state after the long-time recall, thereby allowing enhanced forgetting by increased hippocampal neurogenesis. Forgetting of traumatic memory may contribute to the development of PTSD treatment."

In experimental animals PTSD may be modeled using Pavlovian fear conditioning. Pavlovian fear conditioning generates fear memory, reflecting an association between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US). This CS-US association is stabilized and becomes a long-term memory (LTM) through gene expression dependent consolidation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Flexner et al., 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Davis and Squire, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Silva et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">McGaugh, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abel et al., 2001</a>)."

First, repeated and/or prolonged re-exposure to the CS induces extinction. This is an inhibitory learning process that reduces fear while preserving the original fear memory (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pavlov, 1927</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rescorla, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Myers and Davis, 2002</a>). Second, retrieval destabilizes a fear memory, necessitating protein synthesis restabilization (or reconsolidation). Accordingly, targeting protein synthesis following retrieval may prevent reconsolidation and weaken or even erase fear memories (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nader et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Debiec et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kida et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Suzuki et al., 2004</a>). Third, forgetting processes may weaken established fear memories (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akers et al., 2014</a>). While interventions to treat PTSD have focused on extinction and reconsolidation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bentz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mueller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Litz et al., 2012</a>), interventions that promote forgetting may represent an alternative approach for modifying traumatic memories."

                        "text": "In this regard, recently it has been shown that neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus regulates forgetting of hippocampus-dependent memories. Increasing hippocampal neurogenesis following training accelerated forgetting, whereas reducing hippocampal neurogenesis following training stabilized or strengthened existing hippocampus-dependent memories (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akers et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Epp et al., 2016</a>). Here we first replicate these findings and show that post-training elevation of hippocampal neurogenesis via memantine (MEM), which is a non-competitive inhibitor of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bormann, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Seif el Nasr et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">M\u00fcller et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Danysz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Volbracht et al., 2006</a>),\u00a0can weaken contextual fear memories. As contextual fear memories age, they become less dependent upon the hippocampus for their expression (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim and Fanselow, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Anagnostaras et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Frankland and Bomtempi, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wiltgen et al., 2006</a>). Consistent with this, MEM treatment at remote time points failed to induce forgetting of contextual fear memories. However, reminders treatments that re-engage the hippocampus render contextual fear memories susceptible again to MEM-induced forgetting. As one of the major challenges in PTSD is finding treatments to weaken traumatic memories for events in the remote past although most approaches to weaken or erase fear memory target reconsolidation and extinction of the recent, but not remote, memory (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nader et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Monfils et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kaplan and Moore, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Xue et al., 2012</a>),\u00a0these findings suggest targeting forgetting processes as a potentially viable alternative or adjunct to extinction and reconsolidation based approaches."

Mice were trained with a single foot shock (0.4 mA, Training), and 24\u2009hrs later tested (Test 1). Twenty-four hrs after the Test 1, the mice received systemic injections of MEM (50 mg/kg body weight (bw)) or vehicle (VEH) once a week for four weeks (MEM-4 or VEH group). Another group received an injection of MEM only 24\u2009hr after Test 1 (MEM-1 group). Contextual fear memory was assessed again four weeks after initial training (Test 2). All groups displayed comparable and high freezing response levels during Test 1. In contrast, the MEM-1 and -4 groups showed reduced freezing compared to the VEH group in Test 2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), although this reduction was only statistically significant in the MEM-4 group.

Conversely, preventing MEM-associated increases in hippocampal neurogenesis blocks MEM-induced forgetting of contextual fear memory (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akers et al., 2014</a>). We next examined the relationship between forgetting of contextual fear memory and increased hippocampal neurogenesis after MEM treatments. For this purpose, we examined the impact of different MEM doses on neurogenesis and forgetting. We performed a similar experiment to that shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> except mice were treated with low (25 mg/kg bw) or high (50 mg/kg bw) doses of MEM or VEH. Mice also received systemic injections of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg bw) to label proliferating cells, at two days after each MEM or VEH treatment, and then the number of BrdU-positive cells was quantified 24\u2009hr after Test 2 by using immunohistochemistry. We found that MEM enhanced forgetting and hippocampal neurogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. The MEM-50 group showed significantly less freezing at Test 2, and significantly increased BrdU-positive cells compared to the VEH group (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The MEM-25 group showed intermediate levels of freezing and BrdU-positive cells compared to VEH and MEM-50 groups (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a>). We then performed correlational analyses by comparing the number of BrdU-positive cells with reductions in freezing scores (by subtracting freezing levels of Test 1 from Test 2) for the MEM-25 group since this group that showed mid-levels of both forgetting and neurogenesis. We found that there was a significant negative correlation between forgetting and neurogenesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These results indicated that mice showing more neurogenesis also had more forgetting, and support the idea that MEM enhances forgetting through the increase in hippocampal neurogenesis."

Therefore, MEM-induced forgetting should be limited to brain regions like the hippocampus that are remodeled with the addition of new neurons (<a href=\"#bib19\">Frankland et al., 2013</a>). To address this, we next trained mice in aversively-motivated tasks that are hippocampus-dependent and -independent, respectively. First, we used an inhibitory avoidance tasks that depends upon the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lorenzini et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). Twenty-four hours after training with a 0.1 mA foot shock, mice were treated with MEM for four weeks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and then crossover latency was assessed (Test). The MEM group showed significantly shorter crossover latencies than the VEH group (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), indicating that MEM enhanced forgetting of inhibitory avoidance memory. We next used cued fear conditioning tasks that can generate an amygdala-dependent fear memory (<a href=\"#bib48\">Phillips and LeDoux, 1992</a>). Mice were presented a tone that co-terminated with a 0.4 mA foot shock in the training context (Training). Mice were assessed for their freezing responses to the tone in a different chamber at 24\u2009hr (Test 1) and four weeks (Test 2) after the training. As in previous experiments, after Test 1 mice received MEM or VEH for four weeks. In contrast to the results shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, the MEM group showed similar levels of freezing to the tone with the VEH group in both Test 1 and Test 2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), indicating that MEM failed to promote forgetting of cued (amygdala-dependent) fear memory. These results are consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akers et al., 2014</a>),\u00a0and suggested that MEM promotes forgetting of only hippocampus-dependent fear memory."

However, previously we showed that reminders (e.g., context re-exposure) may render memories hippocampus-dependent again and make them vulnerable again to amnestic treatments that block reconsolidation (e.g., protein synthesis blockade) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Suzuki et al., 2004</a>). Using the same logic here we ask whether reminders (i.e., context re-exposure) may make remote contextual fear memories susceptible to MEM-induced forgetting. In our previous reconsolidation experiment we found that long (10\u2009min) but not short (3\u2009min) re-exposures to the context were effective, and so here we used these long and brief reminders. Mice were trained as previously, and then re-exposed to the context for 3 or 10\u2009min eight weeks later (re-exposure). Following re-exposure, MEM treatment was initiated and memory tested four weeks later (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). All groups showed comparable levels of freezing during the re-exposure (3 or 10\u2009min). Four weeks later, the MEM group with 3\u2009min re-exposure showed comparable freezing with the VEH group in the test. In contrast, the MEM group with 10\u2009min re-exposure showed significantly less freezing than the other groups (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These results indicated re-exposure to the context for 10\u2009min eight weeks after initial training renders the context memory sensitive to MEM-induced forgetting."

Therefore, we next examined the effects of exercise on forgetting of remote contextual fear memory. We performed a similar experiment as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> except that the\u00a0mice were given continuous access to a running wheel in their home cage (Run) or housed under sedentary conditions (No-Run) for four weeks after re-exposure to the context for 0, 3, or 10\u2009min (re-exposure). Consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3A</a>), No-Run group and Run group without re-exposure did not weaken remote contextual fear memory. However, running for four weeks following long (10\u2009min) but not brief (3\u2009min) context re-exposure did lead to forgetting (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Reconsolidation of contextual fear memory depends on the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nader et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Debiec et al., 2002</a>),\u00a0and forgetting is associated with increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Therefore, we first evaluated whether extended context re-exposure make remote contextual fear memories freshly dependent on the hippocampus. To do this, we used a reconsolidation approach and asked whether a reminder renders a remote contextual fear memory sensitive to protein synthesis blockade. In this experiment, mice were trained and then re-exposed to the context 24\u2009hr later for 3\u2009min. Immediately following this re-exposure mice received a micro-infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (ANI) or VEH into the dorsal hippocampus, and 24\u2009hr later mice were assessed for freezing (Test). As we have previously observed (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kida et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Frankland et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Suzuki et al., 2008</a>),\u00a0ANI group exhibited reduced freezing during the subsequent test (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting that protein synthesis is necessary for re-stabilization of fear memories following reminders. In a second experiment, mice were re-exposed to the context for 3\u2009min or 10\u2009min four weeks after training. In this case, ANI-infusions into the dorsal hippocampus impaired subsequent memory only following the longer reminder (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>). These results indicated that long reminders induce hippocampal gene expression-dependent reconsolidation of remote fear memory."

In contrast, retrieval of remote contextual fear memory induces <i>c-fos</i> expression in the ACC, but not in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib16\">Frankland et al., 2004</a>). Therefore, the retrieval of remote memory appears not to reactivate the hippocampus. However, it is important to note that, in this previous study, contextual fear memory was retrieved by re-exposure to the context for only 3\u2009min, which corresponds to our brief context reminder treatment used in the current study. It is possible that longer context reminders at remote time-points will induce c-fos expression in the hippocampus, a finding that would be consistent with our observation that longer context reminders render remote contextual fear memories sensitive to reconsolidation blockade by protein synthesis inhibition."

To directly address this possibility, we examined the effects of hippocampal inactivation on the retrieval of remote memory after long-time retrieval. Mice were re-exposed to the context for 10\u2009min, four weeks after the training (re-exposure). Twenty-four hr later, mice received a micro-infusion of the sodium channel blocker lidocaine (LIDO) or VEH into the hippocampus, and 10\u2009min later, freezing was assessed (Test 1, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Mice were assessed for freezing again 24\u2009hr after Test 1 (Test 2, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) in a drug-free state. LIDO-induced inactivation of the hippocampus impaired retrieval. Importantly, when retested drug-free, LIDO group exhibited comparable retrieval with VEH group (Test 2). These results suggest that the retrieval of remote memory becomes dependent on the hippocampus following the long re-exposure intervention, supporting our hypothesis that remote contextual fear memory returns to a hippocampus-dependent state with sufficient reminding."

We also showed that the enhanced forgetting induced by MEM correlated with increases in hippocampal neurogenesis. However, MEM failed to promote forgetting of amygdala-dependent fear memory. Furthermore, in contrast to recent memory, MEM had no impact on remote fear memory that was hippocampus-independent (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dudai, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Squire and Bayley, 2007</a>).

Accordingly, using the same approach here, we found that MEM treatment following 10\u2009min re-exposure enhanced forgetting of remote contextual fear memory. In addition, forgetting of remote contextual fear memory was promoted by exercise using a running wheel, another hippocampal neurogenesis enhancer (<a href=\"#bib62\">van Praag et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akers et al., 2014</a>)\u00a0following long (but not short) context re-exposures. It is important to note that this 10\u2009min re-exposure did not appear to trigger the\u00a0extinction of remote contextual fear memory for a number of reasons. First, decreased freezing responses were observed only when mice were treated with hippocampal neurogenesis enhancers (MEM or running). This suggests that this decrease of freezing scores depends on hippocampal neurogenesis-induced forgetting rather than extinction. Second, reconsolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory require longer re-exposure when memory becomes older or stronger, suggesting that 10\u2009min re-exposure to the context is sufficient for reconsolidation but insufficient for extinction when memory is remote (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#bib59\">Suzuki et al 2004</a>,\u00a0data not shown). Third, reconsolidation and extinction show contrasting biochemical signatures in the hippocampus (c-fos expression is observed in the hippocampus when memory is reconsolidated, but not extinguished) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mamiya et al., 2009</a>). Consistently, 10\u2009min re-exposure induces hippocampal c-fos expression and enables disrupt fear memory by protein synthesis inhibition, suggesting that this longer re-exposure induces reconsolidation but not extinction. Taken together, our findings suggest that forgetting of remote contextual fear memory is enhanced by the increase in hippocampal neurogenesis only after extended behavioral 'reminders'."

Our findings support our hypothesis as follows: (1) Hippocampus-dependent reconsolidation of remote memory is induced following the long, but not short context re-exposures, suggesting that extended 'reminders' recruit the hippocampus to help regulate remote memory. (2) The long, but not short context re-exposure at remote time points induces the expression of c-fos in the hippocampus, indicating that the prolonged retrieval of remote memory reactivates the hippocampus at the molecular and cellular levels. (3) The retrieval of remote memory is hippocampus-dependent when the memory is recalled 24\u2009hr after these reminder treatments. Additionally, these findings suggest that the activation of hippocampus by longer context re-exposures open a window both to induce hippocampus-dependent reconsolidation and hippocampal neurogenesis-dependent forgetting by returning remote memory to a hippocampus-dependent state."

In agreement with these studies, Frankland et al. showed that the expression of immediate early genes (<i>c-fos, Zif 268</i>) was induced when recent contextual fear memory was retrieved, while this expression was not observed when remote memory was retrieved, suggesting that the hippocampus is reactivated only when recent memory is retrieved (<a href=\"#bib16\">Frankland et al., 2004</a>). However, our results indicated that the expression of c-fos in the hippocampus was induced only at remote time points following extended (but not brief) context re-exposure, in agreement with <a href=\"#bib16\">Frankland et al.

However, longer context re-exposures (10\u2009min) enabled the induction of reconsolidation of remote memory (<a href=\"#bib59\">Suzuki et al., 2004</a>). Furthermore, we found that the reconsolidation of remote memory required reactivation of the hippocampus, reflected by activated gene expression. Therefore, our observations suggest that reactivation of the hippocampus following extended 'reminders' may contribute to updating remote memory in order to add new information to the original remote memory.

During the training session, each mouse was allowed to habituate to the light compartment for 30 s, and the guillotine door was raised to allow access to the dark compartment. Latency to enter into the dark compartment was considered as a measure of acquisition. Immediately after the mouse entered the dark compartment, the guillotine door was closed. After 5 s, a foot shock (0.1 mA) was delivered for a total period of 2 s. Memory was assessed four weeks later as the crossover latency for the mouse to enter into the dark compartment when returned to the light compartment, as during the training period."

In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, we observed decreased freezing responses at the Test 4 weeks after the re-exposure to the context for 10 min only when mice were treated with MEM or running. In contrast, untreated mice did not show reduced freezing responses, suggesting that this decrease of freezing scores depends on increased hippocampal neurogenesis, but not due to memory extinction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). In addition, our previous studies have suggested that the induction of reconsolidation and extinction requires longer duration of re-exposure to the context when memory becomes older or stronger, suggesting that 10 min re-exposure to the context is sufficient to induce reconsolidation but fails to induce extinction when memory is remote (Suzuki et al. 2004, data not shown). Consistently, reconsolidation, but not extinction, was observed following 10 min re-exposure when memory is remote (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Furthermore, our previous study (Mamiya et al., 2009) showed that c-fos expression is observed in the hippocampus when memory is reconsolidated in response to the context for 3 min, while this c-fos expression is not observed when memory is extinguished in response to the context for 30 min, indicating that reconsolidation and extinction shows contrasting biochemical signatures in the hippocampus. Thus, c-fos expression in the hippocampus is thought to be a biochemical marker of reconsolidation. Similarly, in this manuscript, c-fos expression was observed when remote memory is reconsolidated in response to 10 min re-exposure, suggesting that this longer re-exposure induces reconsolidation but not extinction. We believe that these 3 lines of evidence suggest that longer re-exposure to the context (for 10min) does not contribute to memory extinction, but helps to make the memory hippocampus-dependent again and therefore freshly vulnerable to the effects of neurogenesis-induced forgetting. According to the suggestions from review, we revised text in the Discussion (second paragraph)."

As suggested, this may be due to remaining fear memory that depends on brain regions other than hippocampus. However, previous studies have shown that similar low levels of freezing responses are observed when consolidation or reconsolidation of fear memory is disrupted by amnestic drugs or gene manipulations and when fear memory is extinguished. Therefore, in this manuscript, we concluded that significant forgetting was observed following the treatments with MEM or running, but that the memory is not completely erased. Nonetheless, we found that c-fos expression is not induced in the ACC and hippocampus of mice received MEM treatments after the retrieval test compared to control groups (CS-US group without MEM treatments and no CS group, data not shown), suggesting that the forgetting observed is quite profound (above baseline levels of freezing, but no activation of ACC by retrieval at remote time point).
