ATP synthases operate by a rotary catalytic mechanism where proton translocation through the membrane-inserted F<sub>0</sub> region is coupled to ATP synthesis in the catalytic F<sub>1</sub> region via rotation of a central rotor subcomplex. We report here single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of the bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase. Combining cryo-EM data with bioinformatic analysis allowed us to determine the fold of the a subunit, suggesting a proton translocation path through the F<sub>0</sub> region that involves both the a and b subunits. 3D classification of images revealed seven distinct states of the enzyme that show different modes of bending and twisting in the intact ATP synthase. Rotational fluctuations of the c<sub>8</sub>-ring within the F<sub>0</sub> region support a Brownian ratchet mechanism for proton-translocation driven rotation in ATP synthases."
