                    "text": "Motor neurons of the crustacean cardiac ganglion generate virtually identical, synchronized output despite the fact that each neuron uses distinct conductance magnitudes. As a result of this variability, manipulations that target ionic conductances have distinct effects on neurons within the same ganglion, disrupting synchronized motor neuron output that is necessary for proper cardiac function. We hypothesized that robustness in network output is accomplished via plasticity that counters such destabilizing influences. By blocking high-threshold K<sup>+</sup> conductances in motor neurons within the ongoing cardiac network, we discovered that compensation both resynchronized the network and helped restore excitability. Using model findings to guide experimentation, we determined that compensatory increases of both G<sub>A</sub> and electrical coupling restored function in the network. This is one of the first direct demonstrations of the physiological regulation of coupling conductance in a compensatory context, and of synergistic plasticity across cell- and network-level mechanisms in the restoration of output."

As a result of this variability, manipulations that target ionic conductances have distinct effects on neurons within the same ganglion, disrupting synchronized motor neuron output that is necessary for proper cardiac function. We hypothesized that robustness in network output is accomplished via plasticity that counters such destabilizing influences. By blocking high-threshold K<sup>+</sup> conductances in motor neurons within the ongoing cardiac network, we discovered that compensation both resynchronized the network and helped restore excitability. Using model findings to guide experimentation, we determined that compensatory increases of both G<sub>A</sub> and electrical coupling restored function in the network. This is one of the first direct demonstrations of the physiological regulation of coupling conductance in a compensatory context, and of synergistic plasticity across cell- and network-level mechanisms in the restoration of output."

Through both developmental and ongoing tuning processes, CPGs can maintain reliable network output for decades across the lifespan of an individual, despite constant feedback from the changing nature of both the organismal and natural environment. Yet underlying this constant reliability of network output exists a surprising amount of variability in the individual parameters necessary for producing activity. For instance, despite having nearly identical output across animals, networks can exhibit a five-fold or more range in intrinsic and synaptic conductance values (<a href=\"#bib33\">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schulz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Marder, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Roffman et al., 2012</a>). Such variability in intrinsic conductances is not limited to CPGs, but has been documented in several cell types of the mammalian brain, including cerebellar Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#bib60\">Swensen and Bean, 2005</a>), and globus pallidus neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">G\u00fcnay et al., 2008</a>). Additionally, the\u00a0synaptic strengths between mammalian central neurons have been shown to vary in several brain regions (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nelson and Turrigiano, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Turrigiano, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Maffei et al., 2012</a>)."

We hypothesize that this variability might be a result of ongoing compensatory changes required to maintain reliable output over time. This compensation, termed homeostatic plasticity, has been well documented both for plasticity of intrinsic excitability via changing ionic conductances (<a href=\"#bib74\">Turrigiano et al., 1994</a>), as well as for changes in chemical synaptic strength (<a href=\"#bib9\">Desai, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Turrigiano, 2012</a>). Variability in conductances may also be an adaptive trait in and of itself: variable solutions that produce convergent circuit output may provide a selective advantage, or perhaps be a substrate for adaptation and evolution (<a href=\"#bib33\">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Grashow et al., 2009</a>)."

In the cardiac ganglion (CG) of the Jonah crab (<i>Cancer borealis</i>), five Large Cell motor neurons (LCs) generate completely synchronous output, as a result of pacemaker inputs within the network, to drive simultaneous heart muscle contraction in the crab (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tazaki, 1972</a>). Despite completely uniform and synchronous activity within the network, LCs show highly variable underlying maximal conductances (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ransdell et al., 2012</a>). These variable conductances render the neurons susceptible to perturbations that target a subset of ionic conductances: when high-threshold K<sup>+</sup> currents were blocked with tetraethylammonium (TEA), the motor neurons lost coordinated output and became divergent in their patterns of firing (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ransdell et al., 2013a</a>). These CG neurons compensate for this change in excitability, presumably to homeostatically maintain a target level of excitability (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ransdell et al., 2012</a>). However, none of the network level impacts of this perturbation and plasticity have been investigated. Indeed, it is difficult to study homeostatic plasticity in intact networks and to simultaneously take into account both properties of individual cells as well as their network interactions. In the present study, we discovered that LC variability makes the network vulnerable to desynchronization as a result of TEA exposure, but that compensation resynchronizes the network within 30\u201360 min via both intrinsic cellular and circuit-level physiological mechanisms. To examine the underlying mechanisms, we developed a biophysical computational model of the entire cardiac network. The network model enabled a comprehensive search of the conductance space for potential compensatory mechanisms that preserved network synchrony, and we used these findings to guide further experimentation. Our study revealed cooperative homeostatic plasticity among intrinsic conductances and electrical coupling across multiple cells in the cardiac network. We interpret this as a novel homeostatic compensatory mechanism contributing to the overall robustness of CPG output."

We used this experimental manipulation on the 3 anterior LCs in intact CGs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) causing LCs in the same ganglion to change from identical (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) to divergent, asynchronous output (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,I,II</a>) after exposure to TEA. After application of TEA, motor neurons became noticeably more depolarized during burst potentials and LC spiking seen on the extracellular recordings increased substantially (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Additionally, comparison of intracellular voltage waveforms revealed a loss of conserved output (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that variable underlying conductances of the LCs makes them vulnerable to a uniform perturbation of a subset of conductances such as the TEA blockade that targets high-threshold K<sup>+</sup> conductances. Because our previous results demonstrated that the change in excitability that accompanies TEA exposure in LCs is accompanied by an increase in A-type K<sup>+</sup> current, we hypothesized that compensation may also occur at the network level to restore synchrony among LCs subsequent to the TEA block."

Acutely after application of TEA, we saw a significant reduction in synchrony as measured by R<sup>2</sup> (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ransdell et al., 2013a</a>) across LC voltage waveforms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>, time point II). Following this reduction, waveform synchrony values consistently recovered towards baseline levels, often by 30 min, and were no longer statistically different from baseline by 1 hr of treatment with TEA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right). To monitor compensatory changes in excitability, five different measures of excitability were calculated using both extracellular and intracellular recordings (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; see Experimental Methods). The spikes per burst, average spike frequency, total burst depolarization and burst amplitude all were significantly increased immediately after exposure to TEA ('acute'), while the small cell pacemaker (SC)-to-LC phase delay was significantly decreased (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). All 5 measures also then showed a significant change back towards their baseline levels between the 30 min and 60 min time points. While all measures showed clear shifts towards restoration of baseline excitability, the number of spikes per burst, spike frequency within each burst, burst amplitude, and total burst depolarization were not completely restored to control levels; the exception was the SC-LC phase delay which was fully restored (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Paired LCs (1+2, 4+5) have stronger local coupling (black resistor symbols), and all 5 LCs are reciprocally electrically coupled via weaker gap junctions (gray resistor symbols). An example of LC3 and LC4 model output within a network burst activity is shown in the red and blue traces under both control and TEA (90% reduction in both G<sub>Kd</sub> and G<sub>BKKCa</sub>) conditions. Graphical representations of spike synchrony (raster plots) and waveform synchrony (scatterplots; as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) are shown for the model neurons, demonstrating that both measures reflect the loss of LC synchrony as a result of TEA. (<b>B</b>) Measurements of both output variables (# of spikes and spike synchrony) were made under three model conditions: control, TEA, and TEA + either a 2x increase (G\u2191) or 2x decrease (G\u2193) in a given conductance. N = 27 distinct model networks. All output measurements are normalized to their initial (control) conditions. Red lines represent the mean for a given group. Dashed line represents the 1.0 value (baseline) for a given measure. Compensatory responses that restore excitability and synchrony will tend to move the mean towards baseline."

While it is not difficult to conceive of a change in multiple aspects of the parameter set that could achieve restoration of output, it is perhaps not as intuitive \u2013 but presumably the most parsimonious solution \u2013 for a single conductance to have such an impact. True to this expectation, while various manipulations of G<sub>max</sub> values improved either excitability or synchrony, very few conductance changes improved both. The optimal solution of significantly improving spike synchrony and also significantly decreasing the total number of action potentials was achieved in only one case: two-fold increase in G<sub>A</sub> resulted in a mean synchrony score that was significantly different from the TEA case (p&lt;0.05, paired <i>t</i>-test) but not significantly different from control (p=0.157). No other change in a given conductance resulted in this combination of statistical outcomes. Not every model cell or networked improved uniformly with this conductance change. Therefore, while these results do not rule out a contribution for other conductances, they do suggest that an increase in G<sub>A</sub>, as seen in previous experimental studies on isolated LCs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ransdell et al., 2012</a>), may be the most likely candidate for a change in intrinsic conductance promoting synchrony at the network level. These data suggest that while a single conductance change (increased G<sub>A</sub>) can help restore both excitability and synchrony, variations in a single voltage-dependent conductance may not be sufficient to account for the full compensation response. In addition to perturbing only individual conductances, we also varied current kinetics and activation parameters (half-activation voltage V<sub>1/2</sub>, \u00b1 10 mV, and slope factor <i>k</i>, by 0.5x and 2x (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ballo et al., 2010</a>) and time constant by \u00b1 10 ms) for all the cell currents individually, and found that no changes in parameters for a single current could simultaneously restore excitability at the single cell level, and synchrony at the network level (data not shown). While the analysis has focused only on the parameters of a single current, simultaneous changes in parameters of multiple currents could also potentially provide similar compensation, and that remains to be explored. However, our analysis does reveal the substantial contribution of changing a single parameter \u2013 G<sub>A</sub> \u2013 on multiple aspects of network compensation, to an extent that is beyond simple intuition. Importantly, the model also extends the biological data by demonstrating that waveform synchrony can translate into spike synchrony. Because of the electrotonic distance between the somata and axons of LCs, we cannot measure spike synchrony directly in this preparation. The model allows us to infer that waveform synchrony (and loss of synchrony) can indeed translate to the level of the most proximal cellular output \u2013 spiking."

To test this experimentally, we silenced pacemaker activity with isotonic sucrose solution (see Methods, Supplemental; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and tested the similarity of responses of each individual LC to a biologically realistic current stimulus (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ransdell et al., 2013a</a>). We compared LC3 and LC5 to the same current injection at three time points: control, 5 min post-TEA, and 1 hr post-TEA. Between current injections, pacemaker activity was restarted by removal of the sucrose block. This allows us to test each cell in isolation, but compensation occurs in the intact network. The initial voltage responses to our stimulation protocol in LC3 and LC5 in control conditions are highly similar to one another, and their level of waveform synchrony was not significantly different from the synchronous activity across these LCs during intact control network activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Immediately following TEA application, LC3 and LC5 show disparate output when driven with a common stimulus protocol (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Finally, our data show significant increases in R<sup>2</sup> of voltage activity within 1 hr across isolated LCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), demonstrating that <i>intrinsic</i> compensation does improve <i>network</i> synchrony. However, after 1 hr the synchrony values were significantly lower than control values (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), suggesting that intrinsic compensation alone is insufficient to restore synchrony. To determine whether compensatory changes in I<sub>A</sub> occur in the intact network, we measured I<sub>A</sub> with two-electrode voltage clamp in LCs before and after 1 hr of TEA exposure. Measurements were made while the network activity was temporarily halted with sucrose block, and compensation occurred with ongoing network activity.

Additionally, our results suggest that an increase in coupling among LCs can greatly promote synchrony with only a modest effect on excitability. Therefore, we next used our model networks to investigate how G<sub>A</sub> and G<sub>C</sub> might interact to promote synchrony by calculating synchrony scores as conductances of all 27 model networks were adjusted. First, we increased G<sub>A</sub> alone in 10% increments up to a 100% increase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Increasing G<sub>A</sub> up to +40% promoted greater synchrony after TEA blockade, but was unable to fully restore synchrony even with increasing conductance levels, consistent with our biological data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Increasing G<sub>A</sub> beyond +40% did not further improve synchrony (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), and ultimately caused LCs to cease firing altogether. We also increased model G<sub>C</sub> incrementally (from +10% to +150%), and found that electrical coupling alone was capable of restoring synchrony fully, but this required a 140% increase in its value (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Finally, we increased both G<sub>A</sub> and G<sub>C</sub> together in 10% increments, revealing a potentially synergistic relationship: a smaller increase of 70% in each conductance was able to produce spike synchrony that was indistinguishable from control (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

The interplay of intrinsic and synaptic parameters, and distributed plasticity in determining network output, is difficult, if not impossible, to unravel experimentally.

Over the course of 30\u201360 min, increased I<sub>A</sub> was associated with decreasing cellular excitability [see also (<a href=\"#bib13\">Golowasch et al., 1999</a>)] and improvement of coordinated motor neuron firing. However, intrinsic compensation alone was insufficient to fully restore synchrony across LCs. A concomitant increase in electrotonic coupling ensured virtually complete resynchronization. Our modelling results suggest that although a sufficient increase in electrical coupling alone could restore full synchrony (140% increase), it could not simultaneously restore the original level of excitability. Only a 70% increase was necessary when accompanied by a concomitant increase in G<sub>A</sub>. Therefore, we conclude that multi-component mechanisms are not only necessary for full compensation, but also that their synergistic action is potentially more efficient than either mechanism operating in isolation."

In a series of elegant experiments, it has been shown that chaotic exploratory and consummatory radula biting movements of <i>Aplysia</i> during food searching behaviour can be stably modified by operant conditioning, leading to prolonged bouts of radula movements with increased frequency and more stereotyped rhythmic organization (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nargeot et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nargeot and Simmers, 2011</a>). Chaotic biting patterns result from inherently variable and unsynchronized bursting of CPG neurons that are each randomly capable of triggering bites (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nargeot et al., 2009</a>). Following operant conditioning, induction of regular and synchronized bursting of pattern-initiating cells can be attributed to changes in both intrinsic excitability and electrical coupling strength. Specifically, changes in intrinsic excitability attributed to changes in leak conductance underlie the increase in frequency of motor output, while increases in coupling strength allow for the synchronization and regularization of bursting (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nargeot et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sieling et al., 2014</a>). The full shift in behavioural and circuit output is therefore the additive influence of both intrinsic and electrical synaptic conductances. The striking similarity in these underlying mechanisms suggests that these kinds of circuit-level mechanisms may be a conserved strategy for stabilization of synchrony within network output, be it compensatory or in the context of behavioural plasticity."

Extracellular recordings from the ganglionic trunk were used to calculate the number of spikes per burst and spike frequency. Because our hypothesis predicts both increased LC excitability and desynchronization with TEA exposure, it should be noted that there is a potential confound in distinguishing these effects based on extracellular analysis alone. Axons of all LCs run through the ganglionic trunk, thus the increased spike count observed could result from an increase in the total number of action potentials, desynchronization of action potentials across LCs, or both. We therefore included three additional measures of excitability that helped clarify the effect. We measured the latency between the onset of SC pacemaker bursting to the first LC spike in each burst (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; SC-LC phase delay). Two other measures of excitability were calculated from intracellular voltage changes: burst amplitude and total burst depolarization. Burst amplitude was defined as the maximal voltage change from V<sub>Rest</sub> to the highest peak of the burst, and total depolarization is the area under the curve above V<sub>Rest</sub>, measured in mV*sec. For all measures of excitability, values from 10 consecutive bursts were averaged at each time-point in each preparation (N=8)."

The duration of the pre-TEA response to a 6 nA, 50 ms current injection should be less than 120 ms. Also the peak should be less than \u221222 mV. The duration of the post-TEA (G<sub>BKKCa</sub> and G<sub>Kd</sub> reduced by 90%) response should be between 255\u2013667 ms and its peak should be greater than \u221215 mV. A 9-D max conductance parameter space (5-fold variation over each conductance except G<sub>Leak</sub>) was searched randomly for sets that satisfied the constraints above. We searched 20,000 different combinations of parameter sets with these criteria, and most of those which passed did not have a proper termination of activity following current injection (i.e., did not return to V<sub>rest</sub>). We concluded this was due to an inappropriate relationship between I<sub>CAN</sub> and I<sub>SKKCa</sub>. Subsequent trials revealed that a given ratio range (~1:0.83 respectively) of these two currents was necessary for proper termination of the\u00a0activity. Larger ratios cause V<sub>rest</sub> to be higher due to the reversal potential (\u221230 mV) of CAN current. A higher fraction of I<sub>SKKCa</sub> (reversal potential \u221280mV) caused a large AHP after termination and reduced the duration of the post-TEA response. Using the updated selection criteria with a ratio I<sub>CAN</sub> to I<sub>SKKCa</sub>, we found 180 parameter sets that passed. Of these 180 potential model sets, we selected only the ones that had Synaptic Drive response R<sup>2</sup> value &gt; 0.9 compared to the biological Synaptic Drive response. This resulted in 49 potential parameter sets."

We added this to our criteria for screening potential parameter sets for the network studies. We converted biological I<sub>A</sub>-I<sub>BKKCa</sub> current data into factor data by dividing I<sub>A</sub> and I<sub>BKKCa</sub> by their respective factor average. G<sub>A</sub> and G<sub>BKKCa</sub> values of passed parameters were similarly divided by its average to get its factor data. The biological data were fitted using a linear polynomial from 95% to 70% confidence intervals, in steps of 10%. For network studies we used a 70% confidence interval, which left us with 14 potential parameter sets that represented LC model neurons for use in modeling studies."

We next set out to explore the mechanisms by which excitability and synchrony could be restored in this network. To maximize our ability to interrogate multiple parameters that may be responsible for compensation in this system, we constructed a population of conductance-based biophysical models of the CG network. This allowed us to simulate the TEA conductance blockade and then manipulate individual conductances, both voltage-gated and synaptic, to examine their effects on network excitability and synchrony."

The five cells within a network were then electrically coupled using conductance values tuned to reflect experimental observations of coupling coefficients. Small cell (SC) pacemaker drive was simulated as excitatory synapses via the NetStim function in NEURON. Parameters for the model of the synaptic drive onto LCs were tuned to get 6 to 9 spikes in the nominal LC model. It was observed biologically that frequency of SC firing increases within the slow wave oscillation cycle of LCs. Based on these recordings, the model SC burst initially fired at 18 Hz for first 440 ms and then increased to 25 Hz for 560 ms, with the burst terminating at 1000 ms."

We imposed a final set of selection criteria on the randomly generated model networks, rejecting networks that increased synchrony or decreased the total number of spikes after the simulated TEA block, as this was never observed in biological networks. This left 27 networks that reproduced the biological trends and these were used in subsequent analyses to explore potential conductance changes that could restore network synchrony."

Our biological data qualitatively agreed with this, but a precise quantification of synchrony for all spikes within a burst is subject to many ambiguities. Our model networks easily provided precise spike times for each cell in the network, so we chose to examine actual spike synchrony in the model to complement the burst waveform analysis in the biological preparation. Our analysis considered synchrony for paired anterior LCs with a nominal coupling conductance of 0.0182 S using a 25 ms bin width for spike-times (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wang and Buzs\u00e1ki, 1996</a>). Spikes occurring in both cells during the same bin were considered synchronized, while spikes that did not bin together were tallied as desynchronized. Using the definition of synchrony listed in the next section, these randomly generated model networks exhibited 'control' synchrony scores ranging from 0.642 to 1.0 with a median value of 0.915 (matching data in biology), where 1.0 represents perfect spike synchrony."

Statistical analyses were performed in SigmaPlot v11.0. The effects of changing G<sub>max</sub> on the number of spikes and synchrony among TEA-'treated' model neurons were tested with paired <i>t</i>-tests. Analyses changes in spike number and spike synchrony with changing coupling and synaptic strengths (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) were analyzed with One-Way ANOVAs with post-hoc pairwise comparisons between a given percent change and the TEA case conducted via Holm-Sidak tests."

Over the course of 30-60 minutes synchronization returns and hyperexcitability moderates: compensation. Using an ensemble modeling approach to guide experimentation, the authors identified two distinct and potentially synergistic mechanisms by which motor neurons could compensate and recover synchronous activity: plasticity of an intrinsic voltage-gated conductance (A-type K<sup>+</sup> current, IA) and plasticity of LC electrical coupling. Intrinsic compensation alone in the models was insufficient to fully restore synchrony across motor neurons, but a concomitant increase in electrical coupling ensured nearly complete resynchronization. Modeling also suggests that although a sufficient increase in electrical coupling alone could restore full synchrony, it could not simultaneously restore the original level of excitability. Direct measurements verify both an increase in IA and an increase in electrical coupling conductance associate with re-synchronization in the TEA challenged intact CG over the course of 30-60 minutes. The authors conclude that multi-component mechanisms are likely necessary for full compensation, and that their synergistic action is potentially more efficient than either mechanism operating in isolation."

We showed this is not the case at the single current level, by perturbing conductances of all currents individually. In addition to perturbing only individual conductances, we also varied current kinetics and activation parameters (half-activation voltage V1/2, +/- 10 mV, and slope factor k, by 0.5 and 2 (Ballo et al., 2012) and time constant by +/10 ms) for all the cell currents individually, and found that no changes in parameters for a single current could simultaneously restore excitability at the single cell level, and synchrony at the network level (data not shown). While the analysis has focused only on the parameters of a single current, simultaneous changes in parameters of multiple currents could also potentially provide similar compensation, and that remains to be explored."
