Here, we report that these functions depend on SPOPL, a substrate-specific CUL3 adaptor. We find that SPOPL associates with endosomes and is required for both the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the endocytic host cell entry of influenza A virus. In SPOPL-depleted cells, endosomes are enlarged and fail to acquire intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). We identify a critical substrate ubiquitinated by CUL3-SPOPL as EPS15, an endocytic adaptor that also associates with the ESCRT-0 complex members HRS and STAM on endosomes. Indeed, EPS15 is ubiquitinated in a SPOPL-dependent manner, and accumulates with HRS in cells lacking SPOPL. Together, our data indicates that a CUL3-SPOPL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex regulates endocytic trafficking and MVB formation by ubiquitinating and degrading EPS15 at endosomes, thereby influencing influenza A virus infection as well as degradation of EGFR and other EPS15 targets."

Here, we report that these functions depend on SPOPL, a substrate-specific CUL3 adaptor. We find that SPOPL associates with endosomes and is required for both the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the endocytic host cell entry of influenza A virus. In SPOPL-depleted cells, endosomes are enlarged and fail to acquire intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). We identify a critical substrate ubiquitinated by CUL3-SPOPL as EPS15, an endocytic adaptor that also associates with the ESCRT-0 complex members HRS and STAM on endosomes. Indeed, EPS15 is ubiquitinated in a SPOPL-dependent manner, and accumulates with HRS in cells lacking SPOPL. Together, our data indicates that a CUL3-SPOPL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex regulates endocytic trafficking and MVB formation by ubiquitinating and degrading EPS15 at endosomes, thereby influencing influenza A virus infection as well as degradation of EGFR and other EPS15 targets."

For example, a molecular machine that contains a protein called CUL3 labels other components of the system with a chemical tag to regulate the route cargo takes in mammalian cells.

The label changes how EPS15 interacts with other proteins. When SPOPL is not present in a cell, EPS15 is unnaturally stable and occupies many of the routes used by endocytic cargos. The cargo directly interacting with EPS15 is then routed on the fast lane to its destination, while other cargo accumulate in a kind of molecular traffic jam."

Together these changes prepare the endosomes for fusion with other LEs and LYs.

We performed siRNA screening in the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 depleted for 130 human BTB-containing proteins using expression of the viral nuclear protein (NP) as read-out after IAV addition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Depletion of 14 BTB proteins caused 50% or greater decrease in the number of IAV infected cells. Previously described assays (<a href=\"#bib4\">Banerjee et al., 2013</a>) were used to determine which step in the infection pathway was inhibited, including virus binding to cells, endocytic uptake, acid-conversion of viral hemagglutinin (HA), penetration by fusion, uncoating of the viral capsid, and nuclear import of the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). Out of 14 primary hits, we decided to follow up the BTB proteins SPOP and SPOPL because their depletion gave a phenotype of defective virus uncoating similar to that observed after CUL3 depletion. The other BTB-proteins identified in this screen were required for different steps of efficient IAV infection, and will be studied elsewhere."

They reduced the respective target gene expression efficiently as judged by quantitative RT-PCR. Notably, SPOP depletion also influenced mRNA levels of SPOPL, but not vice versa. Immunoblotting using a home-made, affinity-purified antibody specific for SPOPL confirmed downregulation of SPOPL at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Knockdown of SPOP or SPOPL with the siRNAs resulted in a reduction of viral NP expression in A549 and HeLa cells to levels comparable to CUL3 depletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), but not as strong as upon depletion of a vATPase subunit (siATP6V1B2). As expected, cells that were depleted of either SPOP or SPOPL showed a block in IAV uncoating (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). As a consequence, subsequent nuclear import of NP was also impaired (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). Aside from virus binding to the cell surface, which was elevated in SPOPL-depleted cells, we found that endocytosis, acidification and fusion of the viral particles were comparable to controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013F</a>)."

EPS15 also decreased upon SPOPL depletion when a siRNA resistant construct of SPOPL was overexpressed (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

EPS15 not only promotes EGFR uptake via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but it is also localized in places of intracellular sorting and degradation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gucwa and Brown, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">van Bergen en Henegouwen, 2009</a>). We used super resolution microscopy in structured illumination mode to localize EPS15 in SPOPL-depleted cells and controls. While EPS15 at the plasma membrane was unaffected by SPOPL depletion (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), EPS15 accumulated in intracellular structures upon SPOPL-depletion and increasingly co-localized with the ESCRT-0 subunit HRS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The number and size of the EPS15-containing vesicles was unaffected suggesting that SPOPL-dependent ubiquitination of EPS15 is required to remove it from ESCRT-0 complexes. Because HRS is necessary for cargo sorting into the ESCRT pathway for MVB formation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bache, 2003</a>), it is plausible that the prolonged co-localization of EPS15 with HRS in the absence of SPOPL results in enhanced EGFR sorting to the lysosome. Indeed, the interaction of EPS15 and EGFR is reduced in SPOPL-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), while the interaction of EPS15 and HRS is stabilized (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), consistent with the idea that EPS15 ubiquitination promotes EGFR stabilization. Additionally, we did not detect enhanced EGFR colocalization with recycling endosomes marked by RAB11, although RAB11 staining is elevated in siSPOPL-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Taken together, these data suggest that loss of SPOPL-mediated ubiquitination of EPS15 favors EGFR sorting and trafficking into the lysosomal pathway via HRS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

EGFR is internalized at the plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent endocytosis, which involves recognition of the ubiquitinated receptor by EPS15. EGFR is then either recycled back to the plasma membrane via the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), or targeted for degradation into late endosomes (LE)/lysosomes after its uptake into sorting endosomes (SE)/ multivesicular bodies (MVBs) by the ESCRT machinery. Loss of CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> activity results in enhanced EGFR sorting into the degradative pathway, suggesting that CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup>-mediated ubiquitination of EPS15 at endosomes delays EGFR trafficking to lysosomes.

After SPOPL depletion, the endocytic internalization of the exogenous cargo IAV and the cellular cargo EGF was not inhibited, the morphology and function of EEs appeared to be normal. However, the formation of LEs was compromised. RAB7 positive endosomes were enlarged and failed to acquire ILVs. We identified the endocytic adaptor protein EPS15 as a direct ubiquitination target of CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup>. Upon SPOPL depletion, EPS15 was enriched in endosomes co-localizing with the ESCRT-0 complex subunit HRS. Taken together, the results indicated that SPOPL together with CUL3 regulates the endosome pathway by ubiquitinating EPS15 and inducing its degradation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The degradation of EPS15 is required for ILV formation and possibly other aspects of endosome maturation. The immature LEs can support IAV acidification and penetration by membrane fusion but not uncoating of the capsids, a process that occurs on the cytosolic surface of LEs."

EPS15 possesses four domains: a N-terminal domain with three EH motifs, a central coiled-coil domain involved in dimerization, and a C-terminal regulatory domain with the AP2-binding site followed by two UIM motifs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib53\">van Bergen en Henegouwen, 2009</a>). Perturbation of EPS15 and EPSIN1 function blocks endocytosis of EGF and transferrin, demonstrating that they are part of the primary endocytic machinery at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carbone et al., 1997</a>). In addition, EPS15 promotes vesicular trafficking intracellularly (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yuan et al., 2014</a>).

Our own data shows that ubiquitination by the CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> complex inhibits EPS15 function in endosome maturation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In this case, ubiquitination may control the timing and duration of EPS15 interaction with ESCRT-0, which in turn may influence ILV formation and the efficiency of lysosomal sorting and degradation of EGFR and other targets. It may also prevent the remodeling of the endosomal limiting membrane during endosome maturation, leading to loss of components needed for uncoating of incoming IAV capsids."

Taken together, these findings indicate that EPS15 promotes sorting of ubiquitinated EGFR at endosomes by interacting with HRS.

In contrast to SPOPL depletion, the depletion of USP9X leads to slower degradation of EGFR. Therefore, it is evident that a cycle of ubiquitination / de-ubiquitination of EPS15 not only regulates the internalization pathway, but is also involved in the sorting of cargo in LEs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Ubiquitination may increase EPS15 turnover in endosomes. This may first involve EPS15 binding to its own UIM domains followed by poly-ubiquitination to target EPS15 for proteasomal degradation. While SPOPL-depletion promotes the HRS- and ESCRT-dependent fast-forward sorting route for EPS15 client cargo, other sorting processes may be inhibited due to depletion of the ESCRT processing machinery. Indeed, ILV formation is a dynamic and tightly regulated process that involves recycling of the ESCRT components by VPS4 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babst et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sachse, 2004</a>). It is evident that ILV formation depends on SPOPL, and that loss of available ESCRT complexes due to loss of CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> activity prevents the reduction in the surface area of the endosomal limiting membrane. This is reflected in both the lack of ILVs and the apparent size-increase in LEs."

This late penetrating virus was endocytosed normally and reached a late endosomal compartment acidic enough to induce HA-conversion and membrane fusion/hemifusion. However, the uncoating process that involves dissociation of the matrix protein M1 shell and release of the vRNPs from the endosome did not take place. Recent studies have indicated that uncoating of IAV capsids is a complex process that requires priming of the viral capsid prior to fusion by exposure to low pH and potassium ions in the lumen of endosomes as well as\u00a0the function of the ubiquitin-vacuolar protein sorting system and interaction with a number of host cell factors in the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib5\">Banerjee et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib28\">Khor et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Martin and Helenius, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Stauffer et al., 2014</a>). While we found that acidification of IAV occurred in the absence of SPOPL and CUL3, it is possible that the exposure to an elevated potassium concentration in late endosomes did not take place. It is also possible that cellular factors associated with LE membrane and needed for uncoating, such as the E3 ligase ITCH, did not associate with immature endosomes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Su et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, the EGFR level could be crucial for IAV entry, since EGFR signaling is required for efficient IAV infection. Available evidence suggests that virus binding leads to lipid-raft clustering, which activates EGFR and other RTKs and facilitates IAV uptake (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eierhoff et al., 2010</a>)."

Overall, the reviewers think the paper is potentially interesting and appropriate for <i>eLife</i> but in its current form falls short of what is necessary. In particular, the findings presented do not result in a clear and coherent model for the molecular function of the Cul3-SPOPL E3 ubiquitin ligase with respect to endosomal trafficking. In particular, the observation that SPOPL is required for MVB formation and for IAV entry, but EGFR is trafficked to the lysosome for degradation more rapidly in SPOPL-depleted cells suggests a significant disconnect in terms of the mechanisms proposed. The authors do attempt to address this apparent discrepancy in the Discussion (subsection \u201cEPS15 regulates EGFR trafficking at several steps\u201d, last paragraph) by suggesting that increased interaction between EPS15 and ESCRT-0 in SPOPL-depleted cells may enhance the trafficking of EPS15-interacting cargo (like EGFR) at the expense of other EPS15-independent cargos (presumably IAV). This seems like a reasonable hypothesis \u2013 and it is intriguing to speculate that Cul3-SPOPL could regulate cargo flux into the MVB pathway along a specific route \u2013 but there are many other observations that complicate this interpretation. For example, the morphological data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and alterations to the abundance of multiple trafficking proteins (EEA1, HRS, STAM, EPS15, LAMP1, AP-2, almost every piece of trafficking machinery they probe in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) suggest gross trafficking defects along the endocytic route. This is further complicated by the observation that depletion of SPOPL does not phenocopy depletion of CUL3 with respect to EGFR trafficking \u2013 and in fact results in an opposite trafficking phenotype."

You could test this by knocking down SPOPL in a context where EPS15 cannot engage HRS (either a binding mutant or an EPS15 knockdown), which should restore the trafficking of non-EPS15 cargo. For example, coordinate knockdown of SPOPL and EPS15 should restore IAV infectivity/uncoating. Such an experiment would demonstrate that the observed trafficking defects are indeed dependent on excessive engagement of ESCRT-0 by EPS15."

To address the concern that the global membrane trafficking network is grossly perturbed in the absence of SPOPL and CUL3, you may consider probing how loss of Cul3-SPOPL affects trafficking more broadly (clathrin, EPS15R, epsins, other ESCRT components, GGAs, etc.). This would not need to be exhaustive, but it could reveal key insights into just how grossly perturbed trafficking is in these cells."

This seems like a reasonable hypothesis \u2013 and it is intriguing to speculate that Cul3-SPOPL could regulate cargo flux into the MVB pathway along a specific route \u2013 but there are many other observations that complicate this interpretation. For example, the morphological data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and alterations to the abundance of multiple trafficking proteins (EEA1, HRS, STAM, EPS15, LAMP1, AP-2, almost every piece of trafficking machinery they probe in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) suggest gross trafficking defects along the endocytic route. This is further complicated by the observation that depletion of SPOPL does not phenocopy depletion of CUL3 with respect to EGFR trafficking \u2013 and in fact results in an opposite trafficking phenotype.</i> "

As suggested, we have thus expanded the analysis of trafficking pathways in cells lacking SPOPL. Interestingly, our data now show that SPOPL depletion does not cause gross perturbations of the endosomal system but that SPOPL has rather specific effects on EPS15-dependent cargo and MVB homeostasis (revised <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). IAV infection relies on proper MVB formation, but also on EGFR turnover. In fact, depletion of EGFR alone strongly impairs IAV infection (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>), and it is thus not surprising that regulation of EGFR trafficking by CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> has a strong impact on IAV infection."

Supporting this hypothesis, it was recently shown that the DUB enzyme USP9X deubiquitinates EPS15 and increases its on/off binding dynamics to EGFR, thereby similarly enhancing EGFR degradation (Savio et al., 2016). Together, these data provide strong support that ubiquitination of EPS15 by CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> and de-ubiquitination by USP9X orchestrate EGFR trafficking to lysosomes at MVBs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

Indeed, EGFR levels increase in cells depleted for CUL3 or treated with the CRL-inhibitor MLN-4924, but decrease in cells depleted for SPOPL. This phenotypic difference is however not surprising, since unlike SPOPL, CUL3 regulates several additional steps required for IAV infection. In fact, as shown in the revised <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, we identified many CUL3 adaptor proteins that influence IAV infection and might have an impact on endocytosis. Thus, while SPOPL regulates later steps of cargo delivery to LE / lysosomes, other adaptors might influence cargo uptake or other trafficking steps not affected by SPOPL. Therefore, depletion of CUL3 might inhibit EGFR degradation at other steps, while SPOPL specifically regulates the fate of EGFR at late endosomes/MVB formation. In summary, the observed difference in EGFR degradation in CUL3 and SPOPL depleted cells does not indicate that SPOPL functions independently of CUL3, but rather that CUL3 uses adaptors other than SPOPL to regulate additional steps that block EGFR trafficking to lysosomes (Huotari et al., 2012). Further studies are thus needed to unravel the molecular function of the here listed CUL3 adaptors for endocytosis, EGFR trafficking and IAV infection."

You could test this by knocking down SPOPL in a context where EPS15 cannot engage HRS (either a binding mutant or an EPS15 knockdown), which should restore the trafficking of non-EPS15 cargo. For example, coordinate knockdown of SPOPL and EPS15 should restore IAV infectivity/uncoating. Such an experiment would demonstrate that the observed trafficking defects are indeed dependent on excessive engagement of ESCRT-0 by EPS15.</i> As suggested by the reviewers, we performed additional experiments. The result supports the model of an excessive engagement of ESCRT-0 with EPS15 in SPOPL-depleted cells. We could now demonstrate that a simultaneous knockdown of EPS15 and SPOPL partially restores EGFR levels (new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), supporting the notion that SPOPL regulates EPS15 sorting function at late endosomes/MVB\u2019s. We also tried to rescue IAV infection/uncoating by co-depleting EPS15 and SPOPL. However, EPS15 depletion alone already caused a significant reduction in IAV infection (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 2A</a>) indicating a broader function in endocytic traffic. Indeed, upon depletion of EPS15 we observed an increase in the ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I components HRS, STAM and TSG101 (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 2B</a>)."

Not surprisingly therefore, double knockdown of SPOPL and EPS15 does not rescue IAV infection but instead has an additive effect (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 2C</a>). Even if HRS and STAM are freed from EPS15 during SPOPL depletion, IAV infection will still be inhibited due to broader changes in endosomal traffic caused by EPS15 depletion. We thus believe that this new data identified EPS15 as a critical factor in not only cargo internalization but also late endosomal progression. This underlines the importance of regulation of endosome maturation by SPOPL."

To evaluate whether SPOPL regulates general or specific effects of EPS15 we analyzed a number of receptor tyrosine kinases, classic targets of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, upon SPOPL depletion via western blotting (new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Strikingly, out of five receptors only two were affected by SPOPL depletion: EGFR and MET, both known to associate directly with EPS15 (Parachoniak and Park, 2009; Torrisi et al., 1999). In contrast, the level of VEGFR3, IGF1R and even HER2, a close relative of EGFR, were not altered in SPOPL-depleted cells.

To address the concern that the global membrane trafficking network is grossly perturbed in the absence of SPOPL and CUL3, you may consider probing how loss of Cul3-SPOPL affects trafficking more broadly (clathrin, EPS15R, epsins, other ESCRT components, GGAs, etc.). This would not need to be exhaustive, but it could reveal key insights into just how grossly perturbed trafficking is in these cells.</i> To evaluate whether SPOPL depletion causes global changes in endosomal trafficking we analyzed additional endocytic trafficking markers in two different cell lines (new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Importantly, we did not observe strong defects in early steps of endocytosis (clathrin, caveolin), the recycling pathway (RAB11 level), and ER homeostasis (Calnexin). Even the levels of RAB7, a marker for late endosomes did not change upon SPOPL depletion, despite late endosomes being strongly enlarged (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, we did observe a strong effect on proteins located to endosomes and multivesicular bodies, including the ESCRT-0 components EPS15, HRS and STAM, as well as ESCRT-I component TSG101. In contrast, the ESCRT-III component CHMP6 remained unaffected, suggesting dysregulation of the early ESCRT system involved in cargo-recognition and sorting. Importantly, while EPS15 was stabilized by SPOPL depletion in both cell lines, only minor effects were observed on its close relatives EPS15R and Epsin, underlining the specificity of SPOPL-induced EPS15 ubiquitination. In summary these data show that SPOPL-mediated ubiquitination of EPS15 causes specific defects at the step of ILV formation of multivesicular bodies resulting in dysregulation of late endosomal biogenesis. This new data is now shown in the revised <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, and its implications are discussed in the revised text."

When SPOPL is depleted, is the decreased stability of other trafficking factors (LAMP1, AP-2) proteasome- or lysosome-dependent? (Presumably this is not mediated by some other CUL3 complex since loss of CUL3 also destabilized AP2.)</i> Upon further analysis we noticed that LAMP1 protein levels were only decreased by SPOPL depletion in HeLa cells while no such effect could be observed in A549 cells (new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Similarly, AP2 reduction was cell line specific, and required efficient SPOPL depletion for rather long time periods (72 hours). It thus seems likely that the destabilizing effect on both proteins caused by SPOPL depletion is of secondary nature and most likely represents a context-dependent maturation defect. Co-treatment with proteasomal or lysosomal inhibitors would therefore be difficult to interpret and most likely cause unspecific changes in protein levels. After careful analysis of additional endosomal markers (see above, new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), we concluded that SPOPL depletion causes trafficking defects mainly at multivesicular bodies and affects early endosomes and lysosomes only in a secondary manner.
