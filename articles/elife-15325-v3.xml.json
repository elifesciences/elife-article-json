Here, we utilize behavioral and anatomical techniques to extend the current understanding of neural mechanisms that mediate pair bond maintenance. For both sexes, we show that pair bonding up-regulates mRNA expression for genes encoding D1-like dopamine (DA) receptors and dynorphin as well as enhances stimulated DA release within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We next show that D1-like receptor regulation of selective aggression is mediated through downstream activation of kappa-opioid receptors (KORs) and that activation of these receptors mediates social avoidance. Finally, we also identified sex-specific alterations in KOR binding density within the NAc shell of paired males and demonstrate that this alteration contributes to the neuroprotective effect of pair bonding against drug reward. Together, these findings suggest motivational and valence processing systems interact to mediate the maintenance of social bonds."

Here, we utilize behavioral and anatomical techniques to extend the current understanding of neural mechanisms that mediate pair bond maintenance. For both sexes, we show that pair bonding up-regulates mRNA expression for genes encoding D1-like dopamine (DA) receptors and dynorphin as well as enhances stimulated DA release within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We next show that D1-like receptor regulation of selective aggression is mediated through downstream activation of kappa-opioid receptors (KORs) and that activation of these receptors mediates social avoidance. Finally, we also identified sex-specific alterations in KOR binding density within the NAc shell of paired males and demonstrate that this alteration contributes to the neuroprotective effect of pair bonding against drug reward. Together, these findings suggest motivational and valence processing systems interact to mediate the maintenance of social bonds."

The socially monogamous prairie vole (<i>Michrotus ochrogaster</i>) presents an ideal animal model to study the neural correlates of social bond maintenance because, unlike most mammals (<a href=\"#bib53\">Kleiman, 1977</a>), prairie voles form selective and enduring attachments to their mating partner (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aragona et al., 2009</a>). In both the field and laboratory, the maintenance of these bonds is associated with the expression of selective aggression towards novel conspecifics as well as selective affiliation with the mating partner (i.e., mate guarding) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Carter and Getz, 1993</a>). Importantly, the expression of selective aggression provides a robust and reliable assay that can be utilized in a laboratory setting to deconstruct neural signaling pathways involved in the regulation of social bond maintenance."

Thus, regulation of pair bond maintenance requires neural systems that code evaluation of salient environmental stimuli as well as those that are important for the generation of motivational states (<a href=\"#bib72\">Resendez and Aragona, 2013</a>). Interestingly, in other animal models, these receptor systems have been shown to directly interact at the molecular level (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gerfen et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Carlezon et al., 1998</a>) as well as in the transition between motivational states (<a href=\"#bib24\">Chartoff et al., 2016</a>). However, it is unknown if similar interactions occur in the regulation of pair bond maintenance. This study therefore endeavored to examine pair bond induced neural plasticity within the DA and dynorphin/KOR systems as well as how these systems interact to mediate the expression of selective aggression, a well established indicator of a fully established pair bond."

Next, to assess how the establishment of a pair bond alters both motivational (DA) and aversive (dynorphin/KOR) processing systems, we conducted extensive anatomical, neurochemical, and functional comparisons within the striatum of male and female prairie voles. In total, we conducted mRNA expression analysis (RT-qPCR), protein binding measurements (receptor autoradiography), and measures of DA concentration (fast-scan cyclic-voltammetry) to identify sex-specific alterations within the DA and dynorphin/KOR systems of pair bonded voles. We next utilized site-specific behavioral pharmacology to examine interactions between NAc shell D1-like and KORs in the expression of selective aggression. Finally, in male prairie voles, we show that pair bonding, but not other social manipulations, decreases the rewarding properties of the psychostimulant amphetamine and that this attenuation requires the activation of NAc shell KORs. In total, the present study demonstrates that the development of a pair bond is underpinned by sex-specific modifications in motivational (DA/D1) and valence (dynorphin/KOR) processing systems, that these systems interact to mediate selective aggression in both sexes, and that male specific alterations in the dynorphin/KOR system buffers against the rewarding properties of amphetamine."

For example, pairing of a previously neutral stimulus with either an aversive experience that results in KOR activation, such as stress, or with direct pharmacological activation of these receptors results in the avoidance of that stimulus during subsequent encounters (<a href=\"#bib55\">Land et al., 2008</a>). Given the known relationship between aversive processing of environmental stimuli, avoidance behaviors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boren et al., 1959</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">D'Amato et al., 1967</a>), and KOR activation, we hypothesized that one mechanism in which NAc shell KORs mediate social avoidance behaviors is through the encoding of novel social stimuli as aversive."

Specifically, we employed a social pairing condition (1\u2009hr cohabitation with an opposite sex conspecific) that is insufficient to produce a preference for the familiar partner over an unfamiliar conspecific (the stranger). A lack of a preference for either social stimulus is indicated by equivalent amounts of time spent with the partner and stranger during the social choice test, suggesting that both social stimuli are of equal valences. As expected, a Wilcoxon signed rank sum test for non-parametric data demonstrated that control males treated with aCSF did not show a preference for either individual (W<sub>(5)</sub> = 33, z = \u22120.97, p=0.33) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b,c</a>). Conversely, male subjects that were administered a KOR agonist (1\u2009\u03bcg U50,488) into the NAc shell immediately prior to pairing with the female partner avoided the female that had been paired with KOR activation and therefore displayed a robust preference for contact with the novel female that had not been previously paired with NAc shell KOR (Wilcoxon signed rank sum test, W<sub>(6)</sub> = 32.5, z = -2.56, p=0.01) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b,c</a>). In addition to differences in direct contact time, activation of NAc shell KORs prior to pairing with a social stimulus also resulted in differences in the duration of time spent in each stimulus chamber (two-way ANOVA, (<i>F</i><sub>(2,36)\u00a0</sub>= 7.07, p=0.003). Specifically, males that received administration of a KOR agonist avoided the chamber containing the partner (Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test, p=0.02) and spent more time in the chamber occupied by the stranger (p=0.0006) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Finally, control males and males receiving site-specific administration of the KOR agonistdid not differ in total contact time (time spent with partner + time spent with stranger) (t-test, <i>t</i><sub>(11)</sub> = 0.35, p=0.73), indicating that reduced contact with the partner did not result from a general decrease in motivation for social contact (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>). Both groups of male subjects also did not differ in affiliative social behavior or grooming behavior during the 1\u2009hr cohabitation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

These receptors are primarily of the low-affinity sub-type (<a href=\"#bib76\">Richfield et al., 1989</a>) and their activation requires high concentrations of DA to be released, such as that which occurs during burst firing of DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib42\">Gonon, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Cheer et al., 2007</a>). Given that activation of D1-like receptors require high concentrations of DA release and that selective aggression is only expressed in the pair bonded state, we predicted that pair bonded voles would have greater concentrations in DA release specifically within the NAc shell. To compare DA release dynamics between non-bonded and pair bonded voles, we utilized fast-scan cyclic-voltammetry (FSCV) to measure real-time DA release across the striatum. However, given that striatal DA release properties are unknown in this species, we first conducted a detailed characterization of DA release dynamics within the prairie vole striatum (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,b</a>)."

This sex difference in pair bond induced changes in DA transmission is unlikely due to initial sex differences in NAc shell DA release as differences in DA release within the NAc shell were not identified between non-paired male and females (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

Moreover, direct comparisons of aggression levels among males and females from sub-optimally and optimally pregnant pairs indicates that sex differences in the magnitude of selective aggression that is displayed toward an intruder depends on pair fecundity (two way ANOVA, <i>F</i><sub>(1,37)</sub> = 8.32, p=0.007). Specifically, although paired males are generally more aggressive than paired females, when aggression levels were further compared by fecundity classification, only males from optimally pregnant pairs showed significantly higher levels of selective aggression than females (Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test, optimally pregnant: p=0.01, sub-optimally pregnant: p&gt;0.99) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

However, it should be noted that despite a lack of overall differences in DA transmission within the dorsal striatum based on the categorization of pairs by pregnancy, a comparatively modest correlation between DA transmission and pregnancy was found within the dorsal striatum of males (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Nonetheless, these data suggest that fecundity exerts sex-specific effects on DA transmission dynamics in pair bonded prairie voles.

Additionally, no relationship between stimulated DA release and attack frequency was found within other regions of the striatum for either sex (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, the relationship between stimulated DA release and attack behavior in pair bonded prairie behaviors occurs in a sex and region specific manner. When these data are considered in combination with site-specific pharmacology data demonstrating that activation of D1-like DA receptors specifically within the NAc shell is required for the expression of selective aggression (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aragona et al., 2006</a>), they suggest that the degree to which DA transmission dynamics are altered within the NAc shell of paired males may underlie fecundity induced modulation of pair bond strength. In other words, enhancement of DA release would facilitate the activation of low-affinity D1-like receptors, possibly leading to the display of higher levels of aggression by males from optimally pregnant pairs. Moreover, stimulation of D1-like receptors results in the production of dynorphin (<a href=\"#bib36\">Engber et al., 1992</a>), the endogenous ligand for KORs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Chavkin et al., 1982</a>) and activation of these receptors is also required for the expression of selective aggression (<a href=\"#bib74\">Resendez et al., 2012</a>).

The consistent requirement for higher doses of a KOR agonist to observe either a behavioral or physiological impact in prairie voles suggests potential value in comparing the genetic sequence of the prairie vole KOR to other species that have been used to study KOR pharmacology (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, and humans). Indeed, the prairie vole KOR is distinct from the above-mentioned species as its genetic sequence diverges from that of rats and mice (whose KOR structure is quite homologous) as well as humans and guinea pigs (whose KORs also share substantial homologies) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is also notable to mention that the prairie vole KOR is more similar to that of humans and guinea pigs than that of rats and mice in which most pharmacological studies have been conducted. In total, there are four amino acids that are unique to prairie voles, humans, and guinea pigs (Alanine 28, Serine 186, Aspartic acid 218, Aspartic acid 374), one amino acid that is unique to humans and prairie voles (Isoleucine 232), and fifteen amino acids that are unique to prairie voles, including one residue that is located in the dynorphin binding site (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rasakham and Liu-Chen, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Wu et al., 2012</a>). It is possible that these genetic differences may partially account for species differences in KOR pharmacology and determining how ligands interact with the prairie vole KOR will be an important future area of study.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that D1-like receptor regulation of selection aggression is upstream of its regulation by KORs. Similar to the anatomical characterization studies described above, prairie voles were paired with an opposite sex conspecific for 2 weeks to allow sufficient time for a pair bond to be established. At the end of the cohabitation period, site-specific behavioral pharmacology was utilized in combination with resident intruder testing to examine the sequential nature of interactions between activation of D1-like receptors and KORs on the expression of selective aggression (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>). More specifically, if KOR activation is indeed downstream of D1-like receptor activation than activation of KORs despite pharmacological blockade of D1-like receptors should still result in the expression of selective aggression. Conversely, pharmacological manipulations that would result in a reduction in KOR activation, such as administration of a D1-like antagonist in the absence of a KOR agonist or administration of a KOR antagonist in the presence of a D1-like receptor agonist, should attenuate the expression of selective aggression."

To this end, we conducted a detailed analysis of pair bond associated social experiences that may contribute to the social buffering of drug reward. Specifically, male subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: social familiarity (i.e., same-sex sibling housed), extended cohabitation with a novel social stimulus without mating (i.e., 2 weeks cohabitation with a novel male or ovariectomized female), or extended cohabitation with a reproductive partner (2 weeks cohabitation with an intact female). Given that not all gonadally intact male-female pairs achieved pregnancy, males housed with an intact female were further categorized by the reproductive status of the female partner at the completion of testing (i.e., no indication of pregnancy, sub-optimally pregnant, or optimally pregnant). Exposing males to these different social experiences as well as categorizing mating pairs by their reproductive status allowed us to determine the influence of each social condition on the protective effects of pair bonding (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11a</a>)."

However, following extended cohabitation with a breeding partner and the full development of a pair bond, prairie voles aggressively reject novel conspecifics. In the present study, we critically extend current understanding of the neural mechanisms that mediate the transition to the pair bonded state by identifying neuroplasticity within the NAc shell that regulates the maintenance of monogamous bonds. Specifically, compared to non-paired subjects, pair bonded males and females have enhanced DA release potential within the NAc as well as an up-regulation of D1 receptor and dynorphin mRNA within this region. The functional significance of this pair bond induced plasticity was demonstrated with site-specific pharmacology as blockade of either one of these receptor systems attenuates the expression of pair bond maintenance. Moreover, while both sexes show some degree of mate guarding behavior, paired males are generally more aggressive than paired females and in the present study we provide the first mechanistic data to explain sex differences in the expression of selective aggression. Compared to females, pair bonded males exhibited additional neuroplasticity within the NAc as well as fecundity dependent alterations in DA transmission including: a positive correlation between DA release and pair fecundity, decreased binding of KORs, and enhanced KOR regulation over DA transmission. These more robust alterations within the NAc of males may partially explain why males show more intense mate guarding than females as well as the dependence of male mate guarding on fecundity. Finally, we also show that AMPH exposure alters KOR binding density within a sex-specific manner and that neuroplasticity within the dynorphin/KOR system of pair bonded males is critical for pair bond induced attenuation of drug reward. Together, the data presented in the present study reveal novel mechanisms underlying the maintenance of monogamous pair bonds as well as the neural protective effects of social bonding against drug reward."

In regards to pair bond formation, the initial stages of bond development are mediated in part by D2-like, oxytocin, vassporessin, and mu-opioid receptors systems located within reward processing regions of the brain such as the striatum and the ventral pallidum (<a href=\"#bib48\">Insel et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Young et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Resendez and Aragona, 2013</a>).

One possible explanation of why a lack of an alteration in receptor systems associated with partner preference behavior was not observed in the present study is that a preference for social proximity is required in both the bonded and non-bonded state, while the emergence of an aversion towards social novelty is specific to the establishment of a pair bond and requires alterations in both social and motivational circuitry (<a href=\"#bib72\">Resendez and Aragona, 2013</a>)."

As such, it is not surprising that neuroplasticity associated with pair bond development occurs within systems that mediate the expression of social behaviors associated with pair bond maintenance, DA/D1 and dynorphin/KOR systems and that these alterations occur specifically within the NAc shell, the striatal sub-region where these receptor systems act to mediate pair bond maintenance. Moreover, behavioral pharmacological data make evident the functional significance of these alterations by demonstrating that activation of KORs within the NAc shell of prairie voles mediates the assignment of negative social valence onto novel conspecifics, while blockade of either D1-like or KORs abolishes selective aggression. Together, these data support the working hypothesis that neuroplasticity within the NAc shell stabilizes established pair bonds by enhancing the perceived negative valence of novel social stimuli and the promotion of robust mate guarding."

While this breeding strategy is adaptive for some species, mate guarding behavior is intensely energetically costly given that a great deal of time must be spent maintaining proximity to the female and a high level of energy expended engaging in risky agonistic social encounters with competitor males (<a href=\"#bib67\">Parker, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Grafen and Ridley, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Getz et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Crews and Moore, 1986</a>). As a result, males can usually only successfully guard one female at a time (<a href=\"#bib13\">Brotherton et al., 2003</a>) and, to maximize reproductive fitness, it is adaptive for mate guarding behavior to emerge only after the establishment of a reproductively successful pair bond (<a href=\"#bib74\">Resendez et al., 2012</a>). For the socially monogamous prairie vole, an indication of pair fecundity is indeed required for males to transition to the pair bonded state (<a href=\"#bib32\">Curtis, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Resendez et al., 2012</a>); yet the neural mechanisms that underlie this sex difference have remained elusive.

Moreover, significant enhancements in NAc shell DA transmission only occurred in males from optimally pregnant pairs and males from these pairs also showed significantly higher levels of selective aggression. Thus, neuroplastic changes that are associated with the expression of selective aggression only occur in paired males when an adaptive benefit in defending the female partner has been established (i.e., when the benefit of defending the female outweighs the risk associated with aggressive conflict as well as predation risks that may occur when searching for a new mate)."

One possible explanation for a lack of influence for fecundity on both neural and behavioral changes associated with pair bonding in females is a difference between males and females in the ultimate mechanisms that underlie the decision to bond with a partner. For instance, given that the reproductive status of the male is constant, whereas females require extended periods of contact with a male for sexual receptivity to be induced (<a href=\"#bib21\">Carter et al., 1987</a>), it may be more beneficial for a female to increase the likelihood of reproductive success by remaining in contact with a male partner than to risk predation by searching for a new mate. Moreover, unlike males, female mammals do not risk exerting unnecessary energy raising offspring that are not their own if their male partner engages in extra-pair copulations (<a href=\"#bib87\">Trivers and Campbell, 1972</a>). Thus, the risk to reward ratio for engaging in agonistic social encounters may not be as great for females and may also partially explain why females tend to be less aggressive overall than males. Together, sex differences in the adaptive value of mate guarding as well as sex differences in temporal and environmental factors that regulate reproductive activation between males and females may partially underlie known sex differences in the intensity of selective aggression as well as behavioral and neural neuroplasticity associated with the transition to the bonded state."

Specifically, the release of dynorphin into the dorso-medial region of NAc shell and the subsequent activation of KOR induces positive hedonics (<a href=\"#bib22\">Castro and Berridge, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Hasani et al., 2015</a>), while the release of dynorphin into the ventral NAc shell induces aversion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Hasani et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, pair bonding altered the binding density of male NAc shell KORs in a sub-region specific manner that maps onto the topographical organizational of the aversive coding properties of the dynorphin/KOR system. Pair bonding down-regulated KOR binding within the ventral region of the NAc shell, while leaving KOR binding within the dorso-medial and lateral regions of the NAc shell unaltered. Thus, pair bonding altered KOR binding only in the sub-region of the NAc shell where activation of these receptors acts to encode aversion."

                                "text": "One possible mechanism underlying the sub-region specific influence of the dynorphin/KOR system on valence coding may be due to anatomical heterogeneity in the downstream projection targets of the dorso-medial and ventral regions of the NAc shell. In general, downstream projection targets from the afferents of cell bodies originating in the dorsomedial region of the NAc shell are more widespread than those originating from cell bodies located in the ventral region of the NAc shell. For cell bodies located in the dorso-medial NAc shell, the highest density of afferents are located in the medial region of the ventral pallidum (VP), the lateral preoptic area, and the lateral hypothalamus with sparser fiber labeling occurring within the lateral septum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the anterior hypothalamus, the medial preoptic area, and rostral portion of the ventral tegmental area (<a href=\"#bib86\">Thompson and Swanson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Zahm et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, the ventral region of the NAc shell varies from the dorso-medial region of the NAc shell in both the number and specific brain regions it projects to. While the dorso-medial NAc shell sends dense projections to the medial region of the VP (<a href=\"#bib86\">Thompson and Swanson, 2010</a>), the ventral region of the NAc shell projects specifically to the lateral region of the VP and also sends sparser projections to the lateral preoptic area and rostral-caudal extent of the ventral tegmental area (<a href=\"#bib98\">Zahm et al., 2013</a>). It is therefore possible that although the release of dynorphin and the subsequent activation of NAc shell KORs has the potential to reduce dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmission throughout the entire dorsal-ventral axis of the NAc shell (<a href=\"#bib45\">Hjelmstad and Fields, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Britt and McGehee, 2008</a>), the sum of the influence on downstream neuronal networks has the potential to vary greatly between the two sub-regions."

                                "text": "One notable downstream projection target that is unique to the ventral NAc shell is the lateral region of the VP. The lateral VP is an important brain region for reward processing (<a href=\"#bib31\">Cromwell and Berridge, 1993</a>) and is innervated by NAc shell medium spiny neurons that primarily express Gi-coupled D2-like DA receptors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Gerfen and Young, 1988</a>). Thus, KOR-mediated reductions in DA within the ventral NAc shell would increase the activity of GABAeregic medium spiny neurons that project to the lateral VP, resulting in the inhibition of this region (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bonci and Carlezon, 2005</a>). Interestingly, reduced activity has been observed directly within the VP following exposure to aversive stimuli (<a href=\"#bib49\">Itoga et al., 2016</a>) as well as an increase in activity within brain nuclei that receive input specifically from GABAergic neurons located within the lateral region of VP. Of specific interest is the relief of inhibition of the periventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a brain nucleus that is downstream of the VP and has been indicated in aversive processing (<a href=\"#bib93\">Yashoshima et al., 2007</a>). In contrast to the ventral NAc shell, reductions in DA specifically within the dorso-medial region of the NAc shell would cause a decrease in the activity of the PVT through inhibition of glutamatergic afferents from the LH that project to the PVT (<a href=\"#bib86\">Thompson and Swanson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Zahm et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the ventral NAc shell \u2192 lateral VP \u2192 PVT circuit may be one mechanism in which site-specific modulation of NAc shell KORs contributes to aversive coding, while the dorso-medial NAc shell \u2192 LH \u2192 PVT circuit may contribute to positive valence coding by NAc KORs. However, more work is necessary to determine how topographical organization of NAc shell contributes to opposing modulation of valence coding and the subsequent divergent responses on motivated behavioral states, such as approach versus avoidance behaviors."

Indeed, studies of pair bond formation show that partner preferences require concurrent activation of D2-like and OT receptors within the NAc shell (<a href=\"#bib58\">Liu and Wang, 2003</a>) as well as V1a receptor activation within the VP (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lim et al., 2004</a>). These previous studies argued that peptide systems are necessary for social recognition, while DA transmission is important for reward processing (<a href=\"#bib97\">Young and Wang, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Johnson and Young, 2015</a>). In the present study, we expand our current understanding of neural mechanisms involved in the regulation of pair bond behavior by demonstrating that interactions between opioid peptides, such as the dynorphin/KOR system, and DA transmission within the NAc may act to couple valence processing systems within motivational circuitry. Consistent with the theory that interactions between these systems mediate pair bond induced transitions in the valence encoding of novel social stimuli, previous studies of drug reward have demonstrated that interactions between DA/D1 and dynorphin/KOR systems mediate the propensity for previously rewarding stimuli to be processed as aversive. Specifically, stimulation of D1-like receptors phosphorylates cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) to induce the expression and release of dynorphin (<a href=\"#bib18\">Carlezon et al., 1998</a>), resulting in the valence encoding of a psychostimulant to be reversed from rewarding to aversive (<a href=\"#bib70\">Pliakas et al., 2001</a>). Together, these data suggest that alterations in the activity and, subsequently, interactions between DA and dynorphin/KOR systems play a critical role in experience mediated plasticity in reward processing."

One hypothesized mechanism in which the dynorphin/KOR is thought to negatively impact motivation and reward processing is through its ability to robustly decrease dopaminergic transmission within the NAc (<a href=\"#bib81\">Shippenberg et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Carlezon and Thomas, 2009</a>). Interestingly, interactions between these systems were augmented following the establishment of a pair bond in male, but not female, prairie voles. Given that paired bonded males are the more aggressive sex and that paired males also incur greater reproductive costs if their mate engages in extra-pair copulations (<a href=\"#bib74\">Resendez et al., 2012</a>), it is possible that paired males show a greater aversion to social novelty and this enhanced aversion may be mediated by augmented coupling between DA and dynorphin/KORs within the NAc. While more work is necessary to determine the exact mechanism in which NAc KORs mediate the expression of sex differences in selective aggression, the present study nonetheless provides an interesting example of how the dynorphin/KOR system modulates reward and motivation to promote ethologically relevant behavioral adaptation."

Interestingly, there is compelling evidence that a preventative approach, focused on neural adaptations resulting from the formation and maintenance of positive social relationships, may offer positive benefits to psychological well being (<a href=\"#bib38\">Feldman, 2015</a>). For example, in drug-addicted humans, the presence of positive social support reduces the propensity for relapse (<a href=\"#bib29\">Creswell et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that positive social experience, such as bonding, may wire the brain in a manner that reduces future drug seeking behavior (<a href=\"#bib94\">Young et al., 2011</a>). Yet, despite the demonstrated positive benefit for social bonding on mental health, the neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between social bonding and drug taking have not been extensively studied. The scarcity of studies examining this relationship is likely related to a lack of animal models that exhibit both the propensity for social bonding and drug taking behavior."

Importantly, as demonstrated in the present study, the establishment of a pair bond, but not mere social exposure or mating, is required for social bonding to exert protective effects against AMPH reward. The specificity of the establishment of a social bond to the neural protection against drug reward is likely related to the fact that the establishment of a pair bond alters the brain in a manner in which other social experiences do not (<a href=\"#bib59\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Smith and Wang, 2014</a>). Indeed, it has previously been demonstrated that activation of neural systems that mediate pair bond maintenance (NAc D1-like receptors), but not those that mediate pair bond formation (NAc D2-like receptors), are required for pair bond induced protection against drug reward (<a href=\"#bib59\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). Here, we extended these previous findings by demonstrating that, for male prairie voles, activation of NAc shell KORs is required for pair bond induced attenuation of AMPH reward. Given that drugs that act at the dynorphin/KOR system are currently under intense investigation as potential therapeutics for the treatment of addiction (<a href=\"#bib16\">Carlezon and Miczek, 2010</a>) and that pair bonding induces neural plasticity within this system to result in an attenuation in drug reward, there may be considerable therapeutic value in understanding the neural mechanisms in which social experiences alter reward circuitry to buffer against drug reward. Finally, data presented in the present study also provide support for the consideration of socially related cognitive therapies when developing future treatment regimens for the treatment of addiction."

Given the presumption that a reduction in receptor number would also reduce the efficacy of an agonist to produce the measured physiological response, these findings appear to contradict one another. However, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRS), including KORs, are dynamic proteins that can adopt multiple conformational states, resulting in variability in ligand binding affinity as well as efficacy of the receptor to activate distinct downstream signaling cascades (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bruchas and Chavkin, 2010</a>). For example, G proteins have been shown to pre-couple with receptors (<a href=\"#bib65\">Nobles et al., 2005</a>) and this coupling can lead to conformational changes in the extracellular portion of the receptor that enhance affinity of the ligand for the receptor (<a href=\"#bib92\">Yan et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, the percent of G protein receptor coupling can vary as a function of receptor density (<a href=\"#bib92\">Yan et al., 2008</a>). Thus, under certain physiological conditions, it is possible for receptor coupling efficiencies to be enhanced, resulting in a fewer number of receptors to be required for an agonist to produce the maximal biological response (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kenakin, 2002</a>)."

Thus, there are wide variety of dynamic receptor states that can influence functional interactions between the ligand and the receptor as well as the receptor and its G protein. Future research is therefore necessary to determine if, in addition to pair bond induced changes in striatal KOR expression patterns, if KOR mediated signaling properties also vary as a function of social state as well as the potential for such alterations to influence DA transmission dynamics. Finally, given that KORs are found on the terminal regions of multiple inputs to the NAc (glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic) (<a href=\"#bib62\">Meshul and McGinty, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Svingos et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Hjelmstad and Fields, 2003</a>) more work will also be necessary to determine if KOR binding is globally decreased within the NAc of pair bonded males or if this decrease is restricted to a specific sub-population of inputs."

For FSCV experiments, both biological and technical replicates, i.e., repeated measurements from the same coronal slice under identical preparations were also made. To determine whether the data were normally distributed and equivalent in variance, we examined boxplots for each group. In cases where boxplots revealed that the data were not normally distributed or there was a lack of equal variance among groups, nonparametric tests were used.

Many more studies use the U compounds, thus the choice of BRL makes it more difficult to compare these findings with others. Because the vole kappa receptor is genetically distinct from rat and mouse, the agonist specificity of BRL needs to be verified by antagonist controls, and cannot be assumed. \"strangest effects expected to occur in the ventral striatum.\" is an unfortunate typo."

These behavioral and pharmacological studies are tied in with analysis of dopamine release in acute slices using fast scan cyclic voltammetry. Despite these impressive wide-ranging studies, no clear picture emerges as to how and where these two signaling systems interact to control pair bonding.

How is this to be reconciled? Similarly, KOR binding is reduced in pair bonded voles but activation of KOR reduces dopamine release in these voles. The most parsimonious explanation is that these signaling systems are regulating pair bonding at multiple points in the circuit and also regulating other behaviors. Until these are resolved I don't see how firm conclusions can be drawn."

The KOR agonist, BRL 5237, was chosen based on a previous study that utilized FSCV in striatal slice preparations collected from rats to examine KOR modulation of DA release within the NAc shell. This study identified a significant reduction in stimulated dopamine release following a 1\u03bcM bath application of BRL 5237 (Britt & McGehee, 2008). We included this dose, in addition to others, in our studies to show that a significant reduction in stimulated dopamine release within the nucleus shell of prairie voles required a much higher dose of this agonist. This study also utilized a KOR antagonist to show that the drug is specific to KOR receptors under these conditions. Although other studies since this publication have utilized the U50, 488 KOR agonist in combination with FSCV in striatal slice preparations, when we initially began our studies, many of these papers had not yet been published and we therefore chose the BRL 5237 KOR agonist to allow us to compare our results to other previously published findings. Additionally, in a previous publication, we conducted extensive behavioral pharmacological comparisons utilizing the U50,488 agonist to show that a much higher dose of the KOR antagonist, nor-BNI, was required to block the locomotor and analgesic effects produced by U50,488 in both male and female prairie voles. Thus, the necessity for higher doses of drugs that act at the KOR in this species is consistent across multiple pharmacological compounds as well as both in vivo and in vitro measures. Finally, although our genetic analysis shows that the prairie vole KOR differs from that of rats, mice, humans, as well as guinea pigs, it also shows that the prairie vole KOR is more similar to that of guinea pigs and humans than that of rats and mice. Importantly, the pharmacological compounds utilized in the present study have been shown to be specific in guinea pigs and humans despite having some differences in pharmacological properties of the drugs when compared to rats and mice. See the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cPair bonding alters KOR regulation of DA transmission in a sex-specific manner\u201d for the amino acids in which the prairie vole KOR differs from other species."

We interpret these results to indicate that any potential changes in the expression of these genes following pair bonding were not consistent across animals within a group. Finally, while larger sample sizes may be sufficient to detect these more variable effects, we note that the samples sizes used in the present study are more than adequate for this type of experiment, and also that the lack of change in these genes is in no way an essential component of this manuscript."

Differences in the shape of the concentration response curve may also reflect mechanistic differences in the binding of the drug and/or in activation of downstream signaling targets.

Resendez et al. have performed a series of studies to understand how signaling through D1-like dopamine receptor (Drd1-like) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) influence pair bonds under a variety of behavioral paradigms, including social familiarity preference, mate guarding, and buffering of preference for amphetamine. These behavioral and pharmacological studies are tied in with analysis of dopamine release in acute slices using fast scan cyclic voltammetry. Despite these impressive wide-ranging studies, no clear picture emerges as to how and where these two signaling systems interact to control pair bonding. This lack of mechanistic insight diminishes my enthusiasm.</i>"

Moreover, even in the case that a preference was formed for the unfamiliar social stimulus, this preference would still require that the familiar partner that was paired with KOR activation to be avoided. Finally, it is well established that animals will avoid stimuli that have previously been paired with an aversive experience and our study design employed similar conditioning procedures. Specifically, prior to pairing with a female partner, males were administered either aCSF or a KOR agonist into the NAc shell. After the one-hr pairing, males were then given the option to choose to spend time in contact with the familiar female partner or a novel stranger. Males who were administered a KOR agonist immediately prior to pairing avoided the female partner that had been paired with KOR activation suggesting that activation of KOR while in the presence of a social stimulus results in the stimulus to be encoded as aversive and avoided. This finding is similar to previous research showing that pairing an odorant with either stress or KOR activation can result in the avoidance of that odorant (Landet al., 2008)."

Although the data appear to be conflicting, much evidence supports that GPCRs are capable of behaving in a dynamic nature that can vary by ligand binding, receptor density, lipid membrane properties, G protein coupling, as well as the specific downstream signaling cascade that is engaged. While we agree that figuring the mechanism underlying how enhanced reduction of dopamine transmission occurs in pair bonded males despite this group also showing a reduction in KOR binding, this would require extensive amounts of follow up experiments that our beyond the main focus of this paper. Here, our main goal was to determine if interactions between D1-like receptors and KORs mediate the maintenance of monogamous social bonds and future experiments will be required to figure out the mechanism of this interaction. We have highlighted this issue in the Discussion section and added an additional section entitled, \u201cFuture considerations for how interactions between the D1-like dopamine receptor system and the dynorphin/KOR system mediate pair bond maintenance\u201d to address this important future area of research."
