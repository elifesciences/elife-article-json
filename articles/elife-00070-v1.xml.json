Levels of H2BE are heterogeneous among olfactory neurons, but stereotyped according to the identity of the co-expressed olfactory receptor (OR). Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that changes in <i>H2be</i> expression affect olfactory function and OR representation in the adult olfactory epithelium. We show that H2BE expression is reduced by sensory activity and that it promotes neuronal cell death, such that inactive olfactory neurons display higher levels of the variant and shorter life spans. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of H2BE differ from those of the canonical H2B, consistent with a role for H2BE in altering transcription. We propose a physiological function for <i>H2be</i> in modulating olfactory neuron population dynamics to adapt the OR repertoire to the environment."

Levels of H2BE are heterogeneous among olfactory neurons, but stereotyped according to the identity of the co-expressed olfactory receptor (OR). Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that changes in <i>H2be</i> expression affect olfactory function and OR representation in the adult olfactory epithelium. We show that H2BE expression is reduced by sensory activity and that it promotes neuronal cell death, such that inactive olfactory neurons display higher levels of the variant and shorter life spans. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of H2BE differ from those of the canonical H2B, consistent with a role for H2BE in altering transcription. We propose a physiological function for <i>H2be</i> in modulating olfactory neuron population dynamics to adapt the OR repertoire to the environment."

In general, sensory systems have to decipher only a limited collection of stimuli, but the olfactory system must be able to process information from thousands of distinct odors that are found in a given environment and which may vary dramatically from one environment to the next. Each odor-sensing neuron in the nose of a mammal contains just one kind of odorant receptor protein, although mammalian genomes typically encode 1000 or so different kinds of receptor proteins. This suggests that it might be possible to \u2018tune\u2019 the olfactory system to a particular environment by changing the relative numbers of the different types of neurons. Indeed, it is known that the relative abundance of each type of odor-sensing neuron changes with age and experience, and that these changes might be caused by variations in the lifespans of the neurons."

But how do experiences alter the levels of gene products to give rise to lasting changes in the brain? One hypothesis is that changes to a structure called chromatin are key to this process: chromatin is an assembly of DNA molecules, which are quite long, and organizing proteins, mostly proteins known as histones, that together form a compact structure that can fit inside the nucleus of a cell."

H2BE is a variant of a protein called H2B, which is a well-known histone. They found that in odor-sensing neurons, H2BE replaces H2B to an extent that depends on the amount of activity experienced by the neuron: H2BE is nearly undetectable in highly active neurons, but almost completely replaces H2B in neurons that are inactive. Moreover, genetic manipulation showed that the deletion of H2BE significantly extended the lifespan of neurons, whereas elevated levels of H2BE shortened their lifespan. These findings reveal an extraordinary process that involves inactive odor-sensing neurons being depleted relative to active ones over time."

One hint comes from evidence that these amino acids disrupt interactions between chromatin and \u2018effector\u2019 proteins, which modulate gene activity. Consistent with this, Santoro and Dulac have found that the replacement of H2B by H2BE strongly alters gene activity, although the precise mechanism by which these alterations regulate neuronal lifespans remains to be determined. Understanding this process in detail, and exploring if similar phenomena are involved in experience-dependent changes elsewhere in the nervous system, are fascinating areas of future research."

The MOE detects large arrays of chemical cues through the expression of a large family of olfactory receptor (OR) genes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buck and Axel, 1991</a>). Individual olfactory neurons express a single OR allele chosen through a largely stochastic process (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chess et al., 1994</a>). The olfactory epithelium of mammals displays continuous neurogenesis throughout adulthood, such that a slow dividing olfactory neural stem cell population continuously replaces mature olfactory neurons that have variable, though finite, life spans (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kondo et al., 2010</a>)."

Initial expression analyses revealed that <i>H2be</i> mRNA and protein levels are not uniform among olfactory neurons. Rather, neurons with variable expression levels appear intermingled, and apically-located neurons generally display the highest levels of expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A and 2B</a>). The heterogeneous expression of <i>H2be</i> among MOE neurons could potentially reflect differences in the identity of the co-expressed OR, in neuronal maturity, or in some unknown biological feature. To examine the relationship between <i>H2be</i> and OR expression, we used fluorescent ISH (FISH) to identify mature neurons expressing each of 42 specific OR genes. We then used quantitative fluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#bib59\">Waters, 2009</a>) (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) to assess the level of FLAG-H2BE within nuclei of the identified neurons relative to their surrounding neuronal field, imaged in tissue sections spanning the length of the MOE, and across multiple animals (<i>n</i> \u2265 2 per OR). Strikingly, each OR tested appears consistently and reproducibly associated with a stereotyped level of H2BE in mature neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). Indeed, for 73% of the tested ORs, neurons expressing the same OR display significantly less variation with each other in their H2BE level than is observed within the entire MOE neuronal population (p&lt;0.05 after false-discovery rate [FDR] correction; 1-tailed <i>F</i>-test). These results indicate that H2BE expression in a given neuron is tightly correlated with the identity of the co-expressed OR, and not with a specific stage of neuronal development or maturity."

To investigate the temporal onset of H2BE expression relative to OR gene choice, we took advantage of the basal to apical gradient of neuronal development in the MOE. Analysis of the onset of H2BE relative to ORs normally associated with high levels of H2BE revealed that H2BE expression is initiated well after OR expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We next compared the onset of <i>H2be</i> expression to that of <i>Neurod1</i>, <i>Gap43</i>, and <i>Omp</i>, which are expressed prior to, concurrently with, and subsequent to OR gene choice, respectively (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cau et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Iwema and Schwob, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kolterud et al., 2004</a>). We found that the onset of <i>H2be</i> expression follows the window of <i>Neurod1</i> expression, as observed at both the protein and RNA levels in MOE tissue from Flag-H2be and WT mice, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). Moreover, H2BE expression begins after GAP43 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) and before OMP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), but overlaps extensively with both. Together, these results confirm that H2BE is present prior to full neuronal maturity, but subsequent to OR choice. Thus H2BE is unlikely to participate in the process of OR choice."

Analysis of active-CASP3-labeled mature olfactory neurons in H2be-KO and littermate controls revealed a 45% lower frequency of apoptosis in the mutant epithelium (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Moreover, analysis of the life span of 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled neurons revealed a significantly higher survival rate in H2be-KO mice compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). These results indicate that the loss of <i>H2be</i> increases the life span of mature neurons. Accordingly, similar analyses in H2be-GF mice revealed a twofold higher rate of apoptosis among mature neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) and a significantly reduced survival rate compared to Flag-H2be mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Remarkably, the initial BrdU labeling frequency of H2be-GF neurons is approximately 2.9-fold higher than that observed in control neurons, reflecting an elevated rate of neurogenesis, presumably a consequence of the increased rate of apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). To ensure that the observed increase in apoptosis in transgenic epithelia is not due to a non-specific toxic effect of the overexpressed histone, we expressed <i>H2be</i> or <i>Flag-H2be</i> at high levels in cultured fibroblast (NIH-3T3) or embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) cells. Transgene-expressing cells showed no increase in cell death compared to control cells overexpressing the canonical <i>H2b</i> or containing no transgene (not shown), suggesting that H2BE's action in affecting cellular longevity requires an olfactory-specific cellular context. Taken together, these data indicate that the expression of <i>H2be</i> in mature olfactory neurons directly affects neuronal longevity, such that neurons with low expression of H2BE tend to have longer life spans, while neurons with elevated H2BE tend to be relatively short-lived."

High-resolution confocal imaging of neuronal nuclei in the MOE of Flag-H2be mice revealed that H2BE is not confined to nuclear puncta, but rather is widely distributed throughout the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13D</a>). Analysis of H2BE localization by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in MOE neurons confirmed its wide distribution and revealed a slight enrichment near gene promoters, especially in genes highly expressed in mature olfactory neurons (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13E</a>). Interestingly, these analyses and subsequent qPCR experiments revealed that the protein-coding regions of histone genes are particularly enriched for H2BE, while those of OR and vomeronasal receptor (VR) genes are relatively devoid of the variant (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13F\u2013H</a>). Because the ChIP input was obtained from a heterogeneous mixture of MOE nuclei and approximately 99.9% of OR alleles and all VR alleles are silent in a given olfactory neuron, the latter results may reflect the lower accessibility of silent OR and VR loci for replacement of canonical H2B by H2BE, perhaps due to the highly compacted nature of these loci (<a href=\"#bib33\">Magklara et al., 2011</a>). Together, our results support a model in which H2BE replacement of canonical H2B within olfactory chromatin is widespread, but most extensive within transcriptionally active loci."

Using an ELISA assay, we ruled out the possibility that the polyclonal antibody against H2B-Lys5-Me is incompatible with the H2BE sequence (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14C</a>). To determine if there is a causal link between the seemingly mutually exclusive expression of H2BE and H2B-Lys5-Me, we examined the prevalence of H2B-Lys5-Me in H2be-KO and H2be-GF mice. Remarkably, loss of <i>H2be</i> leads to widespread H2B-Lys5-Me immunoreactivity in H2be-KO MOEs (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14D</a>), while over-expression of H2BE further reduces H2B-Lys5-Me staining in H2BE-positive nuclei (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14E</a>). Western analysis of MOE lysates from Flag-H2be mice provided a biochemical confirmation that the Lys5-Me modification is absent from the tagged H2BE (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14F</a>). Together, our results suggest that, unlike canonical H2B, H2BE does not undergo detectable mono-methylation at Lys5 and that, consequently, replacement of H2B by H2BE causes a direct reduction of the Lys5-Me modification in H2BE expressing cells. Interestingly, we observe an increase in the number of H2BE expressing neurons, and in H2BE level in individual cells in the MOEs of older animals (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14G\u2013I</a>). This is supported by western analysis, which revealed that the overall level of H2BE in the MOE doubles from 7 weeks to 45 weeks (approximately 10 months) of age (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14J</a>). In addition, we observe that the mutual exclusion between H2BE and H2B-Lys5-Me dramatically increases with age (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14G\u2013I</a>), indicating the gradual replacement of canonical H2B by H2BE, which proceeds to near-completion in a fraction of neurons by 36 weeks (approximately 8.5 months) of age. Further, it suggests that the accumulation of H2BE through replacement of canonical H2B proceeds at a faster pace than it's loss through neuronal turnover."

Thus, the repertoire of expressed ORs in the MOE is determined by the combined probabilities associated with the choice of a specific OR by olfactory neuron precursors and the subsequent longevity of those neurons. OR gene choice has been shown to obey a largely stochastic process influenced by the genomic context of local enhancers (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mori and Sakano, 2011</a>). In contrast, olfactory life span appears variable and may be influenced by environmental factors such as pathogens and odorant stimulation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Watt et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kondo et al., 2010</a>). Our data uncover a chromatin-based pathway in which the absence of odor-evoked activity of specific MOE neuronal populations leads to increased H2BE expression, and in turn changes in transcription and reduced neuronal life span. In addition to a pro-apoptotic role of high levels of H2BE, we cannot exclude other roles for this olfactory-specific histone variant at low or moderate levels. Indeed our data indicate that neurons that are normally highly active and therefore express low levels of H2BE increase in abundance following olfactory deprivation, an effect that is diminished in H2be-KO mice. This result may be due to a compensatory increase of the low-H2BE expressing cells following olfactory deprivation, but could also indicate that a modest level of H2BE is optimal for neuronal longevity. In addition, our findings that changes in transcription and OR frequency following unilateral naris occlusion are significantly reduced but not eliminated in H2be-KO mice indicate that H2BE plays a key role in modulating activity dependent changes, but is likely part of a larger pathway."

Interestingly, a previous study showing enhanced longevity of odor-stimulated adenovirus-infected olfactory neurons implicated CREB as the mediator of this effect (<a href=\"#bib60\">Watt et al., 2004</a>). The absence of full CRE sites in the <i>H2be</i> gene does not permit the establishment of a direct functional link between the activity of a CREB family member such as ICER and H2BE levels at this point, but other indirect signaling pathways may exist. An alternative scenario would postulate the existence of a cAMP-regulated chaperone that exchanges canonical H2B and H2BE."

Such studies suggest the possibility that ligand-independent, OR-derived basal signaling may also contribute to the overall activity level in mature olfactory neurons, especially under laboratory housing conditions where the odor repertoire is minimal. This scenario would help explain the observation that loss of <i>Adcy3</i>, which eliminates both basal and odor-stimulated activity, appears to affect <i>H2be</i> levels more dramatically than olfactory deprivation through UNO, which is expected to only eliminate odor-evoked activity. Thus, along with odor-evoked activity, OR-derived basal activity may be a significant contributor to the control of H2BE levels and, in turn, of olfactory neuronal longevity."

Our analyses of relative PTM levels for H2BE and canonical H2B at a handful of known PTM sites suggest that incorporation of the variant could affect cellular transcription at least in part via differential post-translational modifiability. It must be acknowledged, however, that as is true for most histone PTMs, evidence that the PTMs affected by H2BE replacement play a role in transcription is merely correlative and therefore insufficient to support a strong functional prediction. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the idea that H2BE shortens neuronal life span via changes in cellular transcription and metabolism, likely over the time course of several days or weeks, although the precise mechanism for this process remains to be determined. Notably, although phosphorylation of H2B Ser14 has been associated with short trigger of apoptosis in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cheung et al., 2003</a>), we have not found evidence for involvement of H2BE in this pathway (not shown)."

A scenario thus emerges according to which neurons expressing ORs associated with environmentally salient odors are frequently active and may increase in relative abundance over time due to enhanced longevity, while neurons expressing infrequently activated ORs have a shortened life span, mediated in part by H2BE, and become less abundant (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). Differential longevity among olfactory sensory may provide an effective mechanism by which individuals with similar genomes adapt to diverse olfactory environments, facilitating enhanced sensitivity to odors important for survival. Accordingly, we observed significant impairment of olfactory learning behavior in H2be-KO mice, although it remains to be determined whether these defects are due to aberrant OR expression frequencies resulting from the lack of H2BE expression or, alternatively, to the altered expression of other genes involved in olfactory neuron signaling."

In an initial experiment, mice were challenged to discriminate between hexanol and hexanoic acid, and in a second experiment, were challenged with the two stereoisomers of carvone. Prior to the initial experiment, mice were trained to obtain water from two ports unconditionally (day 1), after first poking an odor port (days 2\u20135), after poking an odor port presenting isoamyl-acetate odor (days 6\u201313), and after only a single poke of an odor port presenting isoamyl-acetate odor (days 14\u201320).

H2BE is co-expressed with a subset of odorant receptors (ORs). Genetic loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses support the model that H2BE regulates the OR expression landscape by affecting the longevity of sensory neurons. These experiments provide compelling evidence for a novel and highly interesting phenomenon and its underlying mechanisms: lack of sensory activity over a period of weeks induces the expression of H2BE, which in turn promotes the elimination of less-used OR populations. This selection allows mice to optimize the OR repertoire for their environment. The findings are also exciting for the chromatin biology field, since only few histone variants have been studied so far in a biologically relevant context."

Indeed histones can be incorporated in the nucleosomes in a replication independent manner but we do not know if this happens in post-mitotic olfactory neurons. In the majority of the IFs presented here H2BE forms a distinct ring on the nuclear envelope with little signal on the nucleoplasm. Thus it is possible that the transgenic H2BE is expressed too late, differentiation-wise, and cannot be incorporated in nucleosomes as efficiently as the endogenous histone. The Chip analysis does not really alleviate this concern because it uses crosslinked chromatin. A simple answer to this question would be to generate native mononucleosomes from the olfactory epithelium and show that FLAG-H2BE is incorporated in these nucleosomes, or that it can be co-immunoprecipitated with histones H3 and H4 again from native nucleosomal preparations. The same should be also done with the OMP-driven transgene. Also the authors should provide some information on the relative levels of free vs nucleosomal FLAG-H2BE in each genotype (for example they can perform salt dialysis on OE nuclei \u2013 only free histones would be extracted)."

Since the biology described here is so interesting, it is better to omit preliminary or inconclusive mechanistic data and replace them with the supplemental figures from the olfactory bulb."

We have addressed this concern in multiple ways by demonstrating that (A) the transgenic and endogenous H2be genes display a similar expression onset and (B) NeuroD-positive progenitors do not yet express the endogenous H2be gene, which emerges at a later stage of olfactory neuronal differentiation. Finally, we offer a slightly different interpretation of the data in Nickell et al, which is fully compatible with our conclusions (C)"

The observation of occasional basally-located neurons in which <i>H2be</i> mRNA can be detected but FLAG-H2BE cannot is likely the expected result of a slight lag in protein production following the onset of <i>H2be</i> transcription in immature neurons. These results confirm previous expression data showing highly similar staining patterns for the FLAG-H2BE and endogenous <i>H2be</i> (e.g., Figure 1A and Figure 2B). Together with the RT-qPCR data showing identical RNA expression levels for the transgenic and endogenous alleles (Figure 2D), we believe that these data strongly suggest faithful recapitulation of endogenous <i>H2be</i> gene expression by the H2be:Flag-H2be transgene. Of note, we also performed the experiment suggested by the reviewers (crossing <i>the BAC transgenic to the mCherry knock-in allele and compare their expression pattern),</i> but have not included the data as the presence of membrane-bound mCherry in axons crossing the basal layer of the olfactory epithelium, in addition to the cell bodies, makes it impossible to obtain a clear cellular resolution of H2BE expression onset by immunostaining or intrinsic fluorescence."

A representative image of this experiment (newly included as Figure 6C) clearly demonstrates the complete absence of overlap between the expression patterns of the two mRNAs, strongly supporting our conclusion that the onset of <i>H2be</i> expression strictly follows and does not include the developmental window of <i>Neurod1</i> expression."

Indeed histones can be incorporated in the nucleosomes in a replication independent manner but we do not know if this happens in post-mitotic olfactory neurons. In the majority of the IFs presented here H2BE forms a distinct ring on the nuclear envelope with little signal on the nucleoplasm. Thus it is possible that the transgenic H2BE is expressed too late, differentiation-wise, and cannot be incorporated in nucleosomes as efficiently as the endogenous histone. The Chip analysis does not really alleviate this concern because it uses crosslinked chromatin. A simple answer to this question would be to generate native mononucleosomes from the olfactory epithelium and show that FLAG-H2BE is incorporated in these nucleosomes, or that it can be co-immunoprecipitated with histones H3 and H4 again from native nucleosomal preparations. The same should be also done with the OMP-driven transgene. Also the authors should provide some information on the relative levels of free vs nucleosomal FLAG-H2BE in each genotype (for example they can perform salt dialysis on OE nuclei \u2013 only free histones would be extracted)</i>."

There are two likely explanations for the appearance of a nuclear ring in some of our IF images: 1) olfactory neurons have a single or small number of large central chromocenters that are not stained with anti-FLAG antibodies, leading to the appearance of stronger staining on the nuclear periphery (for example, see Figure 13D). 2) The anti-FLAG antibody stains chromatin within the nuclear periphery more quickly than the euchromatin within the nuclear interior. This is particularly evident for MOE tissue from H2be-GF mice, where the level of Flag-H2be is much higher than in Flag-H2be mice (for example, Figure 14E). We have observed that more uniform staining throughout the nucleus is achieved with long antibody incubation times, indicating that the apparent peripheral staining is not due to concentration of FLAG-H2BE at the nuclear periphery."

With respect to the findings that H2BE receives dramatically reduced monomethylation at Lys5 compared to canonical H2B, we agree with the reviewers that the biological implication is presently unknown. Although this modification has been strongly correlated with active transcription in other cell systems (Barski et al. 2007, Cell <i>129,</i> 823-837; Wang et al. 2008, Nature Genetics <i>40,</i> 897-903), a causative association has not been established. Moreover, since we did not survey all possible H2B modifications, our understanding of H2BE\u2019s modification status is by no means complete. However, we are reluctant to entirely omit these data, as we believe that the finding represents an important proof of concept for potential functional differences between the two histones at the molecular level, which must be mediated by only five amino acid differences. We believe that the finding of reduced Lys5-Me modification serves as a platform for further investigations into the functional differences between the two molecules and possibly for understanding the biological function of the H2B-Lys5-Me modification. Thus, we wish to keep these data in the manuscript, but we have modified the text to emphasize that the finding is not an indication of mechanism."
