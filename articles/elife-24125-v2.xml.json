Here, we examined how solutes and macromolecules are separated when they exit the phloem during the unloading process. We used a combination of approaches (non-invasive imaging, 3D-electron microscopy, and mathematical modelling) to show that phloem unloading of solutes in Arabidopsis roots occurs through plasmodesmata by a combination of mass flow and diffusion (convective phloem unloading). During unloading, solutes and proteins are diverted into the phloem-pole pericycle, a tissue connected to the protophloem by a unique class of \u2018funnel plasmodesmata\u2019. While solutes are unloaded without restriction, large proteins are released through funnel plasmodesmata in discrete pulses, a phenomenon we refer to as \u2018batch unloading\u2019. Unlike solutes, these proteins remain restricted to the phloem-pole pericycle. Our data demonstrate a major role for the phloem-pole pericycle in regulating phloem unloading in roots."

Here, we examined how solutes and macromolecules are separated when they exit the phloem during the unloading process. We used a combination of approaches (non-invasive imaging, 3D-electron microscopy, and mathematical modelling) to show that phloem unloading of solutes in Arabidopsis roots occurs through plasmodesmata by a combination of mass flow and diffusion (convective phloem unloading). During unloading, solutes and proteins are diverted into the phloem-pole pericycle, a tissue connected to the protophloem by a unique class of \u2018funnel plasmodesmata\u2019. While solutes are unloaded without restriction, large proteins are released through funnel plasmodesmata in discrete pulses, a phenomenon we refer to as \u2018batch unloading\u2019. Unlike solutes, these proteins remain restricted to the phloem-pole pericycle. Our data demonstrate a major role for the phloem-pole pericycle in regulating phloem unloading in roots."

Modern agriculture aims to maximize the amounts of carbon-based products allocated to storage organs such as grains and tubers, structures that act as carbon \u2018sinks\u2019 for the assimilates delivered by the phloem. The process by which solutes exit the phloem is termed phloem unloading, and is a central target for regulating the flux of carbon into sink tissues (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ham and Lucas, 2014</a>). In addition to assimilates, phloem sap also contains numerous proteins and RNAs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kehr, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Atkins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Batailler et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Turnbull and Lopez-Cobollo, 2013</a>). Unloading must therefore combine the seemingly antagonist functions of high selectivity with large permeability in order to allocate assimilates to growth zones while controlling the movement of macromolecules. The mechanisms that enable the precise and coordinated unloading of phloem-mobile compounds remain unknown."

Ontogenetically related, metabolically active companion cells (CCs) support the adjacent enucleate SEs throughout their lifespan (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lucas et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Pritchard, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">van Bel and Knoblauch, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lalonde et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Otero and Helariutta, 2017</a>). The pressure flow model of phloem transport, originally proposed by <a href=\"#bib42\">M\u00fcnch (1930)</a>, envisages that an osmotically generated pressure differential drives the\u00a0bulk flow through the SEs that connect photosynthetic tissues (sources) with those in which carbon consumption occurs (sinks). The loading of solutes in source tissues results in a high osmotic potential within SEs. The reduction of turgor pressure in sink organs due to carbon consumption leads to a pressure gradient that provides the energy to overcome viscous resistance within the SEs, resulting in a passive phloem flow from source to sink (<a href=\"#bib42\">M\u00fcnch, 1930</a>). Phloem sap collected from excised aphid stylets contains a complex mixture of macromolecules and low-molecular weight solutes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Atkins et al., 2011</a>). In a recent study, <a href=\"#bib51\">Paultre et al. (2016)</a> showed that many proteins, including those with targeting sequences, can move across a graft union and be unloaded near the root tip. Significantly, these proteins entered a post-phloem domain beyond which their movement was restricted. This observation begs the question as to how the phloem is able to discriminate between macromolecules and solutes during unloading. Besides the central function in resource allocation, it is now well established that the phloem also serves as network for transmission of chemical (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kramer and Boyer, 1995a</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mullendore et al., 2015</a>) and electrical (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hedrich et al., 2016</a>) signals."

Due to cell division and growth in the apical region of the root the demand for assimilates is high. Protophloem sieve elements (PSEs) become mature in such regions to accommodate this demand while the neighboring cells are still differentiating (<a href=\"#bib22\">Furuta et al., 2014</a>). Because PSEs lose their nucleus, they cannot divide to keep pace with the growth of the neighboring cells. Therefore, they become increasingly elongated until they become inactive in transport and eventually obliterated (<a href=\"#bib15\">Erwin and Evert, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eleftheriou and Tsekos, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Furuta et al., 2014</a>). In the elongation zone of the root, solutes are transferred laterally from the metaphloem SEs (MSEs) to the PSEs, allowing phloem continuity between source and sink tissues (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stadler et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Winter et al., 1992</a>)."

A central element of this model is that a low pressure gradient occurs along the flow path, with a steep drop in pressure between the PSEs and surrounding cells in the phloem unloading zone. In this scenario, allocation of carbon is controlled by the lateral hydraulic conductance in the unloading zone. Recent phloem turgor measurements in morning glory, however, did not support this model, as the bulk of the pressure is consumed by friction within the SEs, and only small pressure gradients are available for unloading (<a href=\"#bib32\">Knoblauch et al., 2016</a>). The <a href=\"#bib19\">Fisher (2000)</a> model also does not explain how both small solutes and macromolecules can leave the phloem simultaneously. <a href=\"#bib51\">Paultre et al., 2016</a> suggested recently that the removal of mobile proteins into a post-phloem domain may be necessary to prevent the terminal PSEs from becoming occluded, an event that would lead to dissipation of the turgor gradient between source and sink. Unfortunately, many of the factors that determine phloem unloading are not well studied. This is because the phloem in most sinks is difficult to access as it is embedded in an opaque layer of tissue. Phloem transport ceases immediately when the source is detached from the sink. Therefore, the function of the phloem can only be studied in situ, requiring new approaches for dissecting the factors that regulate phloem unloading."

We combined a detailed ultrastructural analysis of the cellular interfaces in the phloem unloading zone with the kinetics of phloem unloading of fluorescent solutes and macromolecules obtained by real-time imaging of growing roots. This analysis allowed us to derive new quantitative data on the factors that regulate phloem unloading in Arabidopsis. We report on the presence of a unique class of \u2018funnel plasmodesmata\u2019 that are involved specifically in the unloading of molecules into the phloem-pole pericycle. We show, by mathematical modelling, that phloem unloading of small solutes from PSEs is convective, i.e. it occurs continuously by a combination of mass flow and diffusion. In contrast, we find that macromolecules are unloaded in discrete pulses, a phenomenon we refer to as \u2018batch unloading\u2019. These macromolecules are diverted specifically into the two phloem-pole pericycle cells that abut each PSE where they are filtered out from the unloaded solutes."

Published images of phloem unloading in Arabidopsis give the impression that the unloading zone is a relatively broad region (<a href=\"#bib44\">Oparka et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wright and Oparka, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Knoblauch et al., 2015</a>). However, such images represent a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of unloading, taken at a defined time point following the application of fluorescent solutes to the leaf. Carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) is the most widely utilized phloem-mobile probe (<a href=\"#bib44\">Oparka et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wright and Oparka, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Knoblauch and van Bel, 1998</a>). This probe is non-fluorescent when applied to source leaves but is subsequently cleaved by endogenous esterases to produce fluorescent, membrane-impermeant, carboxyfluorescein (CF; <a href=\"#bib35\">Knoblauch et al., 2015</a>). The dye travels with the phloem translocation stream to sink tissues, where it can be visualized (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). When studied in real time, the dye characteristically shows preferential movement outwards into the cortex relative to the stele (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib44\">Oparka et al., 1994</a>). Unloading of the dye in the root tip indicates a symplastic (plasmodesmata-mediated) pathway (<a href=\"#bib44\">Oparka et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wright and Oparka, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Knoblauch et al., 2015</a>). The cells in the unloading zone sequester the dye rapidly into their vacuoles where it becomes trapped. This results in an increasing fluorescence within cells over time (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wright and Oparka, 1996</a>). Due to root growth, the cells initially involved in unloading move out of the phloem-unloading zone basipetally, but maintain their fluorescence due to the presence of dye in their vacuoles. Therefore, the apparent unloading zone broadens over time as root growth progresses, obscuring the current site of unloading. We therefore sought to define precisely the dimensions of the true phloem-unloading zone."

We loaded source leaves of this line with esculin and acquired time-lapse movies of unloading in the terminal PSEs.

These cells still had a fully intact nuclear membrane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

In this study, we photobleached CF after it had arrived in the phloem unloading zone of the root. In a tube of constant diameter and impermeable walls, the flow velocity is constant. When the walls become leaky, the flow velocity decreases because of loss of fluid. In the case of the protophloem, the tube becomes leaky when unloading occurs. To define the size of the unloading zone, we measured flow velocity along the phloem files and found that deceleration started at about 300\u2013400 \u00b5m behind PSE zero (this dimension varied slightly, even within the two sieve tube files in the same root tip; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Our data revealed that the phloem of the root is subdivided into distinct structural and functional domains. Translocation into the main root occurs through the metaphloem.

                                "text": "To monitor the fate of different phloem cargos, we compared the phloem-unloading pathway of small fluorescent probes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Knoblauch et al., 2015</a>) with fluorescent fusion proteins (<a href=\"#bib20\">Froelich et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Stadler et al., 2005</a>), covering a molecular mass range of 340 Da to more than 100 kDa. Experiments were conducted in situ on living roots. As shown before, small probes were unloaded laterally towards the cortex and subsequently distributed amongst all root cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Large probes of CC origin, however, were restricted to a specific domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). We wished to determine if proteins synthesized within SEs, rather than CCs, would show a similar pattern of unloading. Accordingly, we generated a transgenic Arabidopsis line expressing the Sieve Element Occlusion Related (SEOR) protein (<a href=\"#bib20\">Froelich et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">P\u00e9lissier et al., 2008</a>) fused to YFP (SEOR-YFP). This protein is generated exclusively in young sieve elements and remains a structural component after maturation of the cell and its integration into the translocating sieve tube file. We crossed this line with a second reporter line in which HDEL-GFP was targeted to the ER (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Both these fluorescent fusions were generated under the sieve-element specific promoters pSEOR; pMtSEO2. The promoters are active in young sieve elements only, but the gene products remain as structural components in mature sieve tubes (<a href=\"#bib54\">P\u00e9lissier et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Froelich et al., 2011</a>). GFP demarcated clearly the ER of the PSEs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). Unlike HDEL-GFP, the signal from the SEOR-YFP fusion (112 kDa), which is expressed in the cytoplasm of immature SEs, was not restricted to SEs but entered two specific cell files significantly larger than the adjacent PSEs, and did not travel outward beyond this domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We used resin embedding of the phloem-unloading zone (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bell et al., 2013</a>) to localize the YFP signal in transverse sections of the root. The YFP signal was confined to the two large PPP cells that abut the PSE files (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and E</a>). Time-lapse movies of the phloem unloading zone supported this observation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F and G</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Initially, SEOR-YFP was detected only in the immature PSEs as small aggregates. Subsequently, groups of new PPP cells became fluorescent adjacent to the PSEs, presumably when PD connections opened up between the two cell types (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F and G</a>). Using a fluorescent marker for CC nuclei (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>) we were unable to detect phloem unloading of SEOR-YFP into CCs, only into the PPP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,I</a>). This result was unexpected as most models of phloem unloading assume that the exit\u00a0of macromolecules occurs through CCs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Patrick, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Thorne, 1985</a>)."

Time-lapse movies revealed that unloading of large probes (GFP 27 kDa and above) did not occur at a constant rate, as observed with small solutes. Rather, these proteins were suddenly released into the adjoining PPP cells in distinct pulses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). We refer to this phenomenon as \u2018batch unloading\u2019, as the proteins are delivered in discrete pulses into individual cells. These cells then became highly fluorescent relative to their neighbors. Batch unloading did not occur at the same time into all cells, but independently into individual cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). It appears that specific domains exist in the root tip that confer a size-dependent filtration of the macromolecules that arrive in the unloading zone. Small proteins such as GFP were batch unloaded and subsequently moved freely throughout the root (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013F</a>). However, large probes such as aequorin-GFP and SEOR-YFP became trapped inside the PPP after batch unloading (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013J</a>)."

                                "text": "To further test the role of the PPP in phloem unloading we inhibited the lateral movement of solutes into this cell layer using an inducible callose synthase system (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vat\u00e9n et al., 2011</a>). In this approach a modified, PD-specific, callose synthase (<i>icals3m</i>) is induced under estradiol treatment, inhibiting cell-cell movement into the induced cell layer of the root (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vat\u00e9n et al., 2011</a>). In Arabidopsis there are twelve CalS proteins, with diverse roles in callose production (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen and Kim, 2009</a>). During the course of this study, we found that CalS8 is expressed specifically in the PPP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), allowing us to generate an estradiol-inducible line expressing <i>icals3m</i> under the CalS8 promoter (<i>pCALS8::icals3m</i>). This line was generated specifically to block the connection between PSEs and the PPP. After callose induction we observed a significant arrest in primary root growth relative to roots that were transferred to a non-inducing medium (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Next we labelled the cotyledons of induced and non-induced <i>pCALS8::icals3m</i> roots with CF at 8 hr and 24 hr after callose induction. Control roots showed the characteristic unloading pattern of wild-type plants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, n\u00a0=\u00a022) while induced plants showed a severe restriction in phloem unloading. At 8 hr induction, CF was restricted to PSE files with minimal lateral unloading into the root (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, n\u00a0=\u00a020). At 24 hr induction, this effect was even stronger. CF did not enter the unloading zone and remained completely restricted to PSEs distal to the unloading zone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, n\u00a0=\u00a09). To determine the potential role played by CCs in phloem unloading, we used the <i>sister of apple</i> (<i>sAPL</i>) promoter to drive the production of the mutant CALS3 protein (<i>psAPL::icals3m</i>). We chose this promoter as other CC-specific promoters (e.g. <i>SUC2</i>) were expressed only weakly within the phloem-unloading zone (data not shown). Within the phloem unloading zone the psAPL promoter was expressed strongly in CCs and MSE, but not in the PPP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,G</a>). As above, CF transport in these seedlings was monitored at 8 hr and 24 hr after estradiol induction. At both time points CF was unloaded without restriction, and induced and non-induced seedlings showed an identical pattern of unloading (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H\u2013J</a>, n\u00a0=\u00a03, n\u00a0=\u00a03, n\u00a0=\u00a02, respectively). Furthermore, we found that callose induction in the <i>psAPL::icals3m</i> seedlings did not significantly affect root growth relative to the uninduced control plants (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To confirm that callose synthase was overexpressed in the predicted cell layers, roots were fixed, embedded and stained for callose after the CF transport assays. Control roots showed the characteristic callose labelling associated with PSE files (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Confocal imaging of <i>pCALS8::icals3m</i> seedlings confirmed that callose was deposited strongly in the PPP relative to other cells surrounding the PSE files (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L\u2013O</a>), while <i>psAPL::icals3m</i> roots showed strong callose labelling in the CC files, as predicted (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 6P\u2013S</a>). Collectively, these data provide strong evidence that phloem unloading occurs predominantly via the PPP, not CCs, and suggest that the PD between PSE and PPP are central players in the unloading process."

Using this method, we collected 2100 serial transverse sections that spanned six complete SEs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), including the junction between PSE zero and the adjacent immature PSE (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). During reconstruction, we attributed the exact position of each PD to the different wall interfaces shared by the PSE, color-coded to ease identification (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Using 3D reconstruction, we could image PD on both the outer (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) and inner (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>) walls of the PSE files. A movie showing a \u2018fly through\u2019 of the interior of the PSE file is shown in <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>. PD relative distribution was 45.3%, 40.8%, and 13.9% between PSE-PPPs, PSE-CCs, and PSE-MSE, respectively, when corrected for the total interface between the cell types. Thus, PD leading from the PSE to PPP and CCs are equally abundant while those to the MSE are significantly lower. Next, we acquired data for the total numbers of PD along the entire phloem-unloading zone. We found that the total number averaged 527\u00a0\u00b1\u00a058 (n\u00a0=\u00a04) per protophloem unloading domain (since Arabidopsis roots are diarch, twice the number is available for unloading within the entire root tip). Based on the percentage distributions of PD obtained using serial sectioning, we calculated that in the phloem-unloading zone of the root there are approximately 240 plasmodesmata at the PSE-PPP interface, 215 plasmodesmata at the PSE-CC interface, and 73 plasmodesmata at the PSE-MP interface potentially available for unloading."

Recently, direct sieve tube pressure, viscosity, flow velocity, and tube geometry measurements in morning glory showed, however, that the majority of energy provided by the pressure differential between source and sink is consumed to drive flow, and that a high pressure differential in the root system is unlikely to exist, calling the current model into question (<a href=\"#bib32\">Knoblauch et al., 2016</a>). In principle, there are two possibilities of how the phloem sap might escape the PSEs. Bulk flow could move the entire volume of solvent and solutes through the PD into neighboring cells. Alternatively, the solutes could diffuse through PD while the solvent (water) could be removed from PSEs via membrane leakage, potentially via aquaporins (<a href=\"#bib13\">Doering-Saad et al., 2002</a>). Finally, a combination of diffusion and bulk flow could account for the observed transport."

The solutes must leave the phloem through the PD, while some of the solvent (water) may be removed via membrane leakage. To facilitate transport, an average of 240 PD are available at the PSE/PPP interface, while the water may leak anywhere along the 350 \u00b5m-length of the unloading zone. For simple PD we assumed a cylinder of constant dimensions with a desmotubule of 15 nm diameter and a cytoplasmic sleeve width of 2.8 nm, corresponding to the hydrodynamic radius of GFP. Based on our observations that GFP is batch unloaded, but diffuses relatively freely throughout the root, this molecule appears to be slightly larger than the size exclusion limit imposed by the neck region of funnel PD. For funnel PD we assumed the same dimensions on the PPP side but an average funnel opening of 150 nm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) towards the PSE. The location of the desmotubule in funnel PDs impacts the resistance which led us to assume two extremes which are discussed in detail in the appendix. The cell wall thickness (length of the simple and funnel PDs) was taken to be 500 nm."

We found that the required pressure differential to drive unloading solely by bulk flow through simple PD would be 8.14 MPa (see Appendix for detailed calculations). This pressure differential has neither been measured in SEs, nor can it be considered as feasible. However, assuming funnel PD instead of simple PD, the required pressure would be as low as 0.05\u20130.2 MPa. Such a relatively low pressure differential would be facile to maintain between plant cells. Because the viscous resistance in wide pores is greatly reduced (Appendix), funnel PD are much more efficient in unloading compared to simple PD."

Bulk flow would require a pressure differential of about 0.05\u20130.2 MPa, equal to an osmotic potential difference of about 20\u201380 mM. Solute unloading by diffusion alone, on the other hand, would require a concentration difference of 276 mM. While bulk flow predominates, the above mechanisms are not exclusive, and both may contribute to unloading. Bulk flow requires a pressure differential generated by osmosis which would lead to a concentration difference between PSEs and PPPs. This would induce diffusion, in parallel with bulk flow, even if its contribution is lower. The term for the combination of diffusion and bulk flow is convection, which leads us to propose a new model of Convective Phloem Unloading."

                                "text": "Many proteins have been found in extracted phloem sap, most showing no obvious function in long-distance signaling (<a href=\"#bib64\">Turnbull and Lopez-Cobollo, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Batailler et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Paultre, et al., 2016</a>). Thus, the question arises as to how many of these molecules are components of the phloem sap by default rather than by design (<a href=\"#bib51\">Paultre, et al., 2016</a>). To address this point we need to consider where such macromolecules originate. Many systemic macromolecules are thought to arise in CCs and pass into SEs through the pore-PD that connect SEs with CCs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fisher et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lucas et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sjolund, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Oparka and Turgeon, 1999</a>). There appears to be selectivity to this movement, large proteins (above 70 kDa) are restricted from entering the translocation stream while those below this cutoff are not (<a href=\"#bib51\">Paultre, et al., 2016</a>). Interestingly, in our current study SEOR-YFP (112 kDa), which is translated in immature SEs rather than CCs, was able to unload into the PPP, suggesting that the size exclusion limit that regulates macromolecular exchange between PPP and SE in sinks may be larger than between SEs and CCs in source phloem tissues. Another potential origin of macromolecules in phloem sap is young developing sieve elements. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, PSEs start to conduct when their nucleus degenerates. At this point the cytoplasmic content in the PSEs is still very dense. After integration into the mature PSE file, there is no other route left for degraded structures but phloem unloading, most likely into the PPP. Unlike the xylem pole pericycle (XPP), which is involved in lateral-root formation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Parizot et al., 2012</a>) and apoplastic xylem loading (<a href=\"#bib59\">Takano et al., 2002</a>), a specific role for the PPP has not been proposed, although its transcriptome shares similarity to the underlying protophloem (<a href=\"#bib48\">Parizot et al., 2012</a>). We have now identified the \u2018post-phloem domain\u2019 previously described by <a href=\"#bib57\">Stadler et al. (2005)</a> and <a href=\"#bib51\">Paultre, et al., 2016</a> as the PPP. It appears that while the XPP may be involved in apoplastic xylem loading, the PPP is intimately involved in symplastic phloem unloading, and may function as a repository for degraded PSE contents as well as systemic macromolecules. Although PD connect all cell types surrounding the PSEs, our data suggest that exit via the PPP is the major route of unloading in Arabidopsis roots. In mature source tissues, as well as in secondary sieve elements produced by the cambium, macromolecules will arrive in the phloem-unloading zone. This was demonstrated when we grafted SEOR-YFP scions onto wild-type rootstocks (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I,J</a>). Without continuous macromolecule unloading, PSEs would fill up rapidly and phloem unloading would be impaired (<a href=\"#bib51\">Paultre, et al., 2016</a>). PPPs are the major recipients of systemic macromolecules and it might be expected that they are specialized for the degradation of proteins and RNAs, an interesting area for future research. PPPs may also protect the downstream cells from receiving unwanted, potentially interfering mRNA molecules."

One possibility is that unloaded macromolecules destined to traffic further than the PPP may have specific sequences that interact with the PD that connect the PPP to the endodermis and beyond. Phloem-mobile viruses are able to move beyond the PPP suggesting that they can break the \u2018barrier\u2019 normally imposed by the PPP (<a href=\"#bib65\">Valentine et al., 2004</a>). A clear future challenge will be to identify systemic macromolecules that can move beyond the PPP, and to analyze these macromolecules for specific motifs that, like transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib70\">Xu et al., 2011</a>), allow them to interact with and modify PD."

Images were acquired with a FEG-SEM Quanta 250 (FEI, Hillsboro, OR), using a backscattered electron detector (Gatan Inc.). The block faces were sectioned at 40 nm increments. The images were initially processed and segmented using Microscopy Image Browser, a self-developed program written under Matlab environment (Mathworks Inc.) and available at <a href=\"http://mib.helsinki.fi/.\">http://mib.helsinki.fi/.</a> A SBFSEM dataset of 2100 images was subsequently segmented and visualized in 3D using Amira 6.0 software (FEI Corp). The outer structure cell walls were discriminated in a hybrid method of interpolated interactive masking and grey-level segmentation. The individual plasmodesmata were identified and segmented sequentially by a manual interactive method and color-coded into groups that related to the particular cell wall interface along the protophloem files."

Roots were then dissected and mounted in a 1:1 solution of AF1 antifadent (Citifluor) and 67 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> buffer, and subsequently imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM700). Following Sirofluor staining, roots were fixed for subsequent immunolocalization on cross sections in a fixative solution containing 4% formaldehyde (freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde powder, Sigma) and 0.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) in a 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffer pH7. Fixation, dehydration and resin infiltration steps were done in a micro-wave using a PELCO BioWave Pro (Ted Pella, Redding, CA). Fixation was achieved at 150\u00a0W, under vacuum (20\u00a0Hg) and for 6 min (2\u2019. Followed by a 2\u2019break and a final 2\u2019 microwave).

Resin infiltration (LR White medium grade, Agar scientific) was achieved through increasing resin concentrations: 33% resin in ethanol 100%, 66% resin in ethanol 100%, and 3 times 100% resin (20\u00a0Hg, MW 200\u00a0W 2\u2019 on \u2013 2\u2019 break \u2013 2\u2019 on). Polymerization was conducted overnight at 60\u00b0C. Semi-thin sections (0.5 \u00b5m) were taken with a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome.

Next, the pressure differential required to drive unloading through funnel PD is evaluated. Finally, we discuss the role of diffusive transport through through both simple and funnel PD, and aquaporin-mediated unloading of water. From these results, we deduce the most probable mode of phloem unloading able to account for our experimental observations."

This manuscript addresses (and answers) a major question that arose from a previous manuscript of this (now extended) consortium which was published in <i>eLife</i> last year: how is phloem unloading achieved if the pressure gradient between the phloem and the surrounding tissue in sinks is low and the high-pressure manifold model that was believed to be working in roots does not work. Additionally, the authors found that phloem unloading occurs in a specialized cell type which is different from the tissue that was \u2013 so far \u2013 thought to be the major player in this context. An interesting consequence from this paper is also that it shows that possibly/likely many of the macromolecules, a very \"hot\" topic that is currently discussed controversially, found in the phloem represent \"garbage\" rather than signaling molecules. Last not least: I spent a while going through the literature: This is the first study that provides data on the anatomy and (sub)cellular organization of the unloading zone which led to the discovery of a new type of plasmodesmata (PD)."

The authors use fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to measure phloem velocity and observe a reduction in this velocity in the phloem unloading zone. Using the first PSE identified as PSE-zero as a marker for the end of the unloading zone and flow rate reduction as a precise measure of phloem unloading the authors are able to precisely define the extent of the phloem unloading domain. A significant achievement. Strong evidence is presented using fluorescently tagged proteins and confocal imaging that proteins are unloaded in 'batches' and not as a steady stream. Furthermore, using cell-type specific expression of callose synthase the authors establish that unloading from the PSEs occurs into the phloem pole pericycle cells (PPP) and not into the companion cells (CC) as previously proposed. To further investigate the involvement of plasmodesmata (PD) in unloading from the PSEs into the PPP an in depth investigation using serial block-face scanning EM with 3D reconstruction is undertaken. This produces an incredible reconstruction of a file of PSEs and detailed structural information about PD that reveals a new type of 'funnel' PD that connect the PSEs and PPP. This is an exciting discovery. Modelling of phloem unloading is then used to predict that these new funnel PD provide a much more efficient pathway for phloem unloading, which presents a nice potential rational for the existence of such PD."

Imaging supports the idea that phloem pole pericycle (PPP) is a predominant pathway of phloem unloading, rather than companion cells (CCs), supported by the artificial PD closure by callose deposition. Additionally, they also show that most PD interconnecting the protophloem sieve elements (PSEs) and neighboring PPP are shaped like a funnel, which could enable unloading with lower pressure differential between PSE and PPP. Furthermore, they indicate that, during unloading process, large macromolecules are trapped by PPP and restricted in further movement, whereas small solutes are unloaded through PPP and more freely move throughout the root tip, suggesting that PPP may regulate unloading process depending on molecular size, and act as a repository for unloaded macromolecules. Thus, in this study, authors reveal that PPP and its funnel PD act as central players in phloem unloading, which will adds to the regulatory mechanism of phloem unloading and PD function depending on their diverse structures."

In the recent study by Paultre et al., 2016, it was shown that a host of native fusion proteins leave the terminal protophloem sieve elements and enter a unique \u2018post-phloem domain\u2019, identified in the current manuscript as the phloem-pole pericycle. These authors also used fusion proteins with organelle- targeting sequences and so our observations of protein exit from the protophloem are not just restricted to the three fusion proteins reported here."

This is the case for all probes of the size of GFP and larger. We provide examples in the form of a figure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and two videos (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">4</a>) which represent the extremes we tested (GFP, 27 kDa and SEOR-YFP 112 kDa). We have numerous videos with other probes (Aequorin GFP, Ubiquitin-GFP etc.), but we do not see a benefit in overloading the figure or adding more videos that basically show the same phenomenon. However, we have mentioned the additional fusion proteins that we tested in the text."

We used the suggested line for our batch unloading studies (pAtSUC2-GFP), but unfortunately it does not provide the results. GFP is constantly supplied to the sieve tube from the companion cells in the metaphloem and in the secondary phloem. Therefore we cannot discriminate between GFP that potentially leaks from protophloem CCs from GFP that is delivered to the root tip from metaphloem CCs. In order to make this experiment as the reviewers suggest, we should engineer a line which is expressing GFP in a CC-specific manner in the protophloem of the unloading zone only. Currently we don\u2019t have such line and establishing such line will go beyond the two-month revision time frame."
