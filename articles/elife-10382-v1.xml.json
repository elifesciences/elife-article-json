Using transgenic mice in which channelrhdopsin-2 is selectively expressed in cholinergic neurons, we show that optical stimulation of cholinergic inputs to the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) activates local GABAergic neurons to promote sleep and protect non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. It does not affect REM sleep. Instead, direct activation of cholinergic input to the TRN shortens the time to sleep onset and generates spindle oscillations that correlate with NREM sleep. It does so by evoking excitatory postsynaptic currents via \u03b17-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and inducing bursts of action potentials in local GABAergic neurons. These findings stand in sharp contrast to previous reports of cholinergic activity driving arousal. Our results provide new insight into the mechanisms controlling sleep."

Using transgenic mice in which channelrhdopsin-2 is selectively expressed in cholinergic neurons, we show that optical stimulation of cholinergic inputs to the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) activates local GABAergic neurons to promote sleep and protect non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. It does not affect REM sleep. Instead, direct activation of cholinergic input to the TRN shortens the time to sleep onset and generates spindle oscillations that correlate with NREM sleep. It does so by evoking excitatory postsynaptic currents via \u03b17-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and inducing bursts of action potentials in local GABAergic neurons. These findings stand in sharp contrast to previous reports of cholinergic activity driving arousal. Our results provide new insight into the mechanisms controlling sleep."

This collection of nerve cells has also been implicated in the process of waking up from sleep. However, it remains unclear how the cholinergic system acts on sleep."

The resulting increase in GABAergic activity in the TRN shortens sleep onset time and extends NREM sleep duration. These unexpected findings are quite different from those previously reported for cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and brainstem, which support arousal and REM sleep. The present results indicate that cholinergic projections to the TRN normally promote sleep onset and protect NREM sleep. The behavioral outcome of cholinergic activity across brain regions, therefore, depends on the combination of pathways activated and targets stimulated."

A 473 nm laser was employed to activate the cholinergic fibers through a 200 \u03bcm optical fiber (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Histological imaging showed that the optical fiber was well implanted above the TRN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We then tested EEG from the skull in vivo and found that optical stimulation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN could induce spindle oscillations both in waking and sleep states. To determine which stimulation intensity was most effective for inducing spindle oscillations, we used four intensities of 20 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms, and 400 ms pulses, respectively. The visual inspection revealed increasing EEG power with increasing stimulation intensity. However, when the pulse intensity increased to 200 ms, the EEG power nearly reached the maximum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We also compared the spindle co-occurrence evoked by 20 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms, and 400 ms, respectively, during awake and NREM states. The co-occurrence of spindle oscillation was greater than that in the waking stage (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Furthermore, spindle co-occurrence increased as the pulse duration increased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, there was no significant difference in co-occurrence between the 200 ms and 400 ms stimulation pulse-evoked spindle oscillations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Next, we compared the evoked and natural spindle oscillations and found there was no significant difference in their frequencies, amplitudes or durations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These results demonstrate that the evoked spindle oscillation pattern mimicked the natural spindle oscillation pattern."

The stimulation protocol applied 473 nm light (1.5 mW) for a 200-ms pulse at 6\u2009s intervals for 1\u2009hr, starting 4\u2009hr after 'light off' (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). After screening a range of conditions, this protocol appeared optimal and mimicked natural activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Combined EEG, EMG, and video recordings were used to determine the sleep-waking patterns and to examine sleep architecture (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lupi et al., 2008</a>). The stimulation protocol induced sleep onset in <i>ChAT-ChR2</i> mice (ChAT-ChR2-Sti) within 16\u2009min, on average (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>). This was 50\u201360% quicker (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) than in <i>ChAT-ChR2</i> mice without stimulation (ChAT-ChR2-NonSti) and in WT mice with stimulation (WT-Sti). There was no significant difference between WT-Sti mice and <i>ChAT-ChR2</i>-NonSti mice (<i>P</i> = 0.49). These results suggest that the shortened sleep onset was mediated by ChR2-induced activation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN. Correspondingly, the total sleep time of <i>ChAT-ChR2</i>-Sti mice stimulated for 1\u2009hr increased significantly compared with that of both <i>ChAT-ChR2</i>-NonSti mice (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) and WT-Sti mice (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). The sleep architecture of <i>ChAT-ChR2</i>-Sti mice was also significantly different from that of either <i>ChAT-ChR2</i>-NonSti or WT-Sti mice. Time spent in NREM sleep in <i>ChAT-ChR2</i>-Sti mice increased by 160% compared with that of <i>ChAT-ChR2</i>-NonSti mice (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), while no difference was seen in the duration of REM sleep (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). No significant differences in sleep architecture were observed between <i>ChAT-ChR2</i>-NonSti and WT-Sti mice. To test how long it took for recovery of normal function, we recorded sleep states for 1\u2009hr following cessation of stimulation, and found that it took an average of 40 \u00b1 3\u2009min to recover (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that activation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN can promote sleep onset and alter sleep architecture to protect sleep."

Confocal imaging of brain slices from B13 mice (which express GFP under a <i>PV</i> promoter) after immunostaining for <i>PV</i> confirmed that <i>PV</i>-positive neurons were abundant throughout the TRN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To identify <i>PV</i>-positive neurons for mechanistic studies, we crossed <i>ChAT-ChR2</i> mice with B13 mice. This generated mice expressing both ChR2 in the cholinergic neurons and GFP in the <i>PV</i> neurons, permitting whole-cell recordings from GABAergic neurons while optically stimulating local cholinergic input. Immunostaining revealed numerous cholinergic fibers surrounding <i>PV</i>-positive neurons in the TRN of <i>ChAT-ChR2</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). First, we stimulated cholinergic neurons and found that a 5-ms pulse could induce the firing of action potentials in the cholinergic neurons when stimulating cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We then tried 5-ms, 50-ms, 100-ms, and 200-ms light pulses to stimulate cholinergic fibers and recorded neuronal activity of GABAergic neurons in the TRN. (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We found that light pulses of short duration, such as 5 ms and 50 ms, failed to induce bursts of action potentials in GABAergic neurons. A light pulse of at least 100 ms was required to induce bursts of action potentials and spindles. Whole-cell recording in voltage-clamp mode from <i>PV</i> neurons in the TRN-containing brain slice showed that pure light stimulation (without injection current) of a 200-ms pulse evoked fast excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, lower). They were accompanied by rhythmic high-frequency bursts of action potentials (APs) seen in current-clamp mode (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, upper). In vivo extracellular recording in the TRN of anesthetized <i>ChAT-ChR2</i> mice revealed that the optical stimulation of cholinergic fibers induced spikes in the GABAergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These results suggest that cholinergic projections to the TRN produce excitatory input sufficient to evoke bursts of APs in <i>PV</i>-containing TRN neurons. To determine which cholinergic projections mediated these results, we injected AAV9-CAG-DIO-EGFP-2A-TVA and AAV9-CAG-DIO-RV-G into the TRN. Three weeks later, EnvA-pseudotyped RV-\u0394G-DsRed, which can infect efficiently and travel retrogradely, was injected into the same site. We found that the DsRed signal was detected in some cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nBM) in the basal forebrain (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) of the brain stem (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Statistical results showed that about 30% of cholinergic neurons (VAChT antibody labeled) were positive for mCherry (retrograde virus labeled) in the nBM, and ~7% were positive for mCherry in the PPTg (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These results demonstrate that TRN neurons receive cholinergic projections from both the basal forebrain and brain stem."

Recordings in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 \u03bcM) to block APs completely prevented optical stimulation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN of <i>ChAT-ChR2</i> mice from eliciting EPSCs in <i>PV</i>-containing neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This is consistent with the EPSCs being AP-dependent, as expected for presynaptic stimulation of transmitter release. In contrast, light-evoked EPSCs were not blocked by including the combination of CNQX (20 \u03bcM) as an inhibitor of glutamatergic AMPA receptors, AP5 (50 \u03bcM) as an inhibitor of glutamatergic NMDA receptors, and picrotoxin (PTX, 100 \u03bcM) as an inhibitor of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This indicates that neither rapid glutamatergic nor GABAergic transmission is required for cholinergic induction of the EPSCs. Dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidine (DH\u03b2E), a selective antagonist of \u03b14\u03b22-containing nAChRs, decreased the amplitude of light-evoked EPSCs by 12%, 34%, and 99% at 5 nM, 10 nM, and 100 nM, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). However, methyllycaconitine (MLA, 5 nM), a specific antagonist of \u03b17-nAChRs, completely blocked the light-evoked EPSCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) and the accompanying bursts of APs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The concentration was consistent with previous research (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bonfante-Cabarcas et al., 1996</a>). Immunostaining yielded extensive labeling for \u03b17-nAChRs on <i>PV</i>-containing neurons in the TRN (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). These results indicate that the light-evoked, AP-dependent release of ACh from cholinergic projections in the TRN elicits EPSCs and bursts of APs in GABAergic neurons of the TRN by activating \u03b17-nAChRs."

For this purpose, we used <i>VGAT-ChR2</i> mice in which ChR2 was specifically expressed in the GABAergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>) so that those neurons would be selectively activated by light pulses delivered to the TRN. Testing the paradigm first in vitro showed that a light pulse of 10 ms applied to an acute slice could induce bursts of APs in GABAergic neurons of the TRN (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Testing three different optical stimulation patterns in vivo (20\u2009Hz, 8\u2009Hz, or single 10 ms pulses) indicated that 8\u2009Hz stimulation was most successful at evoking spindle oscillations both in waking and NREM states (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Accordingly, we used that stimulation protocol (10 ms of 8\u2009Hz for 1\u2009s at 6-s intervals) to induce sleep in <i>VGAT-ChR2</i> mice, which were raised under a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Blue laser light of 473 nm was delivered into the TRN through a 200 \u03bcm optical fiber for 1\u2009hr starting 4\u2009hr after 'light off'. Both EEG and EMG were recorded, and sleep onset and sleep architecture were then measured. Optical stimulation significantly reduced the sleep onset time of <i>VGAT-ChR2</i> mice (<i>VGAT-ChR2</i>-Sti, 27.2 \u00b1 3.2\u2009min) compared with that of the controls (<i>VGAT-ChR2</i>-NonSti; 5.5 \u00b1 0.8\u2009min, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Similarly, the duration of sleep during the 1\u2009hr optical stimulation period also increased by 156% compared with that of the controls (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Furthermore, the architecture of sleep differed greatly in <i>VGAT-ChR2</i>-Sti mice vs. <i>VGAT-ChR2</i>-NonSti mice. Time spent in the NREM phase was significantly greater for <i>VGAT-ChR2</i>-Sti mice (27.2 \u00b1 2.1\u2009min) than for <i>VGAT-ChR2</i>-NonSti mice (15.2 \u00b1 1.3\u2009min, p &lt; 0.01), while no significant differences were seen in the duration of the REM stage (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). These results support that elevating the activity of GABAergic neurons in the TRN can promote sleep in ways that mimic the effects of cholinergic excitation of the TRN."

Furthermore, cholinergic fiber activation of GABAergic neurons in the TRN in vivo can promote sleep onset and increase the probability of spindle oscillation and duration of the NREM phase. Lastly, direct stimulation of GABAergic neurons in the TRN to elicit activity comparable to that induced by cholinergic input produces the same kinds of changes in sleep behavior seen following cholinergic activation of the neurons. These results demonstrate the capacity of cholinergic input, acting through GABAergic neurons in the TRN, to promote critical features of sleep."

These earlier studies suggested that cholinergic input to the TRN neurons was primarily inhibitory, acting on M2 muscarinic ACh receptors (<a href=\"#bib30\">McCormick and Prince, 1986</a>). Local delivery of ACh to the TRN was seen to induce only a slow inhibitory response, leading to the conclusion that the ACh-induced bursts of APs observed were somehow the result of the GABAergic neurons in the TRN becoming hyperpolarized (<a href=\"#bib30\">McCormick and Prince, 1986</a>). Instead, we showed cholinergic input to the TRN stimulates the GABAergic neurons via \u03b17-nAChRs, and that this input through \u03b17-nAChRs induces bursts of action potentials and promotes/stabilizes sleep. Previous failures to detect an \u03b17-nAChR response in the TRN were almost certainly caused by electrical stimulation methods, i.e. ACh perfusion. Because \u03b17-nAChRs desensitize so quickly (<a href=\"#bib18\">Giniatullin et al., 2005</a>), their responses can be missed in experimental paradigms. Another group found that Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs) induced by electrical stimulation were blocked by dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidine (Dh\u03b2E, 300 nM), indicating that the EPSPs were mediated by \u03b14\u03b22-containing nAChRs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). However, Dh\u03b2E (300 nM) can block both \u03b14\u03b22- and \u03b17 nAChR-mediated currents (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alkondon and Albuquerque, 1993</a>), and non-specific electrical stimulation may enable extrasynaptic transmitter release."

Selective activation of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain has been shown to induce an immediate transition from sleep to waking (<a href=\"#bib22\">Han et al., 2014</a>). The present study specifically activated cholinergic fibers locally in the TRN, which, surprisingly, showed the opposite effect. It induced transition from waking to sleep, indicating that direct cholinergic projections to the TRN promote sleep onset and sleep stabilization. GABAergic neurons of the TRN fire AP bursts mediating slow and spindle waves (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cain and Snutch, 2010</a>). These bursts are very important for the generation of thalamocortical spindle waves (<a href=\"#bib41\">von Krosigk et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 2013</a>), and spindle rhythms play important roles in protecting sleep initiation and elevating arousal threshold (<a href=\"#bib39\">Steriade, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wimmer et al., 2012</a>). We propose that excitation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN acts on GABAergic neurons through \u03b17-nAChRs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Roth et al., 2000</a>) to depolarize the membrane sufficiently to induce bursts of APs. Our results demonstrate a significant positive relationship between spindle density and the promotion of the NREM state and sleep stabilization. Activation of the cholinergic neurons appears to play critical roles in the switch from waking to sleep and in the protection of sleep itself, especially by increasing the NREM state."

Cholinergic neurons in the nBM of the basal forebrain project to the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and TRN, and that in the PPTg of the brainstem project to the thalamus, new striatum, and basal forebrain. Activation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN may antidromically collaterally excite cell bodies, or collaterally act on other neurons, leading to the indirect effects on sleep. To address this question, we locally injected the \u03b17 receptor blocker MLA in the TRN and found that sleep induced by cholinergic fiber stimulation was completely inhibited, suggesting that the possibility was small."

Though \u03b17-nAChRs are widely distributed in the brain, they are usually thought to provide a modulatory role. From presynaptic locations, the receptors can enhance transmitter release (<a href=\"#bib31\">McGehee et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gray et al., 1996</a>), while from post- or presynaptic locations they can modulate synaptic responses indirectly through calcium-dependent mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dajas-Bailador and Wonnacott, 2004</a>). Rarely, if ever, have \u03b17-nAChRs been shown to be the primary mediator of rapid, synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS). In the present study, the ability of MLA to block cholinergically-induced EPSCs in the TRN clearly implicates \u03b17-nAChRs. Immunostaining corroborated the presence of \u03b17-nAChRs in the GABAergic neurons of the TRN. The inability of CNQX, AP5, and PTX to block the EPSCs demonstrated that rapid glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission were not responsible for the EPSCs. The fact that \u03b17-nAChRs have a high relative permeability to calcium (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertrand et al., 1993</a>) and trigger calcium release from internal stores (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dajas-Bailador and Wonnacott, 2004</a>) may be relevant for the kinds of signaling effective at promoting spindle oscillations."

Cholinergic neurons play an important role in waking-to-sleep cycles and in sleep stabilization by activating GABAergic neurons in the TRN through \u03b17-nAChRs. Although a great deal of work has been done to examine the roles of cholinergic systems in biological rhythms, previous experiments have mainly focused on the sleep-to-waking transition, and results have been limited by the experimental techniques used. Cholinergic projections from different brain areas to the TRN may have opposing effects, acting through different receptors and synaptic pathways (<a href=\"#bib15\">Everitt and Robbins, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott et al., 2003</a>). The states of sleep and waking may be determined by the opposing inputs serving as a system of checks and balances. Because a number of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ferrarelli and Tononi, 2011</a>), show sleep disturbances and loss of spindle oscillation, the results reported here may also be useful in suggesting new targets for therapeutic intervention in these cases."

Detected spindles with durations lower than 0.5\u2009s or longer than 5\u2009s were discarded. To estimate spindle density (SD) during a given sleep stage, all spindles were counted and the total number was divided by the total recording time."

In this study, Ni et al. report their surprising finding that stimulating cholinergic inputs to the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) facilitates sleep onset and protects non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, likely through increasing spindle oscillations of TRN neurons. In addition, cholinergic inputs directly evoke fast excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and elicit bursts of spike firing by targeting \u03b17-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These discoveries are significant because it challenges the dogma that cholinergic activity is positively associated with arousal. The finding of rapid cholinergic EPSCs is also novel because acetylcholine typically produces modulatory effects via volume transmission in the brain. The manuscript is well written and the figures are well organized."
