While dendritic cells (DCs) are important for T follicular helper (Tfh) cell priming, how this process is regulated in vivo is unclear. We show here that the depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs specifically enhanced the development of Tfh cells, germinal center B cells and antibody responses against protein antigens. Exaggerated antibody responses in mice depleted of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs occurred in the absence of any adjuvants, and resulting antibodies had broader specificity and higher affinity to the immunogen. CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs express high levels of PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Blocking PD-1 or PD-L1 during priming in wild-type mice partially mimicked the phenotype of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depleted animals, suggesting their role in Tfh suppression. Transient depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC results in the generation of autoreactive IgG responses. These results revealed a novel regulatory mechanism and a key role of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs in blocking autoantibody generation."

While dendritic cells (DCs) are important for T follicular helper (Tfh) cell priming, how this process is regulated in vivo is unclear. We show here that the depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs specifically enhanced the development of Tfh cells, germinal center B cells and antibody responses against protein antigens. Exaggerated antibody responses in mice depleted of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs occurred in the absence of any adjuvants, and resulting antibodies had broader specificity and higher affinity to the immunogen. CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs express high levels of PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Blocking PD-1 or PD-L1 during priming in wild-type mice partially mimicked the phenotype of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depleted animals, suggesting their role in Tfh suppression. Transient depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC results in the generation of autoreactive IgG responses. These results revealed a novel regulatory mechanism and a key role of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs in blocking autoantibody generation."

Through presenting processed antigens on their MHC molecules, dendritic cells (DCs) are primarily responsible for initiating T cell-mediated cellular immunity, which is also required for T cell-dependent antibody responses. Germinal centers (GCs) are specialized microarchitecture within the follicles in the secondary lymphoid organs, where B cells undergo affinity maturation, selection and proliferation. Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) are a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells marked by their expression of inhibitory receptor PD-1 and chemokine receptor CXCR5 and play important roles in the development of GC B cells by providing differentiation, survival and proliferation signals (<a href=\"#bib8\">Crotty, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ma et al., 2012</a>). While co-maturation between GC B cells and Tfh is required to stably maintain both subsets (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baumjohann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Deenick et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Qi et al., 2008</a>), it has been shown that early instructive signals from antigen-bearing DCs are both necessary and sufficient to prime Tfh differentiation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baumjohann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Choi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Deenick et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Goenka et al., 2011</a>)."

Moreover, DCs are also important as antigen carriers that provide the initial antigen-specific receptor signaling to the cognate B cells in the lymph nodes (LNs) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Qi et al., 2006</a>). Indeed, in vivo antigen delivery to receptors specifically expressed by DCs can trigger robust class-switched antibody production even without an adjuvant (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chappell et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Xu and Banchereau, 2014</a>). Importantly, antigen delivery strategies targeting distinct DC subsets seem to result in increased antigen-specific antibody titers regardless of the DC subset targeted (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lahoud et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yao et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that multiple DC subsets are capable of inducing antibody production (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chappell et al., 2014</a>).

CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs are a major subset of migratory CD11b<sup>+</sup> DDCs that express the highest levels of PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, among DC subsets in the skin-draining LNs (dLNs) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kumamoto et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Murakami et al., 2013</a>).

By using Mgl2-DTR mice in which one of the endogenous <i>Mgl2</i> alleles (encoding CD301b protein) are replaced with a diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR)-GFP cassette, we have shown previously that inducible depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs by injecting diphtheria toxin (DT) results in impaired Th2 differentiation of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following footpad immunization of protein antigen with Th2 adjuvants as well as after subcutaneous infection with <i>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</i>.

Notably, CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depleted mice developed strong antibody responses against OVA even when they were immunized without any adjuvants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). A possible explanation of these results is that the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs killed by DT release endogenous materials capable of serving as an adjuvant to stimulate antibody responses to OVA. To test this possibility, we next immunized lethally-irradiated WT mice reconstituted with a 1:1 mixture of WT and Mgl2-DTR bone marrow (BM) cells. In order to avoid any DT-induced adjuvanticity masked by the presence of exogenous adjuvant, we took advantage of the adjuvant-free immunization approach. Although antibody levels in BM chimeric mice were generally lower than in non-irradiated mice, prime (day 0) and 2 boosts (days 14 and 21) with adjuvant-free OVA resulted in significantly increased OVA-specific antibody titers in mice reconstituted only with Mgl2-DTR BM cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). In contrast, mice reconstituted with a mixture of WT and Mgl2-DTR yielded minimal antibody production (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>), indicating that the remaining WT CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs were sufficient to suppress humoral immunity in such BM chimeric mice even if the dying CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs released endogenous adjuvants. Collectively, these results indicate that materials released from dying CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC cannot account for the enhanced antibody responses, and that lifting suppression by CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs enables induction of antibody to soluble protein antigens in the absence of adjuvants."

A larger fraction of OT-II CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiated into Tfh cells in CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depleted hosts than in undepleted hosts (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e</a>). We previously reported OT-II cells primed in the absence of CD301b<sup>+</sup>\u00a0DCs failed to differentiate into Th2 cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kumamoto et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, we observed reduced IL-4 production from CXCR5<sup>-</sup> OT-II effector T cells in CD301b<sup>+</sup>\u00a0DC-depleted mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8f</a>). How is it possible to have elevated type 2 antibody production in the absence of IL-4-secreting Th2 cells? Although IL-4 is the signature cytokine for Th2 cells, IL-4 is also abundantly produced by Tfh cells and supports production of type 2 antibodies (<a href=\"#bib24\">King and Mohrs, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Reinhardt et al., 2009</a>). In fact, the expression levels (MFI) of IL-4 and IL-21 in CXCR5<sup>+</sup> OT-II Tfh cells remained intact in CD301b<sup>+</sup>DC-depleted mice, while the percentages of IL-4- or IL-21-secreting OVA-specific Tfh (CXCR5<sup>+</sup> OTII) increased (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8f</a>). These results indicate that CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depletion results in loss of Th2 cells but increase in Tfh cells capable of secreting IL-4 and IL-21. Further, our data suggest that the expansion of antigen-specific Tfh cells capable of secreting IL-4 and IL-21 underlies the enhanced type 2 antigen-specific antibody and GC B cell responses in the absence of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs."

Although CD301b-driven DTR-GFP expression is detectable only in a subset of Langerin<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs, epidermal LCs are also depleted by DT treatment in Mgl2-DTR mice (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kashem et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kumamoto et al., 2013</a>). To test whether the enhanced antibody responses in DT-treated Mgl2-DTR mice were due to the depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs or LCs, we used huLangerin-DTR mice, in which DT treatment specifically depletes epidermal LCs without affecting Langerin<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a,b</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013c</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bobr et al., 2010</a>). Depletion of LCs did not result in enhanced OVA-specific antibody production (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9c</a>). Similarly, depletion of all Langerin<sup>+</sup> DCs (LCs and Langerin<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs) in msLangerin-DTR mice (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kissenpfennig et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Poulin et al., 2007</a>) had no impact on antibody responses (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9d</a>). Nevertheless, DCs in general were required for B cell priming, as class-switched antibodies were completely abolished in CD11c-DTR;Mgl2-DTR mice (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9e</a>), in which LN-resident DCs were further depleted (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013c</a>).

Surprisingly, despite near complete depletion of all migratory DC subsets (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>), co-depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs, LCs and Langerin<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs did not revert the enhanced antibody titers, Tfh, and GC B responses in CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depleted animals (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9c,d,f</a>). Similarly, depleting Ly6C<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocyte-derived DCs concurrently with the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC depletion (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>) did not revert the expanded Tfh and GC cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9g</a>), suggesting that the potential increase in Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells in the periphery (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) does not directly explain the phenotype.

Regulation of Tfh responses at early phases by CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs may be critical in preventing excess antibody responses to foreign and self-antigens, which can lead to host pathology through complement fixation, and deposition of antibody-immune complex (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rouse and Sehrawat, 2010</a>).

Furthermore, depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs led to antibody production to a soluble antigen even in the absence of adjuvants. Specifically, depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs lifted the suppression on Tfh such that their numbers and percentages increased within the LNs, leading to preferential activation of isotype switched antibody-secreting cells.

Similarly, continuous blockade as well as genetic deletion of PD-L1 was shown to enhance Tfh and GC B cell expansion upon type 2 immunization (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hams et al., 2011</a>). In these studies, due to the timing of the PD-L1 blockade (past Tfh priming), activated B cells were the major source for the PD-L1 relevant to the memory Tfh population. In contrast, our results clearly demonstrated that the transient depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs during the priming phase had a significant positive impact on humoral immunity that persisted even after the secondary immunization. Our study shows that the PD-L1 blockade cannot further enhance Tfh and GC B responses when CD301b<sup>+</sup>\u00a0DCs are depleted. Consistently, a recent report demonstrated that neonatal blockade of PD-L1 that is preferentially expressed by CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs in the lung results in exaggerated antibody production later in life during adulthood, suggesting the contribution of a similar DC subset that suppresses humoral immunity through PD-L1 expression (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gollwitzer et al., 2014</a>).

For such therapy to be efficacious, CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs must be able to reverse a preexisting state of B cell stimulation. On the other hand, inhibiting the functions of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs and/or PD-1 ligands at the time of vaccination may improve the efficacy of a suboptimal vaccine to generate robust isotype-switched immunoglobulin responses. Our data showed that PD-L1 blockade could be delivered transiently at the time of vaccination, alleviating concerns of untoward consequences of long term inhibition of PD-1 engagement (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brahmer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Topalian et al., 2012</a>). While PD-L1 blockade with an antibody is not a practical solution to boost prophylactic vaccine approaches due to the inhibitory costs associated with the antibody, future development of an affordable PD-L1 antagonist might enable implementation of this concept into vaccine design. An optimal combination of the adjuvant to activate B cell affinity maturation and a blocker of inhibition imposed by the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC may provide an ideal setting for generating robust protective humoral responses."

To generate CD11c-DTR;Mgl2-DTR mice, CD11c-DTR mice (B6.FVB-Tg(<i>Itgax</i>-DTR/EGFP)57/Lan/J; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:004509\">IMSR_JAX:004509</a>) were crossed with <i>Mgl2<sup>DTReGFP/DTReGFP</sup></i>homozygotes, then transgene-bearing offspring were screened with the following primers to amplify the boundary between the <i>Itgax</i> promoter and the DTReGFP cassette: CAGAGCCTGCTTCTGTTCTCCAG and GTTGCTGGTTCCAGCAGCTAG. For generating chimeric mice, WT B6 mice were irradiated with two doses of 475 cGy (total 950 cGy) and reconstituted with 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> WT, Mgl2-DTR or 1:1 mixture of WT and Mgl2-DTR BM cells. The mice were used for experiments more than eight weeks after the BM transplantation. In most experiments, 2\u20136 month-old female mice were used. However, due to mouse availability, mice of both sexes were used in experiments involving mice with huLangerin-DTR or CD11c-DTR construct. No gross difference was noted between male and female in those experiments. All animal protocols (protocol number 10365) were approved by and performed in accordance with guidelines set by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University."

For affinity maturation analyses, additional plates were coated with 10 \u00b5g/ml NP<sub>16</sub>OVA, NP<sub>4</sub>BSA, or NP<sub>34</sub>BSA (Biosearch Technologies). Plates were then incubated with PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum to block non-specific bindings. Sera were diluted in the blocking buffer as indicated, and applied to the plates. Subclass-specific antibodies that bound to OVA were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Southern Biotech), IgG1, IgG2b or subclass-nonspecific IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or by biotinylated anti-mouse IgE (RME-1, BioLegend) followed by HRP-streptavidin. Total serum immunoglobulin content was determined with ELISA plates coated with 10 \u00b5g/ml goat anti-mouse IgG+M (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated subclass-specific detection antibodies. Serum anti-nuclear IgG antibodies were captured by Mouse ANA Total Ig ELISA Kit (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX) and detected by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Fcg Fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch). HRP binding was visualized by 1xTMB ELISA Substrate Solution (eBioscience) and the absorbance at 450 nm was detected by a plate reader (Model 680, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For calculating EC<sub>50</sub> and the maximal absorbance (A<sub>max</sub>), data from each mouse were fit to Y = A<sub>max</sub>*X/(EC<sub>50</sub>+X) + NS*X + Background, where Y is observed absorbance and X is serum dilution, with the following restraints: 0\u00a0&lt;\u00a0A<sub>max\u00a0</sub>&lt;\u00a03.5, 0\u00a0&lt;\u00a0EC<sub>50\u00a0</sub>&lt;\u00a01, 0\u00a0&lt; NS &lt; 2, and 0\u00a0&lt; Background &lt; 0.1.

In this earlier manuscript the authors described a nearly complete abolishment of IL-4 production by CD4 T cells in LN and spleens after CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC depletion and OVA+papain immunization. Given that IgE and IgG1 antibody class-switching is generally accepted to be IL-4 dependent, the current description of substantial increases in such antibody isotypes is difficult to reconcile with the previously published data. A more substantial effort is thus required to consolidate the two findings and explain how one generates type-2 antibody responses in absence of type-2 cellular immunity. For example, is there a substantial increase in IL-4 production from non-T cell sources (i.e. basophils, mast cells) after DC depletion? Is there an increase in IL-21 production that is capable of substituting for lack of IL-4? Are other non type-2 antibodies, such as IgG2a, IgG3 also increased? The 2013 manuscript demonstrated substantial increases in frequency of IFN\u03b3 producing cells, which would in principle skew the humoral response towards these antibody subclasses. In this regard, it would be helpful to demonstrate intracellular IL-4 and IFN\u03b3 cytokine levels after ex vivo restimulation on the non-Tfh, Tfh and GC-Tfh phenotype CD4 T cells following immunization in this depletion model."

However, a possibility remains that modulation of Ab production in these mice is due to an off target effect of DT injection through the depletion of a DC-independent Mgl2+ population. Can the authors provide a detailed description of the composition of macrophages and DC in the skin DLN and non-DLN and peritoneal cavity of Mgl2+-DTR mice treated with DT or PBS? These data should be added to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>.

Instead, to our excitement, even though the Th2 responses was reduced (consistent with our study in 2013), we found that the Tfh cells generated in the absence of CD301b DCs produce intact levels of IL-4 and IL-21 (comparable to the undepleted mice). In addition, there were a lot more Tfh cells in the CD301b-depleted mice. We believe that the combination of the increase in the number of Tfh, as well as their robust secretion of IL-4 and IL-21, explains why the CD301b-depleted mice are capable of generating the type 2 antibody responses including IgE and IgG1.
