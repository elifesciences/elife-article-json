Here, we show that p38 MAP Kinase (MAPK) modulates this hypoxia response pathway in <i>C. elegans</i>. Mutants lacking p38 MAPK components <i>pmk-1</i> or <i>sek-1</i> resemble mutants lacking the hypoxia response component and prolyl hydroxylase <i>egl-9</i>, with impaired subcellular localization of Mint orthologue LIN-10, internalization of glutamate receptor GLR-1, and depression of GLR-1-mediated behaviors. Loss of p38 MAPK impairs EGL-9 protein localization in neurons and activates the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1, suggesting that p38 MAPK inhibits the hypoxia response pathway through EGL-9. As animals age, p38 MAPK levels decrease, resulting in GLR-1 internalization; this age-dependent downregulation can be prevented through either p38 MAPK overexpression or removal of CDK-5, an antagonizing kinase. Our findings demonstrate that p38 MAPK inhibits the hypoxia response pathway and determines how aging neurons respond to hypoxia through a novel mechanism."

When oxygen levels are sufficiently high (i.e., normoxia), the EGL-9/PHD family of prolyl hydroxylases employs molecular oxygen, 2-oxoglutarate, and iron to hydroxylate specific proline side chains on the HIF\u03b1 transcription factors, resulting in the inactivation of these transcription factors by ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Fong and Takeda, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Aragones et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Wong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Majmundar et al., 2010</a>). When oxygen levels are not sufficiently high (i.e., hypoxia), the EGL-9/PHD prolyl hydroxylases become inactive, resulting in HIF\u03b1 protein stabilization and thus a transcriptional change in gene expression (<a href=\"#bib83\">Semenza, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fandrey and Gassmann, 2009</a>). Depending on the specific cells and tissues undergoing stress, HIF\u03b1 can mediate adaptive responses to hypoxia that include increased erythropoiesis, increased angiogenesis, and reprogramming of metabolism away from oxidative phosphorylation and towards glycolysis and anaerobic fermentation. In addition to its role in response to acute hypoxic stress, the hypoxia response pathway also helps to maintain stem cell niches and tumor growth and metastasis in cancer (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amelio and Melino, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Gupta et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ito and Suda, 2014</a>).

Here, we show that signaling through the kinases SEK-1 (p38 MAPKK) and PMK-1 (p38 MAPK) regulate GLR-1 recycling and GLR-1-mediated reversal behavior by modulating the hypoxia response pathway. Loss of function mutations in either <i>pmk-1 or sek-1</i> mimic the effects of hypoxia on GLR-1 trafficking and behavioral output. Wild-type SEK-1 and PMK-1 promote the endosomal localization of EGL-9 and LIN-10 in neurons under normoxia, and the effect of <i>sek-1</i> or <i>pmk-1</i> mutations on EGL-9/LIN-10 co-localization and GLR-1 recycling requires the activity of the CDK-5 kinase. Wild-type SEK-1 and PMK-1 also regulate HIF-1 throughout the organism. Older animals show reduced levels of activated PMK-1, GLR-1 internalization, and decreased GLR-1-mediated behaviors. The reduction of functional GLR-1 in older animals can be prevented through either the overexpression of PMK-1 or the removal of CDK-5. Our findings demonstrate that p38 MAPK is a modulator of the hypoxia response pathway through EGL-9, and that this novel mechanism helps determine how aging neurons respond to hypoxia."

We introduced a transgene, <i>nuIs25</i>, which expresses full length, functional GLR-1 receptors tagged with GFP (GLR-1::GFP), into <i>pmk-1</i> mutants. In wild-type nematodes, GLR-1::GFP is localized to discrete puncta (mean diameter of 0.48 microns, SEM of 0.01 microns, 95% of puncta are between 0.32 and 0.73 microns in diameter) along the ventral cord dendrites of interneurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), with 85% of such puncta colocalized with synaptic markers (<a href=\"#bib81\">Rongo et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Burbea et al., 2002</a>). We found that <i>pmk-1</i> mutants accumulated GLR-1::GFP in elongated structures (mean length of 2.30 microns, SEM of 0.10 microns, 95% of these accumulations are between 1.32 and 3.49 microns in length) along the ventral cord (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), similar to the GLR-1::GFP accumulations in elongated endosomes observed in mutants for membrane recycling factors (<a href=\"#bib88\">Shi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Glodowski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Kramer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Park et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Rongo et al., 1998</a>). GLR-1 puncta and GLR-1 accumulations are distinct enough in shape and size to allow easy quantification of their respective numbers along the ventral cord dendrites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). We found a sizeable decrease in the number of GLR-1 puncta (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and a five-fold increase in the number of GLR-1 elongated accumulations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) in <i>pmk-1</i> mutants relative to wild type. Expression of a wild-type <i>pmk-1</i> cDNA from the <i>glr-1</i> promoter, which drives expression specifically in the command interneurons, was sufficient to rescue <i>pmk-1</i> mutants, indicating a cell autonomous requirement for PMK-1 function (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). The observed changes in GLR-1 were unlikely to be due to general defects in synapse formation or overall cell polarity, as the localization of a synaptobrevin-GFP reporter (SNB-1::GFP), which decorates synaptic vesicles at interneuron presynaptic elements when expressed from a transgene, did not change in <i>pmk-1</i> mutants relative to wild type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). In addition, we detected similar levels of <i>glr-1</i> mRNA in wild-type animals and <i>pmk-1</i> mutants, indicating that PMK-1 regulates GLR-1 in a posttranscriptional fashion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>)."

To determine if these signaling molecules are required to regulate GLR-1 trafficking, we examined GLR-1::GFP in loss of function mutations for both genes. A loss of function allele for <i>sek-1</i> resulted in a similar GLR-1 localization phenotype to that observed in <i>pmk-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Expression of a wild-type <i>sek-1</i> cDNA from the <i>glr-1</i> promoter rescued <i>sek-1</i> mutants, indicating a cell autonomous requirement for SEK-1 function (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Double mutants for <i>sek-1</i> and <i>pmk-1</i> showed a similar phenotype compared to either single mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>), suggesting that these mutations do not yield an additive phenotype and are thus likely acting in the same pathway. By contrast, two loss of function, putative null alleles in <i>nsy-1</i> (one a nonsense mutation and the other an insertion resulting in a frameshift), did not result in abnormal GLR-1 localization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Thus, whereas SEK-1 appears to be the MAPKK for PMK-1 to regulate GLR-1 localization, NSY-1 is unlikely to be the p38 MAPKKK. We examined mutants for several additional MAPKKK genes in <i>C. elegans</i>, including TIR-1, MLK-1, and KIN-18; however, we did not observe changes in GLR-1::GFP localization (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Mutants for MAPKKK DLK-1 also do not show the same GLR-1::GFP localization defect observed in <i>pmk-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib75\">Park et al., 2009</a>). Our results suggest that the upstream MAPKKK for this function of p38 MAPK signaling is likely to be a noncanonical kinase relative to traditional MAPK signaling."

We examined GLR-1:GFP in <i>pmk-2(qd284)</i> mutants, which contain a deletion and frameshift at the beginning of the ORF, making this mutant allele a likely null; however, we did not observe a difference in GLR-1 puncta or accumulations compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

By contrast, there is approximately a 50% increase in the portion of GLR-1::GFP that is co-localized with mRFP::SYX-7 in <i>sek-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J-M,R</a>) and <i>pmk-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2N-Q,R</a>) mutants, indicating that GLR-1 accumulates at SYX-7-decorated endosomes in these mutants, at least in soma. Taken together, our results indicate that in the absence of SEK-1/PMK-1 signaling, GLR-1 receptors accumulate in elongated, internal, and post-endocytic compartments in the command interneurons, resulting in diminished GLR-1 function and behavioral output."

Given the role of PMK-1 in stress response, we reasoned that PMK-1 signaling might regulate GLR-1 recycling through EGL-9 and the hypoxia response pathway. To explore this possibility, we examined GLR-1::GFP in wild-type and <i>pmk-1</i> mutant animals exposed to hypoxia using a published nitrogen displacement approach (<a href=\"#bib78\">Pocock and Hobert, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Park et al., 2012</a>). As previously described (<a href=\"#bib76\">Park et al., 2012</a>), wild-type animals exposed to 0.5% oxygen (hypoxia) localized GLR-1::GFP to elongated structures along dendrites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B,E,F</a>), similar to those observed in <i>pmk-1</i> and <i>sek-1</i> mutants under normoxic conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E,F</a>).

Mutations in <i>egl-9</i> under normoxia cause a similar effect on GLR-1 trafficking to that in wild-type animals under hypoxia (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). We therefore examined GLR-1::GFP in double mutants between <i>egl-9</i> and either <i>sek-1</i> or <i>pmk-1</i>. We found no statistically significant difference between the double mutants and either single mutant, under conditions of both normoxia and hypoxia (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>).

LIN-10::GFP is localized to small puncta along dendrites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), and this localization requires EGL-9 and oxygen but is inhibited by CDK-5 (<a href=\"#bib76\">Park et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Juo et al., 2007</a>).

As the p38 MAPK pathway could regulate LIN-10 either directly or indirectly by regulating EGL-9, we examined EGL-9E::GFP subcellular localization in p38 MAPK signaling mutants. Whereas EGL-9E::GFP is localized to puncta along the ventral cord dendrites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,E</a>), it was diffusely distributed in <i>sek-1</i> and <i>pmk-1</i> mutants, with few puncta and little total punctate EGL-9E::GFP along dendrites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,E,F</a>). One explanation for the impaired localization of EGL-9E in p38 MAPK signaling mutants is if EGL-9E were to depend on LIN-10, the localization of which is also affected in these p38 MAPK mutants. The loss of EGL-9E would thus be a secondary consequence of impaired LIN-10 localization in these mutants. We examined EGL-9E::GFP in <i>cdk-5</i> mutants (which have augmented LIN-10 subcellular localization) and double mutants between <i>cdk-5</i> and either <i>sek-1</i> or <i>pmk-1</i>. EGL-9E is localized similar to wild type in <i>cdk-5</i> single mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,E,F</a>), and mutations in <i>cdk-5</i> do not suppress the effects on EGL-9E subcellular localization observed in <i>sek-1</i> or <i>pmk-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E,F</a>). Similarly, whereas LIN-10 subcellular localization depends on EGL-9E, the subcellular localization of EGL-9E does not require LIN-10 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). Taken together, our data indicate that p38 MAPK signaling acts genetically upstream of EGL-9, promoting the subcellular localization of the EGL-9E isoform in neurons independent from its effects on LIN-10 or CDK-5."

To confirm this change in p38 MAPK signaling, we generated lysates (in three separate biological replicates) from wild-type animals and <i>pmk-1</i> mutants either from young larvae (stage L4) or older adults (day 9 post-L4 stage), separated the proteins by SDS-PAGE, and probed them with an anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibody and an anti-actin antibody as a loading control (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>).

We tested these possibilities by first generating a transgene that overexpresses a wild-type PMK-1 cDNA via the <i>glr-1</i> promoter. Wild-type animals that overexpress PMK-1 from this transgene showed normal punctate GLR-1::GFP even in 9-day adults (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E\u2013H</a>), indicating that simply elevating PMK-1 is sufficient to suppress the defects observed during aging (when the levels of activated PMK-1 are observed to drop). Next, we examined older <i>cdk-5</i> mutants and found that they also failed to accumulate endosomal GLR-1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D,G,H</a>), indicating that CDK-5 is required for the defect in GLR-1 recycling in older animals. Mutations in <i>cdk-5</i> also partially restored GLR-1 function in aging animals, as <i>cdk-5</i> adults as late as 6 days post L4 have elevated rates of spontaneous reversals relative to wild-type animals of the same age (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9I</a>). Moreover, mutations in <i>cdk-5</i> restore reversals to <i>pmk-1</i> mutants in young and old animals to levels that were higher than those for wild-type animals (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9I</a>). Whereas <i>cdk-5</i> mutants showed more robust reversal behavior during aging relative to wild type, they nevertheless still showed a decline in reversals and GLR-1 puncta number over time, suggesting that additional factors contribute to age-associated decline in this behavioral modality. For example, muscle decline dramatically impairs locomotion in 9-day adults, making interpretation of more subtle behavioral phenotypes like reversal frequency challenging (<a href=\"#bib42\">Herndon et al., 2002</a>). Taken together, our results indicate that AMPAR GLR-1 recycling and function decline with age, and that this decline is due, at least in part, to depressed p38 MAPK signaling, subsequent activation of the HIF-1-independent hypoxia response pathway, and CDK-5 activity."

The non-canonical pathway senses oxygen via a specific isoform of EGL-9, called EGL-9E, which, when activated by oxygen, binds to the scaffolding molecule LIN-10, recruiting it to endosomes where it promotes the recycling of GLR-1 AMPARs to the synapse (<a href=\"#bib76\">Park et al., 2012</a>). We find that if animals are under normal oxygen conditions and are young, then the p38 MAPKK SEK-1 and the p38 MAPK PMK-1 promote EGL-9 activity (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013D</a>). Active EGL-9 in turn triggers HIF-1 turnover, thereby preventing a HIF-1 transcriptional response. In addition, p38 MAPK signaling also promotes the association of EGL-9E with LIN-10, in turn mediating steady GLR-1 recycling. By contrast, if animals are under conditions of hypoxia, then EGL-9 activity is depressed, resulting in HIF-1 stabilization and the activation of the HIF-1 transcriptional response. In addition, depressed EGL-9 activity exposes LIN-10 to phosphorylation by the CDK-5 kinase, resulting in LIN-10 delocalization in neurons and depressed GLR-1 recycling (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E\u2013H</a>). This regulation results in long term changes in synaptic efficacy in the command circuit, which switches locomotion behavior from local foraging to long-distance roaming. This behavioral switch in locomotion allows the animal to escape the hypoxic environment. As animals grow older, p38 MAPK activity decreases despite the presence of ample oxygen, resulting in impaired GLR-1 recycling through the action of CDK-5. Our findings suggest that p38 MAPK signaling is an important part of the hypoxia response pathway."

Oxygen also activates SEK-1 and PMK-1 (p38 MAPK, green and yellow ovals, respectively) through a mechanism that remains unknown. Activated p38 MAPK in turn phosphorylates one or more proteins (possible EGL-9 itself, as speculated in this cartoon with a \u2018P\u2019 in a yellow circle) that activate EGL-9 and trigger its recruitment to endosomes. Meanwhile, GLR-1 receptors (red channels) undergo continual endocytosis at the synapse. (<b>B</b>) Isoform EGL-9E, now bound to oxygen and possibly phosphorylated by p38 MAPK, becomes localized to endosomes, where it binds the PDZ-PTB domain protein LIN-10 (orange oval) and recruits it to endosomes by preventing its phosphorylation by the CDK-5 kinase (purple oval). (<b>C</b>) Once at endosomes, LIN-10 promotes the recycling of endocytosed GLR-1 AMPARs (red channels in the endosome) back to the synapse. (<b>D</b>) The final outcome is that GLR-1 synaptic levels are maintained. (<b>E</b>) Under hypoxia, lack of oxygen results in lower SEK-1/PMK-1 p38 MAPK activity and inactive EGL-9.

The activation of p38 MAPK contributes to ischemic injury, necrosis, and apoptosis, resulting in heart failure in the case of myocardial infarction and neurodegeneration in the case of ischemic stroke (<a href=\"#bib66\">Marber et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Kumphune et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Barone et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lai et al., 2014</a>). The specific mechanism by which activated p38 MAPK contributes to ischemia-induced damage is unclear, but is thought to stem in part from its regulation of growth factor and apoptosis signal transduction pathways. Several groups have observed changes in HIF activity triggered by ERK and p38 MAPK (possibly activated by ROS generated from mitochondria under hypoxia), yet it remains controversial whether the mechanism is direct phosphorylation of HIF-1 by p38 MAPK (<a href=\"#bib23\">Conrad et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bardos and Ashcroft, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Minet et al., 2001</a>).

While PHD proteins are well-established oxygen sensors in the hypoxia response pathway, there is also a likely role for the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) in sensing oxygen during hypoxia. Even under conditions of normal oxygen, the ETC produces low levels of ROS (<a href=\"#bib94\">Turrens, 2003</a>). Perhaps ROS activates a baseline level of p38 MAPK under normoxic conditions, acting as part of an additional oxygen sensing mechanism (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Indeed, we did observe that normal oxygen levels promoted PMK-1 nuclear localization in the command interneurons, and hypoxia resulted in PMK-1 depletion from the nucleus, suggesting that oxygen (or its byproducts) could be activating PMK-1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H,I</a>)."

In this scenario, <i>pmk-1</i> mutants accumulate products of oxidative stress (e.g., ROS and oxidized macromolecules), which would mimic hypoxia, perhaps through the actions of ROS directly inactivating EGL-9. We feel that this scenario is unlikely because <i>skn-1</i> mutants, which are arguably more impaired for the oxidative stress response than are <i>pmk-1</i> mutants, do not show induction of hypoxia response target genes like <i>nhr-57</i> (<a href=\"#bib72\">Oliveira et al., 2009</a>). Nor did <i>skn-1</i> mutants show the same GLR-1 localization defects that we observed in <i>pmk-1</i> and <i>egl-9</i> mutants. Instead, we favor a model in which PMK-1 directly silences the hypoxia response during normoxia, and that it does so independent of its role in the oxidative stress response. It remains a possibility that the additional ROS that is generated during long-term hypoxia and/or reoxygenation might further activate PMK-1, providing a negative feedback that restores the hypoxia response back to a normoxia baseline, thereby minimizing the dangers of ROS production that occur during extended hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation. Too much PMK-1 activation (e.g., during extreme anoxia) might contribute to toxicity; indeed, mutations in <i>pmk-1</i> increase the survival of animals exposed to long-term anoxia (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hayakawa et al., 2011</a>)"

Our results clearly show that NSY-1 is not required for oxygen levels to modulate the hypoxia response, and given that NSY-1 is the sole <i>C. elegans</i> ASK1 ortholog, it seems likely that SEK-1 and PMK-1 are activated by a different MAPKKK under these conditions.

Moreover, loss of HIF-1 can also promote longevity under conditions of elevated temperature via a separate mechanism (<a href=\"#bib59\">Leiser et al., 2011</a>). As nematodes grow older, the levels of active PMK-1 decrease (<a href=\"#bib100\">Youngman et al., 2011</a>), which might result in elevated HIF-1 activity.

We find that GLR-1 accumulates in endosomes as nematodes grow older, similar to what occurs in young <i>pmk-1</i> mutants, and that either the simple overexpression of PMK-1 or the removal of CDK-5, an inhibitor of its downstream target LIN-10, restores both GLR-1 localization and function to levels observed in younger animals.

Young adult or L4 stage larvae (10\u201315 animals each) were resuspended in 250 \u00b5l of Trizol and lysed by one round of freezing (by liquid nitrogen) and thawing (60\u00b0C) with subsequent vigorous vortexing in 4\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. PCR was performed in an Eco real-time qPCR system (Illumina, San Diego,CA) using iScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR Kit With SYBR Green (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA) in 20 \u00b5L reactions with 20\u00a0ng of RNA template. For <i>glr-1</i>, we used as forward (5\u2019-TGATACAATGAAAGTTGGAGCAAATC-3\u2019) and reverse (5\u2019-CATCGCATTGTCCTCTATCATACCAC-3\u2019) primers.

Samples were measured two to three times and average values were used for the calculation of relative fold changes. The relative levels of <i>glr-1, pmk-1, and nhr-57</i> mRNA were normalized to the levels of <i>act-1</i> mRNA in each preparation. For each experiment, the value for wild type was set to 1 and other values were normalized accordingly."

The results are timely and of general interest, because increasing evidence from various animal models suggests that the MAPK/P38 kinase pathway is associated with the hypoxic response, oxidative stress, inflammation, and aging, but the underlying mechanisms are often not fully understood. Here, the authors delineate a novel pathway involving components of p38 MAP kinase signaling that participates in the control of glutamate receptor (GLR1) trafficking and GLR-1 mediated reversal behavior. Interestingly, the identified pathway is mediated via an HIF-independent mechanism involving EGL-9, a prolyl hydroxylase isoform. A strength of the study is that authors use multiple assays to measure the interactions between p38 MAPK and hypoxia-sensing including measurements of glutamate receptor distribution within axons, surface-accessibility of glutamate receptors and a behavioral assay that reflects the function of glutamatergic synapses in motor circuits."

Also, there is a recent paper in Science Signaling elaborates a gas messenger-dependent acute oxygen sensing involving carbon monoxide-PKG-mediated phosphorylation of target enzyme as a critical step (Yuan et al., Sci.

This is an interesting point and would benefit from additional data. The authors could test other genes linked to PMK-1 signaling, such as TIR-1 and ATF-7. Also, there are a small number of MAPKKKs encoded by the <i>C. elegans</i> genome. If the canonical MAPKKK is not regulating PMK-1 in this context perhaps one of the others is. There are a small number of predicted MAPKKKs in <i>C. elegans</i>. Do any MAPKKK mutants have defects in glutamate receptor localization?"

The cell body is large enough to provide structural distance between the plasma membrane and endosomes, allowing us to visualize endosomal structures. This approach has been adopted in multiple previous publications (Zhang et al., 2012, Chun et al., 2008, Monteiro et al., 2012, Kowalski et al., 2011).
