Here we report the results of those experiments. We regenerated cells stably expressing ectopic wild-type and mutant phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2 (PREX2) using the same immortalized human NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes as the original study. Evaluation of PREX2 expression in these newly generated stable cells revealed varying levels of expression among the PREX2 isoforms, which was also observed in the stable cells made in the original study (Figure S6A; Berger et al., 2012). Additionally, ectopically expressed PREX2 was found to be at least 5 times above endogenous PREX2 expression. The monitoring of tumor formation of these stable cells <i>in vivo</i> resulted in no statistically significant difference in tumor-free survival driven by <i>PREX2</i> variants, whereas the original study reported that these <i>PREX2</i> mutations increased the rate of tumor incidence compared to controls (Figure 3B and S6B; Berger et al., 2012). Surprisingly, the median tumor-free survival was 1 week in this replication attempt, while 70% of the control mice were reported to be tumor-free after 9 weeks in the original study. The rapid tumor onset observed in this replication attempt, compared to the original study, makes the detection of accelerated tumor growth in <i>PREX2</i> expressing NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes extremely difficult. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result."

Here we report the results of those experiments. We regenerated cells stably expressing ectopic wild-type and mutant phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2 (PREX2) using the same immortalized human NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes as the original study. Evaluation of PREX2 expression in these newly generated stable cells revealed varying levels of expression among the PREX2 isoforms, which was also observed in the stable cells made in the original study (Figure S6A; Berger et al., 2012). Additionally, ectopically expressed PREX2 was found to be at least 5 times above endogenous PREX2 expression. The monitoring of tumor formation of these stable cells <i>in vivo</i> resulted in no statistically significant difference in tumor-free survival driven by <i>PREX2</i> variants, whereas the original study reported that these <i>PREX2</i> mutations increased the rate of tumor incidence compared to controls (Figure 3B and S6B; Berger et al., 2012). Surprisingly, the median tumor-free survival was 1 week in this replication attempt, while 70% of the control mice were reported to be tumor-free after 9 weeks in the original study. The rapid tumor onset observed in this replication attempt, compared to the original study, makes the detection of accelerated tumor growth in <i>PREX2</i> expressing NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes extremely difficult. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result."

To investigate the functional relevance of <i>PREX2</i> mutations, six of the identified mutant PREX2 isoforms were ectopically expressed in immortalized human melanocytes and tumor formation was monitored after injecting into immunodeficient mice. Four of the mutations, three truncating variants as well as a point mutant, resulted in a statistically significant decrease in tumor-free survival compared to control melanocytes, expressing wild-type PREX2 (PREX2<sup>WT</sup>) or green fluorescent protein (GFP)."

However, this is limited to what was obtainable from the original paper and through communication with the original authors, which means there might be particular features of the original experimental protocol that could be critical, but unidentified. So while some aspects, such as cell line, site of injection, number of cells injected, and strain and sex of mice were maintained, others were unknown or not easily controlled for. These include variables such as <i>PREX2</i> copy number in transformed cells, circadian biological responses to therapy (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu and Kettner, 2013</a>), the microbiome of recipient mice (<a href=\"#bib17\">Macpherson and McCoy, 2015</a>), housing temperature in mouse facilities (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kokolus et al., 2013</a>), and cell line drift (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hughes et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Kleensang et al., 2016</a>).

All mice were housed in a disposable ventilated cage, with a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle, at 19\u00b0C to 22\u00b0C, and 40% to 65% relative humidity. All animals were fed Harlan #2018 rodent diet and sterile acidified water <i>ad libitum</i>. Mice were monitored every day for clinical observation and every other day for signs of tumor growth. Mice were weighed once a week during the duration of the study. Animals removed from the\u00a0study were anesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed by cervical dislocation."
