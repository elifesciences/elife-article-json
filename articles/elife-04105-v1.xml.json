This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u2018Senescence surveillance of pre-malignant hepatocytes limits liver cancer development\u2019 by <a href=\"#bib9\">Kang et al. (2011)</a>, published in Nature in 2011. The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 3B, 3C, 3E, and 4A. In these experiments, <a href=\"#bib9\">Kang et al. (2011)</a> demonstrate the phenomenon of oncogene-induced cellular senescence and immune-mediated clearance of senescent cells after intrahepatic injection of <i>NRAS</i> (Figures 2I, 3B, 3C, and 3E). Additionally, <a href=\"#bib9\">Kang et al. (2011)</a> show the specific necessity of CD4+ T cells for immunoclearance of senescent cells (Figure 4A). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a>, and the results of the replications will be published by <i>eLife</i>."

This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u2018Senescence surveillance of pre-malignant hepatocytes limits liver cancer development\u2019 by <a href=\"#bib9\">Kang et al. (2011)</a>, published in Nature in 2011. The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 3B, 3C, 3E, and 4A. In these experiments, <a href=\"#bib9\">Kang et al. (2011)</a> demonstrate the phenomenon of oncogene-induced cellular senescence and immune-mediated clearance of senescent cells after intrahepatic injection of <i>NRAS</i> (Figures 2I, 3B, 3C, and 3E). Additionally, <a href=\"#bib9\">Kang et al. (2011)</a> show the specific necessity of CD4+ T cells for immunoclearance of senescent cells (Figure 4A). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a>, and the results of the replications will be published by <i>eLife</i>."

Senescence is often associated with a pre-malignant state, and a wide range of cancers have been shown to harbor populations of senescent cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Quintanilla et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Braig et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Collado et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bennecke et al., 2010</a>). An ongoing debate in the field of cancer biology has been the phenomenon of \u2018immune surveillance\u2019, or the ability of the immune system to specifically identify and eliminate nascent pre-cancerous (e.g., senescent) cells before they can cause harm (<a href=\"#bib14\">Swann and Smyth, 2007</a>). The possibility of tailored, pro-senescent therapies for cancer treatment has provoked considerable interest."

The authors attempted to mimic aberrant oncogene activation by stably delivering oncogenic <i>Nras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> into mouse livers in vivo. Hydrodynamic injection of transposable elements resulted in mosaic generation of <i>Nras</i>-expressing hepatocytes that displayed senescent markers. Time course analyses revealed a progressive loss of <i>Nras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> expressing senescent cells within 2 months after stable intrahepatic delivery of oncogenic <i>Nras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup>. Studies were carried out in wild-type mice, as well as immunocompromised mice (SCID/beige and CD4<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>). Importantly, all analyses were paralleled using an <i>Nras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> effector loop mutant (<i>Nras</i><sup><i>G12V/D38A</i></sup>) incapable of signaling to downstream pathways (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kang et al., 2011</a>)."

Further, Kang et al. demonstrated the necessity of a functional adaptive immune response in clearing senescent cells, as mice harboring mutations in adaptive immunity (SCID/beige) showed significant attenuation in the ability to clear pre-malignant cells.

A two-way ANOVA can consist of up to three tests, the treatment, the time, and the treatment\u2013time interaction. The power calculations use a single effect size, which we do not understand. As the experiment is trying to replicate an already detected effect, then each such effect can be clearly stated.

Prior experience involving tumor in vivo studies shows that such experiments have considerable mouse-to-mouse variation. It would be a shame if conclusions are limited by too small sample numbers, and in light of the statistical issue just raised, it seems important to increase the animal numbers per group to n = 10\u201315 because of the low projecting 81% confidence level at n = 5. Also, the power calculations seem to justify 3 in each sample, yet 5 in each group are planned. The authors need to better explain their power calculations that led them to conclude openly 3 animals per group would be sufficient and why they then choose 5 animals per group. Is this to cover some results lost due to failure? In any case, the power calculations for these comparisons need to state what specific effect sizes will be viewed as a replication of the original study."

So the explicit effect sizes for each factor and for each of the 6 experiments need to be stated. While it is a good idea to combine the two results (original and replication) in a forest plot, this will give an inflated estimate of any effect sizes due to the publication selection operating on the first article. The decision regarding whether there has been replication should be based on the results of the replication study alone. So it may be that smaller effect sizes than those reported in the original article would still be viewed as strong evidence of the anticipated effect. In such a case, as stated above (point #3), a larger sample size would be justified and should be strongly considered at this stage."

However, we also plan to perform a t-test outside the framework of an ANOVA similar to the original paper (although performing a planned comparison within the framework of an ANOVA is more powerful than performing a separate t-test if the assumption of ANOVA is valid) to allow for a direct comparison to what was originally reported."

The authors need to better explain their power calculations that led them to conclude openly 3 animals per group would be sufficient and why they then choose 5 animals per group.

To account for variation in injections, we have increased the sample size to seven mice per treatment group for the experiments performed in Protocol 1, as well as the 12-day experimental arm of Protocol 2. We believe this increased sample size will allow us to analyze a minimum of five mice per group in downstream analyses.

Based on these factors, we have reconsidered the inclusion of the 7-month in vivo tumor formation experiment in this replication study. Given that the original effect size is unknown, we feel that a replication of this experiment would be considered exploratory in nature; thus, we have reallocated our resources toward increasing sample sizes for, and therefore improving, those arms of the study that can be statistically compared to the original data."

This will allow direct comparison of the original and replication effect sizes and the combination of the two will give an estimation of the current knowledge for that given effect size.

The cross-study variation, such as approaches that utilize the 95% confidence interval of the effect size, can be useful in conducting power calculations when planning adequate sample sizes for detecting the true population effect size, which requires a range of possible observed effect sizes. However, the Reproducibility Project: <i>Cancer</i> Biology is designed to conduct replications that have 80% power to detect the point estimate of the originally reported effect size. While this has the limitation of being underpowered to detect smaller effects than what is originally reported, this standardizes the approach across all studies to be designed to detect the originally reported effect size with at least 80% power. Also, while the minimum power guarantee is beneficial for observing a range of possible effect sizes, the experiments in this replication, and all experiments in the project, are designed to detect the originally reported effect size with a minimum power of 80%. Thus, performing power calculations during or after data collection is not necessary in this replication attempt as all studies included are already designed to meet a minimum power or are identified beforehand as being underpowered and thus are not included in the confirmatory analysis plan. The papers by Giovanni Parmigiani and collaborators highlight the importance of accounting for variability that can occur across different studies, specifically gene expression data. While it is possible for a difference in variance between the originally reported results and the replication data, this will be reflected in the presentation of the data and a possible reason for obtaining a different effect size estimate."
