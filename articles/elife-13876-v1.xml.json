This receptor dimer formed through contacts between parts that are inside the cell as well as the regions embedded in the membrane. These VEGFR-2 dimers were active, but only to a low level. However, the activity of the receptor was increased in the presence of VEGF. Sarabipour et al. found that binding of VEGF promoted VEGFR-2 to change its three-dimensional shape, which made it more active. Further work suggested that VEGFR-2 dimers must first correctly assemble in the absence of VEGF so that active VEGFR-2 dimers can form at a later stage. Hence a VEGFR-2 dimer on its own is an important intermediate that is needed for full activation of the receptor."

Sarabipour et al. found that this mutation causes VEGFR-2 to change its shape even when no VEGF is present and thus makes the receptor overly active. Finally, tumors need to form new blood vessels to grow and survive. These new findings suggest that drugs that interact with VEGFR-2 dimers in the absence of VEGF may be able to prevent the receptor from becoming activated and could thus help cut the blood supply to tumors and treat cancers."

Instead, two models, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, are discussed. The first is the 'diffusion-based' or 'canonical' model, in which RTKs exist as monomers in the absence of ligand because they do not have a sequence-specific propensity for lateral interactions. Ligand binding induces RTK dimerization, which brings the two catalytic domains into close proximity so they can cross-phosphorylate each other (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fantl et al., 1993</a>). The second model is the 'pre-formed dimer model', in which the receptors can form dimers in the absence of ligand because they have a sequence-encoded propensity to interact laterally even in the absence of ligand, and thus they exist in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in the absence of ligand. Ligand binding promotes structural changes in the EC domain that trigger transmembrane signaling by reorienting the catalytic kinase domains (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belov et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bocharov et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016</a>)."

The histograms are well described by Gaussian distributions. The center of the Gaussians, ~0.45, corresponding to a separation between the fluorescent proteins by ~56\u2009\u00c5, was the same for all six ligands. Since the fluorescent proteins were attached to the TM domains via flexible linkers, we conclude that the TM domain configuration is similar in the presence of the six ligands.

The fraction of dimeric C482R EC+TM receptor was similar in the presence and absence of ligand and was not dependent on receptor concentration. The Intrinsic FRET values measured in the presence and absence of ligand were the same, and similar to those measured for ligand-bound wild-type VEGFR-2 dimers. Thus, it appears that this mutation locked the VEGFR-2 dimer in the ligand-bound conformation in the absence of ligand.

First, there are sequence-specific contacts between the TM domains in the dimers. In particular, at least one of the amino acids E764, T771, or F778 participates in helix-helix contacts, as the substitution of these three amino acids with Ile changed the structure and the stability of the EC+TM VEGFR-2 dimers in the absence of ligand. Second, these dimers are further stabilized by contacts between the IC domains, since the removal of the IC domains decreased dimer stability by 2.7 kcal.mole<sup>-1</sup>. Therefore, specific interactions between the IC domains regulate receptor dimerization and ensure control of receptor activity in the absence of ligand. Thus, our observations that VEGFR-2 phosphorylation can take place in the absence of ligand, along with the FRET results, point to a significant role of the IC domains in dimer stabilization. Third, we discovered a new role for domains D4 and D7 in unliganded VEGFR-2 dimerization, by showing that they stabilize VEGFR-2 dimers in the absence of ligand. Indeed, the substitution of Ig-domains D4 or D7 significantly altered both dimerization and Intrinsic FRET in the absence of ligand. Fourth, we showed that the wild-type VEGFR-2 EC domain, as a whole, inhibits receptor dimerization, as inferred from the fact that deletion of the entire EC domain increased the stability of the dimers by 1.4 kcal.mole<sup>-1</sup>. Overall, this work documents a complex role for the EC domain in VEGFR-2 dimer stabilization and establishes the existence of specific dimer stabilizing contacts in the EC, the TM, and the IC domains of VEGFR-2."

Yet, there have been no direct experimental data demonstrating a structural change in the VEGFR-2 TM domain dimer configuration in the plasma membrane, in response to ligand binding, so far. Here, we directly observed such a structural change using our quantitative FRET methodology which allowed us to monitor the response of the receptor dimer to ligand binding from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. FRET is extremely sensitive to the distance between the fluorescent proteins, which we measure with 1\u2009\u00c5 precision."

A similar mechanism of activation, involving an increase in TM helix C-termini separation, has been proposed for EGFR (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bocharov et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arkhipov et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Endres et al., 2013</a>).

Decrease in the separation of the TM domains upon ligand binding has also been observed for the constitutively dimeric IGF-1R (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kavran et al., 2014</a>).

The FRET efficiency did not depend on receptor concentration, suggesting that all receptors were in the ligand-bound dimeric state. We measured the same Intrinsic FRET for EC+TM VEGFR-2 in the presence of all six ligands. Furthermore, these ligands gave rise to the same VEGFR-2 activities as determined by Western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies. We thus propose that the six ligands induced the same structural changes in the receptor, resulting in a similar VEGFR-2 phosphorylation increase. The VEGFR-2 case is thus quite different from the case of the FGFR dimers, which exhibit different structural and biological responses to the ligands fgf1 and fgf2 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016</a>)."

Thus, for VEGFR-2 it is reasonable to assume that binding affinity may determine the specific signal output by VEGFR-2 in response to different ligands. Alternatively, different intracellular trafficking of the ligand-bound receptors may dictate signaling specificity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clegg et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ballmer-Hofer et al., 2011</a>)."

For instance, the D4 substitution stabilized the EC+TM VEGFR-2 dimer, altered its structure, and abolished ligand binding. The D7 substitution, on the other hand, caused receptor oligomerization that rendered the receptor non-responsive to ligand. The E764I-T771I-F778I TM domain mutations stabilized the VEGFR-2 dimer in the absence of ligand and changed its structure as reflected by Intrinsic FRET, but did not increase receptor phosphorylation. The N762I-V769I-G770I mutations altered the structure of the ligand-bound VEGFR-2 dimer and reduced receptor phosphorylation. Quite remarkably, none of the engineered mutations increased VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, suggesting that VEGFR-2 is surprisingly resistant to aberrant activation."

Western blots performed under reducing and non-reducing conditions revealed that there are no disulfide-linked C482R dimers. Instead, quantitative FRET experiments revealed that the constitutive C482R dimers adopt the ligand-bound wild-type dimer conformation, both in the presence and absence of ligand. Thus, the C482R mutation increased VEGFR-2 activation by mimicking the structural effect of the ligand. Similar behavior has been observed for the pathogenic A391E, R248C, and S249C FGFR3 mutants, linked to skeletal and cranial growth disorders (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sarabipour and Hristova, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Del Piccolo et al., 2015</a>).

Decrease in the separation of the TM domains upon ligand binding has also been observed for the constitutively dimeric IGF-1R (Kavran et al., 2014).
