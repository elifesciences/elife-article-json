Here we discover and characterize the sets of mouse lncRNAs induced by inflammatory signaling via TNF\u03b1. TNF\u03b1 regulates hundreds of lncRNAs, including 54 pseudogene lncRNAs, several of which show exquisitely selective expression in response to specific cytokines and microbial components in a NF-\u03baB-dependent manner. Lethe, a pseudogene lncRNA, is selectively induced by proinflammatory cytokines via NF-\u03baB or glucocorticoid receptor agonist, and functions in negative feedback signaling to NF-\u03baB. Lethe interacts with NF-\u03baB subunit RelA to inhibit RelA DNA binding and target gene activation. Lethe level decreases with organismal age, a physiological state associated with increased NF-\u03baB activity. These findings suggest that expression of pseudogenes lncRNAs are actively regulated and constitute functional regulators of inflammatory signaling."

Here we discover and characterize the sets of mouse lncRNAs induced by inflammatory signaling via TNF\u03b1. TNF\u03b1 regulates hundreds of lncRNAs, including 54 pseudogene lncRNAs, several of which show exquisitely selective expression in response to specific cytokines and microbial components in a NF-\u03baB-dependent manner. Lethe, a pseudogene lncRNA, is selectively induced by proinflammatory cytokines via NF-\u03baB or glucocorticoid receptor agonist, and functions in negative feedback signaling to NF-\u03baB. Lethe interacts with NF-\u03baB subunit RelA to inhibit RelA DNA binding and target gene activation. Lethe level decreases with organismal age, a physiological state associated with increased NF-\u03baB activity. These findings suggest that expression of pseudogenes lncRNAs are actively regulated and constitute functional regulators of inflammatory signaling."

Dysregulation of NF-\u03baB plays an important role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory disease, when proinflammatory cytokines drive NF-\u03baB activation, which in turn drives production of proinflammatory cytokines. The NF-\u03baB family is composed five proteins in mammals: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50 (NF-\u03baB1), and p52 (NF-\u03baB2). NF-\u03baB family members form dimers, either as heterodimers or homodimers, which can act to positively or negatively regulate target gene expression. Under normal conditions NF-\u03baB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to I\u03baB proteins. Activation by binding of ligand to a receptor on the cell surface leads to a signaling cascade which leads to phosphorylation, rapid ubiquitination, and degradation of the I\u03baB proteins. This reveals a nuclear localization sequence on NF-\u03baB. NF-\u03baB is then translocated to the nucleus where it binds DNA to activate or repress transcription. Importantly, only Rel family members (RelA, RelB, and c-Rel) can activate transcription. p50 and p52 can form heterodimers with RelA family members to activate transcription, or alternatively form homodimers to compete for NF-\u03baB binding sites reviewed in <a href=\"#bib19\">Hayden and Ghosh (2012)</a>."

TNF\u03b1 regulates the transcription of 3596 protein coding genes, 48 annotated lncRNAs, 54 pseudogene lncRNAs, and 64 de novo lncRNAs. We validate a subset of these lncRNAs, and classify them by response to various microbial components and proinflammatory cytokines, dependence on RelA and subcellular localization. We identify an lncRNA pseudogene, Lethe (named after the mythological river of forgetfulness, for its role in negative feedback), which is expressed in response to proinflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and the anti-inflammatory agent, dexamthasone, but is not responsive to microbial components, and is primarily found on the chromatin. Lethe is regulated by RelA, independent of pseudogene family members and proximal genes. Additionally, Lethe is dramatically downregulated in aged spleen. Finally, Lethe binds directly to RelA to inhibit NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity. These findings suggest that Lethe may function as a novel negative regulator of NF-\u03baB, to help fine tune the inflammatory response."

On average, more than 20 million reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm9 assembly) for each treatment condition (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). First, reads were mapped to the mouse mm9 reference genome using TopHat (<a href=\"#bib43\">Trapnell et al., 2009</a>). Using an in-house generated script, RefSeq and Ensemble annotated transcripts\u2019 expression in the form of RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon model per million) were obtained and those transcripts with at least a twofold change in expression and an average RPKM &gt; 1, were defined as significant. Reference based de novo transcriptome assembly of mapped reads was performed using two methods. Raw reads were mapped using TopHat and de novo transcriptome assembly of mapped reads was performed using, Cufflinks (<a href=\"#bib44\">Trapnell et al., 2010</a>) and Scripture (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guttman et al., 2010</a>) in parallel. RefSeq and Ensemble annotated transcripts were downloaded from UCSC table browser, and these annotated transcripts were filtered out from Scripture and Cufflinks-assembled transcriptomes to yield about 1500 novel de novo isoforms that are expressed at an RPKM &gt; 1. Because many isoforms mapped to a single locus, we further filtered the list of novel transcripts by applying promoter regions as defined by H3K4me3 via chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), which yielded 184 novel loci. To further refine the candidate transcripts, we extracted the raw reads that mapped to those 184 loci, processed a de novo transcript assembly through Trinity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grabherr et al., 2011</a>) and determined the Coding Potential Calculator (CPC) score of each transcript (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kong et al., 2007</a>) to identify 64 novel de novo lncRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>)."

Therefore, we validated our lncRNA candidates in response to TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and agonists of Toll like receptors (TLR) 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>). TLRs are pattern-recognition receptors for pathogen components from bacteria, fungi, or viruses, and play key roles in controlling the innate and adaptive immunity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kawai and Akira, 2010</a>). Indeed, we found that many of the lncRNAs are upregulated in response to distinct stimuli. Most notable, Cox2 Divergent is upregulated in response to proinflammatory cytokines and TLR1-4 agonists. In contrast, Gp96 Convergent is only expressed in response to TNF\u03b1. H2-T32/24AS is responsive to only TNF\u03b1 and TLR3 agonists, whereas HoxA11AS is expressed in response to TLR3 agonists and actually down regulated by TNF\u03b1 stimulation. Lethe is upregulated in response to the proinflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, but not TLR agonists, indicating it may have a function in inflammation, but not in native immunity. Pbrm1 Convergent is highly upregulated in response to IL-1\u03b2, and to a lesser extent TNF\u03b1, and TLR4 and 7 agonists. These results demonstrate that lncRNAs are dynamically and specifically regulated in response to different stimuli, suggesting that the pattern of lncRNAs can serve as an internal representation of a cell\u2019s exposure to distinct inflammatory and pathogenic signals."

First, we performed qRT-PCR in <i>RelA</i>\u2212/\u2212 littermate cells alongside WT cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Cox2 Divergent is dramatically upregulated in response to proinflammatory cytokines and TLR1-4 agonists in WT and to an even larger extent, in <i>RelA</i>\u2212/\u2212 cells indicating that it is not directly regulated by NF-\u03baB component RelA. Additionally, HoxA11AS, H2-T23/24AS, Gp96 Convergent and Scripture 16,612 all show some induction in <i>RelA</i>\u2212/\u2212 cells. In contrast, induction of Lethe, Pbrm1 Convergent and Scripture 60,588 is largely abrogated in <i>RelA</i>\u2212/\u2212 cells, indicating that RelA is required to induce these lncRNAs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Second, we performed RelA chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in WT MEFs. Upon TNF\u03b1 signaling, RelA was found to bind to the promoters of Nfkbia, Gp96 Convergent and Lethe, but was not detected on the promoters of Cox2 Divergent or Pbrm1 Convergent, or Dll1, a negative control (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These results indicate that Lethe and Gp96 Convergent are directly transcriptional targets of RelA, with Lethe being particularly dependent on RelA for induction."

We found that the subcellular distribution of TNF\u03b1\u2212induced lncRNAs vary in a transcript-specific manner. Gapdh was tested as a control and found to be evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm with little transcript found on the chromatin. Likewise, Cox2 Divergent, Gp96 Convergent, and H2-T23/24AS were evenly distributed between nucleus and cytoplasm. HoxA11AS was mostly nuclear with some transcript found in the cytoplasm, but not on the chromatin. Interestingly, Lethe, Pbrm1 Convergent, Scripture 16,612 and Scripture 60,588 were found mostly on the chromatin, with a smaller fraction in the nucleus. These results indicate that Lethe, Pbrm1, Scripture 16,612 and Scripture 60,588 may be directly involved in gene regulation by interacting with the chromatin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). To further determine if it is the nascent transcript or processed transcript that is found on the chromatin, we performed polyA selection on our subcellular fractions and analyzed the results by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, polyadenylated Lethe RNA is still preferentially associated with chromatin compared to two control mRNAs, Actin and Nfkbia (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that full length Lethe is associated with chromatin. Finally, we performed H3-RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) to directly test if lncRNAs are found on the chromatin after cells were stimulated with TNF\u03b1 for 6 hr. We found that Lethe and Pbrm1 Convergent are both found on the chromatin, while Cox2 Divergent and Gp96 Convergent were not detected, confirming our fractionation results (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

In depth analyses have revealed that pseudogenes are important drivers and suppressors of human cancers (<a href=\"#bib33\">Poliseno et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tay et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kalyana-Sundaram et al., 2012</a>). In this study we performed paired-end directional sequencing to identify novel transcripts that are regulated by TNF\u03b1 signaling. We identified 48 annotated lncRNAs, 64 de novo lncRNAs and 54 pseudogene lncRNAs that are differentially regulated with TNF\u03b1stimulation. While prior studies have reported lncRNA induction by endotoxin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guttman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">De Santa et al., 2010</a>), the specificity of the response and requirement of NF-\u03baB were not known. Here, we have characterized a number of transcripts that are induced by a panel of microbial components and inflammatory cytokines. Notably, many lncRNAs are uniquely regulated by specific stimuli in a RelA-dependent fashion. Hence, the repertoire of specific transcriptional programs downstream of inflammatory and innate immunity signaling is expanded by the recognition of lncRNAs reported here."

Lethe is uniquely induced by the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and Lethe inhibits NF-\u03baB by physical interaction to inhibit RelA binding to DNA. Lethe is thus a negative feedback inhibitor of NF-\u03baB signaling, and its mode of action is that of a decoy lncRNA (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wang and Chang, 2011</a>). Lethe\u2019s mechanism of action is reminiscent of similar to Gas5 or PANDA lncRNAs that titrate glucocorticoid receptor or NF-YA transcription factors away from their cognate binding sites, respectively (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kino et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hung et al., 2011</a>). Endogenous polyadenylated Lethe RNA is highly associated with the chromatin fractions. Nonetheless, the current data do not distinguish whether the functional pool of Lethe is on chromatin, in nucleoplasm, or both. When Lethe is fused to a SV40 polyadenylation signal (which will efficiently cause primary transcript processing and polyadenylation), Lethe expression inhibited NF-\u03baB -dependent gene expression in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), suggesting that chromatin tethering as a primary transcript is not strictly required."

Intriguingly, Lethe is also selectively induced by dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid agonist, but not by other nuclear hormone receptor agonists tested. These results raise the tantalizing concept that an anti-inflammatory therapeutic acts in part by directly activating the negative feedback system of pro-inflammatory signaling (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Lethe\u2019s age dependent down regulation is especially interesting because inflammatory diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis have a higher incidence in females indicating that Lethe may have a protector role in the inflammation response that is lost with age. LncRNAs may be particularly suited to play such a balancing role in cellular signaling because its regulatory elements can receive and potentially integrate multiple input signals. The fact that lncRNA expression tends to be more tissue- and state-specific than mRNAs suggests lncRNAs are well positioned to adjudicate and diversify signaling networks in a context-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ravasi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cabili et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Djebali et al., 2012</a>)."

From these data it appears as if there is a global resetting of the expression state form time point 0 to 6 hr.

However, the use of RT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) as an evaluation of the RIP results is potentially problematic since only relatively short stretches of the mRNAs are assayed in this readout. Thus, there are two potential issues using this approach. First, unless the full length of the Lethe 697 nt transcript was targeted by RT-PCR, then it might well be that it was a sub-portion of this region or another transcript that includes the detected Lethe RNA that was detected. Second, depending upon the turnover rate of a primary transcript it would not be unusual to see evidence of the primary Lethe transcript present in the chromatin enriched fraction. The absence of Cox2 Divergent and GP96 Convergent in the chromatin localization is again interesting, but this does not address the question of whether a newly synthesized primary Lethe transcript is being detected and the functioning portion of the Lethe RNA is the smaller signal detected in the nucleus. If the authors have additional evidence that it is the processed version of Lethe that is associated with chromatin, then it would be useful to indicate this."

This is due to the fact that NF-\u03baB induces the transcription of its own inhibitor IkB, which titrates NF-\u03baB out of the nucleus until further signaling induces IkB degradation, allowing NF-\u03baB to bind target genes again (Hoffmann, Levchenko et al. 2002). Between 1.5 and 6 hrs, one can often catch the difference between a peak and a trough, although the actual periodicity is shorter. We have previously observed this oscillatory gene expression pattern by microarrays [Figure 6 in (Kawahara, Michishita et al. 2009); Figure 4 of (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kawahara, Rapicavoli et al. 2011</a>)]. Thus RNA-seq showed an expected pattern of NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression and notably the dynamic range by RNA-seq is greater than previously observed with microarrays. We have previously shown oscillatory patterns of RelA and Sirt6 occupancy at NF-\u03baB target genes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kawahara, Rapicavoli et al. 2011</a>). We apologize that this point was not clear and we have revised the text to explain the change at the 6 hr time point."

However, the use of RT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) as an evaluation of the RIP results is potentially problematic since only relatively short stretches of the mRNAs are assayed in this readout. Thus, there are two potential issues using this approach. First, unless the full length of the Lethe 697 nt transcript was targeted by RT-PCR, then it might well be that it was a sub-portion of this region or another transcript that includes the detected Lethe RNA that was detected</i>."

To our knowledge, RNA immunoprecipitation is routinely read out by qRT-PCR (e.g., (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hung, Wang et al. 2011</a>); (Kretz, Siprashvili et al. 2013)). Many investigators shear or digest the RNA to a small fragment in order to map the site of interaction between protein and RNA. The detection of Lethe poses additional challenges because Lethe is a pseudogene transcript. Only small portions of Lethe sequence uniquely distinguish Lethe from the Rps15a and pseudogene family members (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We tested many primer sets to distinguish Lethe from family members, and also distinguish RNA from contaminating DNA. The primers we chose were the ones that performed the best. The alternative to RT-PCR, such as Northern blot analysis or tiling array analysis hybridization, would have far worse cross hybridization problems than targeted, gene-specific qRT-PCR."

As the reviewers observed, Lethe showed 5 to 10 fold higher chromatin association in cellular fractionation and histone H3 RIP than five other lncRNAs tested at the same time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D, 2E</a>). Two lncRNAs, Cox2 Divergent and GP96 Convergent, showed undetectable signal on H3 RIP; these transcripts were localized to the cytoplasm instead. The chromatin association signal for Lethe is also significantly greater than that of GAPDH (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>), a far more abundant transcript with presumably more copies of primary transcripts. To further address this point, we repeated the chromatin fractionation experiment and analyzed for polyadenylated transcripts in each fraction. The additional requirement of polyadenylation should presumably bias against nascent transcripts, and select for processed, full-length transcripts. Polyadenylated Lethe RNA is still preferentially associated with chromatin compared to two control mRNAs (revised <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that full length Lethe is associated with chromatin."

When Lethe is fused to a SV40 polyadenylation signal (which will efficiently cause primary transcript processing and polyadenylation), Lethe expression inhibited NF-\u03baB -dependent gene expression in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), suggesting that chromatin tethering as a primary transcript is not strictly required. We have added these considerations to the Discussion."
