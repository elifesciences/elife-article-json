The local enhancement theory proposes that presence of social subjects in an environment facilitates other subjects' understanding of the environment. To explore the neural basis of this theory, we examined hippocampal place cells, which represent spatial information, in rats as they stayed in a small box while a demonstrator rat running on a separate, nearby linear track, and as they ran on the same track themselves. We found that place cell firing sequences during self-running on the track also appeared in the box. This cross-environment activation occurred even prior to any self-running experience on the track and was absent without a demonstrator. Our data thus suggest that social observation can facilitate the observer\u2019s spatial representation of an environment without actual self-exploration. This finding may contribute to neural mechanisms of local enhancement."

Behavioral studies have identified many potential mechanisms of how learning can occur through social observation or interaction. Besides the imitation learning that humans and some primates employ (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bandura, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Meltzoff et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Zentall, 2006</a>), a common behavioral effect in many animal species is the so-called 'social facilitation' (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zentall, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Zentall and Levine, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zajonc, 1965</a>) or 'local enhancement' (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heyes and Galef, 1996</a>): an animal\u2019s understanding of an environment is facilitated by the presence of other social subjects in the same environment. Local enhancement can be caused possibly\u00a0by enhanced sensory processing due to heightened attention, acquiring environmental attributes such as safety or food availability, or other unspecified means (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heyes and Galef, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Zentall, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zajonc, 1965</a>). According to this idea, the presence of social subjects in an environment impacts other animals\u2019 neural processing of information related to the environment. In this study, we aim to explore the neural basis of such local enhancement effect of social observation."

For example, when a rat travels along a linear track from one end to the other, a subset of place cells display place fields on the track and they fire one after another in a unique sequence (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lee and Wilson, 2002</a>). When the animal explores a different environment such as an open box, hippocampal place cells 'remap' (<a href=\"#bib23\">Leutgeb et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Colgin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alme et al., 2014</a>), i.e., they either alter firing locations, stop firing, or become active. Given that spatial environments are represented by distinguished place cell activity patterns, we asked how the presence of a rat in an environment such as a track impacts an observer rat\u2019s place cell activity patterns representing the environment. Specifically, we set out to test a hypothesis that an observer\u2019s place cell sequence representing a track can be activated by another rat running on the track, even if the observer is physically in a different environment separated from the track. Through such activation of place cell activity patterns across different environments, here referred to as 'cross-activation', local enhancement may be achieved via strengthening spatial memory representation of an environment without actual self-exploration."

Prior to the recording, a group of 5 of these rats had gone through a training schedule that lasted 2\u20133 days, 15\u201330 min each day, where they were placed in the box while a well-trained demonstrator running back and forth for food reward on a nearby linear track (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). On the first recording day, CA1 cells from these 5 rats were recorded during 3 sessions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In two of these sessions, each of the rats stayed in the box performing the same task as in the training (Pre-box and Post-box sessions). We referred to this configuration of the recorded rat staying in the box while a well-trained demonstrator on the track as the Trained-demo box condition for a Pre- or Post-box session. In between these two sessions, the recorded rat ran the track itself for the first time (Track session). This recording procedure of 3 sessions with Pre- and Post-box under the Trained-demo condition was repeated for 1 or 2 more days. The same recording procedure continued for a total of 6\u201312 days, but with Pre- and Post-box under various other box conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), including removing the demonstrator from the track (Empty-track), removing both the track and demonstrator (No-track), replacing the well-trained demonstrator with a na\u00efve demonstrator that had never been exposed to the track (Na\u00efve-demo) or with a remotely controlled toy car running back and forth on the track (Toy-car), or blocking the recorded rat\u2019s view in the box while a well-trained demonstrator running on the track (Blocked-view). The other group of 4 recorded rats were each trained for 2\u20133 days prior to the recording, similarly as in the first group, but without the presence of a demonstrator on the track. These rats were then recorded for 6-12 days with the same Pre-box, Track and Post-box schedule each day. However, in these rats, the first 2 recording days were under the Empty-track condition, followed by the Trained-demo and other conditions. A total of 3290 putative pyramidal CA1 cells (defined as mean firing rate &lt; 6\u2009Hz) were recorded from all animals on all recording days. Here we analyzed 2200 cells that were active (with mean rate &gt; 0.5\u2009Hz) in at least one of the Pre-box, Track, and Post-box sessions on a given recording day."

The small box and the track, both elevated from the floor, were separated by 25 cm to prevent direct physical contacts between the recorded rat and the demonstrator. The rat in the box exhibited two major types of behavior. The first was a relatively inactive behavior: facing the opening side of the box with little or small irregular movement. On average, the animals spent about 53% of the time facing the opening side of the box. However, this percentage did not differ among different box conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), except for the Blocked-view condition, where the opening side was blocked and rats predictably spent less percentage of time facing the opening side. This result is likely due to the fact that the opening side was the only way of exploring the outside environment regardless of the situation on the track. The second was an active, rotation behavior: the animal\u2019s body rotating clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW), mostly starting from the opening side of the box and ending at the same side (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We identified the active rotation events during all Pre- and Post-box sessions in all rats based on animals\u2019 head directions. On average, 18.7 \u00b1 1.1 rotation events were identified per session and there was no significant difference among different box conditions or between Pre- and Post-box (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The rotation events lasted for an average of 6.67 \u00b1 0.05\u2009s. Analysis of CA1 local field potentials (LFPs) shows that rotation events were accompanied by strong theta (6\u201310\u2009Hz) oscillations (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 2002</a>) without much high-frequency (100\u2013250\u2009Hz) sharp-wave ripples (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buzs\u00e1ki et al., 1992</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since theta is commonly associated with active behavior such as maze-running whereas ripples mostly occur during inactive behavior such as immobility or slow-wave sleep (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Buzs\u00e1ki et al., 1992</a>), the analysis indicates that the hippocampus was in an active state during rotation events. In this study, we focus on the CA1 activity within these active rotation events, because our primary goal is to test our hippocampal cross-activation hypothesis by comparing CA1 activity patterns in the box and those on the track in the same type of active, theta-associated behavior. In addition, since there were multiple rotation events per session, focusing on rotation events permitted the analysis of neural activity over multiple samples of the same behavior."

As illustrated by firing rate maps of CA1 cells (firing rate versus the animal\u2019s head position) in the small box (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), we found that, despite the small size of the box, firing activities of many CA1 cells were not distributed across all the positions where an animal\u2019s head was located, but highly restricted. Due to the circular nature of the rotation behavior, this location specificity led to the appearance of head-direction tuning, as illustrated by a circular firing rate curve (mean firing rate versus the animal\u2019s head direction during rotation events) for each such cell in a box session (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We found that 40% of rotation-active CA1 cells (566 out of 1421) were significantly tuned to head direction during rotation events in the box (p&lt;0.05, Rayleigh test). Consequently, simultaneously recorded CA1 cells in a box session displayed consistent firing sequences during these rotation events. When the animal rotated from different directions (CW versus CCW), the sequences appeared to be reversed to a large extent, but not always (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The mean correlation among all different combinations of events in a session was compared to a distribution of correlation values obtained by random, independent shuffling of the cell\u2019s rate curve in every event (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and z-score transformed. We refer to this z-scored mean cross-event correlation as the rotation-consistency of a cell and defined cells with z-score &gt; 1.645 (p&lt;0.05, <i>Z</i>-test) as rotation-consistent. We found that 74% of rotation-active cells were rotation-consistent. On average, we identified 10.2 \u00b1 0.5 location-consistent cells per box session. We then compared rotation-consistency of the rotation-active cells in different types of rotation events under various conditions. First, we found that the average rotation-consistency within CW or CCW events was significantly greater than that across CW and CCW rotation events of same sessions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), suggesting that the activities of these cells on average showed a dependence on rotation direction. Nevertheless, 42% of rotation-consistent cells (29% of all rotation-active cells) were also consistent between CW and CCW events. This quantification provides an explanation for many, but not always, similar firing sequences in reverse order between CW and CCW rotation events (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, the rotation-consistency was similar among different box conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). These results demonstrate that CA1 cells did not fire throughout a rotation event, but at specific locations of its rotation trajectory, and therefore formed consistent firing sequences during these events."

We then aimed to understand how their activities in the box were related to their activities during self-running on the track. To this end, we first identified individual lap events when the animal ran on the track back and forth from one end to the other (two running trajectories). We then analyzed whether rotation-active cells were also active during lap-running events on a track trajectory. On average, there were 18.8 \u00b1 0.9 laps per trajectory per track session and each lap lasted for 5.8 \u00b1 0.2\u2009s. Among the 2200 cells active either during rotation in the box or during lap-running on the track across all days, 601 cells were active only during rotation, 779 cells only during lap-running, and 820 cells (common cells) during both rotation and lap running on at least one track trajectory (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These numbers indicate that, overall, 58% of all rotation-active cells and 51% of all running-active cells were common cells. However, we found that, in the Trained-demo and Na\u00efve-demo sessions combined, these proportions of common cells (69% of all rotation-active cells, 58% of all running-active cells) were significantly higher than those in other (Empty-track, No-track, Toy-car, Blocked-view) box sessions combined (48% of all rotation-active cells, p=3.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u201321</sup>, <i>binomial</i> test comparing with that of Trained- and Na\u00efve-demo combined; 44% of all running-active cells, p=7.5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20136</sup>).

To quantify this, for each recording day we constructed a template firing sequence consisting of at least 5 common cells, by ordering their peak firing locations on each trajectory of the track (at most 2 templates per day). We then obtained the sequence of these cells within each rotation event (rotation sequence) in Pre- and Post-box that contained at least 5 active common cells, by ordering their peak firing angles. We quantified the similarity between a rotation sequence and a template by a circular matching score, given the circular nature of rotation events. In our method, a high similarity score means a sequence similar to a template with the same or reverse order. We also randomly shuffled a rotation sequence 1000 times and computed the score between each shuffled sequence and the template. If a rotation sequence yielded a score with any of the templates on the same day greater than the 95 percentile of the shuffle-generated scores, we referred to it as a matching sequence."

In contrast, only 73 out of 712 (10%), 13 out of 116 (11%), 42 out of 419 (10%), and 22 out of 314 (7%) of rotation sequences under Empty-track, No-track, Toy-car, and Blocked-view were matching sequences, respectively. To assess how these numbers of matching sequences differed from the chance level, we generated 200 sets of randomized templates under a box condition, each by randomly shuffling cell identities in every template, and identified the number of matching sequences for each set of randomized templates, using the exactly same procedure as described. We used the proportion of randomized template sets that generated a greater number of matching sequences than our actual templates under a box condition as a measure of significance (p value). Relative to the shuffle-generated distribution of number of matching sequences, we found that the actual number of matching sequences was significant under Trained-demo and Na\u00efve-demo, but not under Empty-track, No-track, Toy-car, or Blocked-view (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Furthermore, we also quantified the significance of matching sequences within each individual animal. In this case, we combined the rotation events under Trained-demo and Na\u00efve-demo, in order to obtain sufficient samples for the analysis. We found a significant number of matching sequences consistently in 8 out of the 8 rats that yielded sufficient cells for the analysis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, our analysis indicates that firing sequences of common cells were preserved between lap-running and rotation events under Trained-demo and Na\u00efve-demo conditions. Further analysis found that the precise firing times of common cells were not preserved (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), probably due to non-constant running speed on the track and non-constant turning speed in the box. The results nevertheless indicate that firing sequences of multiple common cells during lap-running were cross-activated in a significant number of rotation events in the box, but only when a demonstrator was present."

Therefore, we analyzed CA1 cells from 5 rats in Pre-box on the first recording day under the Trained-demo condition, before they ran the track themselves for the very first time. As a key control, we also analyzed CA1 cells from other 4 rats in Pre-box on the first recording day under the Empty-track condition, prior to their first self-running on the track.

The fact that the cross-activation only occurred under Trained-demo or Na\u00efve-demo, but not under other conditions, suggests that this was not the case. To further demonstrate that the cross-activation was specific to the box, we conducted additional recordings of CA1 cells from 4 rats during rest sessions before (Pre-rest) and after (Post-rest) they ran the track themselves. During these rest sessions, the animals stayed on top of a small flower pot (20 cm diameter), placed at the center of an enclosed box with 4 high walls. We detected rotation events when animals moved around on top of the flower pot with high theta activity and then identified common cells that were active both in these rotation events and in lap-running events on the track. We found that actual proportion of common cells was similar to the chance proportion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and the actual number of matching sequences was not significantly greater than the chance level (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

We first analyzed the experience dependence at the time scale of sessions, by comparing the CA1 activities between Pre-box and Post-box of Day1 and Day2 combined. We found no significant difference in the proportion of common cells between Pre-box and Post-box (using PDI as a measure, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The actual number of matching sequences was significantly greater than the chance level in both Pre-box and Post-box (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The data thus suggest that the cross-activation in Pre- and Post-box was largely similar. We then analyzed the experience dependence at a longer time scale by comparing these same measures between Day1 and Day2 (with Pre-box and Post-box combined on each day). We found that the cross-activation was also largely similar between Day1 and Day2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>).

We analyzed behavioral and place field parameters in the Track session on the first two days (Day1, Day2). These parameters were compared between the 5 rats that were recorded under the Trained-demo box condition (referred to as Trained-demo rats hereafter) and the 4 under the Empty-track box condition (Empty-track rats). In addition, 5 other rats were not recorded, but went through the same Pre-box, Track and Post-box procedure under either the Trained-demo (4 rats) or the Empty-track (1 rat) condition. The behaviors of these unrecorded rats on the track were included in the behavioral analysis. We need to point out again that all these Trained-demo and Empty-track rats had gone through a training procedure in the small box for 2\u20133 days prior to Day1, with and without the presence of a trained demonstrator, respectively. The behavior on the track was quantified by mean running speed and number of running laps per trajectory. Both parameters in the Trained-demo rats were significantly greater than those in the Empty-track rats on both Day1 and Day2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), suggesting an improvement in track running performance in the former group. For place field analysis, since rats were not exposed to the track before Day1, we focused on how the development of novel place fields on the track differed between the Trained-demo and Empty-track rats. Because place fields developed quickly during first a few laps (<a href=\"#bib14\">Frank et al., 2004</a>) and place cells in the Trained-demo and Empty-track rats should be compared using the same number of laps, we quantified place cell properties within the first 4 laps of each trajectory on each day, by spatial information (an overall measurement of spatial specificity; <a href=\"#bib33\">Skaggs et al., 1993</a>) and lap-consistency (a measure of a cell\u2019s firing reliability from lap to lap, similar to rotation consistency) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng and Ji, 2013</a>). We found that place cell firing on the track in the Trained-demo rats appeared to be more dispersed than those in the Empty-track rats on both Day1 and Day2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Indeed, spatial information of cells in the Trained-demo rats were significantly greater than those in the Empty-track rats on both Day1 and Day2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). This improvement in spatial information was small on Day1 (15% increase in median spatial information from Empty-track to Trained-demo) and became modest on Day2 (38%). Lap consistency of cells in the Trained-demo rats also appeared greater than those in the Empty-track rats, but did not reach statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). The result suggests a mild speedup in novel place field development in the Trained-demo rats. Taken together, our data suggest that cross-activation was accompanied by an improvement in track-running performance and place field development."

Here we examined whether the place cell templates on the track were also replayed within ripple events in the box during Pre-box and Post-box under various box conditions. We first identified individual ripple events in each box session. We found that the number of ripple events per unit time was slightly, but significantly increased from Pre-box (0.28 \u00b1 0.03 ripples/s) to Post-box (0.31 \u00b1 0.02 ripples/s) sessions (<i>t</i> = 2.7, p=0.009, paired <i>t</i>-test; <i>N</i> = 72 sessions with all conditions combined). However, the number of ripples was not significantly different across different conditions in either Pre-box (<i>F<sub>(5,66)</sub></i>= 2.0, p=0.09, <i>One-way ANOVA</i>) or Post-box (<i>F<sub>(5,66)</sub></i> = 1.9, p=0.09)."

Similarly to the identification of matching sequences within rotation events, we used a sequence matching method to determine whether the firing sequence within a candidate ripple event (defined with at least 5 active cells) matched a template sequence, but using a rank-correlation score instead of a circular matching score (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Also similarly, we counted the number of replay events under a box condition and assessed its significance by comparing it to the distribution obtained by random shuffling of templates. First, with Pre-box and Post-box sessions combined, we found a significant number of replay events under all conditions (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). The percentage of replay events among all candidate events was 7.7% under Trained-demo, 12.5% under Na\u00efve-demo, 7.8% under Empty-track, 14.6% under No-track, 9.3% under Toy-car, and 11.2% under Blocked-view. The result suggests that ripple-associated replay occurred in the box, consistent with the previously found 'remote replay' (<a href=\"#bib20\">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</a>), but the replay was comparable with or without a demonstrator. Second, we compared the replay between Pre-box and Post-box with all box conditions combined (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). We found that the number of replay events was significant in Post-box (9.2%), but did not reach the statistical significance in Pre-box (6.7%), suggesting that direct track experience enhanced ripple-associated replay. Finally, we specifically analyzed the replay between the rats under Trained-demo and Empty-track on the first day\u2019s Pre-box and Post-box sessions. Under both conditions, although there appeared an increase in replay from Pre-box (Trained-demo: 4.7%; Empty-track: 4.7%) to Post-box Trained-demo: 7.7%; Empty-track: 6.8%), none of the number of replay events reached the statistical significant level (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>), suggesting the absence of replay before the first track running experience and weak replay after. Our data are thus consistent with the idea that, in contrast to the matching sequences within rotation events, ripple-associated replay was experience-dependent and was not specific to the presence of a demonstrator."

Raster plots of CA1 cells\u2019 spikes versus the demonstrator\u2019s track positions did not show sign of spatial tuning (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). We then used spatial information and lap consistency as quantitative measurements of spatial tuning for each cell active in a box session to the demonstrator\u2019s positions.

We found that CA1 cells formed consistent firing sequences during rotation events in the box. A group of these cells (common cells) were also active during lap-running events on the track with similar firing patterns, as shown by similar multi-cell firing sequences across rotation and lap-running events. This cross-activation was specific to the box and took place only when a demonstrator (either Trained-demo or Naive-demo) was present on the track. Importantly, the cross-activation appeared before the animals\u2019 very first running experience on the track, as well as after the experience, and was accompanied by improved behavioral performance and faster place field development on the track. Our data thus show that place cell activities representing a track can be activated by staying in a separate, nearby box while another rat running on the track. This finding supports our hypothesis that presence of social subjects in an environment can enhance the activation of an observer\u2019s hippocampal place cell activity patterns that encode the environment."

The box size is only slightly bigger than the body length of a typical adult rat, which restricts typical walking behavior but permits body rotation. This box size is also smaller than the width of typical place fields (20\u201350 cm) in regular environments (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</a>). If CA1 cells in the box just fire like regular place cells with normal place fields, they would fire mostly throughout rotation events without a clear pattern. However, we found that different CA1 cells fire at different specific locations of even such a small box and multiple cells fire with consistent sequences during rotation events. Then, what gives rise to these firing sequences? We used head direction tuning (circular rate curve) to quantify rotation-consistent cells during rotation events, due to the circular nature of the rotation. But these cells are unlikely true head direction cells, because they constitute a large percentage of recorded cells in our experiment, but true head direction cells, if any, are very rare in CA1 (5%) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Leutgeb et al., 2000</a>). Given that rotation-consistent CA1 cells fire at consistent head positions of the rotation events and many of them fire at the same positions even when animals rotate from two opposite directions, it is possible that these cells are still place cells that are tuned to head positions, but with place fields 'squeezed' into a small box. This implies that, even if an animal is confined to a small space, place cells are tuned to specific locations within the space in active behavior and they fire with a sequence when the animal actively moves his head along a trajectory. This interpretation is consistent with the well-known phenomenon that place fields shrink as the animal\u2019s space shrinks (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gothard et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">O'Keefe and Burgess, 1996</a>). Alternatively, the firing sequences during rotation could be internally generated to represent internal information or time, similarly as those occur when rats\u00a0are running a wheel or a treadmill before resuming maze-running (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pastalkova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">MacDonald et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2013</a>). Although we cannot rule out this possibility, the consistent head-position tuning suggests that these sequences in the box are at least strongly modulated by spatial cues."

This cross-activation is demonstrated by a significant number of common cells between rotation and lap-running events and their matched multi-cell firing sequences between the two types of events. Under control conditions (Empty-track, No-track, Toy-car, or Blocked-view) or between the track and an enclosed rest box, the number of commons cells is similar to the chance level, suggesting independent, random remapping under these conditions, consistent with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alme et al., 2014</a>). Using the sequence matching method that utilizes high-order firing patterns of multiple common cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lee and Wilson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ji and Wilson, 2007</a>), we found a significant number of sequences during rotation events in the box that match the template sequences on the track. However, we need to point out that this cross-activation is partial, that is, only for a set of common cells, not all place cells active on the track or in the box. In fact, common cells comprise about 58% of place cells on the track under Trained-demo or Naive-demo condition and about 20% of the sequences of these cells during rotation events matched with the track templates. Since we simultaneously recorded only a small sample of CA1 cells, the actual percentage of matching sequences in CA1 is unknown, but likely higher. In any case, our data means that the overall spatial presentations of the track and the box remain relatively separated. However, a significant number of firing patterns are common in both presentations. This finding suggests the existence of common firing motifs consisting of a subset of place cells that can be activated in different environments or in different behavior (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ravassard et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, our results reveal that the presence of social subjects can enhance the cross-activation of such common firing motifs of place cells across different environments."

The fact that cross-activation shows little experience-dependence suggests that it may be driven by sensory cues rather than experience. In our experimental setup, the small box had high walls on its 3 sides with the other side opening toward the track. This configuration provides common sensory input, especially distal visual cues in the room, when the animal is on the track and in the box. It is possible that this common external input biases common motifs to emerge in both environments. Interestingly, the rats\u2019 rotation events consistently started and ended at the opening side, consistent with this idea that the initiation of common firing motifs could be triggered by common external visual cues. Furthermore, under the Blocked-view condition where there was a demonstrator on the track but external room cues and the demonstrator were invisible to the rat in the small box, cross-activation did not occur, supporting a crucial role of common visual cues in cross-activation. Presumably, cross-activation could occur during any active behavior when the rat is in the small box, as long as a demonstrator is present on the track and visible. However, given that no specific task is given to the rat in the box, the animal\u2019s behavior is mostly irregular whether or not the animal is facing the opening side, which renders mostly irregular CA1 activity patterns. But the small size of the box produces one active behavior that is relatively consistent across animals and sessions: rotation behavior. According to our interpretation that the firing of CA1 cells during rotation mainly results from 'squeezed' place cell activity, the cross-activation of track templates during rotation events suggests a topological similarity between firing motifs representing the track-running trajectories and the head movement trajectories in the box. This is consistent with the proposal that place cell patterns may encode common topology in seemingly very different environments (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dabaghian et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "Another important question is why cross-activation of common firing motifs occur in the box only when a demonstrator is visible on the track. One explanation is maybe related to the fact that the track is a separate environment from the box (both elevated from the floor). Without a demonstrator on the track, the track may appear as an object to the rat in the box and thus becomes part of the visual cues that drive the place cells in the box. When there is a demonstrator moving on the track, the rat in the box may 'realize' that the track is another space within the same room that can be explored. This sense of track as an explorable space might bias the drive to a subset of place cells in both the box and the track toward shared distal room cues, and lead to the emergence of common firing motifs and thus cross-activation. However, it remains unclear whether the actual moving of the demonstrator along the track is necessary for the rat in the small box to 'realize' that the track is explorable, or merely the presence of the demonstrator on the track, e.g. staying at one end of the track, may be sufficient. Interestingly, our data show that both a well-trained and a naive demonstrator are capable of triggering cross-activation, which suggests that cross-activation does not require precise behavioral performance of the demonstrator. Also, in our data we have not found any evidence that CA1 cells of the rat in the box responded to the demonstrator\u2019s positions on the track. Therefore, the rat in the box may not necessarily understand the precise action of the demonstrator, but the presence of the demonstrator itself is sufficient to signal the spatial nature of the track (instead of merely a visual cue in the room), which leads to the cross-activation. In this way, animals can learn about an environment, without actual self-exploration. Indeed, it is known that rodents can learn a variety of tasks by observing a conspecific (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zentall and Levine, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Leggio et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jeon et al., 2010</a>), but how they do so is unknown. One theory is that, instead of imitation learning that requires detailed understanding of conspecifics\u2019 actions, rodents rely on local enhancement or social facilitation as a general scheme of social learning (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heyes and Galef, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Zentall, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zajonc, 1965</a>). Our finding that cross-activation can be facilitated by both trained and na\u00efve conspecifics is consistent with the local enhancement theory and may provide a specific neural mechanism of local enhancement in social learning."

After 2\u20133 days\u2019 experience in the box with the presence of a well-trained demonstrator on the track, the animals\u2019 performance on the track is improved, compared to those animals staying in the box for 2\u20133 days without a demonstrator. More interestingly, their place fields during the first a few laps on the track seem already better tuned, suggesting that social observation facilitates the development of novel place fields. It is possible that this facilitation is related to the cross-activation in the box. However, a causal relationship between the two and how they are related to behavioral performance require further studies. Although ripple-associated replay may or may not take place prior to experience in other tasks (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Silva et al., 2015</a>), ripple replay does not occur in the box before the first self-running on the track and are similar across various box conditions in our experiment.

Previous studies find that introducing a rat to an open box induces no change or a small modification in CA1 place cell activities, but causes remapping of cells in the neighboring CA2 area (<a href=\"#bib34\">von Heimendahl et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 2016</a>). Whether the demonstrator causes CA1 place cells to remap in the small box was not directly investigated in our experiment. However, the fact that consistent place cell patterns occur within rotation events in the box under all box conditions suggests that the presence of a demonstrator per se would not dramatically alter place cell activities in the box, consistent with these previous studies. Instead, we found that cross-activation of common firing motifs emerges with the presence of a demonstrator on the track. This effect could be due to our task design of using a small box with one opening side, which boosts the impact of distal visual cues and the demonstrator on place cells in the box, an effort not made in previous studies. The unique influence of the demonstrator on cross-activation may come from the modification of upstream CA2 activities by social subjects. Future studies will reveal what factors and pathways are important to social influence of hippocampal place cell patterns and how they contributes to social behavior."

Within 3\u20134 weeks following the surgery, tetrodes were slowly advanced to the CA1 pyramidal layer until characteristic sharp-wave ripples were observed. The reference tetrode was placed in the white matter above the CA1. Recording started only after the tetrodes had not been moved for at least 24\u2009hours.

Both the box and the track were elevated ~50 cm from the floor. The box had opaque, high (40 cm) walls on three sides, leaving only one side open toward the track. A separate 60 cm (length) \u00d7 60 cm (width) \u00d7 100 cm (height) enclosed rest box was placed on a table ~1\u2009m away from the track. Animals were placed in a ceramic plate (20 cm in diameter) on top of a 30-cm tall flower pot, located at the center of the enclosed rest box. In the rest box, because animals\u2019 positions were limited in the plate, they spent time either circling around the plate or resting. The plexiglass box and the rest box were on different sides of the track. During recording experiments, the implanted rat was placed in the plexiglass box (referred to as the small box), where the rat could move freely and had full visual access to but no physical contact with the track, which was set up under several conditions (see below). When there was a demonstrator on the track, the demonstrator ran back and forth freely for milk reward at both ends.

All rats first went through a pre-recording training phase: Each rat was placed in the small box for 2 or 3 days, 15\u201330 min each day. For a group of 5 rats in this pre-recording exposure, there was a well-trained demonstrator running on the track. The demonstrator was a male conspecific (Long-Evans rat) of similar age to the recorded rat. The well-trained demonstrator had been pre-trained on the linear track to run back and forth for milk reward for at least 1 week. For the\u00a0other group of 4 implanted rats, the track was left empty without a demonstrator. Afterward, recording started and lasted for 6\u201312 consecutive days. On the first recording day, for the 5 rats that had seen a well-trained demonstrator in the training phase, CA1 neurons were recorded for 3 sessions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The rats first stayed in the small box while a well-trained demonstrator (Trained-demo) running the linear track for 15 min (Pre-box session). Then, they ran the track themselves for the first time (Track session), followed by staying in the small box again while the demonstrator running on the track (Post-box session). The recorded rats had never been exposed to the track before the first recording day. On each of the following days, we set up the track in box sessions with the following different conditions: removing the demonstrator on the track (Empty-track), removing both the track and demonstrator (No-track), replacing the demonstrator with a na\u00efve demonstrator that had never been exposed to the track (Na\u00efve-demo) or a remotely controlled toy car (Toy-car), or staying in the box but with the view blocked while a well-trained demonstrator running on the track (Blocked-view). For the Toy-car condition, the toy car was remotely controlled by the experimenter behind a curtain. It was maneuvered to move at a speed comparable to a rat\u2019s. At the end of the track, the toy car stopped and then reversed its direction. For the Blocked-view condition, the small box was rotated 180\u00b0 such that its opening side now facing a nearby wall of the room 20 cm away. Under this condition, the rat in the small box could not see either the track or the demonstrator, but had access to the auditory and olfactory information associated with the demonstrator. Each condition was recorded for 1\u20133 days. For the other group of 4 rats that had seen only the empty track in the pre-recording training, the box sessions on the first day were under Empty-track, followed by Trained-demo and other conditions. In this group of rats, we also added two 30\u00a0min rest sessions (Pre- and Post-rest sessions), either before the Pre-box session and after the Post-box session or before and after the Track session, when the animals were rest on the flower pot in the enclosed rest box. Furthermore, an additional group of 5 rats were not implanted with tetrodes (therefore not recorded), but were trained and tested with the same procedure described here. Four of these rats started with a 2\u20133 days\u2019 training using a well-trained demonstrator, followed by the daily 3-session (Pre-box, Track, Post-box) testing schedule for 2 days under Trained-demo, as in the recorded animals. The other rat went through the similar procedure but without a demonstrator (Empty-track). The behavioral data from these unrecorded rats in the Track sessions of these two days were included in the behavioral analysis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>)."

The stopping periods (&gt;3\u2009s of immobility) within these events were excluded from computing the firing rates. We defined common cells as those that were active both in the box and on the linear track. To quantify the significance of the proportion of common cells, we paired each box session (either Pre- or Post-box) with a running trajectory of the linear track on the same day. We then computed an 'actual proportion' of common cells active both in the rotation events in the box session and in the lap-running events on the track trajectory. Here we computed the proportions separately for the two track trajectories, because of the known fact that place cells are mostly directional on a track. Actual proportion was the proportion of common cells among all the cells active on the track trajectory.

We divided each trajectory into 2 cm spatial bins, with the reward sites (10 cm at both ends of the track) excluded, and then counted the number of spikes occurring within each bin. The spike counts were divided by occupancy time in each bin and smoothed by a Gaussian kernel with \u03c3 of two bins to generate a rate curve. The stopping periods within these events were excluded when computing the firing rates. Similarly, a circular rate curve was computed for each cell active in the box across all rotation events. A full circle (360\u00b0) was binned into 5\u00b0 arches. The firing rate of a cell in each arch was the spike count of the cell within the arch, divided by the occupancy time of the animal\u2019s head direction in the corresponding arch during rotation events. The circular rate curve was then smoothed by a Gaussian kernel with a \u03c3 of two arches. A circular rate curve was also generated for each individual rotation event. To quantify rotation consistency of a cell across rotation events, we computed a circular correlation between circular rate curves of any two individual rotation events and obtained the mean among the correlation values of all combination of individual rotation events in a box session (mean cross-event correlation). We then shuffled the circular rate cures of individual rotation events and generated 1000 sets of randomized curves. In this case, the circular rate curve of a rotation event was rotated by a random number of degrees between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0. The circular rate curves of all rotation events in a box session were independently rotated to obtain one set of randomized curve. We computed a mean cross-event correlation value for each set of randomized curves. Rotation-consistency of the cell was the z-score of the actual mean cross-event correlation relative to these shuffle-generated correlation values. Finally, a 2-dimensional (2D) rate map was generated for a cell active during rotation events in the box. In this case, we divided the 2D space into 1 \u00d7 1 cm grids and computed the cell\u2019s firing rate in each bin, and then smoothed the map by a Gaussian kernel with a \u03c3 of two bins."

To do so, we first identified those commons cells in a template that were active in a rotation event. If at least 5 active common cells were identified, we computed each cell\u2019s circular firing rate curve during the rotation event and ordered them into a sequence (rotation sequence), according to the angles of their peak rates relative to 0\u00b0. We next quantified how the rotation sequence matched to a trajectory template. Due to the circular nature of firing rate curves in a rotation event, we adopted a circular-shift strategy to quantify the match. Specifically, we circularly shifted the rotation sequence by one cell at a time and computed the similarity between each shifted rotation sequence and the trajectory template by using rank-order correlation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lee and Wilson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ji and Wilson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>). For example, if five common cells were ordered as 12345 as an initial rotation sequence, we generated a batch of circularly shifted sequences as 51234, 45123, and so on. The rank-order correlations could be either positive (if cells in a rotation sequence and a trajectory template had similar order) or negative (if cells in a rotation sequence and a trajectory template had opposite order). The maximum absolute rank-order correlation among the correlation values between all the shifted box sequences and the template was used as the match score."

We computed the spatial distance between the peaks and transformed it into a time gap, based on the mean running speed on the trajectory. We then rescaled the time gaps on the track, by a scale factor that rendered the mean temporal length of lap-running events to 1. To compute the time gap of a pair of cells within a rotation event, we first scaled the event time to a total length of 1. We then found the peak firing times of the two cells\u2019 spike activities within the event and took the time interval between the peaks as the time gap of the pair in the rotation event. We subtracted the two time gaps and averaged it over all pairs within a matching sequence to obtain a time gap difference for each matching sequence.

In this experiment both the box and track sequences occur on the same 'clock'- the theta rhythm. Thus if the box sequences are being used to code for space on the track it would be expected that not just the mere order, but also the temporal aspects of the assembly would be preserved. This could be examined various ways, one possible approach would be to apply Bayesian decoding, based on the decoded positions on the track, to estimate trajectories encode during the circling-related discharges in the box (similar to Silva et al., Nature Neuroscience, Dec 2015). This would allow for the classification of the events as true trajectory events (based on high correlation/low error) and quantitative assessment of the similarity of the trajectory sequences based on parameters such as maximum jump distance and absolute correlation (see Silva et al., Nature Neuro, Dec 2015)."

This is key to understanding if the sequences are specific to the track the demonstrator rat is exploring (context specificity), as well the possibility that any social cue alters the strength or duration of the putative plasticity linking the sequence of active neurons in the box, thus altering the probability of the neurons maintaining some order in the subsequent context.

Thus if the box sequences are being used to code for space on the track it would be expected that not just the mere order, but also the temporal aspects of the assembly would be preserved. This could be examined various ways, one possible approach would be to apply Bayesian decoding, based on the decoded positions on the track, to estimate trajectories encode during the circling-related discharges in the box (similar to Silva et al., Nature Neuroscience, Dec 2015). This would allow for the classification of the events as true trajectory events (based on high correlation/low error) and quantitative assessment of the similarity of the trajectory sequences based on parameters such as maximum jump distance and absolute correlation (see Silva et al., Nature Neuro, Dec 2015).</i> "

We have performed new analysis to address this question. Because the circular nature of the firing sequences in the box complicates the Bayesian detection of trajectory events, we opted to directly compute firing time gaps of place cells with neighboring place fields on the track. We quantified the difference between these gaps on the track and their time gaps within firing sequences of rotation events in the box. This actual difference was then compared with what would be expected if the firing times of cells within rotation events were randomly shifted but with firing orders maintained. The result (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4 \u2014figure supplement 2</a>) shows that the actual differences were not significantly smaller than the differences obtained by randomly shifted sequences. We believe this is an expected result, because moving speed in both the lap-running events on the track and the rotation events in the box were not constant. As a result, even though lap running and rotation events use the same theta clock, the number of theta cycles between any two cells were different."
