To test the roles of responses to                    environmental cues and sexual behaviors in longevity regulation, we examined                        <i>Caenorhabditis</i> male lifespan under solitary, grouped, and                    mated conditions. We find that neurons and the germline are required for male                    pheromone-dependent male death. Hermaphrodites with a masculinized nervous                    system secrete male pheromone and are susceptible to male pheromone killing.                    Male pheromone-mediated killing is unique to androdioecious                        <i>Caenorhabditis</i>, and may reduce the number of males in                    hermaphroditic populations; neither males nor females of gonochoristic species                    are susceptible to male pheromone killing. By contrast, mating-induced death,                    which is characterized by germline-dependent shrinking, glycogen loss, and                    ectopic vitellogenin expression, utilizes distinct molecular pathways and is                    shared between the sexes and across species. The study of sex- and                    species-specific regulation of aging reveals deeply conserved mechanisms of                    longevity and population structure regulation."
