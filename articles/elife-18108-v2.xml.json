                    "text": "Notch signaling plays a crucial role in controling the proliferation and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells during embryogenesis or organogenesis, but its regulation is incompletely understood. BLOS2, encoded by the <i>Bloc1s2</i> gene, is a shared subunit of two lysosomal trafficking complexes, biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1) and BLOC-1-related complex (BORC). <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mice were embryonic lethal and exhibited defects in cortical development and hematopoiesis. Loss of BLOS2 resulted in elevated Notch signaling, which consequently increased the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and inhibited neuronal differentiation in cortices. Likewise, ablation of <i>bloc1s2</i> in zebrafish or mice led to increased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell production in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. BLOS2 physically interacted with Notch1 in endo-lysosomal trafficking of Notch1. Our findings suggest that BLOS2 is a novel negative player in regulating Notch signaling through lysosomal trafficking to control multiple stem and progenitor cell homeostasis in vertebrates."

BLOS2, encoded by the <i>Bloc1s2</i> gene, is a shared subunit of two lysosomal trafficking complexes, biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1) and BLOC-1-related complex (BORC). <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mice were embryonic lethal and exhibited defects in cortical development and hematopoiesis. Loss of BLOS2 resulted in elevated Notch signaling, which consequently increased the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and inhibited neuronal differentiation in cortices. Likewise, ablation of <i>bloc1s2</i> in zebrafish or mice led to increased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell production in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. BLOS2 physically interacted with Notch1 in endo-lysosomal trafficking of Notch1. Our findings suggest that BLOS2 is a novel negative player in regulating Notch signaling through lysosomal trafficking to control multiple stem and progenitor cell homeostasis in vertebrates."

Cortical neurogenesis requires the exquisite coordination of neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation and differentiation to generate the complex and functional cerebral cortex, which is precisely regulated in temporal and spatial patterns (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gal et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Guillemot, 2005</a>). Notch signaling plays a crucial role in the control of proliferation of NPCs and neuronal differentiation during corticogenesis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fortini, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Pierfelice et al., 2011</a>). Notch signals activate the\u00a0expression of basic helix loop helix (bHLH) Hes transcription factors that maintain undifferentiated NPCs\u00a0by downregulating proneural gene expression (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertrand et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kageyama et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ohtsuka et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Ross et al., 2003</a>). The neurogenic transition occurs through stable downregulation of Notch target genes, leading to upregulation of proneural genes and neuronal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kawaguchi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Shimojo et al., 2008</a>). Hyperactivation of Notch signaling, such as that\u00a0due to loss of Numb and Numblike, results in neural progenitor hyperproliferation and impaired neuronal differentiation in the mouse brain (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hoeck et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rodriguez et al., 2012</a>)."

Therefore, tight spatio-temporal regulation of Notch activity that\u00a0determines its location, strength and duration is essential for the homeostasis and differentiation of NPCs or HSPCs.

The endocytic trafficking of Notch receptor results in either transportation to lysosomes for degradation via multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs) and late endosomes or recycling back to the plasma membrane for ligand binding and activation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Le Borgne, 2006</a>). When endocytic trafficking of Notch receptor destined for lysosomal degradation is disrupted, Notch receptor accumulates in endosomes and\u00a0undergoes proteolytic cleavage and ectopic activation in a ligand-independent manner (<a href=\"#bib14\">Furthauer and Gonzalez-Gaitan, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Moberg et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Thompson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Vaccari and Bilder, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Vaccari et al., 2008</a>). In <i>Drosophila,</i> Deltex interacts with another E3 ubiquitin ligase, Su(Dx), to activate ligand-independent Notch proteolysis and signaling (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cornell et al., 1999</a>). The HOPS and AP-3 complex are required for the Deltex-regulated activation of Notch in the endosomal trafficking pathway (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wilkin et al., 2008</a>). Beyond flies, several mammalian proteins have been identified as regulators of Notch lysosomal degradation through the vacuolar H(+) ATPase (<a href=\"#bib11\">Faronato et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kobia et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lange et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sethi et al., 2010</a>).

We counted the number of Pax6<sup>+</sup> radial glia/apical progenitors in <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> and WT animals. Pax6 immunostaining on coronal sections from E14.5 brains revealed a 52% increase in Pax6<sup>+</sup> cells in the mutant when compared with the WT, suggesting that the functional loss of BLOS2 results in an increase in the proliferation of Pax6<sup>+</sup> radial glia cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G and H</a>). Moreover, we administered a 2-hr BrdU pulse to pregnant dams at E14.5 to label all cells in S phase and measured the ratio of cycling cells that were in S phase in WT and <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>animals (<a href=\"#bib61\">Siegenthaler et al., 2009</a>).

Furthermore, neural precursor proliferation was also assessed using the mitotic marker phosphohistone-3 (PH3) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rash et al., 2011</a>).

Notch signaling plays central roles in the coordination of proliferation of NPCs and neuronal differentiation during neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fortini, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</a>). Moreover, overexpression of transcription factors Hes1 and Hes5, which mediate Notch signaling, results in neural progenitor hyperproliferation and impaired neuronal differentiation in the brain (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ohtsuka et al., 2001</a>). Similarly, loss of Numb and Numblike in dorsal forebrain leads to the hyperactivation of Notch signaling, increases neural progenitor proliferation, delays cell cycle exit and inhibits neuronal differentiation, mimicking the <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> phenotypes in NPCs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 2003a</a>)."

Immunoblotting analyses of cortex extracts derived from <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>mutants and WT littermates showed that the <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>cortices contained higher levels of NICD1 than WT animals, indicative of elevated Notch signaling. Likewise, we found an increase in the level of Notch1 transmembrane subunit (N<sup>TM</sup>) in the mutant cortex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>). Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Notch1 was mainly detected in the ventricular and subventricular areas. In E14.5 <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>animals, Notch1 intensity was increased compared to the controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a>). The elevated level of Notch1 (N<sup>TM</sup>) in <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>animals potentially explained their higher level of NICD1. To exclude the possibility of higher expression of Notch ligands in mutant mice, Delta-like 1(Dll1) and Jagged1 (Jag1), two Notch ligands reported to be expressed in neural progenitors, were examined and there was no difference between WT and <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>cortices (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>).

We found that <i>bloc1s2</i> was expressed in neurons and vessels (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), especially in endothelial cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), which indicates a potential role of <i>bloc1s2</i> in zebrafish hematopoiesis. To study its function in zebrafish, <i>bloc1s2</i> mutants were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 systems. The gRNA was designed to target 3 of the 4 <i>bloc1s2</i> transcripts (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), and the expression of <i>bloc1s2</i> was significantly decreased, but not abolished\u00a0because\u00a0of the expression of transcript <i>bloc1s2-201</i> in the <i>bloc1s2</i> mutant fish, which we designated as a hypomorphic mutant, <i>bloc1s2 hypo</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> to <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a> to <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). To explore the function of\u00a0<i>bloc1s2</i>\u00a0in zebrafish hematopoiesis, we examined the expression of HSPC markers in the AGM region of <i>bloc1s2</i> mutants. Strikingly, we found that the protein level of Runx1 was increased in <i>bloc1s2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In addition, the mRNA expression of <i>runx1</i> and <i>cmyb</i> (another HSPC marker) was also increased in the AGM region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E and F</a>). To further confirm this HSPC phenotype, <i>bloc1s2</i> homozygous mutants were outcrossed with the\u00a0Tg(<i>flk1</i>:mcherry;<i>cmyb</i>:GFP) transgenic line, and finally we obtained the <i>bloc1s2</i> homozygotes in the\u00a0Tg(<i>flk1</i>:mcherry;<i>cmyb</i>:GFP) background. Confocal imaging showed an increased number of hemogenic endothelium (HE) and emerging HSPCs in the <i>bloc1s2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Moreover, the increased expression of HSPC markers (<i>runx1</i> and <i>cmyb</i>) in <i>bloc1s2</i> mutants was rescued by overexpression of <i>bloc1s2</i> itself (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C and D</a>), indicating the specific function of <i>bloc1s2</i> in HSPC development."

As expected, the BrdU signals around the dorsal aorta were significantly increased (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

However, Notch1 (N<sup>TM</sup>) degradation was suppressed by MG132 in <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>MEFs, similar to the effect in WT MEFs, implying that the proteasomal pathway of Notch1 (N<sup>TM</sup>) degradation is not affected by loss of BLOS2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C and D</a>). These results suggest that BLOS2 is probably required for lysosomal degradation of Notch1 (N<sup>TM</sup>)."

We first performed a 5\u201320% (w/v) OptiPrep gradient separation of the homogenates of WT and <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>brains (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zhang et al., 2014b</a>). Using organellar markers, EEA1 (early endosomes), CD63 (MVBs and late endosomes), LAMP1 (lysosomes), and GM130 (Golgi), we observed that the localization of Notch1 (N<sup>TM</sup>) exhibited a marked increase in the EEA1 and CD63-labeled fractions in <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>brains compared to WT, indicative of accumulation of Notch1 (N<sup>TM</sup>) in endosomes with loss of BLOS2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a>). We further examined Notch1 receptor localization by co-labeling cells with Notch1 and markers of endosomes and lysosomes (EEA1, LBPA and LAMP1) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Delevoye et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tomas et al., 2015</a>). Compared to WT cells, we observed slightly increased endogenous Notch1 localization in EEA1-labeled early endosomes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C and F</a>) and significantly increased localization in LBPA-labeled MVBs and late endosomes in <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>MEFs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D and G</a>). Using structured illumination microscopy (SIM), we confirmed the accumulation of Notch1 receptor in LBPA-positive vesicles in <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>MEFs (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, we did not observe apparent accumulation of Notch1 in <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> MEFs labeled with internalized TfA568 after treatment for 30\u2009min representing recycling endosomes (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Delevoye et al., 2016</a>). By contrast, loss of BLOS2 resulted in a significantly decreased Notch1 localization in LAMP1-labeled lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E and H</a>). These results suggested that the endo-lysosomal trafficking of Notch1 receptor is altered in <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>MEFs, and that the accumulated Notch1 in the endosomes promotes its signaling."

(<b>C</b>) A proposed model. In WT cells, BLOS2 is required for the lysosomal degradation of Notch1. The Notch1 receptor is endocytosed to early endosomes, where the receptor is either trafficked back to the membrane by recycling endosomes or it is directed to lysosomal degradation through MVBs and late endosomes. However, in the mutant cells, loss of BLOS2 results in impaired endo-lysosomal trafficking of Notch1. Consequently, a large fraction of Notch1 accumulates in the MVBs and late endosomes, where active NICD1 (red) is produced. This enhanced activation of Notch signaling probably causes the defective embryonic corticogenesis in the mutant mice. PM, plasma membrane; EE, early endosome; MVB, multivesicular bodies."

In WT cells, Notch1 receptor is endocytosed to early endosomes, where the receptor is either trafficked back to the membrane by recycling endosomes or directed to lysosomal degradation through MVBs and late endosomes. In mutant cells, loss of BLOS2 resulted in impaired endo-lysosomal trafficking of Notch1, which consequently caused the accumulation of a large fraction of Notch1 in the MVBs and late endosomes. The hyperactivation of Notch signaling led to the defective embryonic corticogenesis and hematopoiesis in the <i>Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> </i>mutants. We also observed interaction between BLOS2 and Notch1, suggesting that BLOS2 most probably mediates endo-lysosomal trafficking of Notch1 (a model in <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Lysosomal degradation of Notch receptors prevents ectopic Notch activation by turning off the signals. Our observation that BLOS2 functions as a negative regulator of Notch signaling provides new mechanistic insights into the fine-tuning of Notch signaling by endo-lysosomal trafficking."

More profound effects could also\u00a0be explained under this mechanistic controlling of Notch signaling. For example, previous studies have shown that Notch signaling plays important roles in the development of the neural crest and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bao and Cepko, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lee et al., 2005</a>). Abnormal eye pigmentation and craniofacial malformation in Bloc1s2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice, as described in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> could well be attributable to the disruption of Notch signaling during neural crest development.

Recent studies have shown that endo-lysosomal trafficking of the Notch receptor plays important roles in the regulation of Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fortini, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Yamamoto et al., 2010</a>). Endocytic trafficking has been considered to play a negative role in signaling pathways by transporting Notch receptor to lysosomes for degradation. Also, endocytic trafficking is important for the activation of Notch signaling, which may occur not only on the cell membrane but also in endocytosed vesicles or endosomes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hori et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sorkin and von Zastrow, 2009</a>). Accumulation of Notch receptor in endosomes, caused by mutations in genes involved in endo-lysosomal trafficking, leads to ectopic activation of Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fortini and Bilder, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Furthauer and Gonzalez-Gaitan, 2009</a>). Several proteins\u00a0that\u00a0are involved in endo-lysosomal trafficking, such as endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complexes, lethal (2) giant discs (lgd), the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex, and the AP-3 complex, have been shown to regulate Notch signaling in flies (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jaekel and Klein, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Moberg et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Thompson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Vaccari and Bilder, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Vaccari et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib73\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Wilkin et al., 2008</a>). To our knowledge, this is the first report in\u00a0which developmental defects of these endo-lysosomal trafficking complexes in vertebrates have\u00a0been\u00a0attributed to upregulated Notch signaling. Interestingly, loss of lgd function leads to ectopic upregulation of Notch signaling, and lgd specifically acts on Notch endo-lysosomal trafficking (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jaekel and Klein, 2006</a>). We\u00a0could\u00a0speculate that BLOS2 may play a similar role in association with lgd by functioning as an adaptor of ESCRTs in vertebrates. BLOS2 is a shared subunit of BLOC-1 and BORC (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pu et al., 2015</a>). Although BLOC-1 and BORC have been implicated in endo-lysosomal trafficking (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ji et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Pu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Zhang et al., 2014a</a>), our results have shown that BLOS2 probably\u00a0regulates Notch signaling independently of BLOC-1 or BORC. Loss of BLOS2 leads to the accumulation of Notch in the endosomes. In comparison, when another BLOC-1 subunit (BLOS1 or snapin)\u00a0is deficient, EGFR or D2R is accumulated in the plasma membrane, where EGF or D2 signaling is upregulated in a ligand-depend manner (<a href=\"#SD24-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ji et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Zhang et al., 2014a</a>). The interesting point here is that the mechanism utilized by BLOS2 specifically regulates Notch1, but is not a general mechanism for lysosomal degradation of other endocytosed receptors, such as EGFR. There could be several hypotheses to explain this. First, different interacting partners of BLOC-1 subunits operate\u00a0to expand their involvement in different pathways. Our recent results have shown that different subunits of BLOC-1, such as dysbindin, muted, and BLOS1, may have unique functions in lysosomal trafficking (e.g. in\u00a0endo-lysosomal trafficking, LRO biogenesis, and autophagy) mediated by specific interacting partners (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hao et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yuan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Zhang et al., 2014a</a>). In addition, BLOS2 may have a function in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sun et al., 2008</a>). Second, the residual activity of the destabilized subunit outside of BLOC-1 may function in some way that is different from a null mutation itself, suggesting that phenotypes are differentially sensitive to genetic dosages of loss-of-function BLOC-1 alleles (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mullin et al., 2015</a>)."

HSPCs are now widely used in transplantation to cure multiple diseases. Inability of the donors to provide sufficient HSPCs makes it urgent to produce HSPCs ex vivo or in vitro. Our results revealed the inhibitory role of BLOS2 in HSPC production. Manipulations of BLOS2 expression in HSPCs may therefore\u00a0have\u00a0practical implications. Downregulation of BLOS2 by genome-editing of HSPCs might facilitate its production, which is highly demanded in clinical applications. By contrast, overexpression of BLOS2 promoted HSPC differentiation, which may improve the differentiation efficiency. Interestingly, the differentiation activity of excessive HSPCs was abnormal as they generated more T cells at the expense of erythroid and myeloid differentiation. This phenotype is similar to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), which is also caused by the hyperactivation of the\u00a0Notch signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib70\">Tzoneva and Ferrando, 2012</a>). The mimicking T-ALL phenotypes in BLOS2 knockouts have provided potential zebrafish or mouse models of T-ALL for clinical investigation. In addition, modulation of BLOS2 or the lysosomal degradation pathway may serve as a potential therapeutic target in controlling T-ALL progression in patients."

The authors report perturbations in developmental neurogenesis and hematopoiesis in Blos1s2 KO mice that mimic Notch mutations, leading them to investigate the impact of BLOS2 on Notch signaling. In a heterologous cell system (MEFs), they demonstrate that proteosomal degradation of Notch is impeded in the absence of BLOS2, leading to enhanced Notch signaling. They also show that Notch1 and Blos2 are found in complex and can be colocalized in endosomal compartments. Based on these data and insights from previous publications in <i>Drosophila</i>, the authors propose that in the absence of BLOS2, Notch1 gets activated in a \"ligand independent manner\" in this compartment. Interestingly, the authors further examined mutant/KO mouse lines that are defective in other components of the BLOC-1 and/or BORC complex and find that these animals do not phenocopy the neuronal defect (as well as the Notch1 accumulation phenotype in MEF cells) seen in BLOS2 KO mice. Based on these findings, the authors propose that the function of BLOS2 in Notch signaling is independent of its proposed function in the BLOS1-1/BORC complex."
