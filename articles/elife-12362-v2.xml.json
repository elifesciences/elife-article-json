Its specificity is dependent upon conformational changes that take place within its aptamer domain. Here, the role of tertiary interactions in ligand binding was studied at the single-molecule level by combined force spectroscopy and F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), using an optical trap equipped for simultaneous smFRET. The \u2018Force-FRET\u2019 approach directly probes secondary and tertiary structural changes during folding, including events associated with binding. Concurrent transitions observed in smFRET signals and RNA extension revealed differences in helix-arm orientation between two previously-identified ligand-binding states that had been undetectable by spectroscopy alone. Our results show that the weaker binding state is able to bind to TPP, but is unable to form a tertiary docking interaction that completes the binding process. Long-range tertiary interactions stabilize global riboswitch structure and confer increased ligand specificity."

The genetic code in the mRNA is then translated into a protein. There are also untranslated regions within mRNAs that do not code for protein themselves, but serve to regulate whether or not a protein is produced from the rest of the mRNA. For example, many mRNAs contain a motif in their untranslated region called a 'riboswitch'. These motifs selectively bind to molecules that are the products of metabolic processes. One riboswitch found in bacteria, animals and plants binds to a molecule known as thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and regulates genes that control the uptake of a vitamin called thiamine into cells."

The experiments show that in the presence of TPP, structural changes occur in two arm-like appendages \u2013 known as helix arms \u2013 that extend out of the core of the riboswitch. The riboswitch adopts a particular shape when TPP is strongly bound to it, and in this shape the riboswitch can regulate the activity of certain genes. However, if the riboswitch is only weakly associated with TPP, it takes on a shape in which the two helix arms are further apart and the riboswitch is unable to form the interactions required to complete the process of binding to TPP."

Riboswitch aptamers fold and then bind their cognate ligands in a highly specific manner, and as they do so, they compete with alternative RNA structures that can form in conjunction with other domains of the riboswitch, which function either to permit, or to prevent, downstream gene expression. The aptamer of the TPP riboswitch senses the abundance of the coenzyme thiamine pyrophosphate, and in response, reduces the uptake of the vitamin thiamine. Versions of the TPP riboswitch have been discovered in all three kingdoms of life (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cheah et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Sudarsan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Winkler et al., 2002</a>). In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, the TPP aptamer is located upstream of the 3\u2032 untranslated intron region of the <i>thiC</i> gene, and it contains a complementary sequence that, in the absence of TPP, acts to sequester a downstream splice site: it therefore functions by modulating alternative gene splicing (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wachter et al., 2007</a>)."

The existence of the folded states was inferred from measurements of the molecular extension of the aptamer as a function of the external force applied (force-extension curves, or FECs) during mechanically-induced unfolding. FECs obtained for the binding of TPP in the weakly bound, intermediate F\u2032 state were strikingly similar to FECs measured for the complete binding of two TPP analogs, thiamine monophosphate (TMP) or thiamine (T). These analogs lack one or both phosphate groups, respectively, resulting in incomplete binding to the bipartite ligand-binding site, which normally forms contacts with both the thiamine and phosphate moieties. Similar FECs were also measured for TPP binding by a mutant aptamer (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anthony et al., 2012</a>) that is unable to form tertiary contacts between the two arms carrying L5 and P3. Taken together, these observations are consistent with two nonexclusive possibilities for the structure of the F\u2032\u2022TPP intermediate: (1) TPP may be incompletely coordinated at the binding site in this aptamer form, or (2) the aptamer structure may not have brought together its L5 and P3 arms, whose docking may be required for strong binding and the transition to the F\u2033\u2022TPP state."

                                "text": "Using a dual-beam optical trap, we applied controlled loads to each end of an individual TPP aptamer RNA (3\u2032 and 5\u2032), and measured the end-to-end extension during mechanical unfolding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Tertiary interactions were simultaneously scored by a FRET readout between donor and acceptor fluorescent dyes, ATTO550 and ATTO647N (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), which were covalently attached to the L5 and P3 helix arms, respectively. Aptamers were subjected to repeated cycles of unfolding and refolding. After a preliminary unfolding of the RNA, the optical traps were brought into close proximity, which reduced the applied load below 5.0 pN for a time of 0.5\u201330\u2009s, allowing the aptamer to refold under low force (the refolding step). The force was subsequently ramped up by increasing the trap separation linearly at 200 nm/s (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>), as both molecular extension and fluorescence signals were acquired. After full extension, the refolding/unfolding cycle was repeated, until either a dye photobleached or the RNA tether broke. As reported previously, FECs could be categorized into one of three distinct forms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A,B,C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anthony et al., 2012</a>), each corresponding to a different folded conformation, as follows. In the absence of TPP, FECs for the folded aptamer (F) displayed three opening transitions, or rips, corresponding to the sequential rupture of the secondary structural elements (P1 + P2), P4/5 and the P3 stem, respectively. In the presence of TPP, two additional FEC forms were observed: (1) an FEC with a single opening transition at low force (&lt;20 pN),\u00a0sometimes followed by an\u00a0additional opening transition, that corresponds to the weakly bound state, F\u2032\u2022TPP, and (2) an FEC with a single, high-force\u00a0(&gt;20\u00a0pN) transition, that corresponds to the tightly bound, fully folded state, F\u2033\u2022TPP. FRET signals acquired during force ramps could be categorized into three groups, with characteristics that were attributable to each of the three established aptamer conformations, F, F\u2032\u2022TPP, and F\u2033\u2022TPP. In the absence of TPP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), the FRET efficiency of the F state remained stable near a low value under reduced loads, and then dropped abruptly to near zero upon the first opening transition, as the duplex elements P1 and P2 unfolded. In the presence of TPP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), the FRET efficiency of F\u2032\u2022TPP started out with a similar low value, but then transitioned to an intermediate level which was not observed in the absence of ligand, until the elements P1, P2 and P4/5 unfolded together, resulting in an abrupt drop to near zero. This transition was followed by a very tiny rip, barely\u00a0detectable in the FEC, but not producing any further change in FRET, that corresponded to the unfolding of P3 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anthony et al., 2012</a>). By contrast, FRET signals for F\u2033\u2022TPP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) first jumped from a low to an intermediate FRET level (the same two levels, on average, displayed by F\u2032\u2022TPP), but later transitioned to a high FRET level, characterized by a comparatively low variance, until the final opening transition, corresponding to the unfolding of the entire aptamer, which returned the FRET level to the baseline."

Mean values returned from the Gaussian fits, G1, G2 and G3, were statistically consistent with mean values for opening FRET computed for the C1, C2 and C3 clusters. By matching the FRET sub-populations against conformations previously characterized by force assignment, we could infer the P3-L5 arm configurations, independent of force. The lowest-valued FRET sub-population, corresponding to the APO state, reflects a significant physical separation between the P3 stem and L5 loop, which remain consistently apart. The intermediate-value FRET sub-population, corresponding to the WB (weakly bound) state, reflects more proximal stem-loop interactions. The highest-value FRET population, corresponding to the SB (strongly bound) state, reflects the close apposition of P3 and L5. To characterize further P3-L5 arm behavior, we used the cluster thresholds established for refolding to categorize segments of FEC records obtained at forces up to 10 pN (i.e., prior to the first opening transition), including the refolding portion, as follows. Segments of FRET trajectories below 0.57, or above 0.74, which tended to exhibit comparatively lower variance, were assigned to the APO or SB states, respectively. FRET trajectories between these values were assigned to the higher-variance, WB state (such trajectories included short intervals where the FRET value made brief excursions above or below the threshold levels, but never remained consistently out-of-range for more than one or two consecutive time points). Thus separated, the individual FRET data were binned into histograms for the corresponding APO, WB, and SB states (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

In support of this notion, force spectroscopy has previously established that FECs of the aptamer bound by such analogs closely resemble those corresponding to the weakly bound, F\u2032\u2022TPP conformation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anthony et al., 2012</a>). We collected data for both FECs and FRET trajectories for aptamer binding in the presence of TMP, T, and in the absence of ligand, and applied the same clustering formalism as for aptamer binding in the presence of TPP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). FRET trajectories acquired in the absence of ligand exhibited a low efficiency (mean = 0.46), and closely matched those assigned earlier to the APO state, which had been observed in the presence of TPP, but prior to presumed ligand binding, lending additional experimental support to that assignment. Aptamers bound to either TMP or T generated FECs similar to those previously observed, and closely resembled the weakly bound conformation in the presence of TPP, as anticipated. The FRET efficiencies were similar for both T and TMP ligands (means = 0.64 and 0.69, respectively). However, both these values are significantly lower than the efficiency of the WB state obtained in the presence of TPP (mean = 0.73). Because the opening transitions in FECs tend to be dominated by secondary structure, whereas the FRET signal reports a tertiary rearrangement, we conclude that aptamers bound to TMP or T share a similar secondary structure with the aptamer weakly bound to TPP, but differ in tertiary structure: specifically, the analogs TMP and T fail to bring the helix arms together as closely as TPP."

FRET values and directional transition rates were obtained at TPP concentrations of both 5 \u00b5M and 50 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6B,C</a>). The corresponding values for FRET states identified by hidden Markov modeling were identical, within statistical error, at both TPP concentrations, and notably, also within statistical error for the corresponding states identified using <i>k</i>-means cluster analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We were therefore able to make a direct correspondence between the HMM-identified states (called A, B, and C) and the clustered FRET states (Apo, WB, and SB, respectively). At the higher TPP concentration, all transition rates except for the A \u2192 B rate remained the same within error, implying that only this transition, corresponding to the Apo \u2192 WB transition, is TPP-dependent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The inferred dependence is also consistent with the kinetic model proposed on the basis of force spectroscopy, where only the transition between states F\u2032 and F\u2032\u2032\u2022TPP is TPP-dependent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and 7B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anthony et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, both FRET and force data support a sequential, four-state kinetic model. However, the transition rates obtained using the HMM approach are consistently faster than the rates previously derived from force spectroscopy alone. Specifically, at the high TPP concentration, the lifetime in the A state was vanishingly short, and only a single dwell interval was scored by the HMM procedure. Instead, the vast majority of records (<i>N</i> = 52 of 53) started out in state B, and thereafter made subsequent transitions between B and C states. We conclude that the A \u2192 B transition rate at the higher TPP concentration is likely faster than our detection capability, and that the apparent 4-fold increase in this transition rate should be taken as a lower bound."

The eukaryotic aptamer folds quickly into a stable form, where the P3-L5 arm configuration remains open, as indicated by the stable, low FRET trajectories recorded in the absence of ligand (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2F\u2013H</a>). By contrast, <a href=\"#bib14\">Haller et al. (2013)</a> reported that, in the absence of ligand, the arms of the bacterial form of the TPP aptamer interchange rapidly among three FRET states, as fit by a hidden Markov model, with dwell times around 100 ms (<a href=\"#bib14\">Haller et al., 2013</a>). The slightly slower imaging rate employed here (20 frames/s, vs. ~50\u2013100 frames/s) should still have been adequate to detect any comparable flickering, in principle, but none was evident in our records. The eukaryotic aptamer is therefore structurally more stable in its unbound form (or conceivably, it switches among configurations, but at a significantly faster rate). We note that the two TPP aptamers differ primarily in their P3 stem regions: the bacterial form lacks a distal P3 extension that is present in the eukaryotic form, and this longer element may exert a stabilizing role on the unbound aptamer."

Transitions out of the WB state were generally irreversible, and these led directly to the SB state, which was characterized by a stable, high FRET level with significantly lower variance. We therefore interpret the SB configuration as one where the two helix arms are fully docked, forming a tight, stable P3-L5 tertiary interaction. Based upon the data, the WB state can be interpreted as one where the P3 and L5 arms are partially docked, that is, they remain mobile but closer, on average, than in the APO state. Alternatively, the WB state might represent a superposition of (less individually flexible) docked and undocked conformations that interchange rapidly on the timescale of our data acquisition, at rates &gt;&gt;20\u2009s<sup>-1</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

The binding site of the aptamer, located at the central junction of the arms, is bipartite, and is able to bind to the thiamine moiety of TPP on one side, and to phosphate groups on the other. One previous study of T and TMP, which lack one and two phosphate groups, respectively, and therefore bind to only one side of the site, concluded that the lack of phosphates prevents proper alignment of the P3-L5 arms and ultimately, docking (<a href=\"#bib24\">Noeske et al., 2006</a>). For both bound analogs, the mean FRET efficiencies were smaller than the corresponding FRET efficiency of the SB state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These results imply that the sensor helix arms spend most of their time farther apart when bound to TMP or T than when bound to TPP in the F\u2033\u2022TPP conformation. We surmise that each additional phosphate group serves to draw the arms closer together during ligand binding, and is responsible for the observed increase in FRET. Perhaps more surprisingly, the FRET trajectories for the aptamer after binding onto TMP and T are stable and low in variance, suggesting that although the P3-L5 structures are unable to dock, they remain in a stable configuration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5C and 5D</a>). This trend is reflected in the FRET variance obtained during force ramp, which is low at 0.005 and 0.003 for T and TMP, respectively, but significantly larger at 0.010 for the WB FRET state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5B and 5D</a>). This result implies that when the aptamer is bound to T or TMP, the arms are less dynamic than when the aptamer is bound to TPP in the F\u2032\u2022TPP conformation. Taken together, these data suggest that aptamer binding of TPP in the F\u2032\u2022TPP conformation is a state in which the helix arms are in close proximity due to the presence of two phosphate groups, yet exhibit significant flexibility. This flexibility appears to be essential for proper orientation of the helix arms, which primes the arms to dock and the aptamer to adopt the F\u2033\u2022TPP conformation."

We observed a rather rigid helix arm configuration during the fully folded, APO state, in contrast to the dynamic helix arm behavior reported for the <i>E. coli</i> TPP riboswitch in the absence of TPP. Upon TPP binding, we observed an increase in helix arm dynamics in the WB state, which is also in contrast to bacterial studies that observed a reduction of arm dynamics upon ligand binding. Our observations of FRET trajectories suggest that helix-arm fluctuations occur at significantly faster rates than any secondary structural changes. Based on our data, we conclude that both secondary and tertiary interactions are vital to tight TPP binding. We speculate that in the eukaryotic aptamer, ligand binding first anchors the lower regions of the helix arms, inducing strains that lead to fluctuations in the more distal regions. Such fluctuations increase the frequency of contact between the P3-L5 arms, and thereby increase the probability of docking, lowering the binding energy further. Future studies using additional FRET probes, and conducted at even higher time resolution, should be able to probe independently the motions of the lower aptamer regions."

However, it has become clear that even minor structural differences between forms can yield distinct properties. For example, the comparatively longer and more stable P3 stem found in the eukaryotic riboswitch leads to slower arm dynamics, as expected, with wide-ranging consequences. But piecing together a more detailed, quantitative picture of the folding landscape, which includes strain-dependent ligand binding and the formation of tertiary contacts during helix-arm docking, requires special methodology, such as the combination of fluorescence and force spectroscopy pursued here. It is still early days, but we anticipate that the combined force-FRET technique will be a powerful tool for elucidating riboswitch function across all kingdoms of life."

Briefly, the setup (schematic; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) is based on a Nikon TE2000 inverted light microscope\u00a0(Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY), and utilizes three lasers: one for optical trapping (10W; 1,064 nm; diode-pumped Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> laser; Spectra-Physics Lasers, Mountain View, CA), one for position detection (20 mW; 830 nm; single-mode diode laser; Qioptiq,\u00a0Waltham,\u00a0MA), and one for fluorescence excitation (1 W; 532 nm; diode-pumped, frequency-doubled YAG; CrystaLaser,\u00a0Reno,\u00a0NV). Fluorescence emission was detected by an electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD) camera used for imaging (iXon 897; Andor,\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom). Fluorescence excitation light was coupled into, and focused through, the microscope objective to a ~1 \u03bcm spot in the specimen plane, confocal with the fluorescently-labeled RNA construct. Dichroic filters were installed upstream of the EMCCD to split the emission spectra of the donor and acceptor fluorophores into spatially separate channels at the image plane; the emission image was passed through a rectangular slit to allow simultaneous collection from both acceptor and the donor fluorophores."

Opening forces and extensions were measured by first identifying transitions in the FECs, then fitting the regions before and after these to a double wormlike chain model (WLC), as described (<a href=\"#bib13\">Greenleaf et al., 2008</a>). For smFRET traces, correction factors for the leakage of donor emission into the acceptor channel (<i>\u03b2</i>) and differences between the donor and acceptor in efficiency and quantum yield (<i>\u03b3)</i> were calculated as described (<a href=\"#bib22\">McCann et al., 2010</a>).

Single-molecule measurements can reveal hidden details \u2013 especially transient dynamics and rarely populated states \u2013 and previous single-molecule studies of TPP and other riboswitch aptamers using either optical trap or single-molecule FRET have already provided novel insights. Optical traps allow the application of mechanical forces to the ends of the aptamer and measure the forces at which unfolding and folding occur. Based on the extension change during such 'rips', the local structures that are being altered can be characterized and assigned. But because the optical trap alone reports only on the end-to-end distance of the aptamer, the internal degrees of freedom cannot be examined, at least not directly. In smFRET, different parts of the molecule can be labeled so that docking and undocking of part of the molecule that is important for the ligand-specific structural organization and is distant from the primary stem can be studied. By adding the smFRET capability to the optical trap setup, they are able to ask whether FRET changes can occur coincident or independent of major rips detected by optical trap."

A simultaneous observation of distinct FRET levels indicates that three conformers exist, corresponding to the apo state, a weakly bound form, and a tightly bound one. The use of TPP analogs lacking the terminal phosphate suggests that these ligands only support the weak-binding configuration and that the terminal phosphate is required to bring the two helix arms of the switch together."

It is also known that ATTO647N undergoes spectral fluctuations, giving rise to intensity fluctuations on its own, and this can give rise to apparent FRET changes. Extended FRET trajectories at zero force can reassure the readers if this is not a problem."

Specifically, the authors contrast their findings on a eukaryotic RNA with the previous findings from a bacterial RNA. Unfortunately, their data do not reveal whether these differences are inherent to these divisions of life, or if these differences are just individual characteristics that might vary between any two riboswitches. The authors are well aware of this concern based on some of their comments in the Discussion section.

Well, if the difference is within error, that means the difference is not big enough to be considered significant. Then, why mention it at all? Second, because they acquired optical trap data simultaneously, they should analyze the mechanical data for the transition kinetics and make a direct comparison to rule out the possibility the aptamer modification and fluorescent labeling affect the kinetics even though they do not seem to affect the forces at which the major rips occur."

Reading back the 2012 Anthony et al. paper, I see where they are supposed to occur (for example, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> in the PNAS paper), but in the current manuscript these observations are poorly detailed. Also confusing is that the assignment of the 'rips' is different in the current manuscript than those in the PNAS paper: the authors attribute the transitions to the structural elements P1, (P2+P4/P5), and P3, while in the PNAS manuscript, these transitions are interpreted as corresponding to the elements (P1+P2), P4/P5, and P3."

It must be the case because they do not see such FRET increases during the refolding phase when the force was kept low (~2.5 pN). But I do not understand why higher forces applied would induce L5 and P3 to approach each other. If this can be shown to be the case, I think that is quite surprising and significant. Or perhaps the ligand simply does not bind at 2.5 pN? What happens if they keep the force near zero for an extended period? Would they not see such FRET increases?"

This is something of an apples\u2010and\u2010oranges comparison, in truth: the RNA sequences of these riboswitches differ in significant ways, and we never anticipated that our results would be similar. And indeed, <i>they were not</i>. We cited the previous Haller, et al. (2013) findings primarily to point out how different that behavior was from what we observed. Our study was never intended to replicate aspects of the Blanchard group experiments. We employed an entirely different methodology, we investigated a different biological system, and we addressed some very different questions using force spectroscopy. We do not believe that we should be required to replicate the Blanchard experiments using their chosen methodology. Doing so is not feasible (see the reason below), and is very clearly outside the scope of the present study. Regardless of what one might, or might not, learn by so doing, it would not change any of the findings reported in our manuscript, which relate to the eukaryotic form of the riboswitch. The scholarly thing to do is to compare our findings with this other system in the Discussion, and to cite the relevant work, just as we do. We should not be asked to replicate their experiments using their methods. This is akin to asking a crystallographer to acquire an NMR structure, as well."

Fortunately, we can answer it without replicating the Blanchard experiments, and we believe that this should satisfy the concern raised. (N.B: The reviewers\u2019 term \u201czero force\u201d is something of a misnomer, however, because RNA that folds in buffer under zero externalload is by no means subjected to \u201czero force:\u201d internally, there are some very significant thermal forces, viscous forces, electrostatic forces, and entropic forces to contend with.) The Haller et al. (2013) work was performed without applying external loads. The aptamer dynamics that we observe in our apparatus under the very lowest applied loads, i.e., performed under negligible external forces, are essentially equivalent: these data are not anticipated to differ in any significant way from the results of a TIRF\u2010based, smFRET study. Specifically, whenever we allow our RNA constructs to refold, we place the molecules under negligible loads (in practice, such forces are all below 5 pN)."

These established results imply that any dynamics observed during the refolding process (under &lt;5 pN) should be comparable to the dynamics one would observe at further\u2010reduced force, down to 0 pN. Put another way, there is no evidence that riboswitch folding changes under the lowest applied loads, between 0\u20105 p pN, because RNA secondary structure forms freely within this range. (Incidentally, this makes perfect sense from an energetic perspective, because a 2\u00c5 displacement under 5 pN only supplies 1 pN\u2219nm, which is less than \u00bckT!)"

During the refolding period (0.5 s or 1.0 s), the denatured aptamer is maintained at a negligible load and allowed to refold. The data show that in the absence of TPP, the aptamer adopts the fully\u2010folded, non\u2010binding (apo) configuration. This same conformation is stable throughout the subsequent force ramp, right up until the point of the first rip. With the eukaryotic aptamer is in this state, rapid \u201cflickering\u201d transitions into and out of additional FRET states, similar to those reported by Haller, et al., for the bacterial form of the aptamer, <i>were not observed</i>. (As we discussed in the original manuscript, our imaging time resolution is slightly lower than that of the Blanchard group, but it\u2019s more than sufficient to have seen comparable fluctuations among states, had these been present.) We draw this comparison not to refute the results of the Haller, et al. (2013) study, but merely to highlight the divergent behaviors between the eukaryotic and bacterial TPP riboswitches."

Beyond that, it is non\u2010trivial to conduct the necessary instrument calibrations and data analysis. As a practical matter, our Force\u2010FRET apparatus, which employs confocal illumination, cannot be used to conduct TIRF\u2010based smFRET without re\u2010building its illumination optics altogether, which would render it useless for much of its present work! A different suite of support programs for acquiring and processing images would also have to be written. Even if we were to seek collaboration with some other lab to use their smTIRF apparatus (which we should not be required to do!), the RNA constructs that we developed for use in our optical\u2010 trapping dumbbell assays are unsuitable for tethering directly to surfaces in smTIRF assays. An entirely different set of molecular constructs would have to synthesized, with different handle lengths and different chemical linkers, suitable for surface\u2010tethering. Finally, these new constructs would all have to chemically labeled with fluorophores in the lab, assayed for chemical yield, and subsequently tested. Appropriate experimental controls (both positive and negative) would have to be run. This enterprise represents an entire one\u2010 to two\u2010year project! Fortunately, it is also completely unnecessary, because we are able to answer the question posed about what happens at negligible forces using data we\u2019ve already acquired in our Force\u2010FRET study, rendering this possibility moot."
