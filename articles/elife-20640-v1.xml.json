Here we dissect at the cytological, functional and structural level a conserved polarization module from the free living \u03b1-proteobacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> and an orthologous system from an obligate intracellular (rickettsial) pathogen. The NMR solution structure of the zinc-finger (ZnR) domain from the bifunctional and bipolar ZitP pilus assembly/motility regulator revealed conserved interaction determinants for PopZ, a bipolar matrix protein that anchors the ParB centromere-binding protein and other regulatory factors at the poles. We show that ZitP regulates cytokinesis and the localization of ParB and PopZ, targeting PopZ independently of the previously known binding sites for its client proteins. Through heterologous localization assays with rickettsial ZitP and PopZ orthologs, we document the shared ancestries, activities and structural determinants of a (bi-)polarization system encoded in free-living and obligate intracellular \u03b1-proteobacteria."

Here we dissect at the cytological, functional and structural level a conserved polarization module from the free living \u03b1-proteobacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> and an orthologous system from an obligate intracellular (rickettsial) pathogen. The NMR solution structure of the zinc-finger (ZnR) domain from the bifunctional and bipolar ZitP pilus assembly/motility regulator revealed conserved interaction determinants for PopZ, a bipolar matrix protein that anchors the ParB centromere-binding protein and other regulatory factors at the poles. We show that ZitP regulates cytokinesis and the localization of ParB and PopZ, targeting PopZ independently of the previously known binding sites for its client proteins. Through heterologous localization assays with rickettsial ZitP and PopZ orthologs, we document the shared ancestries, activities and structural determinants of a (bi-)polarization system encoded in free-living and obligate intracellular \u03b1-proteobacteria."

                        "text": "The fresh-water bacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> is a model system for the genetic analysis of \u03b1-proteobacterial cell polarity because polar differentiation is tightly coordinated with cell cycle progression and because of the availability of a myriad of genetic tools to study this species compared to the obligate intracellular (rickettsial) pathogens (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)(<a href=\"#bib13\">Curtis and Brun, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ely, 1991</a>). The <i>C. crescentus</i> predivisional cell features the flagellum and a pilus biosynthesis machine at the new pole and a stalk, a cylindrical extension of the cell envelope, at the old pole. Upon completion of cell division, the replicative stalked (ST) cell progeny begins chromosome replication and an asymmetric cell division cycle. By contrast, the motile and piliated swarmer (SW) cell progeny resides temporarily in a non-replicative (G1-like) state. At the SW to ST cell transition, the flagellated and piliated (SW) pole is remodeled into a ST pole and the developing cell acquires DNA replication competence. Replication of the circular chromosome proceeds bi-directionally from the single origin of replication (<i>Cori</i>) located at the nascent ST pole (<a href=\"#bib13\">Curtis and Brun, 2010</a>). Once duplicated, the <i>Cori</i> region is rapidly segregated towards the nascent SW pole by the ParAB chromosome segregation system that targets the <i>parS</i> centromeric sequence located <i>circa</i> 8 kbp from <i>Cori</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)(<a href=\"#bib44\">Mohl and Gober, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Viollier et al., 2004</a>). The <i>cis</i>-encoded ParB protein binds <i>parS</i> and the resulting ParB\u2022<i>parS</i> complex is guided pole-ward by the ParA ATPase, likely reinforced by poorly understood biophysical constraints and properties of the chromosome (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lim et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mohl and Gober, 1997</a>). The PopZ polar organizing protein is thought to assemble a porous homo-polymeric matrix at the cell poles that captures the segregated ParB\u2022<i>parS</i> complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) via a direct interaction with ParAB (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bowman et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ebersbach et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Holmes et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Laloux and Jacobs-Wagner, 2013</a>)."

The 20 NMR structures of ZitP<sup>(1-43)</sup> were overlaid with a root mean square deviation of 0.23 \u00c5 over the backbone atoms (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), revealing two double-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheets (\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2), forming a \u2018crab claw\u2019 in which C5, C8, C28, C31 are located at the turns of \u03b21/\u03b22 and \u03b23/\u03b24 chelate a zinc ion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>).

This turned our attention to the aromatic side-chain of an invariant tryptophan at position 35 (W35, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) that stacks above the zinc-coordination module of ZitP and that is replaced by a new species upon the addition of PopZ. W35 is interesting because the aromatic side chain at this position is replaced by an isoleucine in the primary structure of the AgmX zinc-finger (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) that does not localize in <i>C. crescentus</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Moreover, W35 is surrounded by a surface-exposed patch of basic residues (K18, R24, R27, R34, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) and it is required to bind PopZ in vitro, as determined by ITC with a W35I mutant derivative of ZitP<sup>(1-43)</sup> [ZitP<sup>(1-43)W35I</sup>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>]. Consistent with these ITC experiments, W35I impairs the interaction of Dendra2-ZitP<sup>(1-43)</sup> with polar PopZ in vivo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>), as indicated by the diffuse fluorescence of Dendra2-ZitP<sup>(1-43)</sup> in <i>C. crescentus</i> and in <i>E. coli</i> cells expressing PopZ (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>). Similarly, a C5S/C8S/C28S/C31S quadruple or a R24A/R27A double mutation both disrupt polarization of Dendra2-ZitP<sup>(1-43)</sup> in <i>C. crescentus</i> and in PopZ-expressing <i>E. coli</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>). As all of the substituted Dendra2-ZitP<sup>(1-43)</sup> variants are stably expressed (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), we conclude that these residues are required for the formation of a polar ZitP<sup>(1-43)</sup>\u2022PopZ complex."

The C-terminal DUF3426 that is required for polar pilus biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mignolet et al., 2016</a>) is not required to improve growth\u00a0, as revealed by growth measurements of\u00a0cells expressing the ZitP<sup>(1-133)</sup> variant.

We found that localization of ParB and PopZ is strongly perturbed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) upon induction of ZitP<sup>(1-133)</sup> with xylose. Time lapse-fluorescence imaging revealed that the pole-ward movement of CFP-ParB normally seen in S-phase of <i>WT</i> cells stalls halfway through in cells overexpressing ZitP<sup>(1-133)</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, see <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a> for GFP-ParB). In these cells, mCherry-PopZ forms internal clusters, often proximal to CFP-ParB clusters. By contrast, CFP-ParB movement and mCherry-PopZ localization proceeds normally through the cell cycle in cells overexpressing the W35I derivative of ZitP<sup>(1-133)</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Also, ZitP<sup>(1-133)</sup> overexpression displaces a monomeric ParA derivative [ParA(G16V)] whose localization is PopZ-dependent (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ptacin et al., 2014</a>) from the cell poles into aberrant cytoplasmic clusters (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). These defects seen at the single cell level are accompanied by cell filamentation at the population level and are not apparent either with full-length ZitP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) overexpressed to comparable levels (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>) or with ZitP<sup>(1-133)</sup> variants harboring the W35I single mutation, the R24A/R27A double mutation or the C5S/C8S/C28S/C31S quadruple mutation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). As overexpression of the ZnR without any membrane anchoring domain [ZitP<sup>(1-90)</sup>] does not cause such cell cycle defects either (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), we asked if membrane-anchoring is specific for this ZitP activity. The aforementioned overexpression phenotypes are still supported by overexpression of a ZitP version in which the TM of ZitP<sup>(1-133)</sup> had been replaced with an unrelated TM from the <i>E. coli</i> MalF protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Finally, we also observed that\u00a0overproduction of ZitP<sup>1-133</sup> in <i>mCherry</i>-<i>popZ<sup>KEP</sup></i> cells [in which the interaction with ParAB is impaired, (<a href=\"#bib35\">Laloux and Jacobs-Wagner, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ptacin et al., 2014</a>) recapitulates the overxpression\u00a0phenotype (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>) seen in <i>mCherry</i>-<i>popZ</i> cells. Taken together, these results show that ZitP is able to redirect PopZ localization via a direct interaction at the membrane independently of the known interaction sites for ParA and ParB (and/or potentially other PopZ client proteins). As a consequence of PopZ delocalization, the localization of DNA segregation proteins like ParB and ParA is perturbed and cells divide infrequently owing to the tight coupling of chromosome segregation and cytokinetic control (<a href=\"#bib55\">Thanbichler and Shapiro, 2006</a>). Since <i>mCherry</i>-<i>popZ<sup>KEP</sup></i> cells are also affected by ZitP<sup>1-133</sup> in growth and division, an\u00a0unknown PopZ client protein(s) may contribute to the PopZ-dependent phenotypes caused by under- or over-expression of ZitP<sup>1-133</sup>."

When ZitP<sup>(1-43)</sup> is co-expressed with mCherry-PopZ in this system, mCherry-PopZ forms a single cluster (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) resembling the ones previously described (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bowman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ebersbach et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Laloux and Jacobs-Wagner, 2013</a>) whose location is fairly sporadic and infrequently associated with the cell extremity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). By contrast, co-expression of full-length ZitP or ZitP<sup>(1-133)</sup> directs mCherry-PopZ into a robust bipolar disposition in <i>E. coli</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Conversely, the localization of Dendra2-ZitP in <i>E. coli</i> co-expressing PopZ provided matching results: Dendra2-ZitP<sup>(1-133)</sup> and full length Dendra2-ZitP are both bipolar, whereas Dendra2-ZitP<sup>(1-133)W35I</sup> is dispersed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To confirm that Dendra2-ZitP associates with the polar membrane in <i>E. coli</i> rather than inclusion bodies, we localized it by super-resolution photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM)(<a href=\"#bib3\">Betzig et al., 2006</a>) and observed the fluorescent signals to line exclusively the polar caps (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). By contrast, Dendra2-ZitP is dispersed along the cell envelope when PopZ is absent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, these interdependent clusters of PopZ and ZitP at the polar caps are clearly distinct from the internal (cytoplasmic) aggregates typically seen for PopZ when expressed without ZitP in <i>E. coli</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) or in division-inhibited (filamentous) <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Laloux and Jacobs-Wagner, 2013</a>) and that resemble fluorescent aggregates of inclusion bodies (<a href=\"#bib43\">Miller et al., 2015</a>)."

By contrast, Dendra2-ZitP<sup>(1-43)</sup> is unable to do so, yet it still co-localizes (interacts) with mCherry-PopZ<sup>\u039426</sup>.

An obligate intracellular rickettsial (rod with bipolar PopZ) cell is depicted within a vacuole (dashed structure) of a host cell (closed structure) and presumed also to polarize PopZ\u2022ZitP (grey arrow). As ZitP is not present in the Rhizobiales, another mechanism of PopZ control is likely operational to drive it into a monopolar disposition.

This ZnR interacts directly with PopZ and controls its localization from the membrane, even when PopZ no longer carries the interaction sites for ParAB, indicating that PopZ localization is regulated by redundant mechanisms in <i>C. crescentus.</i> One mechanism may require ParAB or at least it depends on the N-terminal region of PopZ that promotes the interaction with ParAB and other PopZ client proteins (<a href=\"#bib26\">Holmes et al., 2016</a>). However, ZitP controls PopZ independently of this region, underscoring the multivalent interactions and multifunctional properties of PopZ."

While the DUF3426 is less conserved among the \u03b1-proteobacteria and dispensable for PopZ localization control, the membrane-anchored ZitP ZnR and PopZ binding is featured by many ZitP orthologs from the branch of obligate intracellular \u03b1-proteobacteria (the Rickettsiae) and regulates PopZ subcellular positioning."

However, the\u00a0ZitP ZnR lacks a fifth \u03b2-strand (\u03b25) that is used by Cren7 to establish critical sequence-specific contacts with DNA. An unexpected finding was that PopZ-bound ZitP associates indirectly with sites flanking the ParB-bound centromere (<i>parS</i>), rather than <i>parS</i> itself that ParB binds (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We found that the interaction between PopZ and ParAB (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bowman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ebersbach et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Laloux and Jacobs-Wagner, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ptacin et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2010</a>), or at least the N-terminal region of PopZ, is required for ZitP to associate with these <i>parS</i>-flanking sites. It is also possible that another (unknown) component(s) of the PopZ complex influences the association of ZitP at these sites or that it underlies an unprecedented mode of occupancy of the macromolecular ZitP\u2022PopZ\u2022ParB complex on the chromosome in proximity to <i>parS</i>. Interestingly, the ParB-centromeric complex was recently proposed to self-assemble via nucleation and \u2018caging\u2019 in vivo, i.e. three-dimensional stochastic interactions between ParB and <i>parS,</i> and possibly reinforced or delimited by adjacent nucleoprotein complexes (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sanchez et al., 2015</a>) or accessory factors that may allow super-complexes to extend into neighboring chromosomal regions."

The ParB-control function of PopZ\u2022ZitP depends on the ability of membrane-anchored ZitP ZnR to interact with PopZ. Our molecular dissections provide evidence that ZitP targets residues flanking the conserved C-terminal DUF2497 of PopZ.

The \u03b1-proteobacterial PopZ system is of distinct ancestry and structural features compared to DivIVA, and it aggregates into (sporadic) monopolar and non-polar (cytoplasmic) clusters in (filamentous) <i>E. coli</i> in the absence of ZitP. While these PopZ clusters do not rely on membrane curvature to find the <i>E. coli</i> poles, their localization mechanism is not understood (<a href=\"#bib35\">Laloux and Jacobs-Wagner, 2013</a>) and could reflect aggregation in a partially folded form into cellular inclusion bodies (<a href=\"#bib43\">Miller et al., 2015</a>). A clearly different mechanism underlies the robust assembly of (near native) bipolar PopZ\u2022ZitP complexes at the polar membrane as observed by PALM. It is possible that these PopZ\u2022ZitP complexes scout the poles by a similar mechanism as DivIVA, a possibility that warrants further investigation. As these bipolar PopZ\u2022ZitP complexes in <i>E. coli</i> can also be reconstituted with components from different \u03b1-proteobacteria, it is unlikely that it is mediated by specialized phospholipids as the composition differs between <i>E. coli</i>, <i>Caulobacterales</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">De Siervo, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">De Siervo and Homola, 1980</a>) and other \u03b1-proteobacteria, for example the Rickettsiales."

It suggests that these obligate intracellular pathogens also feature a polarized PopZ\u2022ZitP complex. The rickettsial actin filament organizer Sca2 is polarized and promotes actin-mediated motility of some <i>Rickettsiae</i> inside the host cell cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib23\">Haglund et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Madasu et al., 2013</a>). It is therefore conceivable that the PopZ\u2022ZitP bipolarity system served as a primordial platform (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>) for the acquisition of specialized polarity based functions conferred via PopZ-interacting proteins that reinforce bipolarity and/or confer other polarized traits. For example, PopZ is also required for stalk biogenesis in <i>C. crescentus</i> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bowman et al., 2010</a>), a structure that requires specialized peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis enzymes (<a href=\"#bib33\">K\u00fchn et al., 2010</a>). As several Rhizobiales members also sequester PopZ to the site of PG synthesis to promote unipolar growth (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson-Furgeson et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brown et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Curtis and Brun, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Grangeon et al., 2015</a>), the current challenge is to determine which proteins interact with PopZ in the different \u03b1-proteobacterial branches, particularly in the Rhizobiales. PopZ is unipolar in this branch (<a href=\"#bib18\">Deghelt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Grangeon et al., 2015</a>) and no ZitP orthologs are encoded, suggesting that unknown PopZ-control mechanisms exist (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>,<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). By contrast, many members of the Rhodobacterales, do not encode a conspicuous PopZ ortholog in their genome. This, along with the structural divergence of the ZitP<sup>ZnR</sup> in this lineage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), suggests that ZitP has been appropriated for other functions or interactions with partners differing in primary structure."

Similar selective forces must have ensured the evolution and retention of related polarity control modules in free-living and obligate intracellular bacteria since misregulation of polarity similarly perturbs the \u03b1-proteobacterial cell division cycle."

However, the authors also strive to prove the reverse \u2013 that ZitP directs PopZ localization. They succeed in showing this under two circumstances \u2013 co-expression of proteins in <i>E. coli</i> and in the context of overproduction of ZitP<sup>1-133</sup> in Caulobacter. At times, the authors seem to be drawing too strong of a conclusion from these results, as the same might be expected of any protein that binds to PopZ. Thus, ZitP's role in directing PopZ may not be unique, especially if PopZ has many binding partners. The possibility of many binding partners may be inferred from the fact that nearly all ST proteins (in addition to the chromosome centromere and ParA/B are delocalized in a <i>popZ</i> knockout background (Bowman et al. 2010). To support the claim that ZitP has a physiological role in directing PopZ localization, they also show that zitP knockouts enhance the cell division phenotype in PopZ mutant backgrounds where PopZ cannot interact with ParA/B. This is a critical result that bears further exploration. First, the authors should determine whether interaction with PopZ is needed for rescue by testing the effects of rescuing the PopZ<sup>KE/KEP</sup> mutant with the W35I mutant of ZitP. Additionally, the authors should ask which parts of ZitP are critical for the rescuing effect by adding back different sections of ZitP into the PopZ<sup>KE</sup> and/or KEP background. If ZitP<sup>1-133</sup>is sufficient to rescue the phenotype and ZitP<sup>1-43</sup> is not, this suggests that membrane anchoring and not just interaction with PopZ is important for proper polar localization of PopZ. If full length ZitP is required, it suggests an important functional role for the C-terminal domain. If ZitP<sup>1-43</sup> is sufficient, the model that ZitP directs PopZ localization will likely require some adjustment."

Thus, interaction between ZitP and DNA may not be direct or even indirect in the formal sense. It is likely that indirect binding to DNA was observed for PopZ, as sequence-dependent association with DNA probably occurs through ParB/ParA. However, we also know that centromeres reside near poles in Caulobacter cells, and that the poles also have PopZ. Thus, some of the binding observed by ChIP-seq may have occurred merely because PopZ and the centromere are in proximity \u2013 not from a direct or even an indirect connection between protein and DNA. Similarly, it seems possible that ZitP is merely in the vicinity of centromere by virtue of its interaction with PopZ, and not indirectly binding to DNA. The conclusions would be strengthened if the authors could provide more compelling evidence that ZitP isn't interacting with sites near centromeric DNA because it is at the poles and happens to be near DNA that is not otherwise occluded by ParA/ParB/PopZ. If this is not possible, several of the authors' conclusions should be reworded, the issue should be raised in the main text of the manuscript, and mechanisms outside of ZitP-DNA interactions should be discussed."

Additionally, we decided not to push hard to find a solution because it seemed unlikely that a difference would be visible even if the technical problems could be resolved. While it is certainly plausible that ZitP acts as membrane anchor for PopZ, it clearly does act as sole membrane anchor since there are other transmembrane proteins such as DivL and CckA as reported by the Bowman group that interact with PopZ directly and would likely mask the contribution (i.e. membrane association) by ZitP."

However, the authors also strive to prove the reverse \u2013 that ZitP directs PopZ localization. They succeed in showing this under two circumstances \u2013 co-expression of proteins in E. coli and in the context of overproduction of ZitP<sup>1-133</sup> in Caulobacter. At times, the authors seem to be drawing too strong of a conclusion from these results, as the same might be expected of any protein that binds to PopZ. Thus, ZitP's role in directing PopZ may not be unique, especially if PopZ has many binding partners. The possibility of many binding partners may be inferred from the fact that nearly all ST proteins (in addition to the chromosome centromere and ParA/B are delocalized in a popZ knockout background (Bowman et al. 2010). To support the claim that ZitP has a physiological role in directing PopZ localization, they also show that zitP knockouts enhance the cell division phenotype in PopZ mutant backgrounds where PopZ cannot interact with ParA/B. This is a critical result that bears further exploration. First, the authors should determine whether interaction with PopZ is needed for rescue by testing the effects of rescuing the PopZ KE / KEP mutant with the W35I mutant of ZitP. Additionally, the authors should ask which parts of ZitP are critical for the rescuing effect by adding back different sections of ZitP into the PopZ KE and/or KEP background. If ZitP</i><sup><i>1-133</i></sup> <i>is sufficient to rescue the phenotype and ZitP</i><sup><i>1-43</i></sup> <i>is not, this suggests that membrane anchoring and not just interaction with PopZ is important for proper polar localization of PopZ. If full length ZitP is required, it suggests an important functional role for the C-terminal domain. If ZitP</i><sup><i>1-43</i></sup> <i>is sufficient, the model that ZitP directs PopZ localization will likely require some adjustment.</i> "

Thus, interaction between ZitP and DNA may not be direct or even indirect in the formal sense. It is likely that indirect binding to DNA was observed for PopZ, as sequence-dependent association with DNA probably occurs through ParB/ParA. However, we also know that centromeres reside near poles in Caulobacter cells, and that the poles also have PopZ. Thus, some of the binding observed by ChIP-seq may have occurred merely because PopZ and the centromere are in proximity \u2013 not from a direct or even an indirect connection between protein and DNA. Similarly, it seems possible that ZitP is merely in the vicinity of centromere by virtue of its interaction with PopZ, and not indirectly binding to DNA. The conclusions would be strengthened if the authors could provide more compelling evidence that ZitP isn't interacting with sites near centromeric DNA because it is at the poles and happens to be near DNA that is not otherwise occluded by ParA/ParB/PopZ. If this is not possible, several of the authors' conclusions should be reworded, the issue should be raised in the main text of the manuscript, and mechanisms outside of ZitP-DNA interactions should be discussed.</i>"

Moreover, the interaction of PopZ with ParA/B (or other DNA binding proteins that might associate with PopZ N-terminal region) is clearly critical as well. However, because the binding is distinct from that of ParB it is possible that this mediated via ParAB binding to adjacent sites or by another (unknown) protein in the PopZ complex. The ChIP-seq results are de-emphasized in the modified Results section, but briefly mentioned in the revised Discussion."
