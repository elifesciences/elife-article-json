In contrast, reduplicating chromosomes without separation frequently produces polytene chromosomes, a barrier to accurate mitosis. Chromosome reduplication occurs in many contexts, including: polytene tissue development, polytene tumors, and following treatment with mitosis-blocking chemotherapeutics. However, mechanisms responding to or resolving polyteny during mitosis are poorly understood. Here, using <i>Drosophila,</i> we uncover two distinct reduplicated chromosome responses. First, when reduplicated polytene chromosomes persist into metaphase, an anaphase delay prevents tissue malformation and apoptosis. Second, reduplicated polytene chromosomes can also separate prior to metaphase through a spindle-independent mechanism termed Separation-Into-Recent-Sisters (SIRS). Both reduplication responses require the spindle assembly checkpoint protein Mad2. While Mad2 delays anaphase separation of metaphase polytene chromosomes, Mad2\u2019s control of overall mitotic timing ensures efficient SIRS. Our results pinpoint mechanisms enabling continued proliferation after genome reduplication, a finding with implications for cancer progression and prevention."

During mitosis, chromatids associate in sister pairs, which facilitates their bi-orientation and subsequent segregation to opposite spindle poles. A frequently occurring and long-recognized departure from this paired chromosome structure occurs when the genome reduplicates without chromatid separation (hereafter: genome reduplication). Following a single extra S-phase, cells frequently form diplochromosomes: four sister chromatids conjoined at centromeres (<a href=\"#bib70\">White, 1935</a>). A more general term for chromosomes formed by any degree of genome reduplication without chromatid separation is 'polytene' (<a href=\"#bib46\">Painter, 1934</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zhimulev et al., 2004</a>)."

In addition to connections between sister chromatids, another layer of chromosome association - pairing between homologs - also occurs in some polytene cells. This pairing results in polyploid/polytene cells that exhibit only the haploid number of distinct chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Metz, 1916</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">White, 1954</a>). Given these multiple physical connections between polytene chromatids, mitosis in polytene cells is considered 'ill-advised for mechanical reasons' (<a href=\"#bib15\">Edgar and Orr-Weaver, 2001</a>). Indeed, separation of polytene diplochromosomes at anaphase causes chromosome mis-segregation (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vidwans et al., 2002</a>)."

Programmed genome reduplication cycles of successive S-phase without M-phase (endocycles, <a href=\"#bib16\">Edgar et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fox and Duronio, 2013</a> see nomenclature) produce polytene chromosomes in many plant, insect, and mammalian species, including humans (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zhimulev et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zybina et al., 1996</a>). However, many cells with programmed genome reduplication do not subsequently divide, preventing study of how nature has circumvented the issue of segregating polytene chromosomes. In contrast, we previously demonstrated that rectal papilla (hereafter: papillar cells), ion-absorbing structures in the <i>Drosophila</i> hindgut, are built entirely by mitosis of endocycled cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fox et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Schoenfelder et al., 2014</a>). Surprisingly, we never observed polytene chromosomes in hundreds of papillar metaphases (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fox et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Schoenfelder et al., 2014</a>), suggesting papillar cells are programmed to either avoid or eliminate polyteny and its associated mitotic defects. Interestingly, previous studies suggest that polyteny can be at least partially undone without anaphase in both normal and tumorous tissue (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dej and Spradling, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Grell, 1946</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Levan and Hauschka, 1953</a>).

However, the responses that enable either developing or tumorous cells to continue dividing after reduplication, despite profound chromosome structure changes, remain unclear. Here, using <i>Drosophila</i> tissue models of both ectopic and naturally occurring genome reduplication, we uncover two distinct cellular responses to reduplicated chromosomes. Both reduplication responses require the conserved spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) protein Mad2, which inhibits the Anaphase Promoting Complex to both delay anaphase in response to unattached or tensionless kinetochores and to also regulate overall mitotic timing from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) to anaphase onset (<a href=\"#bib36\">London and Biggins, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Musacchio, 2015</a>). In reduplicated cells that retain polytene chromosomes at metaphase, we show Mad2 is involved in a SAC wait-anaphase response. This anaphase delay does not fully prevent the mitotic errors and the resulting aneuploidy associated with mitosis of polytene chromosomes, but it substantially reduces apoptosis, tissue malformation, and organismal death. In contrast to this wait-anaphase response, we also define a second response in reduplicated cells that actively eliminates polyteny before anaphase. In this response, polytene chromosomes undergo a dynamic, spindle-independent process we term <span class=\"underline\">S</span>eparation <span class=\"underline\">I</span>nto <span class=\"underline\">R</span>ecent <span class=\"underline\">S</span>ister chromatid pairs (SIRS), which eliminates any trace of polyteny before anaphase. Unlike mitosis with metaphase polytene chromosomes, mitosis with SIRS does not trigger a Mad2-dependent anaphase delay. Yet, we find Mad2 promotes efficient SIRS by allowing sufficient time between nuclear envelope breakdown and anaphase, which allows polytene chromosomes to separate into conventional mitotic sister chromatid pairs. Our results therefore define two distinct responses to reduplicated chromosomes, each of which depends on a distinct Mad2 response."

Thus, the long-term effects of ectopic genome reduplication on cell viability and tissue development, and key molecular regulation of reduplicated chromosomes has remained unexplored.

Using the cell cycle marker system Fly-FUCCI (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zielke et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) we find that pulsed <i>fzr</i> overexpression temporarily eliminates expression of the S/G2/M mRFP-CyclinB reporter in wing imaginal disc cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C vs. C\u2019, D</a>). This same population of mRFP-CyclinB-negative cells continues to express the G2/M/G1 GFP-E2F1 reporter, but in greater proportion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C vs. C\u2019, D</a>).

To test whether this G1 accumulation is due to direct conversion of G2 cells to G1, as opposed to an acceleration of the cell cycle through G2/M, we stained for the mitotic marker Phospho-Histone H3 at several time points after pulsed <i>fzr</i> expression. For up to 7\u2009hr after <i>fzr</i> overexpression, there is essentially no mitosis in the wing imaginal disc, whereas wing cells in heat shocked wild type flies continue to divide after heat shock (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure\u00a01\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

At this time-point, we observe frequent tetraploidy (41% of mitotic cells, equivalent to 93% of all G2 cells prior to heat shock, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E v. F,F\u2019,H</a>). We obtained similar results when examining the results of <i>fzr</i> overexpression in diploid brain progenitors (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These results confirm our ability to induce genome reduplication in normally diploid tissues. We also examined chromosome structure in our induced tetraploid cells. When <i>HS&gt;fzr-</i>induced tetraploid DNA first condenses post-heat shock, all chromatids of each chromosome type are closely aligned in a polytene configuration, as evidenced by having the haploid number of distinguishable chromosomes (four in females, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Frequently, we observe un-pairing of the homologous groups of centromeres within each polytene chromosome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, asterisk, also see discussion). Later, at the first metaphase, homologous chromosomes of each polytene are now completely separated, but the four centromeres of each group of sister chromatids remain conjoined within diplochromosomes (observed for 96% of tetraploid cells, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>\u2019 inset, H). Thus, <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> induces ectopic genome reduplication, resulting in tetraploid cells with metaphase polytene diplochromosomes."

By examining the metaphase chromosomes of the division immediately following diplochromosome division, we could detect whether aneuploidy results from diplochromosome segregation. Following the division of cells with diplochromosomes, we observe tetraploid-aneuploid cells with one or two extra or missing chromosomes (8.6% of mitotic cells). In these cells, diplochromosomes are no longer present and instead chromatids are found in distinct sister pairs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). This suggests that during or after anaphase of the first post-reduplication division, diplochromosomes can separate into individual chromatids. Further, these diplochromosome divisions can produce aneuploid daughter cells, many of which continue to divide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H,K</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

In contrast, most (80%) tetraploid divisions with diplochromosomes exhibit lagging chromosomes, DNA bridges, or both (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a> HS+10\u2009hr, J, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). In our live imaging, diplochromosomes were identifiable as quartets of centromeres and their associated chromosome arms in very close proximity. In some of these divisions we clearly observe four chromatids of a diplochromosome quartet segregating 3:1 (in agreement with prior work in embryos by <a href=\"#bib68\">Vidwans et al., 2002</a>, suggesting incomplete or imprecise sister chromatid disjunction is the cause of chromosome gains and losses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>).

In spite of the high initial error rate caused by separation of diplochromosomes, tetraploid-aneuploid cell divisions continue to occur for at least 5 days after genome reduplication, as determined by cytology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a> HS+120\u2009hr).

We thus examined the survival of these animals to adulthood. Survival is only subtly affected in animals with mild (23.0% tetraploid [S.E.M. 4.9%]) levels of induced error-prone tetraploid progenitor division (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and resulting adult tissues appear normal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast, when tetraploidy is further increased by increasing the duration of heat shock, organism survival decreases in a tetraploid-dependent fashion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Together, these results show that ectopic genome reduplication in multiple progenitor tissues yields tetraploid cells with polytene metaphase diplochromosomes, which are aneuploid-prone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). These conclusions are in agreement with a previous study in the terminal embryonic division of embryos (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vidwans et al., 2002</a>). We further show that such aneuploid-prone cells can continue to propagate, and that only at high frequencies are these error-prone tetraploid mitotic events lethal to the organism."

Little is known about aneuploidy prevention mechanisms in cells with polytene chromosomes, despite the numerous mechanisms that can generate these aberrations. Through live imaging, we uncovered one such aneuploidy-prevention mechanism in cells with metaphase diplochromosomes. Because our heat shock protocol only affects cells in G2, a single <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> pulse creates a mixed population of unaltered diploid cells and diplochromosome-containing tetraploid cells,\u00a0allowing us to simultaneously live image both cell types in the same tissue. Metaphase in cells with diplochromosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, yellow dotted outline) is significantly longer than in diploid cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> blue dashed outline, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), consistent with previous work on diplochromosomes formed in <i>Drosophila</i> Securin mutants (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pandey et al., 2005</a>). We thus hypothesized that diplochromosomes trigger the SAC, which activates a wait-anaphase signal until all kinetochores attach to microtubules and are under tension (<a href=\"#bib36\">London and Biggins, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Musacchio, 2015</a>). To test this model, we examined SAC-defective <i>mad2</i> null animals (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buffin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Emre et al., 2011</a>) <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Using live imaging of wing imaginal discs before and after heat shock, we find that loss of <i>mad2</i> eliminates the lengthened period of metaphase caused by diplochromosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). When the checkpoint is active unattached or misattached kinetochores generate a wait-anaphase signal by localizing SAC proteins such as BubR1 to those kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib42\">Musacchio, 2015</a>). To confirm that diplochromosomes have localized SAC proteins we co-imaged kinetochores and BubR1 in wing disc cells after <i>fzr</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib54\">Royou et al., 2010</a>). We find that in diploid cells BubR1-GFP is clearly evident on kinetochores following nuclear envelope break down and remains there until anaphase. This signal is relatively evenly spread across all the kinetochores (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, diploid, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). In contrast BubR1-GFP remains localized for much longer in cells with diplochromosomes and is often localized strongly to a specific kinetochore group rather than evenly distributed, suggesting that a subset of diplochromosomes may have trouble forming attachments that satisfy the checkpoint (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, diplochromosomes, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>) From these data, we conclude that diplochromosomes trigger a SAC wait-anaphase response."

In contrast, the Mad2-dependent wait-anaphase response is essential during development of <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> animals. Even at low levels of tetraploidy, which affect the survival of <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> animals only slightly, few <i>HS&gt;fzr, mad2</i> animals survive to adulthood (15.4%, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To understand why <i>HS&gt;fzr, mad2</i> animals have survival defects, we analyzed the surviving animals. In these animals, we find a variety of developmental defects in normally diploid tissues, including smaller eyes, ectopic wing veins, and melanotic abdominal masses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Increased apoptosis is associated with these tissue malformation phenotypes, as progenitor tissue from <i>HS&gt;fzr, mad2</i> animals have much higher rates of apoptotic cell death as shown by both TUNEL labeling (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>), and cleaved caspase staining (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). Further, 100% of <i>mad2</i> diplochromosome divisions exhibit lagging chromosomes, or DNA bridges (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>), compared with 80% of divisions in <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> cells. These data may suggest that diplochromosomes are likely susceptible to at least two classes of mitotic errors, one that can be corrected by the SAC, and one that cannot. It is also likely that the <i>mad2</i> diplochromosome divisions are qualitatively more erroneous than in WT, which may account for differences in survival and tissue phenotype between these genotypes. Taken together, our data identify an important role for the Mad2-dependent SAC in delaying anaphase in the presence of metaphase polytene diplochromosomes."

In earlier work we found <i>Drosophila</i> rectal papillar cells (hereafter: papillar cells) naturally undergo two <i>fzr-</i>dependent endocycles during the 2<sup>nd</sup> larval instar to generate octoploid cells and then divide, on average, two times during pupal development. An intervening S-phase accompanies these polyploid divisions, and cells at the papillar base undergo one additional S-phase after the final polyploid mitosis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fox et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Schoenfelder et al., 2014</a>). Thus, as with <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> induction in diploid tissues, papillar development naturally involves genome reduplication followed by mitosis. Our previous work established that papillar mitoses can be error prone, so the same problems with dissociating polytene chromosomes in <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> tissues could be responsible for a portion of these errors during papillar divisions. However, we previously did not see, in hundreds of observed cells, any instances of metaphases with persistent polyteny in papillar cells, suggesting that papillar cells somehow avoid mitosis of polytene chromosomes. Through careful re-examination of the first octoploid metaphase, we confirmed that papillar chromosomes in these octoploid cells are arranged in individual sister chromatid pairs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2019\u2019</a> inset, C). This suggested two possibilities: 1) papillar cells never form polytenes, or 2) papillar cells form polytenes, but somehow separate into recent sister pairs prior to the first metaphase."

Papillar cells re-enter mitosis from a G2-like state, as evidenced by expression of the G2/M regulator Cdc25/string just before the onset of pupal cell cycles (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fox et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). At time points early in the first mitosis, we indeed find that papillar chromosomes are polytene (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, Polytene). In these polytenes, we again see examples of cells where the centromeric regions are no longer tightly associated, as we did in our studies of <i>HS&gt;fzr</i>-induced polyteny. However, unlike in cells with induced polyteny, the centromeres in papillar polytene cells are able to not only separate into groups of homologs, but to further separate into individual sister chromatid pairs (asterisks in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> vs. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, also see discussion). In flies heterozygous for inversion-containing balancer chromosomes, papillar polytene structure is locally perturbed, likely due to the disruption of somatic homolog pairing (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). At this early mitotic time point, we also observe cells where polytenes are absent. Instead, in these cells, sister chromatid pairs and homologs of each chromosome type are separated but remain clumped closely together, as if the polytene chromosome recently separated into pairs containing only the most recent sister chromatids (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2019, D</a>, Clumped). Neither the polytene nor the clumped configurations remain during the second division (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), suggesting a specific chromosome structure is present early in the first division of papillar cells. Similarly, by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) we find examples of both closely associated (polytene) and dispersed (separated/non-polytene) signals during the period of the first papillar mitosis (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,C</a>\u2019). Thus, a key difference between the response to genome reduplication between papillar and <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> cells is the elimination of polyteny before anaphase in papillar cells."

To enrich for early mitotic and pre-mitotic chromosomes, we induced Premature Chromosome Compaction (PCC) in papillar cells at a time point just prior to the first mitosis (Methods). PCC causes interphase chromosomes to condense and makes it possible to visualize interphase chromosome structure by standard cytological methods (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Using this technique, we find that in pre-mitotic papillar tissue, clear polytene chromosomes are present in nearly every cell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> Pre 1<sup>st</sup> Div, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). If we instead enrich for cells in metaphase of the first mitosis by treating with the spindle poison colcemid, we find zero examples where chromosomes are still polytene. In these metaphase-enriched samples, all chromosomes are separated into recent-sister pairs, and even cells with clumped chromosomes are rare (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, 1<sup>st</sup> Div +colc). Thus, our pharmacological studies further suggest that essentially all genome-reduplicated papillar cells are programmed to completely eliminate polytene chromosomes as cells progress into the first metaphase."

Prior to the first papillar mitosis, the kinetochores from each homolog are closely associated into an average of 4.1 large foci, close to the haploid number of distinct chromosomes (4 for females and 5 for males due to X/Y un-pairing, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). As time progresses in the first division, it is possible to watch these large kinetochore foci disperse into many smaller foci prior to metaphase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, inset, <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). In contrast, prior to the second division kinetochores are already separated into many more foci (an average of 15.1 observably distinct foci per cell) before entry into mitosis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). During the second division, the number of resolvable foci remains essentially constant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>, <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). Additionally, the histone marker reveals that polytene chromosomes are visible when chromosomes first condense and can then be seen to disperse during the first but not the second division (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F v. 3G</a>, -18:00\u2009min). This result confirms the model that genome-reduplicated papillar cells eliminate polyteny during the first mitosis, then undergo an intervening S-phase before the next division (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We also confirmed that each clump of 4 or 5 pre-first division centromeres only contains a single chromosome type. To do so, we took advantage of the fact that dosage compensation in flies relies on upregulation of transcription on the male X chromosome via the Dosage Compensation Complex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Conrad and Akhtar, 2011</a>). By live imaging papillar cells expressing the DCC complex protein MSL3 tagged with GFP, which localizes only to the male X-chromosome (<a href=\"#bib61\">Strukov et al., 2011</a>), we find that indeed only a single Cenp-C-Tomato focus is MSL3-GFP positive prior to polytene dissociation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, <a href=\"#media11\">Video 11</a>).

Interestingly, classical descriptions of mitosis in this part of the <i>Culex</i> hindgut seem to suggest a polytene organization is present only early in the first polyploid mitosis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Grell, 1946</a>). In agreement with this observations, we find Phospho-Histone H3 positive polytene chromosomes during the period of the first polyploid mitosis (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>, <a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>). From our <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Culex</i> studies, we conclude that unlike cells that enter metaphase with polytene chromosomes, a separate mechanism, SIRS, can eliminate polyteny as cells enter metaphase."

Because <i>mad2</i> loss has no reported mitotic defects in <i>Drosophila</i> animals (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buffin et al., 2007</a>), we were surprised to find that first division <i>mad2</i> papillar cells exhibit a substantial increase in DNA bridges (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, <a href=\"#media13\">Video 13</a>, <a href=\"#media14\">Video 14</a>).

As for the wait-anaphase response, this mitotic timing role involves Mad2 inhibition of the Anaphase Promoting Complex. However, Mad2\u2019s control of overall mitotic timing is irrespective of SAC kinetochore attachment surveillance (<a href=\"#bib38\">Meraldi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rodriguez-Bravo et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, <i>Drosophila</i> Mad1 is reported to be dispensable for regulation of NEBD-to-anaphase timing (<a href=\"#bib17\">Emre et al., 2011</a>). Given the lack of <i>mad1</i> phenotypes with respect to the first papillar division, we thus hypothesized that SIRS enables papillar cells to bypass the SAC-mediated anaphase delay, and that Mad2 control of overall mitotic timing is important during SIRS. If so, one would predict cells undergoing SIRS to not trigger an anaphase delay, but to still depend on mitotic timing."

This treatment increases the mitotic index of wild type papillar cells, whereas the mitotic index of <i>mad2</i> null animals is unaffected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>) Thus, spindle defects trigger the SAC wait-anaphase response in papillar cells. We next asked if the SAC wait-anaphase responds to polytene chromosomes during SIRS. If so, the first divisions (polytenes present) should have a longer metaphase than the second division (polytenes absent). However we find that metaphase is not any longer in the first papillar division than in the second papillar division, while in contrast metaphase is almost twice as long in wing cells with diplochromosomes than in those that are polyploid but lack diplochromosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). We then tested if triggering the SAC wait-anaphase response can prevent or delay SIRS completion. We find SIRS occurs on schedule even in the presence of colcemid concentrations that are sufficient to eliminate a detectable spindle and inhibit anaphase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>, <a href=\"#media16\">Video 16</a>, <a href=\"#media17\">Video 17</a>). We conclude that: a) SIRS is not regulated by the SAC wait-anaphase response, and b) chromosome separation during SIRS does not require a mitotic spindle."

Using an NEBD marker, we first confirmed that Mad2 regulates NEBD-to-anaphase timing and that <i>mad2</i> cells spend significantly less time in mitosis than wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>, <a href=\"#media18\">Video 18</a>, <a href=\"#media19\">Video 19</a>). We also find that Nuclear Envelope Breakdown and the onset of SIRS are synchronous in wild type cells and that SIRS generally continues until up to the onset of anaphase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This suggests that the rapid mitosis in <i>mad2</i> cells might lead to a failure of complete SIRS, which could cause the resulting DNA bridges. In our live imaging, we saw evidence that a pre-SIRS group of homologs would often fail to completely disperse prior to anaphase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <i>mad2,</i> yellow arrowhead). To quantify this, we generated heat maps and line profiles of centromere signals at the metaphase plate. We performed this analysis just prior to the onset of mitosis in wild type cells, <i>mad2</i> cells that did not generate bridges, and <i>mad2</i> cells that did generate DNA bridges (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). From these measurements, we found that SIRS fails to complete before anaphase in <i>mad2</i> animals, leading to a high variance of centromere intensity signal across the metaphase plate (reflecting failure of centromere dissociation/SIRS completion). This high variance disrupts the bilateral symmetry of the metaphase plate in <i>mad2</i> cells that form DNA bridges (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>\u2019). Taken together, our data show mitotic fidelity after genome reduplication is improved by one of two Mad2-dependent functions: 1) in the presence of metaphase polytene chromosomes a Mad2-dependent wait-anaphase signal is generated, 2) the efficient elimination of polytenes as cells enter metaphase by SIRS requires a Mad2 (but SAC wait-anaphase-independent) NEBD-anaphase timer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

Here, we define two such responses- one that prevents malformation of tissues with polytene chromosomes that persist until anaphase onset, and another (SIRS) that eliminates polyteny before anaphase onset. Both polyteny responses require the conserved mitotic fidelity regulator Mad2, yet Mad2\u2019s role in each response is distinct (anaphase delay vs. control of overall mitotic timing). These findings identify new roles for <i>Drosophila</i> Mad2, for which few roles have been identified. Further, our findings illuminate a likely recurring role for Mad2 in response to genome reduplication."

What particular feature of diplochromosomes triggers the SAC wait-anaphase response is unclear. It seems likely that diplochromosome structure is at least partially incompatible with attachment to the spindle. For example, it may be that the outer kinetochores block spindle attachment to the inner kinetochores within a diplochromosome, or it could be that the spindle has trouble generating tension on four kinetochores simultaneously, both of which would trigger the SAC wait-anaphase response. Eventually, the spindle appears able to attach and bi-orient all kinetochores, but the resulting anaphase is frequently error prone- with lagging chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). This result fits with the known ability of cells with erroneous merotelic kinetochore attachments to satisfy the SAC and proceed to anaphase with lagging chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gregan et al., 2011</a>). Potentially, then, the AuroraB-mediated mechanism that can correct merotely is overwhelmed/inoperable in cells with reduplicated chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cimini et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Knowlton et al., 2006</a>). Despite the inability of the SAC to prevent all instances of mitotic errors in cells with polyteny, our data suggest that development of normally diploid tissues with an operable SAC is not noticeably altered by up to 23% \u00b1 4.9% of divisions being error prone tetraploid divisions. Given the conserved nature of SAC signaling, and the widespread occurrence of diplochromosomes in disease, it will be interesting to explore whether the SAC wait-anaphase response is a general mechanism used to enable the expansion of aneuploid cells formed by aberrant genome reduplication."

This process does not require the Mad2-dependent wait-anaphase response, but the efficient completion of SIRS before anaphase requires the Mad2-dependent mitotic timer. Little is known about distinct, checkpoint-independent regulation of the Mad2 timer. In the future, papillar cells may prove useful in further study of the timer, given the dependence of SIRS completion on this Mad2 function."

This raises the question of why papillar cells employ SIRS, if papillar aneuploidy is well tolerated (<a href=\"#bib57\">Schoenfelder et al., 2014</a>). Based on our study of <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> cells, which lack SIRS, we propose that SIRS is required to prevent extreme polytene chromosome mis-segregation events during papillar development, which could result in inviable nullisomic cells. Additionally, we have recently found that papillar cells actively prevent accumulation of micronuclei resulting from broken DNA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bretscher and Fox, 2016</a>). Thus, while mitotic genome-reduplicated cells such as papillar cells do tolerate some degree of aneuploidy, processes such as micronucleus prevention and SIRS may act to ensure a viable degree of mitotic fidelity."

While future work will determine what differentiates cells capable of SIRS from cells with polytenes that persist until anaphase, our data thus far has examined three layers of polytene chromosome organization that either are or are not eliminated during papillar and <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> mitosis, and has pinpointed one of these layers of polytene organization as distinct to cells undergoing SIRS."

                                "text": "The first layer of polytene organization is homolog-homolog pairing. Given that we observe the haploid number of chromosomes after both papillar (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and HS&gt;<i>fzr</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) endocycles, it is clear that homologous chromosomes associate within both types of polytene chromosomes by somatic homolog pairing (<a href=\"#bib39\">Metz, 1916</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Painter, 1934</a>). Both mitotic papillar and <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> polytenes exhibit un-paired homologs before dividing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2019\u2019</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2019</a>), and this process appears to initiate at centromeres (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, asterisks, most obvious for the acrocentric X chromosome). Thus, homolog-homolog dissociation is not unique to SIRS. The second layer of polytene organization is interaction between sister chromatid pairs. Importantly, the arrangement of chromatid pairs at metaphase differs between cells that do or do not undergo SIRS. In SIRS-capable (e.g. papillar) cells, only the product of the single most recent round of replication (recent sisters, see nomenclature) remain attached at metaphase whereas the products of previous rounds of replication are no longer attached. In contrast, in SIRS-incapable (e.g. <i>HS&gt;fzr)</i> cells, all sister chromatids remain attached. Thus, the separation into chromatid pairs appears to be the critical function of SIRS. Future work can test if this separation requires the Condensin II complex activity during SIRS, which was shown previously to enable partial polytene chromosome dissociation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hartl et al., 2008</a>). The third layer of organization within polytenes are contacts between recent sister chromatid arms. These are equally undone by metaphase in both papillar and HS&gt;<i>fzr</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2019\u2019</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2019</a>) so that, at metaphase, chromatids are only attached at the centromere. This process likely involves the prophase cohesin removal pathway (<a href=\"#bib37\">Losada et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sumara et al., 2002</a>). Taken together, we conclude the key difference between SIRS-capable (e.g. papillar) and SIRS-incapable (<i>e.g,</i> HS&gt;<i>fzr)</i> cells is the ability to separate into sister chromatid pairs before metaphase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

During the endocycle, papillar cells show no evidence of karyokinesis, which suggests these cells lack a mechanical method of separating chromosomes during the endocycle (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fox et al., 2010</a>). However, we speculate that during endocycles, periodic cohesin removal occurs at centromeres after each S-phase. Such cohesin removal would then allow each chromatid to both eliminate its cohesins between its sister from a previous S-phase and then establish cohesins with a new sister during the subsequent S-phase. While alterations in cohesins do not noticeably perturb interphase polytene structure (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cunningham et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pauli et al., 2008</a>), future work can determine if such endocycle-mediated cohesin regulation confers cells with polytene chromosomes with the ability to undergo SIRS during a later mitosis. Future work can also determine if cohesin regulation differs during endocycles of cells that are destined to later divide. We previously defined features of a distinct pre-mitotic variant of the endocycle, which include centriole retention and the completeness of DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fox et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Schoenfelder et al., 2014</a>). Here, we propose that cohesin regulation may be also be distinct during this endocycle variant, and is a key factor to promoting SIRS."

Our data suggest NEBD is coincident with SIRS onset, possibly by allowing chromosomes to access some cytoplasmic SIRS regulator, or to initiate SIRS by releasing chromosomes from the nuclear envelope. Regarding the role of the Mad2 timer, it will be interesting to ask if it somehow senses completedness of DNA replication, which may be a pre-requisite for SIRS initiation."

Inspired by classical reports (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berger, 1938</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Grell, 1946</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Holt, 1917</a>), we found polytene chromosomes are present before polyploid mitosis in <i>Culex,</i> but are later apparent as individual chromosomes during mitosis (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Based on our results, we also suggest that chromosome dispersal in polyploid <i>Drosophila</i> ovarian nurse cells represents an incomplete version of SIRS (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dej and Spradling, 1999</a>), especially given that these chromosomes can further separate if mitotic cyclins are experimentally elevated (<a href=\"#bib52\">Reed and Orr-Weaver, 1997</a>). In polyploid trophoblasts of some mammalian species, polytene chromosomes separate into numerous bundles of paired chromosomes at the polykaryocyte stage, and thus SIRS may also occur in mammals (<a href=\"#bib78\">Zybina et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Zybina et al., 2011</a>). Similarly, SIRS may eliminate polyteny in some polyploid tumors. One of the first descriptions of polyteny in tumors noted diplochromosomes 'fall apart' <span class=\"underline\">before</span> anaphase (<a href=\"#bib35\">Levan and Hauschka, 1953</a>). Whole genome duplication is common (~37%) in human tumors (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zack et al., 2013</a>). Given the transient nature of polytene chromosomes in mitotic tissues demonstrated here, we suggest future studies of whole genome duplication in cancer models should closely examine the initial mitosis after multiple S-phases to identify potential polytene chromosome origins of tumor aneuploidy. Finally, while our studies agree with the notion that multiple S-phases and polyploidy precede aneuploidy (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davoli and de Lange, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gordon et al., 2012</a>), they also underscore the need for aneuploidy-prevention responses including SIRS and the SAC for continued propagation of viable polyploid/aneuploid cells. Future studies can reveal additional SIRS regulation, and other critical genome instability controls in normal or tumorous cells following genome reduplication."

Anaphase was determined as the first frame with poleward movement of the kinetochores as evident by Cenp-C-Tomato. Time from NEBD to anaphase was determined as the point from half-maximal Azami signal to anaphase. To calculate kinetochore clustering we closely cropped around the cell of interest for all frames. We then used a thresholding approach to outline each centromere or group of centromeres and stored those as ROIs. We then used those ROIs to measure the average intensity of each centromere pixel and the total area of all the pixels. We reasoned that as centromeres disperse the total area they cover increases and there is a corresponding decrease in fluorescence intensity from each individual point, therefore we divided the average pixel intensity by the area and normalized that on a scale from 1 to 0. To measure symmetry of metaphase centromere alignment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,D\u2019</a>), we generated a line plot of each metaphase plate at the frame immediately prior to metaphase. We then generated aggregate plots of each genotype."

For chromosomes we use 'homolog' to distinguish maternally and paternally contributed chromosomes of the same chromosome type. All chromatids of the same homolog are considered 'sisters.' We use 'recent sister' to refer to two chromatids that are the product of the most recent S-phase. 'Polytene' refers to the chromosome state of any cell formed by genome reduplication that has not fully separated its chromosomes into recent sisters. In a polyploid/polytene cell with somatic homolog pairing, polytene cells exhibit the haploid number of distinguishable chromosomes, whereas in a cell without homolog pairing, this number doubles. 4 chromatids conjoined at centromeres are 'diplochromosomes'. Please note that, using metaphase spreads, the presence/absence of diplochromosomes as well as the number of individual chromatids can only be scored when chromosomes are significantly condensed as in mitosis or in the presence of Calyculin A. We use the term \u201cendocycle\u201d to refer to any cell cycle involving successive genome reduplication without any sign of M-phase. We note the use in the literature of terms such as 'endoreduplication', 're-replication', and 'endoreplication' to often refer to the same phenomenon."

Second, they examine rectal papilla cells that normally undergo mitosis after having reduplicated their genomes. This study represents a significant new contribution to the way we think about how chromosome organizational states (e.g. polytenes) are normally modified, while it also reveals a very important new checkpoint-independent function of the Mad2 gene.

This Mad2 checkpoint-independent mitotic timer function, it is proposed, promotes separation into recent sister chromatids (SIRS), and presumably disrupts other interactions, e.g. homolog pairing that tend to be strong and ubiquitous in diploid and endoreduplicating <i>Drosophila</i> cells."

Can the authors clarify this? This may be difficult to do since we don't know the actual nature of the physical interactions that form/maintain <i>Drosophila</i> polytenes (likely not cohesins) and how similar they are to analogous chromosome structures in non-<i>Drosophila</i> cells. Nevertheless, this might be important to emphasize since it may be challenging for a non-<i>Drosophila</i>, non-polytene-centric viewpoint to understand the relevance of this new and exciting Mad2 driven SIRS mechanism. Similarly, in the third paragraph of the Introduction, the description about \"endocycled cells\" and \"polyteny\" is somewhat unclear. First of all, it is unclear how one can distinguish polytene chromosomes from regular chromosomes (containing only single sister chromatid). For example, how one can surely tell 4N vs. 8N? Are diplochromosomes from 4N (N + N + N + N) easily distinguishable from 2N+2N+2N+2N from 8N chromosomes, which might look diplochromosomes but each containing double the amount of DNA?"

Diplochromosomes are certainly the most obvious by metaphase spread analysis, which is the technique that has been used for decades to examine these structures. However, we found that we can also observe diplochromosomes during anaphase in live imaging. We expand here on their distinct appearance in live imaging. In live imaging of anaphases of first division <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> cells, we observe chromatid quartets, which consist of four clear centromeres and associated chromosome arms in very close proximity. These quartets are often seen lagging behind other chromosomes at anaphase, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>. The appearance of quartets is exactly what one would expect if a diplochromosome were to be delayed in its segregation, as our results in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> suggest to be the case."

We have thus revised the text to make this point clearer. In summary, due to both protocol differences (fixed spreads vs. live imaging) and temporal differences (metaphase vs. anaphase), diplochromosomes are not morphologically identical to their appearance in metaphase spreads, but are clearly recognizable in live images of the first <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> division.

We have since examined whether centrosomes duplicate, and to what extent, in <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> cells after heat shock. Much like papillar cells, we find very few (7%) <i>HS&gt;fzr</i> cells contain extra centrosomes at the first division, as assayed by Gamma Tubulin antibody staining.

These breaks are frequently at the same place on adjacent chromatids in a sister pair, which could best be explained by a break that occurred prior to or during S-phase, which was then propagated to both halves of the most recent sister pair.

In the near future, we plan to undertake our own studies and to examine whether cohesins, if dynamic in papillar cells, are similarly dynamic in other polytene cells that do not undergo future divisions.

Although it is specified in the first paragraph of the Introduction that \"polytene\" refers to the persistence of chromatid associations, most readers will assume that especially in Drosophila \"polytene\" also refers to homolog-homolog pairing. Can the authors clarify this? This may be difficult to do since we don't know the actual nature of the physical interactions that form/maintain Drosophila polytenes (likely not cohesins) and how similar they are to analogous chromosome structures in non-Drosophila cells. Nevertheless, this might be important to emphasize since it may be challenging for a non-Drosophila, non-polytene-centric viewpoint to understand the relevance of this new and exciting Mad2 driven SIRS mechanism. Similarly, in the third paragraph of the Introduction, the description about \"endocycled cells\" and \"polyteny\" is somewhat unclear. First of all, it is unclear how one can distinguish polytene chromosomes from regular chromosomes (containing only single sister chromatid). For example, how one can surely tell 4N vs. 8N? Are diplochromosomes from 4N (N + N + N + N) easily distinguishable from 2N+2N+2N+2N from 8N chromosomes, which might look diplochromosomes but each containing double the amount of DNA?</i>"
