Evidence for the latter comes from the studies showing that neural signals in the OFC correlate with value across features. Yet features can co-vary with value, and individual units may participate in multiple ensembles coding different features. Here we used unblocking to test whether OFC neurons would respond to a predictive cue signaling a \u2018valueless\u2019 change in outcome flavor. Neurons were recorded as the rats learned about cues that signaled either an increase in reward number or a valueless change in flavor. We found that OFC neurons acquired responses to both predictive cues. This activity exceeded that exhibited to a \u2018blocked\u2019 cue and was correlated with activity to the actual outcome. These results show that OFC neurons fire to cues with no value independent of what can be inferred through features of the predicted outcome."

Evidence for the latter comes from the studies showing that neural signals in the OFC correlate with value across features. Yet features can co-vary with value, and individual units may participate in multiple ensembles coding different features. Here we used unblocking to test whether OFC neurons would respond to a predictive cue signaling a \u2018valueless\u2019 change in outcome flavor. Neurons were recorded as the rats learned about cues that signaled either an increase in reward number or a valueless change in flavor. We found that OFC neurons acquired responses to both predictive cues. This activity exceeded that exhibited to a \u2018blocked\u2019 cue and was correlated with activity to the actual outcome. These results show that OFC neurons fire to cues with no value independent of what can be inferred through features of the predicted outcome."

It turned out that the neurons in the OFC responded whenever the features changed, irrespective of whether or not the value changed.

Further, any neural element (voxel or single unit) may participate in ensembles responding to more than one feature, so it is also possible that a particular element that appears not to distinguish specific features of different outcomes is in fact coding independent features that co-vary with each outcome's value."

One way is to strip away or \u2018block\u2019 the value portion of the outcome during learning, while leaving unblocked\u2014free to enter into associations\u2014the outcome's unique sensory and other features. This can be done by pairing a \u2018target\u2019 cue with a rewarding outcome in the presence of a cue that has been previously trained to predict a differently-flavored, but similarly-valued outcome. When this is done, the previously conditioned cue predicts the general value that is common to the two outcomes, but does not predict the unique features that distinguish the new outcome (note features are not limited to sensory properties, but might include the outcome timing, location, temperature, size, number, etc). As a result, the target cue acquires associations with the unique features of the new outcome but not with its general or common currency value (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rescorla, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Burke et al., 2008</a>). If OFC neurons represent only a general or common currency value, divorced from features, then they should respond no more to such a target cue than to a completely blocked cue (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kamin, 1969</a>). However, if OFC neurons represent outcome features, independent of value, then they should respond to the target cue just as they do to a cue that has been explicitly unblocked by increasing the amount of the outcome delivered. Indeed, both pure value and outcome expectancy accounts of OFC function would predict neural activity to such an unblocked cue, but only an outcome expectancy account predicts encoding of the target cue signaling a valueless change in outcome flavor."

This training was meant to establish the initial odor as a reliable predictor of a specific flavor and number of drops of milk. Each rat had extensive experience with both flavors, thus neither flavor was novel. Following initial training rats were implanted with microelectrodes in the OFC.

One type was a reminder; the initially trained odor was followed by the expected outcome. On the other three trial types (blocked, number, flavor), rats were presented with the initially trained odor, followed immediately by one of three novel odors. On \u2018blocked\u2019 trials, the novel odor was followed by the expected two drops of the same flavor used in initial training. This outcome is fully predicted by the initial odor, thus the novel odor should be blocked from acquiring associative significance (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kamin, 1969</a>). On \u2018flavor\u2019 trials, the novel odor was followed by two drops of the flavor not used in initial training (i.e., chocolate or vanilla). Here the value is unchanged, since the two flavors are equally preferred and the same amount is delivered, but the features of the outcome are different. Thus the novel target odor should enter into associations with the unique features of the outcome (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rescorla, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Burke et al., 2008</a>). On \u2018number\u2019 trials, the novel odor was followed by an additional drop of the flavor used in the initial training. Since the initial odor does not predict anything after the second drop, the novel odor should enter into associations with both the features and the additional value of the outcome presented in the third drop (<a href=\"#bib8\">Holland, 1984</a>)."

In one test, given on days separate from unblocking, preference for each flavor over water was assessed. Both flavors were highly preferred to water (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), demonstrating both are highly palatable. The more important preference test came just following unblocking sessions, from which the critical neural data came. In these tests, the two milk flavors were pitted directly against one another. This test is critical to demonstrate that specific satiety to one flavor did not develop over the course of the unblocking session, a finding that would strongly suggest different valuation of the two flavors. Indeed, we found no evidence of a preference in these tests (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In both types of tests the locations of the bottles were swapped every 20\u201330 s, meaning that rats were required to switch locations if the solution did in fact differ in value. This pattern was present when either milk flavor was compared to water but was absent when the two flavors were directly compared. The consumption data demonstrate that both flavors were highly palatable yet of equivalent value. Finally, to ensure the two flavors were discriminable we subjected another set of rats to a selective conditioned flavor aversion procedure. After initial exposure to both milk flavors, consumption of one flavor (fully counterbalanced) was devalued by pairing with LiCl-induced nausea while consumption of the other was paired with saline injection that is of minimal consequence. At no point did rats show a preference for the chocolate or vanilla flavor but all rats selectively reduced consumption of the devalued flavor. This was apparent both in conditioning (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and in the final choice test (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Thus extensive consumption testing indicated that the flavors used were of equivalent value but readily discriminable."

Since these neurons fired to all of the odors, even the blocked odor, their firing cannot be easily explained as signaling information about the predicted outcomes. However they might be signaling information about the cues themselves, such as their shared sensory features or intrinsic salience. Unlike shared sensory features, salience should be higher for the novel cues than for the pre-trained, initial odor in our design, and this pattern should be most noticeable early in training when the novel cues were first presented. As a population, these neurons did show greater activity to the blocked, number and flavor odors than to the more familiar, initial odor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This effect was present despite the fact that we did not select based on this criterion. Further analyses of the individual units showed that many exhibited significantly higher firing to the novel odors than to the initial odor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and few exhibited differences in firing among the three novel odors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). Moreover, when we examined the firing of neurons in this population on the first 10 trials of unblocking (31/79 odor-responsive neurons; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), analyzing the difference in firing between the novel and initial odor cues in a sliding, 300-ms window across each trial, we found that activity in this population was maximal at the onset of the novel odors and on the first exposure and then declined rapidly on subsequent trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). This same pattern held when each novel odor was analyzed separately (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Further, this pattern was only seen on the first day of unblocking (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

The acquisition of differential firing to the flavor and number odors demonstrates that selective odor encoding was not driven by physical properties of the odors. If neurons were encoding the odor itself, independent of its outcome signaling, this would have been apparent on the very first trial. Thus, as a population, these neurons responded more strongly to the unblocked \u2018flavor\u2019 and \u2018number\u2019 odors than to the \u2018blocked\u2019 odor.

Thus these data confirm that many OFC neurons signal associative meaning independent of at least a general value. In support of this, odor firing in the flavor population, as well as the number population, was positively correlated with firing to the actual outcome delivered on each of these trials (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

Together these results point to a largely unappreciated role for this area in the modulation of attention for the purposes of learning (<a href=\"#bib5\">Esber et al., 2012</a>). Of course novelty is just one instance of \u2018salience\u2019. Modern learning theories describe salience as a function of both intrinsic and acquired properties.

Nearly all of these neurons fired more to these cues than to the similarly trained but fully blocked cue, and this activity was acquired with learning, a pattern consistent with signaling of the associative significance or meaning of these cues (or possibly their acquired salience). Importantly, the acquired neural activity was observed to both the explicitly unblocked \u2018number\u2019 cue as well as to the \u2018flavor\u2019 cue, which was unblocked by shifting the features of the expected outcome while holding the value constant. This was accomplished by using two differently-flavored but similarly-preferred outcomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). The lack of any flavor preference makes it unlikely that the cue added prior to this manipulation acquired what might be termed a general or cached value. Indeed, in prior work we have found that responding to this target cue in the probe test is dissociable from even the smallest animal-by-animal differences in conditioned or unconditioned responding to the two outcomes used (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schoenbaum et al., 2011</a>), indicating that it is not driven by any sort of shift in value that might accrue to the cue."

As evidence of this, it has been shown that cues trained in this manner support behavior that is more sensitive to (in fact completely dependent upon) the features of the predicted outcome\u2014or value inferred through those features\u2014than similar behaviors supported by cues directly paired with reward in isolation. For example, conditioned reinforcement supported by a normally trained cue is insensitive to devaluation of the predicted outcome (<a href=\"#bib26\">Parkinson et al., 2005</a>); however if the cue is trained like the \u2018flavor\u2019 cue in the current experiment, then devaluation of the predicted outcome completely abolishes the ability of the cue to serve as a conditioned reinforcer (<a href=\"#bib1\">Burke et al., 2008</a>). This result indicates that a cue trained in this manner has little or no intrinsic, cached or acquired value except what can be inferred through knowledge of the features of the outcome. This cue's special link to the sensory features of the outcome is also apparent in that such cues retain the ability to support Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer when that transfer is specific to the outcome (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rescorla, 1999</a>). Interestingly outcome-specific transfer is both insensitive to devaluation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Holland, 2004</a>) and disrupted by OFC lesions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</a>), results which are difficult to reconcile with the view that the OFC is directly involved in the representation of value."

Notably this population included neurons that fired only to the flavor cue as well as neurons that participated in both the flavor and number ensembles.

However such firing could equally well reflect associations with features of the additional outcome delivered on these trials, known to develop when additional rewards are delivered during unblocking (<a href=\"#bib8\">Holland, 1984</a>). While it is impossible to say for sure, the similarities in the overall level of neural activity to the flavor and number cues, their similar rates of development with learning, and the finding that neurons do develop activity to a valueless cue make the latter explanation the most parsimonious."

For example, the OFC is not required for simple Pavlovian or instrumental conditioning (<a href=\"#bib6\">Gallagher et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Izquierdo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Gremel and Costa, 2013</a>) discrimination learning (<a href=\"#bib32\">Schoenbaum et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Izquierdo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">McDannald et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Walton et al., 2010</a>), extinction by reward omission (<a href=\"#bib35\">Takahashi et al., 2009</a>), transfer (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</a>), and even perhaps reversal learning (<a href=\"#bib29\">Rudebeck et al., 2013</a>), all of which can be accomplished without reference to specific information about predicted outcomes. Similarly both blocking and unblocking\u2014when it can be accounted for by value\u2014do not require the OFC (<a href=\"#bib1\">Burke et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">McDannald et al., 2011</a>). While the preserved function in these studies could reflect compensation by other areas, it must at least call into question the idea that OFC, writ large, is fundamental to all behavior that reflects value, instead highlighting suggestions that common value representation may at least be limited to the medial subregion (<a href=\"#bib20\">Noonan et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2012</a>). Indeed recent work in humans has shown that OFC represents specific outcome features and that more lateral orbital areas represent those outcomes in a way that is dependent upon prior cues (<a href=\"#bib14\">Klein-Flugge et al., 2013</a>). Thus far from signaling general value about outcomes without regard to their features and attendant events, this work shows that the OFC maintains highly specific representations."

This is even true in the current paradigm, where we have shown that the OFC is required for the development of conditioned responding to the target cue paired with a shift in outcome identity but not to the target cue paired with additional outcome (<a href=\"#bib19\">McDannald et al., 2011</a>). Our present finding of robust encoding of a valueless Pavlovian cue that exceeds that of a blocked cue, and is equivalent to a cue paired with additional outcome, provides further support for outcome expectancy theories of OFC function."

Here, McDannald and colleagues test this directly by comparing cell responses in orbitofrontal cortex during two types of unblocking: one where the introduction of a novel cue after a familiar one is accompanied by an increase in the reward magnitude or a second type where a different novel cue is followed by a different flavored reward but of comparable value. This is contrasted with activity during blocking where a novel cue is followed by the same reward associated with the familiar cue. They study two major populations of OFC cells, one which responds to the novel cues on day 1, and a second which was selectively activated during both types of unblocking. This is an interesting manuscript that takes a novel approach to understanding frontal cortex function by creating cues with an associative significance but which do not indicate a value. The fact that neurons in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) respond to these cues is interesting and suggests that the prevalent view that the OFC just codes value is incorrect. We therefore think that the manuscript will be of broad interest. In general it is well written and clear."
