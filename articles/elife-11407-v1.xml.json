In <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, the virulence determining two-component system PhoQ/PhoP regulates the transcription of <i>mgtA</i> gene by sensing Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the periplasm. However, the factors that affect MgtA function are not known. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that MgtA is highly dependent on anionic phospholipids and in particular, cardiolipin. Colocalization studies confirm that MgtA is found in the cardiolipin lipid rafts in the membrane. We further show that MgtA is highly sensitive to free Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub>) levels in the solution. MgtA is activated when the Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration is reduced below 10 \u03bcM and is strongly inhibited above 1 mM, indicating that Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> acts as product inhibitor. Combined, our findings conclude that MgtA may act as a sensor as well as a transporter of Mg<sup>2+</sup>."
