                    "text": "Injury-induced (Wallerian) axonal degeneration is regulated via the opposing actions of pro-degenerative factors such as SARM1 and a MAPK signal and pro-survival factors, the most important of which is the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT2 that inhibits activation of the SARM1 pathway. Here we investigate the mechanism by which MAPK signaling facilitates axonal degeneration. We show that MAPK signaling promotes the turnover of the axonal survival factor NMNAT2 in cultured mammalian neurons as well as the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog dNMNAT in motoneurons. The increased levels of NMNAT2 are required for the axonal protection caused by loss of MAPK signaling. Regulation of NMNAT2 by MAPK signaling does not require SARM1, and so cannot be downstream of SARM1. Hence, pro-degenerative MAPK signaling functions upstream of SARM1 by limiting the levels of the essential axonal survival factor NMNAT2 to promote injury-dependent SARM1 activation. These findings are consistent with a linear molecular pathway for the axonal degeneration program."

Here we investigate the mechanism by which MAPK signaling facilitates axonal degeneration. We show that MAPK signaling promotes the turnover of the axonal survival factor NMNAT2 in cultured mammalian neurons as well as the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog dNMNAT in motoneurons. The increased levels of NMNAT2 are required for the axonal protection caused by loss of MAPK signaling. Regulation of NMNAT2 by MAPK signaling does not require SARM1, and so cannot be downstream of SARM1. Hence, pro-degenerative MAPK signaling functions upstream of SARM1 by limiting the levels of the essential axonal survival factor NMNAT2 to promote injury-dependent SARM1 activation. These findings are consistent with a linear molecular pathway for the axonal degeneration program."

Developing methods to maintain axons and preserve neural circuit integrity following injury or disease will require a mechanistic understanding of the axonal degeneration program (<a href=\"#bib9\">Conforti et al., 2014</a>). Injury-induced axonal degeneration is a regulated process of subcellular self-destruction that is controlled by the counteracting functions of axon survival and axon degenerative proteins. Over the past few years, essential survival and degenerative proteins have been identified (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gerdts et al., 2016</a>).

Here we study this interplay, and present a unified model that incorporates major axon survival and degenerative proteins into a linear pathway."

Overexpression of these factors delays or prevents injury-dependent axon degeneration, and loss of these factors accelerates or induces axon degeneration. NMNAT2, an NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzyme, is an essential axon survival factor whose loss is sufficient to trigger axon degeneration (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gilley and Coleman, 2010</a>). NMNAT2 has a very short half-life, and maintenance of NMNAT2 in the axon requires continuous anterograde transport. Axonal injury blocks axon transport, causing local NMNAT2 levels to fall and axon degeneration to initiate. Factors that slow the degradation of NMNAT2 profoundly delay axon degeneration after injury (<a href=\"#bib4\">Babetto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Milde et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Xiong et al., 2012</a>). SCG10, a microtubule regulating protein also known as Stathmin 2, is a less potent axonal survival factor whose loss speeds degeneration after injury but does not trigger degeneration in the absence of injury (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>). Like NMNAT2, SCG10 is a labile protein that is delivered to the axon via anterograde transport, and slowing its degradation protects axons (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>)."

The MAP3K dual leucine-zipper kinase (DLK) and its downstream MAPK JNK were the first axon degeneration factors identified (<a href=\"#bib24\">Miller et al., 2009</a>). This MAPK pathway was thought to play an ancillary role in the axonal degeneration program (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wang et al., 2012</a>) because loss of DLK only leads to a modest slowing of degeneration. Recently Yang and colleagues found redundancy at each level of the MAPK cascade, showing that loss of all of the relevant triple, double, or single kinases leads to a long-lasting block in axonal degeneration, and hence demonstrating that MAPK signaling is essential to promote local axon degeneration (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). SARM1 is another essential axon degeneration factor, and likely functions as the central executioner of the degenerative cascade. Loss of SARM1 protects axons after sciatic nerve injury, traumatic brain injury, or treatment with the chemotherapeutic drug vincristine in vivo in mouse (<a href=\"#bib10\">Geisler et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gerdts et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Henninger et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Osterloh et al., 2012</a>) and activated versions of SARM1 are sufficient to trigger axon degeneration (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gerdts et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2015</a>)."

Two studies suggest that loss of NMNAT2 is a likely trigger for SARM1 activation. Genetic analysis shows that knockdown of NMNAT2 in cultured neurons triggers SARM1-dependent axon degeneration, and the embryonic lethality of NMNAT2 knockout mice is fully rescued by the simultaneous loss of SARM1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gilley et al., 2015</a>). Biochemical studies demonstrate that expression of NMNAT enzymes blocks axon degeneration, not by increasing NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis, but rather by blocking SARM1-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sasaki et al., 2016</a>). These results support the model that loss of NMNAT2 activates SARM1 to induce degeneration. How does activated SARM1 cause axon loss? SARM1 is a TIR-domain containing protein, and dimerization of the SARM1-TIR domain is sufficient to trigger axon degeneration (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gerdts et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). Using this system, Gerdts et al. demonstrated that activated SARM1 triggers the rapid degradation of NAD<sup>+</sup> and the subsequent loss of ATP, inducing a metabolic catastrophe and axon loss (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gerdts et al., 2015</a>). Yang et al. showed that dimerizing the SARM1-TIR domains activates MAPK signaling, that injury induces a SARM1-dependent activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, and that MAPK signaling is required for ATP loss after injury (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). Hence activated SARM1 can induce both NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion and MAPK activation, but the relationship between these two activities is unknown."

We find that MAPK signaling is required for injury-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion and axonal degeneration, but surprisingly not for NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion or axon degeneration induced by activated SARM1. This suggests that MAPK signaling could function upstream of SARM1 to promote injury-dependent activation of SARM1. We previously demonstrated that MAPK signaling promotes the turnover of the axon survival factor SCG10 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>), and so hypothesized that MAPK signaling also promotes the turnover of the major axon survival factor NMNAT2. Here we show that inhibition of MAPK signaling slows the turnover of both NMNAT2 and SCG10, leading to increased levels of both survival factors. Moreover, the axon protection afforded by inhibiting MAPK signaling requires elevated levels of NMNAT2. This revises our understanding of how MAPK signaling promotes axon degeneration, placing MAPK signaling upstream of axon survival factor turnover and SARM1 activation. Our new findings unify major axon survival and degeneration proteins into a single, linear pathway."

This pathway includes the MAPKKKs DLK, MLK2, and MEKK4, the MAPKKs MKK4 and MKK7 (with MKK4 dominant), and the MAPKs JNK1-3. Within this pathway, the MAPKKs MKK4 and MKK7 represent a targetable bottleneck in which loss of these kinases abrogates the MAPK signaling necessary for axon degeneration (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). Lentiviral transduction of previously validated shRNAs targeting the MAPKKs MKK4 and MKK7 into mouse dorsal root ganglia neurons effectively down regulates the levels of MKK4 and MKK7 protein and confers robust axon protection after axotomy when used in tandem (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, by simultaneously knocking down MKK4 and MKK7 (hereafter abbreviated as MKK4/7 or sh4/7), we can interrogate the mechanism by which the MAPK pathway promotes axon degeneration."

We hypothesized that there could be a linear relationship between NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion and MAPK activation such that MAPK signaling is required for NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion or, conversely, that NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion is the trigger for MAPK activation. To investigate the relationship between MAPK signaling and NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion, we assessed whether MAPK signaling is necessary for NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion within axons after axotomy. At two and four hours after axotomy, a time when axons remain morphologically intact, axonal NAD<sup>+</sup> has decreased to 71% and 7% of baseline levels and is undetectable at six hours after axotomy in neurons expressing a control shRNA that targets luciferase. Strikingly, NAD<sup>+</sup> is maintained at 45% of baseline levels six hours after axotomy in the absence of MKK4/7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; p\u22640.001), revealing that MAPK signaling is upstream of axotomy-induced NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we assessed whether MKK4/7 activity is necessary for NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion induced by a constitutively active form of SARM1 that bypasses the need for injury-dependent SARM1 activation. To generate an activated form of SARM1, we used a pharmacologically controlled system in which the SARM1-TIR domain fused to FKBP is homodimerized upon application of the small molecule AP20187 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gerdts et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). Dimerization of the SARM1-TIR domains induces loss of NAD<sup>+</sup> within two hours, similar to the two hour window in which most NAD<sup>+</sup> is lost following axotomy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Surprisingly, knockdown of MKK4/7 does not change the rate of NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion after SARM1-TIR dimerization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). ATP is also depleted, albeit more slowly than NAD<sup>+</sup>, when SARM1-TIR domains are dimerized. As with NAD<sup>+</sup>, inhibition of MKK4/7 does not change the rate of ATP depletion induced by SARM1-TIR dimerization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

The strongest functional evidence for a role for MAPKs downstream of SARM1 in the axon destruction program is the finding that depletion of MKK4/7 partially blocks axon degeneration induced by direct dimerization of the SARM1-TIR domains (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). We reassessed this finding by simultaneously testing whether MAPKs are required for axon degeneration induced by either axotomy or dimerized SARM1-TIR. In control cultures both axotomy and dimerized SARM1-TIR induce robust axon degeneration. In contrast, depletion of MKK4/7 prevents axon degeneration for at least 24 hr after axotomy; however, in parallel experiments performed in the same dish, depletion of MKK4/7 fails to block axon degeneration induced by dimerization of the SARM1-TIR domains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>). JNK inhibition also fails to block axon degeneration induced by dimerization of the SARM1-TIR domains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These results are consistent with the findings in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> demonstrating that MAPK signaling is required for NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion following injury but not direct dimerization of SARM1-TIR. While we cannot replicate the finding that the MAPK pathway is required for SARM1-TIR induced axon degeneration, we do observe activation of MKK4 following SARM1-TIR dimerization (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) as reported by Yang <i>et al</i>. Hence, we agree that activated SARM1 can induce the MAPK stress pathway, but we find no functional evidence that this a significant modulator of NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion or axon loss. While we cannot explain why our findings differ from those of Yang et al., we suggest that epistasis experiments performed with engineered constructs such as the dimerized SARM1-TIR should be interpreted with care. As such, we chose to investigate the mechanism by which MAPK signaling promotes axotomy-induced axon degeneration. As is shown below, we identify a mechanism by which MAPK signaling acts upstream of endogenous SARM1 to inhibit axon degeneration, and this mechanism is fully consistent with the findings presented here with the dimerized SARM1-TIR."

We previously demonstrated that JNK promotes the turnover of a second axonal survival factor, the microtubule regulating protein SCG10, whose overexpression can also delay axon degeneration, albeit much less potently than NMNAT2 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>). This lead us to test the hypothesis that MAPK signaling might have a broader role in controlling the stability of axonal maintenance factors. We tested if MAPKs promote turnover of survival factors by assessing whether depletion of MKK4/7 leads to an increase in the levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10 protein. We first compared levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10 in the presence or absence of MKK4/7 under basal conditions. We find that levels of endogenous NMNAT2 and SCG10 are elevated in neurons upon MKK4/7 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and quantified in 3F; NMNAT2 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 fold increase, SCG10 5.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 fold increase). We observe a similar increase in the levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10 when we knockdown MKK4 with a second shRNA, and when we target MKK4 using the Cas9/CRISPR system (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Axon degeneration is regulated locally; therefore, we asked if MKK4/7 regulates axon survival factors within axons. Levels of endogenous NMNAT2 and SCG10 are elevated within axon-only lysate after depletion of MKK4/7 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; Nmnat2 3.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 fold increase, SCG10 4.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 fold increase). Similar results were observed following treatment with the JNK inhibitor VIII, where levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10 are boosted within two hours of JNK inhibition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

Hence we expressed myc-tagged NMNAT2 (NMNAT2-myc) in DRG neurons from the ubiquitin C promoter. Upon MKK4/7 knockdown, both NMNAT2-myc and SCG10 are elevated within axons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; p\u22640.001, n\u00a0=\u00a07\u20139).

We expressed HA-dNmnat in motoneurons using OK6-Gal4 and assessed levels of tagged dNmnat by immunostaining.

Hence, we tested whether the MKK4/7-dependent regulation of axonal survival factors occurs downstream of SARM1. If MKK4/7 function downstream of SARM1, then we predict that loss of SARM1 should phenocopy the loss of MKK4/7 and lead to an increase in the levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10. However, levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10 are comparable in wild type and SARM1 knockout neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013F</a>; not significant, n\u00a0=\u00a03; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gilley et al., 2015</a>). If SARM1 were upstream of MKK4/7, then we would further predict that MKK4/7 regulation of survival factors would require SARM1. To test this prediction, we knocked down MKK4/7 in both wild type and SARM1 knockout neurons and measured the levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10. We find that MKK4/7 regulate these axon survival factors even in the absence of SARM1, as levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10 are elevated upon knockdown of MKK4/7 in both wild type and SARM1 knockout neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013F</a>; in SARM1 knockout with shMKK4/7, NMNAT2 3.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 fold increase, SCG10 6.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4 fold increase compared to shRNA controls; not significant comparing genotypes). Thus, MAPK regulation of axon survival factors is independent of SARM1. Since elevated levels of NMNAT2 inhibits SARM1-dependent axon degeneration, these findings are consistent with the model that MAPK signaling functions upstream of SARM1."

Thus, we asked whether inhibition of MKK4/7 maintains elevated levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10 within the axon in the first hours after injury, when the axon commits to degenerate. We axotomized cultured DRG neurons and stained for myc-tagged NMNAT2 and endogenous SCG10. By four hours after axotomy, NMNAT2 is depleted and endogenous SCG10 is undetectable in distal axons from control neurons. However, four hours after axotomy NMNAT2 and SCG10 are maintained within distal axons from MKK4/7 knockdown neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Indeed, axonal levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10 are comparable at four hours post-axotomy from MKK4/7 knockdown neurons to the levels in uninjured axons from wild type neurons (for NMNAT2-myc, fluorescence intensity four hours after injury for shMKK4/7 is 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 fold (p&gt;0.05) of the levels measured in uninjured control axons; for SCG10, fluorescence intensity four hours after injury for shMKK4/7 is 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 fold (p&gt;0.05) of the levels measured in uninjured control axons (p&gt;0.05), n\u00a0=\u00a07\u20139). The four hour time-point is significant, as this is approximately the time at which axons irreversibly commit to degenerate after injury in vitro (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gerdts et al., 2016</a>). Hence, knockdown of MKK4/7 maintains axon survival factors at the time and place they are needed to inhibit the axon degeneration program."

We previously demonstrated that JNK inhibition slows the turnover rate of SCG10 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>). Hence, we postulated that MAPK signaling limits the levels of axon survival factors by promoting their turnover. To test this hypothesis, we assessed their half-life by treating cultured DRG neurons with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis and measured the levels of endogenous NMNAT2 and SCG10 within axons at various times after cycloheximide treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013E</a>). Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gilley and Coleman, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>), the normal turnover of NMNAT2 and SCG10 is rapid, with half-lives of approximately 1.1 and 1.5 hr, respectively. However, with MKK4/7 knockdown the turnover of these survival factors is slowed, with half-lives for NMNAT2 and SCG10 of approximately 3.4 and 2.7 hr, respectively.

To test this hypothesis we performed two additional experiments. First, we pre-treated DRG neurons with JNK inhibitor VIII for only 30 min, which does not allow for enough time for substantial buildup of protein. We then treated with cycloheximide and measured endogenous NMNAT2 and SCG10 turnover in axons. We find that even acute inhibition of JNK signaling is sufficient to delay the degradation of both survival factors, consistent with the model that MAPK signaling regulates protein turnover (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, we tested directly whether high levels of axonal NMNAT2 and SCG10 would hinder the degradation process and slow turnover. For this, we compared the turnover rate within axons of endogenous NMNAT2 and SCG10 to the turnover rate in cultures overexpressing high levels of NMNAT2-myc and wildtype SCG10. We observe no change in the degradation rate of survival factors when levels are increased over 5-fold higher than endogenous levels, which is even more than the increase in protein levels that we observe with depletion of MKK4/7 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Hence, the slowed turnover is not due to the higher levels of these proteins. Finally, there is no increase in transcript levels of either NMNAT2 or SCG10 after depletion of MKK4/7 as assessed by rt-PCR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These findings are all consistent with the model that MAPK signaling promotes the turnover of NMNAT2 and SCG10. While turnover is slowed, NMNAT2 and SCG10 are still lost in the absence of MKK4/7, albeit at a slower rate, indicating that there are likely MAPK-independent mechanisms promoting their degradation."

Since increased levels of NMNAT2 are sufficient to delay axon degeneration following injury, we hypothesized that the axonal protection afforded by MKK4/7 knockdown is due to the elevation of NMNAT2 levels. To test this model, we simultaneously depleted MKK4/7 with shRNAs and used guide RNAs (gRNAs) to knockout NMNAT2 in cultured Cas9 knockin DRG neurons and assessed the rate of axon degeneration following axotomy. Knockout of NMNAT2 using gRNAs fully blocks the increase in NMNAT2 protein levels induced by MKK4/7 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and also abrogates the axonal protection resulting from MKK4/7 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Following axotomy, axons from control neurons degenerate after 6 hr, yet 24 hr after axotomy axons from MKK4/7 knockdown neurons remain intact with addition of control scrambled gRNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Indeed, with the simultaneous knockdown of MKK4/7 and NMNAT2 axons degenerate at 6 hr after axotomy, the same time point at which wildtype axons begin to degenerate. Hence, NMNAT2 is required for the axonal protection afforded by MKK4/7 knockdown, indicating that the protective effect of inhibiting MAPK signaling is conferred by elevated levels of NMNAT2. NMNAT2 knockdown does not block the protection afforded by deletion of SARM1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>), consistent with previous findings showing that NMNAT2 functions upstream of SARM1 to inhibit axonal degeneration (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gilley et al., 2015</a>)."

While overexpression of NMNAT2 and SCG10 each confer axon protection after injury (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gilley and Coleman, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>), inhibition of MAPK signaling elevates the levels of these proteins in tandem. To test of whether SCG10 could enhance NMNAT2-induced axon protection, we simultaneously overexpressed NMNAT2 and SCG10 in order to mimic this coordinate up regulation. We overexpressed SCG10-AA (S62/73A), a more stable form of the protein in which JNK phosphorylation sites are mutated (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>), and NMNAT2-myc singly or in combination in otherwise wild type cultured DRG neurons. Overexpression of SCG10-AA delays axon degeneration after axotomy by about 3 hr compared to control, consistent with the very modest axon protection previously described (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>). Overexpression of NMNAT2-myc protects axons for 36 hr after axotomy. Surprisingly, co-expression of SCG10-AA and NMNAT2-myc results in robust axon protection for at least 72 hr (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D</a>). The extent of protection is comparable to that achieved via overexpression of cytoplasmic NMNAT1, the most axo-protective gain-of-function manipulation described to-date (<a href=\"#bib3\">Babetto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Sasaki et al., 2009a</a>). Thus, elevation of NMNAT2 and SCG10 confers robust protection, indicating that these factors either function synergistically or contribute to parallel pathways to prevent axon degeneration. These results are consistent with the model that MAPK signaling promotes axonal degeneration by coordinately down regulating axon survival factors (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

The continued degradation of survival factors allows levels of survival factors to drop below a critical threshold, thereby activating SARM1. Activated SARM1 rapidly depletes NAD<sup>+</sup>, leading to depletion of ATP and induction of a metabolic crisis that drives axon fragmentation. Our studies identify a critical function for MAPK signaling upstream of endogenous SARM1, however forced dimerization of SARM1-TIR can activate JNK, and so there could be additional roles for MAPK signaling downstream of SARM1."

Here we show that MAPK signaling promotes axonal NMNAT2 protein turnover both in mouse DRG neurons in culture and <i>Drosophila</i> motoneurons in vivo. Moreover, this increase in NMNAT2 levels is necessary for the axon protection afforded by knockdown of MKK4 and MKK7. In addition, MAPK signaling promotes the turnover of the only other identified axonal survival factor, SCG10. Taken together, these data fit the model that MAPK signaling promotes axonal degeneration by limiting the levels of axon survival factors."

However, SARM1 activity can induce MAPK activation (this manuscript; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hayakawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Inoue et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Tong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2015</a>), which would be consistent with an alternative model in which SARM1 activates MAPK signaling which then promotes the turnover of NMNAT2 as part of a positive feedback loop. We tested and excluded this feedback loop model using SARM1 knockout neurons. SARM1 knockout neurons do not have elevated levels of NMNAT2 or SCG10 at steady state, and the regulation of NMNAT2 and SCG10 by MKK4/7 does not require SARM1. The Coleman group reported similar findings in injured axons, demonstrating that NMNAT2 is still degraded after injury in SARM1 knockout neurons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gilley et al., 2015</a>). These data are incompatible with the feedback loop model. Instead, the finding that MKK4/7 regulate the levels of these axon survival factors in the absence of SARM1 is genetic proof that for this activity MAPK signaling does not function downstream of SARM1. However, it does not exclude the possibility that SARM1-dependent activation of MAPK signaling plays a modulatory role that was not discernable in our functional studies."

SCG10 is phosphorylated by JNK kinases (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Tararuk et al., 2006</a>), and we showed that mutating these phosphorylation sites slows SCG10 turnover in axons (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>). However, we also demonstrated that inhibiting JNK kinases further slows the turnover of this mutant SCG10, suggesting additional mechanisms of regulation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>). For NMNAT2 we do not know the mechanism. We have mutated candidate phosphorylation sites, but have not identified sites required for MAPK regulation (unpublished findings). NMNAT2 turnover is regulated by palmitoylation, localization, and the ubiquitin ligase Highwire/PHR1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Babetto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Milde and Coleman, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Milde et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Xiong et al., 2012</a>).

In this model MAPK signaling limits the levels of NMNAT2, and NMNAT2 in turn inhibits the activation of SARM1. Upon injury, anterograde transport of NMNAT2 is blocked, thereby causing a local reduction in NMNAT2 as a consequence of constitutive protein degradation. When NMNAT2 levels fall below a critical threshold, SARM1 is activated, leading to a precipitous drop in NAD<sup>+</sup> and ATP levels, energetic crisis, and axon destruction. In this model, MAPK activity is a rheostat controlling the levels of NMNAT2 and hence the propensity for an axon to degenerate. Such tuning might be particularly important in chronic conditions such as neuropathy in which axonal transport of survival factors may be impaired but not completely blocked, as it is following axotomy."

For example, AKT activity is mildly axoprotective, and inhibits MAPK signaling via direct phosphorylation of MKK4 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wakatsuki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). The ubiquitin ligase Highwire/PHR1 targets NMNAT2 for degradation, and loss of this ligase is potently axoprotective (<a href=\"#bib4\">Babetto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Xiong et al., 2012</a>). The axoprotective mechanism of action of SCG10 is unknown, but we previously demonstrated that maintaining SCG10 in injured axons enhances axonal transport (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>). We show that co-expression of SCG10 with NMNAT2 greatly enhances axon protection after injury, and so speculate that SCG10 could facilitate the transport of NMNAT2 to its sites of action within the injured axon. To date no proteins have been identified that directly regulate SARM1, but we anticipate that such molecules would potently modulate axon degeneration. We suggest that knowledge of the core axonal degeneration program presented here will provide a framework for understanding the molecular mechanism of newly identified players in this pathway."

Neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, and blocked as described (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2012</a>). NMNAT2-myc was detected with anti-myc tag antibody (9B11; CST #2276), and neurons were co-stained with anti-\u03b23 tubulin. Larval filet preps of third instar larva were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Blocking and staining were performed in PBS\u00a0+\u00a00.1% Triton X-100\u00a0+\u00a05% goat serum. All <i>Drosophila</i> samples were mounted and imaged in 70% glycerol containing Vectashield. Samples were imaged on a Leica DMI 4000B Confocal microscope using 40x or 60x oil objectives. Images are maximal Z-projections of confocal stacks. Samples for each experiment were processed simultaneously with identical confocal gain settings. Intensity of NMNAT2-myc and SCG10 in DRGs was quantified using ImageJ by determining the mean grey value within the total axonal area as defined by Tuj1 staining with background subtracted. A similar strategy was employed for intensity of HA-dNMNAT, with HRP labeling total axonal area."

Reviewer 3 asks whether this is due to axonal turnover depending on concurrent MAP kinase activity, or increased axonal loading overwhelming the normal course of degradation. A suggested experiment would involve increasing the levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10 in cells (to levels comparable to those seen with MKK4/7/ depletion) and show that the rate of degradation is unaltered."

Several highly conserved components involved in axotomy induced injury have been identified, including a critical prodegenerative component SARM, a distinctive MAPK pathway comprised of DLK/MEKK4/JNKs, and an anti-degenerative metabolic enzyme NMNAT. Together these molecules alter the metabolic state of axons, and regulate axonal degeneration. Additional components, including ubiquitinating enzymes, Bcl2 family members, caspases, and calpain have all been tied to regulation of axon degeneration. Here Walker et al. try to develop a cohesive view of these multiple components, and how they work together. The findings presented contradict a recent paper in the field. While that study concluded that SARM is upstream of the MAPK cascade, the present study reaches the opposite conclusion, namely that MAPK regulates degradation of NMNAT2 (and other components). Thus, in reviewing the paper, I tried to consider both how the current study differs from Yang et al., and also how well the current model is explored. A major problem (with both studies) is the push to place all these components in a single linear pathway. The impetus to place all the components in a linear pathway may have oversimplified this complex process."

The authors note that this enhances the viability of neurons transfected with shRNA constructs. However, the Tessier-Lavigne group has reported that bclxl can promote axonal survival and prevent degeneration. Therefore, this overexpression could definitely alter the results throughout the study (all experimental figures with the exception of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> seem to be affected by this issue)."

IF this is true, then genetic epistasis experiments showing that MAPK is not needed for the activity of a constitutively active SARM, do not indicate that MAPK must be downstream of SARM. I believe there could indeed be a feedback loop. The authors considered, and rejected this possibility. The rejection of this model was based on evidence that MAPK regulates NMNAT2 in the absence of SARM. Again, this result is only problematic if the authors feel that there is a single input into this MAPK cascade."

Does activated SARM stimulate the DLK/Mkk4/JNK pathway? To address this question, the authors should look at phosphorylation or catalytic activity of pathway components as an indicator that the MAPK cascade is activated. This is particularly important since the genetic epistasis experiments are not all consistent, and it is likely that many of the pathway components have multiple functions."

Specifically, this manuscript elucidates the order of events that have been recently shown to be key mediators of this pathway, namely-MAPK, NMNAT, and Sarm1. The authors here show that MKK4/7 are important for the loss of NAD<sup>+</sup> in axons in response to axotomy and find that MKK4/7 depletion does not prevent the loss of NAD<sup>+</sup> in neurons where Sarm1 is directly activated. These findings are interesting because MKK4/7 was previously shown to function after the point of Sarm1 activation to mediate axon degeneration. However, a major point of this manuscript is MKK4/7 functions before the point of Sarm1 activation in this pathway."

Both the Tessier-Lavigne group and our groups have published that Bcl-XL overexpression <i>does not influence</i> the SARM1 Wallerian degeneration program. Indeed, the one point of experimental (rather than interpretational) disagreement between our work and the work of Yang et al. relates to the degeneration induced by dimerizing the SARM1-TIR domain. Importantly, Yang et al. state that this degeneration <i>is not influenced</i> by overexpression of Bcl-XL. In the Yang et al. paper, the Tessier-Lavigne group finds that \u201cTreatment of sensory neurons expressing FKBP(F36V)-TIR with AP20187 induced degeneration of distal axons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G and H</a>), which appears independent of the apoptotic pathway since it was not affected by genetic deletion of caspase-9 or <i><span class=\"underline\">overexpression of Bcl-xl</span> </i>(data not shown)\u201d (Yang et al., 2015). We also previously demonstrated that Bcl-XL overexpression does not affect axon degeneration induced by activated SARM 1 (Gerdts et al., 2013, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). We have also previously published that overexpression of Bcl-XL does not influence the progression of axotomy-induced axon degeneration, which is dependent on full-length SARM1 (Vohra et al., 2010, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Reviewer one notes that the Tessier-Lavigne group has demonstrated an important role for Bcl-XL in inhibiting axon degeneration, but that is in the paradigm of NGF-deprivation not axotomy. The Tessier-Lavigne group has shown that NGF-deprivation activates a different molecular pathway than is used in the SARM1-dependent Wallerian degeneration pathway (Simon et al., 2012, 2016). We have published a similar finding for the role of Bcl-XL in NGF-deprivation induced axon degeneration (Vohra et al., 2010). Finally, the contradiction between our work and the work of Yang et al. would not be explained by the expression of Bcl-XL even if a role for Bcl-XL had not been previously excluded by the publications above. We find that knockdown of MKK4/7 does not block SARM1-TIR-induced axon degeneration, while Yang et al. does see protection. The <i>lack</i> of protection in our system could not be explained by the expression of a protective factor such as Bcl-XL."

We think this reconciles some of the apparent contradiction between our work and the Yang et al. study.

We go on to find a downstream function of MAPK signaling (increased levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10), we show that this function is <i>not downstream of SARM1</i> because it occurs in SARM1 KO neurons, and demonstrate that this function is necessary for the protection afforded by loss of MAPK signaling in our epistasis experiments.
