Neoblasts, originally defined as undifferentiated cells residing in the adult parenchyma, are frequently compared to embryonic stem cells yet their developmental origin remains obscure. We investigated the provenance of neoblasts during <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> embryogenesis, and report that neoblasts arise from an anarchic, cycling <i>piwi-1+</i> population wholly responsible for production of all temporary and definitive organs during embryogenesis. Early embryonic <i>piwi-1+</i> cells are molecularly and functionally distinct from neoblasts: they express unique cohorts of early embryo enriched transcripts and behave differently than neoblasts in cell transplantation assays. Neoblast lineages arise as organogenesis begins and are required for construction of all major organ systems during embryogenesis. These subpopulations are continuously generated during adulthood, where they act as agents of tissue homeostasis and regeneration."

Neoblasts, originally defined as undifferentiated cells residing in the adult parenchyma, are frequently compared to embryonic stem cells yet their developmental origin remains obscure. We investigated the provenance of neoblasts during <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> embryogenesis, and report that neoblasts arise from an anarchic, cycling <i>piwi-1+</i> population wholly responsible for production of all temporary and definitive organs during embryogenesis. Early embryonic <i>piwi-1+</i> cells are molecularly and functionally distinct from neoblasts: they express unique cohorts of early embryo enriched transcripts and behave differently than neoblasts in cell transplantation assays. Neoblast lineages arise as organogenesis begins and are required for construction of all major organ systems during embryogenesis. These subpopulations are continuously generated during adulthood, where they act as agents of tissue homeostasis and regeneration."

An atlas of the genes that are expressed in various embryonic tissues and in major organs as they begin to develop was also created. These tools, and the results of cell transplantation experiments, revealed that neoblasts emerge from embryonic stem cells as the major organs start to form. As the emerging neoblasts start to express the same combination of genes as adult neoblasts, they also begin to behave just like these cells. The populations of neoblasts remain present throughout the life of the flatworm, helping to maintain, repair and regenerate tissues."

This information could potentially help to develop treatments that stimulate regeneration in patients with degenerative diseases or traumatic injuries."

In flies, fish, mice and humans, adult somatic stem cells are fate-restricted, sustaining production of cell lineage(s) in resident tissues (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fuchs and Segre, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wagers and Weissman, 2004</a>). Although embryonic stem cells cultured ex vivo remain capable of producing a diversity of tissue types from different germ layers, such plasticity is typically lost from most somatic cells as development proceeds.

In addition, single animal replicates were prepared from C4 and virgin sexually mature adults (SX). RNA-Seq libraries were analyzed for four biological replicates (i.e., four individuals) per stage (Materials and methods). Identification of appropriate reference(s) and normalization methods was challenging due to vast differences in sample composition and complexity among different stages. However, clustering of replicates and discrete separation of stages was seen in a multidimensional scaling plot (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). Replicates for a given stage generally showed strong correlation among themselves despite not having controlled for differences in genetic background or embryo size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). Notably the S2 and S3 replicates, generated from embryos undergoing sphere formation and nascent spheres, respectively, were intermingled in expression space, showed the greatest variability and few significant differences in gene expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J\u2013K</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The goal of the pairwise comparisons was to identify transcripts with the starkest changes in expression in either direction, without constraints on transcript behavior at other points during embryogenesis. In contrast, the mixed stage reference comparisons maximized the likelihood of identifying transcripts exhibiting stage-specific expression, and only upregulated transcripts were analyzed. Stringent criteria were applied in both scenarios for flagging differentially expressed transcripts, including thresholds based on the Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value, fold-change, normalized RPKM expression level for time points, and identification of at least one open reading frame in the transcript (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). More upregulated transcripts were identified in the mixed stage reference than in\u00a0pairwise comparisons, perhaps due to increased sequencing depth of the averaged reference samples, which may enable more reliable detection of lowly expressed transcripts. Furthermore, identification of S2-enriched transcripts suggested that the whole embryo sequencing approach was sensitive enough to detect transcripts expressed in rare cell populations (i.e., blastomeres and differentiated cells making up the embryo proper). Non-redundant lists of upregulated transcripts, resulting from the union of the pairwise and mixed reference comparisons, served as molecular fingerprints for each time point for downstream analyses, including hierarchical clustering and GO analysis (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The molecular staging resource (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>) incorporates representative images (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), gene expression signatures (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s10\">10</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#SD8-data\">8</a>) and written summaries of key developmental events (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>), defining S1\u2013S8.

Double fluorescent WISH on S3\u2013S5 embryos revealed that <i>PCNA</i> and <i>RRM2-2</i> were expressed exclusively in <i>piwi-1+</i> blastomeres, all of which were cycling (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media4\">4</a>).

                                "text": "Numerous neoblast-enriched transcripts, identified through whole asexual animal irradiation studies and cell sorting (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Labb\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Rossi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Solana et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Wurtzel et al., 2015</a>), have been vetted for co-expression with <i>piwi-1+</i> and ascribed function(s) in neoblast proliferation, maintenance or cell fate commitment. Some neoblast-enriched transcripts, including those encoding nuage components and cell cycle regulators, are expressed in all neoblasts, whereas others are predominantly expressed in subpopulation(s) of cells that may be primed to adopt differentiated fates (<a href=\"#bib78\">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>). To address similarities in the gene expression profiles of the <i>piwi-1+</i> population during embryogenesis and adulthood, the expression trends of 242 adult asexual neoblast-enriched transcripts were examined using the molecular staging series data. Neoblast-enriched transcript membership was determined by sequences downregulated in whole animals following lethal irradiation across three independent experiments (<a href=\"#bib15\">Duncan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>) (Chen and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, personal communication). Strikingly, most adult asexual neoblast-enriched transcripts were expressed throughout embryogenesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). 74% (n\u00a0=\u00a0180) of the neoblast-enriched transcripts had average RPKM values per embryo\u00a0\u22651.0 in S2 embryos and 52% (n\u00a0=\u00a0128) transcripts had five-fold or greater expression levels in S2 embryos versus yolk, raising the possibility that other adult stem cell genes were expressed in blastomeres. Consistent with this idea, 41% of the adult asexual neoblast-enriched transcripts (n\u00a0=\u00a099) were present in the molecular expression signature(s) for S2\u2013S5 embryos (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#SD5-data\">5</a>, <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Expression of neoblast-enriched transcripts usually peaked during S4 or S5, prior to construction of the definitive organ systems, and diminished thereafter (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). The apparent decrease in expression after S5 was likely attributable to drastic changes in the complexity of the single embryo RNA samples during organogenesis, and was similarly observed for <i>piwi-1</i> and the cell cycle regulators <i>PCNA</i> and <i>RRM2-2</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Taken together, these findings suggest that many adult asexual neoblast markers, including genes implicated in DNA replication and repair, cell cycle control, chromatin remodeling and/or modification, genome surveillance and pluripotency, are also likely to be expressed throughout the <i>piwi-1+</i> population during embryogenesis. Moreover, shared elements of the blastomere and neoblast expression signatures, including DNA replication and repair pathway, cell cycle, nuage and RNA processing genes, are prominent features of an evolutionarily conserved gene expression signature for metazoan primordial stem cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ali\u00e9 et al., 2015</a>)."

First, EEE transcripts are uniquely associated with the expression signature(s) of undifferentiated <i>piwi-1+</i> blastomeres in early embryos. Second, adult neoblast subclasses arise as lineages are born within <i>piwi-1+</i> blastomeres during S5. Molecular heterogeneity within the neoblast compartment is largely attributed to the diverse array of lineage-dedicated progenitors within the population, a hypothesis supported by our finding that subclass marker expression was dramatically upregulated as organogenesis began. Progenitor subpopulations required for organ formation during embryogenesis persist into adulthood, where steady-state output from different lineages maintains tissue homeostasis. At present, we cannot distinguish whether lineages perpetually re-emerge due to asymmetric division of pluripotent stem cells, or whether progenitor populations established during embryogenesis are maintained by self-renewal. These observations beg the question: do <i>piwi-1+</i> cells behave similarly to neoblasts throughout embryogenesis? Or alternatively, is neoblast activity an acquired feature that emerges in tandem with the adult molecular expression signature?"

We propose that cNeoblasts arise during S5. Heterochronic transplantation experiments revealed that S6, S7 and S8 embryos possess cells that behaved similarly to adult cNeoblasts: they consistently engrafted into adult hosts, proliferated and were ultimately capable of mounting a rescue response (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013G</a>). Acquisition of cNeoblast activity during embryogenesis correlates temporally with large-scale changes in gene expression observed at the outset of organogenesis, suggesting that pluripotent stem cells and lineage-primed progenitors first emerge during S5 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). The ontogeny of the adult neoblast compartment can therefore be traced back to the <i>piwi-1+</i> zygote, which gives rise to anarchic, cycling <i>piwi-1+</i> blastomeres, some of which persist in the S3\u2013S4 embryonic wall and establish pluripotent neoblasts and progenitor subpopulations during S5. The remarkable developmental plasticity of adult planarians is likely due to the singular ability of neoblasts to perpetuate and redeploy embryonic developmental programs."

Z-stacks were taken every 45\u02da around the surface of the samples using a rotating stage, producing eight stacks of images per embryo. Multiview data sets were reconstructed using Fiji SPIM plugins for data registration and fusion (<a href=\"#bib56\">Preibisch et al., 2010</a>). Reconstructed data sets were viewed in the Imaris software package, where they were cropped and masked to remove beads. Cell positions and the embryonic pharynx were marked manually using the 3D Spot Finder function, and the three-dimensional coordinates for marked cells were exported into excel for analysis of cell positions. Colocalization was determined manually on S3\u2013S4 whole embryos, or on crop3D sections (100 \u00b5m X 200 \u00b5m X 100 \u00b5m) of S5 embryos."

The authors provide a comprehensive characterization of <i>S. mediterranea</i> embryogenesis by meticulously cataloguing (with corresponding gene expression data and expression mapping) the different stages of embryonic development. This groundwork allowed the authors to ask when neoblasts originate during embryogenesis. The authors demonstrate that neoblasts arise from anarchic, cycling <i>piwi</i>-1+ cells, which generate all temporary and definitive tissues/organs during embryonic development. Interestingly, early embryonic <i>piwi</i>-1+ cells have a distinct molecular signature from neoblasts. Unlike neoblasts, which express transcription factors (TFs) important for development, early embryonic <i>piwi</i>-1+ cells express \"early embryo enriched\" (EEE) transcripts. Later in embryogenesis when organogenesis initiates, EEE transcripts are downregulated while various developmental TFs are upregulated. Strikingly, in an elegant set of transplantation experiments, the authors demonstrate that <i>piwi</i>-1+ cells are functionally different at different embryonic stages. Similar to transplanted adult neoblasts, transplanted <i>piwi</i>-1+ cells from embryos undergoing organogenesis can rescue lethally irradiated planarians that are devoid of neoblasts, whereas, early EEEhi/TFlo <i>piwi</i>-1+ cells cannot."

Panel C shows the number of <i>piwi</i>-1+ cells per transplant at 1 hpt. For example, in Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2, one can see that comparable numbers of <i>piwi</i>-1+ cells were transplanted from S5 and S6 embryos (1 hpt) but at 5 dpt, very few to zero <i>piwi</i>-1+ cells remain from S5 donors compared to S6 (panel E). Furthermore, irradiated hosts transplanted with S5 <i>piwi</i>-1+ donor cells are not rescued (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>).

We reorganized <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a> (now <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig9\">9</a>, respectively) and rewrote the associated text and Figure Legends; we also rewrote much of the text accompanying <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. To aid readers, we reorganized all of the supplemental data so that items are noted chronologically in the text. Supplementary files were broken down into supplemental figures, source data and rich media files. We hope this encourages readers to delve into the wealth of data provided with our manuscript. In addition, we generated an online searchable resource (<a href=\"https://planosphere.stowers.org\">https://planosphere.stowers.org</a>) that houses the Molecular Staging Series and Molecular Fate Mapping Atlas. This resource, hosted by the Stowers Institute, will be freely available upon publication and will reference our published manuscript."

We concede that the side by side comparison would be nice to see, though not necessary. There were two reasons for this: 1) We strongly suspected that S8 embryonic cells would rescue since animals at this stage regenerate following amputation (our unpublished observation). The regeneration capacity, coupled with the distribution of <i>piwi-1+</i> cells in S8 embryos, suggested strongly to us that upon hatching juvenile worms possess neoblasts. Had we not achieved reproducible rescue results with S8 embryonic donor cells, we certainly would have pursued adult neoblast injection experiments. 2) The published cell transplantation papers used C4 asexual adult animals as donors. Differences in transplanted cell behavior using C4 animals and embryos as donors could arguably be attributed to differences in biotype. While sexually mature adult donor tissue has been shown to rescue in plug graft experiments, we presently don\u2019t have a cell sorting protocol for neoblast isolation from sexually mature adults. Our cell sorting protocols are based on DNA content, as well as cell size and morphology; we would expect our neoblast enriched fraction to be contaminated with dividing germline stem cells and transit amplifying germ cells. This would not be insignificant, given that adults possess roughly 100 testes."

However, these animals never generate a blastema or regenerate new tissue. None of the lethally irradiated, uninjected sexual adult hosts survived long-term, nor did they mount a regenerative response (e.g., head blastema formation) prior to lysing. The most parsimonious explanation for our results is that engrafted, proliferating, donor-derived <i>piwi-1+</i> cells contributed differentiating progeny that subsequently mounted the observed regenerative response in rescue animals. We have seen production of post-mitotic, definitive epidermal progenitors in S5 donor cell transplants (<i>NB.21.11e+</i> and <i>AGAT-1+</i> cells) at 10 dpt (13 dpi); these definitive epidermal progenitors were present in the tail parenchyma in the neighborhood of <i>piwi-1+</i> cells. Moreover, <i>NB.21.11e+</i> and <i>AGAT-1+</i> cells are irreversibly eliminated by lethal irradiation within 5 dpi, suggesting that the cells present in S5 transplanted hosts at 10 dpt (13 dpi) differentiated from donor-derived <i>piwi-1+</i> cells. Additional transplant experiments would be required to examine production of differentiating progeny for other lineages. SNPs could be assessed in donor and transplanted hosts after long-term reconstitution; however, this would require using genetically defined lines for embryonic donor cells, which we did not do for these experiments. We agree that using vital membrane dyes to track donor cells would be a good way of assessing donor versus host contribution following transplantation, and will pursue this suggestion in the future."

The first paragraph of the section, \u201cAn anarchic, cycling <i>piwi-1+</i> blastomeres fuel <i>Smed</i> embryonic development,\u201d describes the <i>EF1a-like-1</i> expression in S2 and S3 embryos, and includes detailed descriptions of embryonic cell types and architecture. <i>EF1a-like-1</i> is a pan-embryonic marker, meaning that it is expressed in differentiated temporary embryonic tissues (the primitive ectoderm, the temporary embryonic pharynx, the primitive gut) and the undifferentiated blastomeres located in the embryonic wall (the parenchymal space between the primitive ectoderm and endoderm) of S3 embryos. <i>EF1a-like-1</i> is not expressed in yolk cells. Yolk cells are present in the embryonic wall along with the blastomeres; these cells have very small, condensed sytox green+ nuclei. Ingested yolk is also present in the primitive gut cavity. Blastomere nuclei are larger, with diffuse sytox green signal (likely due to the decondensed nature of the chromatin), are easily distinguished from yolk cell nuclei in the embryonic wall. In addition, the blastomere nuclei are readily distinguished from primitive ectodermal nuclei by sytox green staining; latter are stretched and sit at the surface of the sphere. We are confident that the combination of <i>EF1a-like-1</i> and nuclear staining makes allows for unambiguous identification of undifferentiated blastomeres in the embryonic wall of S3 embryos. <i>Piwi-1</i> expression was always restricted to, and expressed throughout, the undifferentiated blastomere compartment of S3 embryos in <i>EF1a-like-1, piwi-1</i> costaining experiments.

Differential transcript stability, relative contributions of maternal load and zygotic transcription, and different modes of maternal mRNA degradation may all be at play and could be investigated in the future. We also note that some EEE transcripts do appear to be expressed exclusively in differentiated cell types, like the temporary embryonic pharynx and the primitive ectoderm. This is consistent with the idea that cells turn on different genetic programs as they differentiate, and suggests that these EEE transcripts are transcribed zygotically, during or after the cell fate decision to downreguate piwi-1, exit the cell cycle and differentiate."
