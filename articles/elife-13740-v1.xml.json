Here, we discover that mammalian Pol\u03b8 transfers nucleotides to the 3\u2019 terminus of DNA during alt-EJ in vitro and in vivo by oscillating between three different modes of terminal transferase activity: non-templated extension, templated extension <i>in cis</i>, and templated extension <i>in trans</i>. This switching mechanism requires manganese as a co-factor for Pol\u03b8 template-independent activity and allows for random combinations of templated and non-templated nucleotide insertions. We further find that Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity is most efficient on DNA containing 3\u2019 overhangs, is facilitated by an insertion loop and conserved residues that hold the 3\u2019 primer terminus, and is surprisingly more proficient than terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. In summary, this report identifies an unprecedented switching mechanism used by Pol\u03b8 to generate genetic diversity during alt-EJ and characterizes Pol\u03b8 as among the most proficient terminal transferases known."

Here, we discover that mammalian Pol\u03b8 transfers nucleotides to the 3\u2019 terminus of DNA during alt-EJ in vitro and in vivo by oscillating between three different modes of terminal transferase activity: non-templated extension, templated extension <i>in cis</i>, and templated extension <i>in trans</i>. This switching mechanism requires manganese as a co-factor for Pol\u03b8 template-independent activity and allows for random combinations of templated and non-templated nucleotide insertions. We further find that Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity is most efficient on DNA containing 3\u2019 overhangs, is facilitated by an insertion loop and conserved residues that hold the 3\u2019 primer terminus, and is surprisingly more proficient than terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. In summary, this report identifies an unprecedented switching mechanism used by Pol\u03b8 to generate genetic diversity during alt-EJ and characterizes Pol\u03b8 as among the most proficient terminal transferases known."

In this pathway, certain enzymes trim back DNA strands on both sides of the double-stranded break to expose overhanging single strands of DNA. Pol\u03b8 binds to the ends of both overhanging strands and helps them pair up with each other. Pol\u03b8 then extends each single strand using the opposing overhanging strand as a template. After the gaps are filled, the DNA junction is sealed to form double-stranded DNA by other enzymes."

Kent et al. also found that extra DNA pieces are inserted in all these three different modes of activity, and that this process occurs in mouse cells too. Additionally, single-stranded extension without a template was shown to be stimulated by manganese ions."

Intriguingly, bacterial and eukaryotic cells encode for multiple different types of Pols, some of which are intrinsically error-prone due to their relatively open active sites which enables them to tolerate particular DNA lesions\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Foti and Walker, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Lange et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Sale et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Waters et al., 2009</a>). Such enzymes are referred to as translesion polymerases and are mostly among the Y-family of polymerases\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Foti and Walker, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Lange et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Sale et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Waters et al., 2009</a>). Although these specialized polymerases are necessary for DNA damage tolerance, they are generally error-prone, and therefore must be highly regulated to prevent unnecessary mutations that can lead to genome instability and tumorigenesis\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Lange et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Sale et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Waters et al., 2009</a>)."

                        "text": "The unique A-family DNA polymerase \u03b8 (Pol\u03b8), encoded by the C-terminal portion of <i>POLQ</i>, tolerates bulky lesions like Y-family polymerases and is therefore also referred to as a translesion polymerase\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Hogg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Seki et al., 2004</a>). However, in contrast to Y-family polymerases, Pol\u03b8 is capable of replicating past the most lethal type of lesion, the double-strand break (DSB)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Chan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Koole et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Mateos-Gomez et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Yousefzadeh et al., 2014</a>). For example, in recent studies we demonstrated the ability of the polymerase domain of <i>POLQ</i>, herein referred to as Pol\u03b8, to perform microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ)\u2014also referred to as alternative end-joining (alt-EJ)\u2014in the absence of any co-factors\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>). MMEJ requires the ability of the polymerase to perform DNA synthesis across a synapse formed between two opposing single-strand DNA (ssDNA) overhangs containing sequence microhomology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>). ssDNA overhangs are formed by partial resection of DSBs via Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN complex) and CtIP, and potentially other factors\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Lee-Theilen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Truong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Zhang and Jasin, 2011</a>). Specifically, Pol\u03b8 was shown to generate MMEJ products by promoting DNA synapse formation of 3\u2019 ssDNA overhangs containing a minimal amount (\u22652 base pairs (bp)) of sequence microhomology, then using the opposing ssDNA overhang as a template <i>in trans</i> to extend the DNA, resulting in stabilization of the end-joining intermediate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>). The polymerase then likely extends the second overhang resulting in gap filling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Ligase III (Lig3) is required to seal the DNA junction formed during alt-EJ/MMEJ\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Audebert et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Simsek et al., 2011</a>), presumably after other enzymes such as endonucleases further process the end-joining intermediate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This end-joining activity appears to be dependent on a unique insertion motif, called insertion loop 2, that also enables Pol\u03b8 to bypass of other types of DNA lesions\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Hogg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>). Thus, although Pol\u03b8 is an A-family polymerase, which normally exhibit high-fidelity DNA synthesis and lack translesion synthesis activity, its unique sequence composition confers end-joining, translesion synthesis, and low-fidelity DNA synthesis activities\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Arana et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hogg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Seki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">2004</a>)."

Intriguingly, these cellular studies showed the presence of both templated and non-templated (random) nucleotide insertions at alt-EJ repair junctions which were dependent on Pol\u03b8\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Chan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Koole et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Mateos-Gomez et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Yousefzadeh et al., 2014</a>). The random insertions were suggested to be due to a putative Pol\u03b8 template-independent activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib19\">Mateos-Gomez et al., 2015</a>). Yet, insofar Pol\u03b8 template-independent terminal transferase activity has not been demonstrated in vitro. For example, early in vitro studies showed the unusual ability of Pol\u03b8 to extend ssDNA and partial ssDNA substrates with 3\u2019 overhangs (pssDNA) by several nucleotides\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Hogg et al., 2012</a>). Although it was suggested that this activity might be the result of template-independent terminal transferase activity, the polymerase failed to extend homopolymeric ssDNA templates, which contain one type of base, without the complementary deoxyribonucleoside-triphosphate (dNTP) present\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Hogg et al., 2012</a>). These previous studies therefore demonstrated a lack of template-independent terminal transferase activity by Pol\u03b8\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Hogg et al., 2012</a>). More recent studies confirmed a lack of template-independent activity by Pol\u03b8\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib33\">Yousefzadeh et al., 2014</a>). Instead, data was presented that suggests Pol\u03b8 extends ssDNA by transiently annealing two oligonucleotides together in an anti-parallel manner, resulting in repeated use of the opposing ssDNA as a template <i>in trans\u00a0</i>(<a href=\"#bib33\">Yousefzadeh et al., 2014</a>). Since cellular studies additionally demonstrated the presence of templated nucleotide insertions at alt-EJ junctions, which were also dependent on expression of the polymerase, models of Pol\u03b8 copying sequences from the opposing overhang were also proposed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Chan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Koole et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Yousefzadeh et al., 2014</a>). This form of templated extension <i>in trans</i> can conceivably facilitate end-joining by generating short regions of microhomology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Although previous biochemical studies suggested the possibility that Pol\u03b8 performs templated extension of ssDNA <i>in trans\u00a0</i>(<a href=\"#bib33\">Yousefzadeh et al., 2014</a>), more recent studies showed that the polymerase extends ssDNA by performing \u2018snap-back\u2019 replication on the same template <i>in cis</i>, similar to other end-joining polymerases\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Brissett et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>)."

Furthermore, whether other factors or co-factors are necessary for activating Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity during alt-EJ, which likely facilitates insertion mutations, remains unknown. Considering that Pol\u03b8 contributes to the survival of breast and ovarian cancer cells deficient in homologous recombination (HR), is associated with a poor clinical outcome for breast cancer patients, and confers resistance to chemotherapy drugs and ionizing radiation, understanding the enzymatic functions of the polymerase is essential for elucidating its roles in cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Ceccaldi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Higgins et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lemee et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Mateos-Gomez et al., 2015</a>)."

Lastly, we further characterized Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity and surprisingly found that this activity is more proficient than terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Together, these data identify an unprecedented switching mechanism employed by Pol\u03b8 to generate genetic diversity during alt-EJ and characterize Pol\u03b8 as among the most proficient terminal transferases in nature."

For example, similar to previous studies\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Hogg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>), we found that Pol\u03b8 fails to extend a homopolymeric ssDNA containing deoxycytidine-monophosphates (poly-dC) in the absence of the complementary deoxyguanosine-triphosphate (dGTP) under standard buffer conditions with magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup><a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This shows that efficient ssDNA extension by Pol\u03b8 requires the complementary nucleotide, which demonstrates that the template bases facilitate the nucleotidyl transferase reactions by pairing with the incoming nucleotide. Our recent studies suggest that this template-dependent activity is due to \u2018snap-back\u2019 replication whereby the polymerase uses the template <i>in cis\u00a0</i>(<a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>). A separate biochemical study also indicated that Pol\u03b8 lacks template-independent activity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib33\">Yousefzadeh et al., 2014</a>). Thus, it remains unclear how Pol\u03b8 facilitates random nucleotide insertions during alt-EJ which contribute to genome instability (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

                                "text": "Considering that divalent cations other than Mg<sup>2+</sup> are present in cells, they may account for the discrepancy between the ability of Pol\u03b8 to perform template-independent DNA synthesis in vivo but not in vitro. We therefore tested various divalent cations in a reaction including Pol\u03b8, poly-dC ssDNA and deoxythymidine-triphosphate (dTTP), in the presence and absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The results showed that Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and to a lesser extent Co<sup>2+</sup>, activates Pol\u03b8 extension of poly-dC with dTTP\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). For example, in the absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, Pol\u03b8 extended only a small fraction of substrates with dTTP (lane 4). In contrast, the addition of Mn<sup>2+</sup> under the same reaction conditions promoted extension of the same substrate by Pol\u03b8 even when Mg<sup>2+</sup> was abundant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Since thymidine cannot base pair with cytidine, these data demonstrate that Mn<sup>2+</sup> activates Pol\u03b8 template-independent terminal transferase activity (i.e. non-templated DNA synthesis). Since Pol\u03b8 DNA synthesis activity is fully supported by Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, lane 25), this indicates that Mn<sup>2+</sup> binds to the same positions as Mg<sup>2+</sup> within the polymerase active site which is necessary for the nucleotidyl transferase reaction. Consistent with this, recent structural studies show that other metals such as calcium can substitute for Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the polymerase active site\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Zahn et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, several lines of evidence show that Mn<sup>2+</sup> can act as a co-factor for DNA polymerases and RNA polymerases and reduces the fidelity of these enzymes\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrade et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dominguez et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Walmacq et al., 2009</a>). Hence, the data show that Mn<sup>2+</sup> acts as a co-factor for Pol\u03b8 which promotes template-independent activity and likely reduces the fidelity of the polymerase. Importantly, this template-independent activity was also stimulated 3\u20138 fold by relatively low concentrations of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (0.2\u2009mM) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (1\u20132\u2009mM) which are found in cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">MacDermott, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Schmitz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Visser et al., 2014</a>). Biochemical studies have also shown that Mn<sup>2+</sup> is a necessary co-factor for the yeast Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) nuclease complex and its mammalian counterpart, MRN, which is essential for generating 3\u2019 overhangs during alt-EJ, presumably by acting with CtIP\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Lee-Theilen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Trujillo et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Zhang and Jasin, 2011</a>). Thus, these and other lines of evidence strongly indicate a physiological role for Mn<sup>2+</sup> as a co-factor for DNA repair enzymes\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrade et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cannavo and Cejka, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dominguez et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Trujillo et al., 1998</a>)."

We further found that Mn<sup>2+</sup> greatly stimulates Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity on non-homopolymeric ssDNA substrates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, left and right). In contrast, in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> Pol\u03b8 became mostly arrested after transferring ~10\u201320 nucleotides (nt), but also generated some larger discrete products (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, left and right). These data along with those presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> indicate that Mg<sup>2+</sup> promotes template-dependent activity which directs the polymerase to repeatedly synthesize a few discrete products as observed for both substrates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, left and right). Consistent with this, we found that Pol\u03b8-Mg<sup>2+</sup> consistently generated similar DNA sequences from the RP347 ssDNA template, which is likely due to snap-back replication (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

As expected, most of the DNA sequence generated by Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> was random and therefore due to template-independent activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This is consistent with the appearance of a smear rather than a few discrete bands as observed with Pol\u03b8-Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>).

In the first and predominant mode, Pol\u03b8 performs template-independent terminal transferase activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, top). In the second mode, Pol\u03b8 performs transient template-dependent extension <i>in cis</i>, also called snap-back replication (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, bottom left). This mechanism accounts for the appearance of complementary sequences within individual extension products (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; grey and colored lines). In the third mode, Pol\u03b8 performs transient template-dependent extension <i>in trans</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, bottom right). This accounts for sequence tracts that are identical or complementary to the initial ssDNA substrate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; black underlines); templated extension <i>in cis</i> can also promote sequence complementary to the initial template (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

We utilized product sequences to specifically trace this enzymatic switching phenomenon at near base resolution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). For example, sequence 8 from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> demonstrates that Pol\u03b8 first performs 50 consecutive random nucleotide transfer events, then switches to a transient snap-back replication mode (templated extension <i>in cis</i>). Next, Pol\u03b8 switches to random mode then after transferring 4 nt switches back to snap-back mode followed by another switch back to random synthesis. Next, Pol\u03b8 switches to the templated extension <i>in trans</i> mode where it copies 7 nt, then switches back to random mode for an additional 23 nt. Finally, Pol\u03b8 switches back to snap-back mode, then after transferring 8 nt it ends the reaction by randomly incorporating an additional 5 nt. Sequence 3 from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> shows similar oscillation between these different mechanisms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, bottom). Here, Pol\u03b8 performs 55 consecutive random nucleotide transfer events then switches to snap-back mode where it incorporates another 15 nt. Since the melting temperature of this 15 bp duplex is predicted to be 50\u00b0C and the reaction was performed at 42\u00b0C, Pol\u03b8 appears to be capable of unwinding duplexes formed during snap-back replication. Pol\u03b8 then performs three additional switching events, ultimately generating in a 138 nt product composed of a combination of random and templated sequence."

Thus, the ratio of Mn<sup>2+</sup> to\u00a0Mg<sup>2+</sup> modulates the balance between these different mechanisms. For example, higher concentrations of Mn<sup>2+</sup> promote template-independent transfer events, whereas lower concentrations of Mn<sup>2+</sup> reduce random transferase activity while increasing template-dependent activity due to snap-back replication (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A and B</a>).

First, we analyzed template- dependent and independent activities in the same reaction performed in solid-phase (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Here, a biotinylated primer-template was immobilized to streptavidin beads, then excess template strand was removed by thorough washing. Primer extension in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> was then performed and extension products were sequenced. The results show that the initial template-dependent activity is performed with relatively high fidelity (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). For example, misincorporation and frameshift error rates of 5.6 x 10<sup>\u20132</sup> and 6.9 x 10<sup>\u20133</sup>, respectively, were observed on this short template. On the other hand, once Pol\u03b8 reaches the end of the template mostly random sequence was generated, demonstrating template-independent activity (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Consistent with this, we show the ability of Pol\u03b8 to continue DNA synthesis far beyond the end of the template exclusively in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). We further show that the rate of misincorporation and mismatch extension by Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> on a primer-template in the presence of a single nucleotide (dATP) is dramatically slower than its activity under identical conditions without the template strand present (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Thus, these data demonstrate that Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> terminal transferase activity is not the result of misincorporation or mismatch extension. As an additional control for template-independent activity, we tested whether Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> performs <i>de novo</i> synthesis in the absence of DNA. Remarkably, Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> exhibits <i>de novo</i> DNA and RNA synthesis which unequivocally demonstrates its ability to synthesize nucleic-acids in a template-independent manner (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

We tested the processivity of Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> on ssDNA by allowing the polymerase to extend the ssDNA for an initial 5\u2009min followed by the addition of a 150-fold excess of unlabeled ssDNA which sequesters the polymerase if it dissociates from the initial radio-labeled ssDNA during the reaction (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). Remarkably, addition of the ssDNA trap had no effect on Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> terminal transferase activity, demonstrating that the polymerase performs ssDNA extension with high processivity.

For example, Pol\u03b8 was first allowed to bind ssDNA immobilized to streptavidin beads. Then, excess unbound Pol\u03b8 was removed by thorough washing of the beads. Next, the reaction was initiated by the addition of dNTPs in buffer containing 10\u2009mM Mn<sup>2+</sup> and 1\u2009mM Mn<sup>2+</sup>. After 15 s, a 150-fold excess of ssDNA trap was added, whereas the negative control reaction contained no trap. Following completion of the reactions, the immobilized ssDNA was isolated and sequenced. Consistent with the results obtained in <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, the ssDNA trap did not suppress Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity. In fact, the data indicate that the addition of excess ssDNA increases the length of ssDNA extension products generated by Pol\u03b8 in solid-phase (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, panels B\u2013D). This suggests that use of a template <i>in trans</i> enables Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity rather than suppressing it. Consistent with this, sequence analysis shows that Pol\u03b8 frequently utilizes the ssDNA trap as a template <i>in trans</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, red underlines, panel D). The polymerase also performs template-independent and snap-back replication activities when the ssDNA trap is present (panel D). Since Pol\u03b8 is highly processive during ssDNA extension (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), these data provide strong support for a model whereby a single polymerase oscillates between the three different modes of teminal transferase activity without dissociating from the initial ssDNA template. Importantly, using intracellular concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (1\u2009mM) and Mn<sup>2+</sup> (50 \u00b5M), Pol\u03b8 remains effective in extending ssDNA and utilizes a combination of templated and non-templated mechanisms during this activity (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>)."

                                "text": "Next, we examined Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity in the context of alt-EJ. Although cellular studies have shown that Pol\u03b8 expression is required for the appearance of non-templated and templated insertions at alt-EJ repair junctions, it remains unknown whether additional factors or co-factors facilitate these insertion events. For example, Pol\u03b8 has been shown to promote what appears to be random nucleotide insertion tracts at alt-EJ repair junctions in mice and flies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Chan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Mateos-Gomez et al., 2015</a>). Evidence in flies, mice and worms also indicates that Pol\u03b8 promotes templated nucleotide insertions, which are proposed to be due to a template copy mechanism <i>in trans</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Chan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Koole et al., 2014</a>). To determine whether Pol\u03b8 is solely responsible for these insertions, and whether the three mechanisms of terminal transferase activity identified herein facilitate these insertions, we reconstituted a minimal alt-EJ system in vitro. Here, two DNA substrates containing a 3\u2019 overhang, herein referred to as partial ssDNA (pssDNA), and a single base pair of microhomology (G:C) at their 3\u2019 termini were incubated with Pol\u03b8, Lig3, ATP, and dNTPs in buffer containing a high ratio of Mg<sup>2+</sup> to Mn<sup>2+</sup> which models cellular conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, top). Although Pol\u03b8 can perform MMEJ without Lig3 by promoting templated extension <i>in trans</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>), the pssDNA substrates in the current assay lack sufficient microhomology for MMEJ, but contain a 5\u2019 phosphate on their short strands which can support ligation of the opposing 3\u2019 overhang that is extended by the polymerase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, top). Control experiments show that the addition of Pol\u03b8 and Lig3 is required for efficient alt-EJ, and that insertions depend on Pol\u03b8 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These results are expected since Lig3 is required for most alt-EJ in cells and therefore likely functions with Pol\u03b8 which facilitates insertions\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Audebert et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Simsek et al., 2011</a>). Following termination of the reaction by EDTA, DNA was purified then end-joining products were amplified by PCR and individually sequenced from cloning vectors (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>)."

Here, Pol\u03b8 dependent alt-EJ in mouse embryonic stem cells promotes translocations between sequence specific DSBs generated in chromosomal DNA by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, as shown in previous studies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, top<a href=\"#bib19\">Mateos-Gomez et al., 2015</a>). To distinguish between the different Pol\u03b8 mediated activities during chromosomal translocation, we carefully analyzed junctions of events resulting from the cleavage of chromosomes 6 and 11, and subsequent formation of Der (6) and (11). Similar to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, we chose to analyze junctions containing insertions &gt;2 bp in length. Remarkably, in the cellular alt-EJ system we also observed insertion tracts that appear to be due to all three modes of Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). For example, similar to the results obtained in the in vitro alt-EJ system (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), cumulative analysis of individual nucleotide insertion events produced in vivo demonstrates that Pol\u03b8 generates a roughly equal proportion of insertion events due to the three different modes of terminal transferase activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). Templated extension <i>in trans</i> accounts for short sequence duplications (black and grey underlines), whereas templated extension <i>in cis</i> (snap-back replication) accounts for the appearance of short complementary sequence tracts (red and blue underlines)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Individual nucleotide insertion events due to non-templated extension appear to be slightly lower in the in vivo system (33.2%) compared to the in vitro system (39%), which is likely due to a lower proportion of Mn<sup>2+</sup> to Mg<sup>2+</sup> in cells. Consistent with this, events due to templated extension <i>in cis</i> (snap-back replication) appear slightly higher in the in vivo system (37.2%) compared to the in vitro system (28.8%). We note that DNA deletions were observed in both systems, albeit more frequently in cells which is likely due to nuclease activity. Deletions in the in vitro system likely result from Pol\u03b8 mediated end-joining at internal sites within the 3\u2019 overhang, as shown previously\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>). This mechanism may also contribute to deletions observed in vivo. Regardless of the specific mechanisms underlying deletion formation in each system, the insertion tracts observed in vitro and in vivo appear similar in nature in regards to template dependency (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4C</a>). Furthermore, the median insertion tract length (7 bp) generated by Pol\u03b8 in vitro and in vivo was identical (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4B</a>). Thus, these data demonstrate that the reconstituted alt-EJ system closely resembles the mechanism of alt-EJ in cells. We note that some large (&gt;30 bp) insertions copied from remote chromosome sites and the CRISPR/Cas9 vector were also observed in the in vivo system (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, these insertions are likely due to a different mechanism such as strand invasion into duplex DNA. Additional analysis of end-joining products generated in vivo demonstrates that Pol\u03b8 preferentially produces insertions &gt;2 bp in length, and occasionally generates relatively long insertions (i.e. &gt;25 bp)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Importantly, sequences of end-joining products generated in vivo support the same mechanism of Pol\u03b8 switching observed in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Altogether, the results presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a> along with previous studies showing the requirement for Pol\u03b8 in forming insertions indicate that Pol\u03b8 is the main enzyme involved in generating insertions during alt-EJ. These results also indicate that Pol\u03b8 oscillates between three different modes of terminal transferase activity to generate insertion mutations, and that Mn<sup>2+</sup> likely acts as a co-factor for Pol\u03b8 in vivo."

For example, we further tested Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> on homopolymeric ssDNA composed of either deoxythymidine-monophosphates (poly-dT) or deoxycytidine-monophosphates (poly-dC), and ssDNA containing variable sequences. The polymerase preferentially extended all of the substrates by more than 100 nt in the presence of deoxyadenosine-triphosphate (dATP), regardless of the sequence context (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Polymerases are known to preferentially incorporate deoxyadenosine-monophosphate (dAMP) when template base coding is not available, which is referred to as the A-rule. For example, polymerases preferentially incorporate a single dAMP opposite an abasic site or at the end of a template. Thus, the observed preferential incorporation of dAMP by Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> is consistent with the A-rule and template-independent activity. Pol\u03b8 also extended ssDNA in the presence of dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, however, the lengths of these products were shorter than with dATP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). For example, in the case of non-homopolymeric ssDNA, Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> transferred ~30\u201370 nt in the presence of dTTP, dCTP, or dGTP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), which demonstrates that Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> terminal transferase activity is relatively efficient even in the absence of the preferred dATP. Notably, the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) X-family polymerase, Pol\u03bc, exhibited minimal terminal transferase activity compared to Pol\u03b8 under identical conditions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Previous studies similarly demonstrated limited terminal transferase activity by Pol\u03bc which is most closely related to TdT\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrade et al., 2009</a>). Thus, to date the data presented insofar indicate that, aside from TdT, Pol\u03b8 possesses the most robust terminal transferase activity for the polymerase enzyme class."

Pol\u03b8 is a unique A-family polymerase since it contains three insertion loops, and previous studies have shown that loop 2 is necessary for Pol\u03b8 extension of ssDNA\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Hogg et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>). The position of this motif is conserved in Pol\u03b8 and is located immediately downstream from a conserved positively charged residue, arginine (R) or lysine (K), at position 2254 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Recent structural studies of Pol\u03b8 in complex with a primer-template and incoming nucleotide show that loop 2 lies relatively close to the 3\u2019 terminus of the primer, but is likely flexible in this conformation due to a lack of resolution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Zahn et al., 2015</a>). Considering that Pol\u03b8 ssDNA extension with Mg<sup>2+</sup> is likely related to its activity with Mn<sup>2+</sup>, we predicted that loop 2 would also confer template-independent terminal transferase activity. Indeed, a loop 2 deletion mutant of Pol\u03b8 (Pol\u03b8L2) failed to extend ssDNA under optimal template-independent terminal transferase conditions with Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Similar to previous results, Pol\u03b8L2 fully extended a primer-template (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Here, Pol\u03b8WT extension continued beyond the template due to the polymerase\u2019s robust terminal transferase activity with Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

Since these positively charged residues are conserved in Pol\u03b8 but not other A-family members (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), we envisaged that they might contribute to Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity. We first tested primer-extension of a double mutant version of Pol\u03b8 in which R2202 and R2254 were changed to alanine (A) and valine (V), respectively (Pol\u03b8RR). Recent studies showed that single R2202A and R2254V Pol\u03b8 mutants were slightly defective in translesion synthesis\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Zahn et al., 2015</a>). Pol\u03b8RR extended the primer in a similar manner to Pol\u03b8WT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Yet, Pol\u03b8RR showed a severe defect in template-independent terminal transferase activity compared to Pol\u03b8WT under identical conditions with Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Since Pol\u03b8WT performs terminal transferase activity with high processivity, we wondered whether Pol\u03b8RR exhibits reduced processivity. Indeed, Pol\u03b8RR showed a significant deficiency in primer extension compared to Pol\u03b8WT when a large excess of DNA was present, confirming a reduction in processivity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). These data also suggest that Pol\u03b8WT exhibits lower processivity during primer-template extension compared to ssDNA extension (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Since Pol\u03b8RR is defective in processivity and template-independent terminal transferase activity, this suggests that the polymerase must be processive on ssDNA to effectively perform template-independent terminal transferase activity. Together, these data identify conserved residues that contribute to Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity by conferring processivity onto the enzyme through binding the 3\u2019 primer terminus."

We therefore examined the ability of Pol\u03b8 to transfer deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides conjugated with different functional groups to the 3\u2019 terminus of ssDNA. Again, using the supplier\u2019s recommended assay conditions for TdT, and identical concentrations of Pol\u03b8 under its optimal conditions, we unexpectedly found that Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> is more effective in transferring ribonucleotides to ssDNA compared to TdT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Although previous studies have shown that Pol\u03b8 strongly discriminates against ribonucleotides\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Hogg et al., 2012</a>), this fidelity mechanism is largely compromised under our conditions used for terminal transferase activity. Again, using the respective optimal conditions for Pol\u03b8 and TdT at identical concentrations, we also found that Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> is more proficient in transferring most modified deoxy-ribonucleotides and ribonucleotides to ssDNA than TdT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). For example, Pol\u03b8 more efficiently transferred eight out of ten modified nucleotides tested. In some cases, Pol\u03b8 produced longer extension products than TdT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). In other cases, Pol\u03b8 transferred nucleotides that TdT was unable to incorporate (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, black boxes). For instance, Pol\u03b8 efficiently transferred a nucleotide containing a linker attached to an azide group which is widely used for \u201cclick chemistry\u201d applications (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, lane 6). In contrast, TdT failed to transfer this nucleotide altogether (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, lane 17). Moreover, TdT failed to transfer nucleotides containing a modified sugar and a linker attached to Texas Red, whereas these substrates were efficiently incorporated by Pol\u03b8 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, nucleotide analogs 4 and 9). These results show that Pol\u03b8 efficiently transfers ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides containing modifications on their base moieties, such as fluorophores and functional groups including biotin and digoxigenin, as well as nucleotides containing sugar modifications (i.e. ganciclovir mono-phosphate). Considering that Pol\u03b8 also exhibits translesion synthesis activity, these results may be attributed to its natural ability to accommodate non-canonical nucleotides in its active site\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Hogg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Yoon et al., 2014</a>)."

In the case of non-templated insertions, it has been proposed that Pol promotes random transfer of nucleotides via a putative template-independent terminal transferase activity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib19\">Mateos-Gomez et al., 2015</a>). Yet, biochemical studies have shown that Pol\u03b8 lacks template-independent terminal transferase activity, creating a paradox between cellular and in vitro data\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Kent et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Yousefzadeh et al., 2014</a>). In the case of templated insertions, a copy <i>in trans</i> model has been proposed which also has not been proven in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Chan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Koole et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Yousefzadeh et al., 2014</a>). In this report, we elucidate how Pol\u03b8 generates both templated and non-templated nucleotide insertion mutations during alt-EJ, and characterize the polymerase as a highly robust terminal transferase for biotechnology and biomedical research applications."

Considering that structural studies show that differential binding of divalent cations within the active site of Pol\u03b8 slightly alters its local conformation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Zahn et al., 2015</a>), Mn<sup>2+</sup> binding likely facilitates an active site conformation more favorable for non-templated DNA synthesis. Since Pol\u03b8 dependent non-templated nucleotide insertions are commonly associated with alt-EJ in cells, our findings suggest that Mn<sup>2+</sup> acts as a co-factor of Pol\u03b8 in vivo. For example, although the concentration of Mn<sup>2+</sup> is relatively low in cells (~0.2 mM) and is considerably less than Mg<sup>2+</sup> (~1.0\u2009mM), we show that these concentrations of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> stimulate Pol\u03b8 template-independent terminal transferase activity by 3\u20138 fold. Thus, cellular concentrations of Mn<sup>2+</sup> are likely to activate Pol\u03b8 template-independent activity. Intriguingly, Mn<sup>2+</sup> has been shown to act as a necessary co-factor for the MRX nuclease complex and its mammalian counterpart, MRN, which is also essential for alt-EJ due to its role in generating 3\u2019 ssDNA overhangs onto which Pol\u03b8 acts\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Cannavo and Cejka, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Trujillo et al., 1998</a>). Thus, various enzymes involved in DNA repair are likely to utilize Mn<sup>2+</sup> as a co-factor in addition to Mg<sup>2+</sup>."

For example, in the presence of ribonucleotides, Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> generated substantially longer extension products, which demonstrates a lower discrimination against ribonucleotides. Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> also produced longer extension products than TdT in the presence of most nucleotide analogs, including those that contain large functional groups. Moreover, Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> efficiently transfered certain nucleotide analags that TdT failed to utilize as substrates. For instance, we found that Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> exclusively transfered a nucleotide conjugated with Texas Red and a nucleotide containing an azide group which is widely used for 'click' chemistry applications. We additionally found that Pol\u03b8-Mn<sup>2+</sup> is capable of transferring canonical and modified nucleotides to RNA, albeit with lower efficiency than DNA. Based on these unexpected findings, we anticipate that Pol\u03b8 will be more useful for modifying nucleic acid substrates for biotechnology, biomedical research and synthetic biology applications. Moreover, since Pol\u03b8 does not require toxic reaction components like TdT, such as Co<sup>2+</sup> salts or salts of cacodylic acid, Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase assays are a safer option for research and biotechnology applications."

                        "text": "Our report raises the question why evolution selected for two robust terminal transferases: Pol\u03b8 and TdT. It is well known that the primary function of TdT is to generate insertion mutations during NHEJ of V, D and J antibody gene regions, which promotes antibody diversity that is necessary for a strong immune system\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Motea and Berdis, 2010</a>). Since a diverse immunological defense is important for survival, a clear selective pressure for TdT existed. In the case of Pol\u03b8, it appears that the polymerase has also been selected to generate insertion mutations during end-joining, however, the evolutionary pressure for this particular mechanism is not as clear. For example, although Pol\u03b8 is essential for alt-EJ, this pathway appears to occur infrequently compared to primary DSB repair processes, such as HR\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib19\">Mateos-Gomez et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Truong et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with this, Pol\u03b8 is not important for normal cell survival or development. Recent studies of <i>C. elegans</i>, however, surprisingly show that Pol\u03b8 mediated alt-EJ is a primary form of repair in germ cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">van Schendel et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, it was shown that Pol\u03b8 mediated alt-EJ promotes a deletion and insertion (indel) signature in propogated laboratory strains that is similar to indels found in natural isolates\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">van Schendel et al., 2015</a>). These studies therefore suggest that Pol\u03b8 is important for generating genetic diversity. Interestingly, human Pol\u03b8 is highly expressed in testis, suggesting the polymerase might also play a role in facilitating genetic diversity in mammals\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib23\">Seki et al., 2003</a>)."

For example, Pol\u03b8 mediated alt-EJ in <i>C. elegans</i> was shown to facilitate replication repair at stable G4 structures which may pose problems for the HR machinery and therefore potentially require an alternative and more accommodating error-pone form of repair\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Koole et al., 2014</a>). Pol\u03b8 has also been shown to suppress large genetic deletions in <i>C. elegans</i>, which demonstrates an obvious benefit for the polymerase\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Koole et al., 2014</a>).

For example, we observed that Pol\u03b8 generates nucleotide insertions during alt-EJ in vitro by spontaneously switching between three distinct modes of terminal transferase activity: non-templated extension, templated extension <i>in cis</i>, and templated extension <i>in trans</i>. Importantly, we show that the characteristics of these insertions are nearly identical to those generated by Pol\u03b8 mediated alt-EJ in cells, which indicates that Pol\u03b8 also switches between these three mechanisms of terminal transferase activity in vivo. To our knowledge, the ability of a polymerase to spontaneously switch between three distinct modes of DNA synthesis has not been demonstrated. Thus, our data reveal an unprecedented set of mechanisms by which a single polymerase can synthesize DNA, presumably for generating genetic diversity and as a last resort for repairing lethal DSBs at the expense of mutations."

Where indicated primer-extension was performed with either a 1:1 ratio of Pol\u03b8WT or Pol\u03b8RR to primer-template (50 nM), or a 1:25 ratio of Pol\u03b8WT or Pol\u03b8RR to primer-template (50 nM). A 150-fold excess of ssDNA trap (7.5 \u00b5M RP316) was added 1\u2009min after initiation of primer-extension where indicated."

Genetic analysis previously showed that pol theta is required for templated and non-tempated insertions at alt-EJ junctions, and this group had previously shown that pol theta could promote DNA synapse formation of 3' ssDNA overhangs containing a minimal amount ({greater than or equal to}2 base pairs (bp)) of sequence microhomology, and then use the opposing ssDNA overhang as a template in trans to extend the DNA. However, the pol \u03b8 dependent, non-templated products were not accounted for by pol \u03b8's in vitro activities. In this paper, Pomerantz and colleagues show that in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, pol \u03b8 exhibits robust, template-independent terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity. It also exhibits two other synthesis modes (template directed synthesis in cis, also called snap-back synthesis, and template extension in trans). By sequencing pol \u03b8 products, they show that single DNA molecules are generated by all three of the above DNA synthesis modes. They also show evidence that similar products exist in vivo. They propose that pol theta binds to DNA ends and then cycles between the three synthesis modes until end joining is achieved. They also characterize the terminal transferase activity of pol theta and show that it is more robust than that of TdT, especially in its ability to add a wide range of bulky nucleotides to DNA ends."

For example, after annealing a 2-fold excess of template to the biotinylated primer to be sure all of the primer is saturated with template strand, we then immobilized the primer-template, then washed away all excess unbound ssDNA template. Next, we added Pol and performed primer extension in solid-phase in the presence of manganese, then sequenced the immobilized extended primer after removing it from the beads by boiling. If the polymerase exhibits extremely low fidelity during primer extension with manganese this would be detected in the sequence. Although we did observe some misicnorporations during primer extension, the rate was 5.6 x 10-2. The rate for frameshift mutations was lower at 6.9 x 10-3. Once the polymerase reached the end of the template, however, the sequence generated was mostly random which strongly indicates a template-independent mechanism and not the result of misincorporation or slippage during a template-dependent mechanism."

Although the reviewers feel that the manuscript strongly implies that \u201cone and the same pol \u03b8 molecule (or dimer) cycles through the different modes of synthesis\u201d, we did not intend to imply this precise mechanism in the language used in the original manuscript. Nevertheless, since the polymerase appears to perform terminal transferase activity in a processive manner, we do agree that the possibility of a single polymerase (or dimers of the polymerase) switching between the three mechanisms without dissociating from the initial substrate is indeed intriguing and a formal possibility. We therefore set out to specifically test this idea as follows. First, we determined what concentration of ssDNA acts as a potent trap of the polymerase in solution in (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). We found that when Pol\u03b8 was added to a combination of 50 nM of radio-labeled ssDNA and a 150-fold excess of unlabeled ssDNA, the polymerase was unable to extend the radio-labeled substrate even after 30 min, which demonstrates that a 150-fold excess of ssDNA acts as a potent trap of the polymerase when it is not pre-bound to DNA. We then used this trap to better assess the processivity of Pol terminal transferase activity in panel B of the same figure (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). Here, Pol\u03b8 ssDNA extension was initiated on the radio-labeled ssDNA, then after 5 min either no trap or a 150-fold excess of cold ssDNA was added and the reaction was allowed to proceed during a time course. Remarkably, addition of the ssDNA trap had no effect Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity, for example the time course in the presence and absence of the trap looked identical. Since the 150-fold excess ssDNA trap effectively sequesters the polymerase from solution in the control experiment in panel A, these data demonstrate that Pol terminal transferase activity is highly processive. Because the polymerase is processive during ssDNA extension and performs three different extension mechanisms during this process, these data imply that one and the same polymerase (or polymerase dimers) cycles through the different activities before dissociating from the initial ssDNA substrate."

Here, Pol\u03b8 terminal transferase activity was performed in solid-phase after excess Pol\u03b8 was removed from solution. For example, after the polymerase was allowed to bind immobilized ssDNA in the absence of dNTPs, the beads were washed extensively to remove excess unbound polymerase. Next the reaction was initiated by the addition of dNTPs in buffer containing magnesium and manganese. Then after 15 seconds, 150-fold excess ssDNA or no trap was added and the reaction was allowed to proceed. After the reaction was terminated, the immobilized extended ssDNA was removed from the beads by boiling then sequenced. Consistent with the results obtained in <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, the polymerase was not inhibited by the addition of the ssDNA trap. In fact, we even observed that excess ssDNA in trans appears to promote further extension of the initial ssDNA substrate by enabling the polymerase to utilize the ssDNA trap as a template in trans. We also observed that under these conditions, where the polymerase is limiting and there is an abundant amount of ssDNA in trans, that Pol readily switches between the three different terminal transferase activities. Together, these new experiments provide strong evidence that the polymerase acts processively during ssDNA extension, and that the polymerase readily switches between the three different terminal transferase activities without dissociating from the initial ssDNA template."

The various data presented in the paper strongly suggest that the mechanism by which Pol\u03b8 extends ssDNA is very different from the mechanism by which the polymerase performs primer extension. For example, although loop 2 is not needed for primer-template extension (shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> and previous work: Kent, T. et al. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. (2015)), this motif is essential for ssDNA extension (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Thus, the processivity of ssDNA extension compared to primer extension is also likely to be different. We therefore included a statement in the text as follows. \u201cThese data also suggest that Pol\u03b8WT exhibits lower processivity during primer-template extension compared to ssDNA extension (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).\u201d"
