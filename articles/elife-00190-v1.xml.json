We identify null mutations in the \u03b1 subunit of AP2 in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. \u03b1-adaptin mutants are viable and the remaining \u03bc2/\u03b2 hemicomplex retains some function. Conversely, in \u03bc2 mutants, the alpha/sigma2 hemicomplex is localized and is partially functional. \u03b1-\u03bc2 double mutants disrupt both halves of the complex and are lethal. The lethality can be rescued by expression of AP2 components in the skin, which allowed us to evaluate the requirement for AP2 subunits at synapses. Mutations in either \u03b1 or \u03bc2 subunits alone reduce the number of synaptic vesicles by about 30%; however, simultaneous loss of both \u03b1 and \u03bc2 subunits leads to a 70% reduction in synaptic vesicles and the presence of large vacuoles. These data suggest that AP2 may function as two partially independent hemicomplexes."

We identify null mutations in the \u03b1 subunit of AP2 in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. \u03b1-adaptin mutants are viable and the remaining \u03bc2/\u03b2 hemicomplex retains some function. Conversely, in \u03bc2 mutants, the alpha/sigma2 hemicomplex is localized and is partially functional. \u03b1-\u03bc2 double mutants disrupt both halves of the complex and are lethal. The lethality can be rescued by expression of AP2 components in the skin, which allowed us to evaluate the requirement for AP2 subunits at synapses. Mutations in either \u03b1 or \u03bc2 subunits alone reduce the number of synaptic vesicles by about 30%; however, simultaneous loss of both \u03b1 and \u03bc2 subunits leads to a 70% reduction in synaptic vesicles and the presence of large vacuoles. These data suggest that AP2 may function as two partially independent hemicomplexes."

Few worms that lacked both subunits survived. Surprisingly, however, worms that lacked just one subunit were viable, despite previous evidence that AP2 requires all four subunits to be functional. Nevertheless, these single mutants produced 30% fewer synaptic vesicles compared to wild-type worms. To examine the consequences of both subunits being absent, Gu et al. rescued the double mutants by selectively expressing AP2 in their skin. These animals\u2014which still lack AP2 in their nervous systems\u2014produced 70% fewer synaptic vesicles than their wild-type counterparts."

Many cargo proteins are recruited to sites of endocytosis by the tetrameric adaptor complex AP2 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mahaffey et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Traub, 2003</a>). The adaptor complex in turn recruits the coat protein clathrin to the membrane. Clathrin converts the raft of cargo and adaptor proteins into a budding vesicle by forming a scaffold that shapes the membrane (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mashl and Bruinsma, 1998</a>). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis probably functions in all tissues, but it is unclear whether this process is suited to the particularly high rates of endocytosis required at nerve terminals. Nonetheless, the predominant mechanism for synaptic vesicle endocytosis is thought to be mediated via AP2 and clathrin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dittman and Ryan, 2009</a>). Testing this model by disrupting clathrin is difficult to interpret because trafficking from the trans-Golgi relies in part on clathrin-coated vesicles. Thus, genetic analysis of AP2 mutants is more specific for endocytic trafficking of proteins from the cell surface."

It is generally thought that adaptor complexes act as obligate tetramers; loss of one subunit will destabilize the entire complex (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dell'Angelica et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kantheti et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Collins et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Motley et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Traub, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nakatsu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mitsunari et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kim and Ryan, 2009</a>). AP2 functions at the plasma membrane as an interaction hub for transmembrane cargoes, accessory proteins, and clathrin (<a href=\"#bib56\">Traub, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Robinson, 2004</a>). Loss of single AP2 subunits is known to disrupt endocytosis at the plasma membrane. A null allele in \u03b1-adaptin is lethal and leads to an absence of synaptic vesicles at neuromuscular junctions in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos and thus appears to disrupt endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gonzalez-Gaitan and Jackle, 1997</a>). Similarly, in <i>C. elegans</i> loss of either of \u03b1- or \u03b2-adaptin by RNA interference perturbs the endocytosis of yolk protein from the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grant and Hirsh, 1999</a>).

Although \u03bc2 is required in part for the localization of clathrin at synapses (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gu et al., 2008</a>), synaptic vesicles and constituent proteins are still recycled in the absence of \u03bc2 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kim and Ryan, 2009</a>).

Mutants lacking \u03b1-adaptin retain a partially functional AP2 hemicomplex consisting of \u03bc2 and \u03b2-adaptin. Mutants lacking both \u03b1 and \u03bc2 subunits exhibit a more severe phenotype than the single mutants and are subviable. These results suggest that the single subunits retain some function, but that the double mutants lack all AP2 function. Nevertheless a moderate level of synaptic transmission remains in the double mutant and is able to sustain locomotory behavior, suggesting the presence of an AP2 independent mechanism capable of maintaining synaptic transmission at the synapse."

Yolk is a lipoprotein particle composed of lipids and lipid-transport proteins called vitellogenins. Yolk particles are synthesized and secreted by the intestine and are then taken up from the extracellular space by maturing oocytes via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Yolk endocytosis is clathrin-dependent and can be assayed in animals expressing GFP-tagged vitellogenin-2 (YP170::GFP) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grant and Hirsh, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sato et al., 2009</a>). In wild-type worms, YP170::GFP is enriched in the three most mature oocytes near the spermatheca. In \u03b1-adaptin mutants, the number of GFP-positive oocytes is decreased to one or two cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), which is similar to the defect in \u03bc2 mutants (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gu et al., 2008</a>). By contrast, strong defects in YP170::GFP endocytosis are observed in mutants lacking the alternative clathrin adaptor Disabled (<a href=\"#bib20\">Holmes et al., 2007</a>). Thus, the AP2 complex appears to assist Disabled for yolk endocytosis, and \u03b1- and \u03bc2-adaptin do not contribute differentially to this process. To determine if \u03b1- and \u03bc2-adaptin contribute differentially to endocytosis, we needed to identify specific cargo."

We constructed an artificial cargo protein known to bind \u03b1-adaptin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We tagged the human CD4 protein with GFP, and appended the di-leucine motif (ExxxLL) from HIV Nef to the carboxy terminus (<a href=\"#bib6\">Doray et al., 2007</a>). We expressed the construct in the intestine. In wild-type worms CD4-dileucine is localized to intracellular compartments; however, in <i>apa-2</i> mutants CD4-dileucine accumulates abnormally on basolateral membranes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). By contrast in <i>apm-2</i> mutants, the CD4-dileucine accumulation on the plasma membrane is milder (69% compared to \u03b1 mutants; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>).

Second, due to the low viability of the double mutant, it is impossible to maintain as a homozygous strain.

For example in AP180 mutants, synaptobrevin is no longer concentrated at synapses but is diffuse in axons (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nonet et al., 1999</a>). By contrast, in AP2 adaptin mutants, synaptic vesicle proteins are not grossly mislocalized. Synaptotagmin, the vesicular GABA transporter (UNC-47), and synaptogyrin are largely confined to synaptic varicosities in \u03b1-adaptin single mutants and \u03b1-\u03bc2 adaptin double mutants, although the GFP signal is slightly diffuse in axons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). These data are consistent with previous data demonstrating that the relevant adaptors for synaptotagmin and the GABA transporter are Stonin and BAD-LAMP/UNC-46, respectively (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schuske et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Maritzen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mullen et al., 2012</a>).

The mini amplitudes in the skin-rescued single and double mutants are also larger, although they do not reach statistical significance. The enhanced mini amplitude could have been caused by an increase in postsynaptic receptor density due to a defect in receptor endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kittler et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kastning et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Vithlani and Moss, 2009</a>).

The results indicate that AP2 can function as two hemicomplexes comprised of either the \u03b1/\u03c3 subunits or \u03bc/\u03b2 subunits. The evidence for hemicomplexes is the following: First, in \u03b1-adaptin mutants, the \u03bc2-\u03b2 subunits are stable, but the small \u03c32 subunit is unstable. Second, in \u03bc2-adaptin mutants, \u03b1-\u03c32 subunits are stable, but the \u03b2 subunits are unstable. Third, specific cargoes require the cognate hemicomplex for endocytosis. Fourth, the subunits contribute genetically independent functions to viability, body morphology and synaptic vesicle biogenesis. Although our data suggest that AP2 hemicomplexes can function in <i>C. elegans</i>, it must be emphasized that they are not fully independent; each hemicomplex is less stable in the absence of the other.

Previous trypsin-sensitivity experiments suggested that AP2 undergoes a conformational change between the cytosolic and clathrin-bound states (<a href=\"#bib35\">Matsui and Kirchhausen, 1990</a>). The crystal structures of both the closed and open conformations have been solved (<a href=\"#bib3\">Collins et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>). In the open state, \u03bc2-adaptin is postulated to undergo a large-scale conformational change; this rearrangement brings the four PIP2 binding sites and two endocytic motif binding sites of AP2 into a single plane. In this open conformation, the interactions between the C-terminal \u03bc2 domain and \u03b1 and \u03c32 are lost, and the binding surface between the C-terminal domain of \u03bc2 and \u03b2 is doubled (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>). This implies that upon cargo binding, the interaction between \u03bc2 and \u03b2 is strengthened while the contacts with the other half of the complex are weakened. It is possible that upon cargo binding the AP2 complex becomes two loosely connected hemi-complexes."

                        "text": "What is the functional relationship between the hemicomplexes? There are three possibilities: inseparable functions, separable functions, and redundant functions. First, some functions seem to require both hemi-complexes combined, and it is surprising that loss of one hemicomplex does not eliminate all AP2 function. For example, recruitment of AP2 to membranes in vitro requires both PIP2 binding sites on \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>). On the other hand, PIP2 binding sites on each of the hemicomplexes may be sufficient for membrane association albeit with a lowered avidity. Second, other AP2 functions may be uniquely provided by each hemicomplex. Substrate binding in some cases is subunit-specific and loss of one hemicomplex preferentially affects a cargo protein, for example, MIG-14 is not recruited in a \u03bc2 adaptin mutant. On the cytoplasmic side, the ear of the alpha subunit preferentially binds particular ancillary proteins like amphiphysin, synaptojanin, Numb, and stonin2 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Owen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Santolini et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Praefcke et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jung et al., 2007</a>), whereas clathrin heavy chain binds the appendage of \u03b2 strongly and only binds the \u03b1 appendage weakly (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shih et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Owen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schmid et al., 2006</a>). Thus, loss of a single hemicomplex will result in the loss of only a specific subset of AP2 functions. Third, some functions might be mediated by either subunit, and only a double mutant would lead to a severe phenotype. For example, the appendage domains of both large subunits bind some of the same proteins, for example AP180, epsin, and eps15 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Owen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mishra et al., 2004</a>). Importantly, redundancy need not act only at the level of AP2 subunits but could be contained within the network of associated proteins. Although clathrin is largely recruited to AP2 by the \u03b2 subunit, even in the absence of \u03b2, it could still be recruited indirectly to the complex via AP180\u2014the web of interactions within the clathrin complex generates a redundant network (<a href=\"#bib49\">Royle, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schmid et al., 2006</a>). Thus, in contrast to un-networked hubs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jeong et al., 2001</a>), the loss of the hub does not cause things to fall apart; the center can hold."

It is also possible that the ability of AP2 hemicomplexes to function is also conserved. A purified human \u03b1-\u03c32 hemicomplex can bind di-leucine motifs, suggesting that hemicomplexes can be stable and exhibit appropriate biochemical interactions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Doray et al., 2007</a>). Although double mutants have not been analyzed in other metazoans, a genome-wide genetic interaction analysis in <i>S. pombe</i> found that mutations in AP2 \u03b22 and \u03c32 exhibited synthetic interactions in double mutants (<a href=\"#bib11\">Frost et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that functional hemicomplexes may be conserved in other organisms. On the other hand, knocking down the \u03bc2 subunit in cultured hippocampal neurons caused a concomitant 96% reduction of \u03b1-adaptin suggesting that hemicomplexins are not stable in these cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim and Ryan 2009</a>).

A reduction of synaptic vesicle numbers by 70% and the accumulation of large vesicles imply an important role of AP2 in endocytosis. These defects resemble those observed in synaptotagmin mutants in <i>C. elegans</i> or after acute disruption of synaptotagmin in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jorgensen et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Poskanzer et al., 2006</a>). Moreover, the synaptic phenotypes of mutants lacking stonin are similar (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fergestad et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mullen et al., 2012</a>). One possibility is that AP2 nucleates synaptic vesicle endocytosis with stonin and synaptotagmin. The synaptotagmin C2B domain binds AP2 via the mu-homology domain of \u03bc2-adaptin (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Haucke et al., 2000</a>), and the C2A domain binds the mu-homology domain of stonin (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jung et al., 2007</a>). It is possible that these proteins work together in a single process. In fact analysis of double mutants suggest that stonin and AP2 act in a similar process (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mullen et al., 2012</a>). In the simplest model, synaptotagmin recruits stonin and AP2 to the plasma membrane to recover synaptic vesicle components."

One is forced to conclude that despite an important role in endocytosis, that synaptic vesicles are still being generated in the absence of AP2. What process contributes to synaptic vesicle endocytosis when AP2 is missing? One possibility is that AP1 or AP3 could compensate for the loss of AP2. In the mouse, there is evidence that AP1could function at the synapse and substitute for AP2 in its absence (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim and Ryan, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Glyvuk et al., 2010</a>). Alternatively AP3 might be able to provide function in the absence of AP2 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Blumstein et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Voglmaier et al., 2006</a>). However, AP1 and AP3 are not likely to be recycling vesicles from the membrane at the <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular junctions. First, the presence of \u03b2-adaptin (shared by AP1) in the nerve ring is completely dependent upon the presence of \u03bc2; AP1 does not seem to be at the synapse (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

The data presented here do not contradict those studies, but also suggest that synaptic vesicle proteins and membrane can be recovered from the membrane despite a loss of AP2. The most prominent defect observed in AP2 mutants is the presence of large diameter vesicles and vacuoles in the synapses of the \u03b1-\u03bc2 adaptin double mutants. In some cases these vacuoles appear to be attached to the plasma membrane at the adherens junctions (<a href=\"#fig8s4\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), suggesting a defect in the formation and cleavage of vesicles from the plasma membrane. In other cases, reconstructions of these vacuoles from serial electron micrographs indicate that they are separated from the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>).

To briefly summarize, 10 young adult hermaphrodites were placed into a freezing cup (100 \u00b5m well of type A specimen carrier) containing space-filling bacteria, covered with a type B specimen carrier flat side down, and frozen instantaneously in the BAL-TEC HPM 010 (BAL-TEC, Liechtenstein). The frozen animals were fixed in the Leica AFS device with 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.1% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone for 2 days at \u221290\u00b0C and for 38.9 more hr with a gradual increase in temperature (5 \u00b0C/hr to \u221220\u00b0C over 14 hr, constant temperature at \u221220\u00b0C for 16 hr, and 10 \u00b0C/hr to 20\u00b0C over 4 hr). The fixed animals were embedded in epon-araldite resin following the infiltration series (30% epon-araldite/acetone for 4 hr, 70% epon-araldite/acetone for 5 hr, 90% epon-araldite/acetone overnight, and pure epon-araldite for 8 hr). Mutant and control blocks were blinded. Ribbons of ultra-thin (33 nm) serial sections were collected using an Ultracut six microtome at the level of the anterior reflex of the gonad. Images were obtained on a Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope using a Gatan digital camera. Two hundred and fifty ultra-thin, contiguous sections were cut, and the ventral nerve cord was reconstructed from two animals representing each genotype. Image analysis was performed using Image J software. The numbers of synaptic vesicles (\u223c30 nm), dense-core vesicles (\u223c40 nm) and large vesicles (&gt;40 nm) in each synapse were counted. Their distances from the presynaptic specialization and the plasma membrane, as well as their diameters, were measured in acetylcholine neurons VA and VB and the GABA neuron VD. A synapse \u2018profile' is defined as a single section that passes through the dense projection at a neuromuscular junction. Profiles are used for quantifying synaptic vesicle numbers at synapses (in fact, it uses a section that passes through the middle of the synapse as a representative section of the synapse). A \u2018synapse' encompasses adjacent serial sections containing a dense projection (usually four sections). Sections on either side of that density were also included if they contained synaptic vesicle numbers above the average number of synaptic vesicles per profile. \u2018Synapse' reconstructions are used for quantifying the presence of large vesicles or vacuoles associated with the dense projection; since there is usually only one such structure per synapse, partial reconstructions of the synapse are required to reliably identify these structures. Two-tailed Student's <i>t</i>-test was used for vesicle numbers and Mann-Whitney U test was used for vesicle diameters."

Postsynaptic currents (mPSCs and ePSCs) at the NMJ were recorded as previously described (<a href=\"#bib47\">Richmond et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2007</a>). To recapitulate, an animal was immobilized on a sylgard-coated glass coverslip by applying a cyanoacrylate adhesive along the dorsal side. A longitudinal incision was made in the dorsolateral region. After clearing the viscera, the cuticle flap was folded back and glued to the coverslip, exposing the ventral nerve cord and two adjacent muscle quadrants. A Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with a 40\u00d7 water immersion lens and 15\u00d7 eyepieces were used for viewing the preparation. Borosilicate glass pipettes with a tip resistance of 3\u20135 M\u03a9 were used as electrodes for voltage clamping. The classical whole-cell configuration was obtained by rupturing the patch membrane of a gigaohm seal formed between the recording electrode and a body wall muscle cell. The cell was voltage-clamped at \u201360 mV to record mPSCs and ePSCs. ePSCs were evoked by applying a 0.5 ms square wave current pulse at a supramaximal voltage (25 V) through a stimulation electrode placed in close apposition to the ventral nerve cord. Postsynaptic currents were amplified with a Heka EP10 amplifier (InstruTECH) and acquired with Patchmaster software (HEKA). Data were sampled at a rate of 10 kHz after filtering at 2 kHz.

An experiment would be to test cargos that are solely trafficked by either hemi-complex. This could be done using chimeric CD4 proteins containing either di-leucine (as in Figure 4) or tyrosine-based endocytic motifs (which mediate binding to alpha2 and mu2 respectively). If hemi-complexes function independently, di-leucine substrate recycling would be disrupted in apa-2 (as indicated in Figure 4D) but unaffected in apm-2 (which was not tested). The converse pattern would be expected for cargos containing a tyrosine endocytic motif. In principle, these experiments could persuasively show that in mutants lacking specific subunits, the remaining AP2 subunits have the capacity to function as hemi-complexes."

For example, AP2 binding to cargo endocytic motifs is activated by PIP2 binding, which is mediated by residues in both hemi-complexes. Clathrin recruitment by AP2 is mediated by clathrin binding sequences in both hemi-complexes. Native cargoes may contain motifs that bind both alpha and mu subunits. For these reasons, the avidity of the AP2 holo-complex for substrates and clathrin may be much stronger than for either hemi-complex. In addition, the authors should comment on the observation that protein abundance for the residual hemi-complex is relatively low (e.g., in the <i>apm-2</i> mutants), suggesting that it would be a minor contributor to wild-type endocytic activity. This is particularly the case if recruitment to the membrane is compromised for the hemi-complex."

An experiment would be to test cargos that are solely trafficked by either hemi-complex. This could be done using chimeric CD4 proteins containing either di-leucine (as in Figure 4) or tyrosine-based endocytic motifs (which mediate binding to alpha2 and mu2 respectively). If hemi-complexes function independently, di-leucine substrate recycling would be disrupted in apa-2 (as indicated in Figure 4D) but unaffected in apm-2 (which was not tested). The converse pattern would be expected for cargos containing a tyrosine endocytic motif. In principle, these experiments could persuasively show that in mutants lacking specific subunits, the remaining AP2 subunits have the capacity to function as hemi-complexes</i>."

Consistent with the model, the substrate was strongly mislocalized in the <i>apa-2</i> \u03b1 mutant, and weakly mislocalized in the <i>apm-2</i> \u03bc2 mutant. Images are shown in Figure 5D and the quantification is shown in Figure 5E. For a \u03bc2 substrate, we used MIG-14 / wntless, which we have previously shown requires \u03bc2 for endocytosis from the surface. In reciprocal experiments we found that MIG-14 endocytosis is more defective in \u03bc2 mutants than \u03b1 mutants. Images are in Figure 5F and quantification in Figure 5G."

For example, AP2 binding to cargo endocytic motifs is activated by PIP2 binding, which is mediated by residues in both hemi-complexes. Clathrin recruitment by AP2 is mediated by clathrin binding sequences in both hemi-complexes. Native cargoes may contain motifs that bind both alpha and mu subunits. For these reasons, the avidity of the AP2 holo-complex for substrates and clathrin may be much stronger than for either hemi-complex. In addition, the authors should comment on the observation that protein abundance for the residual hemi-complex is relatively low (e.g., in the apm-2 mutants), suggesting that it would be a minor contributor to wild-type endocytic activity. This is particularly the case if recruitment to the membrane is compromised for the hemi-complex</i>."
