Here we used rapid, reversible optogenetic inhibition to test the role of cortex during a head-fixed task in which mice reach, grab, and eat a food pellet. Sudden cortical inhibition blocked initiation or froze execution of this skilled prehension behavior, but left untrained forelimb movements unaffected. Unexpectedly, kinematically normal prehension occurred immediately after cortical inhibition, even during rest periods lacking cue and pellet. This \u2018rebound\u2019 prehension was only evoked in trained and food-deprived animals, suggesting that a motivation-gated motor engram sufficient to evoke prehension is activated at inhibition\u2019s end. These results demonstrate the necessity and sufficiency of cortical activity for enacting a learned skill."

Here we used rapid, reversible optogenetic inhibition to test the role of cortex during a head-fixed task in which mice reach, grab, and eat a food pellet. Sudden cortical inhibition blocked initiation or froze execution of this skilled prehension behavior, but left untrained forelimb movements unaffected. Unexpectedly, kinematically normal prehension occurred immediately after cortical inhibition, even during rest periods lacking cue and pellet. This \u2018rebound\u2019 prehension was only evoked in trained and food-deprived animals, suggesting that a motivation-gated motor engram sufficient to evoke prehension is activated at inhibition\u2019s end. These results demonstrate the necessity and sufficiency of cortical activity for enacting a learned skill."

For example, picking up an object involves several steps that must be precisely controlled, including reaching towards the item and holding it using the right amount of pressure to not crush it or drop it. Part of the brain called the motor cortex is thought to be important for learning and controlling these skilled movements, but its exact role in these processes is not clear."

Motor control is achieved by the coordinated activity of myriad neural structures, including the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Neurophysiological recordings, inactivation experiments, and stimulation studies have been used to describe the role of cortex in motor control. Cortical neurons display dynamic activity patterns during movement planning and execution, but their functional contribution to skilled action cannot be assessed from recordings alone (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lemon, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Scott, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Evarts, 2011</a>). Previous inactivation experiments have suggested the cortex tunes\u2014rather than initiates and executes\u2014motor programs to achieve dexterous movement (<a href=\"#bib33\">Walker and Fulton, 1938</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lawrence and Kuypers, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Castro, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Passingham et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Martin and Ghez, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Whishaw, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fogassi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Peters et al., 2014</a>). The classical perturbation methods used in these studies lack temporal specificity and allow for the emergence of compensatory mechanisms (but see supplement of <a href=\"#bib27\">Peters et al., 2014</a>). Electrical stimulation of cortex has been shown to be sufficient to elicit complex movements, but it remains difficult to resolve if evoked behaviors are caused by direct cortical neuron stimulation or antidromic activation of inputs to cortex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ferrier, 1873</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Penfield, 1954</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gottlieb et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Graziano et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ramanathan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Harrison et al., 2012</a>). Thus the precise role of cortex in skilled movement remains unclear. Here we inhibited cortex with an optogenetic method that minimizes compensation, and selective stimulation of cortical neurons was achieved by the cessation of inhibition."

This prehension behavior was broken down into six sequential epochs (Lift, Hand open, Grab, Supinate, At mouth, and Chew; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>) that divide the complex movement into components that involve distinct muscle activations. Unlike previous paradigms, our task employed head fixation to reduce postural variability, allow examination of reaction time, and enable future physiological investigations (<a href=\"#bib36\">Whishaw et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Osborne and Dudman, 2014</a>). All animals that underwent training learned the task. Reaching for the pellet could be achieved in 5\u201310 sessions and stable performance (median success rate was 74%, n\u00a0=\u00a013 animals) could be realized in approximately 15 sessions. We used high-speed video and machine-learning-based tracking to semi-automatically convert filmed movements into hand trajectories (see Materials and methods, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and E</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Stereotypy of head-fixed prehension can be seen in sequential trajectories from a single animal during a behavioral session (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

To avoid this confound, we employed rapid onset, within-trial suppression by light-activating channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-expressing inhibitory neurons (expressing the vesicular GABA transporter [<i>Slc32a1</i>]) in cortex with pulses of light (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guo et al., 2014</a>). This method presumes that activation of <i>Slc32a1-</i>COP4*H134R/EYFP-positive neurons selectively suppresses cortex, although other possibilities do exist (for evidence against, see methods). Cortical inhibition was limited in space (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and time by regulating the position and duration of light exposure. To limit compensation, light was delivered on less than 20% of trials during a behavioral session. We first applied inhibition at cue onset to test the role of cortex for behavior initiation. The only effective area of cortical suppression was centered over contralateral forelimb motor cortex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Because forelimb motor and sensory cortices are overlapping at this resolution in the rodent, we will refer to this region as sensorimotor (SM) cortex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ayling et al., 2009</a>)."

Prehension reliably occurred after optogenetic cortical suppression was relinquished (initiation in 436 of 467 trials, n\u00a0=\u00a08 animals), <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Inhibition of other cortical areas did not affect behavioral initiation rates (ipsilateral sensorimotor (initiation in 124 of 124 trials, n\u00a0=\u00a03 animals, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), visual (initiation in 122 of 124 trials, n\u00a0=\u00a03 animals, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), and frontal (initiation in 124 of 124 trials, n\u00a0=\u00a03 animals, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) cortex). In contrast to prehension, voluntary grooming was not impacted by sensorimotor cortical suppression (11/11 trials, n\u00a0=\u00a04 animals, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). To rule out that initiation failure was due to an inability to process the cue, we activated cortical inhibitory neurons during a cued licking task in which a pellet of food positioned close to the mouth was captured by the tongue; this behavior was not affected by sensorimotor inhibition (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Videos 6</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">7</a>). During this cued licking task, animals sometimes moved their forelimb from the perch to their mouth/table (2/3 animals, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). While these movements shared some features with the trained prehension behavior, they were not kinematically stereotyped. Contralateral sensorimotor cortical suppression did not prevent these forelimb movements during cued licking (forelimb movement in 44/44 control trials and 20/20 laser trials for two animals, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). These results indicate that contralateral sensorimotor cortex activity is necessary for initiation of a learned, goal-directed, skilled prehension behavior."

Sensorimotor cortical suppression during the Lift, Hand open, Grab, and Supination components of the movement resulted in a \u201cfreezing\u201d of progression towards the target, after a short latency (5/5 animals; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#media8\">Videos 8</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">9</a>, <a href=\"#media10\">10</a>, <a href=\"#media12\">12</a> and <a href=\"#media16\">16</a>). The latency to freezing (between 72\u2013170 ms for a representative animal) implies that this is the timescale over which the cortex commands specific components of the movement (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A4\u2013D4</a>). Movement during the delay was not simply the result of momentum, since in many cases the movement progressed to the next distinct component before freezing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A3\u2013E4</a>). Cortical suppression was not effective at impeding hand movements involved in chewing, suggesting these motor programs do not require sensorimotor cortex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a>, <a href=\"#media11\">Videos 11</a> and <a href=\"#media13\">13</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media15\">15</a>), despite involving similar muscle groups. Prolonged suppression of sensorimotor cortex during freezing resulted in a retraction of the limb either to the perch or a characteristic midair position (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A2\u2013E2</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Videos 8</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">9</a>, <a href=\"#media10\">10</a> and <a href=\"#media12\">12</a>).

An involuntary nature of rebound prehension was supported by its occurrence even on cued trials when the animal had already grabbed the pellet (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#media10\">Videos 10</a>, <a href=\"#media12\">12</a> and <a href=\"#media16\">16</a>). To further test this, we removed both the pellet and the cue to disengage the animal from the task. During these uncued experiments, the\u00a0animals remained motionless during contralateral sensorimotor cortical inhibition as expected. Surprisingly, immediately (~250 ms) following light cessation, the\u00a0animals reached and grabbed at the empty pellet tray (initiation in 192/224 trials, n\u00a0=\u00a08 animals, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <a href=\"#media17\">Videos 17</a>). Rebound execution did not occur in untrained animals (3/3 animals) and was specific to prehension; no other type of movement was generated following light termination (n\u00a0=\u00a01434 trials, n\u00a0=\u00a05 animals). If a pellet was in the target position but the animal was not alerted of its presence, cessation of inhibition frequently generated the full reach-grab-eat sequence (<a href=\"#media18\">Videos 18</a>). Taken together, these observations indicate that rebound prehension is not the result of ongoing sensory information or the animals\u2019 remembered behavioral state. Rather, termination of inhibitory neuron activation in sensorimotor cortex, in combination with plastic changes induced by training, is sufficient to evoke a complex, learned motor act."

Anatomically, no area outside of sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the utilized limb was effective in evoking the behavior in the no cue/no\u00a0pellet condition (ipsilateral sensorimotor, 0/68 trials, n\u00a0=\u00a03 animals, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>; frontal, 0/20 trials, n\u00a0=\u00a02 animals; visual, 0/21 trials, n\u00a0=\u00a03 animals). Duration of cortical inhibition was also a critical factor in initiating rebound prehension. At least 2\u00a0s (median across animals) of cortical inhibition was required to achieve rebound prehension rates above 90% (n\u00a0=\u00a04 animals, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Longer durations (4\u00a0s was longest tested) of cortical inhibition also reduced the latency variability of prehension initiation (n\u00a0=\u00a02 animals, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Interestingly, long durations of photostimulation (2 s or more) were specifically associated with prominent rebound spiking in cortical neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This raises the possibility that rebound spiking in the cortex is responsible for rebound prehension. Rebound prehension itself is also cortically dependent, as reactivation of sensorimotor inhibitory cortical neurons freezes progression of the rebound movement (<a href=\"#media19\">Videos 19</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The\u00a0presence of food in the mouth decreased rebound prehension rates (18/95 trials exhibited rebound; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>; <a href=\"#media11\">Videos 11</a>, <a href=\"#media13\">13</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media15\">15</a>). For nearly all of these (93/95) trials, animals were still chewing at light termination. To distinguish whether the reduced rate of rebound prehension was related to motor-program competition (chewing versus prehension) or to motivation (due to consumption of the pellet), we assayed rebound rates for failure trials where animals were chewing without the pellet (29/256 trials, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Prehension generally occurred (21/29 trials) if the light was terminated during pelletless chewing. To further test the role of hunger/satiety, we terminated food deprivation; animals on free food for one day exhibited significantly reduced rates of rebound prehension despite still engaging in the control version of the behavior (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). These results suggest that motivational drive, operating along both short (eating) and long (sated) time scales, gates rebound prehension. Therefore, evocation of the learned behavior depends not only on features of the inhibition but also on the satiety of the animal."

Contrary to the view that cortex is only involved in achieving dexterity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kawai et al., 2015</a>), we found cortex to be necessary for initiating and executing the dexterous\u00a0and\u00a0non-dexterous steps of this skilled movement. The necessity of cortex for initiation and execution is consistent with some interpretations of experiments where cortical stimulation delayed or interrupted voluntary movements in primates (<a href=\"#bib25\">Penfield and Jasper, 1954</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Day et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lemon et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Churchland and Shenoy, 2007</a>). Apparent disagreements between our work and that described by Kawai et al. may be due to differences in the behavior and/or the perturbation methodology. The forelimb-lever press task in the study by Kawai et al. requires animals to learn a time interval but not the precise spatial position of an external target. In contrast, the prehension behavior studied here requires the animal to learn the position of the pellet and how to precisely execute a reach to that location. This difference suggests that cortex is not required for interval tasks but rather skilled interactions with objects in the environment. An outlier animal described by Kawai et al. provides support for this hypothesis; this animal was unique in that it made precise movements to the lever and showed a significant decrease in performance after cortical perturbation. Additionally, the two experiments also differ in the acuteness of the cortical manipulations; we used rapid onset optogenetic inhibition while Kawai et al. utilized pharmacological and surgical manipulations. The rapidity of optogenetic inhibition may impede compensation mechanisms that ameliorate resulting phenotypes."

                        "text": "We found that termination of inhibitory neuron activation in sensorimotor cortex suffices to drive a full action sequence to the learned target. Previous activation studies of cortex have shown that electrical (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ferrier, 1873</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Penfield, 1954</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gottlieb et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Graziano et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ramanathan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bonazzi et al., 2013</a>) and optogenetic (<a href=\"#bib15\">Harrison et al., 2012</a>) stimulation for behaviorally relevant durations produces motor sequences. Rebound prehension differs from these movements in three ways: rebound prehension is a coordinated sequence of movements (reaching, grabbing, and eating) accurately directed to an external goal regardless of starting position, depends on training, and is gated by motivation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ramanathan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Harrison et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bonazzi et al., 2013</a>). These differences suggest that termination of inhibition evokes a motor engram specifying a learned goal/end-point of a trained behavior (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bernstein, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</a>). Cortical synapses modified during the learning of skilled actions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Rioult-Pedotti et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Xu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Wang et al., 2011</a>) may be responsible for the formation of these motor engrams. Alternatively, the engram could be stored elsewhere, and relief of cortical inhibition could trigger or permit its activation in a downstream network. The ability to specifically elicit a post-manipulation transition of cortical state from quiescence to motor engram activation should enable functional characterization of the neural programs responsible for enacting skilled multi-step behavior."

This apparatus was placed in a light\u00a0tight, ventilated, soundproof 28-inch cubic behavioral box. A near-infrared-sensitive webcam was used to monitor animals. Mice were initially trained for approximately 30\u2009min per day, until they started licking pellets (10 or 20 mg; Test Diet; St Louis, MO) placed directly below their mouth. Food pellets arrived ~\u00a0200\u00a0ms\u00a0after the start of an auditory tone (5 kHz) by rotating the turntable with a servomotor driven by custom-programmed Arduino software. Mice were initially (1\u20135 training sessions) trained to retrieve a food pellet by licking and eating the pellet, often using their hand to guide the pellet into their mouth. After cued licking was learned, the turntable was moved progressively further away (over 3\u201310 sessions) to encourage mice to reach for the pellet after the cue. After mastering the task (approximately 15 sessions), turntable placement was reproduced daily for each animal by aligning live images to a reference image. Inter-trial intervals ranged from 20\u2009s to 1\u2009min and approximately 50 trials were collected per day. Mice almost always started with hands on perch and trials where animals lifted the hand before the cue were discarded. Mice were trained each day for approximately 60\u2009min until they routinely responded to the auditory cue (within 1\u2009s) and grabbed the pellet. Reprieve of food deprivation was accomplished by administering food ad libitum for one day, prehension rates were tested, and then animals were returned to previous food deprivation conditions."

Fibers were positioned on or above (1\u20132 mm) the skull at stereotactic coordinates for different cortical regions (cM1: 0.5 mm anterior to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral of midline; iM1: 0.5 mm anterior to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral of midline; V1: 4.0 mm posterior to bregma, 3.0 mm lateral of midline; FrC: 3.1 mm anterior to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral of midline). 40\u2009Hz sinusoidal stimulation with average power of 1\u201315 mW at the fiber\u2019s end was delivered for 0.1\u20134\u2009s, and power was reduced to 0 mW over the final 100 ms of stimulation. The approximate diameter of the light spot on the skull/window surface was 400 \u03bcm. Laser power of 10\u201315 mW has been shown to silence spike rates by 90% within 1.5 mm of the center of the laser spot (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guo et al., 2014</a>). We found no significant differences between prehension evoked with 2\u20134\u2009s laser pulses, so they were grouped. To compensate for potential confounds of visible blue light during optogenetic stimulation, the behavioral box was illuminated with a blue LED throughout training and testing. During testing, trials with optogenetic perturbation were interleaved with control trials without laser stimulation (&lt; 20% laser trials, randomly interspersed)."

                                "text": "Optogenetic activation of cortical inhibitory neurons and subsequent local cortical suppression most parsimoniously explains the reported phenotypes; however, other mechanisms are possible using the technique employed in this paper. The <i>Slc32a1-</i>COP4*H134R/EYFP mouse line used in this study expresses ChR2 in a small set of striatal neurons (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guo et al., 2014</a>). This raises a possibility that blue light directed onto the cortical surface activates striatal neurons and this stimulation is responsible for the described phenotypes. We directly measured the transmission of blue light through the cortex into the striatum (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At the depths (+1.8mm) of the striatum, the intensity of the 473\u00a0nm light is negligible using our experimental strategy. We also implanted fibers into striatum (FT200UMT; Thorlabs Inc; Newton, New Jersey; coordinates: 1.7 mm lateral of midline; 0.5 mm anterior of bregma; 2.25 mm deep of brain surface) of three trained <i>Slc32a1-</i>COP4*H134R/EYFP mice. Delivery of 473\u00a0nm light did not halt prehension behavior (prehension initiation in 190/191 laser trials versus 271/271 control trials) in any of these animals. Therefore, it is very unlikely that activation of striatal neurons is responsible for the behavioral phenotypes described in this paper. Another possibility is that long-range GABAergic inputs to the cortex are labeled in the <i>Slc32a1-</i>COP4*H134R/EYFP and antidromic activation of these inputs inhibits a non-cortical area that is necessary for prehension (<a href=\"#bib30\">Saunders et al., 2015</a>). However, using photostimulation, we were able to produce prehension deficits in mice (n\u00a0=\u00a02 animals, mouse 1 exhibited prehension initiation in 1/24 laser trials versus 69/72 control trials, mouse 2 exhibited prehension initiation in 11/21 laser trials versus 67/67 control trials) where viral injection limited ChR2 expression to sensorimotor cortical neurons (AAV 2/1 or 2/7 Synapsin-FLEX-REV-ChR2, 5 sites in sensorimotor (forelimb) cortex, depths of 300 and 600 \u03bcm) in Gad2-IRES-Cre (Stock number: 010802; The Jackson Laboratory; Bar Harbor, ME) mice. Finally, long-range inhibitory cortical outputs have been reported more rostral of forelimb motor cortex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, it is possible that the blue light activates such neurons in motor cortex resulting in inhibition of non-cortical areas that are responsible for the phenotype. However, evidence for GABAergic projection neurons does not exist for areas that produce the phenotypes described in this paper (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). We also did not detect ChR2-positive axons in the external capsule or corpus callosum of <i>Slc32a1-</i>COP4*H134R/EYFP mice (data not shown), further ruling out the possibility that long\u00a0range cortical inputs and outputs mediate the reported phenotypes."

To address this, the authors adopted a prehension task, widely used as a motor skill learning paradigm in rodents, to head-fixed mice. Combining this task with optogenetic inactivation, which allows inactivation with high temporal resolution, the authors show that mid-movement inactivation is still effective in pausing the execution of learned prehension behavior. The authors also make the surprising observation that the cessation of cortical inactivation often coincides with a short-latency, low-jitter execution of the learned movement. This phenomenon is only seen in learned, motivated animals but does not require the presence of actual food pellets. The authors interpret these results as rebound excitation following inactivation being 'sufficient' to activate the motor engram."

Previous studies did not distinguish, for example, whether cortex is necessary just for the initiation of a motor sequence or whether it is necessary for the execution throughout. This study is particularly timely given the controversy raised by a recent study (Kawai et al., Neuron 2015) suggesting that motor cortex in rodents is not necessary for the execution of movements, and is just required for learning. The previous study used mostly lesions and a lever pressing task. In contrast, the present study uses optogenetic inactivation, providing better temporal resolution (less compensation) and a task where more skilled prehension is required. To summarise, the present study provides compelling evidence that motor cortex is necessary \u2013 at least when performing this particular task \u2013 for movement execution even after the initiation of movement. This is novel and important."

The authors claim that inactivation cessation achieves area-specific activation, while microstimulation can activate fibers of passage. Area-specific stimulation can be achieved by optical stimulation while restricting the opsin expression to a specific area. It would be interesting to know if this method would reproduce the prehension behavior, or if inactivation cessation is special. The latter possibility would suggest that inactivation is important in setting the system in a certain state that is more likely to produce the learned movement upon stimulation.

Most problematically, they claim that 4 of the characteristics of the cessation-induced behaviors are different from those evoked by cortical stimulation. The first two characteristics, namely that it is a coordinated sequence of movements and that it is directed to a goal regardless of the starting position, are actually the very characteristics seen in at least one of the studies they cite (Graziano). Graziano's long stimulation resulted in, for example, the monkeys bringing their arm and hand to their mouth, regardless of the starting position, coinciding with the opening of the mouth. Another example is that, despite their contention that previous studies used temporally non-specific inactivation, Peters et al. used optogenetic inactivation, much the same way used in the current study. Furthermore, despite the contention that their study is contrary to the view proposed by Kawai et al., the current skilled movement being studied would be considered 'dexterous' in their definition and so there is not a contradiction between these previous studies and the present work; further and more balanced discussion of why this report comes to a fundamentally different conclusion to that of Kawai et al. (2015) would therefore be useful. Finally, previous work showing that the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation of M1 in humans, which also interrupts actions which are then completed several 100 ms later, might be worth citing (e.g. Day et al. 1989, Brain; Lemon et al. 1995 J. Neurosci. Figure 8)."
