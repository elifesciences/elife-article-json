Multiple sites of alternative splicing within a single gene exponentially increase the number of possible spliced isoforms, with most human genes currently estimated to express at least ten. To understand the mechanisms underlying these complex isoform expression patterns, methods are needed that faithfully maintain long-range exon connectivity information in individual RNA molecules. In this study, we describe SeqZip, a methodology that uses RNA-templated DNA\u2013DNA ligation to retain and compress connectivity between distant sequences within single RNA molecules. Using this assay, we test proposed coordination between distant sites of alternative exon utilization in mouse <i>Fn1</i>, and we characterize the extraordinary exon diversity of <i>Drosophila melanogaster Dscam1</i>."

Multiple sites of alternative splicing within a single gene exponentially increase the number of possible spliced isoforms, with most human genes currently estimated to express at least ten. To understand the mechanisms underlying these complex isoform expression patterns, methods are needed that faithfully maintain long-range exon connectivity information in individual RNA molecules. In this study, we describe SeqZip, a methodology that uses RNA-templated DNA\u2013DNA ligation to retain and compress connectivity between distant sequences within single RNA molecules. Using this assay, we test proposed coordination between distant sites of alternative exon utilization in mouse <i>Fn1</i>, and we characterize the extraordinary exon diversity of <i>Drosophila melanogaster Dscam1</i>."

Genes and their RNA copies contain instructions with more steps\u2014called exons\u2014than are necessary to make a working protein, so extra exons are removed (\u2018spliced\u2019) from the RNA copies.

Around 58% of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> genes and &gt;95% of human genes produce more than one transcript (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brown et al., 2014</a>), with most human genes expressing 10 or more distinct isoforms (<a href=\"#bib14\">Djebali et al., 2012</a>). Alternative promoter use, alternative splicing, and alternative polyadenylation all contribute to isoform diversity. In genes with multiple alternative transcription start and/or pre-mRNA processing sites, their combinatorial potential exponentially increases the number of possible products, with some human genes predicted to express &gt;100 mRNA isoforms. In <i>D. melanogaster</i>, the number of isoforms observed per gene correlates with open reading frame length, suggesting that isoform complexity is a function of transcript length (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brown et al., 2014</a>). The current record holder in this regard is <i>Dscam1</i>, in which four regions of mutually exclusive cassette exons combine to generate a remarkable 38,016 distinct &gt;7000 nt mRNAs, each encoding a unique protein isoform (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schmucker et al., 2000</a>)."

This feature of multiple alternative splicing regions separated by constitutive exons is shared by more than a quarter of human genes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fededa et al., 2005</a>). In many cases, these regions are separated by &gt;500 nts, the current limit for contiguous sequence output on most deep sequencing platforms. Further, high-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-Seq) generally requires its reverse transcription, with the processivity of available reverse transcriptases (RTs) limiting even single molecule cDNA sequencing (e.g., Pacific Biosciences) to &lt;2500 nt (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sharon et al., 2013</a>). Thus, existing high-throughput technologies cannot readily retain connectivity information between very distant sequences within individual mRNA molecules. Instead, full-length transcripts must be inferred by piecing together multiple short overlapping reads (<a href=\"#bib19\">Garber et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Grabherr et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Haas et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boley et al., 2014</a>). For widely separated regions of alternative exon use, this loss of connectivity significantly limits our abilities to catalog isoform abundance and understand the mechanisms underlying alternative isoform generation."

SeqZip uses sets of DNA oligonucleotides termed \u2018ligamers\u2019. Each \u223c40\u201360 nt ligamer hybridizes to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of a single alternatively spliced exon or the beginning and end of a large block of constitutively included exons, looping out the sequences in between. These loops can be hundreds to thousands of nucleotides long. Juxtaposed ligamers hybridized to single RNA molecules are then joined by enzymatic ligation with T4 RNA ligase 2 (Rnl2) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ho and Shuman, 2002</a>). The resultant DNA ligation products both capture the intramolecular connectivity among exons of interest and compress the sequence space necessary to identify those exons. Exon connectivity is subsequently decoded by assessing the sizes or sequences of the ligation products. Because SeqZip does not include an RT step and is therefore not subject to RT processivity and template-switching limitations, it can be used to assess intramolecular connectivity between regions separated by thousands of nucleotides. Further, relative ligation product abundance accurately reports spliced isoform abundance in the original sample. As a proof-of-principle, we here used SeqZip to test proposed connectivity relationships among alternatively spliced exons in mouse <i>Fibronectin</i> (<i>Fn1)</i> and to define the molecular diversity of fly <i>Dscam1</i>."

The original suggestion that an upstream splicing decision can affect a downstream splicing decision came from analysis of the EDA and V regions where it was reported that EDA exclusion promotes use of the promoter-proximal 3\u2032 splice site (\u2018120\u2019) in the V region (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fededa et al., 2005</a>). The EDA and V regions are separated by six constitutively included exons, comprising 813 nt; thus, RT-PCR products including the EDA and V regions range from 1 to 1.6 kbp (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Both the overall length of the RT-PCR products and the extensive region of similar sequence identity in the middle that can promote template switching (see below) confound RT-PCR analysis of the six possible EDA and V exon combinations. In comparison, our SeqZip ligation products were &gt;fivefold smaller (139\u2013318 nt; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>), and they contained no intervening region of extensive nucleotide identity. Thus, SeqZip provided a new means to test the possibility of connectivity between <i>Fn1</i> EDA and V splicing decisions."

That study also analyzed mice heterozygous for the modified locus (+/\u2212) and the wild-type parental strain (wt/wt). We obtained immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts generated from all four mouse lines and performed SeqZip analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Three different ligamer pools allowed us to analyze each region in isolation (individual pools A and V) or both regions together (combination pool A + V) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). EDA and V isoform ratios determined from low cycle, radioactive PCR band intensities of the A and V pool ligation products (SeqZip: Observed) were used to calculate expected EDA:V isoform abundances, assuming no interdependence between the two regions (SeqZip: Expected). We also generated cDNAs by low-cycle RT-PCR and sequenced them on a Pacific Biosciences RSII instrument (PacBio:Observed), a single molecule platform with sufficient read length to maintain connectivity between the EDA and V regions (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sharon et al., 2013</a>)."

Regardless, neither SeqZip nor PacBio yielded any evidence for an effect of EDA inclusion or exclusion on V region splice site choice. That is, in no case was the observed frequency of any A + V combination statistically different from the frequency expected for independent events.

The high similarity among the cassette exon sequences within each cluster raised the possibility that ligamers would bind near-cognate as well as cognate sequences. To assess the potential for mis-pairing, we calculated the free energy of hybridization (<a href=\"#bib47\">Reuter and Mathews, 2010</a>) between each ligamer and all exon variants within its target cluster (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Cognate ligamer\u2013exon pairs had predicted hybridization energies lower than \u0394G\u00b0 = \u221267 kcal/mol; the closest near-cognate pair was \u226512 kcal/mole higher. In the control experiments containing just three <i>Dscam1</i> isoforms, only 642 of 50,475 high-confidence alignments (1.3%) contained ligamers for exons not present in any input transcript, with the majority of these species (221/236) represented by three or fewer reads (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Nonetheless, two near-cognate hybridization products with &gt;100 reads were detected. Although both were less abundant (2.4- and 372-fold lower) than reads corresponding to cognate targets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), this does raise a cautionary note with regard to interpretation of extremely low abundance ligation products in experiments wherein near-cognate ligation is a possibility. On the other hand, SeqZip accurately reported input cognate isoform abundances over 3 orders of magnitude (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, as with <i>CD45</i> and <i>Fn1</i> isoforms, SeqZip proved highly quantitative for assessing the majority of <i>Dscam1</i> isoforms."

Ligamers targeting every exon variant in clusters 4, 6, and 9 together with ligamers for constitutive exons 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10 (97 ligamers in all) reduced the median size of mRNA sequences analyzed from 1734 nt (1722\u20131751 nt for exons 3\u201310) to 356 nt for a seven-ligamer product formed by six ligation events. This approximately fivefold length reduction allowed the products to be fully sequenced using 250 bp, paired-end reads in a single Illumina MiSeq run (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Between 449,113 and 946,110, high-confidence alignments were obtained for each sample (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Across all three samples, SeqZip detected 8397 of the 18,612 possible isoforms (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

The absence of exon 6.11 reads from our libraries provides additional evidence for the specificity of SeqZip. Further, with two exceptions, the patterns of individual exon use in S2 cells were directly comparable between the SeqZip and CAMSeq data sets (<i>r</i> = 0.87, p &lt; 2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>, Fisher z-transformation; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>): exon 6.47 was well represented in the CAMSeq data but undetectable by SeqZip, and exon 9.31 was more abundantly represented in our data."

One potential explanation for this effect is promoter-dependent polymerase speed: slow RNA synthesis favors inclusion of cassette exons with weak splicing signals, while fast RNA synthesis favors their exclusion (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fededa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dujardin et al., 2014</a>). This polymerase speed effect does not necessitate any dependence of a downstream splicing decision on an upstream decision\u2014the multiple sites of alternative splicing can be independently but similarly influenced by polymerase speed.

SeqZip, however, does preserve single molecule connectivity, so is perfectly suited to investigate coordination mechanisms.

Thus, \u223c8\u201312 ligamers is currently the upper limit for high-throughput sequencing analyses. Although our quantitative analysis of <i>CD45</i> showed no difference in ligation efficiency for isoforms requiring two ligations compared to those requiring five (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), other transcripts could theoretically differ. Because exon-excluded isoforms require fewer ligations, as the number of sites being examined grows, it is possible that detection of shorter (i.e., exon-excluded) transcripts will be favored. Thus, if a SeqZip experiment requires different numbers of ligation events for different RNA isoforms, it is crucial to perform the necessary controls to ensure quantitative detection of all desired isoforms. In our experiments, we were able to demonstrate accurate isoform abundance reporting over &gt;4 orders of magnitude for <i>Dscam</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). At the low end of this range, however, near-cognate ligation events began to be problematic. As for sensitivity, we have been able to obtain detectable ligation products from as few as \u223c900 (5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221217</sup> M; 0.05 fM) target RNA molecules (data not shown). Because the limit of detection for SeqZip is likely more than a single molecule, lack of detection of a particular isoform should only be interpreted as that isoform being below the SeqZip detection limit. Nonetheless, when properly controlled, SeqZip is a sensitive quantitative method for assessing complex isoform abundance patterns over a wide dynamic range."

However, many mammalian transcripts have more varied alternative splicing, including alternative 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice site usage and intron retention. Ligamer design against these types of alternative splicing quickly becomes unwieldy. For example, characterization of alternative transcriptional start and polyadenylation sites requires different terminal ligamers for each different start or polyadenylation site. Thus, while we were able to simultaneously assess two different types of alternative splicing in <i>Fn1</i> (exon inclusion/exclusion and alternative 3\u2032 splice sites), other mammalian genes displaying even more numerous forms of alternative processing (e.g., <i>Kcnma1</i>) would require significantly more complicated ligamer pools. Indeed, there may be genes with splicing patterns that cannot be readily interrogated with a single ligamer pool capable of generating a unique ligation product for every possible isoform. In such cases, analysis using multiple ligamer pools each targeting a select region may still be advantageous for estimating splicing frequencies compared to more traditional methods like quantitative RT-PCR. To assist readers in designing their own ligamer pools, we have included a schematic of our ligamer design process for mouse <i>Fn1</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>).

Most current methods for profiling the expressed alternatively spliced isoforms of a gene use short read RNAseq to assess the linkage of individual exons and thus require different positions of alternative splicing within a transcript to be examined independently. This is a problem for assembling the correct set of complete mRNAs from a gene as information on the combinatorial relationships and possible coregulation of distant exons is lost, although these relationships can frequently be deduced by statistical inference. The new method, \u201cSeqZip\u201d, uses oligo ligation directed by the mRNA template to report on exon-exon joints present in the mRNA and to condense distant regions of splice variation into a much shorter sequences assayable by sequencing or simply by size. The method is clever and the biochemistry is very well done, but no new biological insights are presented. The interest here is in the technology and the widespread need for such an assay. However, as a methods paper the study has several failings that need to be addressed."

One oligo can have quite different ligation activities when joined to different partners. Different oligos have such drastically different annealing and ligation efficiency especially since they can also form various inter- and intra-molecular interactions when the complexity is increased. As a result, the poorest one will be the rate-limiting factor for the whole isoform presentation. For individual isoform pairs under different conditions, we use ratio/ratio to infer changes, but in the current study, this is not feasible. They may argue that a poor oligo will affect all isoforms equally, and thus, it is not a problem. However, other isoforms that lack the targeting exon for such poor oligo will be over represented. This problem may not surface with low complexity system. But, it is likely that it will soon be encountered by others, if the system is adopted, and if not properly addressed, the method will have little impact. This is a critical point for the authors to assess."

It seems likely that some regions will still need to be assayed separately and combinations predicted statistically. What are the limitations here? How complex a set of ligamers is feasible? Is there an upper limit on length that can be sequenced as a single fragment? Given such a length limit, what determines the number and spacing of alternative events that can be assayed by a ligamer set targeting all the possible products? Exactly how did the DSCAM mapping and variant quantification work? It appears that DSCAM isoforms were identified and counted by aligning to a library of isoform sequences and somehow scoring for sequence match. This needs to be described in much more detail. For this to be a useful method, it will need to be applicable to other complex transcript sets. It is not clear how feasible this is.

Oligo Ligation as an assay for specific sequences in a complex mixture goes back at least to Landegren and Hood. The method here is basically an extension of RASL-seq. It doesn't take away from the advance to reference these precedents. The authors comment on the better performance on SeqZip over CamSeq and PacBio long read sequencing. However, examining <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2E</a> and Supplement 6A, they appear comparable. When discussing CamSeq, in the section \u201cSeqZip eliminates <i>Dscam1</i> isoform template switching analysis artifacts\u201d, it is not clear what the authors mean by the sentence: \u201cAlthough template-switched and unexplained isoforms together represented just 0.6-0.94% of all reads, they account for 99.9% of multi-exon isoforms sequenced\u2026\u201d The authors state that detection of template switched isoforms is much lower for SeqZip, but later report that 1.3% of the alignments in the sequencing of the DSCAM ligation products contained exons not present in the input.
