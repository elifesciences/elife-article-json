The compositions of eukaryotic organelles arise through a process of molecular exchange via vesicle traffic. Here we statistically sample tens of thousands of homeostatic vesicle traffic networks generated by realistic molecular rules governing vesicle budding and fusion. Remarkably, the plurality of these networks contain chains of compartments that undergo creation, compositional maturation, and dissipation, coupled by molecular recycling along retrograde vesicles. This motif precisely matches the cisternal maturation model of the Golgi, which was developed to explain many observed aspects of the eukaryotic secretory pathway. In our analysis cisternal maturation is a robust consequence of vesicle traffic homeostasis, independent of the underlying details of molecular interactions or spatial stacking. This architecture may have been exapted rather than selected for its role in the secretion of large cargo."

It posits that secretory cargo travel in cisternal\u00a0compartments that slowly mature from the <i>cis</i>-Golgi to the <i>trans</i>-Golgi composition. This is driven by three processes. (1) New <i>cis</i>-cisternae are created by the homotypic fusion of ER-derived COPII vesicles at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nakano and Luini, 2010</a>). (2) Old <i>trans</i>-cisternae dissipate by the vesiculation of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) into Golgi-to-surface carriers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bard and Malhotra, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">De Matteis and Luini, 2008</a>). (3) Golgi-resident proteins are recycled along retrograde vesicles, including COPI vesicles, moving from older to younger cisternae (<a href=\"#bib34\">Papanikou et al., 2015</a>). Similar processes govern the maturation of endosomes in the endocytic pathway (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rink et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Poteryaev et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</a>)."

However, large secretory cargo would be impossible without a fully developed cisternal maturation mechanism in the first place. Exaptation can resolve this evolutionary Catch-22 paradox: if a complex trait arose in stages through neutral or non-adaptive processes, it could later be co-opted for new cellular functions (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lynch, 2007a</a>). Such a mechanism explains the origins of complex eukaryotic features such as splicing, transcriptional feedback loops, and multi-subunit protein complexes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lynch and Conery, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lynch, 2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fern\u00e1ndez and Lynch, 2011</a>). Here we extend this idea beyond genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes, to eukaryotic membrane organization: we demonstrate that cisternal maturation is a near-inevitable consequence of the basic processes of vesicle traffic and cellular homeostasis, prior to any selection for function. The architecture of the Golgi could therefore have arisen non-adaptively, enabling the subsequent development of large-cargo secretion. Our results refute the Catch-22 and provide a strong evolutionary foundation for the cisternal maturation model, reinforcing the wealth of cell-biological evidence in its favor across multiple cellular contexts (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bonfanti et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Losev et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006</a>)."

These approaches require a large number of quantitative kinetic parameters to analyze even simple systems with a few molecules and compartments, and are not suited to explore cell-wide vesicle traffic networks. Here we are primarily interested in cell-wide homeostatic network topologies. We have previously shown (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ramadas and Thattai, 2013</a>) that topological features of a vesicle traffic network \u2013 the number of compartments and their connectivity \u2013 are robustly determined by qualitative molecular specificity rather than quantitative kinetics. We therefore formalize the properties of vesicle traffic using a Boolean framework (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mani and Thattai, 2016</a>): we approximate molecular specificities and compartment compositions by a series of 1 s and 0 s (Materials and methods: The Boolean vesicle traffic model). We assume the cytoplasm is well mixed, and do not consider spatial organization; we are agnostic to the relative amounts of molecules on each vesicle, the size of vesicles and compartments, and the quantitative kinetic flux of vesicles between compartments. Boolean models have been successfully applied to transcriptional and signaling networks (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kauffman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chaves et al., 2005</a>); but have not previously been used to study vesicle traffic. Our Boolean approach allows us to efficiently sample a large space of cell-biological rules, and produces results that are qualitatively similar to more detailed microscopic vesicle traffic models (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>; <a href=\"#B1\">Box 1</a>)."

The behavior of vesicles and compartments depends on their compositions, but can also depend on their size, for example through the influence of curvature or membrane tension. Suppose the fusion matrix specifies that vesicles of composition <i>A</i> fuse to compartments of composition <i>B</i>. This does not automatically imply that two vesicles of compositions <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, or two compartments of compositions <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, must fuse to one another. Here we explicitly assume that compartments cannot fuse heterotypically to one another, and that transport vesicles cannot fuse heterotypically to one another. However, compartments (<a href=\"#bib39\">Stenmark, 2009</a>) and transport vesicles (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nakano and Luini, 2010</a>) are known to fuse homotypically in certain situations. Homotypic compartment fusion, if it does occur, has no influence on our Boolean dynamics; in contrast, homotypic vesicle fusion has a key role to play. The dynamics often generate orphan vesicles that find no target compartment. Left unchecked these would leak out of the system, preventing homeostasis. Here we focus on homeostatic states in which a small specific subset of orphan vesicles can undergo homotypic fusion and nucleate new compartments, as seen in real cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nakano and Luini, 2010</a>). Such vesicles would have to fuse much more efficiently to one another than to compartments of the same composition, perhaps mediated by size-dependent effects (brown arrows, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#B1\">Box 1</a>)."

Starting from some initial condition, we run Boolean updates. If at any point we encounter a homeostatic state with no orphans, we stop. If we encounter a state with orphan vesicles, we check what happens if specifically those vesicles could homotypically fuse to nucleate compartments. If this produces a homeostatic state, we stop. If not, we use the resulting state as our initial condition. We nullify assumptions about homotypic vesicle fusion, and repeat the process. In practice we find that a small dose of homotypic fusion is often sufficient to achieve homeostasis: over 80% of our homeostatic networks require two or fewer types of homotypically fusing vesicles."

Most maturation chains (72%) terminated at fixed compartments; terminal oscillating compartments were uncommon (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The majority (61%) of such fixed terminal compartments gave up all their cargo as vesicles at the next timepoint, and thus dissipated. When we examined the flow of molecules and vesicles within maturation chains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), we found a striking and unexpected feature: younger compartments were disproportionately likely to receive retrograde vesicles directly from their older successors, over eight times more often than expected by chance (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, right panel). Individual molecules treadmilled in place within a chain, hopping to younger compartments via retrograde vesicles, driving their conversion to the older composition. The first compartment of a maturation chain tended to be compositionally simpler than its successors (at least in terms of the active labels considered here) due to the treadmilling molecules present on the latter."

For the right panel, the chance of finding a B to A vesicle when A matures to B (median 0.75) is eight fold more than the chance across all pairs (median 0.09). For example, suppose a network with 10 compartments has <math id=\"inf48\"><mrow><mn>10</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><mn>9</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>90</mn></mrow></math> compartment pairs A,B.

This corresponds to a network with an x-value of 0.09 and a y-value of 0.75: there are many more retrograde vesicles between maturing compartments than expected by chance.

The basic, well-established dynamics of vesicle traffic \u2013 in which the specificity of vesicle formation and fusion is locally regulated through molecular interactions \u2013 are sufficient to generate a Golgi-like structure without fine tuning. We emphasize that our results pertain to cell-wide vesicle traffic rather than narrowly to the Golgi apparatus, and have implications for maturation dynamics observed in other secretory and endocytic systems (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mani and Thattai, 2016</a>). Almost all networks with maturation chains also contained stable compartments with balanced vesicular transport: these structures co-exist, they not mutually exclusive. Classic models of membrane traffic focus on the generation of stable compartments out of the dynamic process of vesicle exchange (<a href=\"#bib16\">Heinrich and Rapoport, 2005</a>). The few that consider maturation introduce it by hand, and study subsequent features of protein transport (<a href=\"#bib14\">Glick et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Weiss and Nilsson, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dmitrieff et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ispolatov and M\u00fcsch, 2013</a>). In contrast, maturation is not built into our framework, it emerges spontaneously. When a basic model is sufficient to generate cisternal maturation, the burden of proof is on complex models to justify additional ingredients."

The connectivity of a vesicle traffic network is primarily determined by molecular chemical specificity, while the locations of compartments are determined by complex and largely unknown biophysical mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yadav and Linstedt, 2011</a>). The spatial organization of a cell clearly impacts all aspects of its activity, including vesicle traffic. To add a physical dimension to our analysis, we explored the hypothesis that a cell is like an efficient city-wide logistics system: one in which no part of a city is too far from a warehouse, and warehouses with more traffic between them are placed closer to one another (<a href=\"#bib40\">Taniguchi et al., 1999</a>). For each network in our dataset, we ran an optimization algorithm to distribute compartments uniformly across a cell while minimizing the distance travelled by vesicles between compartments (Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods: Spatial optimization). Remarkably, maturation chains in such optimized networks immediately organized into spatially contiguous stacks: each compartment was adjacent in space to the type of compartment it matures to in time (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This was mainly due to the excess of retrograde vesicles within maturation chains, though most vesicles still traveled long distances. The stacked morphology of the Golgi apparatus in many eukaryotes is thus consistent with the expectations of efficient traffic. Experiments with repositioned organelles might be used to test these ideas further (<a href=\"#bib42\">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</a>). However, hypotheses about function and efficiency are much more difficult to prove than those about molecular mechanism. Our main result is based only on the latter: as vesicle traffic networks evolve, cisternal maturation is easily discoverable by mutation, prior to any selection. For the Golgi apparatus, form might have preceded function."

Each element of such a vector is 1 or 0, indicating whether a certain label type is present in high or low amounts, loosely referred to as presence or absence. For example, for <i>N</i> = 3 the row vector [101] indicates that only the first and third label types are present on the corresponding compartment or vesicle.

We use the prescription described in <a href=\"#equ6\">Equation 6</a> to update the system in discrete timesteps starting from the initial condition. Since this is a deterministic dynamical system over a discrete state space, once sufficient time has elapsed all trajectories will converge onto one or more periodic orbits: a set of states which form a cycle under updates. Each rule will in general have many periodic orbits as attractors, and different initial conditions can converge to different orbits. For each initial condition, we run the system for 1024 timesteps or until it reaches a periodic orbit. A period-1 orbit, which updates to itself, is particularly relevant: it is a homeostatic state (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,E</a>).

For each homeostatic network in our dataset, we break the network into individual compartments, then reconnect them as follows. We remove all vesicle edges. We then randomly swap remaining edge targets, allowing only swaps between maturation edges or between creation edges. We reject the swap if: a self edge is lost; a self edge is created; or multiple edges of the same type arise between the same source and target nodes. This procedure preserves all individual node properties: self edges, and the separate indegrees and outdegrees of creation and maturation edges. We generate 1000 randomly shuffled networks for each original network. We find that these shuffled networks have precisely the same distribution of motif frequencies and maturation chain lengths as the original networks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,BC</a>). This supports the idea that a random graph generation approach might capture relevant features of vesicle traffic networks."

The simplicity of the approach enables the authors to perform an unbiased survey of a large number of possible vesicle trafficking scenarios. A surprising and striking result is that many of the networks display the properties of compartmental maturation. Thus, the evolution of Golgi maturation can be viewed as a natural outcome of the intrinsic properties of vesicle trafficking systems. According to this view, the transport of large secretory cargo molecules was probably an adaptation that took advantage of an existing process."

In some cases, Rab cascades are thought to regulate compartmental maturation.

The other two reviewers were of the opinion that the cytoplasm is well mixed, so it is reasonable to assume that vesicles will reach any potential destination. But to convince the skeptical reviewer and other readers, you should explain why spatiotemporal parameters can be ignored for the purposes of your simulation. In particular, the markers used in your simulation reach a steady-state homeostatic distribution, but is it automatically true that all of the other components, such as lipids, will also undergo balanced flows in a given network? Does your model require the unrealistic assumption that every compartment generates the same number and size of vesicles per unit time? Is it obvious that movement between compartment is fast relative to formation and fusion of vesicles, so that spatial aspects can be neglected?"

They should also describe the networks that do not contain maturation chains, which actually represent the majority of the outcomes. They should discuss which parameters lead to realistic maturation chains, and which preclude maturation. What is interesting to me is not the fact that they observe maturation as this outcome is expected, but the fact that the maturation networks are so complex and so similar to the real ones, and so frequent. Again they should thoroughly describe the maturation chains, the alternative outcomes and the conditions where they obtain. Without this description we cannot judge the value of the simulations.\""

We have removed the confusing term \u201cvirtual stacking\u201d and have explained the motivation of this analysis. It is a speculative analysis which is why we left it to the Discussion section. Briefly: Spatial locations of compartments are caused by many layers of biophysical mechanisms. We were speculating about the potential function of the precise locations. In particular, we explored whether any of the results from the theory of logistic networks (warehouses locations connected by trucks) might apply to cellular vesicle traffic networks. In the efficient logistics context, the goal is to spread out the warehouses as evenly as possible while minimizing the distances travelled by trucks. If we imagine compartments to be warehouses and vesicles to be trucks, what would the optimal spatial organization of compartments look like? There is a simple algorithm which produces this optimal configuration, as described in \u201cMethods: Spatial Optimization\u201d. It involves minimizing a certain \u201cenergy function\u201d which measures how uniformly compartments/warehouses are distributed and how far vesicles/trucks must travel. The intuition behind why this energy function works is that it resembles a system of repelling charges and attracting springs, but that is merely for the sake explanation, the optimization procedure is the main point. In our original analysis the text misleadingly seemed to read that the \u201csprings\u201d and \u201ccharges\u201d were the actual physical causes of the locations, this is not the case. Of course it is complex biophysical regulation which actually places compartments at precise locations."
