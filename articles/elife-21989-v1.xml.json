Here, we report C-terminus mediated inhibition (CMI) for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 that multiple motifs coordinate to tune down Ca<sup>2+</sup> current and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx toward the lower limits determined by end-stage CDI (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation). Among IQV (preIQ3-IQ domain), PCRD and DCRD (proximal or distal C-terminal regulatory domain), spatial closeness of any two modules, <i>e.g.</i>, by constitutive fusion, facilitates the trio to form the complex, compete against calmodulin, and alter the gating. Acute CMI by rapamycin-inducible heterodimerization helps reconcile the concurrent activation/inactivation attenuations to ensure Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is reduced, in that Ca<sup>2+</sup> current activated by depolarization is potently (~65%) inhibited at the peak (full activation), but not later on (end-stage inactivation, ~300 ms). Meanwhile, CMI provides a new paradigm to develop Ca<sub>V</sub>1 inhibitors, the therapeutic potential of which is implied by computational modeling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 dysregulations related to Parkinson's disease."
