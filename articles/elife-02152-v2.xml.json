For example, juvenile songbirds learn to sing by comparing their song with the memory of a tutor song. At present, the brain regions subserving song evaluation are not known. In this study, we report several findings suggesting that song evaluation involves an avian 'cortical' area previously shown to project to the dopaminergic midbrain and other downstream targets. We find that this ventral portion of the intermediate arcopallium (AIV) receives inputs from auditory cortical areas, and that lesions of AIV result in significant deficits in vocal learning. Additionally, AIV neurons exhibit fast responses to disruptive auditory feedback presented during singing, but not during nonsinging periods. Our findings suggest that auditory cortical areas may guide learning by transmitting song evaluation signals to the dopaminergic midbrain and/or other subcortical targets."

Songbirds learn their vocalizations by storing a memory, or \u2018template\u2019, of their tutor's song (<a href=\"#bib13\">Doupe and Kuhl, 1999</a>). By listening to themselves sing and comparing their own song to this template (<a href=\"#bib31\">Konishi, 1965</a>), they gradually converge to what can be a nearly exact copy of the tutor's song. Vocal learning requires a basal-ganglia forebrain circuit called the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), the output of which projects to cortical premotor vocal areas (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nottebohm et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bottjer et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Scharff and Nottebohm, 1991</a>).

First, we characterized the spatial extent of the arcopallial neurons projecting to VTA or SNc, and characterized the inputs to these neurons from auditory cortical fields. We then carried out lesions targeted to this area to examine the effect on tutor imitation and on vocal plasticity that occurs after deafening. Finally, we recorded from VTA/SNc-projecting neurons in the arcopallium of singing birds and observed fast transient responses to disruptive auditory feedback during singing. Altogether, our findings suggest that descending auditory cortical projections may play a role in song evaluation via projections to the dopaminergic midbrain and/or other subcortical targets."

This comparison results in an acoustic similarity score and a sequence similarity score. Acoustic similarity estimates the similarity of each of the tutor's syllables to the best match in the pupil's song. The sequence similarity score represents the acoustic similarity of song segments preceding and following these closest-match syllables. The overall tutor imitation score is the product of the acoustic and sequence similarity scores. Song stereotypy (panel <b>C</b>) was quantified by measuring the peak of the spectrogram cross-correlation between different bouts of the birds song with itself (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aronov et al., 2008</a>). This measure was shown to gradually increase through song development, and therefore we refer to it as the maturity index."

Since we have hypothesized that AIV is involved in vocal learning, we wondered whether lesions targeted to this area might slow the degradation of song after deafening. To test this idea, we carried out bilateral cochlear removal in combination with bilateral AIV lesions (n = 15, 75\u201380 dph). Songs were recorded for 2 weeks following this procedure and were analyzed for similarity to the pre-surgery song. Song degradation after deafening was significantly slower in AIV-lesioned birds than in birds with intact AIV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>, comparison at 7 days and 14 days post-lesion, <i>t</i> test p=0.0074, 0.0096 respectively). The reduced rate of deafening-induced song degradation after AIV lesion suggests a role for descending auditory cortical pathways, including possibly those projecting to the dopaminergic midbrain, in mediating the plastic changes in the AFP and motor pathways that occurs after deafening."

(<b>A</b>) Sagittal section showing neurons in AIV retrogradely labeled by an injection of a CTB into VTA/SNc.

White circles indicate where no significant response was observed. Dashed line indicates the penetration along which reference electrolytic burn marks were made. (<b>B</b>\u2013<b>D</b>) Example responses to VTA/SNc stimulation are shown at selected recording sites along each of three electrode tracks. Significant antidromic responses were observed only at locations where retrogradely labeled neurons were subsequently found. Specifically, there was no antidromic response seen in the gap between the main posterior mass of retrogradely neurons and the more anterior stripe. Nor were antidromic responses observed antero-ventral to the anterior stripe, within the borders of RA, nor dorsal to the thin rim of retrogradely labeled neurons along the dorsal border of RA. <i>Note on methods:</i> Retrograde tracer (CTB) was injected into VTA and SNc, and bipolar stimulating electrodes were implanted into the same region. The head was then oriented with the flat anterior portion of the skull rotated forward at a pitch of 70\u00b0. RA was completely mapped based on its characteristic electrophysiological signature (regular spiking interspersed with bursts). Electrode penetrations (Carbostar, Kation Scientific) were made in a plane 200 \u00b5m medial from the lateral edge of RA and penetrations were made at several locations along the AP axis in this plane. For each penetration, recordings were made along a 1\u20131.5 mm range of DV coordinates spanning through the arcopallium. For each recording site the existence of antidromic responses was tested with single 0.2 ms monopolar pulses, current up to 350 \u00b5A and with both polarities of stimulation current. If no antidromic response was observed visually, responses were recorded using the maximum current (350 \u00b5A), otherwise, responses were recorded at 130% of threshold current. In each recording penetration, we noted the most ventral coordinate at which the characteristic spontaneous activity of RA was found. After recordings were complete, another electrode was used to make an electrolytic burn at known locations relative to the recording sites. <i>Alignment of antidromic and retrograde maps.</i> The brains were sectioned and stained for NeuN, and retrogradely labeled neurons were visualized. The AP coordinate of every recording site was determined with respect to the electrolytic burns. The DV coordinate of every recording site was determined by aligning the ventral border of RA as determined histologically (NeuN stain) and electrophysiologically (spontaneous activity). <i>Significance of an antidromic response</i>: we analyzed the significance of antidromic responses as follows. For each recording site we computed the frequency spectrum of the averaged response to the stimulus (15 ms window, spanning 2\u201317 ms after stimulus onset). We then computed the power between 200 Hz and 2 KHz. A <i>t</i> test was used to test the hypothesis that the power in this frequency band was significantly higher than the power obtained from recordings with no antidromic response (recorded at 1\u20132 mm dorsal to RA and inspected visually to verify they did not show antidromic response). Note that results were consistent for different frequency bands."

We have characterized the spatial extent of neurons within the intermediate arcopallium that project to VTA and SNc, and refer to the region of arcopallium retrogradely labeled from these midbrain dopaminergic areas as AIV. Using a combination of anatomical and electrophysiological techniques, we have elucidated the afferent inputs to AIV neurons from other cortical areas. We examined the effect on vocal learning of lesions targeted to AIV, and carried out electrophysiological recordings of AIV neurons. Our findings are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that an arcopallial region with descending auditory cortical projections, both to the dopaminergic midbrain and to midbrain and brainstem auditory centers, plays a role in vocal learning."

Our anatomical findings suggest that AIV, while adjacent to Ad, is part of a distinct, largely non-overlapping, anatomical circuit. In contrast to Ad, AIV does not receive a projection from LMAN-shell; rather it receives inputs from auditory cortical areas (CM, L1, and HVC-shelf) and caudal nidopallium. Furthermore, our findings show that AIV, but not Ad, projects to VTA/SNc. Given its anatomical overlap with RAcup, parts of AIV also likely project to MLD or to the shell of the thalamic nucleus ovoidalis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mello et al., 1998</a>)."

In contrast, Feenders et al. showed immediate early gene activation in Ad/LAI and in LMAN-shell (which projects to Ad/LAI) during locomotory activity (i.e., hopping), but find no evidence for activation in these areas during singing. This led them to suggest that Ad/LAI and RA form the output of a general avian cortical motor circuit, of which RA is a component specialized for vocal production (<a href=\"#bib16\">Feenders et al., 2008</a>)."

This subset of neurons, in principle, could be within Ad, within AIV, or could be in another, as yet undescribed, adjacent region important for vocal learning. In our view, the most parsimonious explanation for the detrimental effects on vocal learning is that the Ad lesions of Bottjer and Altenau had an unintended impact on neurons in AIV. More detailed electrophysiological studies of the pathways into and out of Ad will be needed to completely resolve these different views of its function."

Lesions of Area X, the basal ganglia component of the AFP, in young birds have a substantial detrimental effect on song imitation and result in persistent song variability into adulthood (<a href=\"#bib51\">Scharff and Nottebohm, 1991</a>). In contrast, lesions of Area X have relatively little immediate effect on song performance in adult and juvenile birds (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goldberg and Fee, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kojima et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, we found that birds in which AIV was lesioned at an early age produced a poor imitation of the tutor song and developed a less stereotyped song than did control birds, and AIV lesions in adult or juvenile birds have little immediate effect on vocal performance. Lesions of Area X also largely block the degradation of song following deafening (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kojima et al., 2013</a>), and similarly, but to a lesser extent, we found that lesions of AIV slow song degradation in deafened birds. The similar patterns of findings in AIV-lesioned birds and Area X-lesioned birds is consistent with the possibility that the AIV, or some components of it, may interact with the AFP, perhaps by transmitting to it a signal important for its function."

                        "text": "In principle, there are several ways the loss of a descending auditory cortical projections might affect vocal learning. We first address the possible role of the projection from AIV to the dopaminergic midbrain in vocal learning. In the songbird, dopaminergic inputs to Area X have been hypothesized to carry signals related to motivational aspects of singing and to regulate vocal variability, in particular while switching between less variable song directed to a female bird to more variable song produced in social isolation (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yanagihara and Hessler, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hara et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Leblois et al., 2010</a>). Notably, we find that juvenile and young adult birds exhibit normal song variability after AIV lesions, suggesting that AIV may not be involved in the regulation of vocal variability, and that the deficits in vocal learning do not result from a loss of exploratory song variability. Alternatively, reduced glutamatergic drive after AIV lesion could result in reduced tonic dopaminergic input to Area X. In mammals, reduced dopaminergic input to the striatum can have deleterious effects on BG function, including reduced spontaneous activity and the loss of spines in the medium spiny neurons (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</a>). Songbirds exhibit patterns of dopamine receptor expression in cortex and Area X (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kubikova et al., 2010</a>), and responses to dopamine stimulation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ding and Perkel, 2002</a>) that parallel those found in mammals. Finally, another possibility is that impoverished vocal imitation after lesions of AIV results from the loss of a reinforcement signal that carries information about recent song performance. The short-latency response of AIV neurons to disrupted auditory feedback is consistent with the possibility that AIV may play a role in computing or transmitting a fast online signal to VTA/SNc."

Thus, deficits in vocal learning following lesions targeted to AIV could potentially arise from loss of signaling in these other pathways. Further studies will be required to elucidate the relation between neurons projecting to these different downstream targets, and to determine the role of these different pathways in vocal learning."

The projection we describe here in the zebra finch\u2014from the caudal nidopallium (NC) posterior to HVC\u2014terminates primarily in the posterior \u2018stem\u2019 part of AIV. This projection may be related to the previously described nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) projection, although NCL appears to be more lateral than NC. NCL was recently found to be involved in error and reward processing (<a href=\"#bib54\">Starosta et al., 2013</a>), and based on several lines of evidence, it has been suggested that NCL may be analogous to mammalian prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kroner and Gunturkun, 1999</a>). Notably, in mammals the major cortical projection to VTA arises from prefrontal cortex, a key structure for cognitive control and goal-directed actions (<a href=\"#bib42\">Murase et al., 1993</a>)."

These projections were found to terminate near RA, in a region termed RA-cup, and are likely homologous to projections in the pigeon from the dorsal nidopallium (Nd) to the ventromedial intermediate arcopallium (AIvm) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wild et al., 1993</a>). We have confirmed the existence of these projections, and using anatomical tracing and electrophysiological techniques, we have demonstrated that these inputs directly or indirectly innervate AIV neurons projecting to the dopaminergic midbrain. Inputs from L1 and anterior parts of HVC shelf appear localized to the parts of AIV anteroventral to RA. Inputs from posterior HVC shelf appear to terminate in both the anterior and posterior parts of AIV, and show significant overlap with inputs from the more posterior caudal nidopallium described above."

The projection from CM terminates within AIV, and electrical stimulation in CM causes spiking activity in VTA/SNc-projecting AIV neurons, likely through orthodromic activation. The existence of a projection to AIV from CM and L1 may be important for two reasons. The cluster of neurons in CM retrogradely labeled from AIV was overlapped with the region of CM, also known as Avalanche (Av), that forms bidirectional synaptic interactions with both HVC and NIf (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bauer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akutagawa and Konishi, 2010</a>), two song control nuclei also involved in vocal learning (<a href=\"#bib50\">Roberts et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, a small subpopulation of neurons in CM and L1 have been shown to respond to noise bursts presented during singing, but not to noise bursts presented during playback of the birds own song (<a href=\"#bib28\">Keller and Hahnloser, 2009</a>). These responses, highly reminiscent of responses in AIV, have led to the suggestion that one computational function of CM and L1 may be to compare actual auditory feedback with the song template (<a href=\"#bib28\">Keller and Hahnloser, 2009</a>). Further studies are required to determine if the hypothesized error-related responses of AIV neurons derive from activity in this population of CM and L1 neurons."

Most VTA/SNc-projecting AIV neurons responded to disruptive auditory feedback with a latency of less than 25 ms and response duration of less than 100 ms. This response may have a sufficiently fast temporal resolution to mediate vocal learning, assuming that the synaptic learning rules in Area X and the motor pathway employ a short-term synaptic memory such as an eligibility trace (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sutton and Barto, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fee and Goldberg, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Redondo and Morris, 2011</a>).

All AIV lesions were carried out stereotaxically. The head was oriented with the flat anterior portion of the skull rotated forward at a pitch of 70\u00b0. Because a large portion of AIV is located ventral to RA, access to AIV was achieved by a laterally rotated penetration. The head was rotated 45\u00b0 (roll) to the left for lesions of AIV in the right hemisphere, and rotated to the right for lesions of AIV in the left hemisphere. Using a carbon fiber electrode (Mod #E1011-20; Carbostar-1, Kation Scientific.) RA was then completely mapped based on its characteristic electrophysiological signature (regular spiking interspersed with bursts). Once all of the edges of RA were localized in the rotated frame, these were used to calculate the coordinates of the injection sites. In the injection coordinates given below (ML, AP, DV), dimensions are in \u00b5m; positive numbers represent more lateral, more anterior, and more ventral displacements, respectively. The coordinates are specified relative to the lateral edge of RA in the medial\u2013lateral direction, relative to the center of RA in the anterior\u2013posterior direction, and relative to the most ventral edge of RA in the dorsal\u2013ventral direction.

The stereotaxic procedure was similar to that described above for AIV lesions. RA was mapped electrophysiologically to determine the lateral border and center (in the AP direction) of RA. Ad was also mapped electophysiologically by its characteristic bursting patterns, which distinguished it from the overlying arcopallium. Injection sites are listed below: the (ML, AP) coordinates are given in the same notation given above for the AIV lesion. However, the injections were targeted to the center of Ad in the dorso\u2013ventral dimension as determined from electrophysiological mapping of Ad.

The second was a test for a significant peak in the peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) using a bootstrap analysis: over a 2 s window (1 s before stimulus onset to 1 s after stimulus onset) spikes were shifted circularly, where the extent of the shifts were drawn from a uniform distribution of \u00b11 s. Given the resulting PSTH, the peak within 1 s after stimulus was noted. This random shuffling was repeated 1000 times to obtain the distribution of peaks in the shuffled data sets. Neurons that exhibited a real PSTH peak that exceeded the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the shuffled data were considered significant. The significance of song-locked firing rate modulations of AIV neurons during singing was analyzed similarly. The highest observed peak in the motif-aligned PSTH was compared to the distribution of PSTH peaks obtained from surrogate data sets in which spike times were circularly within the motif."

A database of song syllables was constructed for each bird (n = 500\u2013600 syllables). The spectrogram of each syllable was computed using the multi-taper method (k = 2 tapers, bandwidth parameter p=1.5, 10 ms window, 1 ms step size). 100 syllables were randomly selected (without replacement) from the data set. For each selected syllable, a sample of 100 syllables was drawn randomly from the data set. The similarity of the selected syllable to each of the sampled syllables was evaluated following the spectral correlation method: first, the spectrogram correlation matrix was computed from the correlation of power spectra (860 Hz and 8.6 kHz) between each 1 ms time slice in the selected syllable and each 1 ms time slice in the sampled syllable. Second, a lag correlation function was computed as the sum along the diagonals of the correlation matrix. Third, the maximum of the lag correlation function was determined. The values resulting from all comparisons to the selected syllable formed a distribution. The value of the 95 percentile of this distribution represents the stereotypy of the selected syllables. For each bird, the syllable stereotypy metric (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) was computed as the average over all 100 selected syllables."

They further show that AIV neurons that are demonstrated to project to VTA by antidromic activation respond to disruptive auditory feedback during singing but not during the playback of the bird's own song or the bird's own song with disruptive auditory feedback by in vivo single unit (and multiunit) recording in awake unrestrained birds during singing and quiescence. They also show that lesions of the AIV leads to deficits in vocal learning but do not alter song in mature birds. The data set presented is extensive and the analyses quantitative. The AIV neurons described provide an opening to the dopaminergic reward system that promises in future to help elucidate how auditory feedback can alter vocal output: a significant problem in song birds and humans. This analysis will generate wide interest in the songbird and sensory motor integration communities."

The significance of this study lies not only in the identification of this new pathway, but more importantly in the evidence they provide that this pathway carries information from higher-order auditory neurons about auditory feedback error (i.e. neurons in AIV only respond to auditory feedback when feedback is perturbed) and that interruption of this pathway prevents error based vocal learning.

The authors show that lesions of AIV (but not Ad) in juvenile birds prevents vocal imitation of the tutor song even though birds are able to sing songs that have some degree of stereotypy.

However, when short noise bursts are presented during singing (therefore introducing an error in the feedback signal), neurons respond reliably with a short latency response. This response is specific to noise presented during singing and is not mimicked by presentation of noise during passive presentation of the bird's own song."

As such each instance of song where feedback does not match motor intent, there should be a neural response in the neurons. From the data presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G and 5J</a>, this seems to be the case but it is difficult to be sure. This is an important question, because an alternate hypothesis is that this pathway computes the accumulation of feedback error if it occurs in a consistent manner rather than occurring online. If the neurons are responding to an accumulation of error, then one might expect responses to white noise bursts to change (increase of decrease) across trials. On the other hand, if this pathway is truly processing/monitoring error online, then responses should be similar independent of trial number. To address these potentially competing hypotheses, it would be useful for the authors to quantify responses in a slightly different ways to resolve these issues.

They define the region that projects to the VTA/SN as 'AIV' and go on to demonstrate that lesions of AIV in juvenile birds cause development of abnormal song as evaluated at 90 d of age, and lesions in adults reduce deafening induced song plasticity. Additionally, they show that neurons in AIV exhibit response properties to feedback perturbation that suggest a possible role in registering vocal errors and contributing to song learning and plasticity. Overall, there is an impressive amount of data in this study that is consistent with the possibility that this brain region plays an important role in feedback guided song learning and plasticity. The authors note that the anatomically and physiologically defined outputs from AIV to the VTA/SN additionally raise the possibility that such learning depends on descending auditory evaluation signals that may reach the song system via brainstem circuitry. The study adds to our understanding of the neural substrates that contribute to vocal learning in the songbird and thereby sheds light on more general mechanisms of feedback evaluation and learning."

The complex and tight packing of multiple brain regions around RA make it difficult to assess from the data that are presented what are the subdivisions of AIV, where are its boundaries, and whether the effects of lesions should be attributed specifically to damage to one or more components of AIV or to damage of other structures in the vicinity.

B&A termed the region that they lesioned 'Ad' based on prior anatomical studies that identified several afferent and efferent projections to this region. These included projections from LMAN shell and from NCL, and included projections to VTA. Because MC et al. define AIV as the VTA/SN projecting regions surrounding RA, it would seem that the AIV as so defined includes Ad? One portion of AIV that is lesioned by MC et al. also receives projections from NC and sends projections to VTA. Hence, this portion of AIV (which appears to make up a significant part of its bulk), shares some major defining characteristics with the similarly located Ad. I presume that this portion of AIV might be distinguished (as far as anatomy is concerned) by identifying a region from which LMAN-shell afferents are excluded? I am not sure whether the authors have examined this possibility, or can otherwise clarify this issue.

For example, both studies include lesions that are several hundred microns lateral to the lateral most edge of RA, approximately at the depth of the center of RA (as well as more ventrally), and at approximately the R-C center of RA (as well as more rostrally and caudally). With the listed coordinates for both studies it would seem plausible if not likely that the two studies have lesioned overlapping brain regions. Additionally, MC et al. carry out separate control 'Ad' lesions (intended to test whether the reported effects could be due to lesions of Ad rather than AIV. However, the R-C and M-L locations of these Ad lesions (in MC et al.) fall into this same region lateral to RA. The D-V locations of these lesions are not provided, but instead the authors note that Ad lesions were made at depths that corresponded to the electrophysiologically defined boundaries of Ad. The authors should provide the D-V locations of Ad lesions, and some validation of the physiological criteria for defining the boundaries of Ad. I suppose that the authors' intent with their Ad lesions was to show that lesions restricted to the region lateral to RA (that may have been lesioned in both the 'AIV' lesions of CM et al. and the 'Ad' lesions of B&A) are insufficient to elicit the behavioral deficits associated with the 'AIV' lesions. However, because the authors use a lower concentration (and volume) of NMA for their Ad lesions than for their AIV lesions (1% versus 2%) this argument needs to be bolstered with some careful analysis of histology to establish exactly what was destroyed in each experiment. If I understand, the authors' argument is that lesions to 'AIV' that exclude the region lateral to RA (where they made ineffective 'Ad lesions') would be effective for disrupting learning. Are there examples with this pattern of damage? More broadly, the authors need to show us more of the histology that is associated with their lesions of AIV and of Ad and provide more detail on the criteria used for distinguishing between these regions, and also provide some more help in determining the relationship between the current study and prior work."

The authors devise a 'tutor imitation score' that is a single number intended to capture how closely the juvenile songs (at 90d of age) match the tutor song (in terms of both the copying of individual notes and of the sequencing of notes). Because this measure has not been used in previous studies of birdsong, it is difficult to interpret. The authors provide as reference the imitation score for unrelated adult songs, and suggest that AIV lesion birds are almost as dissimilar to the tutor song as unrelated adult birds' songs are to each other. However, there are many ways in which the quality of match between experimental and tutor songs may differ and it is important in reporting results and for purposes of comparing with previous studies for the authors to figure out how to provide more clarity about how the AIV songs differ from the tutor songs. For example, deafening, lesions of LMAN, lesions of X and lesions of Ad (in B&amp;A;) in juvenile birds all appear to disrupt imitation, but in different ways. CM et al., suggest that the nature of song disruption caused by their AIV lesions may be similar to the effects of X-lesions in juvenile birds (as reported by Scharff and Nottebohm). However, the single example that is shown (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) does not look particularly like the examples of X-lesion birds in Scharff's study."

It would be helpful if the authors presented spectrograms from more birds to give a clearer qualitative sense of what is going in, and some context for better understanding what different values of the imitation score (and other new measures introduced here) mean. This should include examples of good and bad imitation from controls and from AIV lesion (and perhaps also Ad lesion) birds. For example, do the control birds that have imitation scores around 0.1 and below look as dissimilar to the tutor song as do the unrelated adults? Are these control birds disrupted in a qualitatively similar manner to the AIV lesion birds that also have scores in that range? Regardless of what measures the authors use, they need to more clearly convey to the reader the extent to which the effects of AIV lesions parallel the effects of X-lesions (as reported by Scharff) and/or Ad lesions (as reported by B&A)."

They also show that lesions of the AIV leads to deficits in vocal learning but do not alter song in mature birds. The data set presented is extensive and the analyses quantitative. The AIV neurons described provide an opening to the dopaminergic reward system that promises in future to help elucidate how auditory feedback can alter vocal output: a significant problem in song birds and humans. This analysis will generate wide interest in the songbird and sensory motor integration communities</i>."

Because MC et al. define AIV as the VTA/SN projecting regions surrounding RA, it would seem that the AIV as so defined includes Ad? One portion of AIV that is lesioned by MC et al. also receives projections from NC and sends projections to VTA. Hence, this portion of AIV (which appears to make up a significant part of its bulk), shares some major defining characteristics with the similarly located Ad. I presume that this portion of AIV might be distinguished (as far as anatomy is concerned) by identifying a region from which LMAN-shell afferents are excluded? I am not sure whether the authors have examined this possibility, or can otherwise clarify this issue. However, the anatomy components of the study (especially as they relate to lesion locations and locations of neural recordings) require more clarification before the relationship between the current study and previous work can be understood and evaluated</i>."

For example, both studies include lesions that are several hundred microns lateral to the lateral most edge of RA, approximately at the depth of the center of RA (as well as more ventrally), and at approximately the R-C center of RA (as well as more rostrally and caudally). With the listed coordinates for both studies it would seem plausible if not likely that the two studies have lesioned overlapping brain regions. Additionally, MC et al. carry out separate control 'Ad' lesions (intended to test whether the reported effects could be due to lesions of Ad rather than AIV. However, the R-C and M-L locations of these Ad lesions (in MC et al.) fall into this same region lateral to RA. The D-V locations of these lesions are not provided, but instead the authors note that Ad lesions were made at depths that corresponded to the electrophysiologically defined boundaries of Ad. The authors should provide the D-V locations of Ad lesions, and some validation of the physiological criteria for defining the boundaries of Ad. I suppose that the authors' intent with their Ad lesions was to show that lesions restricted to the region lateral to RA (that may have been lesioned in both the 'AIV' lesions of CM et al. and the 'Ad' lesions of B&amp;A) are insufficient to elicit the behavioral deficits associated with the 'AIV' lesions. However, because the authors use a lower concentration (and volume) of NMA for their Ad lesions than for their AIV lesions (1% versus 2%) this argument needs to be bolstered with some careful analysis of histology to establish exactly what was destroyed in each experiment</i>."
