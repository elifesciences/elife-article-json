Spurred by the development of fast solid state cameras, wide-field methods such as wide-field microscopy (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ziv et al., 2013</a>), light-field microscopy (<a href=\"#bib43\">Prevedel et al., 2014</a>), and light-sheet microscopy (<a href=\"#bib25\">Holekamp et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ahrens et al., 2013</a>) have been used to measure neural activity. Scattering and out-of-focus fluorescence rapidly degrade signal and contrast when imaging in scattering tissue with wide-field methods compared to 2-photon microscopy (<a href=\"#bib38\">Peron et al., 2015</a>). As a consequence, at any point in the image, signals from multiple neurons are mixed together. Unmixing these signals to extract neural activity of individual neurons is a challenging computational problem, which remains unsolved in general. In contrast, the high resolution and image contrast provided by 2-photon microscopy allows extraction of fluorescence signals corresponding to the activity of individual neurons and subcellular compartments (<a href=\"#bib49\">Stosiek et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sato et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Akerboom et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Petreanu et al., 2012</a>)."

Simultaneous tracking of activity in these brain areas is not possible using standard microscopes, because mechanical movement of microscopes or specimens is slow. High-resolution microscopes have fields of view (FOV) that are smaller than most brain areas, whereas large FOV microscopes have small numerical apertures and cannot resolve individual neurons. To bridge the gap between single cells and brain regions we developed a mesoscale 2-photon microscope capable of imaging a FOV of 5\u2009mm, with subcellular resolution. We use the term \u2018mesoscale microscopy\u2019 to refer to imaging with subcellular resolution and fields of view spanning multiple brain areas (several millimeters)."

The fluorescence signal collected per unit time is ultimately limited by the average power that can be delivered to the specimen, which in turn is limited by heating. In the mouse brain the maximum allowed power is approximately <i>P</i><sub>max</sub> = 200 mW (<a href=\"#bib42\">Podgorski and Ranganathan, 2016</a>). The signal rate for one scanning beam is <i>S<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>a P</i><sub>max</sub><i><sup>2</sup></i>, where <i>a</i> is a parameter that depends on the illumination, the experimental preparation (e.g. the type and concentration of the fluorescent probe), and fluorescence detection. In another popular scheme the excitation beam is partitioned into <i>n</i> beams for multiplexed excitation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lecoq et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Okun et al., 2015</a>). Dividing the power into <i>n</i> laser foci for multiplexed imaging, the signal is <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> = <i>a n (P</i><sub>max</sub><i>/n)<sup>2</sup></i>. This division corresponds to reduced overall signal levels (by <i>1/n</i>) and a corresponding reduction in the number of neurons sampled, at fixed signal-to-noise ratio. Increasing the power of each individual beam beyond a total (summed) power of <i>P</i><sub>max</sub> = 200 mW would cause heating and associated damage. Given the relatively slow dynamics of calcium-related fluorescence (<a href=\"#bib39\">Peron et al., 2015</a>), serial scanning with a single laser focus maximizes the number of neurons that can be probed."

Stirman <i>et al</i> used a custom objective (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stirman et al., 2014</a>) with a field of view of 3.5\u2009mm. Neither system provides subcellular resolution in the axial dimension (14\u2009\u03bcm and 12\u2009\u03bcm, respectively), implying that signals from multiple neurons and neuropil may be conflated. In current implementations these instruments use standard galvo mirrors, which are too slow for some types of functional imaging. These microscopes also do not implement rapid axial scanning, which is critical for targeting specific neurons in different parts of the FOV. In addition, the microscopes are corrected for aberrations at only one excitation wavelength (800 nm and 910 nm respectively), limiting their use to a subset of fluorescent probes. A large FOV (5\u2009mm) mesolens for confocal microscopy, with numerical aperture 0.47, has also been reported (<a href=\"#bib34\">McConnell et al., 2016</a>)."

For example, it would be possible to image the primary somatosensory cortex, the primary motor cortex and parts of secondary motor cortex nearly simultaneously (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Second, the mesoscope should have better than cellular resolution, implying axial resolutions substantially smaller than the typical size of a soma (diameter, 10 \u00b5m) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Peters and Kaiserman-Abramof, 1970</a>). We specified a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.6, which translates to approximately 0.61 \u00b5m lateral resolution and 4.25 \u00b5m axial resolution (for \u03bb = 970 nm; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zipfel et al., 2003</a>). Third, the mesoscope should produce diffraction-limited performance and high two-photon excitation efficiency over the range of \u03bb = 900\u20131070 nm. This spectral range corresponds to fluorescent protein sensors based on GFP and various red fluorescence proteins (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akerboom et al., 2013</a>). Fourth, the mesoscope should maximize the collection of fluorescence signal, ideally with a large collection NA. We specified a collection NA of 1.0 (specifications list\u00a0in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Faster scanning provides better time resolution for measurements of neural activity, reduced photodamage, and tracking larger numbers of neurons. Rapid scanning methods rely on resonant scanning mirrors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fan et al., 1999</a>) or acousto optic deflectors (AODs) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Reddy and Saggau, 2005</a>), both of which have scan angles on the order of a few degrees, corresponding to relatively small (several hundred \u03bcm) scans in the specimen plane. To access the entire scan field rapidly we designed a lateral scan unit with multiple scanners in series. A fast resonant scan is moved over the specimen in a flexible manner using a galvanometer scanner, allowing rapid sampling of activity in widely dispersed brain regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

In most scanning microscopes, focusing is achieved by moving the objective. Because of the mechanical inertia of the bulky objective, focusing is more than two orders of magnitude slower than lateral scanning (<a href=\"#bib19\">G\u00f6bel et al., 2007</a>). This limit is unacceptable for mesoscale imaging because the structures of interest to be sampled in different brain regions are typically in focal planes that differ by up to several hundred micrometers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We addressed this problem by implementing a rapid remote focusing unit in which a light-weight mirror is moved instead of the objective (<a href=\"#bib6\">Botcherby et al., 2012</a>). Rapid remote focusing also allowed us to relax flatness of field specifications, because rapid focusing can partially correct for curved scan fields online."

The RF mirror is approximately conjugate to the focus in the specimen plane. Axial movement of the RF mirror changes the axial location of the focus in the specimen (scale factor, 1.23; i.e. a 100 \u00b5m move of the RF mirror causes a 123 \u00b5m move of the focus). Depending on the axial position of the RF mirror, the wavefront entering the imaging objective will be converging, parallel, or diverging. For standard microscope objectives, which obey the sine condition, only parallel rays will converge to a diffraction-limited point in the specimen (<a href=\"#bib5\">Born and Wolf, 1980</a>). Spherical wavefronts in the objective pupil will produce spherical aberration at the focus. Rays entering the objective back aperture at its periphery will focus to a different point along the axis, thereby producing a larger focal volume with lower peak intensity. These spherical aberrations degrade resolution and contrast. The RF objective was designed to counteract the spherical aberrations produced by the imaging objective, so that diffraction-limited imaging can be achieved throughout the microscope\u2019s imaging volume (<a href=\"#bib6\">Botcherby et al., 2012</a>). The imaging objective also has axial chromatic aberration that varies with RF depth, which is compensated by the RF objective. The RF unit allows rapid axial movement of the focal plane, since the RF mirror can be moved much faster than the objective or the specimen."

This condition is critical for optimal detection of precious signal photons. For most microscopes this condition is not an issue, as PMTs have photocathodes that are much larger than the objective FOV, as well as sizable collection angles (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tsai et al., 2002</a>). For the 2p-RAM the imaging objective collects emitted light with an NA of 1.0, and a collection FOV of 6\u2009mm (<a href=\"#bib36\">Oheim et al., 2001</a>). The diameter of the imaging objective pupil relevant for fluorescence detection is 42\u2009mm. The etendue of this collected emission light exceeds the etendue of the current state-of-the-art PMTs which have a photocathode diameter of 5\u2009mm and a usable NA of approximately 0.9 (unpublished measurements). This makes it impossible for all of the fluorescence light collected by the objective to be directed onto the PMT using conventional imaging schemes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mainen et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tsai et al., 2002</a>). To overcome this problem we used oil to directly couple a custom-made condenser lens to the glass enveloping the PMT. This allowed the collection NA of the PMT to reach 1.4. In this manner all of the fluorescence that is collected by the imaging objective is projected onto the PMT for detection (not counting reflection losses)."

As a result, the spatial distribution of the signal on the PMT photocathode varies with location of the signal source within the sample. The spot size of the projected light from a point source in the sample on the photocathode varies from 1.5\u2009mm to 2.7\u2009mm, depending on the location of the source point. The microscope image is therefore sensitive to inhomogeneities in the photosensitivity of the PMT photocathode. For the most critical applications it may be necessary to select PMTs with homogeneous photocathodes or employ computational methods to correct for the inhomogeneity."

The lateral FWHM of the bead image was 0.66 \u00b1 0.003\u2009\u03bcm (SEM) and the axial FWHM was 4.09 \u00b1 0.06\u2009\u03bcm (SEM). Approximately 2 millimeters from the center of the FOV, the resolution started to degrade gradually (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I,J,K</a>). At the edge of the FOV (2.5\u2009mm from the center) the lateral FWHM was 0.89 \u00b1 0.006\u2009\u03bcm (SEM), and the axial FWHM 6.88 \u00b1 0.07\u2009\u03bcm (SEM). At the center of the FOV, performance was diffraction-limited up to 1\u2009mm deep into the sample (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This performance was similar at different positions in the field and different imaging depths up to 1\u2009mm into the sample (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Resolution was consistent across wavelengths from 900 nm to 1040 nm (the limit of the tuning range of our Ti:Sapphire laser) (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Resolution also remained essentially unchanged for small (up to \u00b1 2.5\u00b0) tilts of the coverglass with respect to the beam axis (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We conclude that the 2p-RAM is capable of subcellular resolution over the entire imaging volume (\u2205\u00a05x1\u2009mm cylinder) and is robust to moderate misalignments."

The power entering the objective was measured with a high NA accepting power meter (Thor; S170C). Measurement was taken with the 460 \u00b5m spot in the center of the field. (<b>D</b>) Peak normalized ratio of the intensity measured by the PMT to the power entering the objective as a function of the NA of the light source (axis sampled non-uniformly).

For example, low magnification movies showed activity across multiple brain regions including somatosensory, parietal, and motor areas (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>; GP5.17 mice). We correlated the average activity from an area (region 1) in somatosensory cortex with activity in the rest of brain (<a href=\"#bib54\">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</a>)(<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>).

Individual neurons showed fluorescence transients corresponding to trains of action potentials (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). We manually segmented individual neurons in each of the regions and computed the change in fluorescence (\u0394F/F) over time (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). We measured average activity in region 1 by computing the maximum of the \u0394F/F traces across all neurons in that region at each time point. We then correlated this trace against all the \u0394F/F traces of individual neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,F</a>). Some neurons in the different areas showed high correlation with this average trace, whereas others showed uncorrelated activity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Okun et al., 2015</a>).

This is because neurons of interest will generally be at different imaging depths in different brain regions. It is also often of interest to interrogate the same brain region at different imaging depths. In the 2p-RAM, axial scanning is based on aberration-free focusing using a remote mirror (<a href=\"#bib6\">Botcherby et al., 2012</a>). The mirror is moved in a plane nearly conjugate to the specimen plane to move the focus. Aberrations are corrected by passing the beam through a RF objective that produces complimentary aberrations to the imaging objective. In published optical arrangements, the beam is scanned laterally first, and is then sent into the RF system (<a href=\"#bib6\">Botcherby et al., 2012</a>). This design puts constraints on the RF objective. In our system the beam is passed through the RF system before lateral scanning. This configuration allowed the etendue, and thus size, complexity, and cost, of the RF objective to be much lower than that of the imaging objective. We also optimized the coatings and the element count of the RF objective to minimize power losses that are normally high in remote focusing systems. The optics subsequent to the RF objective could be made such that the remote focusing is invariant to lateral scanning, and thus diffraction-limited focusing can be achieved over a large volume with this arrangement. Alternative axial scanning techniques, such as rapidly moving the objective (<a href=\"#bib19\">G\u00f6bel et al., 2007</a>), are impractical due to the large size of the 2p-RAM objective. Electrotunable lenses introduce spherical and chromatic aberrations (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grewe et al., 2011</a>)."

Rapid remote focusing can help to compensate for field curvature in real time during scanning. Online correction of field curvature can only be achieved for the movements produced by the slower galvo scanners. The movements of the resonant scanner are too fast to be fully compensated, because RF systems implemented with either galvos (<a href=\"#bib6\">Botcherby et al., 2012</a>), voice coils (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), or piezos (unpublished observations) cannot match the resonant scanning bandwidth. Fast resonant scan lines are by necessity tilted, which is more pronounced close to the edge of the FOV. For many in vivo applications the residual field curvature is expected to be only a small inconvenience, because neurons of interest in different brain areas are typically in different focal planes."

The low-magnification image can be used to optimally place these smaller imaging regions around the vasculature."

Mesoscale recording systems, such as 2p-RAM, allow recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas.

Such capabilities will open up a new generation of in vivo imaging experiments in rodents by allowing for studies of cortical brain activity (with subcellular resolution) over a large portion of the cortex. The manuscript is timely and the microscope design should prove useful for many exciting studies examining the relationship between activity patterns in microcircuits simultaneously in spatially separate brain regions during behavior. As the authors point out, their new microscope is capable of recording from a ~100 fold larger imaging volume compared to other two-photon microscopes with similar resolution."

For example, in the \"Optical Design\" section, the authors state that they will provide a detailed description of the optical designs elsewhere. This is confusing. Is there a more appropriate venue to publish such details other than the instrumentation paper presenting the microscope? Ideally, every element should be detailed (for a good example of appropriate level of detail, see Stirman and Smith 2014, 2015 bioRxiv), and at the very least, the designs for the custom optical components should be provided here. The authors should also comment on whether it is practical for others in the community to make such an instrument, or whether the cost is prohibitive."

Furthermore, it is not clear from the in vivo images how well signals from adjacent neurons (or neurons above/below each other) can be separated. For example, nuclear exclusion is not very clear in the figure images (contrary to what is stated in the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cin vivo imaging\u201d). Ideally, the authors would provide measurements of PSFs in vivo, provide better images (increased zoom) to see GCaMP nuclear exclusion, state explicitly that their PSF measurements are ex vivo and that in vivo PSFs will be larger, and preferably demonstrate signal separation between adjacent neurons."

If this power limit does not hold, does the authors\u2019 serial vs. multiplexed scanning argument hold?"

Is there a more appropriate venue to publish such details other than the instrumentation paper presenting the microscope? Ideally, every element should be detailed (for a good example of appropriate level of detail, see Stirman and Smith 2014, 2015 bioRxiv), and at the very least, the designs for the custom optical components should be provided here.

Furthermore, it is not clear from the in vivo images how well signals from adjacent neurons (or neurons above/below each other) can be separated.
