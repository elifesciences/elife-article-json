Deregulation of endothelial responses to flow-induced shear is believed to contribute to many aspects of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis. However, how molecular signals and shear-mediated physical forces integrate to regulate vascular patterning is poorly understood. Here we show that endothelial non-canonical Wnt signalling regulates endothelial sensitivity to shear forces. Loss of Wnt5a/Wnt11 renders endothelial cells more sensitive to shear, resulting in axial polarization and migration against flow at lower shear levels. Integration of flow modelling and polarity analysis in entire vascular networks demonstrates that polarization against flow is achieved differentially in artery, vein, capillaries and the primitive sprouting front. Collectively our data suggest that non-canonical Wnt signalling stabilizes forming vascular networks by reducing endothelial shear sensitivity, thus keeping vessels open under low flow conditions that prevail in the primitive plexus."

Deregulation of endothelial responses to flow-induced shear is believed to contribute to many aspects of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis. However, how molecular signals and shear-mediated physical forces integrate to regulate vascular patterning is poorly understood. Here we show that endothelial non-canonical Wnt signalling regulates endothelial sensitivity to shear forces. Loss of Wnt5a/Wnt11 renders endothelial cells more sensitive to shear, resulting in axial polarization and migration against flow at lower shear levels. Integration of flow modelling and polarity analysis in entire vascular networks demonstrates that polarization against flow is achieved differentially in artery, vein, capillaries and the primitive sprouting front. Collectively our data suggest that non-canonical Wnt signalling stabilizes forming vascular networks by reducing endothelial shear sensitivity, thus keeping vessels open under low flow conditions that prevail in the primitive plexus."

Throughout life, the forces that act on the blood vessels help to remodel the vessel network to ensure that blood gets to the parts of the body that need it. For example, the movement of blood across the surface of the endothelial cells that line the inside of the blood vessels applies a force called \u201cshear stress\u201d to the cells. The endothelial cells respond and adapt to the stress by altering their shape, patterns of gene activity and internal organization (known as their polarity)."

The model was then used to show that endothelial cells lacking non-canonical Wnt signalling are able to reorient and become polarized against the direction of blood flow at lower levels of shear stress. Thus, non-canonical Wnt signalling helps to raise the threshold of shear stress above which endothelial cells change their properties."

Vessel assembly and sprouting establish the major axial vessels and a primary network, which undergoes extensive remodelling to become functional. Also in the adult, vascular networks can be reactivated, expanded to meet changing metabolic demands, or remodelled, as a consequence of injury or local occlusion\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Carmeliet, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Potente et al., 2011</a>). A large number of mouse mutants have been described as having defects in vascular remodelling. Yet, in contrast to vascular sprouting, very little is known about the intrinsic cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling vascular remodelling. One aspect of remodelling is vessel segment regression, in which existing connections are lost. Endothelial cell (EC) death drives programmed regression of the ocular hyaloid vessels\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Lobov et al., 2005</a>) and pupillary membrane\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Meeson et al., 1999</a>). Whilst a similar mechanism was thought to be driving developmental vascular remodelling, recent reports proposed that vessel segment regression in the remodelling retinal blood vessels involves dynamic rearrangement of ECs, which actively migrate from regressing vessel segments to integrate into neighbouring vessels\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Franco et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Udan et al., 2013</a>). Chen et al. postulated that ECs in zebrafish brain vessels sense a threshold of low blood flow below which vessel regression is triggered irreversibly\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). Our recent rheology modelling of the retinal plexus also predict regression of poorly perfused vessel segments\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Bernabeu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Franco et al., 2015</a>), and demonstrated that EC axial polarization against the blood flow direction is a conserved feature in remodelling vessels\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Franco et al., 2015</a>). Our observations lead us to propose that flow-induced EC polarization directs migration of ECs that reside in low flow or oscillatory flow segments towards juxtapose high flow segments. As a consequence, this movement of ECs between vessel segments with differential flow regimes leads to regression of low-flow branches and stabilization of the higher flow segments\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Franco et al., 2015</a>). Blood flow is critical for vascular remodelling\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">Hahn and Schwartz, 2009</a>), but the relevance and the mechanistic understanding of how physical forces and signalling pathways collectively stabilize or disrupt vessel connections remains unknown."

We show that loss of endothelial-derived Wnt5a and Wnt11 sensitizes ECs to polarize against the blood flow direction at lower levels of wall shear stress, in vitro and in vivo, thereby leading to premature and excessive vessel regression in mouse. We postulate that the enhanced sensitivity to flow in non-canonical Wnt-deficient endothelium promotes earlier discrimination of flow asymmetries between neighbouring vessel segments in the capillary plexus, thus driving premature vessel regression and accelerated remodelling."

Tamoxifen-inducible <i>Wls</i> deletion in ECs (Pdgfb-iCreERT2::<i>Wls</i><sup>fl/fl</sup>, hereafter <i>Wls</i> iEC-KO) led to significantly decreased vascular density compared to littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Quantification revealed increased regression profiles (quantified by the Col.IV-sleeves and Icam2-breakage profiles), while sprout frequency, proliferation, EC density and apoptosis rates were unaffected (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>). Surprisingly, these results did not recapitulate recent findings by Korn et al. who reported that <i>Wls</i> iEC-KO causes increased vessel regression through increased apoptosis\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib25\">Korn et al., 2014</a>). Our recent work established that regression in the mouse vasculature follows a sequence of events that begin with vessel stenosis, followed by cell retraction that finally leads to resolution, leaving only empty matrix behind\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Franco et al., 2015</a>). The frequency distribution of regression profiles at these distinct stages of segment regression, i.e. stenosis, retraction or resolution, was similar in <i>Wls</i> iEC-KO and <i>Wls</i> WT mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>) indicating that the lack of secretion of Wnt ligands from ECs affects the frequency but not the mechanism of vessel regression. Experimental hyperoxia-induced vessel obliteration (which is driven by endothelial apoptosis\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Alon et al., 1995</a>) caused similar central capillary network dropout in <i>Wls</i> WT and <i>Wls</i> iEC-KO, suggesting that EC Wnt-ligands are not able to significantly protect from endothelial cell apoptosis-mediated vessel regression events (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,b</a>). Defects in pericyte recruitment have been linked to increased vessel instability and vessel regression\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Benjamin et al., 1998</a>). We analysed pericyte coverage using NG2 marker and observed no significant changes between <i>Wls</i> WT and <i>Wls</i> iEC-KO retinas (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a>)."

Also the tracheal vasculature, undergoing post-natal remodelling\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Baffert et al., 2004</a>), showed a significant decrease in vascular density in <i>Wnt5a</i> iEC-KO; <i>Wnt11</i> KO, and an associated increase in vessel regression events (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c,d</a>).

Further, we have developed a computational approach to simulate blood flow in retinal networks and calculate wall shear stress and flow patterns\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Bernabeu et al., 2014</a>). Given the known involvement of non-canonical Wnt signalling in Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) and cell polarization\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Devenport, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Segalen and Bellaiche, 2009</a>) we hypothesized that <i>Wls</i> iEC-KO could have defects in cell polarization. We therefore analysed if non-canonical Wnt signalling could influence coordinated polarization of ECs in vivo and in response to flow. We stained <i>Wls</i> iEC-KO and control mice for Golgi, lumen, and EC nuclei and extracted maps of axial polarity for entire retinal vascular networks\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Franco et al., 2015</a>), in a novel analysis methodology that we call hereafter Polarity Network (PolNet) analysis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To measure efficiency of endothelial polarization in response to flow, we calculated the angle between the axial polarity vectors and the predicted flow vectors (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). Similar to controls, <i>Wls</i> iEC-KO EC cells significantly polarize against blood flow direction across all assessed regions of the network (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>). Surprisingly, <i>Wls</i> iEC-KO ECs in capillaries, the regions of active remodelling, showed significantly better polarization against the blood flow compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a>). When plotting the percentage of cells polarized within 45 degrees of anti-parallel orientation to flow against the computationally predicted wall shear stress, WT and <i>Wls</i> iEC-KO cells segregated such that Wnt-deficient cells reached 60 percent of cells polarizing already at less than 4\u2009Pa whereas WT cells needed more than 7\u2009Pa of shear to reach 60 percent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7e</a>). These data suggest that loss of endothelial-derived non-canonical Wnt ligands substantially increases the sensitivity of cells to shear."

Below the threshold, ECs movements in the immature plexus are balanced by countermovements of adjacent ECs maintaining vessel connections, in a state of dynamic stability. When exposed to shear stress levels above the response threshold, ECs react by polarizing and migrating against the flow direction, triggering vessel regression and vessel remodeling. Signaling pathways influencing the threshold for flow-dependent EC polarization can delay remodeling (raising the threshold) or induce premature remodeling (lowering the threshold), as in the case of deficient non-canonical Wnt signaling."

We find no evidence for decreased EC proliferation, or increased EC apoptosis upon loss of <i>Wls</i> or <i>Wnt5a/Wnt11</i>, in both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experiments. Korn et al. used TNP-470 to inhibit non-canonical Wnt signalling, a compound which inhibits the broad-spectrum enzyme methionine aminopeptidase-2, and that has been suggested to also interfere with VEGF signalling, a major regulator of cell proliferation and survival\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib19\">Emoto et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sin et al., 1997</a>). Our study instead used selective genetic loss-of-function, potentially explaining some of the differences.

Interestingly, angiotensin II-treated wild-type animals showed similar levels of vessel regression as untreated <i>Wls</i> iEC-KO mice, and the same drug could further raise regression levels in <i>Wls</i> iEC-KO mice. This data further suggests that non-canonical Wnt signalling effects in vessel regression are indeed blood flow-dependent. But most importantly, it suggests the existence of a shear stress threshold for the onset of vessel regression. Our quantitative analysis combining EC axial polarity patterns and <i>in silico</i> flow simulations shows that with increasing shear more cells are polarized better, further advocating for the presence of a shear threshold. We propose that non-canonical Wnt signalling regulates this threshold. How mechanistically Wnt5a and Wnt11 controls this threshold remains unresolved. Interestingly, Martin Schwartz group showed that HUVECs have a defined threshold to polarize parallel to flow, and that VEGFR3 acts as a modulator of blood flow shear response by regulating the flow sensor VEGFR2/VEcadherin/Pecam1\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Baeyens et al., 2015</a>). Non-canonical Wnt signalling could interact with this pathway and thus impact on the flow shear stress sensor. However, our analysis demonstrated that Wnt5a and Wnt11-depleted HUVECs activate expression of key components in flow sensing (<i>Klf2, Klf4, Ptgs2</i>) in the same order of magnitude as control cells, suggesting that non-canonical Wnt signalling modulates the physical reorganization of cell polarity rather than flow sensing itself."

We propose that the primitive network before flow onset, or at a subthreshold level\u00a0of flow, is in a state of dynamic stability where the movement of cells is less directional, but balanced by countermovements of adjacent cells such that the network remains open and lumenised. In this context, non-canonical Wnt signalling is likely to facilitate coordinated EC behaviour balancing cell movements in low-flow segments. Flow-induced polarity will supersede this mechanism driving ECs to polarize against the flow direction. It is tempting to speculate that flow-independent cell rearrangements and flow-induced cell movements stand in some form of competition to each other. Whereas the balancing rearrangements act to maintain vessels open even under low-flow conditions, flow-induced polarization introduces a bias in the system that leads to stenosis and regression of low-flow vessel segments. Thus, one could assume that forces or signals that drive cells to maintain the vessel open need to be overcome by the flow induced polarization event. What drives the rearrangements of cells in the primitive plexus and how flow in one segment initiates regression in another is poorly understood."

However, given that Notch is also active in remodelling\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Ehling et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lobov et al., 2011</a>), VE-cadherin is a component of EC-to-EC and fluid shear stress force sensing\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Conway et al., 2013</a>), and that VE-cadherin is implicated in coordinating endothelial polarity in collective migration\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib44\">Vitorino and Meyer, 2008</a>), it is tempting to speculate that rearrangements in the primitive plexus involve Notch signalling as a driver of differences in cell motility, and that non-canonical Wnt works as a signalling pathway to balance net movements through coordination of cell cohesion, enabling symmetry of movements. Flow will break this symmetry in the primitive network as it provides an extrinsic directional signal that will polarize EC movements preferentially out of the low-flow segments and into the high-flow segments."

The local vessel diameters were calculated using maximum inscribed circles at multiple positions along each vessel segment and this information was used to construct a 3D model of the plexus\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Bernabeu et al., 2014</a>), code available at <a href=\"https://github.com/UCL/BernabeuInterface2014\">https://github.com/UCL/BernabeuInterface2014</a>). The surface defined by this model was used as the input to a Lattice Boltzmann Computational Fluid Dynamics solver, HemeLB (<a href=\"https://github.com/UCL/hemelb\">https://github.com/UCL/hemelb</a>), run on a High Performance Computing cluster. The raw fluorescence images were processed in MATLAB using the built-in 'Ginput' function to add points corresponding to the nucleus and Golgi of each cell and recording their locations. These positions defined a vector with magnitude and angle describing the spatial relationship between the points. Pairs of points were recorded for each cell, one at the center of the nucleus and one at the center of the Golgi, defining a vector with a magnitude and angle describing the spatial relationship between the points. The WSS values from the flow simulation were recorded at the positions of the cell nuclei, with the WSS at each point described by a vector giving the magnitude and angle of the applied shear stress. Each plexus was subdivided into artery, vein, capillary and sprouting front regions and each cell assigned to one of these vascular beds. The angular distributions were compared using the Kuiper test (the circular statistics equivalent of the Kolmogorov Smirnov test) with each comparison yielding a p-value indicating the likelihood that the two samples are drawn from the same underlying angular distribution. The calculation was performed using the Circular Statistics Toolbox from MATLAB\u2019s FileExchange\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib8\">Berens, 2009</a>). In addition we binned the angular data according to WSS magnitude to plot the proportion of cells within 45\u00b0 of being anti-aligned with the flow as a function of WSS. We calculated the scalar product of the two vectors, given by magnitude(cell polarity)*magnitude(WSS)*cos(theta) which combines information about the length and relative angles of the vectors. By plotting the scalar product versus WSS, we were able to extract a gradient corresponding to magnitude(cell)*cos(theta), i.e. the projection of the cell polarity vector onto the axis defined by the WSS vector. A larger negative gradient corresponds to a larger polarization effect for a given WSS."

Sprouting activity corresponds to the number of filopodia bursts, clusters of filopodia emanating from the leading edge, per field of view in 4\u20136 20x objective images of the sprouting front for each retina. Proliferation of endothelial cells was measure by quantifying the total number of endothelial cell nuclei (labeled by Erg immunostaining) positive for EdU staining in 3\u20135 20x objective images, in regions containing the sprouting front, and dividing by the total area of vascularized tissue.

Indeed, it could be that reduction of non-canonical Wnt signaling alters support from adjacent perivascular cells, which affects the response of endothelial cells to reduced flow. Along the same lines, angiotensin II might affect pericyte migration and it is not clear that its effect can be attributed exclusively to changes in blood flow (have the authors actually measured blood flows upon addition of angiotensin?)"

PLoS Biol 2015) illustrate that pericytes generally cover regressing vessels, and even are left behind when the endothelial cells have retracted. Nevertheless, we have now quantified pericyte coverage of retinal blood vessels from Evi WT and Evi iEC-KO. We observed no difference in terms of presence or distribution of pericytes in the KO mouse line. Additionally, it is important to note that the increased shear sensitivity of the endothelial cells in the absence of Wnt is present in the in vitro assay, which lacks pericytes (new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We are therefore confident the observed effects are endothelial cell-autonomous."

Pericyte migration is a very difficult aspect to analyze directly with currently available methods. The fact that pericytes are present all the way to the sprouting front in the mutant retinas, like in controls, strongly indicates however that there are no major pericyte migration defects. Animal models for direct dynamic visualization of pericytes in vivo are now becoming available, but retinal live imaging in development is not yet possible, and we lack the models to do this."

However, our current methodology did not allow us to obtain consistent and satisfactory measurements. We are currently investing into development of photoacoustic imaging to overcome this limitation, but until we get there, we will likely need another year. Thus, we cannot present quantitative information on this topic. Nevertheless, there are several papers presenting strong evidence that angiotensin II increases blood pressure (Timmermans et al. Pharmacol. Rev 1993; Gembardt et al. Faseb 2008)."
