High levels of sugar cause the concentration of a molecule called ATP \u2013 the energy currency of the cell \u2013 to increase inside cells. Ion channels known as K<sub>ATP</sub> channels sense changes in the levels of ATP to allow potassium ions to\u00a0move\u00a0out of beta cells, and thus\u00a0have a central role in regulating blood sugar levels (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ashcroft, 2005</a>). When ATP levels in the cell\u00a0are high, the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels close, and the resulting changes in the electrical excitability of the beta cell membranes lead to an increase in the release of insulin. Likewise, when blood sugar levels decrease, cellular ATP levels also drop, causing the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to open so that less insulin is released."

Drugs that close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to stimulate the release of insulin are widely used to treat type II diabetes, while drugs that open these channels are used to treat mild forms of hyperinsulinism. Now, in eLife, James Chen and Show-Ling Shyng and colleagues\u00a0at the Oregon Health and Science University \u2013 including Gregory Martin as first author \u2013 report that they have used electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the\u00a0structure of a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel in the closed state (<a href=\"#bib7\">Martin et al., 2017</a>). In independent work, Ning Gao, Lei Chen and colleagues at Peking University have used cryo-EM to determine the structure of a closed K<sub>ATP</sub> channel under different conditions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Li et al., 2017</a>)."

When blood sugar levels are low, another molecule called ADP along with magnesium ions (together known as MgADP) bind to the SUR1 subunits and the channels open. Other factors also regulate K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, such as the lipid PIP<sub>2</sub>, which opens the channel (<a href=\"#bib9\">Nichols, 2006</a>)."

The core of SUR1 contains two transmembrane domains (TMD1 and TMD2) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2), while the L0 linker contains two short \u03b1-helices. The Kir6.2 subunit is made of two transmembrane helices (dark green rectangle) and two cytoplasmic regions (light green rectangle). Martin et al. and Li et al. found that the center of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel propeller structure is formed by the Kir6.2 subunits and the TMD0 of SUR1.

The cryo-EM structures show that the SUR1 TMD0 interacts with the Kir6.2 pore. Thus, the cryo-EM structures\u00a0highlight how TMD0 is important in channel assembly, and explain why this SUR1\u00a0domain is a hot spot for mutations that cause hyperinsulinism (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aittoniemi et al., 2009</a>). An unexpected finding is that the SUR1 cores and Kir6.2 do not directly interact, even though the nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 (which bind to MgADP) are essential for opening the pore (<a href=\"#bib9\">Nichols, 2006</a>) and mutations affecting these domains cause disease (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aittoniemi et al., 2009</a>)."

The cryo-EM structures show that ATP, PIP<sub>2</sub>, and glibenclamide bind to regions of the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits, and hence explain why both types of subunits affect the action of these molecules. ATP binds to a site between the cytoplasmic regions of adjacent Kir6.2 subunits and a region of the\u00a0SUR1 L0 linker. PIP<sub>2</sub> binds to an adjacent site that also involves the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domains and the SUR1 L0 linker, while glibenclamide binds at a site made by a different region of the L0 linker and the core of SUR1."

Further structural studies will be needed to find out whether the twisted SUR1 core in the closed K<sub>ATP</sub> channel\u00a0is caused by glibenclamide binding to the channel, and to reveal how other drugs that open K<sub>ATP</sub> channels work."

Because these regions also bind to the L0 linker, it is possible that conformational changes in the nucleotide-binding domains may alter the structure of the L0 linker. Structural studies of the channels in the open state would shed more light on whether the L0 linker structure changes\u00a0and may reveal how mutations in Kir6.2 and SUR1 that disrupt the ability of the channel to close can cause diabetes. The exciting structures of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels reported by Martin et al. and Li et al. lay the foundation for finally answering many of these questions."
