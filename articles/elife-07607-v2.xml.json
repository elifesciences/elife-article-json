                    "text": "The enterococcal cytolysin is a virulence factor consisting of two post-translationally modified peptides that synergistically kill human immune cells. Both peptides are made by CylM, a member of the LanM lanthipeptide synthetases. CylM catalyzes seven dehydrations of Ser and Thr residues and three cyclization reactions during the biosynthesis of the cytolysin large subunit. We present here the 2.2 \u00c5 resolution structure of CylM, the first structural information on a LanM. Unexpectedly, the structure reveals that the dehydratase domain of CylM resembles the catalytic core of eukaryotic lipid kinases, despite the absence of clear sequence homology. The kinase and phosphate elimination active sites that affect net dehydration are immediately adjacent to each other. Characterization of mutants provided insights into the mechanism of the dehydration process. The structure is also of interest because of the interactions of human homologs of lanthipeptide cyclases with kinases such as mammalian target of rapamycin."

Both peptides are made by CylM, a member of the LanM lanthipeptide synthetases. CylM catalyzes seven dehydrations of Ser and Thr residues and three cyclization reactions during the biosynthesis of the cytolysin large subunit. We present here the 2.2 \u00c5 resolution structure of CylM, the first structural information on a LanM. Unexpectedly, the structure reveals that the dehydratase domain of CylM resembles the catalytic core of eukaryotic lipid kinases, despite the absence of clear sequence homology. The kinase and phosphate elimination active sites that affect net dehydration are immediately adjacent to each other. Characterization of mutants provided insights into the mechanism of the dehydration process. The structure is also of interest because of the interactions of human homologs of lanthipeptide cyclases with kinases such as mammalian target of rapamycin."

These peptides have lytic activity against various types of eukaryotic cells including immune cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cox et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bierbaum and Sahl, 2009</a>). The production of cytolysin enhances virulence in infection models of <i>E. faecalis</i>, and epidemiological data support an association with acute patient mortality (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ike and Clewell, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Huycke et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chow et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Van Tyne et al., 2013</a>). Cytolysin is a member of the lanthipeptides, a family of polycyclic peptides that are made in a two-step process involving dehydration of Ser and Thr residues to dehydroamino acids and subsequent addition of thiols of Cys residues to the dehydroamino acids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Knerr and van der Donk, 2012</a>). This process, catalyzed by the enzyme CylM for cytolysin, generates the characteristic thioether crosslinks called lanthionine (Lan) and methyllanthionine (MeLan) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). An N-terminal leader peptide in the substrates is important for substrate binding by lanthipeptide biosynthetic enzymes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Oman and van der Donk, 2010</a>), but the post-translational modifications take place in the C-terminal core peptides."

For the class I, III, and IV lanthipeptides, the mechanism of dehydration has been illuminated by crystallographic characterization of the dehydratases or close sequence homologs (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Goto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ortega et al., 2015</a>), but the mechanism of dehydration for class II lanthipeptide synthetases (LanMs) that include CylM has remained enigmatic. These enzymes show no clear sequence homology with non-lanthipeptide proteins and despite two decades of investigation, structural information on class II lanthipeptide synthetases has been unavailable. Such information would be valuable for obtaining inhibitors of cytolysin biosynthesis that could be therapeutically valuable. In addition, LanM lanthipeptide synthetases are involved in the biosynthesis of several lanthipeptides and their derivatives that are under clinical evaluation such as actagardine and duramycin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grasemann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Steiner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jones and Helm, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Johnson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Oliynyk et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Crowther et al., 2013</a>). As such, structural information on this class of synthetases will also facilitate bioengineering of improved analogs. We describe here the 2.2 \u00c5 resolution structure of CylM and demonstrate that its dehydration domain surprisingly has structural similarity with eukaryotic lipid kinases despite the absence of notable sequence homology. These findings may also have implications for the three eukaryotic homologs of lanthipeptide cyclases, one of which was recently shown to interact with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zeng et al., 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "To investigate the mechanism of catalysis, we determined the 2.2 \u00c5 resolution structure of CylM in complex with adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The structure of the \u223c110 kDa polypeptide consists of two distinct domains, with an N-terminal dehydration domain, composed of residues Asn4 through Pro624, and a C-terminal cyclization domain encompassed by Tyr641 through Glu992 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The protein is a monomer in the crystal and in solution as determined by gel filtration analysis. Consistent with prior predictions, the cyclization domain consists of the \u03b1/\u03b1-barrel fold observed in the structure of the stand-alone class I Lan cyclase NisC (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2006</a>). As in NisC, CylM contains a single zinc ion near the center of the toroid coordinated by residues Cys875, Cys911, and His912, with a water molecule completing the tetrahedral coordination geometry at the metal. This zinc site is believed to activate the thiols of the Cys residues during the cyclization reaction (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2006</a>). The barrel of the NisC structure is interspersed with a structural element that resembles eukaryotic peptide-binding domains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), which is thought to bind the leader region of the substrate peptide. The C-terminal cyclization domain of CylM lacks this element but instead contains a \u03b2-sheet region composed of three antiparallel strands that is situated near the zinc ion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, red). This element, encompassing Ile666 through Leu690, is located on the opposite face of the toroid relative to the putative leader peptide-binding domain in NisC, where it flanks against the base of the N-terminal dehydration domain of CylM. A similar antiparallel \u03b2-stranded element engages the leader peptide in the mechanistically unrelated class I Lan dehydratase NisB (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ortega et al., 2015</a>) and is also found in other enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Koehnke et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Burkhart et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Koehnke et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Thus, the leader peptide binding architecture may be conserved across RiPP biosynthetic enzymes, despite very high diversity of the reactions they catalyze (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arnison et al., 2013</a>). To investigate whether the \u03b2-stranded element in the cyclase domain is important for the dehydration reaction, the N-terminal domain (residues 1\u2013625) that lacks this element was expressed and purified with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag. Incubation with CylL<sub>S</sub> substrate resulted in efficient dehydration (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that the \u03b2-stranded element is not required for the dehydration reaction. This observation is consistent with several very recent reports describing expression and activity of the two individual domains of various LanM enzymes and binding of their substrates to both domains (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ma et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shimafuji et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yu et al., 2015</a>)."

A similar, but topologically distinct, four-helix bundle insertion (termed the FRB domain [<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 1995</a>]) cradles the N-lobe of PI3K-related protein kinases (PIKKs) such as, mTOR and DNA-PKc (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Choi et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sibanda et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yang et al., 2013</a>).

Kinase activity is typically controlled through activation-induced conformational changes, consisting of a disorder-to-order transition of the activation loop, which aligns active site residues and provides part of the binding site for substrate. Unlike most kinases, the activation loop in the CylM dehydration domain, composed of residues Asn365 through Val383, is well defined in the absence of bound peptide substrate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A, 3A</a>). The orientation and stabilization of the activation loop is established through numerous interactions with the LanM-specific KA domain, which is itself held in place through interactions with the \u2018capping helices\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A, 3A</a>). The activation loop is presumably stabilized in a catalytically competent conformation, because unlike most lipid kinases, the dehydration activity of LanM enzymes is not dependent on exogenous regulatory protein activators. The activation loop in mTOR is similarly held in a catalytically competent conformation via interactions with a highly conserved and integral \u223c35 residue FATC domain, which is stabilized through packing interactions with a \u223c40 residue insertion in the C-lobe termed the LBE (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yang et al., 2013</a>)."

The phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) is composed of residues Ser247 through Thr262 and is considerably longer than the equivalent feature in PI3Ks. It contains many residues that are poised to interact with the nucleotide phosphate, including Asp252 and His254. Mutational analysis suggests a second role for these residues in the elimination of phosphate from the phosphorylated peptide product (see below). The adenine is situated in a hydrophobic binding pocket common across other structurally characterized kinases that is defined by CylM residues Val272 (Ile831 in PI3K\u03b3), Val301 (Tyr867 in PI3K\u03b3), Ile354 (Met953 in PI3K\u03b3), and Val361 (Phe961 in PI3K\u03b3). The proposed mechanism for PIKKs involves a conserved DxH motif, and LanM-conserved residues Asp347 and His349 are poised for catalysis in CylM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). His349 may receive a proton from Ser/Thr in the substrate peptide (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miller et al., 2010</a>), in which case Asp347 likely orients the Ser/Thr oxygen for nucleophilic attack onto the \u03b3-phosphate of ATP. Alternatively, Asp347 could accept the proton from substrate (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). The invariant Lys residue that activates the \u03b3-phosphate in kinases (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hanks and Hunter, 1995</a>) is Lys274 in CylM. Additionally, two conserved residues, Asn352 and Asp364, are situated to act as divalent metal ligands to stabilize the incipient charge in the transition state, although slight reorientation of the side chain conformations must occur upon binding of the metal. A superposition of CylM with recent structures of the cyclin-dependent PIKK CDK2 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bao et al., 2011</a>) and mTOR (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yang et al., 2013</a>), each bound to transition state mimics, reveals a near-perfect coincidence of equivalent residues at the active site, underscoring their importance in catalysis (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

By way of comparison, prior studies established the kinetic parameters for the kinase domain of mTOR against the 4EBP1 peptide substrate yielding a <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> of 9.5 \u03bcM for ATP and <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> of 0.91 min<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tao et al., 2010</a>).

Previous mutagenesis studies identified four conserved residues in LanMs that are important for the phosphate elimination reaction (<a href=\"#bib57\">You and van der Donk, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ma et al., 2014</a>). Inspection of the CylM structure shows that these four residues (Asp252, His254, Arg506, and Thr512) are in close proximity to each other despite a separation of &gt;250 amino acids in primary sequence, and that they are situated in or immediately adjacent to the phosphorylation site (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Their importance was investigated using alanine substitution. Phosphorylated intermediates were detected for all four mutants, with partially dehydrated products observed for all except CylM-T512A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1\u20133</a>). Thus, all four residues are important for phosphate elimination. Asp252 and His254 are in the P-loop, which is thought to activate NTPs for attack during hydrolysis or substrate phosphorylation by interacting with the \u03b3-phosphate. The mutant phenotypes suggest that these residues may play a similar role of phosphate stabilization during the phosphate elimination reaction. Arg506 and Thr512 are located within the KA domain, suggesting that, in addition to stabilizing the activation loop, this domain also provides residues to assist in the elimination of phosphate. CylM thus offers insights into how an existing fold for an enzymatic activity (phosphorylation) can be adopted to carry out a second activity (elimination)."

In class I, the Ser and Thr side chain hydroxyl groups are activated by glutamylation in a glutamyl-tRNA-dependent process (<a href=\"#bib19\">Garg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ortega et al., 2015</a>). Class III and IV lanthipeptide synthetases are made up of separate Ser/Thr protein kinase, phosphoSer/phosphoThr elimination, and cyclase domains that are readily recognized by sequence homology (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goto et al., 2010</a>). The distinct phosphorylation and elimination domains in these latter enzymes require the phosphorylated peptides to translocate from the kinase to the lyase active site, accounting for the observation of phosphorylated intermediates (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jungmann et al., 2014</a>). The adjacency of the phosphorylation and elimination active sites in CylM provides an explanation for the lack of observed phosphorylated substrate peptides as intermediates in LanM catalysis if elimination occurs faster than peptide dissociation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Thibodeaux et al., 2014</a>)."

The purified phosphorylated peptides were then incubated with wild-type CylM. Without addition of nucleotides, CylM did not eliminate the phosphates. However, when ADP or ADP analogs were supplied, the phosphorylated peptides were converted to dehydrated CylL<sub>S</sub> peptides (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). Collectively, our results are consistent with an ordered kinetic mechanism in which ADP needs to bind before the phosphorylated peptide or in which the presence of ADP within the active site increases the affinity for phosphorylated peptide intermediates. The results are also consistent with processive phosphorylation and elimination steps since ADP present in the active site from the phosphorylation reaction is required for the phosphate elimination reaction."

                                "text": "The unexpected structural homology of bacterial LanM proteins with eukaryotic lipid kinases may also have implications for the function of three mammalian LanC-like (LanCL) proteins (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chung et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sturla et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). LanC proteins are stand-alone Lan cyclases such as NisC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Both LanCL1 and LanCL2 bind glutathione (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chung et al., 2007</a>), with the thiol of glutathione coordinating the conserved zinc site in LanCL1 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). Hence, the human proteins also appear to activate a thiol, like the LanC proteins and the homologous C-terminal domains of the bacterial LanM enzymes. Although the precise functions of LanCL proteins are currently still unresolved, human LanCL1 has been shown to be important for antioxidant activity that is key to neuronal survival (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, recent studies indicated regulation of and physical interactions between the human LanCL2 and the kinases Akt and mTORC2 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zeng et al., 2014</a>). The structure of CylM shows that its LanC domain interacts with the activation loop and the k\u03b111 helix of the kinase domain. These observations provide a platform to further investigate the intermolecular interaction of LanCL proteins with mammalian kinases, such as mTOR, that have structural homology with the CylM kinase domain."

                                "text": "The structural and biochemical analysis of the lanthipeptide synthetase CylM provided here presents the first molecular picture for installation of the thioether crosslinks in the large family of class II lanthipeptides. Leader-dependent binding of the substrate would template movement of the core peptide between the dehydration and cyclization domains. The immediacy of the phosphorylation and phosphate-elimination sites allows for both reactions to occur in a processive manner to yield the dehydroamino residue, which can then be consigned to the cyclization domain for subsequent Michael-type addition reaction. The ordered activation loop in CylM precludes the need for an activation-induced conformational change, observed for other lipid kinases, as binding of the substrate is dictated largely by the leader sequence (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abts et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Thibodeaux et al., 2015</a>). The structure of the CylM protein now allows installation of probes to monitor the movement of the substrates between the two active sites in LanM proteins to better understand the substantial motions of the substrate peptides during catalysis (<a href=\"#bib51\">Thibodeaux et al., 2014</a>). In addition, it facilitates inhibitor design to prevent biosynthesis of the cytolysin virulence factor in pathogenic <i>E. faecalis</i>, one of the causative agents of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections (<a href=\"#bib53\">Van Tyne et al., 2013</a>)."

Since the phosphorylated peptides carried only 1\u20133 phosphate esters, the additional dehydrations resulted from conversion of non-phosphorylated Ser/Thr to Dha/Dhb.

Similarly, 200, 100, 50, and 25 \u00b5M series (25 \u00b5l each) were prepared. To each sample, 25 \u00b5l of the ADP-Glo Reagent was added and incubated for 40 min, followed by the addition of 50 \u00b5l of ADP-Glo Max Detection Reagent and incubation for 1 hr. All samples were then transferred into a white 96 well plate and the luminescence was measured by a plate reader. Standard curves (25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 \u00b5M series) were created to correlate the ADP concentration with the luminescence."

Control reactions were set up with all other components in the absence of CylM. Reactions were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1, 2, 3, and 4 min before being stopped by adding 25 \u00b5l of ADP-Glo Reagent, which depletes the remaining ATP. After incubation for 40 min, ADP-Glo Max Detection Reagent (50 \u00b5l) was then added, the samples were incubated for 1 hr, and the luminescence was measured. ADP production in each sample was calculated by applying the corresponding standard curve. The curve of ATP consumption of CylM against ATP concentration was fitted using OriginPro 2015. All reactions were carried out in duplicate."

The reviewers have also provided some useful comments for you to consider during revision. Specifically, they struggled to visualize the structural relatedness between CylM and lipid kinases as presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. It therefore seems important for you to improve this section of the manuscript and its presentation. In complementary ways, both reviewers also raised concerns about whether CylM truly exhibits kinase-like activities that would support the claim that structural homology implies functional homology. The reviewers have suggested some specific experiments to address this point, as well as to test whether the role of ADP in the CylM mechanism might be more than just structural. Hopefully, you can perform these additional experiments to more directly evaluate the kinase-like functions of CylM and the potential role of the ADP product in the second phosphate elimination step. Some of the specific comments of the reviewers are included below."

The authors reveal that the enzyme contains a dehydratase domain that shares homology with lipid kinases. The authors provide a strong rationale for how the enzyme carries out a concerted phosphorylation, and elimination reaction. The van der Donk laboratory has a strong background in the study of these enzymes, and this structural work provides a strong underpinning to much of both theirs and others\u2019 work in the field. The work is overall of high quality. However, there are a few points that need to be addressed before the work is ready for publication."

The solubility of the substrate does not allow determination of its kinetic constants, but the kinetic parameters varying the ATP concentration are of the same magnitude of what were reported for the kinase domain of mTOR in the presence of the 4EBP1 peptide substrate. We felt that that was the best kinase for comparison since it is a lipid kinase-like enzyme but its substrates are proteins/peptides (like CylM)."

Of course, the enzyme catalyzes more than just the phosphorylation (also elimination and cyclization) and it does so at multiple sites on its substrate. Hence, a detailed comparison with dedicated protein kinases is not readily accomplished. Nevertheless, the ordered loop observed in CylM does not seem to accelerate ATP hydrolysis significantly with this particular set up. We appreciate the suggestion of performing such an experiment."

When ADP was used to investigate the ability to eliminate the phosphates (as we described, no elimination is observed in the absence of nucleotides) elimination was observed, but the number of net dehydrations exceeded the number of initial phosphorylations. This is because new phosphorylations and eliminations were catalyzed by CylM in the presence of ADP. This unexpected observation complicated the outcome and made data interpretation difficult. For example, when ADP was supplied instead of non-hydrolyzable ADP using a similar set up, only fully dehydrated CylL<sub>S</sub> could be observed after incubation. We added new data in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 2</a> to illustrate this. Therefore, to study the elimination reaction in isolation, non-hydrolyzable ATP and ADP analogues were employed to minimize the effect resulted from CylM-catalyzed phosphorylation."

We did leave in a discussion of the previously observed interaction between mTORC1 and LanCL1, since it was found well before the structure of CylM was determined.
