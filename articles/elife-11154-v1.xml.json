There has been remarkable evolutionary adaptation of this machine through the addition of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins whose individual effects on ribosome function are largely unknown. Here we show that eukaryote-specific Asc1/RACK1 is required for efficient translation of mRNAs with short open reading frames that show greater than average translational efficiency in diverse eukaryotes. <i>ASC1</i> mutants in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> display compromised translation of specific functional groups, including cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and display cellular phenotypes consistent with their gene-specific translation defects. Asc1-sensitive mRNAs are preferentially associated with the translational \u2018closed loop\u2019 complex comprised of eIF4E, eIF4G, and Pab1, and depletion of eIF4G mimics the translational defects of <i>ASC1</i> mutants. Together our results reveal a role for Asc1/RACK1 in a length-dependent initiation mechanism optimized for efficient translation of genes with important housekeeping functions."

There has been remarkable evolutionary adaptation of this machine through the addition of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins whose individual effects on ribosome function are largely unknown. Here we show that eukaryote-specific Asc1/RACK1 is required for efficient translation of mRNAs with short open reading frames that show greater than average translational efficiency in diverse eukaryotes. <i>ASC1</i> mutants in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> display compromised translation of specific functional groups, including cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and display cellular phenotypes consistent with their gene-specific translation defects. Asc1-sensitive mRNAs are preferentially associated with the translational \u2018closed loop\u2019 complex comprised of eIF4E, eIF4G, and Pab1, and depletion of eIF4G mimics the translational defects of <i>ASC1</i> mutants. Together our results reveal a role for Asc1/RACK1 in a length-dependent initiation mechanism optimized for efficient translation of genes with important housekeeping functions."

Recruitment of prokaryotic ribosomes to mRNAs requires only three initiation factors, IF1, 2, and 3, and relies on base-pairing between the RNA of the small ribosomal subunit and the anti-Shine-Delgarno sequence of the mRNA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Boelens and Gualerzi, 2002</a>). In contrast, translation initiation in eukaryotes requires at least 12 initiation factors and proceeds by a complex series of steps beginning with recognition of the mRNA 5\u2032 cap structure, followed by unwinding of mRNA secondary structure, recruitment of the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, scanning, recognition of the initiation codon, and finally, joining of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit to form a functional ribosome (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aitken and Lorsch, 2012</a>). Although the eukaryotic ribosome is generally considered to be a passive player during canonical initiation, several of its proteins have been implicated in mRNA recruitment. For example, RPL38 is required for the translation of the Hox body-patterning genes during embryonic development, allowing spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression through translational control (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kondrashov et al., 2011</a>). Other proteins including RPS25, RPL40, and RACK1 are essential for the translation of viral mRNAs that are recruited to the ribosome via alternative initiation pathways (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cherry et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Landry et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Majzoub et al., 2014</a>)."

In addition to its function as a core ribosomal protein, in mammalian cells, RACK1 has been found in complex with several proteins involved in signal transduction including protein kinase C, Src kinase, and cAMP phosphodiesterase, among many others (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2011</a>). The location of RACK1 on the ribosome together with its interactions with signaling proteins suggests a possible role in conveying stimulus-dependent information to the translation machinery (<a href=\"#bib58\">Nilsson et al., 2004</a>). However, signaling pathways in yeast and human have diverged significantly compared to genes required for ribosomal function (<a href=\"#bib74\">Stuart et al., 2003</a>), suggesting that RACK1 might have another, more conserved function during translation."

We show that Asc1 is required for the efficient translation of short mRNAs, including those encoding cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. This requirement is specific as deletion of other ribosomal proteins does not cause similar translation defects. Using translational reporters we demonstrate that length per se determines translational sensitivity to Asc1, thus confirming a role for Asc1 in the translational privileging of short mRNAs, which is a dominant trend in genome-wide translational efficiency data from diverse eukaryotes. Remarkably, mRNA enrichment with proteins that mediate the formation of a \u2018closed loop\u2019 during translation \u2014 eIF4E, eIF4G, and Pab1 \u2014 is strongly biased towards short mRNAs and predicts Asc1-sensitivity, suggesting a role for Asc1 in closed-loop-dependent ribosome recruitment. Consistent with this prediction, we find that depletion of the central closed loop factor eIF4G mimics the translational effects of mutating <i>ASC1</i>. Finally, we show that loss of <i>ASC1</i> reduces mitochondrial translation and renders cells unable to use alternative carbon sources that require enhanced mitochondrial function, demonstrating the functional significance of translational perturbation in <i>ASC1</i> mutants. Together, our results reveal a role for Asc1 in the enhanced translation of short mRNAs and establish a direct connection between gene-specific effects of Asc1 on translation and defects in cellular physiology. Furthermore, because mitochondria are essential for energy generation and regulation of many cellular networks, our results suggest that the pleiotropic phenotypes associated with the Asc1/RACK1 protein should be re-examined in the context of mitochondrial health."

In addition, Asc1/RACK1 may have functions off the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib9\">Baum et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Coyle et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Warner and McIntosh, 2009</a>). We therefore created an allelic series of yeast mutants with altered Asc1 function to enable direct comparison of cellular and translational effects of Asc1/RACK1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We created protein null alleles by mutating a codon early in the <i>ASC1</i> ORF to a stop codon (<i>asc1-M1X</i> and <i>asc1-E5X</i>, where X denotes a stop codon), which abolished Asc1 protein expression but maintained wild\u00a0type levels of <i>SNR24</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Although bulk polysomes appeared normal in these strains, both <i>asc1\u2206</i> and <i>asc1-M1X</i> showed reduced levels of free 60S subunits (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This slight discrepancy between our results and the literature (<a href=\"#bib50\">Li et al., 2009</a>) may stem from differences in strain backgrounds because the Sigma1278b strain used here has higher free 60S subunit levels than S288C. Restoring <i>SNR24</i> expression rescued the temperature-sensitive polysome defect of the <i>asc1\u2206</i> mutant in agreement with previous observations (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Li et al., 2009</a>). Both <i>asc1-M1X</i> and <i>asc1\u2206</i> grow slowly under standard laboratory conditions, whereas a mutant lacking only snR24 grows as well as wild type, further demonstrating the importance of the Asc1 protein (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>)."

These findings suggest that either Asc1 primarily affects translation from a location off the ribosome, or that the ribosome-binding assay underestimates the extent of in vivo association of the D109Y and DE mutant proteins because ribosome-bound factors can dissociate during ultracentrifugation (<a href=\"#bib80\">Val\u00e1sek et al., 2007</a>). To test this second possibility, we performed formaldehyde crosslinking before ultracentrifugation.

These ORF length reporters contain either one or eight repeats of the I27 domain from the human cardiac protein titin, which has been used extensively in studies of protein folding because the small globular domains fold and unfold independently of each other (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hoffmann and Dougan, 2012</a>). This modular architecture allows the construction of proteins of different lengths that resemble linear chains and minimizes the potential for differential protein folding or stability to impact the abundance of the reporter proteins. We performed quantitative Western blotting by fluorescent detection of a common C-terminal epitope tag in combination with qRT-PCR measurements of mRNA levels to determine the translational efficiency (protein/mRNA) of each construct (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Remarkably, the translational efficiency of the short ORF (~300 nt) was two-fold lower in the <i>asc1-M1X</i> mutant compared to the long ORF (~2400 nt) (p=0.002, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Together with the genome-wide trend, these reporter results demonstrate a role for Asc1 in the translational advantage of short mRNAs.

To test this prediction, we analyzed data quantifying the association of specific mRNAs with the closed\u00a0loop factors and the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) by RNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing (<a href=\"#bib17\">Costello et al., 2015</a>). We grouped mRNAs into \u2018closed loop\u2019, \u2018strong closed loop\u2019, and \u2018other\u2019 categories based on the following enrichment profiles: \u2018Strong closed loop\u2019 mRNAs are enriched in immunoprecipitations of eIF4E, eIF4G, and Pab1, and de-enriched in immunoprecipitations of the 4E-BPs, which should not be associated with mRNAs in closed loops because 4E-BPs and eIF4G compete for binding to eIF4E (<a href=\"#bib34\">Haghighat et al., 1995</a>). \u2018Closed loop\u2019 mRNAs have similar enrichment profiles to \u2018strong closed loop\u2019 mRNAs, but are not de-enriched for association with the 4E-BPs. Remarkably, we found that both \u2018closed loop\u2019 and \u2018strong closed loop\u2019 mRNAs were dramatically shorter than other mRNAs (median ORF lengths= 489, 774, and 1694 nt for \u2018strong closed loop\u2019, \u2018closed loop\u2019, and \u2018other\u2019 mRNAs, respectively). This association between ORF length and closed loop association was observed regardless of whether mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins were included in the analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>). Thus, although ~30% of the \u2018strong closed loop\u2019 mRNAs encode ribosomal proteins, a specialized mechanism for enhancing the translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs cannot explain the ORF length bias of the \u2018strong closed loop\u2019 group. This discovery \u2014 that closed-loop-associated mRNAs are much shorter than other mRNAs \u2014 provides a plausible biochemical explanation for the preference for higher translation efficiency of mRNAs with short ORFs observed here and previously (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arava et al., 2003</a>).

Using gene ontology analysis, we found that transcripts annotated to the category \u2018ribosomal subunit\u2019 had significantly decreased TE in the <i>ASC1</i> null mutants (<i>asc1-M1X</i>, p=10<sup>\u201335</sup>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). This category is composed of short mRNAs encoding both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (RPs, MRPs), which both displayed ~20% decreased TE in <i>ASC1</i> null mutants (<i>asc1-M1X</i>, p=10<sup>\u201337</sup> and p=10<sup>\u201310</sup>; <i>asc1\u2206</i>, p=10<sup>\u201335</sup> and p=10<sup>\u201310</sup>, respectively, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). As the median RP and MRP ORF lengths are 434 and 716 nt, respectively, their translational defects are within the range predicted by their length. Indeed, removing RP and MRP genes does not significantly alter the global relationship between \u2206TE and ORF length in <i>asc1-M1X</i> (r=0.23, p=10<sup>\u201358</sup>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) indicating that all classes of genes with short ORFs have decreased TE in <i>asc1-M1X.</i> Although these GO categories were the clear outliers, most GO categories with short median ORF lengths also displayed decreased TE in the <i>ASC1</i> null mutants, including several additional groups of genes whose protein products function in mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Because short ORF length is associated with specific functional categories, loss of Asc1 \u2014 and, potentially, modulation of its activity \u2014\u00a0leads to coherent changes in gene expression."

In support of this interpretation, qRT-PCR analysis of polysome gradient fractions demonstrated that representative MRP mRNAs associated with fewer ribosomes in <i>asc1-M1X</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>), which specifically indicates a defect in translation initiation. Because inhibiting translation initiation can induce mRNA degradation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Coller and Parker, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">LaGrandeur and Parker, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Schwartz and Parker, 1999</a>), decreased translation may account for the reduction in total mRNA levels although we cannot exclude the possibility of transcriptional effects or translation-independent effects of Asc1 on mRNA stability. We note that our translation efficiency measurements are correlated with steady-state mRNA half-life estimates using non-invasive metabolic labeling approaches (r=0.43, p=10<sup>\u2013194</sup>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, data from <a href=\"#bib55\">Miller et al., 2011</a> and r=0.39, p=10<sup>\u2013168</sup>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, data from <a href=\"#bib57\">Neymotin et al., 2014</a>), consistent with the hypothesis that the decay rates of mRNAs are coupled to their translational status.

If decreases in translation efficiency were caused by defects in no-go decay stabilizing mRNAs, thus inflating the denominator in the footprint RNA/total RNA calculation, then the levels of affected mRNAs should increase in the total RNA pool.

We therefore considered the possibility that reduced translation of these mRNAs might be a general consequence of perturbing the ribosome. To assess the specificity of the translational phenotypes of <i>ASC1</i> null mutants, we tested four additional ribosomal protein mutants, <i>rpl23b\u2206 rpp1a\u2206, rps0b\u2206</i>, and <i>rps16b\u2206</i>, each of which deletes one paralog encoding a core ribosomal protein. Like <i>asc1-M1X, rpl23b\u2206</i> and <i>rpp1a\u2206</i> show reduced growth on glucose and decreased 60S subunit levels (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). <i>RPS0B</i> and <i>RPS16B</i> encode small ribosomal subunit proteins that bind the ribosome near the mRNA exit channel in the vicinity of Asc1/RACK1 and deletion of these loci results in increased 60S subunit levels relative to 40S levels (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). However, none of the tested ribosomal protein mutants showed notable similarity to <i>asc1-M1X</i> in their translational dysregulation genome-wide (r= -0.06 to 0.18, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>), and they did not display decreased translation efficieny of \u2018closed loop\u2019 mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Because the growth and bulk translation phenotypes of these other ribosomal protein mutants are more severe than <i>asc1-M1X</i>, any shared defects in gene-specific translation should have been readily detected. Thus, decreased translation of RP genes is not a general feature of slow-growing mutants, ribosomal subunit imbalance, or perturbations in the vicinity of the mRNA exit channel near RACK1."

In particular, the requirement of Asc1 for efficient MRP translation suggested the possibility of impaired mitochondrial function in <i>ASC1</i> mutants. To assess mitochondrial health, we measured growth on the non-fermentable carbon source glycerol, which requires the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to generate energy (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dimmer et al., 2002</a>). When shifted to glycerol-containing media, wild\u00a0type yeast resumed rapid growth after an initial adaptation phase, but the <i>asc1-M1X</i> mutant completed only ~3 doublings before ceasing growth (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In contrast, the <i>rpl23b\u2206</i> and <i>rpp1a\u2206</i> mutants grew better in glycerol than <i>asc1-M1X</i>, demonstrating the specificity of this phenotype (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Consistent with our results, a proteomic survey of <i>asc1\u2206</i> cells showed a shift away from respiration and towards fermentative metabolism (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rachfall et al., 2012</a>). Because mitochondrial ribosomes are required for mitochondrial biogenesis and function, it is plausible that the growth and metabolic defects of <i>ASC1</i> mutants are consequences of the translation defects observed for MRP genes."

Adaptation to growth in non-fermentable carbon sources or low glucose is accompanied by a rewiring of the transcriptional network in yeast (<a href=\"#bib27\">Galdieri et al., 2010</a>) and widespread reprogramming of translation (<a href=\"#bib78\">Vaidyanathan et al., 2014</a>). To investigate whether the glycerol growth defect of <i>asc1-M1X</i> is linked to inadequate translational adaptation, we examined translation genome-wide 6\u2009hr after transfer from glucose to glycerol, a point just before the resumption of rapid growth in wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and coincident with the recovery of polysomes after the initial collapse upon glucose withdrawal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In the <i>asc1-M1X</i> mutant, polysomes recovered only partially (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Moreover, the ribosome-associated pool was strongly depleted of MRP mRNAs compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). However, the magnitude of translational defect (\u0394TE) for this class of mRNAs was similar in both glucose and glycerol, supporting a constitutive rather than regulatory role for Asc1 in translation of MRP mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The fact that <i>asc1-M1X</i> shows a bulk translation defect in glycerol but not in glucose may reflect the fact that MRP mRNAs make up a larger portion of the translatome in glycerol. Thus, the cellular context is an important factor in determining the phenotypic consequences of translational perturbations in <i>asc1-M1X</i> and likely in other ribosomal protein mutants as well. Taken together, our results suggest an important role for Asc1 in supporting cellular respiration by promoting synthesis of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins."

Given the central role of mitochondria in energy and metabolite production in eukaryotic cells, it is not surprising that mitochondrial defects elicit pleiotropic consequences (<a href=\"#bib13\">Calvo and Mootha, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fleming et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kushnir et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Shoffner et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Vafai and Mootha, 2012</a>). In light of our findings, many of Asc1/RACK1\u2019s ascribed cellular functions should be re-evaluated for potential connections to mitochondrial dysfunction.

Selective precipitation was used to enrich for small RNA fragments prior to size selection of 28mers on denaturing gels.

The eluate was brought to 70% ethanol to precipitate small RNAs. Total RNA for accompanying RNA-seq samples was isolated from the same cell extracts used for footprint library generation using the hot acid phenol method. Poly(A) selection was performed using oligo-dT cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich or NEB, Ipswich, Massachusetts) as previously described (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sambrook et al., 2001</a>). For experiments using rRNA-depletion to enrich for coding transcripts, the Ribo-Zero kit (Epicentre, Madison, Wisconsin) was used.

The one reporter you analyzed where the coding sequence length was varied systematically was considered a creative approach, but the results obtained were not very compelling. Suggestions were offered for a different kind of reporter analysis, where a native long mRNA would be systematically shortened, and to examine protein synthesis of a panel of native mRNAs representing Asc1-dependent versus independent genes to confirm the interpretations of the ribosome-profiling data for authentic mRNAs. You could extend the analysis in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> to include additional Asc1-dependent mRNAs, and also include Asc1 independent mRNAs, but it might be difficult to detect changes in polysome distribution for short mRNAs, in which case measurements of protein and mRNA synthesis or reporter expression would be required. I recall that in our paper on eIF4G depletion (Park et al), which you used creatively in your analysis, we validated a number of mRNAs as being eIF4G-dependent or -independent, and perhaps some of these mRNAs that are short and enriched for both eIF4G and PABP occupancy could be analyzed in your strains to achieve stronger validation of your ribosome profiling data."

There was general agreement among the reviewers during the consultation session that you should attempt to bolster your model by showing that an existing eIF4G mutation known to disrupt the closed loop mRNP would dampen the effects of eliminating Asc1 on translational efficiency of Asc1-dependent mRNAs or reporters. As these eIF4G mutations were made in the S288C background, such experiments would also address a concern that your study employed the Sigma background, which is rarely employed in studies on gene expression. A related point is that, without demonstrating that elimination of at least one other 40S protein in the vicinity of Asc1 on the solvent-exposed surface of the 40S subunit does not have the same effects on TE you observed on elimination of Asc1, it is dangerous to conclude that Asc1 is specifically dedicated to this regulatory function."

I think it is important to carefully consider these criticisms to avoid \"muddying the waters\" concerning the involvement of Asc1 in ribosome biogenesis."

It is important to consider this possibility and more fully document the effects of eliminating Asc1 on mRNA levels and the extent to which changes in TE might be driven by defects in no-go decay."

As short mRNAs tend to be the most efficiently translated, Asc1 is thus particularly important for the group of most highly translated mRNAs in the cell. Analysis of synthetic reporter constructs in which mRNA length was progressively increased suggests that short length per se confers an increased dependence on Asc1; however, unfortunately the data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> have a lot of variance and the results are significantly different only for the longest and shortest mRNAs in the series of constructs. As it was shown previously by Jacobson that short mRNAs can more readily form the closed-loop intermediate in vitro, they attempt to explain the Asc1-dependence of short mRNAs by analyzing a published data set on eIF4G and PABP binding to yeast mRNAs and find that (in WT cells) short mRNAs are indeed enriched in the mRNA classes with high occupancies of both proteins and thus likely to form the closed-loop mRNP intermediate. These mRNAs are also particularly dependent on Asc1, but I think that this would be expected from the finding that short mRNAs are Asc1-dependent. They claim to have shown that Asc1-dependence of the \"strong\" closed-loop category can be functionally separated from the Asc1 dependence of short mRNAs, but it's not clearly explained how they accomplished this, nor whether it can be done convincingly with only bioinformatics. They conclude that Asc1 is either important for closed-loop formation, or for the enhanced translation (ribosome recruitment?) of mRNAs in the closed-loop configuration. They finish by showing that the reduced translation of short mRNAs encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins is associated with a growth defect of <i>asc1</i> cells in non-fermentable carbon sources where mitochondrial function is important. However, they do not show directly that mitochondrial protein synthesis is impaired in <i>asc1</i> cells and it seems that they cannot rule out effects on expression of other genes required for growth in nonfermentable carbon sources."

However, since short mRNAs are enriched for both closed-loop formation potential and for dependence on eIF4G, it isn't entirely clear whether it is length per se, ability to form the closed loop, or dependence on eIF4G that confers the greater than average requirement for Asc1 for efficient translation."

(Tarun and Sachs showed in 1997 that the entire N-terminus of eIF4G1 can be deleted in a strain lacking eIF4G2 with only moderate effects on cell growth.) Their model strongly predicts that the effect of deleting Asc1 on translation of short, \"strong closed-loop mRNAs\" will be substantially dampened in this eIF4G1 mutant."

While the \u03a31278b strain is widely used for studies into filamentous growth in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> it is quite rarely used outside this, and it has some odd characteristics that raise concerns over the generality of the results shown. As has been shown previously on a number of occasions and is now shown in the polysomes presented here, \u03a31278b is very unusual in that it has abnormally high levels of free 60S subunits. The <i>asc1</i> null has previously been shown to decrease 60S subunit levels and again the authors reconfirm this observation. The authors state that the <i>ASC1</i> mutants have relatively subtle effects on protein synthesis and make statements about how subtle effects on translation as judged by polysome profiling can conceal a wider perturbation of cellular translation. It is possible that the abnormal ratio of free 40S/60S subunits in the \u03a3 strain obviates potentially more dramatic effects of the <i>ASC1</i> mutation on translation. In my view the authors should really test key observations from their study in a laboratory strain of yeast that has a more standard profile of free 40S and 60S subunits. Obviously this may be an unrealistic expectation as ribosome footprinting is neither cheap nor trivial- but some attempt to generalize the data could be made and the non-standard nature of the strain and the ratio of ribosomal subunits should be commented upon."

NAR, 2012). I wonder how the authors measured the 60S/40S ratios? I did not find a single note describing this procedure in the entire paper and the corresponding figure shows only the entire polysome profile that by definition cannot be used for estimating the 60S/40S ratio. This must be monitored in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and CHX, which I am not sure if it was \u2013 visual inspection of free 40S and 60S peaks in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> seems to suggest that these peaks could have been used for calculations\u2026.

If true, then the entire chapter describing the effects of mutations in two large ribosomal proteins (showing halfmers) seems irrelevant as well as their use in the glycerol media. I would think that the most appropriate way to show that the observed effects are really specific for <i>ASC1</i> would be to use mutants of some small ribosomal proteins occurring on the solvent-exposed side of the 40S ribosome in the vicinity of <i>ASC1</i> and examine their effects in the same way as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. Only then the authors could claim that the effect that they observed, which I do not dispute at all, is specific for <i>ASC1</i>. What if it is simply caused by a compromised function of any small ribosomal protein that may come in contact with closed-loop mRNAs with short ORFs and/or specific eIFs promoting their recruitment?"

One key issue concerns the view that there is inadequate analysis of protein synthesis from native genes or reporters to back up the claim that translation of short mRNAs with a heightened propensity to form the closed-loop is particularly sensitive to elimination of Asc1. The one reporter you analyzed where the coding sequence length was varied systematically was considered a creative approach, but the results obtained were not very compelling. Suggestions were offered for a different kind of reporter analysis, where a native long mRNA would be systematically shortened, and to examine protein synthesis of a panel of native mRNAs representing Asc1-dependent versus independent genes to confirm the interpretations of the ribosome-profiling data for authentic mRNAs. You could extend the analysis in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> to include additional Asc1-dependent mRNAs, and also include Asc1 independent mRNAs, but it might be difficult to detect changes in polysome distribution for short mRNAs, in which case measurements of protein and mRNA synthesis or reporter expression would be required. I recall that in our paper on eIF4G depletion (Park et al), which you used creatively in your analysis, we validated a number of mRNAs as being eIF4G-dependent or -independent, and perhaps some of these mRNAs that are short and enriched for both eIF4G and PABP occupancy could be analyzed in your strains to achieve stronger validation of your ribosome profiling data.</i> "

However, since short mRNAs are enriched for both closed-loop formation potential and for dependence on eIF4G, it isn't entirely clear whether it is length per se, ability to form the closed loop, or dependence on eIF4G that confers the greater than average requirement for Asc1 for efficient translation.</i> We were also quite struck by the relationship between ORF length and closed loop formation and its potential to explain the high translational efficiency of short ORFs observed in ribosome profiling data from diverse eukaryotes.

They use the ribosome footprinting technology to address the impact of different mutants in ASC1 and conclude that these mutations preferentially alter the translation of short mRNAs. I found the data interesting but oversold in places. The paper was also quite difficult to read due to a lack of technical detail in many of the methods descriptions and legends. Finally, I was not convinced that the authors had effectively shown that Asc1 affected translation directly. The authors desperately need to provide some direct measure of protein synthesis in this paper. The ribosome footprinting pattern across mRNAs provides an approximation of translation and how this changes, but there are other reasons that ribosomes might accumulate on mRNAs (see point about no-go mRNA decay below). So claims are made about the rates of initiation and the role of Asc1 in protein synthesis without actually ever measuring the synthesis rate of any endogenous proteins directly. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, the authors do measure the translation efficiency of a series of artificial engineered proteins to study the correlation between ORF length and the impact of ASC1 mutation. However, they need to show the primary data here so that the impact of the mutation on protein synthesis can be directly assessed by the reader. Also in my view validation that Asc1 specifically affects the synthesis of protein from some short mRNAs relative to some longer ones is essential.</i> We have validated the effect of Asc1 on the translational efficiency (protein/mRNA) of a short vs. long ORF reporter, and now include many more replicates demonstrating the significance of the length-dependent difference in sensitivity to Asc1. The primary data for the ORF length reporter experiments is quantitative Western blotting using fluorescent antibodies and qRT-PCR. A representative Western blot is shown in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a> to show the reader the clean nature of the fluorescent signal used to determine protein abundance. Since it is difficult to quantify protein abundance changes on this scale by eye, presentation of all the Western blots does not seem likely to be very helpful to the reader."

While the \u03a31278b strain is widely used for studies into filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae it is quite rarely used outside this, and it has some odd characteristics that raise concerns over the generality of the results shown. As has been shown previously on a number of occasions and is now shown in the polysomes presented here, \u03a31278b is very unusual in that it has abnormally high levels of free 60S subunits. The asc1 null has previously been shown to decrease 60S subunit levels and again the authors reconfirm this observation. The authors state that the ASC1 mutants have relatively subtle effects on protein synthesis and make statements about how subtle effects on translation as judged by polysome profiling can conceal a wider perturbation of cellular translation. It is possible that the abnormal ratio of free 40S/60S subunits in the \u03a3 strain obviates potentially more dramatic effects of the ASC1 mutation on translation. In my view the authors should really test key observations from their study in a laboratory strain of yeast that has a more standard profile of free 40S and 60S subunits. Obviously this may be an unrealistic expectation as ribosome footprinting is neither cheap nor trivial- but some attempt to generalize the data could be made and the non-standard nature of the strain and the ratio of ribosomal subunits should be commented upon.</i> Our laboratory has done several previous studies using the \u03a31278b strain, which, because it is wildtype for <i>FLO8</i>, retains characteristics of natural isolates that make it attractive for study. The <i>asc1\u2206</i> mutant has a striking phenotype, complete loss of invasive growth, in the \u03a31278b background. We therefore began our studies in this strain. There seems to be no firm basis for characterizing the free 40S/60S ratios of \u03a31278b, S288c, or w303 as \u2018normal\u2019 for yeast, although it is interesting that they differ. We are ultimately interested in looking at the conserved function of Asc1 in other eukaryotic species rather than other strains of yeast. The conservation of Asc1 and the closed loop factors suggests that this function of Asc1 should be highly conserved."

The polysomes are barely visible and the pattern of the other peaks looks substantially altered.

We hypothesize that the polysomes are lower because some fraction of them are crosslinked to larger complexes that do not resolve in the sucrose gradient.

It promotes translation arrest to facilitate mRNA decay by this pathway. It is therefore possible that the alterations in ribosome density on mRNAs for ASC1 mutants could be associated with this role. First, the authors do not present the genome wide transcript level datasets in detail, which they must have obtained for the ASC1 mutants relative to wild type. Is there any evidence for alterations in mRNA levels correlating with the ribosome densities? Indeed, at one point the authors show in a supplementary figure that translation efficiency correlates with mRNA half-life measurements from the Cramer group. Could this be the reason ASC1 mutants are altered in their ribosome density on short mRNAs? \u2013 Could it be that the role of Asc1 in mRNA decay pathways is the key?</i> Defects in no-go decay are inconsistent with the effects we see on \u2206TE. Please see our complete response in the summary above. We bring up the half-life correlations because we speculate that mRNA decay downstream of translational repression could explain the decrease in total RNA levels for some mRNAs with decreased TE in the <i>ASC1</i> mutants. A full understanding of this effect is outside the scope of this study, but recognizing the effect is an important aid to future discussion."

In particular, I tend to disagree with the authors that deletion of ASC1 per se compromises 60S biogenesis; in fact, this conclusion conversely further broadens the ASC1 controversy. We and others showed that it is exclusively U24 \u2013 the ASC1 intron \u2013 that is responsible for maintaining the wt levels of 60S subunits and not the ASC1 protein (Li et al., Plos Biol 2009 and Kouba et al. NAR, 2012). I wonder how the authors measured the 60S/40S ratios? I did not find a single note describing this procedure in the entire paper and the corresponding figure shows only the entire polysome profile that by definition cannot be used for estimating the 60S/40S ratio. This must be monitored in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and CHX, which I am not sure if it was \u2013 visual inspection of free 40S and 60S peaks in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> seems to suggest that these peaks could have been used for calculations\u2026.

We have now clarified the method used for 60S/40S ratio quantification in the Methods section. You are right in that we quantified the native polysome profiles directly without subunit dissociation. We did so because pilot experiments using subunit dissociation did not appear to be as sensitive to small changes as using the whole polysome profile. It is expected that a slight subunit imbalance will be more apparent in the whole polysome profile because only unassociated 40S and 60S subunits will be quantified. Although we cannot interpret the obtained values at the literal 60S/40S ratio (as in the case of polysome dissociation), we see no reason that they cannot be compared between different mutants as a way to assess their subunit imbalance."
