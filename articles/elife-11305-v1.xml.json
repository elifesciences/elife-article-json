However, recent studies have shown that deficient goal-directed control accompanies several disorders, including those without an obvious compulsive element. Reasoning that this lack of clinical specificity might reflect broader issues with psychiatric diagnostic categories, we investigated whether a dimensional approach would better delineate the clinical manifestations of goal-directed deficits. Using large-scale online assessment of psychiatric symptoms and neurocognitive performance in two independent general-population samples, we found that deficits in goal-directed control were most strongly associated with a symptom dimension comprising compulsive behavior and intrusive thought. This association was highly specific when compared to other non-compulsive aspects of psychopathology. These data showcase a powerful new methodology and highlight the potential of a dimensional, biologically-grounded approach to psychiatry research."

Each row reflects the results from an independent analysis where each questionnaire total score (z-transformed) was entered as SymptomScorez in the following model: lm(SymptomScorez ~ ModelBasedScore). Prior to conducting these analyses, we regressed out the effects of age, gender and IQ so that we could directly compare the r<sup>2</sup> of the models. ModelBasedScore was derived from the one-trial back regression (first three columns) or the computational model (last three columns results). For each, positive \u03b2 values indicate that the ModelBasedScore is associated with fewer symptoms, whereas negative \u03b2 values indicate that the symptom score is associated with increased symptoms. The difference between the two approaches is negligible. However the computational model did produce nominally higher r<sup>2</sup> and lower <i>p</i>-values for the relationship between clinical scores and model-based learning."

However, recent studies have shown that deficient goal-directed control accompanies several disorders, including those without an obvious compulsive element. Reasoning that this lack of clinical specificity might reflect broader issues with psychiatric diagnostic categories, we investigated whether a dimensional approach would better delineate the clinical manifestations of goal-directed deficits. Using large-scale online assessment of psychiatric symptoms and neurocognitive performance in two independent general-population samples, we found that deficits in goal-directed control were most strongly associated with a symptom dimension comprising compulsive behavior and intrusive thought. This association was highly specific when compared to other non-compulsive aspects of psychopathology. These data showcase a powerful new methodology and highlight the potential of a dimensional, biologically-grounded approach to psychiatry research."

This kind of control allows individuals to regulate their behaviour in a deliberate manner. It is thought that a reduction in goal-directed control may be linked to compulsiveness or compulsivity, a psychological trait that involves excessive repetition of thoughts or actions. Furthermore, evidence shows that goal-directed control is reduced in people with compulsive disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (or OCD) and drug addiction. However, failures of goal-directed control have also been reported in other mental health conditions that are not linked to compulsivity, such as social anxiety disorder."

Nearly 2,000 people completed an online task that assessed goal-directed control, and filled in questionnaires that measured symptoms of various mental health conditions. Gillan et al. showed that, as expected, people with reduced goal-directed control were generally more compulsive, and that this relationship could be seen in the context of both OCD and other compulsive disorders such as addiction."

In fact, reduced goal-directed control was found to be more closely related to compulsivity than the symptoms of traditional mental health disorders including OCD. These findings show that research into the causes of mental health conditions and perhaps ultimately diagnosis and treatment \u2013 all of which have traditionally approached specific disorders in isolation \u2013 would benefit greatly from a trans-diagnostic approach."

But what are the underlying neural, computational, or psychological mechanisms? Researchers have suggested that compulsivity in these disorders may be partially explained by an imbalance between two different modes of control, which are more and less flexible (<a href=\"#bib21\">Everitt and Robbins, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Graybiel and Rauch, 2000</a>). In particular, a deficit in deliberative, \u2018goal-directed\u2019 control may leave individuals vulnerable to rely excessively on forming more rigid habits. Habits are behaviors that animals and humans learn to execute automatically when presented with familiar environmental cues (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dickinson, 1985</a>). While habits are typically very useful, allowing us to efficiently perform routine actions while expending minimal cognitive effort, they cannot adapt flexibly to new situations. To override our habits, organisms are capable of \u2018goal-directed behavior\u2019. This refers our ability to make more considered choices, reflecting both (i) knowledge of the outcomes that our actions typically produce and (ii) our current motivation for those outcomes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dickinson and Balleine, 1994</a>). Consistent with the hypothesis that compulsion is linked to an imbalance between these modes of control, deficits in goal-directed learning have been observed across a range of putatively compulsive disorders such as drug addiction (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sjoerds et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Voon et al., 2015</a>), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Voon et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gillan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">2015a</a>) and also binge-eating disorder (<a href=\"#bib69\">Voon et al., 2015</a>). These deficits in goal-directed control have been linked to abnormal structure and function of the caudate and medial orbitofrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib69\">Voon et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gillan et al., 2015a</a>), suggesting that they may be a promising target for understanding the etiology of these disorders and thus for future treatment development."

In fact, a similar deficit in goal-directed control was recently reported in other patient groups (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alvares et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Morris et al., 2015</a>), including those diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and schizophrenia, at least the former of which is not characterized by repetitive compulsive acts. This casts serious doubt over the hypothesis that goal-directed deficits are a neurocognitive mechanism that is partly responsible for psychiatric compulsivity. This lack of specificity is unfortunately ubiquitous in psychiatry research (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lipszyc and Schachar, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bickel et al., 2012</a>), a result, we suggest, of the broader issue that psychiatric diagnostic categories do not reflect the most discrete and neurobiologically informative phenomena. Of particular relevance to the present study are the high rates of co-morbidity between OCD and social anxiety disorder (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ruscio et al., 2010</a>), the preponderance of OCD symptoms in the schizophrenia poopulation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Poyurovsky and Koran, 2005</a>), and more broadly that the vast majority of patients diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) meet the criteria for another lifetime psychiatric disorder (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ruscio et al., 2010</a>). Given these major overlaps, dissociating the neurocognitive bases for these respective diagnostic categories in their current form may be untenable."

As such it is difficult to clearly discriminate the diagnostic categories it defines on the basis of genetics, neuroimaging, or indeed any of the modern tools of cognitive neuroscience. These issues have been described in detail by others (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cuthbert and Kozak, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hyman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Robbins et al., 2012</a>), and have been recognized by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which has launched the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, aiming to identify biologically plausible, trans-diagnostic markers of psychiatric disturbances (<a href=\"#bib41\">Insel et al., 2010</a>). Although progress towards this goal has already been made by studies examining dissociable clusters of patients within groups diagnosed with the same disorder (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brodersen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fair et al., 2012</a>), the identification of robust, generalizable and specific markers that contribute to psychiatric co-morbidity has been curtailed by the small sample sizes that are typical of patient studies."

We hypothesized that this phenotype would broadly relate to compulsive behavior, which is seen across multiple disorders, including OCD and addiction (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gillan et al., 2015b</a>), but were interested to reveal the scope and generality of this, e.g. with respect to impulsivity, a putatively related clinical phenotype (<a href=\"#bib58\">Robbins et al., 2012</a>). We also wished to study how any psychiatric correlates of goal-directed control relate to variation in age and IQ, two more general factors that have been shown to covary both with goal-directed control and with some aspects of psychopathology (<a href=\"#bib20\">Eppinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schad et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sandstrom et al., 1998</a>). To this end, rather than diagnosed patients, we used two large general-population samples collected online via Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (AMT) to test (i) if compulsivity as indicated by self-report OCD symptoms is associated with individual differences in goal-directed learning, (ii) if this association generalizes to self-report symptoms of other DSM diagnostic categories that involve compulsivity, and (iii) if this association is specific to compulsive versus non-compulsive psychopathology."

Using this well-validated task (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Daw et al., 2011</a>), we found support for all three postulates. In Experiment 1, we found that total scores on a self-report questionnaire measuring the severity of OCD symptoms were tracked by normal variation in model-based learning in the general population, but not by self-report anxiety or depression symptoms. In Experiment 2, we replicated the association with self-report OCD symptoms and showed that it generalized to a broader set of psychiatric symptoms that similarly involve failures in exerting control over self-deleterious behaviors, specifically alcohol addiction, eating disorders and impulsivity. Once again, we found tentative evidence for specificity with respect to non-compulsive aspects of psychopathology. Next, we conducted a factor analysis, which indicated the existence of three latent symptom dimensions that cut across the nine different questionnaires assessed in this study. Crucially, the second symptom dimension identified was characterized by \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019, in which items were most consistently drawn from the questionnaires assessing symptoms of OCD, eating disorders and addiction, pertaining not just to repetitive compulsive behaviors (as was our prediction), but also to associated preoccupations and cognitive distortions. This factor, which was defined independently of task performance, was a significant predictor of deficits in model-based learning. Crucially, this effect was highly specific to this factor, when directly compared to the two other factors identified in this analysis, \u2018Anxious-Depression\u2019 and \u2018Social Withdrawal\u2019."

Participants (N = 548) first completed a reinforcement-learning task that quantifies individual differences in goal-directed (\u2018model-based\u2019) learning, which is operationalized as a parameter estimate from a logistic regression analysis predicting choices in the task (see Materials and methods and refs [<a href=\"#bib15\">Daw et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gillan et al., 2015c</a>]). Next, we administered a short Intelligence Quotient (IQ) test, followed by self-report questionnaires assessing symptoms of OCD, along with depression and trait anxiety, which we did not expect to be associated with goal-directed deficits. In line with our hypothesis, there was a significant association between scores on the OCD questionnaire and goal-directed deficits (i.e. a negative relationship between OCD severity and model-based learning; \u03b2 = \u22120.040, Standard Error (SE) = 0.02, p=0.049) when (as in all analyses reported henceforth) controlling for age, IQ and gender, which have been previously reported to covary with goal-directed behavior (<a href=\"#bib20\">Eppinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schad et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sandstrom et al., 1998</a>). Specifically, for each increase of 1 standard deviation (SD) in the total score on the OCD questionnaire, model-based learning was reduced by 14%. No such relationship was observed for self-report depression (\u03b2 = \u22120.016, SE = 0.02, p=0.439) or trait anxiety (\u03b2 = \u22120.006, SE = 0.02, p=0.777) severity (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Moreover, the relationship between total scores on the OCD questionnaire and goal-directed deficits survived inclusion of the depression and trait anxiety total scores in the same model as covariates (\u03b2 = \u22120.048, SE = 0.02, p=0.04).

To test for generalizability, we assessed symptoms associated with other disorders that have been hypothesized to have compulsive features. In addition to the OCD questionnaire used in Experiment 1, these pertained to alcohol addiction, eating disorders, along with aspects of impulsivity and schizotypy (<a href=\"#bib21\">Everitt and Robbins, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Poyurovsky and Koran, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Robbins et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Godier and Park, 2014</a>). To test for specificity, in addition to the mood symptoms assessed previously (depression and trait anxiety) we added self-report measures assessing social anxiety and apathy; we also predicted that non-compulsive aspects of schizotypy and impulsivity might not be associated with goal-directed control. In this independent sample, we replicated the results from Experiment 1; scores on the OCD questionnaire were significantly associated with goal-directed deficits (\u03b2=\u22120.026, SE=0.01, p=0.020), while controlling for age, gender and IQ (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

To address this issue, we conducted a factor analysis based on the 209 individual questionnaire items, thereby reducing the collinearity across scores on these psychiatric questionnaires. Note that this analysis was carried out on the questionnaire scores alone, without reference to the results on the reinforcement learning task. We found evidence for three dissociable factors (\u2018dimensions\u2019) that cut across the nine questionnaires from which items were drawn, which we labeled \u2018Anxious-Depression\u2019, \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019 and \u2018Social Withdrawal\u2019, based on the loadings of individual items (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Although the labeling of factors is of course a subjective process, quantitatively speaking, \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019 had high and consistent loadings from almost all items pertaining to eating disorders (Mean loading=0.36, SD=0.15), OCD (Mean loading=0.50, SD=0.06) and addiction (Mean loading=0.31, SD=0.07), which have all been couched as \u2018compulsive\u2019 disorders in the literature (<a href=\"#bib21\">Everitt and Robbins, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gillan and Robbins, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Godier and Park, 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In addition to picking up every self-report item that pertained to compulsive behavior from our question pool, the loadings on Factor 2 were not confined to compulsive behaviors, but equally featured items pertaining to related patterns of thought, i.e. obsessions, preoccupations, or intrusive thoughts. We cannot speak to causality here, but this suggests that repetitive behavior and repetitive, irrational patterns of thought are not orthogonal symptom dimensions, but perhaps share a common neurobiological root. Items from the impulsivity scale (of which the total score was a significant predictor of goal-directed deficits) did not load as strongly or consistently on this factor (M=0.15, SD=0.15; significantly less than the former three questionnaires, Eating Disorders vs. Impulsivity: t(52)=5.178; OCD vs. Impulsivity: t(41)=11.379; Alcohol Addiction vs. Impulsivity: t(33)=4.342, all p&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

Finally, we directly compared the associations between goal-directed deficits and these factors by including them in the same model and conducting planned contrasts. We found that deficits in goal-directed control were highly specific to the \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019 (vs. \u2018Anxious-Depression\u2019, \u03b2=\u22120.062, SE=0.02, p=0.001; vs. \u2018Social Withdrawal\u2019, \u03b2=\u22120.089, SE=0.02, p&lt;0.001). Moreover, when included in the same model with the other factors, \u2018Social Withdrawal\u2019 (onto which addiction and aspects of impulsivity load negatively) emerged as a significant <i>positive</i> predictor of goal-directed control over action (\u03b2=0.031, SE=0.01, p=0.014). To test the extent to which the relationship between goal-directed deficits and \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019 is truly continuous, we carried out a supplementary analysis in which this factor was entered as a quadratic term in our model, thereby testing for a nonlinear effect. We found no evidence for nonlinearity (beta=\u22120.0016, p=0.822), and the linear effect remained significant when included in this model (beta=\u22120.045, p=0.001).

Supporting our previous conclusions, those items that predicted model-based deficits in the negative direction substantially overlapped with items with above-threshold loadings on \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019 (75% overlap; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>). One noteworthy pattern arises among the exceptions. The supervised analysis also identified several additional items from the impulsivity questionnaire, which had not loaded on \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019, but did predict goal-directed learning. Those were items that tracked subjects\u2019 motivation to engage with the experimental paradigm, e.g. \u201cI (do not) like to think about complex problems\u201d. Other, more compulsivity-relevant items from the impulsivity scale, involving compulsive shopping and general loss of control over action, were identified in both analyses. The former items are likely of little clinical relevance, but can explain the strong association between impulsivity total scores and goal-directed deficits, despite the fact that impulsivity did not load strongly onto \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019."

In particular, higher IQ was associated with increases in goal-directed, \u2018model-based\u2019 learning. In contrast to the effect of age on \u2018model-free\u2019 learning, older people were significantly less \u2018model-based\u2019 compared to their younger counterparts. All of these results were replicated in Experiment 2. Additionally, the larger sample size in Experiment 2 allowed us to detect small but significant associations between gender and model-free and model-based learning. Males were significantly less model-free and more model-based relative to females tested in this study. Importantly, all of these effects are controlled for (by including age, IQ, and gender as additional covariates) in the analyses relating learning to psychiatric symptoms."

Critically, the results of the present study extend this finding to self-report symptoms of other subtypes of eating disorders, suggesting that Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought (and associated deficits in goal-directed control) are a key component of more aspects of eating disorders than previously documented. An entirely consistent exception was that items relating to exerting control over food intake (e.g. \u201cI display self-control around food\u201d) did not load strongly on the \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019 factor."

Using self-report social anxiety symptom scores in our general population sample, we did not replicate this finding, and in fact observed a trend towards enhanced goal-directed control associated with social anxiety symptoms. Specifically, in most analyses social anxiety symptoms (both total scores and the \u2018Social Withdrawal\u2019 factor) was unrelated to task performance. We did however observe a significant <i>positive</i> association between the \u2018Social Withdrawal\u2019 factor and goal-directed control in one analysis, while controlling for the other factors in the same analysis. This result should be interpreted with caution, given that the association was not sufficiently robust to predict goal-directed control alone, but this serves to illustrate that \u2018Social Withdrawal\u2019 trended towards predicting better goal-directed control, not worse. Two explanations for the discrepant findings between the present study and the prior investigation with diagnosed social anxiety disorder patients are the differences in sample size between our respective studies and that the co-morbidities reported for the social anxiety disorder population of the study by <a href=\"#bib1\">Alvares and colleagues (2014)</a> could not be controlled for and may have driven the reported association.

Consistent with the heterogeneous nature of schizophrenia, where two diagnosed patients can have entirely non-overlapping symptoms (<a href=\"#bib2\">American Psychological Association, 2013</a>), we did not find a significant association between the total score on the schizotypy questionnaire and deficits in goal-directed control (although this was significant in a second analysis based on a full computational model). However, using our trans-diagnostic approach, we found that in particular \u2018unusual experiences\u2019 characteristic of schizotypy loaded onto the \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019 factor, which in turn was a strong predictor of goal-directed deficits. This finding converges with studies highlighting that delusions are more closely linked to executive deficits than the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lysaker et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">2003</a>). In terms of clinical phenomenology, schizophrenia and OCD share a common pattern of abnormal beliefs and as DSM-5 and others have noted, the distinction between a delusion in schizophrenia and a strongly held belief in OCD is often blurred (<a href=\"#bib56\">Poyurovsky and Koran, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">American Psychological Association, 2013</a>). These data suggest that \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019, which comprises automatic behaviors as well as associated repetitive thoughts, may be common to both schizophrenia and OCD and explained by deficits in goal-directed control."

For instance, prior studies have found a consistent association between stress and goal-directed learning deficits (<a href=\"#bib53\">Otto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Schwabe and Wolf, 2009</a>), which might in principle mediate non-specific effects due to the considerable burdens of mental illness.

We found no association between \u2018Anxious-Depression\u2019 and deficits in goal-directed control, and moreover the specificity of goal-directed deficits to \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019 was confirmed through direct statistical comparisons."

Indeed, this converges with prior work showing that when OCD patients are performing habits, they show dysfunctional hyperactivity in the caudate (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gillan et al., 2015a</a>), a region associated with goal-directed control over behavior (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dolan and Dayan, 2013</a>). An outstanding question, however, is the extent to which excessive stimulus-response habit learning also contributes to Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought. The model-free component of the task we employed in the present study did not relate significantly to psychiatric symptomatology, as indeed we had hypothesized because it also does not appear to be sensitive to slow habitual learning (indeed, unlike the model-based component of the task, it does not predict devaluation [<a href=\"#bib33\">Gillan et al., 2015c</a>]). Future work is needed to develop a computational marker of individual differences in stimulus-response habit formation, so that this possibility can directly be tested."

One possibility was raised by a recent study, which demonstrated that just like low-level stimulus-response behaviors, more abstract goal selection can also be rendered habitual (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cushman and Morris, 2015</a>). If these habitual cognitive actions can be conceived as a sort of \u2018habit of thought,\u2019 this might indicate a common mechanism for both compulsive behavior and the related repetitive patterns of thought (i.e. \u2018habits of thought\u2019). An alternative possibility posits that obsessive thoughts may develop as a <i>result</i> of compulsive behavior (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gillan and Robbins, 2014</a>). Evidence for this idea comes from a study where OCD patients were found to engage in <i>post-hoc</i> rationalization in order to explain a series of habitual responses (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gillan et al., 2014b</a>). The notion is that in OCD, experiencing a recurrent urge to wash one\u2019s hands might cause a patient to infer that they are concerned about hygiene. Future, longitudinal work will be needed to dissect the temporal dynamics of these symptom features to test these hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive."

The present study offers some insights in this regard. While the total score of the impulsivity scale was a strong predictor of goal-directed deficits, it did not load significantly onto the \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019 factor, suggesting it has an independent association with goal-directed deficits. The supervised analysis identified the items from the impulsivity scale that best predicted goal-directed deficits. In terms of the overlap between the impulsivity questionnaire items and Factor 2, the two above-threshold predictors of model-based deficits were \u201cI spend or charge more than I earn\u201d and \u201cI do things without thinking\u201d, each of which is qualitatively characteristic of compulsive, habitual behavior. Importantly, the three items that did <i>not</i> overlap with \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019, but still predicted model-based learning, tracked subjects\u2019 general interest in engaging with the task (e.g. \u201cI do not like puzzles\u201d, \u201cI do not like to think about complex problems\u201d). We suggest that these items may not be of particular clinical importance, but simply serve as a marker of how likely individuals are to engage with the task material. In summary, while a small subset of the impulsivity items contributed to \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019, impulsivity as assessed by our scale was mostly distinct. Of course, impulsivity as a construct itself involves a broad range of potentially distinct behaviors, such as impatient inter-temporal choice preferences and premature responding (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dalley et al., 2011</a>). Further work will be need to assess how such behaviors relate to the features measured here; notably, our large-scale online methodology is well suited for examining such questions."

Although these effects were controlled for in all analyses and therefore do not bias the interpretation of our results, they highlight the fact that the coupling between model-based learning and \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019 is far from perfect. One particularly interesting observation is that as people get older, they show greater deficits in model-based learning (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>), but fewer psychiatric symptoms on all nine questionnaires collected in the present study (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>), in line with prior work with diagnosed patients (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kessler et al., 2005</a>). This incongruence suggests that there may be multiple dissociable processes responsible for model-based learning. Future studies are needed to dissect this somewhat complex construct into its constituent parts (as has been already attempted for other executive tasks [<a href=\"#bib50\">Miyake et al., 2000</a>]), with a view to identifying the simpler component that is specific to the compulsive phenotype. Relatedly, future work might test if working memory might conceivably contribute to this association observed in the present study (<a href=\"#bib53\">Otto et al., 2013</a>). Also, the strength of the association between a clinical phenotype and an underlying mechanism is fundamentally limited by the accuracy with which we can assess that phenotype. Aside from issues of relatively low reliability of self-report clinical symptoms (e.g. self-report OCD, <i>r</i>=0.71 [<a href=\"#bib37\">Hajcak et al., 2004</a>]), we are also limited by the questions we ask. For example, in the present study we did not account for pathological gambling or trichotillomania, which are similarly defined clinically by a loss of control over repetitive behavior (<a href=\"#bib55\">Potenza, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chamberlain et al., 2007</a>) and therefore may contribute noise to our signal. It is clear that iterative improvements to both self-report assessment and behavioral testing are needed to increase effect sizes and further refine the neurobiological characterization of Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought suggested by these data."

We first identified a heretofore-unrecognized collection of trans-diagnostic psychiatric symptoms based on their inter-correlations and then validated this clustering by demonstrating an association with neurocognitive performance in an independent task. \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019 is not intended to be a fixed or final definition \u2013 rather it is hoped that future work can (i) use the clusters defined in this study to find closer links between biological markers and clinical and (ii) improve and augment these clusters through further data-driven evaluations.

Conversely, the co-morbidity between OCD and anxiety disorders might be explained by an orthogonal (equally important) symptom dimension.

Model-based learning, like \u2018goal-directed learning\u2019, reflects the extent to which individuals integrate contingency information with estimations of outcome value to make choices, and predicts whether or not individuals can exert control over their habits in a devaluation test (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gillan et al., 2015c</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Friedel et al., 2014</a>). While model-free learning has been suggested to capture slow incremental learning characteristic of habit-formation itself, empirical studies using sequential decision tasks have not detected this relationship (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gillan et al., 2015c</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Friedel et al., 2014</a>), and this converges with the empirical observation that deficits in model-based (but not model-free) learning have been observed in compulsive disorders (<a href=\"#bib69\">Voon et al., 2015</a>). The design of the task is presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. On each trial, subjects were presented with a choice between two fractals (2.5 s choice window). Each fractal usually (i.e. \u2018common\u2019 transitions: 70%, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, white arrow) led to a particular second state (orange or blue) displaying another two fractal options. Selecting one of the fractals in the second stage resulted in participants being probabilistically rewarded with a picture of a 25\u00a2 coin. There was a unique probability of receiving a reward associated with each second stage fractal, and these drifted slowly and independently over time (never being less than 0.25 or greater than 0.75). Responses were indicated using the left (\u2018E\u2019) and right (\u2018I\u2019) keys. Critically, on 30% of \u2018rare\u2019 trials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, grey arrow), choices uncharacteristically led to the alternative second state. A purely \u2018model-free\u2019 learner makes choices based solely on whether or not they were rewarded the last time they performed this action, regardless of whether the transition was rare or common (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). A \u2018model-based\u2019 learner, in contrast, makes decisions based not only on the history of reward, but also the transition structure of the task, i.e. the environmental contingency (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). For example, if a choice was followed by a rare transition to a second state, and that second state was rewarded, a model-based learner would be more likely to choose the alternate action on the next trial, because this is more likely to return them to that rewarding second state. A model-free learner, on the other hand, would be more likely to repeat that same action again, making no adjustment based on the transition type. We used a logistic regression based on this logic to identify from their switching patterns the extent to which each participant exhibited goal-directed (model-based, vs. model-free) choices (<a href=\"#bib15\">Daw et al., 2011</a>)."

The model tested if subjects\u2019 choice behavior (coded as switch: 0; stay: 1, relative to the previous choice) was influenced by Reward (coded as rewarded: 1; unrewarded: -1), Transition (coded as common: 1, rare: -1), and their interaction, on the preceding trial. A main effect of reward indicates that there is a significant contribution of model-free learning to choice behavior. An interaction between Reward and Transition indicates that there is a significant contribution of model-based learning to choice behavior. Within-subject factors (the intercept, main effects of reward and transition, and their interaction) were taken as random effects, i.e. allowed to vary across subjects. First, we tested our basic logistic regression model, which included age, gender and IQ as fixed effects covariates. We used Bound Optimization by Quadratic Approximation (bobyqa) with 1e5 functional evaluations. The model was specified in the syntax of R as follows:"

There was also an unhypothesized significant main effect of Transition and an interaction between Transition and IQ, such that subjects were more likely to stay following a common transition and individuals higher in IQ showed this pattern more strongly. This seemingly anomalous effect is likely a side effect of additional structure in the choices that the regression model fails to capture. In particular, in the full computational model, choices are impacted by incremental learning that accrues over trials, such that a choice on some trial is affected by rewards on multiple preceding trials. Although the regression model considers only the most recent trial\u2019s rewards, some aspects of additional learning might be correlated with the transition term, producing small bias that can be detected given the large sample size of the current study (<a href=\"#bib65\">Skatova et al., 2013</a>). For instance, the full model tends to encounter a negative reward prediction error immediately following a rare transition, which is driven by learning about second-stage state values driven by rewards received on previous trials. Such structure is more interpretably subsumed within the model-based and model-free learning terms in the fits of the fuller computational model, where, notably, the key results were all recapitulated (see below)."

Factor analysis was conducted using the factanal() function from the Psych package in R, with an oblique rotation (oblimin). Two hundred and nine individual questionnaire items were entered as measured variables into the factor analysis. As responses on the schizotypy scale were binary at the item-level, a heterogeneous correlation matrix was computed using the hector function in polycor package in R. This allowed for Pearson correlations between numeric variables, polyserial correlations between numeric and binary items and polychoric correlations between binary variables. Factor selection was based on Cattell\u2019s criterion (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cattell, 1966</a>); wherein a sharp transition from horizontal to vertical (\u2018elbow\u201d) indicates that there is little benefit to retaining additional factors. The scree-plot was analyzed using an objective implementation of this criterion, the Cattell-Nelson-Gorsuch (CNG) test, which computes the slopes of all possible sets of three adjacent eigenvalues and determines the point at which there is the greatest differences in slope (nFactors package in R) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Gorsuch and Nelson, 1981</a>). The CNG test indicated the existence of a 3-factor latent structure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), which comprises factors that we labeled \u2018Anxious-Depression\u2019, \u2018Compulsive Behavior and Intrusive Thought\u2019 and \u2018Social Withdrawal\u2019 based on the strongest individual item loadings (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary files 2A, 2B &amp; 2C</a>, respectively). Although Cattell\u2019s criterion is perhaps the most widely utilized rule-of-thumb for factor selection, we acknowledge that there are many alternatives and indeed another objective method, \u2018Parallel Analysis\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Drasgow and Lissak, 1983</a>), suggests an 8-factor solution to our data. This model was not only less parsimonious than the 3-factor solution, but in addition, a <i>post hoc</i> analysis revealed that it was also quantitatively inferior at predicting task performance when these 8 factors were entered as predictors in a mixed effects model (as per our main task analyses). Specifically, both Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were lower for the mixed effects model with covariates derived from the 3-factor solution relative to the 8-factor solution, indicating that this model was the best at predicting behavior."

Elastic Net (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zou and Hastie, 2005</a>) regularization imposes a hybrid of both L<sub>1</sub>- and L<sub>2</sub>-norm penalties (i.e., penalties on the absolute (L<sub>1</sub> norm) and squared values of the \u03b2 weights (L<sub>2</sub> norm)). This allows relevant but correlated coefficients to coexist in a sparse model fit, by doing automatic variable selection and continuous shrinkage simultaneously, and selects or rejects groups of correlated variables. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator LASSO, (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tibshirani, 1996</a>) and ridge regression (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hoerl and Kennard, 1970</a>) are special cases of the Elastic Net. The dependent measure in this analysis was each subject\u2019s model-based score (i.e individual subject\u2019s coefficients for reward x transition, corrected for age, IQ and gender, from the analysis in Experiment 2, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). All predictor data were first feature scaled (z-score transformed). We implemented ten-fold cross-validation with nested cross-validation for tuning and validating the model. Briefly, to implement cross-validation, the data were randomly split into 10 groups. A model was then generated based on 9 training groups, and then applied to the remaining independent testing group. Each group served as the testing group once, resulting in 10 different models, and predictions for every subject based on independent data. Nested cross-validation involved subdividing the 9 training groups (i.e., 90% of the sample) into a further 10 groups (\u2018inner\u2019 folds). Within these 10 inner folds, 9 were utilized for training a model over a range of 50 alpha (0.01\u20131) and 50 lambda (0.0001\u20131) values, where alpha is the weight of lasso versus ridge optimization and lambda is the regularization coefficient. This generated a resulting model fit on the inner fold test set for each possible combination of alpha and lambda. The mean fit over all 10 inner folds for each combination of alpha and lambda was then calculated and then used to determine the optimal parameters for the outer fold. We conducted 100 iterations of regularization with tenfold validation and retained items that were significant predictors of model-based learning in &gt;=95% of final models. The overall model was significant, with the median cross-validated p=0.00003, median cross-validated <i>r</i>=0.11. Twenty-eight features met these criteria and are listed in <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>."

Specifically, we used subject-level estimates of model-based and model-free learning from the computational model as dependent variables in regression analyses where clinical characteristics (i.e. questionnaire total scores and factors from factor analysis) were independent variables. The results of the full reinforcement-learning model mirrored that of the logistic regression analysis in almost every respect. The two differences were that when estimated using the computational model, the relationship between self-report OCD symptoms and goal-directed learning in Experiment 1 fell short of reaching significance at p&lt;0.05 (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 5A</a>). The size of this effect was similar in Experiment 2, but with the benefit of an increased sample size was highly significant, indicating this was an issue of statistical power. Secondly, while Schizotypy did not reach significance as a predictor of model-based deficits using the regression model, it was a significant predictor model-based learning when computationally estimated. There were no relationships between self-report psychopathology and model-free learning defined using the computational model. A side-by-side comparison of the predictive power of model-based learning defined using the computational model versus one-trial back regression analysis is presented in <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 5B</a>."

They also agreed that the approach is original, exploits a large online sample (with appropriate controls for data quality), and is based on a systematic body of work, conducted by the authors over several years. However, they all expressed concerns with respect to the main take-home message of the manuscript that compulsivity is a trans-diagnostic factor that relates to deficits in model-based learning. This was particularly concerning given that other demographic factors (e.g., age) had even greater impact on the same measure of model-basedness, limiting the conclusions (and application) that one could garner from using this theoretically grounded construct clinically. Nevertheless, we all agree that the analysis is itself useful and sophisticated and we would like to see a revised manuscript that substantially tones down the main claim in the thrust of the motivation (including the title). We would be happy to consider a more nuanced, balanced and thorough (perhaps longer) characterization of the phenotype that is not as centrally focused on compulsivity, but rather presents a large scale analysis of factors that relate to MB vs. MF performance (and indeed other task measures not obviously MB per se, like the transition effect), including age, gender, IQ but also other clinical factors (impulsivity vs. compulsivity), whether these are independent or interactive factors, with discussions on whether they are likely to have similar or different mechanisms, etc. While this may seem like a major undertaking, we think that ultimately this kind of description can be more useful for showcasing the strength of your combination of theory-driven and data-driven approaches. Should you wish to maintain the stronger claim and message and focus on compulsivity we would suggest submitting elsewhere. Below these points are elaborated by comments from the individual reviewers, compiled together."

The results are initially very intriguing \u2013 particularly those from the elastic net where impairments in goal-directed control seem to pick out symptoms of compulsivity and intrusive thoughts. However, on reading it more closely there are some important drawbacks which I think require the conclusions to be very significantly toned down; or additional analyses to substantiate them.

How can this be if goal-directed impairments underlie compulsivity in such a specific manner? The answer presumably is that goal-directedness depends on multiple processes, and that those related to compulsivity and age might in some way be dissociable. But does that not then make compulsivity a less specific guide to the underlying neurobiology? Isn't this also suggested by the fact that the relationship is, overall, quite weak: in the elastic net, the cross-validated correlation is 0.11? The temporal evolution of OCD decreasing with age also jars with the influence of age."

The possibility that the task seems to be insensitive to habitual variation (it never seems to show up in correlations despite the model-free prediction error regressors showing the strongest correlations with BOLD, i.e. neurobiology) somewhat questions the strong conclusions about compulsivity being specifically due to an impairment in goal-directed control: subjects could also have an impairment (excess?) in habitual learning (as one might conclude from excessive habitual behavior in e.g. Gillan et al., 2015 AJP), but this doesn't show up in the task because it's not sensitive. This again makes the conclusions they are drawing from the results just too strong. They state that the literature shows that deficits in model-based but not model-free decision-making has been found and cite Voon et al., Mol.

At the core if this is that it is unclear whether the results are driven by what one might observe in a typical patient population. One way to address this is to recapitulate the results only amongst those subjects with scores above cutoffs in any one measure, and then talk about 'putative patients' or so. We also need to know whether those subjects excluded based on performance were typical in terms of self-report."

Half the questionnaires are correlated (and picked up by the compulsivity factor). The most severely ill patients might thus be most likely to respond positively on many compulsivity items. Could it be that the most severely impaired patients simply look compulsive because they are more likely to have more comorbid disorders and hence show up in the compulsive category?"

Anxiety loads much more on the second factor, and does so possibly even more than compulsivity: there are around 9 or 10 items that clearly relate to anxiety loading onto it, but only 2 items relating to compulsive behaviours. A number of the AUDIT variables are hard to relate to compulsions: alcoholics start drinking early as they experience withdrawal symptoms after a night of sleep. If anything, this component is more related to obsessions, anxious worries and difficulties controlling thoughts \u2013 which is, in terms of constructs, much closer to goal-directed deficits, it seems to me."

As you outlined in the Introduction, a key motivation for studying the relation between model-based /goal-directed decision-making and compulsive symptoms is the notion that \"a deficit in deliberative, goal-directed control may leave individuals vulnerable to rely excessively on forming more rigid habits\". I understand why this is a straightforward and attractive perspective to explain certain aspects of compulsivity. However, I think it would also be appropriate to mention challenges and potential limitations of this perspective in the Discussion \u2013 particularly because the dimensional approach chosen here suggests applicability of the proposed mechanism to clinical phenomena. For example, how exactly would a putative deficit in model-based control lead to prominent symptoms in OCD, such as excessive checking, fear of germs, or desire for order? The nomenclature and with it the framing need quite some work, e.g. categorical/dimensional measures, in terms of state/trait distinction, and distinctions between compulsions and obsessions."

However, sometimes a few more technical details or conceptual distinctions may have to be included in the main text to avoid confusion. First, the Introduction repeatedly refers to unspecified \"OCD symptoms\" which I found confusing, given that the paper is about the general population and that numerous symptoms of OCD exist. I would recommend avoiding the clinical label OCD and referring to compulsivity instead, stating the specific questionnaire you used. Similarly, in the Results section (second paragraph), there is a tension between using trait labels (impulsivity, compulsivity) and diagnostic labels (eating disorders, alcohol addiction); the latter is confusing (and not quite appropriate), given that your study examines the general population. You could eliminate this tension and, at the same time, increase clarity by always referring to the scores of the respective questionnaires. Second, the Results section should define the measure of model-based learning used (first paragraph). Until I went through the Methods section, I was not sure how exactly model-based learning was operationalised, and whether you were referring to a behavioural readout or to the parameter estimates of a computational model."

It would be instructive for the technically interested reader if you could include estimates of predictive accuracy for both approaches, perhaps in the supplementary material."

Specifically, in the prior submission we displayed just the top 6 items from each questionnaire that loaded on a given factor. This evidently led one reviewer to believe certain items from the OCD scale did not load at all on Factor 2, when in fact they were amongst the highest loading items of all items (just not in the top 6). We have changed our presentation approach to avoid this misunderstanding and believe this resolves several of the reviewers\u2019 concerns.

Not directly mentioning these in the label, may serve to inappropriately diminish their contribution and this was not our intention.

The answer presumably is that goal-directedness depends on multiple processes, and that those related to compulsivity and age might in some way be dissociable.

Our experiment was designed to test if, taking into account these other potentially confounding factors, goal- directed deficits are specific to one well-delineated aspect of psychopathology (e.g., compulsive symptoms or some other construct with some larger scope) compared to others (i.e. depressive or anxious symptoms).

The EAT scale addresses at least three different disorders, which the clinician must consider in the context of differential diagnosis: Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, and Binge Eating Disorder. Moreover, the eating disorder questionnaire also simply has more items (n=26) compared to the OCD questionnaire (n=18) and the addiction scale (n=10)."
