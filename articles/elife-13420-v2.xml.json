The concept of <i>synergy</i> has been proposed to indicate functional modules that may simplify the control of hand postures by simultaneously recruiting sets of muscles and joints. However, whether and to what extent synergic hand postures are encoded as such at a cortical level remains unknown. Here, we combined kinematic, electromyography, and brain activity measures obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects performed a variety of movements towards virtual objects. Hand postural information, encoded through kinematic synergies, were represented in cortical areas devoted to hand motor control and successfully discriminated individual grasping movements, significantly outperforming alternative somatotopic or muscle-based models. Importantly, hand postural synergies were predicted by neural activation patterns within primary motor cortex. These findings support a novel cortical organization for hand movement control and open potential applications for brain-computer interfaces and neuroprostheses."

The table displays the rank accuracy values for the two models derived from kinematic and EMG data, with a number of retained PCs ranging from 1 to 10 (kinematic and EMG synergies) or 1 to 5 (individual digits). The reported values are the accuracy scores averaged across subjects and their SD. Notably, the <i>individual digit</i> model could explain only a moderate fraction of the total variance of the kinematic data (mean: 26.59%, range 14.46% to 34.97%). PCA dimensionality reduction was therefore successful as the first five synergies (later used for encoding fMRI activity) could explain a mean variance across subjects of 91.78% in the kinematic data and 72.64% in the EMG data. (N) Group synergies defined by constrained <i>k</i>-means The three core kinematic synergies from each participant were grouped across participants with a semi-supervised clustering algorithm (Bilenko et al., 2004). The procedure showed that the first three synergies were highly consistent and had the same rank across almost all subjects (i.e., PC 1 was in the first position in most of the subjects). Overall, 77.78% of the single subject synergies were consistently labeled across subjects. The table represents the three \u201cgroup synergies\u201d and lists the single-subject synergies that compose each of them."

The concept of <i>synergy</i> has been proposed to indicate functional modules that may simplify the control of hand postures by simultaneously recruiting sets of muscles and joints. However, whether and to what extent synergic hand postures are encoded as such at a cortical level remains unknown. Here, we combined kinematic, electromyography, and brain activity measures obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects performed a variety of movements towards virtual objects. Hand postural information, encoded through kinematic synergies, were represented in cortical areas devoted to hand motor control and successfully discriminated individual grasping movements, significantly outperforming alternative somatotopic or muscle-based models. Importantly, hand postural synergies were predicted by neural activation patterns within primary motor cortex. These findings support a novel cortical organization for hand movement control and open potential applications for brain-computer interfaces and neuroprostheses."

The reported values are the accuracy scores averaged across subjects and their SD. Notably, the <i>individual digit</i> model could explain only a moderate fraction of the total variance of the kinematic data (mean: 26.59%, range 14.46% to 34.97%). PCA dimensionality reduction was therefore successful as the first five synergies (later used for encoding fMRI activity) could explain a mean variance across subjects of 91.78% in the kinematic data and 72.64% in the EMG data. (N) Group synergies defined by constrained <i>k</i>-means The three core kinematic synergies from each participant were grouped across participants with a semi-supervised clustering algorithm (Bilenko et al., 2004). The procedure showed that the first three synergies were highly consistent and had the same rank across almost all subjects (i.e., PC 1 was in the first position in most of the subjects). Overall, 77.78% of the single subject synergies were consistently labeled across subjects.

This is exemplified by the hand\u2019s ability to mold to objects and tools by combining motion and force in the individual digits so to reach a variety of hand postures. The multiple ways in which the hand can perform a given goal-directed movement arise from anatomical, functional, and kinematic redundancies, i.e., a large number of degrees of freedom (DoFs) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bernstein, 1967</a>). Such an organization results highly advantageous from an operational perspective, as redundant DoFs enable the hand to flexibly adapt to different task demands, or to switch among multiple postural configurations, while maintaining grasp stability (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bernstein, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Santello et al., 2013</a>). At the same time, this organization raises the question about how the central nervous system deals with these redundancies and selects a set of DoFs to accomplish a specific motor task (<a href=\"#bib67\">Latash et al., 2007</a>). While some models propose the notion of \u201cfreezing\u201d of redundant DoFs (<a href=\"#bib107\">Vereijken et al., 1992</a>) or the implementation of optimization strategies (<a href=\"#bib29\">Flash and Hogan, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Todorov, 2004</a>), further studies have favored an alternative solution based on linear dimensionality reduction strategies or <i>motor synergies</i> (<a href=\"#bib68\">Latash, 2010</a>)."

According to the latter hypothesis, motor cortical areas and/or spinal modules may control the large number of DoFs of the hand through weighted combinations of synergies (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gentner and Classen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Santello et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Santello and Lang, 2014</a>), in a way similar to that demonstrated for other motor acts, such as gait, body posture, and arm movements (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cheung et al., 2009</a>).

Hand posture (expressed as a matrix of 24 joints angles by 20 hand postures) was therefore predicted with a multiple linear regression procedure from fMRI data. Specifically, this procedure could reliably reconstruct the different hand postures across participants. The goodness-of-fit (R<sup>2</sup>) between the original and reconstructed joint angle patterns related to single movements, averaged across subjects, ranged between 0.51 and 0.90 (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>).

To exclude this possibility, an encoding procedure using the <i>kinematic synergy</i> model was performed within the region of interest (ROI) chosen for RSA and posture reconstruction, using exclusively the neural activity related to visual object presentation, measured five seconds after the stimulus onset.

Subsequently, an encoding analysis was performed similarly to the above-mentioned procedures.

The concept of <i>synergy</i> has been proposed to denote functional modules that may simplify the control of hand postures by simultaneously recruiting sets of muscles and joints. In the present study, by combining kinematic, EMG, and brain activity measures using fMRI, we provide the first demonstration that hand postural information encoded through kinematic synergies is represented within the cortical network controlling hand movements. Importantly, we demonstrate that kinematic synergies strongly correlate with the neural responses in primary and supplementary motor areas, as well as movement-related parietal and premotor regions. Furthermore, we show that kinematic synergies are topographically arranged in the precentral and postcentral cortex and represent meaningful primitives of grasping. Finally, the neural responses in sensorimotor cortex allow for a highly successful decoding of complex hand postures. Therefore, we conclude that the human motor cortical areas are likely to represent hand posture by combining few elementary modules."

Our paper introduces a methodological and conceptual advancement. While, in Ejaz et al., full matrices of postural, functional or muscle data have been considered in the RSA, here we focused on descriptions with lower dimensionality, which lose only minor portions of information.

Other authors have proposed a possible 'grasp taxonomy' in which multiple, different types of grasps are described according to hierarchical criteria rooted on three main classes: precision, power and intermediate (<a href=\"#bib28\">Feix et al., 2009</a>). By combining these three elementary grasps, it is possible to generate a wide number of postures. Notwithstanding the advancements of these taxonomies in describing hand posture, much less effort has been made to understand how the wide variety of human hand postures can be represented in the brain. Our results indicate that a synergy framework may predict brain activity patterns underlying the control of hand posture. Of note, the highest-ranked kinematic synergies can be clearly identified as grasping primitives: the first synergy modulates abduction-adduction and flexion-extension of both the proximal and distal finger joints, while a second synergy reflects thumb opposition and flexion-extension of the distal joints only. Maximizing the first synergy leads therefore to a posture resembling a power grasp, while the second one is linked to pinch movements directed towards smaller objects, and the third one represents movements of flexion and thumb opposition (like in grasping a dish or a platter) (<a href=\"#bib87\">Santello et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Gentner and Classen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ingram et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Thakur et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). For this reason, the description of hand postures can benefit from reduction to combinations of few, meaningful synergies, which can provide more reliable results than clustering methods based on a small number of categories (<a href=\"#bib88\">Santello et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ingram et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Thakur et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Tessitore et al., 2013</a>)."

The map suggests that the PCs are topographically arranged, forming clusters with a preference for each of the three synergies, separated by smooth transitions. This organization resembles that observed in the retinotopy of early visual areas (<a href=\"#bib96\">Sereno et al., 1995</a>) or in auditory cortex as studied with tonotopic mapping (<a href=\"#bib32\">Formisano et al., 2003</a>). This observation strongly suggests that primary motor and somatosensory brain regions may show specific, organized representations of synergies across the cortical surface. Such an observation is unprecedented, since the large number of previous studies adopted techniques, such as single cell recording (<a href=\"#bib83\">Riehle and Requin, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib113\">Zhang et al., 1997</a>) or intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) (<a href=\"#bib77\">Overduin et al., 2012</a>), which can observe the activity of single neurons but do not capture the functional organization of motor cortex as a whole. Motor cortex has historically been hypothesized to be somatotopically organized in a set of sub-regions that control different segments of the body (<a href=\"#bib78\">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</a>). However, whereas subsequent work confirmed this organization (<a href=\"#bib80\">Penfield and Welch, 1951</a>), a major critical point remains the internal organization of the single subregions (e.g., hand, leg or face areas). To date, a somatotopy of fingers within the hand area appears unlikely: as each digit is controlled by multiple muscles, individual digits may be mapped in a distributed rather than discrete fashion (<a href=\"#bib78\">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Schieber, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Graziano et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aflalo and Graziano, 2006</a>). An alternative view posits that movements are represented in M1 as clusters of neurons coding for different action types or goals (<a href=\"#bib44\">Graziano, 2016</a>). In fact, mouse motor cortex is organized in clusters that encode different motor acts (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brown and Teskey, 2014</a>). Similarly, stimulation of motor cortex in monkeys produces movements directed to stable spatial end-points (<a href=\"#bib43\">Graziano et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aflalo and Graziano, 2006</a>) and may have a synergistic organization (<a href=\"#bib77\">Overduin et al., 2012</a>). Recently, it has been demonstrated in both monkeys and humans that complex movements can be recorded from parietal as well as premotor and motor areas (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aflalo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Klaes et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, a successful decoding can be achieved in those regions both during motor planning and execution (<a href=\"#bib90\">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015</a>). These observations about the internal organization of motor cortex were demonstrated also in humans, revealing that individual representations of digits within M1 show a high degree of overlap (<a href=\"#bib54\">Indovina and Sanes, 2001</a>) and that, despite digits may be arranged in a coarse ventro-dorsal order in somatosensory cortex, their representations are intermingled so that the existence of digit specific voxels is unlikely (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ejaz et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, individual cortical voxels may contain enough information to encode specific gestures (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bleichner et al., 2014</a>)."

To this aim, each individual posture was expressed as a set of synergies that were derived from the fMRI activity on an independent cortical map. The results were reported as correlation values between the sets of joint angles originally tracked during kinematic recording and the joint angles derived from the reconstruction procedure. Overall, hand postures can be reconstructed with high accuracy based on the neural activity patterns. This result yields potential applications for the development of novel brain computer interfaces: for instance, previous studies demonstrated that neural spikes in primary motor cortex can be used to control robotic limbs used for performing simple or complex movements (<a href=\"#bib94\">Schwartz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Schwartz, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Velliste et al., 2008</a>). Previous studies in monkeys suggest that neural activity patterns associated with\u00a0grasp trajectories can be predicted from single neuron activity in M1 (<a href=\"#bib84\">Saleh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Saleh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015</a>) and recently neuronal spikes have been associated with principal components (<a href=\"#bib72\">Mollazadeh et al., 2014</a>). In humans, cortical activity obtained through intracranial recordings can be used to decode postural information (<a href=\"#bib82\">Pistohl et al., 2012</a>) and proper techniques can even lead to decode EMG activity from fMRI patterns (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ganesh et al., 2008</a>) or from ECoG signals (<a href=\"#bib30\">Flint et al., 2014</a>). So far, decoding of actual posture from fMRI activity in M1 was possible at individual voxel level, albeit with simplified paradigms and supervised classifiers that identified only four different movements (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bleichner et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, by proving that posture-specific sets of joint angles \u2013 expressed by synergy loadings \u2013 can be decoded from the\u00a0fMRI activity, we show that information about hand synergies is present in functional data and can be even used to identify complex gestures. Other authors similarly demonstrated that a set of few synergies can describe hand posture in a reliable way, obtaining hand postures that correlated highly with those recorded with optical tracking (<a href=\"#bib101\">Thakur et al., 2008</a>)."

The use of imagined objects allows to avoid confounding variables including grasping forces, difficulty in handling objects within a restricting environments, that could play a role in modulating motor acts. In previous behavioral reports, synergies were evaluated using contact with real objects (<a href=\"#bib88\">Santello et al., 2002</a>) and participants could also explore them in an unconstrained manner instead of concentrating on single actions (e.g., grasping) (<a href=\"#bib101\">Thakur et al., 2008</a>). Another study tracked hand motion across many gestures performed in an everyday life setting (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ingram et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, the dimensionality reduction methods were adopted with high consistency in these reports, despite the wide variety of experimental settings, and the first few PCs could explain most of the variance across a very wide number of motor acts. Moreover, when motor acts were performed toward both real and imagined objects, the results obtained from synergy evaluation were highly similar (<a href=\"#bib88\">Santello et al., 2002</a>)."

Moreover, the <i>muscle synergy</i> model is inevitably simplified, since only a fraction of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the hand can be recorded with surface EMG. Since all these factors may impact our ability to predict brain activity, we tested whether and to what extent different processing methods and EMG channel configurations could affect the performance of the <i>muscle synergy</i> model in discriminating single gestures and encoding brain activity. Therefore, we performed an additional analysis on an independent group of subjects, testing different processing methods and EMG channel configurations (up to 16 channels). The results, reported in the Appendix, demonstrate that EMG recordings with a higher dimensionality (<a href=\"#bib38\">Gazzoni et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Muceli et al., 2014</a>) or a different signal processing (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ejaz et al., 2015</a>) do not lead to better discrimination results. These findings are consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib73\">Muceli et al., 2014</a>), and indicate that, in the current study, the worst performance of the muscle model relates more to the signal-to-noise ratio of the EMG technique per se, rather than to shortcomings of either the acquisition device or the signal processing methods adopted here."

Additional studies are needed to investigate how topographical organization may be affected by the rotation of the principal components. Indeed, such an assessment requires the definition of stable population-level synergies to allow for the identification of optimally rotated components and to test their topographical arrangements across subjects; for this reason, it falls beyond the aims of the current study. Our work demonstrates that the topography of synergies, as defined as a spatial map of the first three PCs, is resistant to different arrangements; however, alternative configurations (rotated solutions within the PCA) can be encoded as well in sensorimotor cortical areas. The relatively low C index obtained in the mapping procedure and the total variance explained by the <i>kinematic synergy</i> model during the encoding procedure leave the door open to better models and different topographical arrangements."

                                "text": "In summary, our results provide strong support for the representation of hand motor acts through postural synergies. However, this does not imply that synergies are the only way the brain encodes hand movements in primary motor cortex. In our data, only a portion (40%) of the total brain activity could be accounted for by kinematic synergies. Hand motor control results from complex interactions involving the\u00a0integration of sensory feedback with the selection of motor commands to group of hand muscles. Similarly, motor planning is also a complex process, which requires selecting the desired final posture based on the contact forces required to grasp or manipulate an object. These elements must be continuously monitored to allow for on-line adaptation and corrections (<a href=\"#bib12\">Castiello, 2005</a>). Previous studies demonstrated that only a small fraction of variance in M1 is related to arm posture (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aflalo and Graziano, 2006</a>) and that grasping force can be efficiently decoded from electrical activity, suggesting that at least a subset of M1 neurons processes force-related information (<a href=\"#bib30\">Flint et al., 2014</a>). In addition, motor areas can combine individual digit patterns on the basis of alternative non-synergistic or nonlinear combinations and the correlated activity patterns for adjacent fingers may depend on alternative mechanisms such as finger enslaving (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ejaz et al., 2015</a>). It is likely that sensorimotor areas encode also different combinations of synergies, based \u2013 for instance \u2013 on the rotated versions of kinematic PCs: the encoding of synergies and of their rotated counterparts may represent a wider repertoire of motor primitives which can improve the flexibility and adaptability of modular control. Moreover, the information encoded may be related to the grasping action as a whole, not only to its final posture. Dimensionality reduction criteria can also be\u00a0applied to hand posture over time, leading to time-varying synergies that encode complete preshaping gestures without being limited to their final position (<a href=\"#bib100\">Tessitore et al., 2013</a>). This is consistent with EMG studies, which actually track muscle activity over the entire grasping trajectory (<a href=\"#bib108\">Weiss and Flanders, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cheung et al., 2009</a>) and can add information about the adjustments performed during a motor act. Information about the temporal sequence of posture and movements may therefore be encoded in M1 and a different experimental setup is needed to test this hypothesis."

The question about the role of M1 \u2013 i.e., whether it actually contains synergic information or simply act as a mere selector of motor primitives that are encoded elsewhere \u2013 still remains open. Our study provides a relatively coarse description of the role of M1 neurons. According to the redundancy principle, only a part of M1 neurons may be directly implied in movement or posture control (<a href=\"#bib67\">Latash et al., 2007</a>), whereas the remaining neurons may deal with force production or posture adjustments and control over time, allowing for the high flexibility and adaptability which are peculiar features of human hand movements."

To this purpose, we developed a rank accuracy measure within a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, as suggested by other authors to solve complex multiclass classification problems (<a href=\"#bib70\">Mitchell et al., 2004</a>). For each iteration of the procedure, each repetition of each stimulus was left out (<i>probe</i>), whereas all other repetitions (<i>test set</i>) were averaged. Then, we computed PCA on the data from the <i>test set</i>. The PCA transformation parameters were applied to transform the <i>probe</i> data in a leave-one-repetition-out way. Subsequently, we computed the Euclidean distance between the <i>probe</i> element and each element from <i>test</i> dataset. These distances were sorted, generating an ordered list of the potential gestures from the most to the least similar. The rank of the <i>probe</i> element in this sorted list was transformed in a percentage accuracy score. The procedure was iterated for each target gesture and repetition of the same grasping movement. The accuracy values were first averaged across repetitions and then across gestures, resulting in one averaged value for each subject. In this procedure, if an element is not discriminated above chance, it may fall in the middle of the ordered list (around position #10), which corresponds to an accuracy of 50%. For this reason, the chance level is always 50%, regardless of the number of gestures under consideration, while 100% of accuracy indicated that the correct gesture in the sorted list retained the highest score (i.e., the lowest distance, first ranked) across repetitions and participants."

The procedure was repeated 10,000 times, generating a null distribution of accuracies; the single-subject accuracy value was compared against this null distribution (one-sided rank test). This procedure was applied to the three models extracted from kinematic and EMG data, obtaining a measure of noise and stability across repetitions and each posture, as described by the three different approaches. Such validation procedure was therefore a necessary step to measure the information content of these three models before testing their ability to predict the fMRI signal."

For the analyses performed here, we chose models based on the first five principal components that were shown to explain more than 90% of the variance in previous reports, even if those models were applied on data with lower dimensionality (<a href=\"#bib87\">Santello et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Weiss and Flanders, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Gentner and Classen, 2006</a>). Moreover, an additional model was obtained from the postural data, thus leading to three different models with the same dimensionality (five dimensions): a <i>kinematic synergy</i> model (based on PCA applied to joint angles), an <i>individual digit</i> model (based on the average displacement of the digits), and a <i>muscle synergy</i> model (based on PCA applied to EMG features). However, to verify that the procedures applied here to reduce data dimensionality yielded the same results of those applied in previous works, we performed PCA by retaining variable numbers of components, from 1 to 10, and applied the above-described ranking procedure to test the accuracy of all data matrices. The plots of the accuracy values as a function of the number of PCs can be found in <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary files 1M</a> and in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>.

This procedure is aimed at predicting the activation pattern for a stimulus by computing a linear combination of synergy weights obtained from the behavioral models (i.e., Principal Components) with an algorithm previously trained on the activation images of a subset of stimuli (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The procedure consisted in 190 iterations of a leave-two-out cross-validation in which the stimuli were first partitioned in a training set (18 stimuli) and a test set with the two left-out examples. The sample for the analysis was then restricted to the 5000 voxels with the best average BOLD response across the 18 stimuli in the training set (expressed by the highest <i>t</i>-scores). For each iteration, the model was first trained with the vectorized patterns of fMRI coefficients of 18 stimuli associated with their known labels (i.e., the target objects). The training procedure employed a least-squares multiple linear regression to identify the set of parameters that, if applied to the five synergy weights, minimized the squared error in reconstructing the fMRI images from the training sample. After training the model, only the 1000 voxels that showed the highest R<sup>2</sup> (a measure of fitting between the matrix of synergy weights and the training data) were retained. A cluster size correction (nearest neighbor, size = 50 voxels) was also applied\u00a0to prune small, isolated clusters of voxels. The performance of the trained model was then assessed in a subsequent decoding stage by providing it with the fMRI images related to the two unseen gestures and their synergy weights, and requiring it to associate an fMRI pattern with the label of one of the left-out stimuli. The procedure was performed within the previously chosen 1000 voxels and accuracy was assessed by considering the correlation distance between the predicted and real fMRI patterns for each of the two unseen stimuli. This pairwise procedure led therefore to a number of correctly predicted fMRI patterns ranging from 0 to 2 with a chance level of 50%. This cross-validation loop was repeated 190 times, leaving out all the possible pairs of stimuli. Therefore, the results consisted of an overall accuracy value \u2013 the percentage of fMRI patterns correctly attributed, which is an expression of the success of the model in predicting brain signals \u2013 and a map of the voxels that were used in the procedure \u2013 i.e., the voxels whose signal was predictable on the basis of the synergy coefficients. Every voxel had a score ranging from 0 (if the voxel was never used) to a possible maximum of 380 (if the voxel was among the 1000 with the highest R<sup>2</sup> and the two left-out patterns could be predicted in all the 190 iterations). The encoding analysis was performed in separate procedures for each model \u2013 i.e., <i>kinematic</i> and <i>muscle synergies</i> and <i>individual digit</i>. We obtained, therefore, three sets of accuracy values and three maps of the most used voxels for each subject. These results, which displayed the brain regions whose activity was specifically modulated by the grasping action that was performed inside the scanner, were subsequently used for building the group-level probability maps (see below)."

The null distribution of accuracies was built with a loop in which the model was first trained with five randomly chosen synergy weights that were obtained by picking a random value out of the 18 (one for each gesture) in each column of the matrix of synergies. The trained model was subsequently tested on the two left-out images. The procedure was repeated 1000 times, leading to a null distribution of 1000 accuracy values against which we compared the value obtained from the above-described encoding method. Similarly to the encoding analysis, we did not use either the fMRI images or the synergy weights of the two test stimuli for training the model. The left-out examples were therefore tested by an algorithm that had been trained on a completely independent data sample. The weights were shuffled only <i>within column</i>: this procedure yielded vectors of shuffled weights with the same variance as the actual kinematic PCs, even though those vectors were no longer orthogonal. Permutation tests were performed separately for each subject with the three data matrices. Each single-subject accuracy was therefore tested against the null distribution of accuracy values obtained from the same subject data (one-sided rank test)."

The correlation of the two spaces is expressed by an index (C parameter) that reflects the similarity between the arrangement of voxels in space and the arrangement of their information content: high values indicate that voxels which contain similar information are also spatially close, suggesting a topographical organization.

One concern is that without any insight as to what the principal components represent, the demonstration that they show a topography is of limited value (Reviewer #2, first point). A second concern is whether the topography really reflects those components or would equally reflect components in other rotated versions of the space (Reviewer #1, Point #3).

The main finding is that the activity patterns of two left \u2013out postures can be better discriminated when using 5 regressors extracted from kinematic synergies than 5 regressors reflecting the unsigned displacement of individual fingers or 5 regressors picked from features of EMG recording of 5 different hand muscles. The conclusion of the study are largely overlapping with that of an earlier paper from our lab (Ejaz et al., 2015), but the study adds a number of interesting extra aspects to this line of work, including testing the generalisation of the model to new postures and the investigation of the spatial arrangement of these synergies onto the cortical sheet (but see point 3).

So, it leaves the reader with the question of whether there is something special about taking the absolute value, or about the specific rotation of these 5 factors in representational space. A more convincing line of investigation would be to try to use optimisation to rotated the 5 linear factors in the kinematic space as to get the best possible decoding performance, and then test the closeness of this solution with the one provided by the kinematic synergy model."

These may not always reflect individual muscles, but that is hardly important if we only want to obtain a representative picture of the space of muscle activity. The extracted features from the EMG signals appear obscure to me; and ultimately, the ability to distinguish between postures based on this data is very bad, indicating that most of these numbers reflect noise. Given these large a-priori differences in the quality of the models, I think any subsequent difference in how well fMRI activity patterns can be predicted become utterly unconvincing. So I think the authors need to work harder on trying to equate the reliability of their models (for a possible method, see Ejaz et al. (2015), supplementary methods)."

Therefore RSA and extraction of principal components from the covariance reflect highly related information \u2013 and I do not think that the authors have made any convincing case that anything can be learned from the PCA approach that cannot be learned from looking at the whole space. This boils down to the key question in the synergy field of whether there is something special about the principal vectors (or synergies) themselves, or just about the representational space they describe.

The problem, however, is that currently the one single mapping is not evaluated against many other possible mappings. Thus the authors have not shown that there is something special about the synergies extracted. For this, one would need to a) develop a measure of the \"topological orderliness\" of the mapping and b) compare the synergy map systematically against an exhaustive set of alternative rotations in the same space (again using optimisation). We actually attempted this analysis on our multi-finger experiment, but preliminary results were not terribly encouraging, as there seem to be rotations of these factors in the same rotational space which gave similarly orderly mappings. If the authors could show in a stringent and convincing fashion that the particular rotation chosen here is more orderly organised than any other possible rotation in the 3-dimensional space (or even conclude after careful evaluation that this is not the case), I think the paper would really increase in quality.

Moreover, the better results achieved by using the feature-based approach, as compared to the procedure suggested by the Reviewer, may indicate that feature extraction represent a better technique for exploiting the advantages of EMG setups with higher spatial resolution, consistent with the data already present in the literature (Hudgins et al., 1993; Zecca et al., 2002)."

However, a well-consolidated assumption is that the instantaneous value of the EMG signal contains little or no information (Zecca et al., 2002). In addition, during complex movements the temporal structure of the EMG signal varies to a great deal. This makes the most elementary frequency or amplitude-based parameters (e.g. mean absolute value, median frequency) not sufficient for the classification of complex movements: an accurate classification may instead benefit very much from a greater number of signal descriptors (Hudgins et al., 1993). For this reason, the extraction of time-domain or frequency domain features is widely applied when EMG signals are used to classify distinct hand gestures."

The features chosen in our study are commonly employed for classifying gestures from EMG recordings of hand muscles (for instance, see Zecca et al., 2002; Boostani and Moradi, 2003; Tkach et al., 2010; Kendell et al., 2012; Chowdhury et al., 2013).

Maximizing the first synergy leads therefore to a posture resembling a power grasp, while the second one is linked to pinch movements directed towards smaller objects. In our study, we examined the first two PCs, which were highly consistent with the literature, along with a third one representing a movement of flexion and thumb opposition (as to grasp a dish or a platter).

Thus the authors have not shown that there is something special about the synergies extracted.

To rule out such potential confounds and to verify that synergies modulate brain activity exclusively in sensorimotor regions, we considered visual activations vs. rest (measured five seconds after visual stimulus presentation) and performed the encoding procedure on the resulting mask. This procedure, along with the encoding of visual-related responses in sensorimotor regions originally included in the paper, has been described in a new section (Control analyses) in the Results section. The results show that both early activity in motor regions and activity in extrastriate visual regions do not encode kinematic synergies above-chance, excluding therefore those imagery-related confounds."

The individual digit model was based on the paper by Kirsch and colleagues (Kirsch et al., 2014), which compared the firing rate of M1 neurons with individual finger kinematics and with their Principal Components. In our paper, we described the individual digit model as somatotopic because a somatotopic arrangement requires the presence of discrete, independent single digit representations at a neuronal level. If the discharge pattern of a M1 neuron is correlated with individual digit kinematics, that neuron can be labeled as digit specific. Thus, following the Reviewer\u2019s comment, we removed the potentially misleading references to somatotopy in the description of the individual digit model."
