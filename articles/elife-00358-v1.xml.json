A gain of function screen for genes that enable proliferation independently of matrix anchorage identified a cell adhesion molecule PVRL4 (poliovirus-receptor-like 4), also known as Nectin-4. PVRL4 promotes anchorage-independence by driving cell-to-cell attachment and matrix-independent integrin \u03b24/SHP-2/c-Src activation. Solid tumors frequently have copy number gains of the PVRL4 locus and some have focal amplifications. We demonstrate that the transformation of breast cancer cells is dependent on PVRL4. Furthermore, growth of orthotopically implanted tumors in vivo is inhibited by blocking PVRL4-driven cell-to-cell attachment with monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating a novel strategy for targeted therapy of cancer."

A gain of function screen for genes that enable proliferation independently of matrix anchorage identified a cell adhesion molecule PVRL4 (poliovirus-receptor-like 4), also known as Nectin-4. PVRL4 promotes anchorage-independence by driving cell-to-cell attachment and matrix-independent integrin \u03b24/SHP-2/c-Src activation. Solid tumors frequently have copy number gains of the PVRL4 locus and some have focal amplifications. We demonstrate that the transformation of breast cancer cells is dependent on PVRL4. Furthermore, growth of orthotopically implanted tumors in vivo is inhibited by blocking PVRL4-driven cell-to-cell attachment with monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating a novel strategy for targeted therapy of cancer."

These layers provide inner linings to various cavities and hollow organs throughout the body\u2014including the lungs and glandular organs such as mammary glands. A single-cell layer of epithelium is separated from the tissues beneath it by a supporting substance called the extracellular matrix. The individual cells within a single-cell layer are physically attached to the matrix, and when displaced from it, they promptly undergo programmed cell death. This mechanism preserves the single-cell layer pattern throughout the body and prevents epithelial cells from growing in inappropriate locations."

Epithelia have a distinct ability to form and maintain highly organized monolayers, which is reflected in their role in providing the inner lining of hollow organs. This unique architecture is dictated by the requirement for an epithelial cell to be physically anchored on a basement membrane, an organizing substratum composed of specific extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Cells physically attach to ECM via integrins, a class of signaling molecules that serve to stimulate the survival and proliferation of cells in a matrix attachment-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hynes, 2002</a>). Conversely, loss of contact with the proper ECM molecules results in initiation of a cell death program known as anoikis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Frisch and Screaton, 2001</a>), and other constraints on cellular expansion."

Though acquired early, the ability to tolerate the loss of anchorage remains critical for the survival of cancer cells throughout the course of disease progression, encompassing stages such as invasion of the underlying stroma, extravasation into blood vessels, survival in the bloodstream, and, eventually, metastatic outgrowth at a distant site with a distinct matrix composition."

                        "text": "Along with the loss of the requirement for anchorage, a propensity for self-aggregation is a characteristic of aggressive cancer cells. Thus, tumor-derived subclones with greater metastatic capacity in vivo display increased self-aggregation in vitro; at the same time, subclones selected for increased in vitro aggregation were found to be more metastatic in mice (<a href=\"#bib40\">Updyke and Nicolson, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Saiki et al., 1991</a>). Invasion of the underlying stroma is frequently undertaken by large groups of tumor cells, a phenomenon known as collective, or cohort, cell migration (<a href=\"#bib13\">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</a>). Clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been identified from the blood samples of breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer patients as well as from mouse tumor models (<a href=\"#bib30\">Molnar et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Stott et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hou et al., 2011</a>). In particular, one report demonstrated that, on average, 50% of all breast and lung CTCs exist in circulation as aggregates (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cho et al., 2012</a>). An increase in clustering behavior is not limited to self-aggregation, as interactions with a variety of other cell types have been shown to be essential for the dissemination of cancer cells and subsequent metastatic colonization. Thus, heterotypic interactions of cancer cells with the endothelial lining within the target organ microvasculature were documented as an initiating event for metastatic lesion formation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Mehdi et al., 2000</a>). Moreover, signaling elicited by the physical association of cancer cells with other cell types, such as platelets and macrophages, has been demonstrated to be essential for successful seeding and metastatic outgrowth (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Labelle et al., 2011</a>). Taken together, tumor-specific cell\u2013cell contacts can provide a multifaceted survival advantage throughout the course of pathologic progression. Targeted therapies directed towards blocking such cell\u2013cell contacts may therefore represent a novel cancer treatment approach."

Our screen identified a cell adhesion molecule PVRL4 (poliovirus receptor-like 4), also known as Nectin-4, which we demonstrate to be a potent mediator of anchorage-independent colony formation in normal epithelial and cancer cells alike. We demonstrate that PVRL4 promotes the attachment of individual cells to each other via engaging its receptor PVRL1 on a juxtaposed cell. PVRL4-mediated cell-to-cell attachment triggers integrin \u03b24 signaling in a matrix attachment-independent manner, and interfering with this pathway blocks PVRL4-driven anchorage-independence. Our findings point to a model in which signaling via PVRL4-PVRL1-driven cell\u2013cell contacts serves as a surrogate for cell\u2013matrix signaling in conditions of anchorage loss, thus enabling anoikis evasion and subsequent cellular expansion."

Similarly to other nectins, PVRL4 contains an extracellular region with three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (<a href=\"#bib34\">Reymond et al., 2001</a>). Extracellular regions of nectins engage in <i>trans</i>-interactions on the interface of two juxtaposed cells. Through a stretch of four C-terminal amino acids, <i>trans</i>-interacting nectins recruit afadin, a scaffold-like mediator of downstream signaling, triggering assembly of the afadin/Rap1/p120<sup>ctn</sup> complex, which positively regulates membrane retention of E-cadherin, assisting in adherens junction (AJ) formation in MDCK cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hoshino et al., 2005</a>)."

To address this, we mixed equal numbers of dsRed- and GFP-labeled TL-HMECs expressing PVRL4 and (i) seeded them into methylcellulose or (ii) co-cultured the mixed population on an adherent surface, subsequently seeding them into methylcellulose. Examining the colors of resulting colonies revealed that out of 56 colonies from sample (i), all 56 were single-color colonies, whereas in sample (ii), 39 out of 40 colonies were single-color, and only one colony contained both GFP and dsRed-positive cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Therefore, we sought a physical means by which to disrupt PVRL4-induced cell-to-cell attachment to examine its effects on colony formation. We asked whether antibodies directed towards the extracellular domain of PVRL4 could block PVRL4-induced cluster formation and anchorage-independent growth. Cell clustering was completely abrogated in the presence of three independent PVRL4 antibodies, whereas control IgG or a blocking antibody against E-cadherin (DECMA-1) did not produce such an effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Similarly, an antibody targeting the extracellular region of PVRL1 inhibited PVRL4-induced cell clustering (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). PVRL4-driven colony formation was inhibited to almost a basal level in the presence of a monoclonal antibody targeting the extracellular region of PVRL4, but no such effect was observed on colonies induced by PTEN shRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), demonstrating that the observed inhibition is due to a direct effect of an antibody and not due to its general toxicity. Our data indicate that PVRL4 enables anchorage-independent growth in a manner which is dependent on PVRL4-PVRL1-driven cell-to-cell attachment, suggesting that these intercellular contacts may be providing a survival benefit in the context of altered matrix anchorage."

To address this question, we created chimeric constructs in which extracellular regions of PVRL1 and PVRL4 were fused to the transmembrane regions of an unrelated transmembrane molecule, CD8 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and the cytoplasmic regions of both molecules were deleted. We first introduced PVRL4-CD8tm into TL-HMECs, concomitantly depleting endogenous PVRL1 by RNAi (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Membrane localization of the chimeric construct was verified by immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Expression of PVRL4-CD8tm induced both cell clustering and anchorage-independent colony formation, and both phenotypes were suppressed by stable depletion of endogenous PVRL1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Importantly, clustering was restored when two populations of clustering-incompetent cells, PVRL4-CD8tm expressing, PVRL1-depleted cells (PVRL4<sup>+</sup>; PVRL1<sup>\u2212</sup>) and control cells (PVRL4<sup>\u2212</sup>; PVRL1<sup>+</sup>), were mixed together, independently verifying that cell-to-cell attachment is mediated by the PVRL4-PVRL1 <i>trans</i>-interacting module (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Both cell clustering and colony formation defects induced by PVRL1 shRNA were rescued by the expression of the shRNA-resistant PVRL1-CD8tm construct. Taken together, these data indicate an on-target nature of the PVRL1 depletion phenotype and demonstrate that ability to withstand the absence of anchorage is driven by the PVRL4-PVRL1 cell-surface <i>trans</i>-interaction and not by intracellular or transmembrane regions of either molecule."

Along these lines, we hypothesized that other oncogenic perturbations that drive anchorage-independent growth (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) may also promote cell-to-cell attachment as a part of their survival strategy. Either expression of mutant Ras<sup>V12</sup>, or myristoylated PI3K catalytic subunit (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), or shRNA-mediated depletion of PTEN (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>; for depletion efficiencies see <a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) triggered multicellular cluster formation in TL-HMECs. None of the perturbations induced endogenous PVRL4 expression, as measured by FACS (not shown), which suggests that clustering in these cases was mediated through other adhesion mechanisms. Mixing PTEN shRNA-expressing GFP-labeled cells with control shRNA-expressing dsRed-labeled cells triggered the formation of multicellular clusters that contained both GFP- and dsRed-labeled cells (<a href=\"#fig4s7\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 7</a>), demonstrating that, in a manner similar to PVRL4, depletion of PTEN enabled attachment of TL-HMECs to cells that do not carry the perturbation as well as those that do. Taken together, these observations suggest that increased cell-to-cell attachment is a phenotype that multiple oncogenic perturbations converge upon."

Neither of the two molecules possesses catalytic activity; in addition, our data show that transmembrane as well as cytoplasmic regions are dispensable for anchorage-independence. Therefore, we considered the possibility that the assembly of a PVRL4-PVRL1 interacting module on the interface of two neighboring cells may be triggering lateral recruitment and/or activation of cell surface-localized proteins, which, in turn, conveys a prosurvival signal. To identify potential cell surface-localized binding partners of PVRL4, we created a C-terminally HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 construct and first verified that cell\u2013cell clustering as well as anchorage-independent growth phenotypes were not affected by the addition of a C-terminal tag (not shown). We then performed immunoprecipitations with anti-HA agarose beads from lysates of TL-HMECs induced to express either HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 or HA/FLAG-tagged GFP and subjected the eluates to tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Since only the extracellular regions of PVRL4 and PVRL1 are required for anchorage-independent colony formation, we searched the list of PVRL4 IP-specific peptides for those that had at least three unique peptides corresponding to cell surface-localized proteins, as classified by Gene Ontology. We identified the transmembrane protein integrin \u03b24 as specifically interacting with HA/FLAG-PVRL4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). To validate the putative PVRL4\u2013integrin \u03b24 interaction directly in cells under conditions of anchorage deprivation, we performed immunoprecipitations with anti-HA beads from lysates of suspension-incubated TL-HMECs that expressed either HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 or HA/FLAG-tagged GFP. Immunoblotting for integrin \u03b24 verified a specific association of integrin \u03b24 with PVRL4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We next asked if the integrin \u03b24\u2013PVRL4 association was affected by cell clustering. The same amount of integrin \u03b24 coprecipitated with HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 from lysates prepared from multicellular clusters and from single-cell suspension. Similarly, the amount of coprecipitating integrin \u03b24 was not affected by RNAi-mediated depletion of PVRL1 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These data point to a <i>cis</i> mode of association between PVRL4 and integrin \u03b24 on the membrane of the same cell."

Levels of activated SFK dropped precipitously in control cells while remaining high in PVRL4-expressing cells but not in PVRL4-expressing, PVRL1-depleted cells.

A similar effect was observed after a short-term incubation of PVRL4-expressing TL-HMECs in suspension (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), where levels of SFK activation observed in freshly detached cells (0 hr time point) were maintained in cells that were allowed to attach to each other but not in cells in which clustering was prevented by either anti-PVRL4 antibody or PVRL1 depletion."

Since PVRL4-driven anchorage-independent growth is inhibited both by integrin \u03b24 depletion and by chemical inhibition of SFK activity, we reasoned that depletion of SHP-2 might have a similar effect. Indeed, two independent shRNAs against SHP-2 completely abrogated colony formation induced by PVRL4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>). Taken together, these data suggest that PVRL4-driven anchorage-independent growth is facilitated via activation of the integrin \u03b24/SHP-2/Src signaling pathway in a manner that is dependent on cell-to-cell attachment."

We first focused on an inflammatory breast tumor cell line SUM190, which contains a particularly high-level focal amplification (\u223c50 kb) of the <i>PVRL4</i> genomic locus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beroukhim et al., 2010</a>). To ask whether PVRL4 is involved in enabling anchorage-independent growth of these cells, we designed four independent shRNAs targeting PVRL4 and stably expressed them in SUM190 cells, confirming the extent of depletion by RT-qPCR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Paralleling effects seen in TL-HMECs, spontaneous self-clustering of SUM190 cells was abrogated by anti-PVRL4 antibodies (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) or by RNAi against PVRL4 (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Similarly, heterotypic attachment of SUM190 cells with human lung microvascular endothelial (HMVEC-L) cells was prevented by anti-PVRL4 antibodies (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and by RNAi (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). RNAi against PVRL4 potently reduced both anchorage-independent colony formation and clonogenic growth of SUM190 cells, indicating that PVRL4 is involved in the growth and survival of breast cancer cells. Importantly, observed effects correlated with the degree of RNAi-mediated mRNA depletion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). To verify that the effects of PVRL4 depletion are not limited to SUM190 cells, we expressed anti-PVRL4 shRNAs in two additional breast cancer cell lines, Sk-BR-3 and BT-474 (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), which both express lower levels of PVRL4 than SUM190 cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fabre-Lafay et al., 2007</a>), and observed a strong defect in clonogenic growth (<a href=\"#fig6s6\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) and reduced proliferation in the absence of anchorage (<a href=\"#fig6s7\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 7</a>)."

To address this, we treated mice bearing \u223c50 mm<sup>3</sup> SUM190-eGFP xenografts with four consecutive intravenous injections of either anti-PVRL4 monoclonal antibody or isotype control IgG at 15 mg/kg each. After the last treatment, we continued to monitor tumor growth for the next 7 days. Whereas tumor volumes in the control group steadily increased over time, the PVRL4 antibody-treated group displayed a remarkable stalling of tumor growth throughout the course of the injection regimen (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Immunoblotting of tumor lysates revealed that PVRL4 antibody treatment resulted in a precipitous decline of PVRL4 protein levels, suggesting that cells with the highest expression of PVRL4 were eliminated by the treatment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Dissection of excised xenografts revealed a softer, paste-like composition of PVRL4 antibody-treated tumors compared to the more solid consistency of control-treated samples. This latter observation was corroborated by histological analysis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>), which revealed areas of widespread necrosis and, importantly, loss of cell contacts (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013F</a>) when compared to control IgG-treated tumors (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). Finally, examination of three-dimensional tumor architecture in control- and anti-PVRL4 antibody-treated tumors by two-photon confocal microscopy revealed reduced cell\u2013cell contacts in anti-PVRL4 antibody-treated samples as compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The loss of cell contacts and necrosis observed in treated tumors supports our model of PVRL4-driven cell-to-cell attachments conferring ability to sustain growth in conditions of matrix anchorage loss."

To address this, we measured levels of E-cadherin (an epithelial marker) and vimentin (a mesenchymal marker) in SUM190 xenografts treated with anti-PVRL4 antibody in vivo (<a href=\"#fig7s5\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>) as well as in cultured SUM190 cells in which PVRL4 expression was inhibited by RNAi (<a href=\"#fig7s5\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>).

Among normal mouse tissues, PVRL4 expression is strongest in cornea and skin epidermis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wu et al., 2009</a>). The skin surface of mice treated with anti-PVRL4 antibodies was not visibly affected by treatment, and mice appeared healthy overall, demonstrating that targeted therapy against PVRL4 does not induce acute side effects in this organism.

Cytoplasmic regions of nectins recruit afadin, a large scaffold protein involved in mediating intracellular signaling. Interestingly, and in contrast to PVRL4, loss of afadin has been shown to be strongly associated with poor outcome in breast cancer patients in a number of studies (<a href=\"#bib25\">Letessier et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fournier et al., 2011</a>). Supporting our findings in TL-HMECs, we found that PVRL4 is required for clonogenic and anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells in vitro as well as growth of orthotopically implanted tumors in vivo. In lung cancer cells, siRNA-mediated depletion of PVRL4 was shown to negatively affect adherent growth and motility (<a href=\"#bib39\">Takano et al., 2009</a>), highlighting the functional role of PVRL4 across multiple cancer types. Importantly, we were able to reverse the clonogenic defect by expressing a chimeric construct consisting of the extracellular region of PVRL4 fused to the transmembrane domain of CD8, independently verifying that its function is carried out via an extracellular route."

Specifically, we identify integrin \u03b24 as a <i>cis</i>-interacting partner of PVRL4 and demonstrate that anchorage-independent growth driven by PVRL4 requires intact integrin \u03b24/SHP-2/SFK signaling. An extensive array of evidence functionally links integrin \u03b24 to breast tumorigenesis. Similarly to PVRL4, integrin \u03b24 expression is associated with poor prognosis and a basal-like expression profile (<a href=\"#bib9\">Diaz et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lu et al., 2008</a>), and targeting integrin \u03b24 with RNAi was shown to inhibit anchorage-independent growth, invasion, and xenograft growth in breast cancer cell lines (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lipscomb et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bon et al., 2006</a>). Integrin \u03b24 is thought to exhibit a significant degree of signaling autonomy compared to other integrins, due to its atypically long C-terminus which serves as a scaffold for its downstream effectors. This signaling autonomy was convincingly demonstrated in a study utilizing chimeric constructs where extracellular and transmembrane regions of integrin \u03b24 were substituted with those on the TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase. Dimerization of two such chimeric molecules on the cell surface by adding TrkB ligand, BDNF, was sufficient to drive SFK activation, in a manner dependent on SHP-2 phosphatase (<a href=\"#bib29\">Merdek et al., 2007</a>). <i>Trans</i>-interactions of cell adhesion molecules are thought to trigger the formation of tightly packed zippers of interacting cell adhesion molecules at a cell\u2013cell contact interface (<a href=\"#bib41\">Walmod et al., 2004</a>). One possibility is that <i>trans</i>-interacting PVRL4 and PVRL1 similarly organize into zippers at sites of cell\u2013cell contact, driving individual integrin \u03b24 molecules into proximity sufficient for their activation. Matrix attachment-independent activation of integrin molecules may then allow sustained SHP-2/SFK signaling sufficient for counteracting the growth-restrictive consequences of anchorage loss."

Interestingly, we found that multiple oncogenic perturbations facilitate increased intercellular adhesiveness. It remains to be further elucidated whether, and through what mechanisms, the increased ability to form contacts functionally contributes to anchorage-independent growth or other tumorigenesis-associated phenotypes in each of these instances. Increased clustering has been previously associated with greater metastatic capacity (<a href=\"#bib40\">Updyke and Nicolson, 1986</a>), raising an interesting possibility that increased cell\u2013cell adhesiveness is a generalized mechanism that tumor cells employ as a part of their survival strategy. It is possible that while loss of cell adhesion during EMT facilitates invasiveness, it concomitantly places cells under the stress of anchorage deprivation, compromising their survival. Thus, cancer cells may need to replace the loss of homotypic cell\u2013cell contacts with weaker heterotypic interactions capable of promoting survival in the absence of anchorage."

This is particularly relevant for PVRL4 as 100% of breast tumors from patients with two or more lymph nodes that are positive for cancer cells express PVRL4 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Athanassiadou et al., 2011</a>). In addition, we demonstrate that PVRL4 can promote the attachment of cancer cells to other cell types. For example, SUM190 breast cancer cells readily attach to lung endothelial cells (HMVEC-Ls), and inhibiting PVRL4 with RNAi or with blocking antibodies abolishes this interaction. CTC-targeted therapy is a promising new treatment possibility, and it will be of particular interest to investigate the potential role of PVRL4 in mediating these types of interactions in vivo."

In vitro, we found that such blocking antibodies suppress PVRL4-driven cellular growth and Src family kinase activation in the absence of anchorage, and in vivo, anti-PVRL4 antibody treatment potently inhibited the growth of orthotopically implanted primary tumors. Importantly, post-antibody therapy tumor samples uniformly exhibit marked downregulation of PVRL4, confirming that the observed response is target-specific and not a consequence of a non-specific antitumor effect of the antibody. In addition, we found no difference in the degree of host macrophage recruitment or in vitro ADCC induction between control IgG and anti-PVRL4 antibodies. These observations suggest that the observed tumor growth inhibition is likely due to a direct inhibition of cell-to-cell attachment mediated by PVRL4-PVRL1 binding, and not due to an Fc receptor-mediated immune response. It remains to be tested whether a stronger inhibitory effect could be achieved with an antibody that is both ADCC-competent and capable of inhibiting PVRL4-driven cell clustering."

Peptides were then assembled into proteins and further filtered to a protein-level FDR of 0.84% (<a href=\"#bib18\">Huttlin et al., 2010</a>), resulting in a final peptide-level FDR of 0.35%."

A cDNA for PVRL4/Nectin-4 was repeatedly recovered from this screen. PVRL4 not only caused anchorage-independent growth but also caused strong aggregation of the TL-HMEC cells. They note copy number gains of the genomic region encompassing PVRL4 in some cases of human breast cancer (\u223c8%). Knockdown of PVRL4 decreased clonogenic survival of one breast cancer line with PVRL4 amplification in the absence of stroma and delayed tumor progression in xenografts. An antibody to PVRL4 decreased xenograft progression, apparently by preventing cell-cell adhesive contacts."

As the reviewers point out, in the 650-tumor dataset from the Oncomine database, arrayCGH data indicate that PVRL4 in tumors is affected mostly by low-level copy gains, but not by high-level amplifications that are seen for HER2 and CCND1. In agreement with the Oncomine dataset, another cancer genomic alterations database, <a href=\"http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/\">cBioportal</a>, which we cite in our manuscript, similarly indicates that PVRL4 is less often affected by high-level amplifications than HER2. However, we do not completely agree with the reviewers\u2019 statement that cBioportal \u201cdoes not distinguish high-level amplification from single copy gain\u201d. Indeed, in cBioportal, an <a href=\"http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/faq.jsp#what-do-2-1-0-1-and-2-mean-in-the-copy-number-data\">arbitrary score</a> is assigned to indicate the amplitude of a genomic alteration that involves the gene of interest, with \u201c0\u201d indicating a diploid status, \u201c1\u201d a low-level copy gain, and \u201c2\u201d a high-level amplification."

To address the reviewers\u2019 concerns, we have changed the wording we use to describe the genomic status of PVRL4 and expanded our statement on the status of PVRL4 in tumors to reflect the data more accurately: \u201cAnalysis of a publicly available dataset of copy number alterations involving PVRL4 in 484 breast tumors indicates a low-level copy number gain in 60.3% of samples, and high-level amplification in another 7.9% of samples\u201d."

We opted not to test the effect of an anti-PVRL4 antibody treatment on BT-474 xenografts due to the costs associated with performing an additional antibody experiment in mice, and focused on testing effects of RNAi-mediated depletion of PVRL4 in this line instead, as suggested. Indeed, we found that xenograft growth of BT-474 cells was markedly sensitive to PVRL4 depletion, which was similar to what we have observed with SUM190 and SUM185 cell lines. Altogether, our data indicate that tumors with high PVRL4 and those with intermediate expression of PVRL4 may be sensitive to anti-PVRL4 therapy."
