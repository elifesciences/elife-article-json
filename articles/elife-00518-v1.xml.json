                    "text": "The insulin-like signaling pathway maintains a relatively short wild-type lifespan in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, the ortholog of the FOXO transcription factors of mammalian cells. DAF-16 is phosphorylated by the AKT kinases, preventing its nuclear translocation. Calcineurin (PP2B phosphatase) also limits the lifespan of <i>C. elegans</i>, but the mechanism through which it does so is unknown. Herein, we show that TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 and UNC-43, the <i>C. elegans</i> Calcineurin and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CAMKII) orthologs, respectively, also regulate lifespan through DAF-16. Moreover, UNC-43 regulates DAF-16 in response to various stress conditions, including starvation, heat or oxidative stress, and cooperatively contributes to lifespan regulation by insulin signaling. However, unlike insulin signaling, UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, thus promoting its nuclear localization. The phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6\u2022CNB-1, leading to DAF-16 inactivation. Mammalian FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMKIIA and Calcineurin."

DAF-16 is phosphorylated by the AKT kinases, preventing its nuclear translocation. Calcineurin (PP2B phosphatase) also limits the lifespan of <i>C. elegans</i>, but the mechanism through which it does so is unknown. Herein, we show that TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 and UNC-43, the <i>C. elegans</i> Calcineurin and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CAMKII) orthologs, respectively, also regulate lifespan through DAF-16. Moreover, UNC-43 regulates DAF-16 in response to various stress conditions, including starvation, heat or oxidative stress, and cooperatively contributes to lifespan regulation by insulin signaling. However, unlike insulin signaling, UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, thus promoting its nuclear localization. The phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6\u2022CNB-1, leading to DAF-16 inactivation. Mammalian FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMKIIA and Calcineurin."

The best characterized is the IIS pathway, which includes the upstream insulin/IGF-1 receptor DAF-2 and the downstream FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Signals from DAF-2 are transmitted through AGE-1 (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositol-dependent kinase-1) to AKT-1, AKT-2, and SGK-1, which phosphorylate DAF-16 and prevent it from translocating to the nucleus to activate a pro-longevity gene network. Reduction-of-function mutations of the kinase genes in the IIS pathway, from <i>daf-2</i> to <i>akt-1</i>, <i>akt-2,</i> and <i>sgk-1</i>, all extend lifespan in a <i>daf-16</i>-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kenyon et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Morris et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kimura et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hertweck et al., 2004</a>). Lifespan extension by reduced IIS is also observed in other species, including flies and mice, indicating that the pathway is conserved evolutionarily (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kenyon, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Greer and Brunet, 2008</a>)."

The only known example is PPTR-1, a B56 regulatory subunit of PP2A, which directs PP2A to dephosphorylate AKT-1 at T350, thereby inactivating the kinase (<a href=\"#bib41\">Padmanabhan et al., 2009</a>). DAF-18, the <i>C. elegans</i> PTEN, is a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) 3-phosphatase (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ogg and Ruvkun, 1998</a>). The phosphatase for DAF-2 has not been identified, nor the one that regulates DAF-16. Previously, <i>loss-of-function (lf)</i> mutants for <i>tax-6</i> and <i>cnb-1</i>, which encode the catalytic and regulatory subunits of <i>C. elegans</i> Calcineurin, respectively, were found to live longer than wild-type (WT) worms (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dong et al., 2007</a>). In mammalian systems, Calcineurin (PP2B) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that has diverse functions and affects both T cell activation and heart development (<a href=\"#bib7\">Crabtree, 1999</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i>, Calcineurin regulates body size, thermotaxis, muscle contraction, and lifespan (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kuhara et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dong et al., 2007</a>). The longevity phenotype of <i>tax-6(lf)</i> is partially dependent on <i>daf-16</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dong et al., 2007</a>). More recent studies have shown that <i>C. elegans</i> Calcineurin can regulate lifespan by suppressing autophagy (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dwivedi et al., 2009</a>) or inactivating CRTC-1, a co-activator of CREB (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mair et al., 2011</a>).

We discovered that DAF-16 was phosphorylated and activated by UNC-43 at the serine 286 (S286) site. The phosphoryl group was removed by TAX-6\u2022CNB-1. UNC-43 and TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 therefore regulate <i>C. elegans</i> lifespan through the reversible phosphorylation of DAF-16. This regulatory mechanism has a different mode of action from the canonical IIS pathway because the phosphorylation activates, rather than represses, DAF-16. Activation of DAF-16 by UNC-43 occurs in response to different types of stress signals, such as heat, starvation, and oxidation. UNC-43 and TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 can regulate DAF-16 independently of IIS, and the two signaling mechanisms appear to crosstalk, leading to coordinated action on DAF-16. We also show that the regulation of FOXO by CAMKII and Calcineurin is conserved in mammalian cells."

This observation suggested that <i>daf-16</i> is either a direct or indirect downstream target of <i>C. elegans</i> Calcineurin; alternatively, it acts independently. To sort through these possibilities, we immunoprecipitated the 3xFLAG::DAF-16 protein using an anti-FLAG antibody from the lysate of MQD82, a transgenic worm strain that expresses this fusion protein and TAX-6::GFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lane 1). TAX-6::GFP from this lysate was co-precipitated with the FLAG antibody (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lane 4), but no TAX-6::GFP was co-precipitated from the lysate of MQD2, a strain expressing only TAX-6::GFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lanes 2 and 5). From the mixed lysates of two other transgenic strains, one expressing 3xFLAG::DAF-16 and the other expressing GFP, the GFP protein also failed to be precipitated by the FLAG antibody (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lanes 3 and 6). This result suggested that TAX-6 and DAF-16 interacted with each other in vivo. To determine whether the interaction was direct, we individually purified the recombinant His-tagged DAF-16 and <i>C. elegans</i> Calcineurin in the form of TAX-6\u2022GST-CNB-1 and then mixed them together before pulling down DAF-16 with nickel beads. Indeed, TAX-6\u2022GST-CNB-1 was pulled down successfully using His-tagged DAF-16 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Further analysis suggested that the C-terminal region of DAF-16 mediates the interaction with Calcineurin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Together, these results raised the interesting possibility that Calcineurin might directly regulate DAF-16 in <i>C. elegans</i>."

This result is in contrast to the transmission of IIS signaling to DAF-16, during which phosphorylation of DAF-16 by AKT inhibits its nuclear accumulation. Thus, AKT and Calcineurin regulate the phosphorylation of different sites on DAF-16; otherwise, <i>tax-6(lf)</i> would have a lifespan phenotype opposite to that of <i>akt-1;akt-2(lf)</i> or <i>daf-2(lf)</i>.

While DAF-16::6xHis::GFP accumulated in the nuclei of <i>tax-6(lf)</i> and <i>unc-43(gf)</i> mutants, DAF-16(S286A)::6xHis::GFP distributed diffusely throughout the cell in the same mutant backgrounds (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>), and the pattern resembled that of DAF-16::6xHis::GFP in WT worms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i> whose WT copy of DAF-16 was replaced by DAF-16(S286A), the lifespan extension by either <i>unc-43(gf)</i> or <i>tax-6(lf)</i> was greatly suppressed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1A,B</a>).

Therefore, UNC-43 and TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 most likely respond to conditions that are distinct from the conditions sensed by AKT in the IIS pathway. In addition to mutations that reduce insulin signaling, various stress conditions, including thermal stress, oxidative stress, and starvation, can trigger translocation of DAF-16 to the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib15\">Henderson and Johnson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lin et al., 2001</a>).

                                "text": "The site of DAF-16 that is phosphorylated by CAMKII is different from the site that is phosphorylated by AKT. Moreover, phosphorylation by AKT and CAMKII has opposite effects on DAF-16 activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5 and 6</a> and <a href=\"#bib32\">Lin et al., 2001</a>). Thus, the IIS pathway (DAF-2) and the CAMKII pathway might work in parallel. In agreement with this hypothesis, reduced IIS and increased phosphorylation of DAF-16 S286, either by <i>unc-43(gf)</i> or <i>tax-6(lf)</i>, displayed an additive effect on lifespan (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1A</a>). These two pathways, however, also seem to crosstalk. First, an <i>unc-43</i> null allele shortened the <i>daf-2</i> lifespan by 31% (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1B</a>), indicating that <i>unc-43</i> is required for full lifespan extension by <i>daf-2(e1370)</i>. This result suggests that part of the signaling from DAF-2 is mediated by UNC-43. However, phosphorylation of DAF-16 S286 seems nonessential for the longevity of <i>daf-2</i> animals (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1C</a>), suggesting that an additional UNC-43 target(s) is involved in DAF-2 signaling. Second, in the constitutively active <i>unc-43(gf)</i> mutant, which has increased phosphorylation on DAF-16 S286 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), phosphorylation by AKT on T240 is greatly reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Therefore, in long-lived <i>unc-43(gf)</i> animals, phosphorylation on these two residues appears to be coordinated, but it is unclear how this coordination occurs. The AKT kinase activity may be reduced in <i>unc-43(gf)</i>, or phospho-S286 DAF-16 may be a poor substrate for AKT. In either case, dampened phosphorylation on the AKT site may be expected to prevent DAF-16 from forming a complex with the 14-3-3 protein, which has been shown to bind to and sequester AKT-phosphorylated FOXO (DAF-16 or mammalian FOXO3) in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brunet et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Berdichevsky et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2007</a>). Consistently, we found that <i>unc-43(gf)</i> reduced the amount of DAF-16-associated 14-3-3 without affecting the total amount of 14-3-3 (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). It remains to be seen whether S286 phosphorylation directly or indirectly promotes DAF-16 nuclear accumulation."

To genetically mimic this scenario, we combined <i>daf-2</i> RNAi with either <i>unc-43(null)</i> or <i>tax-6(jh107)</i>, a constitutively active <i>tax-6(gf)</i> allele in which the autoinhibitory domain was deleted (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2004</a>). DAF-16::GFP was cytoplasmic in <i>unc-43(null)</i> or <i>tax-6(gf)</i>, but nuclear DAF-16::GFP was clearly visible above the cytoplasmic background in <i>daf-2(RNAi)</i>, <i>daf-2(RNAi);unc-43(null)</i>, or <i>daf-2(RNAi);tax-6(gf)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We also combined <i>daf-18</i> RNAi, which enhances IIS to inhibit DAF-16 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ogg and Ruvkun, 1998</a>), with <i>unc-43(gf)</i> or <i>tax-6(lf)</i>, which activates DAF-16. In both cases, the nuclear accumulation induced by <i>unc-43(gf)</i> or <i>tax-6(lf)</i> was greatly diminished by <i>daf-18</i> RNAi (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>).

Next, we asked whether CAMKII phosphorylates FOXO3 in vitro. Purified GST fusion proteins containing five non-overlapping fragments of FOXO3 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lehtinen et al., 2006</a>) were incubated with an active recombinant human CAMKIIA. CAMKIIA robustly phosphorylated the P2 and P3 fragments but not the others (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>), placing the phosphorylation sites within aa 154\u2013409. Mass spectrometry and mutagenesis studies of the full-length mFOXO3 or the P2 and P3 fragments from the in vitro kinase assay mapped the CAMKIIA phosphorylation sites to S252, S279, and S298 (not shown). The same sites were also identified from FLAG-mFOXO3 co-expressed with CAMKIIA in HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, only mFOXO3 S298, which corresponds to DAF-16 S286, had a significant increase in phosphorylation when cells were co-transfected with CAMKIIA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). This shows that S298 is the principle CAMKIIA phosphorylation site in vivo. S252 in mouse FOXO3 or S253 in human FOXO3, the counterpart of DAF-16 T240 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), is a highly conserved AKT phosphorylation site (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brunet et al., 1999</a>). Using a specific antibody, we found that neither CAMKIIA nor Calcineurin regulated phosphorylation of endogenous human FOXO3 at S253 in HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, Calcineurin can reduce the phosphorylation of the FOXO3-P3 fragment (containing S298) by CAMKIIA, but not that of the P2 fragment (containing S252) (<a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that mammalian CAMKII and Calcineurin regulate phosphorylation of FOXO3 at the same conserved site as in <i>C. elegans</i> (S298 in mouse FOXO3 and S286 in DAF-16)."

Serine 300 of mouse FOXO1, the equivalent of S298 of mouse FOXO3, is not among them (S246, S295, S467, and S475). To find out whether the CAMKIIA isoform phosphorylates FOXO1 in the same way as it does FOXO3, we expressed a FLAG-tagged human FOXO1 in HEK293T cells co-transfected or not with CAMKIIA. Mass spectrometry analysis identified three CAMKIIA-regulated phosphorylation sites equivalent to mouse FOXO1 S295, S467, and S475 (not shown). This agrees with the findings by Ozcan et al. and suggests that CAMKII directly phosphorylates FOXO3 but not FOXO1 in mammals."

Mutation of this residue to A or D results in a kinase dead or constitutively active form of CAMKII, respectively (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fong et al., 1989</a>). Using a luciferase reporter assay, we found that the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 was indeed stimulated by CAMKIIA in a way that required S298 of FOXO3 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>) and T286 of CAMKIIA (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>), and further enhanced by the constitutively active CAMKIIA mutant (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). Consistently, expression of Calcineurin significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). From these results, we conclude that CAMKIIA and Calcineurin oppose each other in regulating the transcriptional activity of mouse FOXO3 through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation at S298.

The direct, antagonistic nature of these two enzymes also raised an interesting possibility that, with their opposing effects on DAF-16 and a common activating signal (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAM), UNC-43 and TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 would constitutively negate each other and have essentially no control of DAF-16. However, this outcome most likely does not occur because of the difference in the spatial distribution and temporal activation profiles of the two enzymes. TAX-6 and CNB-1, similar to DAF-16, are expressed in most cells in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ogg et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kuhara et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dong et al., 2007</a>).

In contrast, the CFP::UNC-43 fusion protein is concentrated on perinuclear structures and clusters in neurites (<a href=\"#bib47\">Umemura et al., 2005</a>). Temporally, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated CAMKII phosphorylates another molecule of CAMKII at T286 to convert it to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAM-independent kinase, prolonging the kinase activity after the initial activation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Erickson et al., 2011</a>). CAMKII can also be activated by ROS at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Erickson et al., 2011</a>). In mammalian cells, inhibition of Calcineurin by cytoplasmic CAMKII and inhibition of CAMKII by Calcineurin have both been reported (<a href=\"#bib33\">MacDonnell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kubokawa et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that the balance is intricately maintained. Therefore, in the case of the simultaneous activation of CAMKII and Calcineurin by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAM, either the kinase or the phosphatase could dominate the regulation of DAF-16 either locally (e.g., cytoplasm vs nucleus) or for certain time windows. This balance likely fine-tunes the DAF-16 activity in response to a changing environment."

The data strongly support the authors\u2019 hypothesis that <i>daf-16</i> function is positively regulated by phosphorylation by the latter and negatively regulated by dephosphorylation of the former. Furthermore, stress responses appear to be mediated by this system in controlling life span in worms. However, recent data published by Ozcan et al (cited in the present paper but not discussed in sufficient detail) have revealed phosphorylation of FOXO by CamKII, nuclear translocation, and phospho sites that are distinct from AKT sites, so these findings are not completely novel. Nonetheless, this paper extends our information substantially and the impact would be even further strengthened with extension of the findings into a mammalian system.

However, DAF-16(T240A) accumulated in the nucleus, even in an essentially WT background. This is consistent with T240 being an AKT phosphorylation site, not an UNC-43 phosphorylation site. The phenotype of DAF-16(T240A-S286A) is complex, but mostly mimicking a strong loss-of-AKT phenotype. This result again agrees with T240 being an AKT phosphorylation site and echoes with the other data shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, suggesting that insulin signaling overpowers UNC-43 signaling when in conflict. Lastly, DAF-16(T240A) has no effect on lifespan (below in Author response image 1), resembling DAF-16(4AM), in which four AKT consensus phosphorylation sites are all mutated to alanine (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lin et al., 2001</a> Nat.
