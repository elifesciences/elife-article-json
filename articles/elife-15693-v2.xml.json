We investigated how nutritional states modulated starvation-induced hyperactivity in adult <i>Drosophila</i>. The receptor of the adipokinetic hormone (AKHR), the insect analog of glucagon, was required for starvation-induced hyperactivity. AKHR was expressed in a small group of octopaminergic neurons in the brain. Silencing AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons and blocking octopamine signaling in these neurons eliminated starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activation of these neurons accelerated the onset of hyperactivity upon starvation. Neither AKHR nor AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons were involved in increased food consumption upon starvation, suggesting that starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are independently regulated. Single cell analysis of AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons identified the co-expression of <i>Drosophila</i> insulin-like receptor (dInR), which imposed suppressive effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity. Therefore, insulin and glucagon signaling exert opposite effects on starvation-induced hyperactivity via a common neural target in <i>Drosophila</i>."

We investigated how nutritional states modulated starvation-induced hyperactivity in adult <i>Drosophila</i>. The receptor of the adipokinetic hormone (AKHR), the insect analog of glucagon, was required for starvation-induced hyperactivity. AKHR was expressed in a small group of octopaminergic neurons in the brain. Silencing AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons and blocking octopamine signaling in these neurons eliminated starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activation of these neurons accelerated the onset of hyperactivity upon starvation. Neither AKHR nor AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons were involved in increased food consumption upon starvation, suggesting that starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are independently regulated. Single cell analysis of AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons identified the co-expression of <i>Drosophila</i> insulin-like receptor (dInR), which imposed suppressive effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity. Therefore, insulin and glucagon signaling exert opposite effects on starvation-induced hyperactivity via a common neural target in <i>Drosophila</i>."

In humans, glucagon is released when blood sugar levels are low and stimulates hunger, while insulin is released when blood sugar is high and acts to suppress feelings of hunger. Therefore, food seeking in the flies is under the precise control of signals of hunger and satiety."

Energy deprivation drives a complex behavioral program to ensure adequate food intake (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sternson et al., 2013</a>). As an adaptive response to starvation, food intake is modulated by nutrient and hormonal cues. In mammals, the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, especially the neurons expressing agouti-related protein (AgRP)/neuropeptide Y (NPY), and those expressing pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), sense and integrate numerous nutritional cues such as circulating glucose, insulin, leptin, and ghrelin and modulate food intake in response (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belgardt et al., 2009</a>). In fruit flies, several hormonal signals modulate different aspects of food intake, these including <i>Drosophila</i> insulin-like peptides (DILPs), the two homologs of mammalian NPY, neuropeptide F (NPF) and short neuropeptide F (sNPF), and a handful of other neuropeptides such as allatostatin A (AstA), leucokinin, and hugin (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pool and Scott, 2014</a>).

Starvation enhances food-seeking behavior in two parallel ways. On the one hand, starvation modulates the perception of food associated sensory cues, increasing the likelihood to target desirable food sources. In fruit flies, starvation increases the sensitivity of Or42b<sup>+</sup> olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that mediate odor attraction, and decreases the sensitivity of aversive Or85a<sup>+</sup> ORNs, resulting in enhanced behavioral attraction to food odors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ko et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Root et al., 2011</a>).

However, AKH has a role in modulating lipid storage as well as starvation resistance and whether it imposes a direct effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity remains unclear (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bharucha et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gr\u00f6nke et al., 2007</a>).

It is of great interest to understand how these two behaviors are dynamically regulated by the nutritional states and the availability of food sources.

To do so, we expressed NaChBac (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nitabach et al., 2006</a>), a bacterial sodium channel, in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons. NaChBac expression increases the membrane excitability and facilitates the activation of these neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nitabach et al., 2006</a>). We found that NaChBac expression in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons accelerated the onset of hyperactivity upon starvation. While the two control lines only exhibited a\u00a0significant increase in locomotion during Day two of the assay, NaChBac expression in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons led to increased locomotor activity from Day one of the assay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013d</a>).

We hypothesized that besides AKH, AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons might also sense other hormonal cues that exerted modulatory effects on the activity of AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons and hence starvation-induced hyperactivity. To examine this hypothesis, we labeled AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons with mCD8GFP, extracted individual GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons (and randomly picked GFP<sup>-</sup> neurons as negative controls) from fly brains, and performed single-cell RT-PCR analysis. All GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons we examined were AKHR positive, confirming that the nSyb:AD/AKHR:BD-GAL4 driver reliably recapitulates the endogenous expression pattern of AKHR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a\u2013b</a>, 'GFP' and 'AKHR'). We also performed single-cell RNA-seq using the cells labeled by the nSyb:AD/AKHR:BD-GAL4 driver. Consistent with our single-cell RT-PCR experiments, all GFP<sup>+</sup> cells we examined by RNA-seq showed considerable AKHR expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>, 'AKHR').

Starvation influences food-seeking behavior via both modulating the perception of food cues as well as enhancing flies\u2019 locomotor activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7i</a>). Accumulated evidence has suggested that starvation modulates the activity of ORNs via multiple neural and hormonal cues (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beshel and Zhong, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ko et al., 2015</a>), which in turn facilitates odor-driven food search (<a href=\"#bib41\">Root et al., 2011</a>) and food consumption (<a href=\"#bib15\">Farhadian et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, starvation also modulates the perception of food taste via the relative sensitivity of appetitive sweet-sensing and aversive bitter-sensing GRNs, which may in turn increase the attractiveness of food taste (<a href=\"#bib22\">Inagaki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Inagaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Marella et al., 2012</a>).

In the present study, we have shown that a small group of neurons located in the SEZ region of the fly brain are both necessary and sufficient for starvation-induced hyperactivity.

Single cell analysis has identified that these AKHR<sup>+</sup>dInR<sup>+</sup> neurons are octopaminergic, which offers an entry point to trace the downstream neural circuitry that regulates starvation-induced hyperactivity. For example, there are 7 candidate octopamine receptors in fruit flies and it would be of interest to investigate whether any of these receptors and the receptor-expressing neurons are involved in locomotor regulation upon starvation (<a href=\"#bib14\">El-Kholy et al., 2015</a>)."

As its mammalian analog glucagon, the reduction in circulating sugars induces the release of AKH, which in turn mobilizes fat storage and provides energy supply for flies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bharucha et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim and Rulifson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee and Park, 2004</a>). In contrast, DILPs, the insect analog of mammalian insulin, function as satiety hormones. Dietary nutrient induces the release of DILPs into the hemolymph, which in turn promotes protein synthesis, body growth, and other anabolic processes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buch et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rulifson et al., 2002</a>). We have shown that these two hormonal signaling systems exert opposite effects on starvation-induced hyperactivity via a small group of AKHR<sup>+</sup>InR<sup>+</sup> octopaminergic neurons. These results suggest that these AKHR<sup>+</sup>dInR<sup>+</sup> neurons can integrate the inputs from the two hormonal signaling systems representing hunger and satiety at the same time, and modulate flies\u2019 locomotor activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7i</a>). This elegant yet concise design allows these neurons to be responsive to rapid changes in the internal nutritional states as well as food availability. Furthermore, it is possible that besides hunger and satiety, other physiological states such as wakefulness, stress, and emotions also influence flies\u2019 locomotor activity. Notably, our single cell analysis has shown that these AKHR<sup>+</sup>dInR<sup>+</sup> neurons also sparsely express other neuropeptide receptors, suggesting that at least small portions of these neurons may also receive input from other neuropeptidergic systems."

But whether these two behaviors are interdependently or independently regulated remains unclear. In this present study, we have shown that these two behaviors are dissociable from each other in fruit flies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7i</a>). On the one hand, although AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons exert a\u00a0robust modulatory effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity, these neurons are neither necessary nor sufficient for starvation-induced food consumption (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). On the other hand, the regulation of food consumption is independent of starvation-induced hyperactivity as well. We have previously shown that a small subset of GABAergic neurons in the fly brain regulates food consumption but exerts no effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pool et al., 2014</a>). In addition, several neuropeptides are known to regulate food consumption, such as Hugin, NPF, sNPF, Leucokinin, and AstA (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Anzi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hergarden et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Melcher and Pankratz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wu et al., 2005</a>). However, we found in our RNAi screen that the receptors of these neuropeptides were not involved in the regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Taken together, it is likely that starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are independently regulated by different sets of hormonal cues, and that AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons are only involved in the former but not the latter. Our results may shed light on the regulation of food intake in mammals, especially whether starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are also independently regulated by different sets of hormones and distinct neural circuitry in mammals."

They use a quasi-unbiased transgenic RNAi screen to test which of some 31 neuropeptide receptors are required in the nervous system for starvation-induced hyperactivity. Of these they identify one AKHR that has the strongest effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity (though others appear to have significant effects as well). This is significant because AKHR is the receptor for insect glucagon, which is released under starvation conditions. The AKH receptor is expressed in a small number of identified central neurons as well as in sugar sensing labellar neurons: however, it does not appear to be required for starvation induced locomotion in peripheral receptors."
