Brassinosteroids play important roles in regulating root hair specification by unknown mechanisms. Here, we systematically examined root hair phenotypes in brassinosteroid-related mutants, and found that brassinosteroid signaling inhibits root hair formation through GSK3-like kinases or upstream components. We found that with enhanced brassinosteroid signaling, <i>GL2</i>, a cell fate marker for non-hair cells, is ectopically expressed in hair cells, while its expression in non-hair cells is suppressed when brassinosteroid signaling is reduced. Genetic analysis demonstrated that brassinosteroid-regulated root epidermal cell patterning is dependent on the WER-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 transcriptional complex. One of the GSK3-like kinases, BIN2, interacted with and phosphorylated EGL3, and EGL3s mutated at phosphorylation sites were retained in hair cell nuclei. BIN2 phosphorylated TTG1 to inhibit the activity of the WER-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 complex. Thus, our study provides insights into the mechanism of brassinosteroid regulation of root hair patterning."

Brassinosteroids play important roles in regulating root hair specification by unknown mechanisms. Here, we systematically examined root hair phenotypes in brassinosteroid-related mutants, and found that brassinosteroid signaling inhibits root hair formation through GSK3-like kinases or upstream components. We found that with enhanced brassinosteroid signaling, <i>GL2</i>, a cell fate marker for non-hair cells, is ectopically expressed in hair cells, while its expression in non-hair cells is suppressed when brassinosteroid signaling is reduced. Genetic analysis demonstrated that brassinosteroid-regulated root epidermal cell patterning is dependent on the WER-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 transcriptional complex. One of the GSK3-like kinases, BIN2, interacted with and phosphorylated EGL3, and EGL3s mutated at phosphorylation sites were retained in hair cell nuclei. BIN2 phosphorylated TTG1 to inhibit the activity of the WER-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 complex. Thus, our study provides insights into the mechanism of brassinosteroid regulation of root hair patterning."

Thus, root hairs are where most water and mineral nutrients are absorbed. Many factors affect whether, or not, a plant cell will develop into a root hair.

Hair (H) cells, or trichoblasts, are specified early from root epidermal cells that lie over clefts between two underlying cortical cells, whereas the root epidermal cells that lie over a single cortical cell develop as non-hair (N) cells, or atrichoblasts (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ishida et al., 2008</a>). Hair cell and non-hair cell files are patterned alternately in rows within the <i>Arabidopsis</i> root epidermis, with columns of hair cells interspersed with columns of non-hair cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schiefelbein et al., 2009</a>). Prior to root hair outgrowth, root epidermal cells in the H position can be distinguished from those in the N position by many visible cellular features, including a greater rate of cell division (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berger et al., 1998</a>), reduced cell length and vacuolation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dolan et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Galway et al., 1994</a>), and enhanced cytoplasmic density (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dolan et al., 1994</a>). It is proposed that positional signals and a putative receptor-like kinase SCRAMBLED (SCM) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kwak et al., 2005</a>) function through a MYB-bHLH-WD40 repeat transcriptional complex to determine root epidermal cell fate (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schiefelbein et al., 2009</a>). Based on this model, in N cells, WEREWOLF (WER) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee and Schiefelbein, 1999</a>), a R2R3 MYB-domain transcription factor, forms a complex with basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, GLABRA3 (GL3)/ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernhardt et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>), and a WD40 repeat protein, TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Galway et al., 1994</a>), to promote expression of <i>GLABRA2</i> (<i>GL2</i>) and <i>CAPRICE</i> (<i>CPC</i>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ryu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Song et al., 2011</a>). GL2, a homeodomain/leucine zipper transcription factor, negatively regulates H cell fate and positively regulates N cell fate (<a href=\"#bib28\">Masucci et al., 1996</a>). CPC (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wada et al., 1997</a>), a MYB-type transcription factor, moves from N cells to H cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kurata et al., 2005a</a>) to compete with WER for binding to GL3/EGL3 to form a CPC-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 complex, which is unable to induce <i>GL2</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib40\">Song et al., 2011</a>). In addition to CPC, the bHLH transcription factor GL3 is also a mobile protein (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bernhardt et al., 2005</a>). <i>GL3</i> and its homologue <i>EGL3</i> are both expressed in H cells, but GL3 protein is only localized in the N cell nucleus, indicating that GL3 protein moves into the adjoining N cell nucleus to determine N cell fate (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernhardt et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2005</a>). Integration of existing genetic and biochemical data also supports an alternative mechanism centered on the movement of transcriptional factors between epidermal cells rather than a putative local activation of the <i>WER</i> gene function to determine root epidermis pattern formation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Savage et al., 2008</a>)."

Moreover, jasmonic acids (JAs) promote root hair formation through their interaction with ethylene (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhu et al., 2006</a>). However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of how these internal hormones integrate with environmental cues to regulate root hair cell fate determination are still poorly understood."

BRs are perceived by the receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li and Chory, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hothorn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">She et al., 2011</a>). The BR-activated BRI1 phosphorylates BRI1 KINASE INHIBITOR 1 (BKI1) to release its inhibition (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wang and Chory, 2006</a>), and then BKI1 acts as a positive regulator by binding to a subset of 14-3-3 proteins (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Another BRI1 substrate, BR-SIGNALING KINASE (BSK), transduces the BR signaling through <i>bri1</i> SUPPRESSORS 1 (BSU1) to inactivate a GSK3-like kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2), which leads to accumulation of the dephosphorylated form of transcriptional factors BRI1 EMS SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1)/BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) in the nucleus to regulate gene expression (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yang et al., 2011</a>). A previous study suggests that BRs play an important role in determining root epidermal cell fate by regulating <i>WER</i> and <i>GL2</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kuppusamy et al., 2009</a>). However, the elaborate molecular mechanism by which BRs regulate root epidermal cell fate and development is still unknown."

We found that BRs regulate root epidermal cell fate through promoting <i>GL2</i> expression in both H and N cells, which is mediated by GSK3-like kinases and the WER-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 complex as indicated by genetic analysis and biochemical studies. Our study further demonstrated that BIN2, one of the GSK3-like kinases, interacted with and phosphorylated EGL3 on T399 and T209/T213, leading to its trafficking from nucleus to cytosol in H cells, which may facilitate its movement from H cells to N cells. BIN2 also phosphorylated TTG1 to inhibit the activity of the WER-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 transcriptional complex. These results explain how BR signaling regulates both the formation and activity of the WER-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 complex through GSK3-like kinases to coordinate root epidermal cell fate specification."

We found that the relative hair number (=root hair density \u00d7 root hair cell length) was higher in <i>bri1-116</i> (4.67 \u00b1 0.47), <i>det2-1</i> (4.75 \u00b1 0.52), and <i>cpd</i> (4.65 \u00b1 0.54), and significantly lower in <i>BRI1-OX</i> (3.40 \u00b1 0.46) and <i>bin2-3 bil1 bil2</i> (2.86 \u00b1 0.39) than in their corresponding wild types Col-0 (3.89 \u00b1 0.43) and WS-2 (3.85 \u00b1 0.41) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). However, there was no significant difference between <i>BES1-RNAi</i> and Col-0. Images at the highest magnification (\u00d7100; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) showed that in the wild type root (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), the H cells and N cells were arranged in alternating files with the H cell columns regularly interspaced with the N cell columns; no adjacent H cell columns were found. However, in the BR signaling-inhibited mutants, including <i>bri1-116</i>, <i>det2-1</i>, and <i>cpd</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>), many root hair columns were next to each other, leading to more root hairs, suggesting that some N cell fate might be changed into H cell fate. In contrast, the BR signaling-enhanced plants, including <i>BRI1-OX</i> and <i>bin2-3 bil1 bil2</i>, grew fewer root hairs than the wild type, due to the fact that they lacked root hairs in many H cell positions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,E\u2013G</a>).

We found that compared with plants grown on the mock medium (3.80 \u00b1 0.45), the relative root hair number of plants grown on medium containing 100 nM eBL (3.22 \u00b1 0.42) or 30 \u03bcM bikinin (2.71 \u00b1 0.50) was significantly reduced, while it was greatly increased in plants grown on medium containing 1 \u03bcM Brz (4.17 \u00b1 0.43) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>).

In order to test whether the disordered root hair patterning in the BR-related mutants resulted from an altered root epidermal cell fate, we analyzed the <i>GL2</i> expression pattern in these mutants using <i>PGL2::GUS</i> as a reporter. We found that in the wild type, 1.3% of epidermal cells in the N position lacked <i>GL2</i> expression in cross-sections (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), and in the longitudinal view of root epidermis, the root epidermal cell files were arranged regularly, with <i>GL2</i>-expressing columns (N cell columns) interspaced with columns without <i>GL2</i> expression (H cell columns) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, about 15.3% of <i>bri1-116</i> and 18.8% of <i>det2-1</i> cells showed suppressed <i>PGL2::GUS</i> expression, and there were adjacent root epidermal cells without <i>GL2</i> expression in both <i>bri1-116</i> and <i>det2-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013I</a>), which supports a previous finding with <i>bri1-116</i> and the Brz-treated wild type (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kuppusamy et al., 2009</a>). These results indicated that adjacent root hairs in <i>bri1-116</i> and <i>det2-1</i> were caused by some N cell fate changing to H cell fate. In contrast, <i>GL2</i> was ectopically expressed in about 13.5% of H cells in <i>BRI1-OX</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J\u2013L</a>) and in about 19.6% in <i>bin2-3 bil1 bil2</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2M\u2013O</a>), as compared with only 3.2% in the wild type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>), indicating that lack of <i>GL2</i> expression in N cells may correspond to the ectopic root hairs observed in <i>bri1-116</i> and <i>det2-1</i>, and that the ectopically expressed <i>GL2</i> in H cells partially inhibits H cell fate in <i>BRI1-OX</i> and <i>bin2-3 bil1 bil2</i> plants. Taken together, the above results suggested that BR signaling has an important role in suppressing H cell fate and promoting N cell fate in both the N and the H positions, and BR signaling regulates root epidermal cell fate by controlling <i>GL2</i> expression through GSK3-like kinases, or their upstream components, but not through downstream transcription factors."

We then conducted yeast two-hybrid assays to test whether any components in the WER-EGL3/GL3-TTG1 or CPC-EGL3/GL3-TTG1 complex interact with BIN2, a well-studied GSK3-like kinase, and found that BIN2 can interact with EGL3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) but not with CPC in yeast (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

                                "text": "To investigate the biological relevance of EGL3 phosphorylation by a GSK3-like kinase BIN2, we used mass spectrometry and identified four potential phosphorylation sites (T209, T213, T399, and T403) of EGL3 by BIN2 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which are located in two regions that contain typical recognition sites of GSK3 kinases (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cohen and Frame, 2001</a>). We then mutated threonine residues into alanine to make single- or double-site mutated forms of EGL3. In vitro phosphorylation assays showed that phosphorylation levels of EGL3<sup>T399A</sup> and EGL3<sup>T209A/T213A</sup> by BIN2 were significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), indicating that T399 and T209/T213 are the main phosphorylated residues. To investigate the biological function of EGL3 phosphorylation, we transformed <i>EGL3</i> and its mutated forms driven by its own promoter into Col-0 to examine their subcellular localization. We found that the EGL3-GFP signal in N cells was apparently higher than that in H cells, and that it was mainly localized to cytosol in H cells, but to both cytosol and nucleus in N cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). As <i>EGL3</i> mRNA is only expressed in H cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bernhardt et al., 2005</a>), this result indicated that, like its homologue GL3, EGL3 is also a mobile protein that moves from H cells to N cells. However, the EGL3<sup>T399A</sup>-GFP and EGL3<sup>T209A/T213A</sup>-GFP were solely localized to the nuclei of H cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), indicating that EGL3 phosphorylation is required not only for its cytoplasmic accumulation, but also for its movement from H cells to N cells. In addition, we found that the root hair patterning of <i>EGL3-GFP</i> transgenic plants was not altered (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), indicating that correctly localized EGL3, mainly in N cell nuclei to promote N cell fate and less in H cell nuclei not to promote N cell fate, has no influence on root epidermal fate. Moreover, although root epidermal patterning in the <i>EGL3</i><sup><i>T399A</i></sup><i>-GFP</i> transgenic plants was normal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), the number of root hairs in <i>EGL3</i><sup><i>T209A/T213A</i></sup><i>-GFP</i> plants was significantly reduced, likely due to a misspecification of non-hair cells in the H position (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), suggesting that the nucleus-localized EGL3 in H cells may determine N cell fate specification. Taken together, our results indicate that BIN2 phosphorylation on T399, T209, and/or T213 of EGL3 in H cells promotes EGL3 cytoplasmic localization, which likely helps its movement from H to N cells to regulate root epidermal cell fate."

Transgenic <i>TTG1-GFP</i> plants driven by its own promoter indicated that TTG1 was preferentially localized in the cytoplasm and slightly in the nucleus of both N and H cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which was consistent with the subcellular localization of its petunia homologue AN11 (<a href=\"#bib7\">De Vetten et al., 1997</a>). To understand the biological relevance of TTG1 phosphorylation by a GSK3-like kinase, we conducted transient transcription assays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves to examine whether BIN2 regulated the complex's activity in a TTG1-dependent manner. We constructed a dual-luciferase reporter system using <i>PGL2::LUC</i> as a reporter gene and <i>35S::REN</i> as an internal control (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Because the protein of the gain-of-function mutation bin2-1 (E263K) is more stable and has higher activity than the wild type BIN2 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Peng et al., 2008</a>), and GSK3-like kinases are quite conserved among different species (<a href=\"#bib33\">Saidi et al., 2012</a>), we used bin2-1 to conduct this study. As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, transient expression of <i>WER</i> alone was able to slightly induce <i>PGL2::LUC</i> gene expression. In contrast, transient expression of <i>EGL3</i> alone was unable to induce reporter gene expression. Co-expression of <i>WER</i> and <i>EGL3</i> can dramatically promote <i>LUC</i> expression, which is consistent with a previous study (<a href=\"#bib40\">Song et al., 2011</a>). Additional bin2-1 did not alter the effect of WER, EGL3, or both WER and EGL3 on <i>PGL2::LUC</i> expression. When WER, EGL3, and TTG1 were used together, the expression of <i>PGL2::LUC</i> was further enhanced, indicating that TTG1 can promote the activity of the WER-EGL3 complex. Interestingly, additional bin2-1 significantly inhibited reporter gene expression regulated by the WER-EGL3-TTG1 complex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), indicating that TTG1 is mediating the negative effect of BIN2 on this transcriptional complex."

First, root hair patterning in the BR-biosynthetic and responsive mutants or in the wild type grown on eBL, bikinin, or BRZ, was dramatically altered, demonstrating that GSK3 kinases and/or their upstream components are mediating this regulation. Second, the expression pattern of the non-hair cell fate marker <i>PGL2::GUS</i> indicates that BR early signaling promotes N cell fate in the whole root epidermis, which is a reasonable explanation for the abnormal root hair patterning in the BR-related mutants: when BR signaling is enhanced, fewer root hairs are formed in the H position; when BR signaling is inhibited, more ectopic root hairs are produced in the N position. This finding supports the previous report that BRs positively regulate the expression of <i>WER</i> and <i>GL2</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kuppusamy et al., 2009</a>). Third, genetic analysis revealed that major components of the WER-EGL3-TTG1 or CPC-EGL3-TTG1 complex act downstream of BR signaling-mediated root epidermis patterning. Finally, BIN2 phosphorylation on EGL3 and TTG1 suggested that GSK3-like kinases directly regulate EGL3 movement and the transcription activity of the WER-EGL3-TTG1 complex to mediate root hair development."

                                "text": "This study revealed a key mechanism in the regulation of intercellular communication of transcription factors by a hormonal signal to determine epidermal cell specification. Non-cell autonomous movement of some transcriptional factors is an important mechanism to regulate some developmental processes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kurata et al., 2005b</a>), and cytoplasmic localization of these mobile proteins may be required for their intercellular movement. For example, in maize shoot apical meristem, a mutation in its potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) of KNOTTED 1 abolished its intercellular movement (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vollbrecht et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lucas et al., 1995</a>), and cytoplasmic localization of LEAFY (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schultz and Haughn, 1991</a>), a transcriptional factor in floral identity, is also strongly correlated with its adjacent cell movement (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wu et al., 2003</a>). Moreover, the movement of SHORT-ROOT, another mobile transcriptional factor in root radical patterning (<a href=\"#bib14\">Helariutta et al., 2000</a>), was abolished when it was fused to a NLS, leading to its diminished cytoplasmic localization (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gallagher et al., 2004</a>). However, it is largely unknown how the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of transcription factors is regulated by internal cues to influence their intercellular movement. Although the intercellular movement of mobile factors in the WER/CPC-EGL3/GL3-TTG1 complex may determine root epidermis patterning (<a href=\"#bib34\">Savage et al., 2008</a>), it is not clear how their movement is regulated by internal cues. Because <i>EGL3</i> mRNA was expressed only in H cells, the major nuclear localization of EGL3 protein in N cells indicated that, like GL3 and CPC, EGL3 can also move from H to N cells. In addition, we found that EGL3<sup>T399A</sup> and EGL3<sup>T209A/T213A</sup> with abolished phosphorylation sites were solely localized in the nucleus of H cells, indicating that the unphosphorylated EGL3 may not move between cells. Although we do not know how T209/T213 phosphorylation regulated EGL3 subcellular localization, the T399 phosphorylation likely affected a NLS, because T399 is located in a predicted non-canonical NLS (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>), which is found in many other plant bHLHs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Galstyan et al., 2012</a>). Although the <i>EGL3</i><sup><i>T399A</i></sup><i>-GFP</i> plants showed normal root hair patterning, this can be explained by the close proximity of T399 to its bHLH domain, which may have affected its interaction with TTG1 and MYB (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>), leading to the nucleus-localized EGL3<sup>T399A</sup> in H cells unable to induce <i>GL2</i> expression. However, EGL3<sup>T209A/T213A</sup>-GFP may still interact with TTG1 and have DNA-binding activity, because T209/T213 was located in the N-terminal region far away from the bHLH domain (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which led to <i>GL2</i> expression in H cells and <i>EGL3</i><sup><i>T209A/T213A</i></sup><i>-GFP</i> plants growing fewer root hairs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

In <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> pavement cells, it was demonstrated that BIN2 has a negative role in WER-EGL3-TTG1 transcriptional activity, but has no effect on the activity of WER, EGL3, or both WER and EGL3. Although BIN2 phosphorylates EGL3, its failure to regulate WER-EGL3 transcriptional activity can be explained by a possible ubiquitous expression of <i>WER</i>, <i>EGL3</i>, and GSK3-like kinases in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves. Furthermore, it was reported that TTG1 interacts with EGL3 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>), and TTG1 is necessary for the full functioning of other bHLH partners, such as GL3 and TRANSPARENT TESTA8 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baudry et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>).

Second, in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, both <i>EGL3</i> and <i>GL3</i> are expressed in H cells, but their proteins move to adjacent cells to promote N cell fate (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bernhardt et al., 2005</a>). If they stay in H cells with the ability to interact with WER and TTG1, the H cells may develop into N cells as shown in the <i>EGL3</i><sup><i>T209A/T213A</i></sup><i>-GFP</i> transgenic plants. Moreover, over-expression of <i>GL3</i> and <i>EGL3</i> promoted non-hair cell fate (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernhardt et al., 2003</a>). Third, TTG1 is localized in both N and H cells, and TTG1 and EGL3 may synergistically promote WER-EGL3 transcriptional activity and enhance N cell fate. Apparently, BR signaling can promote N cell fate in several ways. Besides the inhibition of BR signaling on EGL3 cell\u2013cell movement and the promotion of TTG1 activity, BR signaling also promotes <i>WER</i> expression as <i>WER</i> up-regulation in <i>bin2-3 bil1 bil2</i> (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which is consistent with the positive role of BRs in <i>WER</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kuppusamy et al., 2009</a>)."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, without BRs, WER-GL3/EGl3-TTG1 complex formation and activity is inhibited in both N and H cells, as <i>WER</i> expression is reduced in both H and N cells, and the activated GSK3-like kinases phosphorylate EGL3 in H cells to promote its cytoplasmic localization in both H cells and N cells, both of which lead to less WER-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 complex formation in nuclei and suppression of <i>GL2</i> expression. The activity of some formed WER-bHLH-TTG1 complexes may be further inhibited by GSK3-like kinases phosphorylating TTG1. In contrast, enhanced BR early signaling inhibits GSK3-like kinases, leading to nuclear accumulation of the unphosphorylated EGL3 in H cells and normal function of unphosphorylated TTG1 in both cell types. Although CPC can move into H cells, due to enhanced <i>WER</i> expression and more efficient interaction of EGL3 with WER than with CPC (<a href=\"#bib40\">Song et al., 2011</a>), more WER-EGL3-TTG1 complex is formed in H cells to promote <i>GL2</i> expression and determine N cell fate. In N cells, the nucleus-localized GL3 can interact with WER and TTG1 to promote <i>GL2</i> expression and maintain N cell fate. However, it remains to be investigated how <i>TTG1</i> and <i>WER</i> expression is regulated by BR signaling. It is also not clear how BR signaling coordinates with positional signals and other phytohormones to regulate root hair patterning."

While the first evidence for BR involvement in root hair patterning was published by <a href=\"#bib20\">Kuppusamy et al. (2009)</a>, this paper goes significantly beyond this early work, to include a broad array of experiments (including more BR-biosynthetic and signaling mutants, greater variety of BR inhibitors, and analysis of more epidermal patterning genes) and, most importantly, providing a clear mechanistic explanation (including evidence that the non-hair BR effect is mediated by GSK3-like kinases and evidence for interaction/phosphorylation of EGL3 and TTG1 by BIN2). Particularly exciting is that the work reveals an example of a core BR-signaling component targeting a non-BR transcription factor."
