Protein binders such as nanobodies (Nbs) can target untagged proteins (antigens) in the intracellular environment. However, genetically expressed protein binders are stable regardless of antigen expression, complicating their use for applications that require cell-specificity. Here, we created a conditional system in which the stability of an Nb depends upon an antigen of interest. We identified Nb framework mutations that can be used to rapidly create destabilized Nbs. Fusion of destabilized Nbs to various proteins enabled applications in living cells, such as optogenetic control of neural activity in specific cell types in the mouse brain, and detection of HIV-infected human cells by flow cytometry. These approaches are generalizable to other protein binders, and enable the rapid generation of single-polypeptide sensors and effectors active in cells expressing specific intracellular epitopes."

Protein binders such as nanobodies (Nbs) can target untagged proteins (antigens) in the intracellular environment. However, genetically expressed protein binders are stable regardless of antigen expression, complicating their use for applications that require cell-specificity. Here, we created a conditional system in which the stability of an Nb depends upon an antigen of interest. We identified Nb framework mutations that can be used to rapidly create destabilized Nbs. Fusion of destabilized Nbs to various proteins enabled applications in living cells, such as optogenetic control of neural activity in specific cell types in the mouse brain, and detection of HIV-infected human cells by flow cytometry. These approaches are generalizable to other protein binders, and enable the rapid generation of single-polypeptide sensors and effectors active in cells expressing specific intracellular epitopes."

Any protein that is tethered to the engineered nanobody is also broken down. For example, some tethered proteins with useful biological activities are fluorescent proteins and enzymes that can modify DNA. When one of these engineered nanobodies binds to a protein target of interest, the activity of the nanobody-tethered protein can be turned on in just those cells that produce the targeted protein. Thus, this strategy of engineering allows \u201cconditionally stable\u201d tools to be generated."

Another application of the technique enables live human cells that have been infected with HIV to be detected and isolated."

Although this can be achieved by exploiting transcriptional elements that are selectively active in a subset of cells, specific elements are often not available, and can be difficult to generate. Alternatively, other features that distinguish cells, such as expression of a specific RNA or protein, may be exploited. Recently, it has become possible to utilize specific intracellular proteins to drive desired molecular events, using RNA-based binders in cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Auslander et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Culler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kennedy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Saito et al., 2011</a>), and protein-based binders in cells and animals (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tang et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2015</a>). While current methods are promising, protein-responsive systems are continually evolving. There remains a need for generalizable strategies that enable rapid conversion of diverse classes of binders into protein-responsive tools."

Nbs, the antigen recognition portions of single chain antibodies found in camelids (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993</a>) and cartilaginous fishes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Greenberg et al., 1995</a>), bind their cognate antigens with high affinity and specificity, and have the added advantage over heterotetrameric antibodies in that they are very stable in the intracellular environment. Fusions between Nbs and proteins with desirable activities have enabled a number of applications in living cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Caussinus et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Irannejad et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kirchhofer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rothbauer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tang et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2015</a>). Despite these successes, it has been difficult to take advantage of Nbs for live cell applications requiring cell-specificity, as genetically expressed Nb-fusion proteins are stable and active even in cells that do not express the cognate antigens. This is a general problem that applies to any class of protein-based binder. To address this issue, we reasoned that the Nb portion of a single Nb-fusion protein could be modified to be conditionally stable in living cells, with stability conferred by the presence of antigen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). A similar approach has been used to create small molecule-dependent domains, for temporal control or tuning of protein activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Banaszynski et al., 2006</a>)."

We used these reagents to optogenetically control neural activities in specific cell types, as well as detect and isolate Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected cells based upon the expression of the HIV-1 capsid protein.

                                "text": "To test whether it is possible to modify an Nb such that its intracellular protein level is strongly dependent upon antigen co-expression, we used the GFP-binding Nb, GBP1, for proof-of-concept experiments (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kirchhofer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rothbauer et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). We generated a Moloney\u00a0murine leukemia virus (MMLV) library encoding randomly mutagenized variants of GBP1 fused to the blue fluorescent protein, TagBFP (<a href=\"#bib48\">Subach et al., 2008</a>). t-HcRed (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gurskaya et al., 2001</a>) was co-expressed via an IRES to report infection. TagBFP and t-HcRed bear little amino acid similarity to Aequorea-derived GFP and its derivatives. We infected 293T cells with this library, and combined FACS with super-infection by a GFP-encoding recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) to isolate GBP1-TagBFP variants whose blue fluorescence depended upon GFP expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; Materials and methods). One hundred GBP1 variants were then individually screened for enhanced TagBFP expression in the presence of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), a GFP derivative known to also interact with GBP1 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rothbauer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tang et al., 2013</a>). Some variants showed fusion TagBFP aggregates within well-transfected cells when YFP was absent, but became soluble in the cytoplasm when YFP was present (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Notably, a GBP1 variant carrying 6 amino acid changes (A25V, E63V, S73R, S98Y, Q109H, S117F) gave little to no TagBFP fluorescence, with no signs of aggregation in the absence of YFP. We focused our efforts on this variant, which will hereafter be referred to as destabilized GBP1 (dGBP1). dGBP1-TagBFP showed strong fluorescence and protein level when co-expressed with GFP or YFP, but became weakly detectable or undetectable when antigen was absent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, unmodified GBP1-TagBFP showed strong fluorescence and protein level regardless of antigen co-expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Interestingly, we detected an increase in the level of wildtype GBP1-TagBFP protein in the presence of YFP (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In an electroporation experiment using the mouse retina, dGBP1-TagBFP fluorescence and protein level were detected only upon GFP co-expression in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Strikingly, the efficiency of TagBFP stabilization by GFP expression was nearly 100%, i.e. almost every GFP+ cell was TagBFP+ (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The efficiency of the TDDOG and CRE-DOG systems was, at the highest, ~60% in similarly designed electroporation experiments (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tang et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2015</a>).\u00a0This difference likely reflects the requirement for delivery of a greater number of components for T-DDOG and CRE-DOG experiments. Taken together, these data show that one can create a highly destabilized Nb whose protein level is dependent upon co-expression with its cognate antigen in vitro and in vivo."

Complex assembly can be inhibited when excessive antigen levels saturate antigen-binding sites in Nb-fusion proteins (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tang et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2015</a>). In contrast, a single polypeptide, dNb-fusion protein should not suffer the same limitation. Indeed, YFP promoted dGBP1-TagBFP stability in a dose-dependent manner, with no adverse effects even when YFP plasmid was transfected at ten-fold excess of dGBP1-TagBFP plasmid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). To investigate the mechanism of dNb destabilization, dGBP1-TagBFP-transfected 293T cells were treated with the ubiquitin proteasome inhibitors, MG132 or Bortezomib (BTZ) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kisselev et al., 2012</a>). dGBP1-TagBFP protein was evident following addition of either inhibitor and was absent without inhibitors, indicating that it was degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>)."

Further, a survey across 76 unique Nb-antigen interfaces, gathered from a total of 102 crystal structures, indicated that Nb positions corresponding to those of dGBP1 A25V, S73R, S98Y and S117F were universally located outside of all Nb-antigen interfaces (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Nb positions corresponding to dGBP1 Q109H fell outside of 99%, or 75 of 76 unique Nb-antigen interfaces. Positions equivalent to dGBP1 E63V were found in 22%, or 17 of 76 unique Nb-antigen interfaces, and in close proximity to the interface in 9%, or 7 of 76 of the cases. Given these results, we hypothesized that the destabilizing framework mutations could be transferred across Nbs to rapidly create antigen-dependent stability. We transferred all dGBP1 mutations (6mut) and the 3maj mutations to Nbs targeting the HIV-1 capsid protein (\u03b1CA) and <i>Escherichia coli</i> dihydrofolate reductase (\u03b1DHFR), respectively. dNbs created by mutation transfer behaved similarly as dGBP1 in that TagBFP fusion fluorescence and protein level both depended upon expression of the cognate antigen (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013E</a>). Destabilization also depended on degradation by the UPS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). We then explored whether dNb-TagBFP expression had an adverse effect on antigen expression. Using western blots to quantify protein levels, we found that dGBP1-TagBFP did not have an obvious effect on YFP protein level, when compared to the negative control condition whereby \u03b1CA<sup>6mut</sup>-TagBFP replaced dGBP1-TagBFP (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>)."

Both enzymes were rendered GFP-dependent after fusion to dGBP1, but not GBP1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>). By increasing the number of dGBP1 domains fused to either enzyme, residual GFP-independent recombination of the initial fusions was decreased without affecting GFP-dependent recombination (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). Notably, Flpo fused to tandemly repeated dGBP1 (dGBP1x2-Flpo, or Flp dependent on GFP [Flp-DOG]) had insignificant background signal and over 600 fold induction by GFP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We also rapidly constructed an Flpo fusion protein dependent upon the C-terminal portion of HIV-1 CA (C-CA) using mutation transfer. This construct was functional in vitro and in vivo(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Further, both GFP- and C-CA-dependent Flpo responded to antigen in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). Thus, dNbs can confer antigen-dependent control over different types of effector proteins, and can adequately reduce the activity of a highly sensitive enzyme when antigen is absent."

GFP and its derivatives (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tsien, 1998</a>) are widely used to label cell types, with specificity dependent upon cellular features such as gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chalfie et al., 1994</a>) or neuronal connectivity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beier et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">DeFalco et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ekstrand et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lo and Anderson, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wickersham et al., 2007</a>). Genetic manipulation of GFP-labeled cells can reveal their functions, but current approaches require delivery of 2 or more \u03b1GFP Nb-fusion proteins (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tang et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2013</a>). Here, we used electroporation and\u00a0rAAV to deliver the one-component Flp-DOG along with Flp-dependent constructs to the retinas of Tg(CRX-GFP) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Samson et al., 2009</a>) and cerebella of Tg(GAD67-GFP) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tamamaki et al., 2003</a>) lines, respectively. In both instances, robust Flpo recombination was detected in GFP+ tissues, but not in GFP-negative tissues labeled with electroporation, infection or injection markers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013E</a>). We used rAAV-delivered Flp-DOG to induce ChR2-mCherry expression in GABAergic Purkinje cells (PCs) of Tg(GAD67-GFP) cerebella (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Under conditions in which infection did not alter spontaneous firing frequency or input resistance, we evoked excitatory photocurrents and synaptic inhibitory currents in ChR2-mCherry+ PCs, with inhibitory inputs from neighboring ChR2-mCherry+ neurons that contacted the recorded PCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2F\u2013G</a>). GFP+ neurons that did not express ChR2-mCherry, as well as control ZsGreen+ neurons in GFP-negative animals, never showed light-evoked photocurrents, indicating antigen-specificity of the system (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus, Flp-DOG provides a much simpler approach to manipulate GFP-defined cell types over pre-existing methods. Overall, these results demonstrate that dNb-fusion proteins enable functional manipulation of antigen-expressing cells in vivo."

Unlike conventional approaches, this cell-targeting strategy does not require knowledge of a cell-specific promoter, modifications of genomic loci, or modification of a cell-specific protein target. Instead, cell type-specificity is achieved by exploiting the intracellular protein expression pattern in cellular systems such as animals or pathogen-infected cells. These conditional reagents were isolated either by using the generalizable screening strategy described here, or by introducing a common set of destabilizing mutations to an ever-expanding repertoire of Nbs (<a href=\"#bib9\">De Meyer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fridy et al., 2014</a>). Previously, laborious screening was required to isolate pairs of Nb-fusion proteins that could reconstitute an activity when they co-occupied an antigen (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tang et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2013</a>). The ability to create single polypeptide, protein-responsive sensors and effectors greatly simplifies design, promotes generalizability, improves performance and enables easier delivery. These approaches should be generalizable to other classes of intracellular protein binders as well."

Indeed, we observed that the most direct output of the GFP/dGBP1 system \u2013 a dGBP1 fusion protein (dGBP1-TagBFP), could be stabilized by YFP with close to 100% efficiency amongst electroporated cells of the retina (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B and C</a>). In comparison, the efficiency of direct reporter output using the T-DDOG and CRE-DOG systems was ~60% in similarly designed experiments, likely due to the need to co-deliver multiple reagents to the same cell (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tang et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2013</a>). Also, whereas the previous dimerizer-based systems were inhibited by excessive amounts of GFP, the activity of Flp-DOG continued to rise along with increasing GFP levels (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tang et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2013</a>). These results highlight the improvements in the GFP/dGBP1 approach compared to previous approaches. However, there are several potential caveats of the GFP/dGBP1 system. First, although Flp-DOG is relatively easier to deliver to tissues as a single-component coding sequence, enhanced construct delivery may lead to enhanced background activity. Indeed, we found that it was necessary to remove the woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) sequence from the rAAV expression cassette in order to avoid background Flp-DOG activity with rAAV infection. Second, tandemly repeated dGBP1s were fused to Flpo in order obtain tight GFP-dependent recombination. The requirement for two GFP molecules to stabilize a single Flp-DOG construct is predicted to reduce the sensitivity of Flp-DOG for lower GFP expression levels. However, in practice, Flp-DOG had adequate activity for the targeting of GFP cell types of the two different transgenic GFP lines tested. Nevertheless, these considerations suggest that one should establish an appropriate level of construct delivery, such as the amount of DNA plasmid or virus to deliver for optimal Flp-DOG performance."

Endogenous proteins would enable one to selectively target specific cell types in wildtype animals for experimentation, without requiring any knowledge of cell type-specific promoters or creation of knock-in alleles. Such an approach would especially benefit studies of non-model organisms, with the only demand being a method to introduce genetic constructs, e.g. via viral vectors. As a possible caveat, the range of biological activities that could be driven by an endogenous protein may be limited by the protein\u2019s natural functions and/or sub-cellular localization. For example, it may be problematic to use a membrane-localized protein to trigger DNA recombination events in the nucleus. One may overcome this by choosing a dNb-fusion protein that, when stabilized, is biologically active in the same sub-cellular localization as that of the antigen. Another possibility is that an antigen-stabilized complex may travel from the site where stability is conferred to another sub-cellular locations to exert its function. These possibilities will likely be idiosyncratic to the fusion protein and antigen. An additional caveat is the effect that a dNb fusion protein might have on the targeted endogenous protein. There could be cases where antigen-Nb interactions lead to less antigen activity. Reduction in activity will depend on several variables. The ratio of Nb fusion to antigen, the binding site of the Nb fusion, and perhaps the particular Nb fusion structure, all have the potential to create changes in antigen activity. Whether or not a reduction in cellular function will be effected will depend upon the sensitivity of the cell to the level of antigen activity. In most heterozygous loss of function mutations in mice and humans, a phenotype is not noted. Although we cannot predict the frequency with which Nb fusions will result in a phenotype, we believe that the method is strong enough to encourage its continued development and application."

Background signals could be addressed by simply increasing the number of dNbs fused to the protein partner.

For example, background activity of dGBP1-Cre could be further controlled by fusion to an ERT2 domain to create small-molecule dependency (<a href=\"#bib14\">Feil et al., 1997</a>). Lastly, one could perform additional screens to isolate novel destabilizing mutant combinations that enhance the antigen-specificity of a wider variety of sensor/effector fusion partners.

Second, the sensitivity of the dNb fusion construct might be sub-optimal. Although the proportion of CA+ cells detected by the dNb sensor was approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of that detected by a mouse monoclonal antibody, the efficiency of antigen detection may be improved by optimization of the dNb fusion construct or of the gene delivery protocol.

The use of dNb fluorescent protein fusions is not limited by this requirement, as the mechanism for background reduction involves protein degradation rather than transcriptional feedback. Indeed, we found that a dNb-TagBFP construct became strictly localized to the nucleus upon co-expression with its NLS-tagged antigen (data not shown)."

Virtually all MMLV-infected cells in culture can be super-infected by rAAV, and the cells remain viable for subsequent culture expansion and FACS. In principle, this screening strategy can be extended to generate a diversity of protein-responsive, destabilized binders based on the Nb scaffold or other protein scaffolds (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wurch et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib25\">Helma et al., 2015</a>)."

We leveraged this resource to establish a phylogenetic and structural basis for transferring destabilizing mutations across Nbs. All successfully modified Nbs were derived from camelid species different from that of GBP1, demonstrating the broad transferability of the mutations discovered here. As one would expect, dNb-TagBFPs generated by mutation transfer showed a spectrum of fluorescence fold-change in response to antigen co-expression. This is likely due to multiple factors, including variable Nb affinity for antigen, variable antigen stability, and variable Nb stability even before destabilization. In addition, Nbs might have variable tolerance to the destabilization mutations tested. Thus, although the high percentage of successful mutation transfers indicate that the strategy is generally applicable, it would be beneficial to derive novel combinations of destabilizing mutations that are even better tolerated across Nbs. Lastly, although dNb generation may be limited by the availability of Nbs isolated from immunized animals, additional Nbs and dNbs may be isolated from in vitro screening technologies that are constantly being improved upon."

As epitope-specific binders are typically generated by varying loops or surfaces on a common structural scaffold, it should be possible to generate epitope-responsive properties by incorporating a common set of mutations onto conserved and non-epitope binding regions of the scaffold. Future developments building upon this work should expand our ability to rapidly generate sensors and effectors against a diversity of intracellular epitopes, for cell- or antigen-specific applications in biology and medicine."

We removed one structure (PDB ID 3J6A) from the analysis because it was a low-resolution structure produced by cryo-electron microscopy. We used the PDBePISA online server tool (<a href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/\">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/</a>) to evaluate whether residue positions equivalent to those of dGBP1 mutations are located outside of antigen-Nb interfaces across different crystallized complexes. PDBePISA produces an analysis of buried surface area (BSA), defined as the solvent-accessible surface area of the corresponding residue that is buried upon interface formation, in \u00c5<sup>2</sup>. We considered an Nb residue to be in the interface with the antigen if its BSA value is above 0 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>. We confirmed that this metric is a reliable indicator of an Nb residue\u2019s proximity to the antigen by examining all structures by eye using tools such as PyMol. In a few cases the Nb bound to more than one antigen. We took this into consideration by analyzing the interfaces formed between an Nb and each of the two antigens. We used protein alignment to determine the residue positions corresponding to the mutations located in dGBP1. The same 76 Nbs were used to determine the extent of GBP1 residue conservation across Nbs."

Processed DsRed binary images were used to guide measurement of mean pixel intensity of TagBFP images in the regions of interests (ROI). Measurements were only made on ROIs that had areas larger than 0.01 inches<sup>2</sup>. To measure background fluorescence of TagBFP images, 5\u201315 squares were drawn in areas devoid of cells and collectively measured for a single mean pixel intensity value per image. This background value was subtracted from individual pixel intensity measurements from each ROI. This background subtraction approach occasionally produced negative values. Negative values were set to zero to enable scaling of data. This manipulation did not affect the representation of the data, since we used the median to represent center of spread and all median values were found to be above zero. Data from each experiment were divided by the median value of the corresponding \u201cunmodified Nb, no antigen condition\u201d, and multiplied by 100 to get a percentage of wildtype fluorescence level. Fold induction was obtained by dividing the median normalized TagBFP fluorescence reading in the \u201cwith antigen\u201d condition by the equivalent value in the \u201cwithout antigen\u201d condition. TagBFP fluorescence measurements and fold induction values were analyzed from at least 3 micrographs, taken from 3 independent experiments. Heat map showing normalized TagBFP fluorescence values was generated in Excel. For each condition, all three replicate values are shown in a series of 3 horizontal colored bars. The color gradient was chosen to emphasize changes between 0 and 40%, because most dNb-TagBFP constructs gave values in this range. Graphs were plotted as the median TagBFP pixel intensity. Values were plotted in Prism (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA)."

GFP+ and ChR2-mCherry+ were imaged using a custom two-photon laser-scanning microscope with 750 nm illumination. Visually guided recordings were performed with ~2 M\u03a9 (PCs) borosilicate glass pipettes (Sutter Instrument). The internal solution for voltage-clamp recordings contained the following (in mM): 140 cesium methanesulfonate, 15 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 2 TEA-Cl, 2 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 10 phosphocreatine-tris2, and 2 QX 314-Cl (pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). Recordings were performed with a 700B Axoclamp amplifier (Molecular Devices) and were controlled with custom software written in Matlab (ScanImage, available on GitHub. Generously provided by B. Sabatini, Harvard Medical School). ChR2-mCherry+ cells were excited using a 473 nm wavelength blue laser (OptoEngine,\u00a0Midvale,\u00a0UT) coupled through the excitation pathway of the microscope. Laser light was focused onto slices through a 40x water-immersion objective. Brief light pulses (0.5\u20131 ms) at an intensity of ~3\u201310 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> evoked ChR2-mediated photocurrents.

Using FACS sorting of 293T cells infected with an MMLV library with random mutations in a GFP-binding nanobody, the authors identified a variant with 6 mutations that is only stable in the presence of endogenous GFP. Three of these mutations, which have the most destabilizing effect when assayed individually, are conserved among most of the characterized nanobodies against different antigens. The authors showed that transferring these mutations to a number of these nanobodies could confer them antigen-dependent stabilization. The authors have shown that by using these mutagenized nanobodies to Flp recombinases and Cas9, they can confer antigen-expressing cells Flp or Cas9 activity with high signal-to-noise ratio, and could allow optogenetic manipulation of GFP-expressing cells via Flp-mediated channelrhodopsin expression. The authors further demonstrate that a nanobody against HIV capsid protein can be used to monitor reactivation of HIV-infected cells by flow cytometry."

It represents a significant improvement of genetic access to cells expressing GFP, an approach pioneered by the same group in two previous studies (Tang et al., 2013, 2015), in that it is more convenient (requires a single transgene), and more versatile in that it can be used to target different effectors (the Flp-DOG is immediately useful for a wide variety of applications). The ability to transfer the antigen-dependent stabilization to other nanobodies will find more applications."

On the basis of a molecular screen the authors identify mutations within the scaffold of an anti-GFP nanobody, that make this molecular unstable by itself, but stable when bound to GFP. They demonstrate that this construct works both in vitro and in vivo when fused with a number of different proteins. They also show that the mutations introduced to GBP1 can be introduced to other nanobodies, where they induce conditional instability, suggesting that this strategy might be widely applicable. Multimerizing the destabilized nanobodies increases the differential in stability between the bound and unbound states for fusions with recombinase enzymes such as Cre and Flpo. Furthermore, these conditionally expressed recombinases demonstrate conditional activity both in vitro and in vivo, and can be used to mediate the conditional expression of optogenetic proteins. Finally, this conditionally stable probe can be used to detect the presence of an antigen that is produced with HIV infection, and thus detect HIV +ve cells."

The low background activity made it extremely sensitive to unevenness in auto-fluorescence in the fields that were imaged.
