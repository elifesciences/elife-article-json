Most studies of mouse NK cells, however, have focused on conventional NK (cNK) cells in the spleen. Recently, we described two populations of liver NK cells, tissue-resident NK (trNK) cells and those resembling splenic cNK cells. However, their lineage relationship was unclear; trNK cells could be developing cNK cells, related to thymic NK cells, or a lineage distinct from both cNK and thymic NK cells. Herein we used detailed transcriptomic, flow cytometric, and functional analysis and transcription factor-deficient mice to determine that liver trNK cells form a distinct lineage from cNK and thymic NK cells. Taken together with analysis of trNK cells in other tissues, there are at least four distinct lineages of NK cells: cNK, thymic, liver (and skin) trNK, and uterine trNK cells."

Most studies of mouse NK cells, however, have focused on conventional NK (cNK) cells in the spleen. Recently, we described two populations of liver NK cells, tissue-resident NK (trNK) cells and those resembling splenic cNK cells. However, their lineage relationship was unclear; trNK cells could be developing cNK cells, related to thymic NK cells, or a lineage distinct from both cNK and thymic NK cells. Herein we used detailed transcriptomic, flow cytometric, and functional analysis and transcription factor-deficient mice to determine that liver trNK cells form a distinct lineage from cNK and thymic NK cells. Taken together with analysis of trNK cells in other tissues, there are at least four distinct lineages of NK cells: cNK, thymic, liver (and skin) trNK, and uterine trNK cells."

However, the thymus\u2014an organ that is another source of white blood cells\u2014contains a sub-population of natural killer cells that are distinct from the conventional splenic natural killer cells. Furthermore, recent work revealed the existence of two types of natural killer cells within the liver: some of these cells were similar to the conventional splenic natural killer cells that circulate throughout the body, while others appeared to be \u2018tissue-resident\u2019 natural killer cells that were poised to deliver an immune response."

In contrast to circulating immune cells are tissue-resident immune cells which already reside in selected organs where they appear to be poised to deliver immune responses.

In knockout mice lacking IL-15 or any chain of the trimeric IL-15R (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), splenic NK cells are absent. The development of splenic NK cells is thought to occur largely if not exclusively in the bone marrow (BM) where cells committed to the NK cell lineage undergo a series of putative developmental stages, characterized by acquisition and loss of various surface markers, including cytokine receptors, NK cell receptors, and integrins (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yokoyama et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Di Santo, 2006</a>).

In the absence of Tbet, splenic NK cells display an immature phenotype, and a subpopulation of NK cells in the liver is absent, consistent with overlapping and cooperative roles of Tbet and Eomes in NK cell development. Alternatively, Tbet may direct the development of a separate lineage of NK cells.

Like the conventional NK (cNK) cells in the spleen, thymic NK cells are cytotoxic and require IL-15 but they differ from cNK cells by their characteristic expression of CD127 (IL-7 receptor \u03b1) and requirement for a thymus where they can arise from early thymocyte precursors (<a href=\"#bib56\">Vosshenrich et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ribeiro et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Vargas et al., 2011</a>).

Interestingly, however, uNK cells appear relatively normal in Tbet-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tayade et al., 2005</a>) and recent studies suggest that a subset of uNK cells can be distinguished from cNK cells (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yadi et al., 2008</a>). Thus, NK cell subsets can be identified in different tissues that appear to be distinguishable from cNK cells."

In parabiotic mice, the host liver contains CD49a<sup>+</sup> DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> NK cells of host origin and circulating CD49a<sup>\u2212</sup>DX5<sup>+</sup> NK cells derived from both host and the other parabiont, indicating that the CD49a<sup>+</sup> DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> cells are tissue-resident NK (trNK) cells whereas the CD49a<sup>\u2212</sup>DX5<sup>+</sup> cells are cNK cells. The trNK cells appear similar to immature cNK cells because they express similar markers (NK1.1, NKp46) but low levels of CD11b, are DX5<sup>\u2212</sup>, and display high levels of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Di Santo , 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Peng et al., 2013</a>).

Basic hierarchical clustering of the three populations revealed that liver trNK cells are distinct from the liver and splenic cNK cells, which in turn, are more closely related to each other than to liver trNK cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). (A higher resolution figure displaying genes most differentially expressed on liver trNK cells is shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>.) Liver trNK cells could be dissimilar from liver and splenic cNK cells perhaps due to their \u2018immature\u2019 phenotype, that is, CD27<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>low</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and TRAIL<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To further explore this possibility, we obtained transcriptome RNA-seq profiles from \u2018immature\u2019 bone marrow (BM) CD49a<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> and CD49a<sup>\u2212</sup>DX5<sup>+</sup> NK cell samples and extracted CD49a<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> and CD49a<sup>\u2212</sup>DX5<sup>+</sup>-specific signatures. When we compared the levels of genes specific to immature CD49a<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> NK cell in the BM (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) to levels of these genes in the other cell subsets, we found that the CD49a<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>\u2013</sup> cells in the liver did not display this cell-type specific pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Since there was some variability in the relative expression levels of individual genes, further examination was performed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in which the genes differentially expressed in the DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> BM subset was compared to the other NK cell subsets and plotted (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Similar analysis was done for genes differentially expressed in the DX5<sup>+</sup> BM subset. These relative comparisons to the DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> subsets showed that the CD49a<sup>\u2212</sup>DX5<sup>+</sup> subsets in BM, liver and spleen were similar to each other (p=0.01). However, the CD49a<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> BM NK cells and liver CD49a<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> trNK cells were dissimilar (p=0.5) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Taken together with our previous analysis with a much more limited panel of cell surface markers (<a href=\"#bib41\">Peng et al., 2013</a>), these transcriptome data strongly suggest that the trNK cells in the liver are not a population of immature NK cells that are transitioning to mature cNK cells rather they represent a separate lineage of NK cells and indicate the CD49a<sup>\u2212</sup>DX5<sup>+</sup> subsets in BM, liver, and spleen likely represent the same recirculating population of cNK cells."

First, we examined the expressed repertoire of Ly49 receptors which are stably expressed on peripheral NK cells. The liver trNK cells express Ly49A, C/I, I, F, and G2 at much lower frequencies than cNK cells from both the liver and spleen (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Indeed, some receptors, such as the Ly49D and Ly49H activation receptors, are not expressed on trNK cells. However the frequencies of liver trNK cells expressing Ly49E (Ly49EF<sup>+</sup> but Ly49F<sup>\u2212</sup>) and NKG2A are much higher than liver and splenic cNK cells. In addition, the liver trNK cells appear larger and more granular by scatter parameters when compared to the liver and splenic cNK cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Since these parameters are associated with activated cNK cells, we examined expression of other activation markers. In na\u00efve mice, the liver trNK cells express higher levels of CD69, CD44, CD160 and do not express CD62L as compared to the cNK cells in the liver and spleen, consistent with a more activated state."

To directly test these hypotheses and gain insight into the developmental relationship of liver trNK cells to cNK cells, we analyzed the mRNA levels of several transcription factors involved in cNK cell development. Particularly informative was decreased transcript levels of eomesodermin (Eomes) in the liver trNK cells as compared to liver and splenic cNK cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The differences in Eomes transcript levels were verified by flow cytometry which showed lower levels of Eomes protein in liver trNK as compared to cNK cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gordon et al., 2012</a>). By contrast, there was no relative difference between liver trNK cells and liver and splenic cNK cells in Tbx21 (Tbet) expression at either the transcript or protein level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Transcription factor staining was performed as previously described for Tbx21 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sojka and Fowell, 2011</a>). Thus, liver trNK cells express different levels of Eomes compared to spleen cNK cells, suggesting different requirements for the related Tbox transcription factor, Tbet, which plays an overlapping role with Eomes in cNK cell development (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gordon et al., 2012</a>)."

In addition to the liver, we found large percentages of CD49a<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> NK cells in the uterus and skin but not in other organs examined (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), suggesting that CD49a may be a marker of trNK cells in these organs. The CD49a<sup>+</sup> NK cells in the uterus and skin also generally lacked expression of DX5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and displayed constitutive expression of CD69, much like the liver trNK cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). To determine if the CD49a<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>\u2013</sup> cells were resident to the uterus and skin, we studied parabiotic mice as we had done previously to help establish the tissue residency of CD49a<sup>+</sup> DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> NK cells in the liver (<a href=\"#bib41\">Peng et al., 2013</a>). At 2 weeks post surgery, we assessed both the trNK and cNK cells in the uterus and skin in each parabiont by flow cytometry by gating on the appropriate CD45.1 or CD45.2 congenic marker in order to differentiate host-derived cells from circulating cells from the other parabiont. In both the uterus and skin, host CD49a<sup>+</sup> DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> NK cells were primarily found in the indicated host tissue (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,F</a>), similar to the CD49a<sup>+</sup> DX5<sup>\u2212</sup> trNK cells in the liver (<a href=\"#bib41\">Peng et al., 2013</a>). By contrast, CD45 allotype-disparate mice reached nearly complete chimerism in the spleen (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wright et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Peng et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, the CD49a<sup>\u2212</sup>DX5<sup>+</sup> NK cells of both allotypes were found in both parabionts, indicating that they were circulating NK cells, akin to the CD49a<sup>\u2212</sup>DX5<sup>+</sup> cNK cells in the liver (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,F</a>). Thus, the uterus and skin contain both trNK (CD49a<sup>+</sup> DX5<sup>\u2212</sup>) and circulating cNK (CD49a<sup>\u2212</sup>DX5<sup>+</sup>) cNK cells, with the trNK cells appearing to dominate the uterine NK cell population."

However, emerging data indicate that a number of different immune cell types appear to be tissue-resident and rarely recirculate. Here we demonstrate that NK cells are also comprised of circulating and several tissue-resident cell types in the liver, skin and uterus. Our comprehensive transcriptome and FACS analyses on liver trNK cells and liver and splenic cNK cells suggested that they may be distinct lineages of NK cells. Indeed, circulating liver and splenic cNK cells were absent in NFIL3-deficient mice, further demonstrating their lineage relationship to each other. On the other hand, NFIL3-deficient mice still possessed trNK cells in the liver, skin, and uterus. Moreover, Tbet-deficient mice lacked trNK cells in the liver and skin but uterine trNK cells and cNK cells in the liver and spleen were largely intact. Finally, thymic NK cells represent a distinct NK cell lineage because they are absent in nude and GATA-3-deficient mice which generally possess cNK and trNK cells. Taken together, these data suggest that there are at least four lineages of NK cells: cNK cells circulating in spleen, blood and other organs, thymic, and two trNK cell lineages\u2014liver (and skin), and uterine."

In the liver, skin, and uterus, they differentially express CD49a, though it is possible that trNK cells in other organs preferentially express another marker. Concomitantly, they lack DX5 expression which is generally expressed as a late maturation marker on most cNK cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Peng et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, trNK cells from unmanipulated mice display markers associated with cNK cell activation, such as CD69, in contrast to cNK cells which do not express CD69 until activated (<a href=\"#bib27\">Karlhofer and Yokoyama, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wang et al., 2000</a>). The trNK cells also express a different repertoire of Ly49 receptors, suggesting that they may be tolerant to self by using mechanisms that do not strictly employ MHC class I-dependent licensing by Ly49 receptors, as has been shown for cNK cells in the spleen (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Elliott and Yokoyama, 2011</a>). The trNK cells efficiently produce other cytokines, particularly TNF\u03b1 and GM-CSF which may contribute to inflammatory conditions in a manner distinct from cNK cells which predominantly produce IFN\u03b3. TNF\u03b1 production occurs following stimulation by target cells and also occurs in trNK cells producing IFN\u03b3. Finally, trNK cells utilize a separate set of transcription factors which may endow trNK cells with other unique functions, in addition to lineage commitment. As such, due to their tissue localization and these distinctive features, trNK cells most likely play important roles in innate defense in ways that should be distinguishable from cNK cells. Future investigations to re-examine the contribution of NK cells in different organs with a focus on trNK cells should reveal these roles."

While more detailed analysis of the progenitors for NK cells will be required to establish the precise lineage relationship of trNK and cNK cells to each other, current data, particularly cytotoxic potential and IL-15-dependence, support their intimate relationship, despite differences in transcription factor requirements."

While this area of research is fluid with potentially more cells to be identified and additional characteristics to be discovered, it now appears that ILCs can be separated into three groups, based on shared characteristics (<a href=\"#bib49\">Spits et al., 2013</a>). cNK cells are now classified as belonging to the group 1 ILCs, due to their shared production of IFN\u03b3. cNK cells can be distinguished from other group 1 ILCs by their cytotoxic capacities, dependence on IL-15, and general lack of IL7R\u03b1 expression, features shared between cNK and liver, skin, and uterine trNK cells. Recently, a new IFN\u03b3-producing ILC1 cell was identified which demonstrated dependence on NFIL3, Tbx21, and IL-15 but not IL-15R\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fuchs et al., 2013</a>), unlike the trNK cells described here. Finally, while the relationship of thymic NK cells expressing CD127 to ILCs which also express CD127 may need further refinement, current knowledge suggest that the liver (skin) and uterine trNK cells are more related to cNK cells than ILCs."

In the uterus, immature NK cells have been described as well as a phenotypically related but distinct population of cells that express the transcription factor RORC and produce IL-22, suggesting that they may be ILC3s rather than NK cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Crellin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Male et al., 2010</a>).

Of these, NKT cells are of special interest because they share several characteristics with trNK cells in the liver. NKT cells were first identified because they express markers associated with NK cells, such as NK1.1, but are not cNK cells because they express rearranged TCR genes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bendelac et al., 2007</a>). While they are now known to recognize glycolipids presented by CD1 molecules, a large number of NKT cells also reside in the liver, though they can be found in other tissues. In the liver, NKT cells crawl within the sinusoidal space by patrolling sinusoidal endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Geissmann et al., 2005</a>). This is reminiscent of early electron microscopy studies of the rat liver which identified \u2018pit cells\u2019, now recognized as NK cells (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wisse et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bouwens et al., 1987</a>). Pit cells are found in the sinusoidal space usually adjacent to sinusoidal endothelial cells.

Our studies indicate that trNK cells appear to have an activated phenotype with expression of CD69 and other activation markers as well as other phenotypic changes.

In particular, due to early hematopoiesis occurring in the fetal liver, liver trNK cell precursors may seed the liver during embryonic life. In this regard, it is interesting to note that Ly49E was first noted to be almost exclusively expressed on fetal NK cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Toomey et al., 1998</a>). However, recent findings (<a href=\"#bib16\">Filtjens et al., 2013</a>) and those reported here indicate that liver trNK cells in adult mice also selectively express Ly49E, raising the possibility that Ly49E<sup>+</sup> NK cells in the fetus reflect trNK cells already present in the embryonic liver, at a time when cNK cells are poorly developed (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bukowski et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dorfman and Raulet, 1998</a>). As such, since the liver is the major site for fetal hematopoiesis, Ly49E<sup>+</sup> NK cells may not reflect fetal NK cells per se but instead the possibility that precursor of trNK cells seeds the liver during early life. Consistent with this possibility, we recently showed that precursors of liver trNK cells are present in the adult liver (<a href=\"#bib41\">Peng et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, adult BM hematopoietic stem cells do not fully reconstitute the liver trNK cell population in irradiated mice. Thus, precursors of trNK cells, like \u03b3\u03b4T cells and certain tissue macrophages (<a href=\"#bib23\">Havran and Allison, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schulz et al., 2012</a>), may seed tissues early in life, a topic that will require further evaluation."

Their tissue residency feature suggests that they have tissue-specific homeostatic functions. Our studies should prompt a re-examination of the myriad roles of NK cells in many immune responses which could be due to trNK cells, rather than cNK cells. Finally, our studies may also be applicable to emerging data on other hematopoietic cells that circulate throughout the body in that there may be related but distinct cell types that are tissue-resident."

Based on phenotypic and functional analysis as well as dependency on several transcription factors, the authors conclude that at least 4 lineages of NK cells can be defined: conventional NK cells that circulate in the blood (cNK), thymic NK cells, and two types of trNK cells (liver/skin versus uterus). NK cell diversity is a subject of interest as NK cell function may vary in different tissues depending on environmental cues. This knowledge is important in order to understand how NK cells act during immune responses and also if they have roles in tissue homeostasis. This manuscript is quite interesting and for the most part the experiments are well performed and analyzed. The following points should be addressed in a revised version:"

In the published study, they identified the unique and stable CD49a<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>-</sup> liver NK population (the trNK) and showed that it is phenotypically and functionally distinct from cNK, including differential hapten memory. The present study expands on the phenotypic and functional differences between trNK and cNK, but its main point, according to the title, is that the trNKs represent a distinct lineage. However, this conclusion is based largely on differential dependencies on transcription factors. And the only really convincing case is that of NFIL3 \u2013 the other dependencies could reflect effects on survival, niche residency, etc. The manuscript would be bolstered by concordant data from more classical ways to weigh lineage sharing, for example, genetic tagging experiments or precursor\u2013product assessments. For example, concerning the latter, and given recent data on tissue macrophages, are both trNK and cNK derived from bone-marrow HSCs? A relatively easy experiment to do."

We have similar results in our lab. The partial reconstitution could be due to several reasons. First, there may be a renewing precursor cell in the liver that generates the population, as suggested by experiments in the Peng paper where liver lineage<sup>\u2212</sup> cells could give rise to CD49a<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>-</sup> trNK cells in the liver. Second, precursor cells from fetal liver may seed the organ early on in life and adult BM HSCs only partially retain this property. We agree that the origin of the trNK cells in the various organs is very interesting and we had already mentioned these points in the Discussion, but based on the published and current results, further dissection of this issue appears to require an undertaking that exceeds the scope of the current manuscript."
