                    "text": "Recent studies suggested an essential role for seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) in vascular development. This role is specific to SerRS among all tRNA synthetases and is independent of its well-known aminoacylation function in protein synthesis. A unique nucleus-directing domain, added at the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition, confers this novel non-translational activity of SerRS. Previous studies showed that SerRS, in some unknown way, controls VEGFA expression to prevent vascular over-expansion. Using in vitro, cell and animal experiments, we show here that SerRS intervenes by antagonizing c-Myc, the major transcription factor promoting VEGFA expression, through a tandem mechanism. First, by direct head-to-head competition, nuclear-localized SerRS blocks c-Myc from binding to the <i>VEGFA</i> promoter. Second, DNA-bound SerRS recruits the SIRT2 histone deacetylase to erase prior c-Myc-promoted histone acetylation. Thus, vertebrate SerRS and c-Myc is a pair of \u2018Yin-Yang\u2019 transcriptional regulator for proper development of a functional vasculature. Our results also discover an anti-angiogenic activity for SIRT2."

                    "text": "Recent studies suggested an essential role for seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) in vascular development. This role is specific to SerRS among all tRNA synthetases and is independent of its well-known aminoacylation function in protein synthesis. A unique nucleus-directing domain, added at the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition, confers this novel non-translational activity of SerRS. Previous studies showed that SerRS, in some unknown way, controls VEGFA expression to prevent vascular over-expansion. Using in vitro, cell and animal experiments, we show here that SerRS intervenes by antagonizing c-Myc, the major transcription factor promoting VEGFA expression, through a tandem mechanism. First, by direct head-to-head competition, nuclear-localized SerRS blocks c-Myc from binding to the <i>VEGFA</i> promoter. Second, DNA-bound SerRS recruits the SIRT2 histone deacetylase to erase prior c-Myc-promoted histone acetylation. Thus, vertebrate SerRS and c-Myc is a pair of \u2018Yin-Yang\u2019 transcriptional regulator for proper development of a functional vasculature. Our results also discover an anti-angiogenic activity for SIRT2."

However, the role of SerRS in vascular development is independent of its enzymatic activity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fukui et al., 2009</a>), but dependent on its vertebrate-specific, non-catalytic, C-terminal domain UNE-S (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Xu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Guo and Schimmel, 2013</a>). The UNE-S domain contains a robust nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence that, at least in human cells, directs a substantial amount of cellular SerRS into the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Xu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Guo and Schimmel, 2013</a>). Remarkably, all non-null mutations of <i>sars</i> linked to vasculature abnormalities in the aforementioned genetics studies either have the NLS truncated or conformationally sequestered, and thus render deficient SerRS nuclear localization (<a href=\"#bib41\">Xu et al., 2012</a>). Conversely, zebrafish expressing engineered catalytically active but NLS-mutated SerRS exhibited the same abnormal blood vessel phenotype as observed in the <i>sars</i> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#bib41\">Xu et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, it has been clearly established that the essential role of SerRS in vascular development arises from its evolutionarily acquired nuclear presence."

This observation suggested that the nuclear function of SerRS in zebrafish is linked to attenuating the expression of Vegfa. However, the mechanism of the SerRS function has remained obscure. Because VEGFA is a key stimulator of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis for all vertebrates, and over-expression of VEGFA is not only associated with developmental vascular abnormalities, but also contributes to various diseases including cancer (<a href=\"#bib8\">Drake and Little, 1995</a>), we were motivated to determine whether the VEGFA-regulating function of SerRS is conserved in higher vertebrates such as humans, and what is the mechanism by which nuclear SerRS controls VEGFA expression."

As a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZ) protein, c-Myc functions through heterodimerization with the small bHLHZ partner MAX for binding to the Enhancer Box (E-box) DNA sequence (5\u2032-CACGTG-3\u2032) on its target genes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blackwood and Eisenman, 1991</a>). DNA-bound c-Myc recruits histone acetyltransferase to acetylate histone proteins to allow chromatin expansion and activate transcription (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grandori et al., 2000</a>). c-Myc knockout mice are embryonic lethal and exhibit, among others deformities, under-developed vasculature. Importantly, these deformities can be partially rescued by transgenic VEGFA expression (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baudino et al., 2002</a>). On the other hand, endothelial-specific c-Myc overexpression in mice also causes embryonic lethality arising from widespread edema, multiple hemorrhagic lesions and severe defects in the vascular network, accompanied by an elevated level of VEGFA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kokai et al., 2009</a>). Together, these results suggest that the role of c-Myc in vascular development and in promoting VEGFA expression has to be tightly balanced."

These results and further experiments in a vertebrate model organism reveal that SerRS is a key balancing antagonist of c-Myc for regulation of VEGFA expression, as well as for proper development of a functional vasculature. In addition, our study provides the first report of an anti-angiogenic function for SIRT2, which arises at least in part through its interaction with SerRS."

A short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the 3\u2032 UTR of human SerRS mRNA was generated to knock down endogenous SerRS expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and HEK 293 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). For both cell types, the level of <i>VEGFA</i> transcript was more than doubled in cells expressing the shRNA against SerRS (sh-SerRS) vs a control shRNA (sh-Con) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Considering that SerRS is an essential component of the translation machinery and that knockdown of SerRS would have a general effect on protein synthesis that may obscure the effect on VEGFA expression, we compensated the \u2018knockout\u2019 cells by expression of NLS-deleted SerRS (\u0394NLS) that is fully active in aminoacylation but lost the ability to enter the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib41\">Xu et al., 2012</a>), or by expression of wild-type (WT) SerRS (as a separate control). Remarkably, compared to WT SerRS-expressing cells, cells expressing \u0394NLS SerRS resulted in three and fourfold higher expression of VEGFA in HUVECs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), respectively. This result supports the idea that the role of nuclear SerRS in suppressing VEGFA expression is conserved from fish to humans. In addition, as measured in an in vitro endothelial tube formation assay, and consistent with the role of VEGFA in promoting angiogenesis, HUVECs expressing \u0394NLS SerRS showed a much stronger propensity (than WT SerRS-expressing cells) to form a blood vessel-like tubular network (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>)."

SerRS functions as a dimer in aminoacylation and the dimerization interface is mediated through the catalytic domain (CD). The N-terminal tRNA binding domain (TBD) of SerRS is used for recognizing the long variable arm of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>, while the C-terminal UNE-S domain directs SerRS into the nucleus. Deletion of TBD or UNE-S dramatically weakens or completely abolishes the DNA interaction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In fact, only the intact SerRS can bind to DNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), suggesting that multiple domains of SerRS contribute to the DNA interaction."

Two additional deletions\u2014\u0394V2-G14 in TBD and \u0394T413-V420 in CD\u2014also abolish the DNA binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Based on these results and our previously solved crystal structures of human SerRS (<a href=\"#bib41\">Xu et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2013</a>), we modeled the SerRS\u2013DNA interaction. As shown in <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, motif V2-G14 and loop T413-V420, located next to each other in 3D space, bind to one end of the DNA, while insertion I in TBD (G75-N97) binds to the other end; insertion II in CD (G254-N261), as well as the UNE-S domain, which is disordered in the crystal structure of SerRS, would interact with the middle region of the DNA near the E-box."

It is important to note that the binding affinity of the SerRS\u2013DNA interaction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) is comparable to that of the c-Myc/MAX\u2013DNA interaction (90.5 \u223c 229 nM) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hu et al., 2005</a>). Indeed, in HEK 293 cells and measuring by real time qRT-PCR, ectopic expression of WT (but not NLS-deleted) SerRS repressed the overexpression of VEGFA driven by c-Myc (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Consistently, our EMSA and Western blot analyses clearly showed that SerRS, at the same concentrations, could compete in vitro with the c-Myc/MAX complex for binding to the 27-bp DNA fragment from the <i>VEGFA</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This possibility was investigated in zebrafish as a vertebrate model system. As expected (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fukui et al., 2009</a>), knocking down SerRS by injection of an antisense morpholino (SerRS-MO) resulted in a hyper-intersegmental vessel (ISV) branching phenotype in zebrafish (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), and the phenotype was accompanied with an elevated level of Vefga expression (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Specifically, out of 130 fish embryos injected with SerRS-MO, 72 (55.4%) exhibited hyper-ISV phenotype, as oppose to 2.9% (n = 4 out of 140) of fish injected with a control morpholino (control-MO). Although a small number of fish injected with SerRS-MO exhibited the opposite vascular defect (hypo-ISV phenotype), the number is not significantly different from that in the control-MO group (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Overall, without SerRS, there is an over-expansion of the vasculature."

In particular, 41.4% (n = 24 out of 58) of Myca-MO-injected morphants exhibits hypo-ISV phenotype, as opposed to 10% (n = 14 out of 140) of control-MO-injected morphants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Remarkably, co-injection of Myca-MO with SerRS-MO efficiently rescued both hyper-ISV (10.7%, n = 18 out of 169) and hypo-ISV (10.1%, n = 17 out of 169) defects (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Coincidently, co-injection of Myca-MO also partially reversed the high Vegfa expression level in SerRS-MO-injected zebrafish (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, a counteracting effect between c-Myc and SerRS in vascular development was confirmed in a vertebrate system. These results highlight a \u2018Yin-Yang\u2019 regulation of SerRS and c-Myc on VEGFA expression and demonstrate that a delicate balance between them is essential for developing a functional vasculature."

Of the seven mammalian sirtuin isoforms, relatively little is known about SIRT2. Considering that c-Myc activates gene expression by recruiting partners harboring histone acetyltransferase activity that modifies histones and leads to open chromatin structures (<a href=\"#bib26\">McMahon et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amati et al., 2001</a>), we postulated that an interaction between SerRS and SIRT2 might reverse this process to attenuate VEGFA expression.

Full-length SerRS or its domain fragments were fused with GST at N-termini to pull down purified His-tagged SIRT2. SIRT2 was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibody, and the GST fusion proteins attached on the Glutathione-Sepharose beads were analyzed using ponceau S staining.

(<b>E</b>) Effect of SerRS on SIRT2 deacetylation activity. Recombinant human SIRT2 (1 \u00b5M) were incubated with purified SerRS (concentration measured as monomer) at the indicated ratios. The deacetylase activities of SIRT2 were measured by using a substrate peptide with one end coupled to a fluorophore and the other end to a quencher. An internal acetylated lysine residue serves as the substrate of SIRT2, and the deacetylation allows the peptide to be cleaved by a lysylendopeptidase to release the fluorophore from the quencher to emit fluorescence. Therefore, the SIRT2 acitivity was measured by monitoring the fluororescence intensity (excitation at 490 nm and emission at 530 nm). A reaction without NAD<sup>+</sup> (NAD<sup>+</sup> [\u2212]) was performed as a negative control."

To address this question, we first mapped the SerRS binding site on SIRT2 by coimmunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). SIRT2 is a 389-aa protein, whose crystal structure has been solved (<a href=\"#bib11\">Finnin et al., 2001</a>). The catalytic core of SIRT2 is flanked by \u223c60 aa and \u223c50 aa on the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively. Through a series of truncations from each end, we determined that both N- and C-terminal regions, outside the catalytic core of SIRT2, interact with SerRS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Particularly, residues within the regions of G52-D60 and W337-S356 are critical, as the loss of either region abolished the interaction of SIRT2 with SerRS. Interestingly, both regions are located on the opposite side of the substrate-binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), suggesting that bound SerRS should not interfere with the deacetylase activity of SIRT2. To confirm the postulation, we directly assessed the effect of SerRS on the in vitro deacetylase activity of SIRT2. Remarkably, at an equal molar ratio (1:1), SerRS did not inhibit but rather promoted the deacetylase activity of SIRT2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Because increasing the SerRS concentration to 1:2 ratio (SIRT2: SerRS) did not provide any additional enhancement (but rather a small decline at early time points), the enhancement effect is likely to result from the specific interaction between SerRS and SIRT2, at a location distal to the active site."

The critical role of SIRT2 in the mechanism of SerRS to inhibit VEGFA expression and vascular expansion suggests that SIRT2 could be associated with an anti-angiogenic function, and that knocking down SIRT2 may mimic the vasculature abnormality phenotype caused by a SerRS knockdown. We tested this hypothesis in the zebrafish system<i>.</i> Consistent with the previous report showing a VEGFA-independent pro-angiogenic role for SIRT1 in vascular development (<a href=\"#bib33\">Potente et al., 2007</a>), injection of an antisense morpholino against Sirt1 (SIRT1 homologue in zebrafish) generated the hypo-ISV phenotype (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) and had no significant effect on Vegfa expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). In contrast, injection of a <i>Sirt2-MO</i> resulted in the same hyper-ISV phenotype (42.1%, n = 75 out 178) as with the injection of SerRS-MO (46.7%, n = 119 out of 255) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Furthermore, the hyper-ISV phenotype, in both cases, was accompanied by a significantly elevated level of the <i>vegfa</i> transcript (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Therefore, our studies have revealed an anti-angiogenic role of SIRT2, which should be, at least in part, dependent on attenuating VEGFA expression through its interaction with SerRS."

Therefore, Mad proteins are generally considered as antagonists of c-Myc, especially with regard to the role of c-Myc in tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zhou and Hurlin, 2001</a>). However, the role of Mad proteins in vascular development appears to be non-essential. Disruption of members of the Mad family in mice does not exhibit any vascular phenotype (<a href=\"#bib12\">Foley et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schreiber-Agus et al., 1998</a>). In addition, the temporal expression pattern varies between c-Myc and the Mad family proteins, with c-Myc being expressed during development, while expression of Mad proteins is mainly induced during terminal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Queva et al., 1998</a>). Thus, the Mad proteins are largely silent during the time that the vasculature is being established, which could explain their non-essential role in vascular development. In comparison, SerRS' ubiquitous expression as an essential tRNA synthetase could match better with that of c-Myc to provide the counterbalance."

Although c-Myc plays a key role in vascular development, the gene first appeared in <i>Drosphila</i>, an invertebrate with a primitive \u2018open\u2019 circulatory system. The appearance of the MAX and Mad family genes is even earlier, and the genes were first identified in roundworms such as <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Atchley and Fitch, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Prendergast, 1999</a>). In contrast, although SerRS is considered as one of the most ancient proteins, its UNE-S domain, which harbors the NLS signal to endow SerRS with its novel transcription repressor activity, only appeared in vertebrates. Thus, it seems that an \u2018old\u2019 tRNA synthetase evolved to function as a \u2018new\u2019 and essential antagonist against c-Myc for proper development of the advanced closed circulatory system of vertebrates."

In fact, a complete reversal of the inhibitory effect of SerRS on VEGFA expression was observed when SIRT2 was knocked out by RNAi or inhibited by EX527 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). This observation indicates that the transcriptional repressor role of SerRS is ultimately through SIRT2 and that the direct blocking of c-Myc from the promoter by SerRS may have lesser significance for downregulating gene expression. Thus, an overlapping DNA binding site may not be a prerequisite for SerRS to antagonize c-Myc, as long as both SerRS and c-Myc bind to the same promoter. Considering the large number of genes that are regulated by c-Myc, one would not be surprised to find additional genes to be transcriptionally repressed by SerRS, presumably also through its collaboration with SIRT2."

We speculate that SerRS also functions as a tumor suppressor by collaborating with SIRT2 to antagonize c-Myc. Interestingly, human <i>SARS</i> is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 (i.e., 1p13.3), which is frequently affected by rearrangements or allelic loss in a variety of human malignancies (<a href=\"#bib29\">Morgan et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mitchell and Santibanez-Koref, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mathew et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Munn et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nagai et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Xu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Caramazza et al., 2009</a>). The frequent disruption of this chromosomal locus in human malignancies suggests the presence of tumor suppressor genes which, when perturbed, lead to increased cancer susceptibility. Because SerRS is also essential for survival through its function in protein synthesis, if it is a factor in any of these malignancies, then its function in translation would need to be preserved. This could be achieved by disruption of the UNE-S domain, which does not affect aminoacylation, but is essential for SerRS to antagonize c-Myc."

To compensate for the loss of endogenous SerRS expression, the coding region for GFP in the pLentiLox-hH1 plasmid was replaced with NLS-deleted or WT (as control) SerRS coding sequences. All designed shRNAs target sequences within the open reading frame except for the SerRS shRNA, which targets the 3\u2032 untranslated region in ordered to selectively knockdown the endogenous gene but not the exogenous genes. The recombinant lentiviruses were produced in packaging 293 cells by cotransfecting the pLentiLox-hH1 plasmid with two helper packaging plasmids \u03948.9 and VSVG and subsequently concentrated by centrifugation at 50,000\u00d7<i>g</i> for 3 hr."

The major findings are 1) SerRS binds directly to the VEGF promoter at a site that overlaps with a binding site for cMyc. 2) In vivo and in vitro experiments provide evidence that SerRS can compete for cMyc for binding at these sites. 3) The authors confirm a prior proteomic result suggesting interaction of SerRS with SIRT2. Evidence is presented that is consistent with SerRS acting to recruit SIRT2 to the VEGFA promoter where it actively represses VEGFA expression via histone deacetylation. Loss of function experiments in zebrafish that focus on vascular branching are supportive of mutually antagonistic roles of cMyc and SerRS in controlling vascular development, at least in part through regulation of the expression of VEGFA."

The second reviewer stated, 'The findings are very novel, exciting, and important. The approach takes advantage of cell culture, in vitro, and zebrafish technologies, and is elegant, well-designed, and with appropriate controls.'"

To further define the DNA binding site on SerRS, we made 4 additional deletion mutants of SerRS at strategic positions. All 4 mutants lost the DNA binding activity.

Two double mutants of the E-box, including one that would completely abolish c-Myc/Max binding, did not affect the SerRS interaction; on the other hand, 5 different single mutations outside the E-box (on both the 5\u2019 and the 3\u2019 sides) that would not affect c-Myc/Max binding greatly weakened SerRS binding, indicating that SerRS and c-Myc/Max have distinct DNA binding specificities. These new data is now added to the manuscript and is part of the new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>."
