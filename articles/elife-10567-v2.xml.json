They were hypothesized to originate from embryonic progenitor cells that acquire long-term self-renewal ability and multipotency at the end of organogenesis. The process through which this is achieved often remains unclear. Here, we discovered that long-term hair follicle stem cells arise from embryonic progenitor cells occupying a niche location that is defined by attenuated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Hair follicle initiation is marked by placode formation, which depends on the activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Soon afterwards, a region with attenuated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling emerges in the upper follicle. Embryonic progenitor cells residing in this region gain expression of adult stem cell markers and become definitive long-term hair follicle stem cells at the end of organogenesis. Attenuation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is a prerequisite for hair follicle stem cell specification because it suppresses Sox9, which is required for stem cell formation."

They were hypothesized to originate from embryonic progenitor cells that acquire long-term self-renewal ability and multipotency at the end of organogenesis. The process through which this is achieved often remains unclear. Here, we discovered that long-term hair follicle stem cells arise from embryonic progenitor cells occupying a niche location that is defined by attenuated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Hair follicle initiation is marked by placode formation, which depends on the activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Soon afterwards, a region with attenuated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling emerges in the upper follicle. Embryonic progenitor cells residing in this region gain expression of adult stem cell markers and become definitive long-term hair follicle stem cells at the end of organogenesis. Attenuation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is a prerequisite for hair follicle stem cell specification because it suppresses Sox9, which is required for stem cell formation."

It has been postulated that definitive tissue SCs originate from tissue embryonic progenitor cells that acquire the capacity for long-term self-renewal and multipotency at the end of organogenesis (<a href=\"#bib47\">Slack, 2008</a>).

Previous studies using label-retaining methods demonstrated that putative HFSCs are present in postnatal developing HFs as slow cycling cells, and it was shown that their specification requires the transcription factor Sox9 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nowak et al., 2008</a>). Intriguingly, placode cells already express adult HFSC markers such as Lhx2 and Sox9, although in a largely non-overlapping pattern.

These dynamic expression patterns suggest that cells in the placode and hair peg are heterogeneous. However, whether or not HFSC fate is already pre-determined at these early developmental stages is not clear. Other critical unanswered questions include the following: Are adult HFSCs remnant of embryonic progenitor cells that maintain their embryonic developmental potential, or do they, alternatively, come from progenitor cells that gain long-term potential? What are the underlying mechanisms? What determines the niche location and where do HFSCs become localized? The current study addresses these key questions."

Unexpectedly, <i>Shh</i>-expressing hair peg cells lost the ability to form HFSCs and mostly contributed to differentiated lineages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Since <i>Shh</i>-expressing placode cells generate the majority of cells in hair peg, including those still expressing <i>Shh</i>, this intriguing change in cell fate indicates that progenies of <i>Shh</i>-expressing placode cells separate into two different populations: the population still expressing <i>Shh</i> loose the potential to form HFSCs, while the cells with down regulated <i>Shh</i> expression in hair peg can presumably still become HFSCs."

Using <i>Nfatc1-CreER::Rosa-stop-mTmG</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tian et al., 2014</a>), we found that <i>Nfatc1</i>-expressing cells first appear at the upper hair peg and remain relatively dormant there, without actively contributing to HF down growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Then, at the end of organogenesis, <i>Nfatc1</i>-expressing hair peg cells become the sebaceous gland above bulge and most of the HFSCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

Using <i>Lgr5-GFP-CreER::Rosa-stop-tdTomato</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jaks et al., 2008</a>), we found that <i>Lgr5</i>-expressing cells appear first in the middle portion of the hair peg.

The hair peg SC precursors are distinguished from the broader placode and hair germ cells in that they stop further development once they are specified. During subsequent HF down growth, these cells remain dormant in their original position until the end of organogenesis. At that point, they incorporate into the outer layer of the bulge and become HFSCs. This leads to an interesting question: is the reason these cells gain expression of stem cell markers and become dormant due to signals that they receive at the specific upper follicle position?"

For the purpose of identifying niche-defining factors, we focused on genes associated with extracellular signal paths. Rather than identifying signals that were uniquely present in hair peg niche occupying cells (<i>Nfatc1+</i> cells), we found signals that were uniquely absent from these cells. Based on DAVID functional gene annotation analysis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dennis et al., 2003</a>), among genes that were expressed \u22652-fold more in <i>Shh</i>+ cells than in <i>Nfatc1</i>+ cells, we found that genes of the Wnt signaling pathway were enriched prominently (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Several canonical Wnts and some well-known Wnt/\u03b2-catenin target genes, including <i>Axin2,</i> were highly expressed in <i>Shh</i>+ cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>).

Sox9 is known to be an essential intrinsic factor that is required for HFSC formation. Ablation of epithelial <i>Sox9</i> completely blocks HFSC specification (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nowak et al., 2008</a>). To determine if the canonical Wnt signal suppresses Sox9 expression in HFs, first we observed that in normal developing HFs, Sox9 expressing cells and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal responsive cells are mutually exclusive (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Second, soon after activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in <i>Nfatc1+</i> cells, we observed small protrusions from HFs that were positive for nuclear \u03b2-catenin. Sox9 expression in these small protrusions was completely absent, while cells immediately next to these protrusions express Sox9 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Lastly, in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin loss of function mutant (<i>K14-rtTA::teto-Cre::Ctnnb1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i>) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nguyen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Perl et al., 2002</a>), HF development is defective but Sox9 expression is expanded to the extent that all remaining cells in HFs express Sox9 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H-J</a>). These results suggest that the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling suppresses Sox9 expression in HFs. Given that the loss of Sox9 expression completely blocks HFSC specification, the requirement for attenuation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling as a prerequisite for HFSC specification is related to enabling Sox9 expression. It is noteworthy that hair shaft formation is aborted in <i>K14-rtTA::teto-Cre::Ctnnb1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>). This indicates that epithelial Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is required for progenitor cell differentiation, and may further explain why activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling prevents HFSC formation."

This suggests that there are two origins of HFSCs: a small portion of HFSCs come from hair peg cells maintaining active Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, while the majority HFSCs come from progenitor cells with attenuated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in hair peg. To investigate the long-term consequences of this heterogeneity, we followed the fates of HFSCs from the two different origins through multiple hair cycles; the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal positive origin was represented by the <i>Axin+</i> lineage while the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal negative origin was represented by the <i>Sox9+</i> lineage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

We have shown that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is required for terminal differentiation of the hair shaft. Also it suppresses Sox9 expression, which is important for HFSC maintenance through inhibition of differentiation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kadaja et al., 2014</a>). So it is possible that embryonic exposure to Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling primes the embryonic cells for differentiation via both positive induction and lack of Sox9 expression. This ultimately results in diminished long-term potential of the HFSCs."

Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is necessary for HF initiation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andl et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ito et al., 2007</a>). Early placode cells are Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal responsive cells, and they generate all of the cells in adult HFs. At the hair peg stage, a localized Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling free zone emerges in upper HF. Progenitor cells residing in this embryonic niche position stop further development and become HFSCs at the end of organogenesis. These established HFSC precursor cells are not just remnants of embryonic progenitor cells, because they gain the expression of adult HFSC markers including <i>Nfatc1</i>. Embryonic cells residing in this Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling free zone, together with a few other cells located below them that have active Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, give rise to the adult HFSC pool. However, only the HFSCs derived from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling negative precursor cells have long-term self-renewal ability and can continuously support regeneration. The small portion of HFSCs that are derived from embryonic cells with active Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling are highly prone to differentiation as the hair cycle progresses and are soon exhausted after regeneration. So, in embryos, the attenuation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling not only defines the adult niche position and HFSC fate, but also has a long lasting effect on the subsequent fate choice and long-term potential of cells in adults."

It has been reported previously that <i>Sox9</i> expression is induced by Shh signaling (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vidal et al., 2005</a>). Given that we observed extended activity of Shh signaling throughout follicle epithelial cells and observed only localized activity of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in lower follicle cells, we can explain the mutually exclusive pattern of <i>Sox9+</i> and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling responsive cells. As development proceeds, the Sox9 expression pattern continues to expand and become wider than the actual future bulge region; for example, Sox9 is expressed in most of the ORS cells. So, following the emergence of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling free zone in the hair peg, there are probably other mechanisms that help maintain the restricted niche position. One observation further supporting this hypothesis is that, once initiated in hair peg, the expression of <i>Nfatc1</i> is restricted to the upper HF where the future sebaceous gland and bulge will be; <i>Nfatc1</i> expression does not expand to the broader ORS like <i>Sox9</i> expression does. Nfatc1 was reported to be a target of BMP signaling in adult HFs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Horsley et al., 2008</a>). However, we did not observe active BMP signaling at the hair peg niche location using a BMP reporter, a result similar to a published staining pattern of pSMAD1/5 in developing HFs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kandyba et al., 2014</a>). So, it remains to be determined which, if any, other mechanisms lead to the maintenance of a more restricted niche region that is reflected by the localized expression of stem cell markers."

We observed increased expression of Wnt inhibitors such as <i>SFRP</i>s in <i>Nfatc1+</i> hair peg cells as compared to <i>Shh+</i> hair peg cells. However, given that HFSC precursor cells can be replaced by embryonic cells occupying the same hair peg niche position, it is unlikely that Wnt inhibitors expressed by the precursor cells themselves are the main causes of attenuated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in that position. Our RNA seq analysis revealed enrichment of <i>Wnt</i> and <i>Dkk</i> expression in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal positive <i>Shh+</i> hair peg cells as compared to <i>Nfatc1+</i> hair peg cells. We hypothesize that the combination of the lack of Wnt ligands, which are short-range signal molecules, and the presence of Wnt inhibitors such as DKK4, which are long-range signal molecules, at the embryonic niche location is the main reason contributes to the emergence of a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling free zone in upper hair peg. A similar model has been used to explain HF density determination and epidermal SC regulation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sick et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lim et al., 2013</a>).

They used multiple transgenic mice to trace cell lineage and found that Shh-expressing cells contribute to most of the HFSC, <i>Nfatc1</i>-expressing cells contribute to SG and upper bulge cells, and Lgr5-expressing cells contribute to lower bulge and SHG cells. By undertaking RNA-seq and using other transgenic lines, they also identified and demonstrated the attenuated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is required for HFSC specification."

Lineage tracing with <i>Axin2-CreER</i> mice confirmed that while <i>Axin2</i>-expressing cells labeled at the hair placode stage can give rise to HFSCs, induction of Cre activity at the hair peg stage resulted in labeling of only a small percentage of HFSCs. The authors conclude that Wnt signaling attenuates the ability of cells to become HFSCs. In support of this, they demonstrate loss of HFSC markers in hair follicles following mutation of epithelial \u03b2-catenin to a constitutively active form. Conversely, deletion of epithelial \u03b2-catenin in late embryonic life causes expanded expression of the HFSC marker Sox9. While these data are consistent with the authors' hypothesis, it also remains possible that a minority of <i>Axin2</i>-positive (Wnt-responsive) cells, located in the upper follicle at the peg stage, does in fact contribute to HFSC rather than differentiating HF populations, and is distinguished from differentiating cells by lower levels and/or a different context of Wnt signaling. As it isn't clear that Lgr5+ and <i>Axin2+</i> cells represent identical (rather than overlapping) populations, this alternate hypothesis could be tested by determining whether <i>Axin2</i>-lineage traced cells in the bulge compartment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) are maintained and/or expand, or conversely disappear, through successive cycles of hair growth."

In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>: the lineage tracing experiments used the dorsal middle 1/3 section of the tail whole mount for quantification (as explained in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B, C</a>). Although hair follicles in this chosen region all follow the developmental pattern we described, we did observe slight variation in labeling efficiency after one Tamoxifen injection (please see added <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Specifically, hair follicles along the anterior-posterior midline of dorsal tail skin had the highest labeling efficiency compared to hair follicles on the sides. For this reason, we only conducted the ablation experiment in hair follicles along this midline in the chosen region. To illustrate our point please see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>: control hair follicles surrounding the ablated hair follicles have almost all of their bulge cells labeled after just one Tamoxifen injection at E17.5. But as the reviewers pointed out, even in this situation, we still cannot prove that we labeled and then ablated all of the cells that were <i>Nfatc1</i> positive. Therefore, we have modified our conclusions accordingly based on the reviewers\u2019 suggestions. Relevant labeling is also changed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>."

However, in the majority of our repeat experiments, we did successfully ablate all <i>Nfatc1-CreER</i> labeled hair peg cells, which resulted in neither SG nor bulges being labeled at later time points (as indicated by <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E, H</a>). We have changed the representative images in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> to more accurately reflect the results of the majority of the ablation experiments."

Lineage tracing with Axin2-CreER mice confirmed that while Axin2-expressing cells labeled at the hair placode stage can give rise to HFSCs, induction of Cre activity at the hair peg stage resulted in labeling of only a small percentage of HFSCs. The authors conclude that Wnt signaling attenuates the ability of cells to become HFSCs. In support of this, they demonstrate loss of HFSC markers in hair follicles following mutation of epithelial \u03b2-catenin to a constitutively active form. Conversely, deletion of epithelial \u03b2-catenin in late embryonic life causes expanded expression of the HFSC marker Sox9. While these data are consistent with the authors' hypothesis, it also remains possible that a minority of Axin2-positive (Wnt-responsive) cells, located in the upper follicle at the peg stage, does in fact contribute to HFSC rather than differentiating HF populations, and is distinguished from differentiating cells by lower levels and/or a different context of Wnt signaling. As it isn't clear that Lgr5+ and Axin2+ cells represent identical (rather than overlapping) populations, this alternate hypothesis could be tested by determining whether Axin2-lineage traced cells in the bulge compartment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) are maintained and/or expand, or conversely disappear, through successive cycles of hair growth.</i>"

We are also interested in finding out the fate of the <i>Axin2</i> positive cells located in the upper follicle that ended up in the bulge: are they long-term stem cells or not? Since it is not clear that Lgr5+ and <i>Axin2+</i> cell are the same, we followed the fate of <i>Axin2+</i> cells in long term lineage tracing experiments (please see new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). After injecting Tamoxifen once at E17.5 to label <i>Axin2+</i> hair peg cells, we got consistent labeling efficiency of the first telogen bulge (~15%). However, following just two rounds of successive hair cycles, most of the <i>Axin2+</i> cells contributed bulge stem cells disappeared (please see new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B, C</a>). This indicates that although a few Wnt signaling responsive cells in the hair peg participate in bulge formation, they are not long-term stem cells and tend to exhaust after participating in downstream proliferation and differentiation. These results suggest that embryonic exposure to Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling diminishes the long-term potential of adult HFSCs."
