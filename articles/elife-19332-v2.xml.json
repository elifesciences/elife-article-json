The relative recruitment of inhibitory and excitatory neurons within an area controls the gain of neurons for appropriate stimulus coding. We examined how such a balance of inhibition and excitation is differentially recruited across multiple levels of a cortical hierarchy by mapping the locations and strengths of synaptic inputs to pyramidal and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons in feedforward and feedback pathways interconnecting primary (V1) and two higher visual areas. While interareal excitation was stronger in PV than in pyramidal neurons in all layer 2/3 pathways, we observed a gradual scaling down of the inhibition/excitation ratio from the most feedforward to the most feedback pathway. Our results indicate that interareal gain control depends on the hierarchical position of the source and the target, the direction of information flow through the network, and the laminar location of target neurons."

While interareal excitation was stronger in PV than in pyramidal neurons in all layer 2/3 pathways, we observed a gradual scaling down of the inhibition/excitation ratio from the most feedforward to the most feedback pathway. Our results indicate that interareal gain control depends on the hierarchical position of the source and the target, the direction of information flow through the network, and the laminar location of target neurons."

But all of the communication in the hierarchy is excitatory, meaning that a signal from one area activates other areas in the visual cortex. So, how does the brain avoid becoming over-stimulated? The answer is that connections between the areas of the visual cortex also contact inhibitory neurons that suppress brain activity. However, it is not clear how the level of inhibition in different areas of the visual cortex is fine-tuned to avoid over-stimulation while maintaining accurate perception of vision."

The approach involved making particular pathways of neurons sensitive to light, such that they could be activated separately with a laser. Next, D\u2019Souza et al. measured the activity of both inhibitory and excitatory neurons that link the different brain areas. The experiments showed that the inhibitory neurons are more strongly activated in the areas of the brain that are further up the hierarchy. This indicates that our ability to make sense of more complex features of visual signals requires higher levels of inhibitory control. The next step is to examine how the brain activates and controls inhibitory neurons, and how this depends on the situation an animal is in and the task it is performing."

However, the rules by which the inhibition/excitation (I/E) balance changes along processing pathways from early to deep stages of the brain and back are incompletely understood."

We studied the strengths of FF and FB inputs interconnecting mouse V1 with Pyr and PV neurons in the extrastriate area PM (posteromedial) situated high in the hierarchy, and compared the I/E balance with input to and from the hierarchically intermediate area LM (lateromedial). Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings and laser-scanning photostimulation of Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing FF and FB connections in acute cortical slices, we show that the relative strength of excitatory input to Pyr and PV cells is pathway-specific and depends on the position of the source and target areas within the hierarchy. Interareal inputs to PV interneurons in upper layers, but not in lower layers, are stronger than to Pyr cells, and the asymmetry of I/E balance was greater for V1 to PM than for LM to PM connections, suggesting weaker FFI by inputs from hierarchically higher areas. In support of the notion that pathways from sources deeper in the brain, which deliver input that vary over a narrower range than input from the outside world, would require lower levels of inhibitory control, we found that FFI is weaker in FB connections and weakest in FB input to V1, at the bottom of the hierarchy. Our findings therefore suggest that in FF and FB pathways targeting neurons in layer 2/3 (L2/3), excitation is more strongly counterbalanced by inhibition and that the imbalance is gradually rectified according to hierarchical distance from the most feedforward to the most feedback."

To do this we traced the outputs from V1, LM and PM with the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and studied the laminar patterns of axon terminals in each of the visual cortical target areas: V1, LM, POR (postrhinal), AL (anterolateral), P (posterior), LI (laterointermediate), PM, AM (anteromedial), RL (rostrolateral) and A (anterior) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>). Projections were assigned to areas by their locations relative to retrogradely bisbenzimide-labeled callosal landmarks (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>), which we imaged in situ\u00a0before sectioning the brain, and by their relative positions to each other (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Sections were numbered from the posterior pole of cortex so that the callosal landmarks seen in the coronal plane could be matched to specific locations of the in situ pattern. BDA labeled fibers were then superimposed onto the callosal pattern observed in the same section, and projections were assigned to specific areas according to the map by Wang and Burkhalter (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Optical density maps of projections showed striking laminar differences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). Although most projections involved L1-6, inputs from V1 consistently showed dense terminations in L2-4 of each of the higher areas with much sparser projections in L1. In contrast, projections from both LM and PM strongly targeted L1 of V1 while weakly targeting L2-4 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>). The selective targeting of L1 by FB projections is consistent with observations in other species (<a href=\"#bib15\">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rockland and Virga, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Henry et al., 1991</a>). To analyze these patterns quantitatively, we computed the density ratio (DR) of terminations in L2-4 to that in L1 of axons from V1, LM and PM to each of the other nine areas and plotted DRs in a 3 \u00d7 9 matrix (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). We reasoned that FF projections from lower areas would, on average, have a higher DR than FB projections from higher areas. The matrix showed that the average DRs in all targets of V1 were &gt;2.52 \u00b1 0.31, whereas the DRs for projections to V1 were &lt;0.72 \u00b1 0.08 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). Pairwise comparisons of average DRs of projections from each of V1, LM, and PM to the other areas showed significant (p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U test) differences, demonstrating that V1, LM and PM are at distinct hierarchical levels, with LM at the intermediate level between V1 and PM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d,e</a>)."

As a first step in the analysis of the recruitment of interareal inhibition, we first confirmed the role of PV interneurons in inhibiting neighboring Pyr cells. These experiments were performed in area PM, one of the targets of V1, in acute slices from mice in which PV cells expressed tdTomato (tdT) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). The axonal projections from V1 to PM were labeled by anterograde tracing with adeno associated virus (AAV) expressing a ChR2-Venus fusion protein (<a href=\"#bib44\">Petreanu et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013f</a>). PM is the posterior projection zone medial to the densely type 2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2)-expressing area V1 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ji et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1d,e</a>).

We performed paired recordings to examine whether increasing the excitation of PV cells results in stronger inhibition of neighboring synaptically connected Pyr cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2c</a>). To do this, we evoked action potentials by injecting current steps (100, 200, 300, and 400\u2009pA; 50 ms; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2c\u2013f</a>) into PV cells and recorded inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in connected Pyr cells. Similar to recordings in other cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pfeffer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Packer and Yuste, 2011</a>) we found a high connection probability. Recordings from PV and Pyr neurons within ~100 \u00b5m of each other resulted in 11/13 (84.6%) and 7/15 (46.6%) synaptically connected pairs in L2/3 and L5, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2g</a>). In both layers, increasing the firing of PV cells resulted in larger IPSCs in Pyr cells (n = 11 pairs in L2/3, 7 pairs in L5; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2d\u2013f</a>). The increase in inhibition was due to both, the increased probability of PV cells to reach spike threshold, as well as increased spiking. These findings reveal a local subnetwork that is likely tapped by interareal connections for FFI of Pyr cells in target areas."

We performed subcellular ChR2-assisted circuit mapping (sCRACM) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Petreanu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mao et al., 2011</a>) in acute slices of visual cortex to measure the input strength and the\u00a0laminar location of interareal connections to PV and Pyr cells in different pathways. To study connections in the FF<sub>V1\u2192PM</sub> pathway, we expressed ChR2-Venus in axons projecting from V1 to PM, and recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from PV and Pyr cells centered at the peak of the PM projection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Photostimulation of ChR2-expressing axon terminals was achieved by a 473 nm laser delivered one spot at a time in a grid pattern separated by 75 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). Recordings were performed in the presence of 1 \u00b5m TTX (tetrodotoxin) and 50 \u00b5m 4-AP (4-aminopyridine) in the bath to block polysynaptic currents and repolarization of axon terminals, respectively. Resulting EPSCs were measured by whole cell patch clamp recordings from PV and Pyr neurons voltage-clamped at \u221270 mV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>).

To illustrate the relative excitation of PV and Pyr cells, we plotted the total EPSC in each PV cell against the total EPSC in its Pyr neighbor, and measured the mean slope for all such pairs in this pathway (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>). We also computed the mean slope after normalizing the EPSC to the mean cell conductance to control for cell size.

The values are percentages in each row of the total EPSC in the respective cell type. Consistent with the distribution of projections (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) the proportion of inputs to L1, relative to total EPSCs, was larger in the FB<sub>PM\u2192 V1</sub> pathway than in the FF<sub>V1\u2192PM</sub> pathway (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3i</a>; p&lt;0.01 for both PV and Pyr cells).

We addressed this question with sCRACM experiments in L2/3 of FF<sub>LM\u2192PM</sub> and FB<sub>PM\u2192LM</sub> pathways (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Similar to FF and FB pathways between V1 and PM, EPSCs were larger in PV cells than in Pyr cells in both pathways (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013f</a>). In the FF<sub>LM\u2192PM</sub> pathway, the mean total current in PV cells was 3.62 \u00b1 0.75-fold larger than in neighboring Pyr cells (n = 15 pairs, p&lt;0.02; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c,g</a>).

The results in L2/3 support the notion that in FF and FB pathways, excitation is more strongly counterbalanced by inhibition and that the imbalance is gradually rectified according to hierarchical distance from the most FF to the most FB (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4j</a>). The results further suggest that the hierarchical distance rule of normalization is independent of the absolute magnitude of EPSCs across the hierarchy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2a\u2013c</a>). Our findings argue that excitation ascending across multiple hierarchical levels is gradually adjusted to keep the dynamic range of L2/3 Pyr cell firing constant and compensate for the increased density of synaptic input to Pyr cells in higher cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib14\">Elston, 2003</a>). Strong activation of PV neurons may narrow the window for effective excitation and result in high frequency gamma-band synchronization of activity found in FF signaling (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gabernet et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cardin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bastos et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, in FB pathways excitation is weakly counterbalanced by inhibition, which may broaden the window for synaptic integration and result in slower synchronization frequencies found in FB communications (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bastos et al., 2015</a>). Thus, variation in I/E balance, through the differential recruitment of PV and Pyr neurons in different cortical pathways, is a key feature of distributed hierarchical processing."

However, the exact pattern of termination of FF and FB axonal projections in the target area appears to vary between species, particularly in the termination patterns of FF pathways in layers 2, 3 and 4 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Price and Zumbroich, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1990</a>). Despite these differences, a consistent observation among different species is a tendency for FF projections to avoid L1 and the selective targeting of L1 by FB pathways (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rockland and Virga, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Henry et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cauller, 1995</a>). We therefore used the average DR of axonal terminations in L2-4 to those in L1 to classify pathways on a sliding scale as being FF or FB. In this reference frame, V1, LM and PM constitute a clear hierarchy, which broadly matches that of rat visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</a>) and is consistent with the increasing size of receptive fields (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>). The hierarchical ordering of V1, LM and PM based on average DRs is consistent with the ordering based on the difference of DRs between reciprocally connected pairs. This is notable because differences in the laminar patterns of reciprocal projections between two areas have traditionally been used to arrange areas in a hierarchy (<a href=\"#bib15\">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</a>). While our method of averaging DRs provides a hierarchy based on how individual visual areas project to every other area within the network, it is conceivable that such a hierarchical arrangement may not be consistent with defining pathways between every reciprocally connected pair of areas as being FF or FB by comparing the DRs of projections to each other. The absolute value of the difference between DRs of reciprocally connected areal pairs therefore remains an open issue for defining hierarchical distance and designating connections as FF, FB, or lateral (<a href=\"#bib15\">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</a>)."

                        "text": "Cortical Pyr cells typically receive thousands of synaptic contacts, raising the question of how these neurons successfully generate graded spike outputs, without saturating their spike output, in response to varying levels of excitatory input (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>). This problem is compounded by the need for deeper parts of the brain, which are further separated from the outside world than lower areas, to respond robustly and appropriately to sensory input varying in intensity over several orders of magnitude. Pertinently, Pyr cells in higher areas have been shown to have a higher density of dendritic spines than those in lower areas in both primates (<a href=\"#bib14\">Elston, 2003</a>) and rodents (<a href=\"#bib12\">Elston et al., 2006</a>), indicating that Pyr neurons in higher areas must integrate a larger number of excitatory inputs. To maintain a wide dynamic range over which Pyr cells can signal, inhibitory neurons have been proposed to be critical (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Pouille et al., 2009</a>). In particular, PV neurons normalize cortical activity by inhibiting Pyr cells by a level that is proportional to the latter\u2019s excitation, thus controlling their gain (<a href=\"#bib2\">Atallah et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wilson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Xue et al., 2014</a>). Because they are strongly targeted by interareal inputs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1999</a>), PV cells are also ideally suited to mediate long-range FFI between areas. Such an interareal inhibitory circuit would make Pyr cells coincidence-detectors (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gabernet et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pouille and Scanziani, 2001</a>), leading to a reduction of noise levels and the preservation of temporal precision in the target area (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bruno, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zhu et al., 2015</a>). Coincidence-detection has also been proposed to help achieve a wide dynamic range by allowing only a fraction of excitatory inputs to summate and evoke a spike response (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>). Our observation that L2/3 PV cells are recruited most strongly by pathways transmitting signals from V1 to higher cortical areas imply that signals sent to deeper parts of the brain from more peripheral areas are more potently controlled by inhibition than pathways originating in higher areas. Such a high level of inhibition may be crucial in order for Pyr cells to efficiently integrate excitatory input from a large number of areas. On the other hand, lower I/E levels in FB pathways would broaden the 'window of opportunity' for spikes to be integrated and trigger an output in the postsynaptic cell (<a href=\"#bib29\">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</a>), suggesting that FB signals originating in association cortex require less gain control than FF signals. Rather, by broadly modulating the excitability of neurons in lower areas (such as by targeting the primary dendrites of Pyr cells in L1/2), FB pathways are well-placed to prime Pyr cells to selectively respond to FF input in a context-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib36\">Larkum, 2013</a>)."

This provides a putative mechanism for the previously observed sparse coding in L2/3 Pyr cells and dense excitation in intrinsically burst-spiking L5 Pyr cells, allowing for distinct computational strategies within individual neurons depending on their postsynaptic targets (<a href=\"#bib25\">Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hefti and Smith, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schubert et al., 2007</a>). The laminar difference may indicate that, similar to thalamocortical input (<a href=\"#bib8\">Constantinople and Bruno, 2013</a>), interareal inputs to L5 are driving Pyr cells. This may enable interareal communication through cortico-thalamo-cortical loops (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guillery and Sherman, 2002</a>) as well as with subcortical motor targets, thereby linking perception and action (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2015</a>)."

For instance, neocortical GABAergic interneurons that express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are thought to be an important target of long-range and neuromodulatory inputs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Reimer et al., 2014</a>), and in turn, primarily inhibit other interneurons leading to disinhibition of cortical Pyr cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pfeffer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Karnani et al., 2016</a>). Somatostatin (SOM)-expressing interneurons, which include Martinotti cells, make extensive inhibitory contacts with local Pyr cells, and can consequently mediate disynaptic inhibition between neighboring Pyr cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fino and Yuste, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</a>). SOM neurons have also been shown to provide inhibitory inputs to other interneurons, including PV cells, suggesting a role in the disinhibition of Pyr cells as well (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pfeffer et al., 2013</a>). A perhaps surprising source of inhibition and disinhibition is glutamate. By activating pre- and postsynaptic metabotropic receptors in various neocortical circuits, glutamate release can induce suppression of GABA release and inhibition of L4 neurons, respectively (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lee and Sherman, 2009</a>). Thus, multiple, partially overlapping (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gonchar et al., 2007</a>) sources of inhibition may be differentially recruited depending on context, providing a multilayered control of cortical function (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pakan et al., 2016</a>)."

For subcellular, optogenetic mapping experiments, 1 \u00b5M TTX and 100 \u00b5M 4-AP were added to the bath in order to block action potentials (and therefore polysynaptic excitation) and fast repolarizing potassium currents. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed with borosilicate pipettes (4\u20136 M\u03a9 resistance). The pipette solution contained (in mM) 128 potassium gluconate, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.4 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 10 sodium phosphocreatine, 3 sodium L-ascorbate, and 3 mg/ml biocytin. The pH was adjusted to 7.2\u20137.3, and osmolarity to 290 mOsm. Fluorescence of ChR2/Venus-expressing fibers and tdT-expressing PV neurons was imaged with a CCD camera (Retiga 2000DC, QImaging). Pyr and PV neurons lying within maximal levels of ChR2/Venus-expressing axonal projections were selected for recordings. PV neurons were identified by tdT expression. For sCRACM experiments (see below), neurons were voltage clamped at \u221270 mV. All voltage-clamp and current-clamp experiments were performed using the Ephus software (<a href=\"#bib57\">Suter et al., 2010</a>) (Vidrio Technologies), an Axopatch 700B amplifier (Molecular devices), and a data acquisition (DAQ) device (NI USB-6259, National Instruments Corp., Austin, TX)."

The grid was aligned such that the longer axis was perpendicular to the pial surface and stimulated spots in all six layers. The position of the laser beam was controlled by galvanometer scanners (Cambridge Scanning), and the duration of stimulation (1 ms) was controlled by a shutter (LS6, Uniblitz). The laser beam (~20 \u00b5m at half maximal intensity) passed through a Pockels cell (ConOptics) and an air objective (4x PlanApo). Because the expression level of ChR2-Venus in interareal axons varied across slices and animals, the laser power was adjusted in every slice so that the largest EPSC<sub>sCRACM</sub> (EPSC recorded under sCRACM conditions) in a neuron did not increase upon increasing laser intensity. Importantly, the laser power was constant for all recordings made in the same slice, in order to compare EPSCs<sub>sCRACM</sub> between neighboring neurons. The laser power measured at the image plane was 0.7\u20131 mW/cm (2). Photostimulation was repeated three to five times for each neuron. The shutter timing and the position of galvanometer mirrors was controlled by Ephus (<a href=\"#bib57\">Suter et al., 2010</a>)."

Projections were assigned to areas by their location relative to retrogradely bisbenzimide-labeled callosal landmarks (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>) and by their relative positions to each other. Callosal landmarks were imaged in situ\u00a0before sectioning the brain.

Individual pixel values for each position of the 8 \u00d7\u00a016 photostimulus grid was calculated as the average EPSC value within 75 ms after photostimulation, and expressed in pA. These calculations were done by custom-written MATLAB scripts. EPSCs at each location of the grid were averaged over three to five repetitions of photostimulation to generate sCRACM maps for each neuron. To compare the total interareal input to pairs of PV and Pyr neurons in the target area, we summed the pixel values for each cell, and compared the total EPSC value of PV and Pyr neurons lying within ~100 \u00b5m of each other, either in L2/3 or in L5. For comparison of mean EPSCs per stimulation point (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we averaged pixel values with significant responses (&gt;4 times standard deviation of baseline) for each cell. For statistical analysis of differences of interareal input to PV and Pyr cells for a particular pathway, we generated scatter plots (for example, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>) in which each data point plotted the total EPSC<sub>sCRACM</sub> from a PV neuron (vertical axis) against the total EPSC<sub>sCRACM</sub> from its Pyr neighbor (horizontal axis). The solid black line in such a scatter plot was generated by connecting the origin (0, 0) to the geometric mean of all EPSC<sub>PV</sub>/EPSC<sub>Pyr</sub> ratios for the respective pathway. The solid blue line was plotted in a similar fashion, but after normalization to the average cell conductance. The non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparing total EPSCs between cell types within pairs. For average heat maps of multiple PV or Pyr neurons, we used a smoothening function in MATLAB that interpolates EPSC values between pixels."
