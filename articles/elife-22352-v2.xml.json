Variable ion channel compositions can produce similar neuronal physiologies across animals. Less is known regarding the morphological precision required to produce reliable neuronal physiology. Theoretical studies suggest that moraphology is tightly tuned to minimize wiring and conduction delay of synaptic events. We utilize high-resolution confocal microscopy and custom computational tools to characterize the morphologies of four neuron types in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab <i>Cancer borealis</i>. Macroscopic branching patterns and fine cable properties are variable within and across neuron types. We compare these neuronal structures to synthetic minimal spanning neurite trees constrained by a wiring cost equation and find that STG neurons do not adhere to prevailing hypotheses regarding wiring optimization principles. In this highly modulated and oscillating circuit, neuronal structures appear to be governed by a space-filling mechanism that outweighs the cost of inefficient wiring."

Variable ion channel compositions can produce similar neuronal physiologies across animals. Less is known regarding the morphological precision required to produce reliable neuronal physiology. Theoretical studies suggest that moraphology is tightly tuned to minimize wiring and conduction delay of synaptic events. We utilize high-resolution confocal microscopy and custom computational tools to characterize the morphologies of four neuron types in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab <i>Cancer borealis</i>. Macroscopic branching patterns and fine cable properties are variable within and across neuron types. We compare these neuronal structures to synthetic minimal spanning neurite trees constrained by a wiring cost equation and find that STG neurons do not adhere to prevailing hypotheses regarding wiring optimization principles. In this highly modulated and oscillating circuit, neuronal structures appear to be governed by a space-filling mechanism that outweighs the cost of inefficient wiring."

Thus, the slow voltage events arising from graded synaptic transmission undergo minimal electrotonic decrement across the neuronal structure. Such electrotonic structures could feasibly mask animal-to-animal variability in neuronal morphology within identified STG neuron types. Additionally, given their compact electrotonic structures, it is plausible that developmental growth of STG neurons may not be constrained by wiring optimization rules, but perhaps other rules that speak to their role in this highly\u00a0modulated, oscillating circuit. In the present study, we quantitatively characterize the morphology of four STG neuron types across several animals. Then, we investigate whether these identified neurons adhere to prevailing wiring optimization principles."

In this approach, concentric circles are overlaid on the image of a neuronal structure. Neurite density is characterized by counting the number of neurite intersections with increasing radius from the centroid, which is typically aligned with the neuronal soma (<a href=\"#bib81\">Sholl, 1953</a>). This can be extended to three dimensions by using spheres instead of circles. Because STG neurons are unipolar rather than somato-centric, we adapted the three-dimensional Sholl analysis by linearizing the neurites and computing Sholl intersections for path length relative to the soma, rather than keeping the neurons in their innate three-dimensional conformation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These data are shown in the violin plots in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>. Because somata are located at varying distances from the neuropil, the Sholl counts at each distance are normalized (described in Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Across and within cell types, there are no apparent trends in this characterization of macroscopic branching patterns. It is interesting to note, however, that some distributions are multi-modal, suggesting that there is more branching at certain distances from the soma, within each neuron. For example, the fourth,\u00a0right-most\u00a0LG neuron (blue), has at least three distinct peaks in its distribution. In contrast, the first,\u00a0left-most LG neuron appears to have primarily one broad peak in its distribution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

The skeletal reconstruction of each neuron is composed of points in the x, y, and z dimensions. For each neuron, the probability distribution function of these points was determined with Gaussian kernel density estimation. The color map represents these probabilities (between 0 and 1), which are scaled within each neuron. Based on these graphical representations, there appears to be no obvious patterning in neurite arborizations within each neuron type. Although GM neurons appear to have distinct regions of high neurite density, PD neurons are more uniformly distributed about the neuropil."

In each neuron, we compared the lengths of all soma-to-tip neurite paths to their minimal Euclidean distances. We measured this in terms of tortuosity (<a href=\"#bib89\">Wen and Chklovskii, 2008</a>), which is defined as the actual neurite path length divided by the Euclidean distance (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). A tortuosity of 1 is indicative of an efficient, minimal path length. A tortuosity greater than one is suggestive of a less efficient, winding path from soma to tip. Across all cell types, tortuosity distributions across all soma-to-tip neurite paths spanned beyond values of 3 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Pooled mean tortuosities within each cell type were uniformly greater than 1, and were: 3.8 (median: 2.6), 4.7 (median: 2.9), 3.2 (median: 2.3), and 2.7 (median: 2.2) for GM, LG, LP, and PD, respectively (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Thus, by this metric, STG neurite paths are measurably longer than the optimal Euclidean length, given their terminal destinations. Analysis across cell types revealed no significant differences in mean tortuosities (ANOVA; [F(3,12): 1.2, p=0.3509]; Tukey HSD)."

Lower <i>bf</i> values result in MSTs with minimal total cable length at the expense of longer root-to-tip path lengths. Low-<i>bf</i> structures are consistent with relatively electrotonically compact neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cuntz et al., 2010</a>). Greater <i>bf</i> values result in lower root-to-tip path lengths at the expense of greater total cable length. High<i>-bf</i> structures are consistent with electrotonically compartmentalized neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cuntz et al., 2010</a>). It is qualitatively evident that the MSTs are not exact representations of the actual LP neuronal structure. However, if the synthetic MSTs recapitulate structural features of the actual STG, this would suggest that wiring cost is an important constraint in STG neuronal morphology. Furthermore, should a given <i>bf</i> value generate neurite trees consistent with the actual neurite trees, the <i>bf</i> value will be suggestive of the actual neuron\u2019s electrotonic structure."

We generated minimal spanning neurite trees with <i>bf</i> values between 0.1\u00a0and\u00a00.6 for each of the 16 STG neurons (simulation parameters shown in <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). We then compared a number of structural features across the synthetic MSTs and actual neuronal structures. These measures include neurite lengths, tortuosities, and total wiring as described previously. We also considered branch order distributions, which provide a quantitative characterization of neuritic arborizations (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>, <a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig11s4\">4</a>). In brief, branch order is a property of each branch point in the neuronal structure. It is equivalent to the number of branch points between the first branch point (relative to the soma, which has a branch order of 0), and a given branch point. The branch order distributions of many of the actual STG neurons (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>, in black) are skewed right, with branch orders of 100 or greater, suggesting that neurite paths may branch more than 100 times before terminating. In this way, the branch order distributions reflect the complex and highly\u00a0branched nature STG neurons."

The geometrical properties of any neurite path: its length, diameter, taper, and branch points, shape current flow. In this way, whether voltage events arising at disparate sites across a dendritic tree are integrated is highly dependent on neuronal geometry (<a href=\"#bib73\">Rall, 1977</a>).

Therefore, it is not surprising that the 16 neurons in this study are more expansive and have measurably greater neurite lengths than previously reported. This is likely due to visualization of smaller processes that may have been lost in these earlier studies. Yet, many of the take-home messages are consistent with these earlier studies: soma positions of given neuron types vary across animals (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bucher et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Thuma et al., 2009</a>), and most neuron types are indistinguishable by soma position, maximum branch order, and total cable lengths (<a href=\"#bib84\">Thuma et al., 2009</a>).

Further, the connections between particular pairs of neurons are sparsely distributed over multiple neurites of their neurite trees (<a href=\"#bib48\">King, 1976a</a>).

Such distribution of synaptic connections likely contributes to the masking of morphological variability at the physiological level. Slow postsynaptic voltage events arising across sparsely distributed sites may influence transmission globally or locally. Sparse, slow voltage events, resilient to electrotonic decrement, may have the capacity to sum and alter the net physiology of the neuron. Alternatively, small postsynaptic potentials may locally influence transmission at nearby postsynaptic sites on the same branch, influencing particular synaptic connections in the circuit.

Yet, a recent study demonstrated a great deal of variability in dendritic morphology within one class of mammalian neocortical pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hamada et al., 2016</a>). Interestingly, the distance between the soma and spike initiation zone co-varies with and compensates for variability in the dendritic tree. In this case, the pyramidal neuron achieves its target physiological properties by tuning ion channel distributions to the neuron\u2019s geometry."

Consideration of the spatial relationships between subtrees within individual STG\u00a0neurons suggests that subtrees grow to fill and tile distinct spatial fields in the neuropil. We speculate that this may be for the purpose of maximizing surface area for the reception of the numerous neuromodulatory substances that are diffusely released in the hemolymph and by the descending inputs of the stomatogastric nerve (<a href=\"#bib54\">Marder and Bucher, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blitz and Nusbaum, 2011</a>). Thus, in development, space-filling of the neuropil may outweigh the wiring economy that might be expected if decrement of synaptic events were critical to circuit function."

Because STG somata are segregated from the neuropil and the neurite field, this approach was not logically consistent with the goal of Sholl analyses. Instead, we calculated an equivalent somatofugal Sholl distance by creating linearly\u00a0spaced distances ranging from zero to the maximum path length and asked for each pair of nodes whether the traversing line crossed this distance. In this way, path lengths are the distances being measured and branching patterns can be elucidated. Equivalently, one could re-plot an STG neuron with the soma at the center of a 2D Sholl graph with filaments that conserve segment length branching out radially from the soma."

Geometry objects were generated from the <i>hoc</i> skeletons for each neuron using Python. A Gaussian kernel density estimation (from the SciPy statistics module, utilizing Scott\u2019s Rule for bandwidth selection) was used to generate a probability distribution function for all points in the x and y dimensions composing each neuron\u2019s geometry object. This resulted in a probability value (between 0 and 1) for each point that indicates its relative number of nearest neighbors. For each neuron, the geometry object points were plotted in the x-y plane and colored by the points\u2019 probabilities. The color map was scaled to the range of probabilities within each neuron. In this way, the spatial density plots can be interpreted as visualizations of neurite density.

Subtrees were defined by: (1) having a root segment that departed from the primary neurite and (2) containing at least one terminating tip segment. The terminating tips of a subtree form a tip cluster. The center of mass of a subtree was calculated as the mean x-y-z coordinates of its terminating tips. The radius of a subtree tip cluster was calculated as the mean distance from the center of mass coordinates to each tip\u2019s coordinates. We used a design-based inference sampling strategy (<a href=\"#bib27\">Geuna, 2000</a>) to randomly assign tips to any cluster, while maintaining the number of tips per cluster. The reassigned tips for a given subtree could originate from any subtree, consistent with an earlier study (<a href=\"#bib91\">Wilensky et al., 2003</a>). We performed this randomization between 100 and 2000 times, depending on the number of possible tip configurations and subtrees. The subtree tip cluster radii and the number of overlapping subtree tip clusters from the randomized subtrees were compared to those of the original neuronal structure."

This MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) toolbox is freely available with an extensive user\u2019s manual online: <a href=\"http://www.treestoolbox.org.\">www.treestoolbox.org.</a> The minimal spanning neurite trees were generated with similar methods as described in <a href=\"#bib20\">Cuntz et al. (2010)</a>. For each of the 16 STG neurons, synthetic trees were constructed to connect the root node (defined by the coordinates of the first branch point relative to the soma, in the actual neuronal structure) to the target\u00a0nodes. Target\u00a0nodes were randomly generated from points uniformly distributed in an elliptical volume approximating the space occupied by the actual neuronal structure. The number of target nodes was tuned such that branch point numbers of the MSTs were\u00a0within 0\u201320% of the actual STG neuron. The lengths and paths of neurite segments connecting these nodes were constrained by the simple wiring cost equation: total cost = wiring cost + <i>bf</i> * path length cost (as described in <a href=\"#bib20\">Cuntz et al., 2010</a>). The balancing factor (bf) is the only variable parameter in this model and weighs the cost of minimizing total cable length versus minimizing soma-to-tip path lengths. Seven corresponding synthetic trees were generated for each of the 16 STG neurons in the present study with a range of balancing factor values between 0.1 and 0.6 (at increments of bf\u00a0=\u00a00.1). Total wiring, branch point numbers, branch order distributions, neurite length distributions, and tortuosity distributions of the synthetic trees were plotted in comparison to those of the actual skeletal structures using MATLAB. This range of bf values was chosen because the resulting MSTs recapitulated realistic ranges in these morphological features that spanned those of the actual neurons.

Though the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of crabs is not analogous to brain structures that have given rise to the prevailing concepts it does provide a stark contrast to this view. The spatial relationships between subtrees within individual neurons suggests that STG neurons grow to fill and tile distinct spatial fields in the neuropil. The authors then argue that because in the STG synaptic transmission is predominantly graded and slow, \"in development, space-filling of the neuropil may outweigh the wiring economy that might be expected if decrement of synaptic events were critical to circuit function.\" They also argue that tiling the entire neuropil is advantageous for reception of paracrine modulatory input. The data presented is very high resolution whole mount dye fills of 4 types of STG neurons, two unique types that are singularly represented and two types that are represented by more than one copy. The analysis is highly quantitative and thoroughly analyzed statistically with appropriate techniques. The figures are not only clear but esthetically pleasing."

There is no mention of this ambiguity or discussion concerning how inputs and outputs overlap or are segregated; the relevant papers are cited without mention of this aspect of their findings. Instead the Introduction and Discussion focus on modulatory inputs when there is even less data as to where the relevant receptors occur. It would be an interesting study to prove that input fields and output fields were separate or overlapping and relate that to the neuritic fields described, but here the issues must be aired, at least.

I was excited to find a system in which the considerations that we have found to be true for so many other systems (fly tangential cells, cortical pyramidal cells of many different types, cerebellar Purkinje cells, many different hippocampal cells, starburst amacrine cells in the retina, periglomerular neurons in the olfactory bulb etc., in fact, even all of NeuroMorpho.Org was subjected to the analysis in Cuntz et al. 2012 PNAS) would not hold."

Unfortunately, in most cases the locations of those carrier synapses are unknown (except for example for data from Adi Mizrahi on periglomerular neurons from the olfactory bulb that we used in Cuntz et al., 2012 PNAS). Therefore, one has to make some assumptions about which target locations should be connected by the MST. The authors here decided to take the termination points of the dendrites that they reconstructed as target points for the minimum spanning tree. This choice is not discussed. Connecting N termination points with an MST (constrained to be binary) will lead to termination points, branch points and continuation points (with one daughter). The resulting trees therefore will automatically have less termination points than the original trees. In binary trees (which <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> shows the STG neurons mostly are), the number of branch points is equal to the number of termination points minus 1. In MSTs on N randomly distributed points with a <i>bf</i> = 0 we have shown previously that the distributed points divide into N/4 termination points, N/4 branch points and N/2 continuation points approximately (Cuntz et al., 2012 PNAS). This explains directly the findings in the present manuscript: Number of branches, total length, and average branch order are all dramatically underestimated here by the fact that only 25% of the correct number of target points were distributed (assuming <i>bf</i>=0, but otherwise certainly never more than about 40%)."

In the case of the periglomerular neurons in (Cuntz et al., 2012 PNAS) we found that the number of branch points was indeed in numbers about 25% of the number of synapses marked by PSD95-GFP."

After correcting this, the results will look very differently and maybe will show that the crab STG neurons also optimise wiring as so many others do (However analysis in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> indeed show a much larger tortuosity than in most other dendrites that I have looked at).

They show very nicely that crab stomatogastric ganglion neurites do not obey a standard wiring length optimality rule, but do not offer a positive alternative. In the last few sentences of the Discussion, they speculate that STG neurons maximize surface area in order to sample the \"cocktail of peptides and amines\" being released into this ganglion. This seems like a reasonably straightforward hypothesis to test using the existing data and analytical toolset the authors have marshalled. Specifically, does a geometrical model maximizing surface area allow for a better fit to the data than the Cuntz et al. spanning tree-based model? This type of analysis could be done in a follow-up paper, but it also seems within the authors' grasp here. (And, if a model maximizing surface area fits the observed arbors very closely, can the observed arbors really be considered 'sloppy'?)"

Van Essen's argument about cortical folding (Nature. 1997 Jan 23;385(6614):313-8) is an example at the extreme of this idea. At smaller length scales, for smaller numbers of neurons, wiring frequently looks highly suboptimal. For example, in the cat, retinogeniculate axons frequently make many branches which each independently target the same volume of LGN (Sur et al., J Neurophysiol. 1987 Jul;58(1):1-32), and in the mouse, motor neurons take extremely tortuous paths to cover the end plate (Lu et al., PLoS Biol. 2009 Feb 10;7(2):e32. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000032).

To address this issue, we generated carrier points from uniformly distributed points that spanned the elliptical volume of the actual STG neuron. We tuned the number of carrier points such that the branch point numbers of the resulting MSTs were within range of the actual STG neurons\u2019 branch point numbers (all within 20%, but often within 5%). This revised simulation yielded MSTs with structural features (total wiring, branch order distributions, neurite length distributions, and tortuosity distributions) with realistic ranges, consistent with those observed in STG neurons. However, as is clear in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a> and the supplements to <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>, no one <i>bf</i> comprehensively recapitulated these structural features of the STG neurons.

There is no mention of this ambiguity or discussion concerning how inputs and outputs overlap or are segregated; the relevant papers are cited without mention of this aspect of their findings. Instead the Introduction and Discussion focus on modulatory inputs when there is even less data as to where the relevant receptors occur. It would be an interesting study to prove that input fields and output fields were separate or overlapping and relate that to the neuritic fields described, but here the issues must be aired, at least. Could this likely overlap of inputs and outputs be as important as graded transmission in determining STG neuronal morphology?</i>"

Unfortunately, in most cases the locations of those carrier synapses are unknown (except for example for data from Adi Mizrahi on periglomerular neurons from the olfactory bulb that we used in Cuntz et al., 2012 PNAS). Therefore, one has to make some assumptions about which target locations should be connected by the MST. The authors here decided to take the termination points of the dendrites that they reconstructed as target points for the minimum spanning tree. This choice is not discussed. Connecting N termination points with an MST (constrained to be binary) will lead to termination points, branch points and continuation points (with one daughter). The resulting trees therefore will automatically have less termination points than the original trees. In binary trees (which <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> shows the STG neurons mostly are), the number of branch points is equal to the number of termination points minus 1. In MSTs on N randomly distributed points with a bf = 0 we have shown previously that the distributed points divide into N/4 termination points, N/4 branch points and N/2 continuation points approximately (Cuntz et al., 2012 PNAS). This explains directly the findings in the present manuscript: Number of branches, total length, and average branch order are all dramatically underestimated here by the fact that only 25% of the correct number of target points were distributed (assuming bf=0, but otherwise certainly never more than about 40%).</i>"

We did re-write parts of the Results and Discussion to better reflect the meaning of these analyses. It remains true that these analyses do, in fact, recapitulate the properties of numerous other neuron types.

In the last few sentences of the Discussion, they speculate that STG neurons maximize surface area in order to sample the \"cocktail of peptides and amines\" being released into this ganglion. This seems like a reasonably straightforward hypothesis to test using the existing data and analytical toolset the authors have marshalled. Specifically, does a geometrical model maximizing surface area allow for a better fit to the data than the Cuntz et al. spanning tree-based model? This type of analysis could be done in a follow-up paper, but it also seems within the authors' grasp here.

Van Essen's argument about cortical folding (Nature. 1997 Jan 23;385(6614):313-8) is an example at the extreme of this idea. At smaller length scales, for smaller numbers of neurons, wiring frequently looks highly suboptimal. For example, in the cat, retinogeniculate axons frequently make many branches which each independently target the same volume of LGN (Sur et al., J Neurophysiol. 1987 Jul;58(1):1-32), and in the mouse, motor neurons take extremely tortuous paths to cover the end plate (Lu et al., PLoS Biol. 2009 Feb 10;7(2):e32. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000032).
