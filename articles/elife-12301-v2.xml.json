The genetic identities of premotoneurons providing behaviorally relevant excitation to any pool of respiratory motoneurons remain unknown. Recently, we established in vitro that Dbx1-derived pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex neurons are critical for rhythm generation and that a subpopulation serves a premotor function (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Here, we further show that a subpopulation of Dbx1-derived intermediate reticular (IRt) neurons are rhythmically active during inspiration and project to the hypoglossal (XII) nucleus that contains motoneurons important for maintaining airway patency. Laser ablation of Dbx1 IRt neurons, 57% of which are glutamatergic, decreased ipsilateral inspiratory motor output without affecting frequency. We conclude that a subset of Dbx1 IRt neurons is a source of premotor excitatory drive, contributing to the inspiratory behavior of XII motoneurons, as well as a key component of the airway control network whose dysfunction contributes to sleep apnea."

The genetic identities of premotoneurons providing behaviorally relevant excitation to any pool of respiratory motoneurons remain unknown. Recently, we established in vitro that Dbx1-derived pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex neurons are critical for rhythm generation and that a subpopulation serves a premotor function (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Here, we further show that a subpopulation of Dbx1-derived intermediate reticular (IRt) neurons are rhythmically active during inspiration and project to the hypoglossal (XII) nucleus that contains motoneurons important for maintaining airway patency. Laser ablation of Dbx1 IRt neurons, 57% of which are glutamatergic, decreased ipsilateral inspiratory motor output without affecting frequency. We conclude that a subset of Dbx1 IRt neurons is a source of premotor excitatory drive, contributing to the inspiratory behavior of XII motoneurons, as well as a key component of the airway control network whose dysfunction contributes to sleep apnea."

Thus, in the unlikely circumstance that we ablated endogenously active inhibitory Dbx1 IRt premotoneurons, it would underestimate rather than contradict our conclusion that Dbx1 IRt premotoneurons provide excitatory drive for inspiratory motor output."

Inspiratory neurons comprise more than 20% of Dbx1 IRt neurons. Ipsilaterally projecting Dbx1 IRt premotoneurons are a significant source of glutamatergic inspiratory drive to XII motoneurons in vitro. Whether they are the sole source is uncertain. Persistence of inspiratory XII nerve activity following laser ablation of Dbx1 IRt neurons might suggest additional non-Dbx1 derived sources of inspiratory premotor drive. However, the ablation-resistant activity could also derive from Dbx1 premotoneurons too deep for laser ablation, or Dbx1-derived neurons that went untargeted due to lack of tdTomato expression (see Methods). The contribution of ipsilaterally projecting Dbx1 IRt premotoneurons to inspiratory drive in vivo is an important question that cannot be extrapolated from in vitro experiments. Portions of the XII premotor network, as well as sources of modulatory drive, are missing from slices, which may make inspiratory XII output more sensitive to the loss of premotoneurons."

Detection and ablation procedures consist of three phases: (1) initialization, (2) target detection, and (3) ablation. The initialization phase defines the domain for detection and ablation, which in this case comprises a region of the IRt, as defined above, that is a 412 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> in the transverse plane and 100 \u00b5m along the rostrocaudal axis; i.e., ablation was limited to neurons within 100 \u00b5m of the slice surface. This spanned the area dorsomedial to nucleus ambiguus and ventrolateral to XII nucleus, which excludes the preB\u00f6tC. During the detection phase, tdTomato emission was detected using a HeNe 543 nm laser at depths &lt;100 \u00b5m, while scripted routines making use of ImageJ functionality were used to differentiate Dbx1 neurons based on threshold-crossing algorithms (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). During the ablation phase, individual Dbx1 IRt neurons were randomly selected from the list of validated targets and scanned over a 10 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> area at the center of the defined cell location by maximum-strength 800-nm Ti:Sapphire laser pulses. The time between ablations was ~30 s, which includes scanning time required for the ablation and for confirmation of the ablation. Lesions were confirmed by optical criteria described elsewhere and confirmed ablations were added to the running tally (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Lesions were performed until the entire target list was exhausted. XII motor output was monitored for 30 min prior to beginning ablations and then throughout the ablations. XII motoneuron axons travel across the slice virtually parallel to the cut surface and then exit the brainstem through the ventral surface in multiple nerve rootlets that span more than 500 \u00b5m rostrocaudally. We record from the XII nerve root closest the targeted slice surface since it is most likely to contain axons of motoneurons that receive input from the surface Dbx1 neurons that we are able to ablate."

Cell capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>, pF) was calculated from the quotient of the time constant and the input resistance. Finally, rheobase (I<sub>rh</sub>, pA) was measured by applying 3-ms depolarizing pulses that were manually adjusted until reaching the minimum pulse magnitude that elicited a single action potential on the termination of the current pulse.

Inspiratory burst latency (drive latency) quantifies the time interval between summating excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the recorded neuron (causing the neuron to depolarize and potentially fire action potentials) and the XII motor output; positive numbers indicate that the Dbx1 neuron depolarized before the onset of the XII root output. Drive latency was measured from the onset of summating EPSPs in the recorded neuron to the maximum slope of the XII burst (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rekling et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Picardo et al., 2013</a>). Drive amplitude was measured as the difference between maximum depolarization and the baseline (baseline defined as the average membrane potential during 250 ms of the interburst interval preceding the burst to be measured), if the depolarizing burst was insufficient to lead to action potentials. If, however, the neuron spiked during the inspiratory drive, the maximum depolarization was estimated based on the shape of the underlying drive potential. Drive potential area was measured as the integral of the burst, which (unlike drive potential amplitude) is a measure insensitive to intraburst spiking. Finally, drive potential duration was measured for both the XII root output and for inspiratory-modulated Dbx1 IRt neurons based on the elapsed time from when XII discharge or the membrane potential exceeded 10% of peak depolarization to the moment XII discharge or membrane potential dropped below 10% of peak depolarization."

The authors show that laser ablation of a set of ~70 Dbx1-tdTomato labeled neurons in the IRt significantly reduces the amplitude of the ipsilateral inspiratory hypoglossal motor output without affecting the frequency of the rhythm, thereby providing functional evidence that at least some of these DBx1 positive cells in this region of brainstem are premotor neurons downstream of the rhythm-generating inspiratory kernel mediating drive to the XII motor neurons. The authors argue that the novelty the present study is establishing the developmental origin (from Dbx1-expressing progenitors) of some identified inspiratory premotoneurons. Together with previous work showing that a subset of Dbx1-derived pre-B\u00f6tC neurons are inspiratory neurons and function in rhythmogenesis, the authors also argue that the potential advance is the demonstration that that these premotor neurons are distinct from the inspiratory rhythm generating neuronal population but are derived from the same progenitors. The responses of the reviewers were generally positive and agree that study is a significant advance of the previous study of Dbx1 derived neurons in pre-B\u00f6tC. The reviewers felt however that the authors' statement of the advance is out of line with what they actually show and that it contains overstatements for which there is no support in the presented data. While the study is technically sound and well performed, the authors need to acknowledge the limitations of their findings. These points are outlined below."
