Tissue-specific expression of accessory (\u03b2) subunits causes these channels to generate currents with distinct properties. In the heart, KCNQ1 voltage-gated potassium channels coassemble with KCNE1 \u03b2-subunits to generate the I<sub>Ks</sub> current (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barhanin et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</a>), an important current for maintenance of stable heart rhythms. KCNE1 significantly modulates the gating, permeation, and pharmacology of KCNQ1 (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wrobel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sun et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott, 2014</a>). These changes are essential for the physiological role of I<sub>Ks</sub> (<a href=\"#bib62\">Silva and Rudy, 2005</a>); however, after 18 years of study, no coherent mechanism explaining how KCNE1 affects KCNQ1 has emerged. Here we provide evidence of such a mechanism, whereby, KCNE1 alters the state-dependent interactions that functionally couple the voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) to the pore."

Tissue-specific expression of accessory (\u03b2) subunits causes these channels to generate currents with distinct properties. In the heart, KCNQ1 voltage-gated potassium channels coassemble with KCNE1 \u03b2-subunits to generate the I<sub>Ks</sub> current (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barhanin et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</a>), an important current for maintenance of stable heart rhythms. KCNE1 significantly modulates the gating, permeation, and pharmacology of KCNQ1 (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wrobel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sun et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott, 2014</a>). These changes are essential for the physiological role of I<sub>Ks</sub> (<a href=\"#bib62\">Silva and Rudy, 2005</a>); however, after 18 years of study, no coherent mechanism explaining how KCNE1 affects KCNQ1 has emerged. Here we provide evidence of such a mechanism, whereby, KCNE1 alters the state-dependent interactions that functionally couple the voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) to the pore."

It had also been assumed that the voltage-sensing domains do not affect the flow of ions once the channel is open. Zaydman et al. have now shown that these assumptions are not valid for a specific voltage-gated potassium channel called KCNQ1. Instead, this ion channel opens when its voltage-sensing domains are either partially or fully activated. Zaydman found that the intermediate-open and activated-open states had different preferences for passing various types of ion; therefore, the gating of the channel and the flow of ions through the open channel are both dependent on the state of the voltage-sensing domains. This is in direct contrast to what had previously been assumed."

Thus, for nearly 20 years it has been debated whether KCNE1 primarily affects the activation of the voltage-sensing domains or the opening of the pore. Zaydman et al. found instead that KCNE1 alters the interactions between the voltage-sensing domains and the pore, which prevented the intermediate-open state and modified the properties of the activated-open state.

These channels consist of four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) surrounding a central pore. In voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, this structure results from the tetrameric assembly of Kv-\u03b1 subunits, each of which contain six transmembrane-spanning segments (S1\u2013S6). S1\u2013S4 of each subunit forms a voltage-sensing domain (VSD), and S5\u2013S6's from all four subunits form the pore. Sensing of membrane voltage occurs within the VSDs, which contain a mobile S4 segment with several highly conserved basic residues. At depolarized voltages, the forces of the membrane electric field on these positively charged residues promotes the outward displacement of S4 toward its activated state (<a href=\"#bib49\">Papazian et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Larsson et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Silva et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wu et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Delemotte et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jensen et al., 2012</a>).

The legacy of the Hogdkin and Huxley model can still be found in the current Kv channel models, which assume that (1) VSD activation and pore opening are two-state (i.e., all or none) processes and (2) gating and permeation are independent so that the VSD conformation changes the probability of pore opening, but does not affect the properties of the open pore. Several recent studies call into question the assumption that VSD activation and pore opening are two-state processes. Computational and experimental studies have demonstrated that VSD activation actually occurs in a series of stepwise transitions due to salt bridge interactions between the basic residues on S4 and acidic residues on S1 and S2, which define resting, intermediate, and activated states (<a href=\"#bib49\">Papazian et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tiwari-Woodruff et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wu et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Delemotte et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jensen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lacroix et al., 2012</a>). With regards to pore opening, recordings of single channel currents from Kv channels revealed multiple open states discernable by their different conductance levels (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chapman et al., 1997</a>), although the identities of these subconductance states remain unclear. In our present study of KCNQ1 (Kv7.1, KvLQT1) channels, we found that both the intermediate and fully-activated states of the VSD yielded robust pore-opening. Remarkably, the intermediate-open and activated-open states had different permeation and pharmacological properties revealing that VSD-pore interactions determine both open probability and open conformation, demonstrating that gating and permeation are not independent."

The importance of this response is highlighted by a large set of loss-of-function mutations of KCNQ1 or KCNE1 that have been associated with Long QT Syndrome and result in an elevated risk of fatal arrhythmias during times of stress (<a href=\"#bib48\">Paavonen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Schwartz et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hedley et al., 2009</a>).

First, we found that VSD activation occurs in two resolvable steps through a stable intermediate state. Second, we observed that the intermediate-state of the VSD is sufficient to promote KCNQ1 channel opening, resulting in both intermediate-open and activated-open states. Third, we observed that the intermediate-open and activated-open states have different permeation and pharmacological properties. With these critical observations, we were able to reexamine how KCNE1 affects KCNQ1. We found that coexpression of KCNE1 prevented the intermediate-open state and changed the properties of the activated-open state. The apparent decoupling of pore opening from the resting to intermediate transition of the VSD suggested that KCNE1 changes how the VSD and pore interact. Consistent with this hypothesis, changing the VSD-pore interactions directly via a single point mutation also prevented the intermediate-open state and modified the properties of the activated-open state. Using a kinetic model, we demonstrated that the effects of KCNE1 on VSD-pore interactions, as suggested by our data, are sufficient to simultaneously explain most of the changes in activation gating without any direct impacts on VSD activation or pore opening. Furthermore, as VSD-pore interactions were found to determine the open-pore properties, the effects of KCNE1 on permeation and pharmacology could also be rationalized. Therefore we conclude that altering VSD-pore interactions is likely the primary mechanism through which KCNE1 modulates KCNQ1."

In our VCF records, a fluorophore attached to the S3\u2013S4 linker of pseudo-WT KCNQ1 channels (with mutations C214A/G219C/C331A) reports on conformational changes associated with VSD activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013H</a>, green), while the ionic currents report the opening of the pore (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013H</a>, black) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Osteen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zaydman et al., 2013</a>).

(<b>B</b>) Averaged (over several trajectories) pore radius vs position along the axis normal to the membrane (Z). (<b>C</b>) Snapshots of the PIP<sub>2</sub> intrasubunit-binding site in the three states. In the resting/closed state, PIP<sub>2</sub> interacts with positive residues of S4 (cyan). When the VSD is intermediate or activated, PIP<sub>2</sub> shifts closer to S6 (yellow) and anchors its positive residues (K354 and K358). (<b>D</b>) Probability of salt bridges formation between positive residues of S6 (K354 and K358) and PIP<sub>2</sub>. The lipid interacts with S6 only when the VSD is intermediate or activated, not when it is resting. Error bars represent SD. K354 and K358 interactions are not statistically different for the E1-R2 and E1-R4 states. <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a> represents the averaged pore radius profiles along the axis normal to the membrane (Z). In the activated/open and intermediate states, the minimal radiuses of the pore at this level are 3.5 \u00b1 0.4 \u00c5 and 2.8 \u00b1 0.6 \u00c5 respectively. For comparison, in the Kv1.2 open state, the corresponding radius (pdb 3LUT [<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2010</a>]) is 4.2 \u00c5, in the Kv1.2/2.1 paddle chimera open state (pdb 2 R9R [<a href=\"#bib36\">Long et al., 2007</a>]) it is 4.2 \u00c5 also, and in the NavMS open state (pdb 3ZJZ [<a href=\"#bib2\">Loussouarn et al., 2003</a>]) it is 2.3 \u00c5. Therefore, the minimal pore radius at the intercellular gate level in the models of the Kv7.1 activated and intermediate states corresponds to the open pore. In the resting/closed state, this radius decreases to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00c5. This is similar to the closed states of KcsA (pdb 1K4C [<a href=\"#bib90\">Zhou et al., 2001</a>]), NavAB (pdb 4EKW [<a href=\"#bib50\">Payandeh et al., 2012</a>]) and NavAP (pdb 4DXW [<a href=\"#bib89\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>]), where these values are 1.1, 1.2 and 0.9 \u00c5 respectively. The activated/open, intermediate and resting/closed states of Kv7.1 differ by their properties as evidenced from the reported experimental data. Taking advantage of our simulations, we attempted to investigate whether the interactions between PIP<sub>2</sub> and positive residues of the Kv7.1 intrasubunit binding site are different. Indeed PIP<sub>2</sub> interacts preferably with the VSD (S4) when the channel is resting/closed or with the pore (S6) when the channel is activated/open (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kasimova et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>, top and bottom panels). In the intermediate state, the lipid forms salt bridges with both S4 (R243) and S6 (K354 and K358) simultaneously (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>, middle panel). Its equilibrium position is also between these in the activated/open and resting/closed states. Interestingly, the probability of interaction between PIP<sub>2</sub> and S6 (K354 and K358) is rather high (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). The average values are slightly higher for the intermediate than for the activated/open states: 40 and 26% for K354, 68 and 42% for K358 respectively. However, this difference is statistically insignificant due to the estimated error bars."

These interactions stabilize discrete resting, intermediate, and activated states. We built homology models of KCNQ1 with the VSDs in states where E1 forms a salt bridge with R228 (R1), R231 (R2), or R237 (R4) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), the three S4 arginines that are known to be critical for voltage-sensing in KCNQ1 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shamgar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Wu et al., 2010b</a>). In KCNQ1 a neutral residue (Q234) is located in the canonical third arginine position (R3) of other Kv channels; therefore, we did not model the E1-R3 state. In Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations, we found that the pore was more dilated when the VSDs were in the E1-R2 or E1-R4 states than in the E1-R1 state (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These simulations suggest that KCNQ1 channels can open when the VSDs assume intermediate or activated states (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). To capture these states experimentally, we engineered pairwise charge reversal mutations to arrest the VSD near the E1-R2 or E1-R4 states (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). As shown previously (<a href=\"#bib79\">Wu et al., 2010a</a>), for KCNQ1 channels, mutating E1 to arginine (E1R) caused a severe loss of current that was partially rescued by a charge reversing (R to E) mutation at the R2 (E1R/R2E) or R4 (E1R/R4E) positions (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). E1R/R2E and E1R/R4E channels were constitutively open (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C,D</a>), suggesting that the VSD was trapped in states where the paired residues interact. When KCNE1 was coexpressed, the E1R/R2E currents were eliminated and the E1R/R4E currents were increased by nearly 10-fold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), suggesting that KCNE1 suppresses the intermediate-open state and potentiates the activated-open state. Importantly, we found that the abundance of E1R/R2E subunits in the cell membrane was similar when expressed alone or coexpressed with KCNE1, indicating that the inhibition of E1R/R2E currents was due to a functional effect on the intermediate-open state, not an effect on surface expression (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>). Altogether, the results in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> are consistent with a model in which the VSD undergoes two sequential transitions, resting-to-intermediate and intermediate-to-activated. The first transition is sufficient for KCNQ1 to open, resulting in both intermediate-open and activated-open states. With KCNE1, the second transition is required for opening because the intermediate-open state is suppressed."

For example, as previously demonstrated by <a href=\"#bib53\">Pusch et al. (2000)</a>, KCNQ1 channels had a higher Rb<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> permeability ratio than KCNQ1+KCNE1 channels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>) and, as reported by Cohen and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2000</a>), KCNQ1 channels were more sensitive than KCNQ1+KCNE1 channels to the inhibitor XE991 when short duration pulses (comparable to the length of the cardiac action potential) were applied (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We used the E1R/R2E and E1R/R4E mutations to examine if VSD conformation affects permeation and pharmacology. Strikingly, E1R/R4E channels had a significantly lower Rb<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> permeability ratio and a significantly lower apparent affinity for XE991 compared to E1R/R2E and WT KCNQ1 channels, which were similar (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). These results reveal that different VSD conformations yield functionally distinct open states. Furthermore, the similar properties of E1R/R2E and WT KCNQ1 suggest that the intermediate-open state is either the most populated or the most conductive open-state for WT KCNQ1 channels, a notion that is further supported by our observation that E1R/R2E currents are 2\u20133 times larger than E1R/R4E currents (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>) despite having similar levels of membrane expression (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). Relative to E1R/R4E alone, coexpression of KCNE1 with E1R/R4E significantly decreased the Rb<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> permeability ratio (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>) and increased the apparent affinity for XE991 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>) indicating that, in addition to eliminating the intermediate-open state, KCNE1 alters the properties of the activated-open state. Of note, we found that E1R/R4E+KCNE1 and WT KCNQ1+KCNE1 channels displayed similar Rb<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> permeability ratios (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and XE991 sensitivities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), further supporting our conclusion from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> that WT KCNQ1+KCNE1 currents are conducted by channels in the activated-open state."

                        "text": "In our previous studies, we have shown that KCNE1 increases the apparent affinity of KCNQ1 for the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2011</a>) and that, in KCNQ1, PIP<sub>2</sub> binding at the VSD-pore interface mediates the VSD-pore interactions that energetically couple VSD activation to pore opening (<a href=\"#bib87\">Zaydman et al., 2013</a>). Taken together these findings suggest that KCNE1 affects the VSD-pore interactions. To test this hypothesis, we studied the impact of changing VSD-pore interactions directly via a point mutation of KCNQ1, F351A. F351 on S6 is highly conserved among Kv channels and participates in interactions with the S4/S5 linker that are known to be critical for VSD-pore interactions and coupling (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tristani-Firouzi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Long et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Haddad and Blunck, 2011</a>). Remarkably, in VCF experiments, we observed that the F351A GV was correlated with F<sub>high</sub> instead of F<sub>main</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, left), revealing that, similar to KCNE1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), F351A suppressed the intermediate-open state. As a result, F351A current onset was delayed and slowed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, right), resembling WT KCNQ1+KCNE1 current onset, as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boulet et al., 2007</a>). We also observed that, compared to WT KCNQ1, F351A caused significant changes in the Rb<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> permeability ratio (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and the timecourse of inhibition by XE991 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, middle, right). Of note, these properties of F351A were not identical to those of WT KCNQ1+KCNE1. However, such differences are not surprising as prior studies (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Xu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chung et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lvov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Xu et al., 2013</a>) have located KCNE1 at the VSD-pore interface and have suggested that KCNE1 engages in a very broad and complex set of interactions with KCNQ1 (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sun et al., 2012</a>); therefore, it would be unreasonable to expect that a single point mutation, such as F351A, would alter the VSD-pore interactions in exactly the same way as KCNE1. Nonetheless, our studies of F351A provide evidence that the VSD-pore interactions determine the permeation and pharmacological properties of the pore as well as which VSD transitions are required for the pore to open. Therefore, altering VSD-pore interactions is a single mechanism that can explain all of these effects of KCNE1."

Does KCNE1 also affect the interaction between the activated-state of the VSD and the pore to modulate the activated-open state? In order to detect such effects of KCNE1, we used the apparent affinity of E1R/R4E for PIP<sub>2</sub> as a proxy for the strength of VSD-pore interactions in the activated-open state of KCNQ1. The rationale behind this approach was that our previous study has demonstrated that the apparent affinity for PIP<sub>2</sub> correlates with the strength of VSD-pore interaction (<a href=\"#bib87\">Zaydman et al., 2013</a>). In our experiments, we used CiVSP, a voltage-sensitive lipid phosphatase (<a href=\"#bib24\">Iwasaki et al., 2008</a>), to cause a rapid decrease in membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> upon depolarization (<a href=\"#bib17\">Falkenburger et al., 2010</a>) and observed the resulting time-dependent decay in ionic currents resulting from net unbinding of PIP<sub>2</sub>. We found that the decay of E1R/R4E+CiVSP currents were significantly slower and less severe when KCNE1 was present (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting that KCNE1 increases the affinity of the activated-open state of KCNQ1 for PIP<sub>2</sub>. Consistent with this idea, WT KCNQ1+KCNE1 currents, which come from activated-open states exclusively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), were observed to be relatively insensitive to the activity of CiVSP as long as they were maintained in the activated-open state by sustained membrane depolarization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). When the channels were permitted to close, by hyperpolarizing the membrane potential, PIP<sub>2</sub> unbinding was facilitated as evidenced by decreased current amplitude observed with application of a subsequent depolarizing pulse (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Altogether these results reveal that KCNE1 causes the activated-open state to have a high apparent affinity for PIP<sub>2,</sub> suggesting that KCNE1 may increase the strength of VSD-pore interactions in the activated-open state."

We observed that, in KCNQ1, VSD activation occurred in two steps, with and without KCNE1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013H</a>). The first step, leading to an intermediate-state, promoted the opening of homomeric KCNQ1 channels causing the GV to overlap with the first component of the FV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). KCNE1 prevented the channel from opening while the VSD is in the intermediate-state and potentiated opening while the VSD is in the activated state resulting in a GV relationship with a similar voltage-dependence as the second component of the FV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We observed that different states of the VSD yielded functionally different open states (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) of the pore indicating that the unique sets of interactions with different conformations of the VSD determine the probability of pore opening and selects for different open-pore conformations. In agreement with this interpretation, changing the VSD-pore interactions directly, via the mutation F351A, suppressed the intermediate-open state and changed the properties of the open channel (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The ability of this single point mutation at the S4\u2013S5/S6 interface to change the same variety of properties as KCNE1 suggests that a single mechanism for the effects of KCNE1 could be to alter the VSD-pore interactions."

(1) KCNE1 prevented the channel from opening when the VSD was in the intermediate-state suggesting that KCNE1 changes the interactions between the intermediate-state of the VSD and the pore (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). (2) KCNE1 greatly increased the apparent affinity of the activated-open state for PIP<sub>2</sub> suggesting that KCNE1 stabilized the activated-open state interactions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Using kinetic modeling, we sought to test if these experimentally observed effects of KCNE1 on VSD-pore interactions are sufficient to explain the many effects of KCNE1 on KCNQ1 activation gating. Previous Kv channel gating models assume that all four VSDs (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zagotta et al., 1994</a>) or each VSD (<a href=\"#bib23\">Horrigan et al., 1999</a>) must fully activate before the pore can open. Therefore, we could not use these established models as they are not able to represent the coupling between three different states of the VSD and the pore. We developed a new gating model that better reflects the understanding that the VSD and pore can fold and function independently (discussed in our previous review [<a href=\"#bib86\">Zaydman and Cui, 2014</a>]), but couple their motions through state-dependent interactions."

Assuming that the intrinsic activation of each VSD is identical and non-cooperative, as assumed in the ZHA model (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zagotta et al., 1994</a>), the different combinations of the states of the four VSDs and the pore give rise to only 30 possible channel states.

The full model is shown in <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and a shorthand version appears in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>. The main difference between our model and previous allosteric gating models is that the reference state is an imaginary state in which the two domains are completely isolated (i.e., decoupled) from each other, rather than using transitions among the resting states as a reference. The advantage of our approach is that each parameter has an intuitive physical meaning: the k parameters represent the net effect of all interactions within a state of the VSD or the pore, and the \u03b8 parameters represent the net effect of all interactions between the VSD and the pore in a specific channel state."

In order to simulate the effects of KCNE1 on VSD-pore interactions, we made only two changes to the VSD-pore interactions, as suggested by experimental results (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). (1) Experimentally, when KCNE1 was coexpressed, the pore remained closed while the VSD was in the intermediate state (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Thus, to model KCNE1, we strengthened the intermediate-closed state interaction, \u03b8<sub>IC</sub>. (2) Also, in experiments, KCNE1 increased the activated-open state affinity for PIP<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Accordingly, we strengthened the activated-open state interaction, \u03b8<sub>AO</sub>. Making only these two changes mimicked all of the effects of KCNE1 on KCNQ1 activation gating (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). The GV shifted to more depolarized voltages correlating with F<sub>high</sub> because the intermediate-closed state interactions became more energetically favorable than the intermediate-open state interactions, preventing pore opening until a more depolarized voltage-range where the intermediate-to-activated transition occurred. In the absence of intermediate-state opening, the resting-to-intermediate transition occurred among closed states and introduced the characteristic delay of current onset of several hundred milliseconds. The maximal current amplitude was increased several fold due to stabilization of the activated-open state. Furthermore, the stabilization of the intermediate-closed state reduced the current near physiological resting voltages and caused a left shift in main component of the FV curve, two phenomena observed experimentally (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The kinetics and steady-state gating behavior predicted by our model were not quantitatively identical to those in experiments; such discrepancies were expected due to several overly simplistic assumptions that we used to limit the number of states in our model. Particularly, we assumed that PIP<sub>2</sub> binding was saturated, that all open states had identical conductance, and that inactivated states did not exist. However, previous studies highlight that KCNQ1 is not saturated with PIP<sub>2</sub> and that KCNE1 dramatically increases PIP<sub>2</sub> binding (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2011</a>), that KCNE1 increases the apparent single channel conductance (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sesti and Goldstein, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Yang and Sigworth, 1998</a>), and that KCNE1 prevents the observation of a partially inactivated state (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pusch et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Tristani-Firouzi and Sanguinetti, 1998</a>), all of which may contribute to gating and macroscopic current amplitude. Revision of our model to include the influence of PIP<sub>2</sub> binding and the different properties of intermediate- and activated-open states will require additional studies to better define these properties. Despite these limitations, it is remarkable that we were able to capture all the major effects of KCNE1 on the activation gating of KCNQ1. This model illustrates that the effects of KCNE1 on VSD-pore interactions are sufficient to explain how KCNE1 affects the activation gating of KCNQ1 without any additional effects on VSD activation or pore opening. Furthermore, as our experimental data demonstrate that VSD-pore interactions determine the permeation and pharmacological properties (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2,3</a>), our proposed mechanism, that KCNE1 affects VSD-pore interactions, provides a relatively complete explanation for how KCNE1 affects KCNQ1."

In the present study, we coinjected oocytes with KCNQ1 and KCNE1 transcripts at a 1:1 ratio because previous work, from our lab (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2011</a>) and others (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nakajo et al., 2010</a>), demonstrated that this ratio is sufficient to saturate the functional effects of KCNE1 on KCNQ1. In our modeling, we assume that coexpression of KCNE1 affects all four subunits identically as if the channel were saturated by KCNE1, that is, with a 4:4 stoichiometry. This assumption may represent yet another reason why the simulated and experimental gating behavior are not quantitatively identical. Furthermore, it is important to ask, given the ongoing controversy regarding stoichiometry, if the presence of multiple populations of channels with different stoichiometries could complicate our interpretation of our data. Fortunately, the F351A mutation demonstrates that the major finding of our study\u2014the ability to couple pore opening to different transitions within the VSD\u2014is intrinsic to the KCNQ1 subunit and observed even in the absence of the KCNE1 subunit."

                        "text": "In the voltage-gated ion channel field, VSD-pore coupling, aka electromechanical coupling, has been a loosely defined term referring to the experimental observation that pore opening is more likely when the VSDs are activated at depolarized voltages. In our model of voltage-dependent gating, coupling is represented in a very different way than in the previously established models. The landmark linear models of Shaker Kv channels (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schoppa et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Zagotta et al., 1994</a>), which require that all four VSDs be activated before the pore can open, do an excellent job replicating the gating of Shaker Kv channels, but do not explicitly define coupling. Another landmark model, the Horrigan-Cui-Aldrich (HCA) model (<a href=\"#bib23\">Horrigan et al., 1999</a>), permits pore-opening without prior activation of all VSDs. In the HCA model, coupling is quantitatively defined by a single term, D, representing how much the closed-open equilibrium of the pore is biased towards open when a single VSD is transitioned from its fully resting to its fully activated state. Our model further develops from these two previous models. Like the shaker model, we assumed two transitions occurring sequentially and independently within each VSD. Similar to the HCA model, we assumed that pore opening can occur with the four VSDs in any combination of states. In our model, we decomposed D into its elementary components, that is, VSD-pore interactions at each channel state. As a result, each parameter (k, \u03b8) in our model represents a specific set of interactions that exist at the same time in the physical world. The relative differences in the strengths of all these state-dependent VSD-pore interactions lead to the experimental observation that a change in VSD conformation leads to a change in the probability of pore opening, that is, coupling. It is important to understand that coupling is a result of all of these state-dependent interactions and a perturbation of any of these interactions may alter the coupling. These points are illustrated by our modeling of the KCNE1 effect on KCNQ1 channel gating where strengthening the intermediate-closed interactions caused an apparent decoupling of pore-opening from the resting-to-intermediate transition of the VSD, that is, the open probability was no longer increased by the transition of the VSD to the intermediate-state at intermediate voltages. Alternatively, weakening the intermediate-open state interactions would also decouple opening from the resting-to-intermediate state of the VSD; however, this would not reproduce the leftward shift of the first FV component (F<sub>main</sub>) that we observed when KCNE1 was expressed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

                        "text": "The topic of how KCNE1 modulates KCNQ1 has been studied for many years. Early studies by Goldstein and colleagues argued that KCNE1 intercalates deeply into the pore and directly lines the permeation pathway (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goldstein and Miller, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wang et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tai and Goldstein, 1998</a>). Later, the Kass and George labs argued that KCNE1 associates outside the pore and modulates the pore properties through an allosteric mechanism (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kurokawa et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tapper and George, 2001</a>). Then, the efforts of several labs have detected probable interactions between the extracellular (<a href=\"#bib81\">Xu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chan et al., 2012</a>), transmembrane (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tapper and George, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chung et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lvov et al., 2010</a>), and intracellular (<a href=\"#bib20\">Haitin et al., 2009</a>) regions of KCNQ1 and KCNE1. These data have been used to build homology models of the KCNQ1+KCNE1 channel (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lundby et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Xu et al., 2013</a>), all of which place KCNE1 in a cleft between a VSD and the pore where it participates in a broad set of interactions with KCNQ1. Even after all of these excellent studies, there was a lack of a biophysical mechanism to explain how these interactions alter the gating, permeation, and pharmacology of KCNQ1. Prior biophysical studies, which have focused on how KCNE1 slows current onset, have come to conflicting conclusions that KCNE1 either slows VSD activation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nakajo and Kubo, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ruscic et al., 2013</a>) or pore opening (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rocheleau and Kobertz, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Osteen et al., 2010</a>). We believe that the interpretations of these data were limited by several missing pieces of information revealed in the present study: (1) VSD activation occurs through a stable intermediate state, (2) full activation of the VSD is not necessarily required to open the pore, and (3) the distinct interactions between different states of the VSD and the pore determine both the probability of opening and the open-state conformation. Also, it is likely that these previous studies did not consider an effect on the state-dependent VSD-pore interactions because such interactions are not explicitly represented in previously established gating models."

                        "text": "Recently, the Larsson and Kass labs reported the presence of a second fluorescence transition in KCNQ1+KCNE1 channels, which they attributed to pore opening (<a href=\"#bib46\">Osteen et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2012</a>) or a concerted step in which pore opening and further S4 movement occur simultaneously (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</a>). From these observations, they concluded that KCNE1 changes the number of subunits that must be activated before pore opening can occur leading to a right shifted GV and a delay in current onset. This model is most similar to ours in that KCNE1 is changing the relationship between VSD activation and pore opening; however, our model is different in several regards. We believe that the second FV component reports on an intrinsic transition of the VSD rather than the pore opening step. This assumption was based on our observation that homomeric KCNQ1 channels also exhibited a second FV component, with similar properties to that of KCNQ1+KCNE1, which occurred in a range of voltages that was more positive than required for pore opening (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, in our model, channel opening requires an additional transition within a single VSD, rather than the activation of additional subunits. A natural consequence of such gating behavior is the existence of both intermediate-open and activated-open states, which could be detected experimentally and are of great functional importance as the different open states have different conductive and pharmacological properties (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

FV and GV curves were fits with one or the sum of two Boltzmann equations in the form 1/(1 + exp(\u2212z*F*(V \u2212 V<sub>1/2</sub>)/RT)) where z is the equivelant valence of the transition, V<sub>1/2</sub> is the voltage at which the transition is half maximal, R is the gas constant, T is absolute temperature, F is the Faraday constant and V is the voltage. FV curves were derived from the value at the end of the test pulse, GV curved were derived from estimating the instantaneous tail current amplitude."

In this study, the authors use voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) to show that activation of the voltage sensor domain (VSD) of KCNQ1 channels occurs in two resolvable steps. Both the intermediate and fully-activated states of the VSD result in KCNQ1 channel opening, and these states have different permeation and pharmacological properties. The intermediate-open state was absent when KCNQ1 was co-expressed with its beta-subunit KCNE1, suggesting that accessory subunits changes how the VSD and pore interact. The gating of F351A KCNQ1 channels in many ways mimics KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel gating, supporting the main hypothesis. Finally, a kinetic model was developed that can account for many of the effects of KCNE1 on VSD-pore interactions. These findings provide important and novel insights into the mechanism of IKs channel gating as well as a framework for interpreting KCNQ effects that is novel, well substantiated, conceptually simple, and thermodynamically plausible."

KCNQ1 channels inactivate, whereas KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels do not. Some of the deviation between the data and the predictions of the model may be due to KCNQ1 inactivation, which is not detectable using voltage-activation protocols when KCNE1 is present \u2013 something the authors might want to consider in the interpretation of their data."

The model should be modified to account for these important differences in channel properties. One would expect for example two discernible channel open states for KCNQ1 (corresponding to the intermediate-open (O1) and activated-open (O2) states), whereas KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels would have only one open state, with properties similar to the O2 state for KCNQ1 channels. It is stated that \u201cThe maximal current amplitude was increased several fold due to stabilization of the activated-open state\u201d. Presumably, this means only a change in Po, whereas experimental data indicate that KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents are larger mainly due to an increase in single channel conductance (Yang and Sigworth, 1998.

The second transition is indeed present, but it is occurring too quickly to be resolved in the simulated kinetics of KCNQ1. However, it is readily apparent in the steady-state behavior of KCNQ1, and it can be more readily appreciated by altering the parameter values to slow the intermediate-to-activated transition. However, because the parameter space is so vast, we have not yet identified a solution that provides as clear of a demonstration of the steady-state behavior when we make such changes. We have not pursued such a solution further for several reasons. Fist, as described already, our model makes several simplistic assumptions (PIP2 saturated, all open states have equal conductance, no inactivation) that make a perfect fit of our model to the experimental data unlikely. Additionally, we assumed that KCNE1 only increases the intermediate-closed and activated-open interaction because we have experimental evidence that leads us to that such changes occur and are critical to the mechanism of KCNE1. However, it is possible that KCNE1 also affects VSD-pore interactions in other states and those interactions contribute to gating behavior. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that, because our model represents the elementary interactions underlying coupling, it is too underdetermined to identify a single \u201ccorrect\u201d solution of parameter values that may be expected to represent the \u201creal\u201d solution. As we do not intend for our model to be used as a robust gating model that can be plugged into a cell or tissue model, such a solution may be irrelevant in any case. The true power and utility of our model is to provide the conceptual framework to explore how state-dependent interactions contribute to channel gating. For this purpose, we believe that it does a remarkable job and hope that with additional work in future studies we can continue to refine the model so that the kinetics, inactivation, and PIP2 regulation can be better recapitulated by such simple changes in VSD-pore interactions."

Several groups have argued that association of KCNE1 with KCNQ1 dimers during an early stage of biogenesis leads to a fixed 4:2 KCNQ1:KCNE1 stoichiometry and breaks the fourfold symmetry of the channel(Chen, Kim, Rajan, Xu, & Goldstein, 2003; Morin & Kobertz, 2008; Plant, Xiong, Dai, & Goldstein, n.d.; K.

These differences become insignificant at longer pulse durations, which is why we did not show a difference in the original version of the manuscript. As described, we did not expect KCNQ1+KCNE1 to have similar properties as E1R/R4E because KCNE1 alters the activated open state. However, based on our hypothesis that KCNQ1+KCNE1 currents come from channels in the activated-open state, we did expect KCNQ1+KCNE1 to have similar properties as E1R/R4E+KCNE1, which is what we observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."
