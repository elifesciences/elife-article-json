Prolonged early antiretroviral therapy (ART) may reduce the extent of reservoirs and allow for virological control after ART discontinuation. We compared HIV-1 reservoirs in a cross-sectional study using PCR-based techniques in blood and tissue of early treated seroconverters, late treated patients, ART-na\u00efve seroconverters and long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) who have spontaneous virological control without treatment. A decade of early ART reduced total and integrated HIV-1 DNA levels compared to later treatment initiation, but not reaching the low levels of LTNPs. Total HIV-1 DNA in rectal biopsies did not differ between cohorts. Importantly, lower viral transcription (unspliced RNA) and enhanced immune preservation (CD4/CD8) reminiscent of LTNPs were found in early compared to late treated patients. This suggests that early treatment is associated with some immuno-virological features of LTNPs that may improve the outcome of future interventions aimed at a functional cure."
