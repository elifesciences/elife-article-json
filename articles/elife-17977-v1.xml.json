The 'conditional' nature implies that burst activity in dentate gyrus granule cells is required for detonation. Whether single unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) trigger spikes in CA3 neurons remains unknown. Mossy fiber synapses exhibit both pronounced short-term facilitation and uniquely large post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). We tested whether PTP could convert mossy fiber synapses from subdetonator into detonator mode, using a recently developed method to selectively and noninvasively stimulate individual presynaptic terminals in rat brain slices. Unitary EPSPs failed to initiate a spike in CA3 neurons under control conditions, but reliably discharged them after induction of presynaptic short-term plasticity. Remarkably, PTP switched mossy fiber synapses into full detonators for tens of seconds. Plasticity-dependent detonation may be critical for efficient coding, storage, and recall of information in the granule cell\u2013CA3 cell network."

The 'conditional' nature implies that burst activity in dentate gyrus granule cells is required for detonation. Whether single unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) trigger spikes in CA3 neurons remains unknown. Mossy fiber synapses exhibit both pronounced short-term facilitation and uniquely large post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). We tested whether PTP could convert mossy fiber synapses from subdetonator into detonator mode, using a recently developed method to selectively and noninvasively stimulate individual presynaptic terminals in rat brain slices. Unitary EPSPs failed to initiate a spike in CA3 neurons under control conditions, but reliably discharged them after induction of presynaptic short-term plasticity. Remarkably, PTP switched mossy fiber synapses into full detonators for tens of seconds.

                        "text": "The strength of a synapse in relation to action potential threshold is a key factor that defines its role in neuronal information processing. In neocortical and hippocampal circuits, it is generally thought that individual synapses are weak, and that temporal or spatial summation of unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) is required to reach the firing threshold (<a href=\"#bib33\">London and H\u00e4usser, 2005</a>). In contrast, in the peripheral nervous system and brainstem, \u2018detonator\u2019 synapses are abundant, which directly control the activity of postsynaptic targets in the absence of temporal and spatial summation. Well established examples of detonator synapses include the neuromuscular junction (<a href=\"#bib24\">Katz, 1969</a>) and the calyx of Held in the auditory brainstem (<a href=\"#bib8\">Borst et al., 1995</a>). Whether detonator synapses exist in higher brain regions is presently unclear. Resolving this question has important implications for understanding the nature of information encoding and the rules of synaptic computation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Koch and Segev, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">London and H\u00e4usser, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Silver, 2010</a>). In a network with weak synapses below detonation, activity in an ensemble of multiple convergent presynaptic neurons is required to activate a postsynaptic cell. In contrast, in a network with strong synapses near detonation, activity of a single connected presynaptic neuron may be sufficient to drive a postsynaptic cell and to initiate a behaviorally relevant output (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brecht et al., 2004</a>)."

However, the efficacy of this key hippocampal synapse has not been quantified. Structural properties suggested that mossy fiber synapses are highly efficient, because of proximal dendritic location, multiple release sites, and large vesicular pool (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acs\u00e1dy et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chicurel and Harris, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rollenhagen et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, functional analysis <i>in vitro</i> indicated that mossy fiber synapses have a low release probability (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lawrence et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</a>) and that a single mossy fiber EPSP is insufficient to drive postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brown and Johnston, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jonas et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mori et al., 2004</a>). However, <i>in vitro</i> analysis also revealed that mossy fiber synapses show substantial facilitation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Salin et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Toth et al., 2000</a>). Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> experiments demonstrated that high-frequency firing in granule cells and subsequent temporal summation initiates spikes in target pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Henze et al., 2002</a>). This has led to the hypothesis that the mossy fiber synapse operates as a 'conditional detonator' (<a href=\"#bib22\">Henze et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pelkey and McBain, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Urban et al., 2001</a>). Alternatively, spatial summation of inputs from multiple mossy fiber synapses, or spatial summation of mossy fiber and non-mossy fiber inputs may be required for spike initiation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Henze et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pelkey and McBain, 2005</a>). Whether single unitary mossy fiber EPSPs trigger spikes in CA3 pyramidal neurons in the absence of summation is currently unknown."

Single mossy fiber terminals were stimulated in the tight-seal, bouton-attached configuration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>), while postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neurons were simultaneously recorded in the whole-cell configuration at near-physiological temperature (31\u201334\u00b0C) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alcami et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bischofberger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Perkins, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</a>). Bouton-attached stimulation enabled precise control of electrical activity, as verified by the appearance of action currents in the presynaptic terminal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Recently, this method was also successfully used at the calyx of Held (<a href=\"#bib2\">Acuna et al., 2015</a>). Hippocampal granule cells <i>in vivo</i> fire both single action potentials and bursts of spikes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pern\u00eda-Andrade and Jonas, 2014</a>). We first examined the properties of synaptic transmission evoked by single presynaptic action potentials at mossy fiber\u2013CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Single unitary EPSPs had a mean latency of 1.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 ms, a peak amplitude of 9.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4 mV, a 20\u201380% rise time of 3.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 ms, and a decay time constant of 134\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010 ms (6\u20138 pairs; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013I</a>). Furthermore, single unitary EPSPs triggered action potentials with a mean probability of only 0.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08. Thus, single unitary mossy fiber EPSPs failed to reliably induce action potential initiation in postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neurons."

Three brief stimuli were applied at a frequency of 50 Hz, resembling burst activity in hippocampal granule cells <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pern\u00eda-Andrade and Jonas, 2014</a>).

Can PTP convert mossy fiber synapses from a subdetonator into a detonator mode? To address this question, we measured the probability of postsynaptic action potential initiation before and after high-frequency stimulation (HFS, 100 stimuli delivered at 100 Hz), a paradigm that reliably induces PTP (<a href=\"#bib18\">Griffith, 1990</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Intriguingly, HFS substantially increased the probability of spiking for the first stimulus, from 0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 under control conditions to 0.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 at the peak and to 0.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16 in a 100 s time window following HFS (22 to 122 s; seven pairs; p=0.03; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>).

Enhanced detonation decayed with a time constant of 67 s, indicating that the alteration was long lasting (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). HFS also increased the probability of spiking for the second and the third stimulus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In the same paired-recordings, the extent of PTP, quantified from the maximal slope of the rising phase of EPSP<sub>1</sub>, was 442% at the peak and 348% in the 100 s time interval following HFS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>).

The activity dependence of PTP at different synapses is not precisely known. The amount of PTP appears to depend on both the frequency (<a href=\"#bib18\">Griffith, 1990</a>) and the number of action potentials (<a href=\"#bib20\">Habets and Borst, 2005</a>), and may also be influenced by other forms of presynaptic plasticity (e.g. frequency facilitation, <a href=\"#bib44\">Salin et al., 1996</a>). However, recent <i>in vivo</i> whole-cell patch-clamp recordings suggest that granule cells in awake rats and mice occasionally fire bursts of\u00a0&gt;10 action potentials (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pern\u00eda-Andrade and Jonas, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Vyleta et al., 2016</a>).

Importantly, as granule cell activity seems to be spatially tuned (<a href=\"#bib14\">Danielson et al., 2016</a>), even more action potentials may be generated during a long-term stay of the animal in the center of the place field, or if it visits the same place field repeatedly during exploration of the spatial environment (<a href=\"#bib14\">Danielson et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012</a>).

Although disynaptic inhibition appears to be too slow to affect single action potential generation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Torborg et al., 2010</a>) or the rapid detonation that we record here during the PTP phase, inhibition likely prevents excessive depolarization and burst firing of CA3 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Torborg et al., 2010</a>). It should be noted that recruitment of inhibition by cell-attached stimulation of a mossy fiber bouton may be different from that with a physiological stimulus (synaptic activity in granule cell dendrites) for two reasons. First, orthodromic action potential propagation may recruit feedforward inhibition more rapidly and effectively than antidromic action potentials initiated at the mossy fiber terminal. Second, the mossy fiber axon may not be fully maintained in the slice preparation. However, it appears that due to the minimal delay of monosynaptic excitation, large EPSPs during synaptic enhancement are capable of driving pyramidal cell firing before the effects of disynaptic inhibition."

Current models of hippocampal function suggest that the dentate gyrus processes multimodal sensory inputs by pattern separation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Leutgeb et al., 2007</a>) and represents this information in a sparse coding scheme (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pern\u00eda-Andrade and Jonas, 2014</a>).

How sparse \u2018engrams\u2019 are relayed from the dentate gyrus to the CA3 region has been unclear (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). In the subdetonation mode, activation of several granule cells by multiple highly specific patterns would be necessary to activate a given CA3 pyramidal neuron (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Given the sparse activity of granule cells, this is an unlikely scenario. In contrast, in the full detonation mode, activation of a single granule cell by a single pattern would be sufficient to trigger activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, left). Furthermore, in the full detonation mode, a single action potential in a granule cell should activate an ensemble of\u00a0~15 CA3 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, right) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Amaral et al., 1990</a>).

Action potential initiation in CA3 pyramidal cells requires spatial summation (e.g. activation of multiple granule cells; left) or temporal summation (e.g. repetitive activation of a single granule cell, right). In the spatial summation scenario, mossy fiber transmission will implement a logic \u2018and\u2019 operation. Specific wiring rules in the network could be generated by structural plasticity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Galimberti et al., 2006</a>). Activation of multiple distal perforant path synapses may substitute for the activation of single proximal mossy fiber inputs. (<b>B</b>)\u00a0Synaptic computations in the dentate gyrus\u2013CA3 cell network in a full detonation regime (e.g. during PTP). Action potential initiation in CA3 pyramidal cells is possible after a single action potential in a single granule cell (left). Thus, plasticity-dependent detonation at mossy fiber synapses will enable a logic \u2018or\u2019 operation and allow a single highly specific cue to trigger the encoding, storage, or recall of complex information in CA3 pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib42\">Quiroga et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</a>). Additionally, a single spike in a single granule cell may not only activate a single CA3 pyramidal cell, but rather an ensemble of\u00a0~15 CA3 cells. Thus, plasticity-dependent detonation at mossy fiber synapses will contribute to the generation of ensemble activity in the hippocampal network.

The presynaptic holding potential was set at \u201370 or \u201380 mV to minimize the holding current (typically between 0 and \u20135 pA) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alcami et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Perkins, 2006</a>). Action potentials in mossy fiber boutons were evoked by brief voltage pulses (amplitude\u00a0&lt;1 V, duration 0.05\u20130.1 ms). Action currents showed an all-or-none behavior, were reliably evoked by each short pulse above threshold, and followed the brief voltage stimuli after short time intervals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>); late or spontaneous action currents did not occur (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</a>). Furthermore, action currents were tightly correlated with the occurrence of EPSCs in the recorded postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neuron (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, bouton-attached stimulation permitted the precise control of activity in a single presynaptic input. Boutons had diameters of\u00a0~3\u20135 \u00b5m, in close agreement with the previously reported range of diameters of mossy fiber boutons in light and electron microscopy studies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acs\u00e1dy et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Amaral and Dent, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bischofberger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chicurel and Harris, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rollenhagen et al., 2007</a>).

This formulation provides low series resistance for improved resolution of the kinetics of synaptic events and action potentials, and high electrode stability for accurately setting the resting potential of the cell, but sets E<sub>Cl</sub> at ~\u201345 mV. Because GABAergic signaling is hyperpolarizing at CA3 pyramidal neurons after early development (<a href=\"#bib6\">Banke and McBain, 2006</a>), inhibition was not preserved in our recording conditions. In a subset of EPSC experiments, 2 mM QX-314 was added to block action potential initiation in the postsynaptic neuron. Current-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings were performed at \u201370 mV, and only recordings with\u00a0&lt;150 pA injection of hyperpolarizing current were included in analyses.

Postsynaptic series resistance ranged from 3.9\u201313.2 M\u03a9, median 5.9 M\u03a9. In current clamp mode, series resistance was fully compensated using the bridge balance circuit of the amplifier. In the voltage-clamp mode, series resistance was uncompensated, but carefully monitored with a test pulse following each data acquisition sweep. Only recordings with stable series resistance were included in analyses. Paired recordings with tight-seal, bouton-attached stimulation were stable for up to 30 min.

Pulse generation and data acquisition were performed using FPulse version 3.3.3 (U. Fr\u00f6be, Physiological Institute, University of Freiburg, Germany). Data were analyzed with Stimfit version 0.13.17 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Guzman et al., 2014</a>)\u00a0and Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). In a subset of recordings, traces of unitary EPSPs were filtered (low-pass digital filter, cut-off frequency of 1 kHz) for robust analysis of maximal slope of the rising phase of individual EPSPs. Mean EPSP and EPSC parameters were measured from average waveforms of individual recordings and averaged across recordings. Latencies were measured from the beginning of the presynaptic stimulus (0.1 ms duration) to the onset of the synaptic event unless stated differently. EPSP or EPSC onset was defined as the intersection of a line in the rising phase through 20 and 80% of the peak amplitude and the preceding baseline. For EPSPs, EPSCs, and action potentials, the analysis time window was set between 0 and 10 ms after the stimulus. EPSP decay time course was fit with a monoexponential function including an offset. For calculating facilitation ratios, EPSC peak amplitudes were normalized to the value for the first EPSC of a train. To quantify synaptic efficacy in EPSP recordings with overlaying action potential initiation in a subset of traces, the maximal slope of the EPSP was used as a parameter. The maximal EPSP slope was calculated as the maximum of the first derivative of the rising phase of the EPSP. Time-derivatives were calculated using a 60-\u03bcs temporal window. PTP decay time course was fit with a monoexponential function including an offset. To assess the extent of temporal summation, we simulated the superposition of three EPSPs of identical peak amplitude, shifted in time by 20 ms. The EPSP decay time constant was assumed to be 134 ms, consistent with the experimentally measured value for single unitary mossy fiber EPSPs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>)."

Although much is known about transmission at these synapses, e.g., low initial release probability and marked short term potentiation, the current paper re-explores the properties of transmission with high resolution recording techniques, combining cell attached recordings from individual presynaptic boutons with whole cell recordings from postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal cells. The authors demonstrate that single synaptic connections can be transformed from \"conditional detonators\" where reliable action potentials are triggered only after summation of a few synaptic potentials in a train, to one where the action potential probability triggered by unitary events is increased following high frequency induced post-tetanic potentiation. This transition converts synapses into reliable detonators."

However, we appreciate the potential limitation of this approach, as pointed out by the reviewer.

If disynaptic GABAergic conductances contributed significantly to depolarization of the pyramidal neuron during presynaptic stimulus trains, we would predict that blocking GABAA receptors with gabazine would significantly change the time course of postsynaptic currents and reduce the total charge during train stimulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We have tested this prediction in our experimental data. However, we found no statistically significant differences between recordings in gabazine (10 \u00b5M) and in the absence of blockers (n = 4 and 9, respectively) for EPSC<sub>1</sub> rise times (20-80%; 0.65 \u00b1 0.18 ms versus 0.67 \u00b1 0.06 ms, P = 0.26), EPSC<sub>1</sub> decay \u03c4 (5.4 \u00b1 0.97 versus 6.5 \u00b1 0.54 ms, P = 0.30), and total charge during the 3 x 50-Hz stimulus train (25.1 \u00b1 10.1 versus 39.4 \u00b1 7.6 pC; 60 ms integration time; P = 0.31). These results are consistent with the assumption that GABAergic currents do not significantly contribute to evoked synaptic potentials in our recordings. Importantly, the \u201cconditional detonation\u201d we observe in response to stimulus trains is very similar to that previously reported in in vivo experiments where inhibition is fully intact (Henze et al., 2002). We have added the corresponding quantitative data to the Methods section (subsection \u201cBouton-attached stimulation and paired recording\u201d). We have also added a statement to the Methods section describing that inhibition was not preserved in our recording conditions, and have included a reference to Banke and McBain (2006), where GABAergic signaling was shown to be hyperpolarizing at CA3 pyramidal neurons after early development (subsection \u201cBouton-attached stimulation and paired recording\u201d, last paragraph)."

In our experiments, the latency from the stimulus to the maximum slope of the EPSP preceding AP generation in the PTP phase was 1.5 \u00b1 0.09 ms (n = 7). Torborg et al., (2010) determined that the latency between monosynaptic excitation and disynaptic inhibition in CA3 pyramidal neurons was, on average, 2.2 ms. Thus, feedforward inhibition would be predicted to occur ~3.7 ms after the stimulus. However, in our experiments the latency from the stimulus to action potential onset in the PTP phase was only 3.1 \u00b1 0.09 ms (n = 7). Thus, disynaptic inhibition comes too late to affect the probability of action potential initiation. Consistent with this argument, Torborg et al., (2010) found no effect of blocking GABAA receptors on latency, jitter, and initiation probability of single action potentials evoked by mossy fiber stimulation, and concluded that \u201c[\u2026] mossy fiber-driven feedforward inhibition does not substantially influence the timing of single action potentials in CA3 pyramidal cells, but rather provides a potent mechanism to prevent excessive depolarization and burst firing of CA3 pyramidal cells.\u201d Furthermore, the authors concluded that \u201c[\u2026] the temporal precision of action potentials is likely governed by the kinetics of the EPSP itself [\u2026] largely independent of inhibition\u201d (Torborg et al., 2010). We have added a sentence to the Results section to describe the latency data (last paragraph). We have also added a paragraph to the Discussion to explain the role of inhibition, including a reference to the paper by Torborg et al., 2010 (third paragraph)."
