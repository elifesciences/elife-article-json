One proposed gain-of-function mechanism is that repeat-containing RNA forms aggregates that sequester RNA binding proteins, leading to altered RNA metabolism in motor neurons. Here, we identify the zinc finger protein Zfp106 as a specific GGGGCC RNA repeat-binding protein, and using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we show that Zfp106 interacts with multiple other RNA binding proteins, including the ALS-associated factors TDP-43 and FUS. We also show that <i>Zfp106</i> knockout mice develop severe motor neuron degeneration, which can be suppressed by transgenic restoration of Zfp106 specifically in motor neurons. Finally, we show that Zfp106 potently suppresses neurotoxicity in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of <i>C9orf72</i> ALS. Thus, these studies identify Zfp106 as an RNA binding protein with important implications for ALS."

One proposed gain-of-function mechanism is that repeat-containing RNA forms aggregates that sequester RNA binding proteins, leading to altered RNA metabolism in motor neurons. Here, we identify the zinc finger protein Zfp106 as a specific GGGGCC RNA repeat-binding protein, and using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we show that Zfp106 interacts with multiple other RNA binding proteins, including the ALS-associated factors TDP-43 and FUS. We also show that <i>Zfp106</i> knockout mice develop severe motor neuron degeneration, which can be suppressed by transgenic restoration of Zfp106 specifically in motor neurons. Finally, we show that Zfp106 potently suppresses neurotoxicity in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of <i>C9orf72</i> ALS. Thus, these studies identify Zfp106 as an RNA binding protein with important implications for ALS."

For example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a deadly disease caused by the gradual loss of the nerve cells that control muscle (known as motor neurons). The most common cause of inherited ALS is a genetic mutation that results in some RNA molecules having many more copies of a simple six nucleotide sequence known as GGGGCC than normal cells.

The repeat expansion has been identified in more than 40% of familial ALS and in at least 7% of sporadic cases (<a href=\"#bib30\">Majounie et al., 2012</a>). Several gain-of-function mechanisms for how the expanded hexanucleotide repeats cause disease have been proposed. One idea suggests that toxic dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins generated by repeat associated non-ATG (RAN) translation of the RNA repeats cause neurodegeneration (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kwon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mizielinska et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mori et al., 2013</a>).

Therefore, to identify rGGGGCC-binding proteins that may be sequestered by repeat-containing RNA and involved in the pathology of <i>C9orf72</i> ALS, we performed a pull-down assay using biotinylated r(GGGGCC)<sub>8</sub> RNA and identified the zinc finger protein Zfp106 as a previously unknown rGGGGCC-binding protein. Zfp106 bound specifically to r(GGGGCC)<sub>8</sub> but not the control sequence r(AAAACC)<sub>8</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using purified Zfp106 protein demonstrated that Zfp106 bound directly to the rGGGGCC repeats and that this binding was specific since it was efficiently competed by unlabeled self oligonucleotide but not a 30\u00d7 molar excess of the control oligonucleotide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). Importantly, Zfp106 binding to r(GGGGCC)<sub>4</sub> was not competed by 30\u00d7 molar excess of a mutated RNA probe of equal length, nor was it competed by 30\u00d7 molar excess of rCUG repeats comprising a MBNL1 binding site (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). Likewise, MBNL1, an unrelated RNA-binding protein involved in myotonic dystrophy (<a href=\"#bib32\">Miller et al., 2000</a>), bound efficiently and specifically to rCUG repeats under conditions in which Zfp106 showed no binding to the same rCUG sequence (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>) and, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib39\">Reddy et al., 2013</a>), was not able to bind GGGGCC repeats (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). Together, these data demonstrate that Zfp106 binds efficiently and specifically to GGGGCC RNA repeats."

Transverse sections of the quadriceps from 4-week-old <i>Zfp106</i>-null mice showed increased variation in fiber size and evidence of grouped atrophy with very few centrally located nuclei (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,b</a>), consistent with neurogenic rather than myopathic disease (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baloh et al., 2007</a>). By three months of age, near end stage disease, <i>Zfp106</i>-null mice displayed extensive muscular atrophy and severe degeneration of muscle fibers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c,d</a>). The number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive motor neurons was also profoundly and significantly reduced in <i>Zfp106</i> knockout spinal cords compared to littermate control mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e\u2013i</a>), providing further evidence that loss of Zfp106 in mice causes a neurodegenerative phenotype. Independently, we confirmed the knockout phenotype observed with the KOMP allele (<a href=\"#bib51\">van der Weyden et al., 2011</a>) using CRISPR-mediated gene disruption by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and creation of a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon.

This approach showed <i>Zfp106</i> expression in both skeletal muscle and motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a,b</a>). Given the multiple lines of evidence for a role of Zfp106 in neurodegeneration, and the evident denervation observed in the knockout mice, we hypothesized that the primary requirement for Zfp106 was likely to be in motor neurons. We confirmed a highly significant and dramatic reduction in <i>Zfp106</i> expression in spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>). The ~80% reduction in <i>Zfp106</i> expression is consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Joyce et al., 2016</a>). Therefore, we used a transgenic approach in mice to restore Zfp106 expression only in motor neurons under the control of the <i>Mnx1</i> promoter (herein called <i>HB9</i>, <i>HB9-Zfp106</i>) on a <i>Zfp106</i> germline knockout background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2j</a>; and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3b,c</a>).

Interestingly, several of the Zfp106-interacting proteins identified in our affinity purification-mass spectrometry experiment are proteins directly associated with ALS and/or <i>C9orf72</i> ALS, including splicing factors TDP-43 and FUS, the nucleolar protein Nucleolin, and the nuclear pore component Nup107 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Freibaum et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Haeusler et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lagier-Tourenne et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ling et al., 2013</a>); <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

Here, we used the GAL4-UAS system to coexpress mouse Zfp106 and GGGGCC repeats in the fly in a gain-of-function approach to determine if the interaction between Zfp106 and GGGGCC repeats had a functional consequence in this model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). Expression of 30 tandem copies of the GGGGCC hexanucleotide in the 5\u2032-untranslated region of a UAS-dependent <i>gfp</i> transcript (30R-GFP) in glutamatergic neurons using OK371-GAL4 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mahr and Aberle, 2006</a>) caused\u00a0~50% lethality due to an apparent failure of flies to eclose from the pupal case (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Furthermore, 28 day-old OK371; 30R-GFP-expressing flies that did manage to successfully eclose exhibited profound defects in locomotor activity compared to control flies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). No overt eclosion or locomotor phenotype was observed in flies expressing GFP only, 3R-GFP, or Zfp106 alone in glutamatergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,b</a>). Previous studies have also shown that expression of 30R-GFP causes a reduction in the number of active zones in Drosophila larval neuromuscular junctions (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Consistent with those studies, we found that expression of 30R-GFP reduced active zones as measured by anti-Bruchpilot (Brp) immunofluorescence and quantification (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c\u2013f</a>). Remarkably, co-expression of Zfp106 with 30R-GFP restored Brp expression at larval active zones (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c\u2013f</a>) and completely suppressed the\u00a0~50% lethality caused by expression of 30R-GFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Moreover, co-expression of Zfp106 partially suppressed the adult locomotor defect caused by expression of 30R-GFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). Importantly, co-expression of Zfp106 did not result in a reduction in the expression of 30R-GFP mRNA <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>), indicating that the suppression of the neurotoxic phenotype in Drosophila was not due to dilution of GAL4 protein. Taken together, these data show that Zfp106 is a potent suppressor of neurodegeneration in a <i>C9orf72</i> ALS model, and the results from this gain-of-function model support the idea that Zfp106 functionally interacts with <i>C9orf72</i> GGGGCC RNA repeats."

Previous studies have suggested roles for Zfp106 in rDNA transcription and in pre-rRNA processing (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ide and Dejardin, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tafforeau et al., 2013</a>). Zfp106 was also identified as a polyadenylated mRNA binding protein in an interactome capture study aimed at defining an atlas of mammalian mRNA binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Castello et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, our interactome data also suggest possible roles for Zfp106 in multiple steps of RNA metabolism and processing and interaction with key RNA binding proteins involved in various forms of neurodegeneration. Precisely how disrupting these processes leads to neurodegeneration and exactly how this relates to <i>C9orf72</i> ALS/FTD remains to be determined. A simple model is that sequestration of Zfp106 by the expanded repeats disrupts normal Zfp106 function in patients with <i>C9orf72</i> ALS in a sponge-like mechanism (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cooper-Knock et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mizielinska and Isaacs, 2014</a>). Alternatively, one might speculate that Zfp106 plays other functions important in the biology of <i>C9orf72</i>, such as influencing dipeptide repeat protein (DPR) production or affecting nucleolar function or nucleocytoplasmic transport via interactions with Nucleolin or Nup107, which have also been implicated in the pathobiology of <i>C9orf72</i> ALS (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boeynaems et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Freibaum et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Haeusler et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jovi\u010di\u0107 et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kwon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Future studies will address the molecular targets and mechanisms of action of Zfp106 in order to gain further insights into the pathogenesis of <i>C9orf72</i> ALS and to identify new possible therapeutic targets for neuroprotection."

The bait-prey datasets were analyzed with the APMS scoring algorithm MiST (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jager et al., 2012</a>), and an in-house curated APMS dataset used for determining machine background noise. The MiST algorithm compares peak intensities from the mass spectrum to determine abundance, reproducibility across multiple replicated experiments (n\u00a0=\u00a05 for each condition), and specificity based on the uniqueness of each interaction, and then these three metrics are used to determine a composite score by the algorithm (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jager et al., 2012</a>). The Zfp106 interactome was compiled by selecting bait-prey pairs with a top 5% MiST score.

Starting with a biotinylated RNA pulldown of neural nuclear proteins, the authors identify Zfp106. They go on to show that Zfp106 loss-of-function causes an ALS-like phenotype in mice, and that it can be suppressed by transgenic restoration of Zfp106 specifically in motor neurons.

In order to link Zfp106 more specifically to an ALS model of neuromuscular disease they employ a well-established <i>Drosophila</i> model of <i>C9orf72</i> repeat overexpression in motor neurons and show phenotypic rescue with Zfp106 overexpression.

However, it remains unclear from the descriptions provided in the paper exactly what mutations were made to the Zpf106 gene and what this figure really shows. The description of the CRISPR mutation suggests this was two point mutations in exon 1 generated in separate lines, that were then crossed to each other to make a KO? It sounds from the methods as if the primers were against exons 21-22 far away from the mutation itself. If this is a point mutation mouse then why would the RNA be reduced? And if these are both null lines, why is the RNA expression for both the KO and the CRISPR mouse not completely gone (since these are not cell type specific)? I'm guessing that the answer to both of these questions is nonsense-mediated decay, but I thought that was uncommon with the CRISPR point mutations and anyway if this is the case then better to explain in the text than to have the reader fill in the gaps. Finally, given that the authors have an antibody against Zpf106 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) the authors should show loss of protein to validate that these actually are null alleles."

If there is one such orthologue and if this orthologue does not rescue neurodegeneration in C9 flies, then the rescue effect of mouse Zfp showed by the authors is not through Zfp evolutionarily conserved functions, but possibly an artifact, which raises a critical concern about the study's translatability. Without any evidence that the mouse Zfp is functional in flies (e.g. is it properly localized, post-translationally modified, or regulating the same genes as it normally does in mice?), the data that this protein rescues neuronal defects in C9-ALS flies may not be biologically meaningful at all. The authors in this case need to test whether mouse Zfp rescues neurodegeneration in C9-ALS mice. Otherwise, they need to identify downstream genes through which the mouse Zfp suppresses C9 defects in flies and then validate in mammals that the orthologues of these genes are indeed downstream targets of Zfp. In addition, the rebuttal is confusing because it claims that the authors did not argue a \"rescue\", but rather a \"suppression\" of C9-phenotypes (although I did not see a profound difference between them), whereas in the legend of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, the authors said \"this defect was completed rescued by co-expression of Zfp106\"."

The description of the CRISPR mutation suggests this was two point mutations in exon 1 generated in separate lines, that were then crossed to each other to make a KO? It sounds from the methods as if the primers were against exons 21-22 far away from the mutation itself. If this is a point mutation mouse then why would the RNA be reduced? And if these are both null lines, why is the RNA expression for both the KO and the CRISPR mouse not completely gone (since these are not cell type specific)? I'm guessing that the answer to both of these questions is nonsense-mediated decay, but I thought that was uncommon with the CRISPR point mutations and anyway if this is the case then better to explain in the text than to have the reader fill in the gaps.

(This is not trivial, as FlyBase curators may ask you even after you publish your paper.) If there is one such orthologue and if this orthologue does not rescue neurodegeneration in C9 flies, then the rescue effect of mouse Zfp showed by the authors is not through Zfp evolutionarily conserved functions, but possibly an artifact, which raises a critical concern about the study's translatability. Without any evidence that the mouse Zfp is functional in flies (e.g. is it properly localized, post-translationally modified, or regulating the same genes as it normally does in mice?) the data that this protein rescues neuronal defects in C9-ALS flies may not be biologically meaningful at all. The authors in this case need to test whether mouse Zfp rescues neurodegeneration in C9-ALS mice. Otherwise, they need to identify downstream genes through which the mouse Zfp suppresses C9 defects in flies and then validate in mammals that the orthologues of these genes are indeed downstream targets of Zfp. In addition, the rebuttal is confusing because it claims that the authors did not argue a \"rescue\", but rather a \"suppression\" of C9-phenotypes (although I did not see a profound difference between them), whereas in the legend of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, the authors said \"this defect was completed rescued by co-expression of Zfp106\".</i> "

To clarify, we are using <i>Drosophila</i> in these experiments solely as a gain-of-function model \u2013 there is no clear ortholog of <i>C9orf72</i> or the expanded hexanucleotide repeat sequence from <i>C9orf72</i> in the fly, yet the overexpression model used here and elsewhere is accepted as a gain-of-function model for <i>C9orf72</i>-mediated neurodegeneration/neurotoxicity. Similarly, we use a purely gain-of-function approach with mammalian <i>Zfp106</i> expression in the fly to examine whether the interaction of Zfp106 with GGGGCC repeats is a functional interaction. We have further clarified the gain-of-function design of our approach in eighth paragraph of the Results and Discussion section, and have emphasized that Zfp106 suppresses rather than rescues repeat-mediated neurotoxicity."

Moreover, these extensive new experiments would not change the key conclusion that Zfp106 functionally interacts with the hexanucleotide repeats to suppress neurotoxicity in the fly. This key result, taken together with RNA EMSA and other experiments, which show a biochemical interaction between Zfp106 and the hexanucleotide repeats, clearly establish the physical and functional interaction of Zfp106 with GGGGCC repeats."
