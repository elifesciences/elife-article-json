The mother centriole recruits and organises the PCM and templates the formation of the daughter centriole. It has been reported that several important <i>Drosophila</i> PCM-organising proteins are recruited to centrioles from the cytosol as part of large cytoplasmic \u2018S-CAP\u2019 complexes that contain the centriole protein Sas-4. In a previous paper (<a href=\"#bib5\">Conduit et al., 2014b</a>) we showed that one of these proteins, Cnn, and another key PCM-organising protein, Spd-2, are recruited around the mother centriole before spreading outwards to form a scaffold that supports mitotic PCM assembly; the recruitment of Cnn and Spd-2 is dependent on another S-CAP protein, Asl. We show here, however, that Cnn, Spd-2 and Asl are not recruited to the mother centriole as part of a complex with Sas-4. Thus, PCM recruitment in fly embryos does not appear to require cytosolic S-CAP complexes."

The mother centriole recruits and organises the PCM and templates the formation of the daughter centriole. It has been reported that several important <i>Drosophila</i> PCM-organising proteins are recruited to centrioles from the cytosol as part of large cytoplasmic \u2018S-CAP\u2019 complexes that contain the centriole protein Sas-4. In a previous paper (<a href=\"#bib5\">Conduit et al., 2014b</a>) we showed that one of these proteins, Cnn, and another key PCM-organising protein, Spd-2, are recruited around the mother centriole before spreading outwards to form a scaffold that supports mitotic PCM assembly; the recruitment of Cnn and Spd-2 is dependent on another S-CAP protein, Asl. We show here, however, that Cnn, Spd-2 and Asl are not recruited to the mother centriole as part of a complex with Sas-4. Thus, PCM recruitment in fly embryos does not appear to require cytosolic S-CAP complexes."

We previously showed that Cnn and Spd-2 are initially recruited around mother centrioles and then spread outward to form an extended pericentriolar material (PCM) scaffold (<a href=\"#bib4\">Conduit et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2014b</a>) (Note that we define \u2018recruitment\u2019 here as when a new protein molecule is added into the centrosome from the cytosol, irrespective of whether this molecule replaces an existing molecule or adds to the existing pool of molecules). Cnn has previously been identified as part of a multi-protein \u2018S-CAP\u2019 complex, which pre-assembles in the cytosol with the centriole protein Sas-4 before being recruited into the centrosome via a Sas-4\u2013centriole interaction (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>). We reasoned, therefore, that Cnn and Spd-2 molecules might initially be recruited to the centrioles in S-CAP complexes, but could then be released from the centriolar-Sas-4 to spread outwards through the PCM. To test this possibility we compared the spatiotemporal centrosomal recruitment of Sas-4 to Cnn or Spd-2 in living <i>Drosophila</i> syncytial embryos, where S-CAP complexes were initially identified (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011</a>). These embryos cycle rapidly between S- and M-phases with no gap phases, and the mother centrioles organise large amounts of PCM throughout both S- and M-phases; during S-phase, each mother centriole also assembles a new daughter centriole (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

We first examined the centrosomal recruitment of these proteins from the cytosol during S-phase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1, 2</a>). Prior to photobleaching, Sas-4-mCherry appeared as a single tight spot, presumably localising to the two centrioles (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Fu and Glover, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Mennella et al., 2012</a>), which cannot be resolved with a standard confocal microscope; GFP-Cnn and Spd-2-GFP occupied a relatively broad area around the centrioles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>; t = \u221230 s), consistent with their known PCM localisation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Conduit et al., 2014b</a>). The centrosomal fluorescence of all three proteins recovered after photobleaching, but we noticed that the recovering GFP and mCherry signals were not aligned in the X-Y plane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>; t = 60\u2013180 s). We plotted the relative positions of the recovering signals after using fluorescent beads to adjust for any systemic shift between the green and red channels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), and calculated the average distance between the recovering signals: at 60 s post bleaching, recovering Sas-4-mCherry was offset from recovering GFP-Cnn by an average of \u223c0.21 \u03bcm (<i>blue</i> dots, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) and from recovering Spd-2-GFP by an average of \u223c0.17 \u03bcm (<i>orange</i> dots, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). In contrast, the recovering Spd-2-GFP signal was offset from the recovering RFP-Cnn signal by an average of only \u223c0.053 \u03bcm (<i>purple</i> dots, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). We illustrate these differences by displaying the average fluorescence profiles of each pair of markers offset by the average distance between each marker at 60 s post-bleaching (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E,G</a>)."

We wondered, therefore, if the offset between the Sas-4-mCherry and GFP-Cnn or Spd-2-GFP recovering signals was a result of Sas-4-mCherry being largely recruited to daughter centrioles and GFP-Cnn and Spd-2-GFP being largely recruited around mother centrioles."

These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that Sas-4 molecules are only recruited to growing daughter centrioles, and they strongly suggest that the Cnn and Spd-2 molecules that are recruited around mother centrioles during M-phase are not recruited there as part of a complex with Sas-4."

During late M-phase the centrioles disengage and the daughter centriole matures into a mother and starts to organise its own domain of PCM.

                                "text": "In order to directly test if Sas-4 molecules are only recruited to growing daughter centrioles, we turned to 3D-Structured Illumination Microscopy (3D-SIM), which has approximately twice the spatial resolution of standard confocal microscopy. Using 3D-SIM in living embryos, we could clearly distinguish two adjacent Sas-4-GFP foci at individual centrosomes during S-phase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, t = \u221220 s), presumably representing mother-daughter centriole pairs. We combined 3D-SIM with FRAP (<a href=\"#bib5\">Conduit et al., 2014b</a>) and found that the Sas-4-GFP signal only recovered at a single foci (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, t = 120 s to t = 280 s). We confirmed that this recovery occurred at the daughter centriole by performing a two-colour-3D-SIM-FRAP experiment in embryos co-expressing Sas-4-GFP and Asl-mCherry, as Asl forms a toroid around only the mother centrioles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, t = \u221230 s) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Novak et al., 2014</a>). Strikingly, the recovering Sas-4-GFP fluorescence always lay outside of the Asl-mCherry toroid (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, t = 300 s), whereas control unbleached centrosomes still contained two Sas-4-GFP foci, one of which lay inside the Asl-mCherry toroid (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, t = 300 s). This suggested that new Sas-4 molecules are recruited only to the daughter centrioles. However, during acquisition centrosomes move in the x-y plane, and given that the green and red channels are acquired sequentially on this particular imaging system it is possible for the green and red signals to become misaligned. To be sure the recovering Sas-4-GFP signal represented the daughter centriole, rather than a mis-positioned mother centriole, we therefore measured the distance between the centre of the Asl-mCherry signal and the centres of the pre- and post-bleached Sas-4-GFP signals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). This revealed that the average position of the post-bleached Sas-4-GFP signal closely matched the position of the daughter Sas-4-GFP signal, but not the mother Sas-4-GFP signal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), confirming that Sas-4 molecules are recruited only to daughter centrioles. As Asl molecules are known to turn over at the mother centriole at this stage in the cycle (<a href=\"#bib18\">Novak et al., 2014</a>), their recruitment cannot occur as part of Sas-4 dependent S-CAP complexes."

In support of this conclusion, previous reports have shown that centrioles in <i>Drosophila</i> cells lacking cytosolic Sas-4 can recruit PCM during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib21\">Stevens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Riparbelli and Callaini, 2011</a>), and this also appears to be true in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> embryos (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kirkham et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Leidel and G\u00f6nczy, 2003</a>) and in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, SPD-2 and SPD-5, the likely functional homologues of Spd-2 and Cnn, exist mostly as monomers in the cytosol of <i>C. elegans</i> embryos and do not detectably interact with Sas-4 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Wueseke et al., 2014</a>). Thus, the mechanism of mitotic PCM assembly in flies, worms and human cells does not appear to involve the pre-assembly of Sas-4-dependent cytosolic PCM complexes. Importantly, Sas-4 may have a more indirect role in mitotic PCM assembly in fly embryos as centriolar Sas-4 (as opposed to cytoplasmic Sas-4) is required to efficiently recruit Asl molecules around maturing mother centrioles (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dzhindzhev et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Novak et al., 2014</a>), and Asl has an important role in recruiting Spd-2 and Cnn around mother centrioles (<a href=\"#bib4\">Conduit et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2014a</a>)."

Images shown are maximum intensity projections of 5 z-slices taken 0.5 \u03bcm apart. Photobleaching of individual centrosomes was carried out using a combination of a focussed 440 nm laser and a focussed 568 nm laser. ImageJ was used to calculate the distance between the centre points of the recovering green and red signals at 60 s post photobleaching. The images were first scaled up fivefold so that each pixel was divided into 5 \u00d7 5 pixels\u2014this allowed a more accurate analysis. The X; Y location of the centre of mass of each signal was calculated by thresholding the image and running the \u2018analyze particles\u2019 (centre of mass) macro on the most central Z plane of the centrosome. To adjust for any residual shift in the green and red channels, we calculated the average distance and direction between the \u2018green\u2019 and \u2018red\u2019 signals coming from subresolution TetraSpeck beads (Life Technologies, United Kingdom) (total of 977 beads analysed from 12 images) and used this to correct the centrosome data for any microscope-induced channel misalignment; the green and red signals from the beads were offset by a distance of 0.058 \u03bcm \u00b1 0.005 \u03bcm. Once corrected, we calculated the distance between the centres of the green and red signals from each centrosome, and then calculated an average distance from all the centrosomes."

Using the previously calculated centre of mass of each signal, concentric rings (spaced at 0.028 \u03bcm and spanning across 3.02 \u03bcm) were centred and the average fluorescence around each ring was measured (radial profiling). After subtracting the average cytosolic signal and normalising so the peak intensity of the image was equal to 1, we mirrored the profiles to show a full symmetric centrosomal profile. For each profile, an average distribution from at least 10 centrosomes was calculated. The green and red profiles were plotted on the same graph after manually taking into account the previously calculated average distance between the centre of each signal."

Spherical aberration was minimized by matching the refractive indices (1.514) of the immersion oil to the sample. 3D-SIM image stacks consisting of 6 z-planes were acquired with 5 phases, 3 angles per image plane and a distance of 0.125 \u03bcm between planes. The raw data was computationally reconstructed with SoftWorx 6.1 (GE Healthcare) using Wiener filter settings 0.006 and channel specific optical transfer functions.

The Sas-4-GFP construct appears to rescue the sas-4<sup>2214</sup> mutant phenotype when expressed from the endogenous promoter, as the flies are fertile and coordinated (<a href=\"#bib18\">Novak et al., 2014</a>). The embryos were dechorionated using 60% bleach, washed thoroughly with 0.05% Tween-20 in distilled water, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Centrosome free extracts were prepared by homogenising the frozen embryos in 2 ml per gram IP buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1\u00d7 Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) and centrifuging twice at 15,000 RCF. The extract was maintained at 4\u00b0C during preparation. Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were covalently coupled to rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (this study) using the BS<sup>3</sup> crosslinker (ThermoScientific). The amount of antibody-bead conjugate required to pull out most Sas-4-GFP from the extract was calculated empirically, and equal amounts were used for both Sas-4-GFP and wild-type extracts. Before adding the beads to the lysates, a 10 \u03bcl \u2018input\u2019 sample was collected from the extracts and mixed with 10 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer. The beads were added and the reaction was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C by rotation. At the end of the incubation, a magnet was used to separate the beads from the extract and a 10 \u03bcl \u2018unbound\u2019 sample was collected and mixed with 10 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer. The \u2018input\u2019 and \u2018unbound\u2019 samples were of the same volume to ensure that the protein levels in each sample could be directly compared. The beads were washed by re-suspension in PBT three times at room temperature, then washed a further five times with PBT for 10 min by rotation at 4\u00b0C. The beads were then boiled for 10 min in 50 \u03bcl Laemmli sample buffer to produce a \u2018bound\u2019 sample. 10 \u03bcl of each sample was run on a 3\u20138% Tris-Acetate NuPAGE gel (Life Technologies), western blotted and probed for Sas-4, Cnn, Asl, D-PLP, and \u03b3-tubulin using appropriate antibodies: Primary antibodies: N-terminal rabbit anti-Sas-4 antibodies; N-terminal rabbit anti-Cnn antibodies; C-terminal rabbit anti-Asl antibodies; C-terminal rabbit anti-D-PLP antibodies; mouse anti \u03b3-tubulin antibodies (Sigma); mouse anti-actin (Sigma). Secondary antibodies: HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Roche). SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific) was used as a chemiluminescent HRP substrate."

The authors begin by investigating the centrosomal recruitment of Sas-4, Cnn or Spd-2 in <i>Drosophila</i> syncytial embryos. Using two color FRAP experiments, in combination with 3D-SIM FRAP experiments, the authors find that Sas-4 is only recruited to growing daughter centrioles during S-phase and that Cnn and Spd-2 molecules are recruited to mother centrioles in the absence of Sas-4 during mitosis. Finally, the authors use biochemical means to immunopurify S-CAP complexes which have been proposed to contain molecules like Spd-2, Cnn, Asl and Sas-4 and have been proposed to be preassembled protein complexes recruited to centrioles using Sas-4 as a centriole targeting factor. Surprisingly, the authors using well controlled experiments show that preassembled S-CAP complexes are not prominent in these extracts and in combination with the FRAP experiments unlike to be recruited as functional unit to centrioles during the cell cycle."

The work presented here by Conduit and colleagues also challenges the existence of S-CAP complexes, which were proposed, with arguably some surprise, in 2011 in a Nature Communication article by Gopalakrishnan and colleagues to be large cytoplasmic complexes containing several centrosome proteins recruited en masse to the centrosome during its assembly. This study is therefore timely and of broad interest to the field of centrosome biogenesis and function and to a broader extent, based on the methods used to the larger field of cell biology.

Furthermore, the details relating to the 3D-SIM imaging are a little bit scant and would need to be bolstered prior to publication. For example, what was the S/N used, etc.? I do not doubt their results (nor would their conclusions be affected by minor reconstruction artifacts), but I would encourage the authors to add further details on their 3D-SIM imaging and image reconstruction protocols."

Centriole duplication occurs in a series of steps that have been well characterized at the molecular and latterly also structural level. Sas-4 (also known as CPAP/CENPJ in vertebrates) functions in this pathway at one of the later steps, the formation of the centriolar microtubule wall. Sas-4 has also been implicated in PCM assembly, largely on the basis of its presence in complexes (\u2018S-CAP complexes\u2019) with key pericentriolar material proteins in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">2012</a>). Here, Conduit and co-workers re-examine the role of Sas-4 in PCM recruitment in the same experimental model. Based on distinct patterns of recruitment observed by high-resolution microscopy, the authors conclude that PCM proteins are not recruited to centrosomes as part of S-CAP complexes and that cytoplasmic Sas-4 is therefore not directly involved in PCM recruitment."

Further, as discussed below Sas-4 may still interact with PCM components in the context of the centriolar wall, something the manuscript does not address. It is therefore not clear to me that this work makes a significant enough contribution to our understanding of either Sas-4 function or PCM assembly to merit publication in <i>eLife</i>."

This indeed runs counter to the idea of cytoplasmic Sas-4-containing \u2018S-CAP\u2019 complexes functioning in PCM assembly. However, the best evidence against such a role for Sas-4 is the complete lack of a PCM phenotype in Sas-4-depletions, as reported already in the very first studies on this protein in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kirkham et al., 2003</a>; Leidel et al., 2003) and in numerous other studies since, as also mentioned by the authors in the concluding paragraph."

However, the result comes as no surprise. We know at the very least from the original super-resolution studies in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Mennella et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Fu and Glover, 2012</a>) that PCM proteins including Cnn and Spd-2, but also Asl, localize exclusively around the mother centriole. We also know that Sas-4 on mother centrioles is stably incorporated and does not exchange with the cytoplasmic pool, while daughter centrioles incorporate Sas-4 during S phase (Leidel et al., 2003; <a href=\"#bib18\">Novak et al., 2014</a>).

A negative result is always difficult to interpret, even if the authors were to present a positive control (i.e. a protein that does interact with Sas-4 under their conditions). Furthermore, \u2018S-CAP\u2019 complexes could represent only a small fraction of the total Cnn or \u03b3-tubulin population, without invalidating the original model of Gopalakrishnan and co-workers."

It is unclear how such interactions could be detected in cytoplasmic extracts, but there is thus a plausible explanation for at least some of the original findings without invoking a direct, coordinated recruitment of Sas-4 with PCM components."

In the paper to which the reviewer refers (<a href=\"#bib18\">Novak et al. 2014</a>) we showed (using a microscope with standard resolution) that an excess of Sas-4 builds up at centrioles during S-phase (when centrosomes are growing in size) and this excess is then gradually lost during mitosis (when centrosomes have reached their full size).

Given how the Reviewer uses the term \u201crecruitment\u201d in point 2 below, we suspect that he/she uses \u201crecruitment\u201d to mean the net accumulation of molecules at the centrosome and \u201cturnover\u201d to mean the exchange of centrosome molecules for cytoplasmic molecules. We agree that our FRAP data does not distinguish between these two phenomena. However, we use the term recruitment to include both of these phenomena (i.e. we count a molecule as being \u201crecruited\u201d to centrosomes every time a molecule is added to centrosomes from the cytoplasm, irrespective of whether this adds a new molecule to the centrosome or if it replaces an existing molecule). We now explicitly define how we use the term recruitment (Results, first paragraph)."

This is not the case, and we believe this confusion arises from our different definitions of recruitment (see above). In our earlier paper we showed that the total number of GFP-Cnn molecules at centrosomes increases during S-phase (for the reviewer this is \u201crecruitment\u201d) and then stays constant during M-phase (so the reviewer concludes that no recruitment occurs during M-phase). We now show that GFP-Cnn fluorescence recovers after bleaching during both S- and M-phase. Using the reviewers\u2019 definitions, this is due to both recruitment and turnover in S-phase, but only due to turnover in M-phase. However, by our definition, GFP-Cnn molecules are still being recruited to centrosomes during M-phase. Thus, the pattern of GFP-Cnn dynamics in the current study is fully compatible with our earlier analysis. We hope that defining our use of the term \u201crecruitment\u201d helps to clarify this point (Results, first paragraph)."

From these comments we realize that we originally misunderstood the reviewers concern: we thought we needed to address whether the red and green channels were systemically misaligned (which is addressed by the TetraSpeck bead experiment), but the reviewer was actually asking us to address whether the two channels were misaligned because the centrioles have moved slightly during acquisition.

This slight movement does not, however, affect the interpretation of our data. To prove this point, we now measure the distance between the center of the Asl toroid (marking the center of the mother centriole acquired in the red channel) and the center of each Sas-4 dot (marking the center of both the mother and daughter centrioles, acquired in the green channel). Prior to photobleaching, one Sas-4 centriole (the presumptive mother) is on average \u223c80nm from the center of the Asl toroid, while the other (the presumptive daughter) is on average \u223c210nm from the center of the Asl toroid. Thus, the mother centriole shifts by an average of \u223c80nm during the time between acquisition of the two channels. After photobleaching, the Sas-4 signal recovers at an average distance of \u223c260nm from the center of the Asl toroid: statistically, this distance is significantly different from the average distance the mother centriole shifts during acquisition (\u223c80nm) but is not significantly different from the average distance between the Asl toroid and the daughter centriole (\u223c210nm). This new analysis (shown in new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D and 3E</a>) strongly supports our conclusion that Sas-4 is recruited to daughter centrioles rather than mother centrioles."
