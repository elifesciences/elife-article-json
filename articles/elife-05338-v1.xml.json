They allowed us to create a library of 400 GFP-tagged genes. We show that 72% of internally tagged proteins are functional, and that more than 90% can be imaged in unfixed tissues. Moreover, the tagged mRNAs can be knocked down by RNAi against GFP (iGFPi), and the tagged proteins can be efficiently knocked down by deGradFP technology. The phenotypes associated with RNA and protein knockdown typically correspond to severe loss of function or null mutant phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate reversible, spatial, and temporal knockdown of tagged proteins in larvae and adult flies. This new strategy and collection of strains allows unprecedented in vivo manipulations in flies for many genes. These strategies will likely extend to vertebrates."

They allowed us to create a library of 400 GFP-tagged genes. We show that 72% of internally tagged proteins are functional, and that more than 90% can be imaged in unfixed tissues. Moreover, the tagged mRNAs can be knocked down by RNAi against GFP (iGFPi), and the tagged proteins can be efficiently knocked down by deGradFP technology. The phenotypes associated with RNA and protein knockdown typically correspond to severe loss of function or null mutant phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate reversible, spatial, and temporal knockdown of tagged proteins in larvae and adult flies. This new strategy and collection of strains allows unprecedented in vivo manipulations in flies for many genes. These strategies will likely extend to vertebrates."

For example, it is now possible to add a specific DNA sequence to a gene so that the protein it makes will carry a \u2018tag\u2019 that enables us to track it in cells. One such tag is called green fluorescent protein (GFP) and it is often used to study other proteins in living cells because it produces green fluorescence that can be detected under a microscope."

When Minos inserts into a gene, it often disrupts the gene and stops it from working. However, the researchers could swap the inserted transposon for a gene encoding GFP by making use of a natural process that rearranges DNA in cells. This resulted in the protein encoded by the gene containing GFP and so it can be detected under a microscope. This method allowed the researchers to create a collection of fly lines that have the GFP tag on many different proteins."

More than 75% of GFP-tagged proteins worked normally and the flies producing these altered proteins remain healthy. It is possible to use a technique called RNA interference against the GFP to lower the production of the tagged proteins. Moreover, Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al. show that it is also possible to degrade the tagged proteins so that less protein is present. The removal of proteins is reversible and can be done in specific tissues during any phase in fly development. These techniques allow researchers to directly associate the loss of the protein with the consequences for the fly."

Antibodies to individual proteins can be used to localize their expression and for protein interaction studies. However, antibodies are not available for most proteins, and it is time consuming and expensive to generate them against a large number of individual proteins. Although antibodies have been documented against nearly 1900 fly proteins (<a href=\"#bib47\">St Pierre et al., 2014</a>), most have been lost or are not obtainable anymore. An extensive survey reveals that antibodies are currently available against \u223c450 different proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>, a mere \u223c3% of all protein coding genes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams et al., 2000</a>)."

Endogenous tagging of proteins with a fluorescent marker not only provides useful localization data, but may also permit the conditional removal of the gene products. Standard epitope tags such as Flag, HA, V5, GFP and other fluorescent tags allow the use of high-fidelity, commercially available antibodies against these tags, permitting biochemical experiments. Fluorescent tags also facilitate imaging in unfixed tissue or live animals. The most commonly used method of in vivo protein tagging is to introduce a transgene that contains a cDNA with a terminal epitope tag sequence that is expressed using an exogenous promoter (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bischof et al., 2013</a>). Although this may permit the determination of the subcellular localization of the protein, it does not allow assessment of the native expression pattern. It may also affect the distribution and function of the protein, because the transgene is typically not expressed at the endogenous level. An alternative is to tag the genomic locus using a genomic transgene, rather than a cDNA, because native regulatory elements then control the expression patterns and levels (<a href=\"#bib53\">Venken et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ejsmont et al., 2009</a>). This genomic transgene can be integrated by a site-specific integrase into a defined docking site to minimize chromosomal position effects on the expression of the transgene. The tagged genomic transgene allows the analysis of the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of the protein, but does not provide a means to alter the expression of the endogenous copy of the gene. Finally, the most effective and informative strategy is to tag genes in their endogenous locations (<a href=\"#bib55\">Venken et al., 2011b</a>). A large collection of such GFP tagged genes would permit numerous powerful genetic and biochemical applications in addition to determining expression patterns and protein distributions. These include efficient immunoprecipitations with anti-GFP nanoantibody followed by mass spectroscopy (<a href=\"#bib35\">Neum\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>), ChIP sequencing (<a href=\"#bib34\">N\u00e8gre et al., 2011</a>), iGFPi (<a href=\"#bib35\">Neum\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>) and deGradFP mediated protein degradation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Caussinus et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Urban et al., 2014</a>)."

The first such protein trap vectors used <i>P</i>-elements, <i>piggyBacs</i> and <i>piggyBacs</i> with an internal <i>P</i>-element sequence (<a href=\"#bib33\">Morin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Buszczak et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Qui\u00f1ones-Coello et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aleksic et al., 2009</a>). Only a small percentage of the transpositions function as protein traps, because the insertion must be within the intron between two protein-coding exons, as well as being in the right orientation and reading frame to create an in-frame protein fusion when the artificial exon is spliced into the mRNA of the inserted gene. The pooled results of three major efforts (<a href=\"#bib11\">Buszczak et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Qui\u00f1ones-Coello et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aleksic et al., 2009</a>) yielded less than 600 unique genes containing protein traps (<a href=\"#bib42\">Qui\u00f1ones-Coello et al., 2007</a>). Because of the insertion site biases of these transposons, it has been argued that this technology will not allow tagging more than about 5% of the <i>Drosophila</i> genes and that additional screening would yield very few novel tagged genes/proteins; hence, alternative approaches are needed (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aleksic et al., 2009</a>)."

Moreover, MiMIC insertions in coding introns can be efficiently converted using RMCE to label the protein with a GFP or other epitope tag. We have vastly expanded the MiMIC collection, which now totals more than 7400 lines. We show that MiMIC is highly mutagenic and is an extremely efficient tool for gene/protein tagging. We created a new resource of 400 protein tagged genes and show that \u223c72\u201377% of essential genes with internal GFP tags are functional. Importantly, iGFPi and deGradFP permit a temperature-dependent conditional knockdown of gene function that mimics a severe loss of function in specific cells or tissues in most instances. Finally, we document the reversible tissue-specific knockdown of proteins and reversible loss of function of the <i>dunce</i> gene. Hence, the MiMIC protein trap collection is a valuable resource as it allows numerous different applications. The resource and tools described here will allow researchers to address important biological questions, particularly in adult flies, as very limited tools are available to conditionally remove and restore protein function in the adult."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> we selected a total of 2854 MiMIC insertions in coding introns of 1862 distinct genes for inclusion in the GDP collection.

The collection includes 1732 insertions in constitutive coding introns that permit tagging of all annotated protein isoforms (Gold set), 814 insertions in alternative coding introns that permit tagging of more than 50% of annotated protein isoforms (Silver set), and 328 insertions in alternative coding that permit tagging of less than 50% of annotated protein isoforms (Bronze set). Note that 78 of the coding intron insertions map within coding introns of two distinct, overlapping genes. The expanded MiMIC collection also includes insertions in coding exons, untranslated regions, non-coding introns, and putative control regions (within 500 bp of the promoter) of 2860 protein-coding genes and 359 non-coding RNA genes, as well as 1439 intergenic insertions.

To further investigate the efficacy of MiMIC as a gene trap and other important properties of tagged proteins/genes, we characterized 200 genes with intronic MiMIC insertions by tagging with RMCE. To establish whether MiMIC functions as an efficient gene trap when inserted in the proper orientation in a coding intron, and to assess the efficiency of the splice acceptor site (SA) we focused on lethality. Of the 200 genes analyzed, 114 are essential genes based on FlyBase records (<a href=\"#bib47\">St Pierre et al., 2014</a>), 84 are non-essential, and 2 are unknown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The MiMIC insertions in coding introns of 63 of the 114 essential genes are inserted in the correct orientation to function as gene traps, and 58 of these 63 cause homozygous lethality and fail to complement null alleles or deficiencies (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>) that delete the target gene (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>); hence, MiMIC is highly mutagenic. The remaining 51 essential genes have a MiMIC insertion in the non-GT orientation. All these lines are homozygous viable or complement a null allele or a deletion, showing that an intronic MiMIC inserted in the wrong orientation does not significantly disrupt gene function. Note that; 11/51 of the MiMIC-bearing chromosomes are homozygous lethal, but this lethality is caused by second site mutations based on complementation data (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). In summary, our data show that MiMIC functions as designed in 109/114 insertion lines, and is thus a highly reliable gene trap. The data also show that the SA in MiMIC is effective and that the integrated artificial exon is probably not frequently skipped by the pre-mRNA splicing machinery."

When the cassette with the proper reading frame is inserted into a coding intron in the proper orientation, the tag will be spliced into the mRNA of the target gene, and translation of this mRNA will result in a fusion protein with an internal tag inserted. We injected a plasmid DNA containing the donor tag cassette into embryos of \u223c700 MiMIC strains (intronic insertions) expressing phiC31 integrase. We identified G<sub>1</sub> progeny in which the RMCE event had occurred by the loss of the <i>y+</i> marker of the MiMIC gene trap cassette and determined which RMCE events were in the proper orientation using a PCR assay (<a href=\"#bib54\">Venken et al., 2011a</a>).

Of the 88 tagged essential genes that retain protein function, 26 tags are inserted within annotated protein domains and 62 are not inserted within an annotated protein domain (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.0001). However, we found no such bias for internal tags that disrupt essential proteins: 14 tags inserted within annotated domains vs 12 inserted within unannotated sequences (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.7). In summary, insertion of a tag within known, conserved protein domains is more likely to disrupt protein function, and inserting an artificial exon that encodes a tag is effective and not disruptive in 77% of the proteins tested."

To further establish what fraction of the expression patterns could be monitored using unfixed tissue, we compared anti-GFP stained third instar larval brains with unfixed brains in 40 randomly selected lines. We were able to detect expression of EGFP fluorescence in unfixed brains in 38 of 40 lines. Although the expression patterns in each case generally matched the pattern observed by GFP antibody staining (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), the fluorescence intensity is often lower in unfixed tissue.

There are two important advantages of GFP RNAi over gene-specific RNAi: no off-target effects have been documented and a single set of highly selective and efficient GFP shRNAs can be used to knock down the expression of any tagged gene. By using specific GAL4 drivers, knock down of a gene in almost any tissue or stage in developing animals or adults can be achieved (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jenett et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jory et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Manning et al., 2012</a>). Alternatively, a GFP tagged protein can be degraded using the deGradFP system developed by <a href=\"#bib12\">Caussinus et al. (2011)</a>. deGradFP is an ubiquitination-based system in which the F-Box domain of the Slmb protein N-terminus is fused to a single-chain nanoantibody fragment (vhhGFP4) that recognizes the GFP tag. The system uses the host ubiquitination machinery to target GFP-tagged proteins for proteasomal degradation. To compare these two knockdown strategies, we tested four EGFP tagged genes."

The tagged protein is ubiquitously expressed in the eye disc and localizes to adherens junctions as previously reported for \u03b1-Cat (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sarpal et al., 2012</a>). The signals from each antibody colocalize and the tagged \u03b1-Cat protein localizes to the proper intracellular domain, similar to the wild type protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D-a</a>; data not shown). As tagging with RMCE integrates an artificial exon, we determined whether exon skipping occurs. Given that MiMIC functions as an effective gene trap (see above) and since we used the same SA in the EGFP tagging construct (<a href=\"#bib54\">Venken et al., 2011a</a>), we predicted that exon skipping would be rare. However, the integration of a splice donor (SD) in the inserted artificial exon cassette might alter the splicing properties and permit exon skipping. We performed Western blots of adult head extracts of <i>y w</i> and <i>y w; \u03b1-Cat-EGFP-\u03b1-Cat</i> with anti-GFP and anti-\u03b1-Cat antibodies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sarpal et al., 2012</a>).

The 135 kDa band was also observed in the anti-GFP immunoblot (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, right). Hence, we are not able to detect untagged protein in homozygous tagged animals, indicating that the vast majority protein is tagged, but we cannot exclude that some protein in not tagged. This observation is important, as knockdown with iGFPi or deGradFP may be ineffective if exon skipping occurs."

The GAL4 system exhibits some temperature dependency due to the presence of an <i>hsp70</i> promoter upstream of <i>GAL4</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Duffy, 2002</a>). GAL4 is expressed at low levels at 18\u00b0C, while expression is elevated at 28\u00b0C. We tested this and show that with the <i>act-GAL</i><i>4</i> driver, the temperature sensitive expression of GAL4 is quite pronounced (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We therefore wondered whether we could use temperature to modulate the GFP tag-mediated knockdown efficiency. To test this, we ubiquitously expressed deGradFP using <i>act-GAL4</i> in flies expressing \u03b1-Cat-EGFP-\u03b1-Cat and maintained the cultures at 18\u00b0C or 28\u00b0C.

Animals were raised at 28\u00b0C to enhance the GAL4 expression level. Both knockdown experiments cause a rough eye phenotype: however iGFPi results in a more severe phenotype (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D-b</a>). Knockdown with deGradFP causes rough eyes similar to one previously reported RNAi phenotype (<a href=\"#bib44\">Seppa et al., 2008</a>) and knockdown using the \u03b1-Cat specific RNAi, FBst0033430 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2-a</a>), but is less severe than other two unpublished RNAi phenotypes (FBst0038987 and FBst0038197), both of which are pupal lethal when raised at 28\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2-b\u2013c</a>).

The <i>y w dlg1-EGFP-dlg1;UAS-deGradFP/tub-GAL4</i> flies raised at 18\u00b0C develop normally and eclose without obvious phenotype. Moreover, GFP expression is not affected in third instar larvae (data not shown). In contrast, embryos that are raised continuously at 28\u00b0C are embryonic lethal, an earlier lethal phase than <i>dlg1</i> null mutants, which are third instar lethal. However, in zygotic null mutants, there is a large maternal component of Dlg1 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Woods and Bryant, 1991</a>), and germ line clones of <i>dlg1</i> null alleles are embryonic lethal (<a href=\"#bib40\">Perrimon, 1988</a>), suggesting that the maternally deposited protein is degraded in <i>y w dlg1-EGFP-dlg1; UAS-deGradFP/tub-GAL4</i> animals grown at 28\u00b0C. Furthermore, animals that are shifted to 28\u00b0C as either first or second instar larvae display hyperproliferative imaginal disc and brain phenotypes as third instar larvae (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a>). In these animals, we also observe a significant decrease in Dlg1-EGFP-Dlg1 expression in the brain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D-c\u2013e</a>) and in the wing disc (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) compared with controls. We also detect a mild decrease in NMJ growth in terms of bouton number and synapse complexity in the temperature shifted animals compared to unshifted controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D-a,d</a>-white arrows, data not shown), consistent with <i>dlg1</i> loss of function (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>). However, the decrease in Dlg1-EGFP-Dlg1 in the muscle is far less robust compared with other tissues, such as the brain, because the Tubulin driver leads to stronger expression in the brain compared to third instar larval muscles (data not shown). In addition to hyperproliferation, <i>y w dlg1-EGFP-dlg1; UAS-deGradFP/tub-GAL4</i> animals shifted to 28\u00b0C as first instar larvae, much like <i>dlg1</i> zygotic mutants, also have defects in cell morphology and organization as observed in the larval midgut compared to animals raised at 18\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, these data show that deGradFP not only prevents zygotic expression of Dlg1, but also eliminates maternal deposited Dlg1, thus recapitulating phenotypes associated with zygotic null mutations and the lethality associated with mutant germ line clones."

The spatial protein distributions of the tagged isoforms are not affected in Brp-EGFP-Brp as a comparison of anti Brp and anti GFP staining patterns in the L3 brain and NMJs shows that the signals co-localize in the third instar neuropil and at the active zones in the NMJs, and the localization is similar or identical to published data (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

The majority of animals raised continuously at 28\u00b0C and expressing deGradFP or iGFPi die as embryos or first instar larvae. Similarly, animals shifted to 28\u00b0C as first instar larvae (L1) die in late second instar (L2). However, later shifts show major differences between animals expressing deGradFP vs iGFPi: iGFPi animals shifted to 28\u00b0C as L2 larvae or adults show no obvious phenotypes, whereas deGradFP animals shifted as L2 larvae or adults show locomotor defects and die as pupae (L2 shifted) or adults (L2 or adult shifted). Moreover, temperature shifts to 28\u00b0C in adults allow flies to live for approximately 4 weeks after the shift. These data suggest that iGFPi is not as efficient as deGradFP at some stages of development or in some tissues, possibly because the Brp protein has a very long half-life and is less affected by depletion of mRNA levels by iGFPi than by degradation of the protein by deGradFP."

A reversible knockdown has numerous advantages: it is quick, simple and only requires temperature shifts; it can be performed during development and in adult flies of any age; it allows the unambiguous assignment of the phenotype to the protein knockdown; it obviates the need of control genotypes; and it determines if damage to cells upon loss of a protein is reversible or permanent. We therefore tested if we were able to reversibly knock down and regenerate the proper expression pattern and protein distribution for a few tagged genes. We selected two proteins with a large extacellular domain, Roughest (<i>rst</i>) and NetrinA (<i>NetA</i>). The EGFP is inserted in the large extracellular domain of Rst and NetA. We were able to remove and re-establish protein expression and proper distribution of Roughest and NetrinA in third instar larval brains (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Both Rst and NetA have distinct expression patterns in the larval brain which are significantly reduced after 24 hr at the restrictive temperature, 28\u00b0C. However, when larvae are returned to the permissive temperature, 18\u00b0C, for 24 hr, protein expression is restored to a level comparable to larvae that were never exposed to the restrictive temperature (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Therefore, through temperature manipulation, GAL4, and subsequently deGradFP expression can be controlled to reversibly disrupt target protein expression level. Given that GFP is in the extracellular domain, the degradation of these proteins must occur efficiently during protein synthesis."

                                "text": "To correlate the removal of a protein with a behavioral assay, we tagged the Dunce protein via RMCE using MI03415 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). <i>dunce</i> (<i>dnc</i>) encodes a cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) that is required for learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib14\">Davis and Kiger, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Qiu et al., 1991</a>). The EGFP cassette exon is positioned to tag all but one protein isoform (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). The Dnc-EGFP-Dnc protein is expressed in the adult brain and is mostly restricted to mushroom bodies (MB), the center for learning and memory in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). A more detailed analysis reveals that the fusion protein is expressed in all MB lobes (\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032, \u03b2, \u03b2\u2032 and \u03b3) in the adult brain (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), and the GFP staining reveals a much crisper expression pattern than the anti Dunce antibody (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nighorn et al., 1991</a>). To knock down Dnc we used the <i>117y-GAL4</i> driver (<a href=\"#bib4\">Armstrong et al., 1998</a>) which is expressed in MBs (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The <i>dnc-EGFP-dnc;117y-GAL4/+;UAS-deGradFP/+</i> flies were raised at 18\u00b0C. 1 day after eclosion, the flies were transferred to 28\u00b0C for 3 days, and then returned to 18\u00b0C for 2 days. We observe a progressive loss of Dnc-EGFP-Dnc, and after 48 hr at 28\u00b0C we could not or barely detect the tagged protein (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Protein expression is restored 48 hr after a shift back to 18\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). To determine whether the decrease in Dnc-EGFP-Dnc expression levels correlates with a known behavioral phenotype associated with loss of <i>dnc</i>, we performed the aversive olfactory learning assay (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tully and Quinn, 1985</a>). As expected, the <i>dnc</i> mutant flies, <i>dnc</i><sup>1</sup>/<i>dnc</i><sup>1</sup>, <i>dnc</i><sup>1</sup>/<i>dnc</i><sup>ML</sup> and <i>dnc</i><sup>1</sup>/<i>dnc</i><sup>M14</sup> (all partial loss of function combinations of <i>dnc</i> alleles) exhibit a 50% reduction in performance index when compared to <i>dnc</i><sup>1</sup>/+, <i>y w</i>, Canton-S, and <i>dnc-EGFP-dnc</i> flies (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013E</a>). In contrast, <i>dnc</i>-<i>EGFP</i>-<i>dnc</i> flies expressing deGradFP under the control of the MB specific driver and maintained at 28\u00b0C for 3 days exhibit a performance index that is decreased by 70%, similar to the most severe <i>dunce</i> alleles (<a href=\"#bib14\">Davis and Kiger, 1981</a>). The same flies were then returned to 18\u00b0C, Dnc-EGFP-Dnc expression in MB was re-established within 24 hr, and the learning phenotype was recovered fully within 48 hr. Hence, deGradFP is able to reversibly alter protein expression levels. In addition to reestablishing Dnc-EGFP-Dnc expression, the learning score is reestablished after 2 days at 18\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). These data indicate that combining MiMIC-based EGFP tagging, <i>UAS-deGradFP</i> and <i>GAL4</i> drivers allows us to achieve not only spatial and temporal control of protein expression, but to do so in a reversible manner, in order to reduce and then restore gene function in live flies."

These data demonstrate that the selected SA (Splice Acceptor) in the MiMIC element, also used in the tagging cassette, is highly efficient and minimizes exon skipping. This is also corroborated by the fact that we only observe the predicted tagged isoforms in three genes that were tested by Western blotting: <i>\u03b1-Cat, dlg1</i>, and <i>brp</i>. This minimal level of exon skipping permits robust knockdown of the transcripts and proteins encoded by these genes using iGFPi and deGradFP (see below)."

First, EGFP expression can be detected in CNS of 90% of tagged genes. This is a surprisingly high number as it shows that most genes are expressed at sufficiently high levels to be detected with EGFP in their endogenous context. Second, intronic tagging does not obviously disrupt protein function in 77% of the 114 cases examined. This is also a surprisingly high portion of genes and is possibly due to the presence of unstructured linkers on either side of the tag. Third, expression of EGFP can be imaged in unfixed tissues in more than 90% of the samples tested. Note that this percentage has steadily risen during our project and the use of better confocal scopes has dramatically improved these numbers. The latter data are important as they document that most genes are expressed at levels that should permit direct imaging of GFP fluorescence in live tissue. These features make the collection very valuable and useful for many different applications."

Both strategies appear to be efficient during development. RNAi expressed in the zygote is unlikely to remove the maternal proteins deposited in the egg, but they are removed or strongly reduced by deGradFP in the case of <i>dlg1</i>. deGradFP is more efficient than the iGFPi system, except with knockdown of <i>\u03b1-Cat</i> in eyes where iGFPi exhibits a more robust phenotype. In contrast, for Brp-EGFP-Brp, RNAi knockdown causes similar phenotypes to deGradFP in embryogenesis and first instar larvae, but iGFPi leads to milder or no phenotypes at later stages, especially when the temperature shifts are performed in adults. These results suggest that the Brp protein is stable in adults and that the deGradFP system is able to target and disrupt Brp function, although it takes much longer to achieve than in embryos or larvae. In summary, both knockdown strategies should be explored when possible."

However, the temperature induced protein knockdowns that we observe take significantly longer. In the case of Brp-EGFP-Brp it takes at least 12 hr to observe a significant reduction in protein expression level in third instar larvae. Strong reductions in expression and a severe loss of synaptic transmission are observed 18 hr after a temperature shift in third instar larvae. For Dnc-EGFP-Dnc protein, we observe a severe knock down after 24 hr in adults, but it takes 48 hr at 28\u00b0C to observe a near complete loss of the protein in the mushroom bodies. In contrast to Brp-EFP-Brp and Dlg1-EGFP-Dlg1 where knockdown in adults can take up to 3 weeks or longer at 28\u00b0C to exhibit a severe phenotype. Yet, a ubiquitous adult knockdown with <i>actin-GAL4</i> driving UAS-deGradFP for \u03b1-Cat, WASp and Bifid (optomotorblind) results in lethality within a few days (data not shown). These observations suggest that differences in developmental stage, tissue, GAL4 strength and temperature will alter the dynamics of protein degradation with the deGradFP system leading to variation from protein to protein. As an additional note, we have observed that knockdown efficiency during developmental experiments is greatly enhanced when GAL4 is maternally deposited, by using GAL4 driver virgins."

Given that allelic series have been shown to be extremely valuable in genetic studies, important biological information can be derived by varying the knockdown conditions, providing tremendous flexibility for in vivo analyses. While <i>Drosophila</i> is recognized as being one of the premier model organisms for the genetic analysis of gene function, one limitation has been the difficulty of conditionally knocking down genes or proteins in adults, especially in the adult nervous system. To achieve this goal, typically a complex set of reagents needs to be created, even with the simplest designs. These include a null or severe loss of function mutation, a UAS-cDNA rescue construct, a ubiquitously expressed GAL4 driver to rescue the mutation, and a GAL80<sup>ts</sup> construct to conditionally inactivate the GAL4 (<a href=\"#bib31\">McGuire et al., 2003</a>). Using the library described here, we can now design large genetic screens in which we knock down proteins systematically in specific adult neurons or other tissues. The reversibility of the phenotype associated with the loss (28\u00b0C) and restoration (18\u00b0C) of the protein provide an important advantage as they permit us to directly pinpoint the cause of the phenotype, as well as the identity of the tissue that underlies the phenotype, as illustrated by the reversible MB-specific knockdown of the Dnc-EGFP-Dnc protein."

A detailed protocol is available on the GDP website (<a href=\"http://flypush.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu/pscreen/\">http://flypush.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu/pscreen/</a>). Lines were selected for inclusion in the GDP collection by reviewing each insertion site with respect to annotated genes and the sites of other MiMIC insertions that were already part of the selected collection. Any insertion that was the first MiMIC hit in a gene was selected. When there were multiple insertions within a gene, priority was given to insertions within coding introns, coding exons, and introns in the 5\u2032 UTR. Insertions within a coding intron or exon shared by the most annotated transcript isoforms were selected when possible. Multiple insertions were often selected for a gene if they hit different parts of the gene (e.g., one insertion in a coding intron and one in a coding exon) or if they provided a way of differentially tagging multiple annotated protein isoforms. We selected one insertion line in each of several tandemly repeated gene families (e.g., the histone and 5S rRNA genes), even though we could not localize the insertion to a unique copy within the tandem array. One of the goals of the MiMIC screen was to create an array of MiMIC insertions throughout the genome, spaced no more than 40 kb apart (<a href=\"#bib54\">Venken et al., 2011a</a>). Toward this end, we selected intergenic MiMIC insertions if they were inserted &gt;20 kb from other MiMICs already in the collection. The <i>attP</i> sites of intergenic MiMICs can facilitate targeted mutagenesis of nearby genes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wesolowska and Rong, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib58a\">2013</a>) and other genome engineering applications (<a href=\"#bib52\">Venken and Bellen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bateman et al., 2013</a>).

This study by Bellen and colleagues describes an expanded resource of MiMIC insertions that can be of multiple use to the fly community. Technologically, it is a follow-up from earlier work (Venken, 2011, Nat Met) using the same technology, however providing lager numbers and showing additional applications. As a proof of principle, the authors tag 400 genes with a EGFP tag and provide evidence that incorporation of the tag generally does not interfere with protein function. The authors then show how the EGFP tag can be used with GFP-RNAi and deGrad-FP to knockdown tagged mRNAs and proteins. Lastly, they demonstrate the utility of the MiMIC lines by providing three examples of how these reagents can be used to genetically dissect gene function in the nervous system."

FBst0033430, causes rough eyes and reduction in eye size that is comparable to deGradFP knockdown of alpha-Cat-EGFP. This is in agreement with the only RNAi knockdown of \u03b1-Cat in the eye published by Ulrich Tepass and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib44\">Seppa et al., 2008</a>). The other two, FBst0038987 and FBst0038197, cause pupal lethality with little or no head development. However, no data are available related to the specificity of these RNAis.
