This process generates highly branched arrays of filaments that grow toward the membrane to which they are tethered, a conflict that seemingly would restrict filament growth. Using three-color single-molecule imaging in vitro we revealed how the dynamic associations of Arp2/3 complex with mother filament and WASP are temporally coordinated with initiation of daughter filament growth. We found that WASP proteins dissociated from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex prior to new filament growth. Further, mutations that accelerated release of WASP from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex proportionally accelerated branch formation. These data suggest that while WASP promotes formation of pre-nucleation complexes, filament growth cannot occur until it is triggered by WASP release. This provides a mechanism by which membrane-bound WASP proteins can stimulate network growth without restraining it."

This process generates highly branched arrays of filaments that grow toward the membrane to which they are tethered, a conflict that seemingly would restrict filament growth. Using three-color single-molecule imaging in vitro we revealed how the dynamic associations of Arp2/3 complex with mother filament and WASP are temporally coordinated with initiation of daughter filament growth. We found that WASP proteins dissociated from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex prior to new filament growth. Further, mutations that accelerated release of WASP from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex proportionally accelerated branch formation. These data suggest that while WASP promotes formation of pre-nucleation complexes, filament growth cannot occur until it is triggered by WASP release. This provides a mechanism by which membrane-bound WASP proteins can stimulate network growth without restraining it."

Cellular actin filaments can grow by adding new actin molecules, and actin filaments can also have \u2018branches\u2019 that fork out from the mother filament. Branches grow out of an assembly of seven proteins known as the Arp2/3 complex, which attaches to the side of the mother filament. Branch growth is triggered by binding to the Arp2/3 complex of an additional protein, WASP, but the sequence of events required to initiate a new branch is not well understood. In particular, WASP is bound to cell membranes; at some point it must detach from the Arp2/3 complex so that the nearness of the membrane does not interfere with the growth of branches. Now, Smith et al. uncover how branch formation is triggered, and define a new role played by WASP in this process."

However, new branches did not form unless the VCA-domain pair detached from the actin filament, leaving the Arp2/3 complex behind. Additionally, Smith et al. found that mutant VCA-domain pairs detached from the actin filament at different rates, which then determined the chance that a new branch formed."

The WASP proteins then release the filament, and only then does the Arp2/3 complex initiate the formation of an actin branch. Since the Arp2/3 complex is no longer attached to WASP, subsequent growth of the branch is not physically limited by linkage to the membrane."

The Actin related protein 2/Actin related protein 3 (Arp2/3) complex nucleates new (<i>daughter</i>) filaments from the sides of existing (<i>mother</i>) filaments in response to activating stimulus from the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) family (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pollard, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Campellone and Welch, 2010</a>). Membrane-associated WASP proteins integrate upstream signals and activate Arp2/3 complex in the correct place and time to produce actin structures that perform a variety of cellular functions including motility. The verprolin homology-central-acidic (VCA) domain of WASP family proteins binds to monomeric actin and the Arp2/3 complex, and is both necessary and sufficient for the WASP proteins to stimulate nucleation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Machesky and Insall, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Miki and Takenawa, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Machesky et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rohatgi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pollard, 2007</a>)."

VCA engagement promotes a conformational change in Arp2/3 complex that repositions Arp2 and Arp3 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Robinson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Goley et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rodal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Rouiller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Xu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hetrick et al., 2013</a>). This conformational change is thought to be required to initiate daughter filament growth. Further, the initial monomers of the nucleated filament are delivered by the V region, or WASP homology 2 (WH2) domain (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rohatgi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hertzog et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Irobi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chereau et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Padrick et al., 2011</a>). However, the Arp2/3-VCA-actin complex is not active on its own; an additional stimulus must be provided by the mother filament (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mullins et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Achard et al., 2010</a>). Thus, when stimulated by VCA the Arp2/3 complex only nucleates filaments from the sides of existing filaments. This produces branched filament arrays in vitro (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mullins et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Machesky et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Blanchoin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amann and Pollard, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Achard et al., 2010</a>), which resemble the branched networks found in cells (<a href=\"#bib61\">Svitkina and Borisy, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vinzenz et al., 2012</a>). An additional feature of the system is that simultaneous binding of two VCA peptides to Arp2/3 complex greatly potentiates daughter nucleation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Padrick et al., 2011</a>). It is likely that WASP oligomerization is a broadly used mechanism of activation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Padrick et al., 2008</a>), and a number of cellular factors that dimerize or multimerize WASP have been identified (<a href=\"#bib47\">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</a>)."

It is established that VCA stimulates branch formation by accelerating the association of Arp2/3 complex with the mother filament (<a href=\"#bib59\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). In addition, there is evidence from kinetic analyses that a VCA-dependent \u2018activation step\u2019 follows filament binding during nucleation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Marchand et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zalevsky et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beltzner and Pollard, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). The nature of this step remains unknown but has been hypothesized to arise from conformational changes in the Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Marchand et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beltzner and Pollard, 2008</a>).

In cells, branched filament networks have their barbed ends directed toward membranes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Small et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Svitkina and Borisy, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vinzenz et al., 2012</a>). The characteristic geometry of the branches nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex dictates that both mother and daughter filaments grow toward the membrane. However, WASP proteins are linked with activators on the membrane (<a href=\"#bib47\">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</a>), so that VCA-bound Arp2/3 complex should be tethered to the membrane. This tethering creates a steric problem, in that the growing ends of the filaments are held against, and possibly have their growth limited by, the membrane. However, this problem is eventually resolved (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, right). In lamellipodia, VCA-containing WAVE proteins stay associated with the leading edge, while the Arp2/3 complex is distributed throughout the actin mesh (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lai et al., 2008</a>). In both budding and fission yeasts, Arp2/3 complex is separated from membrane-bound activators during endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kaksonen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sirotkin et al., 2005</a>). Analogously, in propulsive actin \u2018comet tails\u2019 Arp2/3 complex is found throughout the tail while its activators stay (largely) associated with the motile bacterium, virus, or vesicle (<a href=\"#bib66\">Welch et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Egile et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Loisel et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Taunton et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Weisswange et al., 2009</a>). In vitro, branches are released from the budding yeast WASP family member Las17 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Martin et al., 2006</a>). In all of these systems Arp2/3 complex can disengage from the surface attached activator within a short time of the onset of daughter filament growth."

Previous studies have proposed that VCA may dissociate from Arp2/3 complex prior to initiation of daughter filament growth. The observation that ATP hydrolysis by Arp2 decreases affinity for VCA suggested a possible trigger for dissociation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dayel et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dayel and Mullins, 2004</a>), although hydrolysis was later shown to be dispensable for filament nucleation and to instead control disassembly of the branch (<a href=\"#bib42\">Martin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ingerman et al., 2013</a>). Consideration of biochemical and structural data on WH2-actin interactions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Egile et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Higgs et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hertzog et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Irobi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chereau et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boczkowska et al., 2008</a>) led to speculation that during Arp2/3-mediated nucleation, the WH2 region of VCA may initially block the barbed end of actin delivered to the Arp2 or Arp3 subunit and thus must move or dissociate prior to daughter filament elongation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Padrick et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Ti et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hetrick et al., 2013</a>). However, direct observation of the sequence of molecular events associated with the initiation of daughter filament growth and the release of VCA has been lacking."

Here we used three-color single molecule fluorescence experiments to directly visualize the sequence and rates of the key steps in the pathway through which VCA dimers, Arp2/3 complexes, and actin filaments associate with one another and generate a new actin branch. The work reveals that the activation step in nucleation is likely the release of VCA dimers from the nascent branch, such that VCA dissociation is the trigger for daughter filament growth. The problem of filament growth against a membrane to which it is tethered is therefore solved by a mechanism in which release from the membrane tether is required for filament initiation."

During this process, single molecules of Arp2/3 complex and diVCA were observed to bind together to locations on filament sides (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a> at <i>t</i> = 0; <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In nearly all cases (83 \u00b1 9% S.E., based on 877 Arp2/3 complex observations), Arp2/3 complex and diVCA arrived simultaneously within the experimental time resolution (0.15 s), indicating that diVCA was bound to Arp2/3 complex prior to filament engagement, and that both proteins bound to filaments as a unit (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The sparse labeling of actin and high fluorescence intensity of mother filaments did not permit us to detect the arrival of actin monomers with VCA and Arp2/3 complex. However, under the reaction conditions (5 nM diVCA and 1 \u03bcM actin), with a <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> of diVCA for actin of \u223c300 nM (which is only slightly altered by the presence of Arp2/3 complex, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), we expect \u223c77% of diVCAs to have at least one actin bound. Thus, most of the diVCA-Arp2/3 complexes observed to bind mother filament should contain actin and thus have all the molecular factors needed for nucleation. We hereafter refer to this filament-bound complex as the \u2018nascent branch\u2019, an intermediate in the pathway to daughter filament assembly."

Fits to single site binding isotherms (lines) yielded <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> 70 \u00b1 10 nM, 65 \u00b1 4 nM, and 105 nM \u00b1 15 nM, respectively. Changes in anisotropy are expected to be dominated by the binding of actin, as the fluorophore location is proximal to the N-terminus of the V domain, and away from the Arp2/3 complex binding motifs. Increased fluorescence anisotropy in the presence of both Arp2/3 complex and actin indicates that both species can bind simultaneously."

A merit of the single-molecule approach is that we could characterize these rare productive events (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>) independently of the excess of non-productive events. In the productive events, Arp2/3 complex and diVCA release were not simultaneous. There was no evidence that the Arp2/3 complexes which formed branches ever dissociated; the value of \u03c4<sub>3</sub> is set by the photobleaching lifetime of the dye-labeled Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib59\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, diVCA dissociated rapidly (typically in &lt;1 s) from the productive Arp2/3-diVCA-filament complexes. Consistent with this observation, the on-filament lifetime distribution of diVCA lacks a long component (\u03c4<sub>3</sub>) that is present in the on-filament lifetime distribution of Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> at time &gt; approximately 4 s).

These filament initiation times were then compared to the times of diVCA release from the same nascent branch. Filament initiation time measurements were imprecise because of the uncertainties inherent in measuring daughter filaments of sub-micrometer lengths. Nevertheless, within this experimental uncertainty we observed that the initiation of daughter filament growth always occurred at or after the time of diVCA release (41 observations; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This was true even in the comparatively rare cases in which diVCA persisted on the nascent branch for times &gt;1 s before dissociating. Taken together, these data suggest that the daughter filament cannot initiate unless and until VCA is released from the nascent branch. Thus, diVCA release may serve as the trigger for daughter growth."

To address this question, we tethered individual dye- and biotin-labeled Arp2/3 complexes to the microscope slide and visualized the binding of freely diffusing diVCA and (non-biotinylated) actin filaments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Most of the tethered Arp2/3 complexes (&gt;80%) were observed to bind diVCA.

For wild-type diVCA and all three mutants, we observed repeated association and dissociation of the diVCA molecules with surface-tethered Arp2/3 complex (e.g., <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These events allowed measurement of the lifetime distributions for the diVCA bound and dissociated states of Arp2/3 complex, and thus determination of the binding and dissociation rate constants. The mutations had only modest effects, at most 2.7-fold, on the rate of binding of diVCA to Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The dissociation rates varied over a wide range, with the A* mutant dissociating from Arp2/3 complex more slowly than wild-type, and the V* and C* mutants dissociating more rapidly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Both wild-type and mutant complexes displayed lifetime distributions that were fit well with two exponential components (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), indicating that at least two distinct diVCA-Arp2/3 complex assemblies or conformations were present. In a more detailed analysis with the V* mutant, we saw no evidence that the short and long lifetime components segregated into different subpopulations of individual Arp2/3 complexes. These observations suggest even individual diVCA-Arp2/3 complexes participated in multiple states. The presence of multiple different complexes is consistent with previous observations including that Arp2/3 complex has two (or more) binding sites for VCA (<a href=\"#bib45\">Padrick et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Ti et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Xu et al., 2012</a>), and that alternative conformations of Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Goley et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rodal et al., 2005</a>) may have different affinities for VCA."

The V* and C* mutants were more potent than wild-type (p=0.018 and 0.053, respectively), stimulating nucleation 10 \u00b1 3-fold and 6 \u00b1 3-fold. Conversely, the A* mutant was less potent than wild-type (p=0.040), stimulating only 1.4 \u00b1 0.4 fold.

As expected, all three diVCAs were able to promote nucleation from the sides of existing filaments. More importantly, the mutant diVCA constructs shared with wild-type the key molecular behaviors discussed previously. Like wild-type, mutant diVCA constructs released from the nascent branch prior to initiation of the daughter filament (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and did not bind to Arp2/3 complex after the branch formed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>; this later behavior could not be verified for the A* mutant because of its low activity in the experiments using tethered Arp2/3 complexes). Overall, these results suggest that the mutant constructs stimulate Arp2/3 complex by the same mechanism as wild-type. Moreover, the rank order of the diVCA construct nucleation activities was identical in the single-molecule measurements of the rate of branch formation observed on existing filaments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and in bulk measurements of concentration of filaments generated in solution (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, the mutants provide a range of activities both above and below wild-type that can be seen in both experimental modes, and the mechanism by which the mutants stimulate branch formation appears to be identical to wild-type."

Taken together with earlier work, the data support a specific mechanism for diVCA-stimulated actin nucleation by Arp2/3 complex in which diVCA plays a dual role (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Initially, diVCA stimulates assembly of the nascent branch by associating tightly with Arp2/3 complex and actin monomers, which promotes the binding of Arp2/3 complex to the sides of filaments. However, once the nascent branch forms, diVCA plays an inhibitory role: diVCA must dissociate before daughter filament can grow. In mutants that alter the interactions of diVCA with Arp2/3 complex or monomeric actin, alterations of the rate at which diVCA leaves the nascent branch exactly parallel changes in the efficiency of branch formation. These observations strongly suggest that diVCA dissociation is the key, rate-limiting step in daughter filament nucleation."

Data on dimeric VCA showing a minimum crosslinker length for high activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Padrick et al., 2011</a>) strongly suggests that the system passes through a form with two VCAs bound at some point during nucleation. The crosslinkers and spacer sequences used here allow a maximum VCA separation of 122 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Padrick et al., 2011</a>). During Arp2/3 complex activation in diverse contexts in living cells, WASP family proteins are separated by similar or even smaller distances. For example, when dimerized by activators such as EspFu, the WASP protein VCA regions would be \u223c80 \u00c5 apart if the proline rich region is considered as a random coil polymer (<a href=\"#bib46\">Padrick et al., 2008</a>). Similarly, ActA density on the surface of <i>Listeria</i> separates its VCA-like sequences by 19 nm, close enough to function as VCA dimers (<a href=\"#bib21\">Footer et al., 2008</a>). N-WASP proteins recruited to moving PIP2-rich vesicles have a high local density, such that their average spacing is &lt;50 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Co et al., 2007</a>), and in rocketing vesicles, N-WASP proteins are recruited by Nck onto the vesicle surface such that their average separation is \u223c100 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ditlev et al., 2012</a>). Bzz1 and Cdc15 are the activators of the fission yeast WASP family protein Wsp1 during endocytosis, and they array their SH3 domains (which engage Wsp1) at a density sufficient to bring VCA regions from adjacent Wsp1 proteins within 50\u201380 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</a>)."

This mechanism, derived from direct observation of single molecules as opposed to fitting of bulk data, is broadly consistent with proposed kinetic schemes for Arp2/3 complex nucleation of filaments (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zalevsky et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beltzner and Pollard, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). The dominant pathway is that VCA and actin monomer associate with Arp2/3 complex in solution, and this complex then binds to an existing filament, after which an activation step occurs, which allows the daughter filament to elongate. Here we add two informative points. First, we ascribe a distinct mechanism to the activation step, the release of diVCA. Previously this step had been ascribed to structural rearrangements within the Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dayel et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zalevsky et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beltzner and Pollard, 2008</a>). Second, our measurements indicate that most engagements of diVCA-Arp2/3 complexes with the mother filament are resolved by dissociation of the complex from filament without releasing VCA, an idea distinct from previous models (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beltzner and Pollard, 2008</a>). It is possible that the observed inefficiency in branch formation is to allow for positive regulation of branch formation by factors not present in our experiment (<a href=\"#bib59\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with this idea, cortactin has been recently demonstrated to accelerate release of WASP proteins from Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib25\">Helgeson and Nolen, 2013</a>). Since WASP proteins are tethered to the cell membrane, it is also possible that mechanical tension between the filament network and the membrane plays a similar role in promoting WASP release and consequent daughter growth, which might allow alteration of cell motility in response to mechanical stimuli."

Thus, the molecular structures are consistent with the observed dual function of VCA in both stimulating daughter nucleation (by recruiting actin monomers to Arp2/3 complex) and in suppressing daughter nucleation (by blocking assembly of the daughter filament). These structural models are also consistent with the low affinity of diVCA for branch junctions. If neither the V-region nor the C-region can bind the branch (when the actin and Arp clefts are occupied by D-loops of daughter filament actins), then the affinity of VCA for the branch may be of the order of that observed for isolated A-region. This affinity has been reported to be approximately 9 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#bib41\">Marchand et al., 2001</a>), consistent with the lack of observed binding under the conditions necessary for single molecule observations."

                        "text": "In cells, active WASP proteins are predominantly tethered to membranes. Taken together, our data suggests a straightforward mechanism by which WASP regulation of Arp2/3 complex can cause branches to form preferentially at membranes without having membrane attachment restrict network growth (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Binding of Arp2/3 complex to VCA dimers in the absence of mother filaments is of high affinity and of long lifetime, allowing dimerization of WASP by upstream activators to promote recruitment of Arp2/3 complex to the membrane surface (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, \u2018WASP dimer association with Arp2/3 complex\u2019). Association with VCA promotes filament binding by Arp2/3 complex (\u2018Arp2/3 complex engagement of filament\u2019), but that process is readily reversible and the nascent branch most frequently is simply lost through dissociation (\u2018Filament release\u2019). More rarely, WASP detaches (\u2018WASP release\u2019) leaving Arp2/3 complex associated with the mother filament. This severs the direct linkage to the membrane, and only then allows the daughter filament to nucleate and grow (\u2018Initiation of daughter filament elongation\u2019). Our data show that once the branch forms, WASP does not rebind. The dissociation of WASP prior to nucleation and the lack of rebinding provide an appealing explanation for how WASP dimers stimulate branched network formation at the membrane without interfering with network growth."

For tethered-Arp2/3 experiments, the second order rate constant for diVCA binding was obtained from single-exponential fits to the intervals where tethered-Arp2/3 was unoccupied by diVCA (<i>k</i><sub>V+</sub>; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>), whereas the characteristic lifetimes were obtained from double-exponential fits to the distributions of intervals where tethered-Arp2/3 was occupied by diVCA (\u03c4<sub>V1</sub>, \u03c4<sub>V2</sub>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). There was no evidence that the biexponential distribution of diVCA-Arp2/3 complexes reflects two distinct forms of Arp2/3 complex that do not interconvert on the timescale of our experiment (\u223c30 min). This was assessed for the V* mutant by calculating the fraction of diVCA-V*-Arp2/3 complexes that lasted &lt;10 s for each tethered Arp2/3 complex observed, which showed a single distribution centered at \u223c50%, consistent with the ensemble distribution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). The effect of photobleaching on the apparent dissociation rate of Cy3-diVCA constructs was assessed and corrected by analyzing the dependence of \u03c4<sub>V2</sub> on the excitation laser power (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Laser power was measured by intercepting the beam path between dichroic mirror D3 and mirror M5 (Figure 1 in <a href=\"#bib22\">Friedman et al., 2006</a>). All binding rates and lifetime distributions were corrected for non-specific binding of Arp2/3 complex or diVCA to the microscope slide, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib59\">Smith et al., 2013</a>)."

Coincident arrival of Arp2/3 complex and diVCA was determined if a diVCA appeared within 0.27 \u00b5m (2 pixels) from the location and within 0.15 s (3 frames) of the arrival time of the Arp2/3 complex, given conservative estimates of spatial and temporal resolutions of the frame-averaged dual-channel particle tracking methods. Although we cannot distinguish between coincident arrival and sequential arrival of Arp2/3 complex and diVCA within 0.15 s, we would not expect that diVCA could bind so rapidly after formation of Arp2/3-filament complexes, given the measured rate of binding to Arp2/3 complexes off-filament and the diVCA concentration in solution (\u223c10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> \u00d7 5 nM = \u223c0.5 s<sup>\u22121</sup>). We also corrected the total number of Arp2/3 complexes that appeared on filament sides with and without diVCA by the expected number of Arp2/3-filament encounters missed because they were too transient (lifetime &lt;0.1 s) to be detected. This correction factor (1/p<sub>0</sub>) was calculated using the multi-exponential fits to the Arp2/3-filament lifetime distributions (survival probability p[<i>t</i>]), with and without coincident diVCA, evaluated at the minimum detectible event duration: p<sub>0</sub> = p(0.1 s). This detection efficiency was typically 0.5\u20130.6. The same correction factor was applied to the second order rate constants of filament side binding, <i>k</i><sub>A+</sub>."

Also, the fraction of diVCA-Arp2/3-filament complexes or Arp2/3-filament complexes that nucleated a daughter filament was counted as the branch formation efficiency (<i>f</i><sub>B</sub>) with or without diVCA, respectively. The number of binding and release events in each category (Arp2/3 complex alone, coincident with diVCA, Arp2/3-diVCA co-released, and diVCA release before Arp2/3 complex) were corrected by the number of observations in each category on regions of the field of view that did not contain a filament, so as to correct for non-specific interactions with the microscope slide."

This relation results from the fact that the observed lifetime of the nascent branch intermediate is limited by the combination of the dissociation of diVCA from the filament-bound Arp2/3 complex (proceeds with rate <i>k</i><sub>V\u2212</sub><sup>*</sup>) and the dissociation of diVCA-Arp2/3 complex from the filament (proceeds with rate <i>k</i><sub>A\u2212</sub>), such that \u03c4<sub>V</sub><sup>*</sup> = 1/(<i>k</i><sub>A\u2212</sub> + <i>k</i><sub>V\u2212</sub><sup>*</sup>). The lifetimes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) are very similar for all diVCA constructs because the dissociation of diVCA-Arp2/3 complexes from filament sides is dominant (<i>k</i><sub>A\u2212</sub> &gt;&gt; <i>k</i><sub>V\u2212</sub><sup>*</sup>) and <i>k</i><sub>A\u2212</sub> is not significantly affected by VCA mutations. Note that the proposed mechanism (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) predicts that the nominal lifetime of nascent branches is the same whether we select all nascent branches or only those that terminate in diVCA release and subsequently form branches. The fraction of nascent branches that release diVCA is determined by kinetic competition between the two pathways of nascent branch disassembly: diVCA release leaving an Arp2/3-filament complex (with rate <i>k</i><sub>V\u2212</sub><sup>*</sup>; labeled green arrow in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and filament release leaving a diVCA-Arp2/3 complex (with rate <i>k</i><sub>A\u2212</sub>; thick red arrow in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

In each sample, activity and release rate values for the four diVCA constructs were randomly permuted, and the correlation coefficient was calculated. The probability p was then calculated as the definite integral of the normalized distribution of the sample correlation coefficients from the correlation coefficient of the experimental data to one.

The latter point is the major new contribution of the manuscript."

These nascent branch complexes usually associate non-productively and the complex typically dissociates as a unit. In a small subset of the cases, however, the diVCA component alone dissociates, and this almost invariably leads to branch formation. Furthermore, diVCA release and initiation of branch elongation occur at exactly the same time (within experimental error). The data in Figure 1 appear to be of high quality, and imply that release of diVCA is likely an obligatory step in the commitment to branch formation. 2) diVCA does not bind Arp2/3 complexes once branches have formed (Figure 2), again consistent with the idea that the presence of diVCA is incompatible with branch formation, and that diVCA departure induces a conformational change(s) that destroy the diVCA binding site and stimulates branch formation. 3) Mutations that alter the half life of diVCA within the nascent branch complexes also alter the rate of branching stimulation, and there is a strong positive correlation between the diVCA dissociation rate constant and the rate constant for branch formation (Figures 3 and 4). These observations support a model that explains how membrane-associated WASP complexes can stimulate actin branching, but then dissociate to create space for subsequent actin polymerization (Figure 5)."

The authors should therefore carry out statistical tests to determine whether there are significant differences in the measured parameters for wild type and mutant diVCA in Figure 4 (and elsewhere).

Sept confirmed this interpretation with Brownian dynamics simulations. Even though the trimer is unstable, it adds subunits like any longer filament. The nucleus in the case of Arp2/3 complex is therefore likely consists of the two Arps and one or two actin subunits. Therefore, the nucleus is formed when the first and second actin subunits bind Arp2/3 complex, which can surely happen prior to dissociation of V from the two actins.

Classic simulations of the time course of spontaneous actin polymerization (labs of Frieden, Pollard and Korn) showed that the nucleus is a trimer. Sept confirmed this interpretation with Brownian dynamics simulations. Even though the trimer is unstable, it adds subunits like any longer filament. The nucleus in the case Arp2/3 complex is therefore likely consists of the two Arps and one or two actin subunits. Therefore, the nucleus is formed when the first and second actin subunits bind Arp2/3 complex, which can surely happen prior to dissociation of V from the two actins. Thus what is observed in this experiment is not nucleation, but the beginning of elongation, which appears to be limited by dissociation of the diVCA as suggested by others. Therefore throughout the paper \u201cnucleation\u201d should be replaced with \u201celongation\u201d of the daughter filament (which is what is observed)</i>."

In 2001, Zalevsky et al. reported that VCA peptides have an activation step following assembly of VCA, actin and Arp2/3 complex onto the mother filament. The apparent activation rate constant for this step differed between N-WASP, WASP and WAVE1. The origin of this difference was concluded to be in the length of the acidic region, with a longer acidic region (e.g. in N-WASP) giving faster rate and a shorter region (e.g. in WAVE1) giving slower rate. We wondered if the \u2018activation step\u2019 might be departure of VCA. If so, shortening the N-WASP acidic region might make it more WAVE1-like, slowing dissociation. We proceeded to essentially reverse the series of experiments used by Zalevsky et al. by deleting several acidic residues from the N-WASP acidic region. Multiple VCA modifications along these lines generated VCA dimers with lower activity in pyrene actin assays than our wild type diVCA. The \u201cA*\u201d mutant had the smallest perturbation (in terms of amino acid changes) and was therefore chosen for further analysis in the single molecule measurements. In the interest of keeping the manuscript focused, we have not included a description of the reasoning involved in this aspect of the experimental design."

We agree with the reviewer that the multicomponent lifetime distributions are intriguing: they could potentially shed light on the different modes of interaction between VCA dimers and Arp2/3.
