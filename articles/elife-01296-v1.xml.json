In this study, we test this prediction by examining the properties and requirements of inter-Golgi transport within fused cells, which requires mobile carriers in order for exchange of constituents to occur. We report that both small soluble and membrane-bound secretory cargo and exogenous Golgi resident glycosyl-transferases are exchanged between separated Golgi. Large soluble aggregates, which traverse individual stacks, do not transfer between Golgi, implying that small cargoes (which can fit in a typical transport vesicle) are transported by a different mechanism. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that the carriers of both anterograde and retrograde cargoes are the size of COPI vesicles, contain coatomer, and functionally require ARF1 and coatomer for transport. The data suggest that COPI vesicles traffic both small secretory cargo and steady-state Golgi resident enzymes among stacked cisternae that are stationary."

One possibility is that the cargo protein matures within a single cisterna, which gradually moves from the cis to the trans face without the protein ever leaving it. Alternatively, the cisternae may remain fixed in position, while individual proteins are carried between them by specialized transport vesicles called COPI vesicles."

To do this, they labelled the proteins that reside within the Golgi of one cell green, and those within the Golgi of another cell, red. They then fused the two cells together, and traced the movement of labelled proteins between the two organelles."

In higher eukaryotes, the Golgi stack consists of four to six flattened cisternae, which contain a series of glycosyl-transferases and other resident membrane proteins. These are localized in the order of their function in distinct steady-state distributions along the axis between the cis (entry) and the trans (exit) face, as a result of a dynamic equilibrium resulting from a balance of anterograde (ER \u2192 cis \u2192 trans) and retrograde (trans \u2192 cis and Golgi \u2192 ER) flows. Proteins secreted from the cell, as well as constituents of the plasma membrane and a broad variety of membrane-enclosed compartments pass through the ER\u2013Golgi system in the anterograde direction, diverging only as they depart the Golgi stack at its trans face (also termed the TGN). During this anterograde passage they are typically glycosylated in a step-wise fashion as they encounter the responsible enzymes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Emr et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Klumperman, 2011</a>)."

We tested both a soluble cargo (hGH) and a transmembrane cargo (CD8<sub>lumenal</sub>), each of which also contained four repeats of a self-aggregation domain (FM) and a fluorescent protein tag.

In one approach, we measured the fluorescence recovery of photo-bleached Golgi within single or fused cells treated with H89, a kinase inhibitor that prevents ER export (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aridor and Balch, 2000</a>). In single cells, we anticipate the absence of recovery of photo-bleached Golgi in presence of H89. Within fused cells, we reasoned that H89 should abolish the fluorescence recovery of photo-bleached Golgi only if the ER is the main source of cargo. As described above, one population of cells expressing the GFP-tagged anterograde cargo and a second population containing a RFP-tagged resident protein were mixed and fused in the presence of AP21998 (to maintain the FM-linked cargo in a monomeric state) to allow inter-Golgi exchange of both markers. 30 min post-fusion, the fused cells were treated with H89 for 15 min before and during the FRAP of Golgi of fused cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, Golgi 2). The average recovery at 30 min after-photo-bleaching was 34 \u00b1 9.9% (n = 5). As a control, in the same population of cells that had not in fact fused (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, Golgi 1) no significant recovery was measured (7.2 \u00b1 6.5%, [n = 4]), validating that ER \u2192 Golgi is abolished under H89 treatment. It is known that H89 also inhibits PKD (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jamora et al., 1999</a>) and prevents exit from the TGN (<a href=\"#bib54\">Muniz et al., 1996</a>). This broad spectrum of action of H89, which blocks ER \u2192 Golgi as well as TGN \u2192 PM, also suggests that inter-Golgi transport occurs exclusively between cis/medial/trans cisternae of separated Golgi."

We fused YFP-Sar1<sub>H79G</sub> with cells expressing disaggregated-DsRed-CD8 (+VSVG) accumulated in the Golgi (using the 20\u00b0C temperature block).

This was performed by spinning-disk microscopy to track all the fluorescent objects within the entire volume of a dikaryon. First, 30 min post-fusion, we photo-bleached the entire volume of the fused cell (including the ER and the diffusing fluorescent dots [<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> panel 2]) except the two Golgi, which remained the only source of fluorescence. As described above, fluorescent dots that emanated from the Golgi rapidly appeared, increased in number and spread throughout the cytoplasm, resulting in an increase of the fluorescence intensity measured in the inter-Golgi space (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> panel 3, Graph). Then, after a 30 min recovery period, a second photo-bleaching was performed on the two Golgi (panel 4), the only source of fluorescence being now exclusively provided by the freshly formed cytoplasmic dots. We reasoned that if these fluorescent dots are truly the transport intermediates, then they should be able to repopulate the photo-bleached Golgi. After 30 min recovery, the gain of fluorescence observed at the Golgi (+56 \u00b1 14% of the total fluorescence initially emanating from the dots before the second photo-bleaching) was very similar to the loss (\u221263 \u00b1 14%) of the fluorescence intensity monitored in the inter-Golgi space (and emanating from the dots) (Graph, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The subtle difference (around 7%) between the loss (in the Golgi inter-space) of and the gain (at the Golgi) of fluorescence that suggests a loss of fluorescent material during the experiment, could be fairly attributed to moderate photo-bleaching that usually occurs during the time course of our imaging. Note that in these experiments, ST-RFP was coexpressed with GFP\u2013CD8<sub>lumenal,</sub> and allowed for rigorous identification of the Golgi area and to measure the GFP fluorescence recovery (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, red squares)."

Because of the lack of resolution, we do not know if in the presence of the ARF1-locked mutant, transport intermediates were actually produced but remained in the vicinity of the donor Golgi in a coated form, or if the ARF1 mutant prevented complete formation of COPI vesicles.

We determined their mean diameter (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) to be 114 \u00b1 11 nm n = 64, consistent with the outer diameter reported from electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib29\">Orci et al., 1986</a>). We then measured the size of the \u03b2-COP positive transport intermediates (dots) within fused cells by STED microscopy (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The mean size of the dots containing COPI was 126 \u00b1 15 nm, n = 181, and approximately the same size as the in vitro vesicles. Note that the vast majority (around 90%) of the dots containing either the anterograde cargo or the Golgi resident enzymes were negative for the COPI staining, consistent with the predictions of the vesicular model. Interestingly these uncoated structures showed a slightly reduced diameter 105 \u00b1 13 nm, n=60, which may reflect the absence of coatomer. Analysis of the shape (defined as the length of the major axis/length of the minor axis) of the transport intermediates and the in vitro carriers revealed similar radial symmetry (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, according to our 3D modeling, both the in vivo putative transport intermediates and the in vitro COPI vesicles were not as symmetrical as modeled vesicles (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This could be attributed to variation generated by the length and the spatial orientation of the antibodies (both primary and secondary) that bound heterogeneously to the coatomer. This subtle asymmetry fit with a recent high-resolution 3D study of in vitro COPI vesicles, which showed variable shapes of the vesicles, as well as a non-homogenous surface distribution of the coatomer (<a href=\"#bib9\">Faini et al., 2012</a>). Finally, our shape analysis and 3D modeling clearly establish that the COPI positive transport intermediates are not long tubules (30 nm \u00d7 300 nm), which show a significantly higher degree of asymmetry. However, it is impossible to rule out from such modeling that the carrier is a hypothetical, partially COPI coated small tubule. With a resolution of 80 nm, a 30 nm diameter tubule that is 150 nm long is indistinguishable from a 110 nm vesicle (as confirmed by simulations of STED images of vesicles and tubules; <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

This so-called 20\u00b0C block has never been reported to prevent intra-Golgi trafficking (neither anterograde or retrograde). Instead it has been shown that 20\u00b0C slows-down the trafficking, and results in retaining a large portion of the anterograde cargo within the trans-Golgi, with a significant amount remaining in the upstream cisternae that could serve as a back-up for inter-transport (<a href=\"#bib47\">Van Deurs et al., 1988</a>). However, to rule out that our results were reflecting non-specific sorting of the anterograde cargo at the TGN, we co-expressed the anterograde cargo with a dominant interfering mutant of the protein-Kinase D (PKD(DI)), known to block the TGN exit of anterograde cargo (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baron and Malhotra, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Cells expressing CD8-GFP and PKD(DI) were pre-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min in the presence of AP91988 and CHX, to allow for Golgi targeting of the cargo. As expected, we did not observe any leak to the PM. These cells were fused with other cells expressing DsRed-tagged resident enzyme and PKD(DI), and the inter-Golgi transport was recorded at 32\u00b0C for 1 hr. The anterograde cargo was efficiently transported to the acceptor Golgi (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, Golgi 1 and Graph) that originally contained only the resident enzyme. Note that 1 hr post-fusion, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence against GST-PKD(DI) to rigorously assess for the presence of the PKD mutant within the very same polykarion (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This result suggests that inter-Golgi transport is not due to a missorting of over-expressed cargo at the TGN."

It is possible that we artificially increased the probability of loading the highly concentrated cargo within the carriers. For instance, the excess of anterograde cargo localized in the trans-Golgi may now be transported to the cis-Golgi of the acceptor Golgi through a retrograde pathway. On the other hand, over-expression of the resident enzymes may alter their proper localization, resulting now in an anterograde transport of these resident proteins when they are in large excess. We cannot rule out that these phenomena happened to some extent in our assay. However, if these assumptions are correct, the two types of cargo should always be carried within the same transport intermediates when the cargoes are released from the same donor Golgi. Our results clearly establish that this in not the case (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Another interpretation would be to consider that the inter-Golgi transport intermediates would be COPI vesicles, which contain exclusively anterograde cargo in \u223c60% of the cases. \u223c20% would be COPI vesicles containing only Golgi resident enzymes that are retrograde-directed, needed in any model to maintain the steady-state distribution of resident Golgi enzymes in a dynamic equilibrium. It is tempting to suggest that the \u223c20% of COPI vesicles containing both anterograde cargo and resident enzymes would be anterograde-directed, contributing to the steady-state distribution of resident enzymes by forward flow. As is often the case, the truth may lie in between these two most extreme interpretations."

Our reasoning was that only mobile carriers, such as COPI vesicles, should be able to travel the long distance between well-separated Golgi of fused cells. Our results clearly establish that only small cargoes (anterograde or resident proteins) are exchanged, showing that inter-Golgi carriers are capable of size-filtration, and that small cargo transport must utilize a distributive mechanism different from the mechanism used by large soluble aggregates. More than half of the carriers exclusively contained anterograde cargo, suggesting sub-populations of COPI vesicles as previously documented by immuno-EM (<a href=\"#bib32\">Orci et al., 1997</a>)."

Certainly, the double photo-bleaching experiments show that the bulk of the cargo flux between Golgi is mediated by fluorescent \u2018dots\u2019 that function as carriers. However, we cannot strictly rule out that the genetic effects of ARF1 and \u03b5\u2212COP mutations on inter-Golgi transport are somehow an indirect coincidence or that the carrier is some kind of very short tubule that is partially coated and capable of fission (at one Golgi) and fusion (at another). Correlative electron microscope imaging of the fluorescent dots, including immunolabeling of coatomer, would theoretically be needed to address this distinction, which is probably semantic in any case since many COPI vesicles have uncoated portions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Faini et al., 2012</a>). Because the dots/COPI vesicles are highly dilute in cytoplasm, the rarity of finding such vesicles in single EM sections together with the inherent inefficiency of immunolabeling at the EM level, makes such an effort quixotic at best. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that exogenous glycosyltransferases exceed the capacity of the Golgi retention machinery and thus begin to behave like soluble cargoes, the relative abundance of COPI containing carriers harboring Golgi resident glycosyltransferase (\u223c40% of the total) suggests that these proteins are engaged in a dynamic equilibrium of anterograde and retrograde flow to maintain their differential steady-state cis-trans distributions. Their presence in transport vesicles is a required feature of the mobile cisterna model, as incorporated in the concept of cisternal \u2018maturation\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Glick and Malhotra, 1998</a>), but may also be important for establishing and maintaining their cis-trans distributions by bi-directional transport (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pelham and Rothman, 2000</a>) among static cisternae. We note that previous reports on the prevalence of glycosyl-transferases in COPI vesicles have yielded variable results (<a href=\"#bib31\">Orci et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Martinez-Menarguez et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cosson et al., 2002</a>)."

The data suggest that COPI vesicles traffic both secretory cargo and steady-state Golgi resident enzymes among stacked cisternae that are stationary over many hours in non-dividing cells. Further, they suggest that large soluble cargo are transported across the Golgi by a specialized mechanism that involves carriers which remain closely linked to the stack as the progress across it. While these inferences are as strong as current imaging technology permits, super-resolution methods are rapidly advancing and it will be important to further test these models as it becomes possible to visualize the content and movements of individual carriers in real time in living cells."

CD8-GFP was amplified from pC4-CD8-GFP as previously described (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lavieu et al., 2010</a>). ss-DsRed-FM4-hGH was created by adding DsRed into pC4S1-FM4-FCS-hGH (ARIAD) using XbaI/SpeI compatibility. ARF1<sub>Q71L</sub> was cleaved from ARF1<sub>Q71L</sub>\u2013GFP, a gift from G Romero (<a href=\"#bib48\">Vasudevan et al., 1998</a>) and inserted into a mDsRed vector (Clontech).

All structures were assumed to be surface-labeled, that is to carry signal only on a shell defined by the delimiters of the structures \u00b15 nm. The tubules were simulated in a set of different orientations to represent an isotropic distribution. Given that the size of the organelles is significantly smaller than the axial resolution of our STED microscope (maximum 300 nm vs \u223c700 nm), the rotated structures were projected into the focal plane before convolving them with a radially symmetric Lorentzian-shaped STED PSF with 80 nm full-width at half maximum which matches to the experimental performance of the used STED microscope. Poisson-distributed background and signal shot noise was applied and adjusted to experimentally observed signal-to-noise levels creating 150 structures of each shape. This data was analyzed with the same custom-written MATLAB routine used for the experimental data analysis."

This is obviously not the case (Figure 7). Often, cargoes were segregated into different carriers, supporting a \u201cselective bi-directional\u201d transport.

Now we show that the anterograde cargo does not co-localize with Rab5 and Rab7, which labeled early and late endosomes, respectively (Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1). This rules out that the inter-Golgi exchange is indirectly occurring via transport through the endosomal network. Together with our FRAP experiments that allow Golgi to be the only source of fluorescence, our results strongly suggest that we are monitoring a direct exchange between separated Golgi."
