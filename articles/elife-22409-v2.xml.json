The efficacy of statins in improving motor symptoms and prolonging survival of mutant mice suggested a potential role of statins in the therapy of Rett syndrome. In the present study, we show that <i>Mecp2</i> deletion had no effect on brain and reduced serum cholesterol levels and lovastatin (1.5 mg/kg, twice weekly as in the previous study) had no effects on motor deficits and survival when <i>Mecp2</i> deletion was expressed on a background strain (C57BL/6J; B6) differing from that used in the earlier study. These findings indicate that the effects of statins may be background specific and raise important issues to consider when contemplating clinical trials. The reduction of the brain cholesterol metabolite 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) found in B6.<i>Mecp2</i>-null mice suggests the occurrence of changes in brain cholesterol metabolism and the potential utility of using plasma levels of 24S-OHC as a biomarker of brain cholesterol homeostasis in RTT."

The efficacy of statins in improving motor symptoms and prolonging survival of mutant mice suggested a potential role of statins in the therapy of Rett syndrome. In the present study, we show that <i>Mecp2</i> deletion had no effect on brain and reduced serum cholesterol levels and lovastatin (1.5 mg/kg, twice weekly as in the previous study) had no effects on motor deficits and survival when <i>Mecp2</i> deletion was expressed on a background strain (C57BL/6J; B6) differing from that used in the earlier study. These findings indicate that the effects of statins may be background specific and raise important issues to consider when contemplating clinical trials. The reduction of the brain cholesterol metabolite 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) found in B6.<i>Mecp2</i>-null mice suggests the occurrence of changes in brain cholesterol metabolism and the potential utility of using plasma levels of 24S-OHC as a biomarker of brain cholesterol homeostasis in RTT."

Affected subjects, almost exclusively females, show progressive loss of acquired motor and cognitive skills and develop additional symptoms including stereotypic hand movements, drug-resistant seizures, breathing and autonomic dysfunctions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chahrour and Zoghbi, 2007</a>). Increased cholesterol plasma levels and changes in the activity/expression of genes and proteins involved in the cellular uptake, synthesis and feedback regulation of circulating cholesterol have recently been found in RTT individuals carrying <i>MECP2</i> mutations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grillo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Justice et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Segatto et al., 2014</a>), However, only one-third of RTT patients show elevated levels of plasma cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib17\">Justice et al., 2013</a>)."

Thus, altered cholesterol homeostasis may have a role in the pathogenesis of RTT and constitute a potential therapeutic target for a condition lacking specific treatments. The relationship between RTT and cholesterol is supported by recent findings showing that inactivation of <i>Sqle,</i> encoding squalene epoxidase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pfrieger and Ungerer, 2011</a>), and pharmacological treatment with the cholesterol lowering drugs statins improved motor deficit and enhanced survival in <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buchovecky et al., 2013</a>), a widely used experimental model of RTT (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ricceri et al., 2008</a>). <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice show complex changes in cholesterol levels, synthesis and metabolism in the brain and periphery, which depend on age, sex and line of mutant, among other factors (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buchovecky et al., 2013</a>). Transient increase of total brain cholesterol levels is observed in 56 day (PND56) old male 129.<i>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></i> mice, but not at PND70, while serum cholesterol increased at both ages in males 129.<i>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></i> but not in 129.<i>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/+</sup></i> heterozygous females or in another line of mutant mice, the B6.Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Jae</sup> raised on a different background strain (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buchovecky et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, <i>Cyp46a1</i>, encoding cholesterol-24-hydroxylase, the neuronal enzyme converting cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), increased at PND28 and markedly decreased in PND56 mutant mice (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buchovecky et al., 2013</a>). The reduced expression of <i>Cyp46a1</i> was replicated in PND56 B6.<i>Mecp2</i><sup>tm1.1Jae</sup> mice suggesting that this is a robust and background independent phenomenon that may lead to altered metabolism of cholesterol in RTT.

Thus, other factors may account for the discrepancies between the present and the previous study. The main difference is the background strain of the <i>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></i> mice, B6 in our study and 129 S6/SvEvTac (129) in Buchovecky et al. We observed a reduction of serum cholesterol in PND28 and PND56 <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice and no effect on brain cholesterol, regardless the age. The same allele deletion on the 129 background determined the opposite effect on serum and a transient increase of brain cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buchovecky et al., 2013</a>). It is known that genetic background is a source of variability that influences the expression of phenotype and drug response (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cervo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Crawley et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sittig et al., 2016</a>). In mouse models of RTT, genetic background influences the effects of <i>Mecp2</i> deletion on body weight, cognitive, anxiety and social phenotypes resulting, in several cases, in directionally opposite effects of the same allele (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guy et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Katz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Samaco et al., 2013</a>). <i>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></i> male mice on a 129 background are obese, likely because of a systemic metabolic disorder (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kyle et al., 2016</a>), while they are underweight in a B6 background (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guy et al., 2001</a>; present study). However, other phenotypes, such as motor deficits, are reproduced in different mouse models of RTT regardless of the genetic background (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lombardi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Samaco et al., 2013</a>). In agreement with our findings, brain cholesterol and the expression of <i>Cyp46a1</i> was not affected in <i>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></i> mice on the B6 background, aged 7 to 56 days and no changes of brain levels of the cholesterol precursor desmosterol were observed at 7 and 14 days (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lopez et al., 2017</a>). In addition, no increase in serum and brain cholesterol was detected in another line of <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice, the <i>Mecp2</i><sup>tm1.1Jae</sup> on a B6 background (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buchovecky et al., 2013</a>). These findings indicate that <i>Mecp2</i> deletion is not sufficient by itself to affect brain cholesterol homeostasis but may require the interaction with modifier genes, as already suggested for the influence of genetic background on the effect of <i>Mecp2</i> on body weight (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guy et al., 2001</a>)."

Interestingly, lovastatin had no effects on serum cholesterol in WT mice regardless of the background strain (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buchovecky et al., 2013</a>). These findings are consistent with the scarce effect of statins in reducing circulating cholesterol in mice (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pecoraro et al., 2014</a>) and indicate that neither the background strain nor the mutation of <i>Mecp2</i> alone are sufficient to explain the effects of lovastatin on serum cholesterol observed in 129.<i>Mecp2</i>-null mice.

However, the fact that fluvastatin is effective in improving motor deficits in 129.<i>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/+</sup></i> females, in which serum cholesterol levels are not changed, argues against this interpretation. In addition, it is unlikely that the concentration of lovastatin reaching the brain after the administration of 1.5 mg/kg is sufficient to suppress cholesterol synthesis. Even in mice given 3 mg/kg, brain levels of lovastatin were below 25 nM (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2007</a>), far less than the IC<sub>50</sub> and Ki for the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase estimated in vitro (77 and 150 nM, respectively) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bischoff et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bischoff and Heller, 1998</a>).

We administered two rotarod sessions to mice on PND49-50 and PND56-57 while in the previous study mice underwent a single session. We were able to show deficits in rotarod performance in our <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice comparable to those seen previously in the same line of mutant mice on a B6 background (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mellios et al., 2014</a>). Our mice learn the task as testified by the increased performance (latency to fall) from trial 1 to 8 while the performance of untreated 129.<i>Mecp2</i>-null mice used in Buchovecky\u2019s study was very poor and did not improve across trials. It is unlikely that our protocol prevented the effect of lovastatin in the rotaroad since <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice of the same mutant line, genetic background, age, sex, and similar basal performance in the rotarod improved in response to clenbuterol (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mellios et al., 2014</a>). In addition, using another motor test, the hanging-wire, we confirmed that lovastatin failed to rescue motor deficits of mutant mice. Thus, it is unlikely that our protocol masked potential effects of lovastatin on motor performance. However, we cannot exclude that previous learning of the task precluded the assessment of any effects lovastatin could have on motor learning in PND56-57 mice."

However, we found a moderate, but highly significant reduction of brain 24S-OHC in males and confirmed this effect in females <i>Mecp2</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the reduction of 24S-OHC may be attributable to reduced activity of cholesterol-24-hydroxylase or other mechanisms. Since 24S-OHC is produced to a large extent by brain neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bj\u00f6rkhem et al., 1998</a>), low levels suggests reduced metabolism of neuronal cholesterol. The fact that 24S-OHC was reduced in fully symptomatic mutant mice, but not in younger, pre-symptomatic mice suggests that reduced cholesterol metabolism is mainly associated to the symptomatic stage of the disease. Interestingly, 24S-OHC was recently found to control neuron excitability through allosteric modulation of the NMDA receptor (<a href=\"#bib29\">Paul et al., 2013</a>). Excitatory/inhibitory imbalance is found in the brain of <i>Mecp2</i> mutant mice. Selective impairment in excitatory synaptic transmission as well as elevation of neuronal activity occurs in different brain regions of <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calfa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nelson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Shepherd and Katz, 2011</a>). Altered composition of NMDA receptor subunits in cortical circuits contribute to the regression of visual cortical function in <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice (<a href=\"#bib13\">Durand et al., 2012</a>) and the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has been shown to reverse functional deficits of forebrain circuits\u2019 activity induced by <i>Mecp2</i> deletion (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kron et al., 2012</a>). These findings support the involvement of NMDA receptors in the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance found in the brain of <i>Mecp2</i> mutant mice and suggest that changes in brain levels of 24S-OHC, by modulating NMDA receptor activity may contribute to Mecp2-induced alterations of brain circuits\u2019 excitability."

The present findings suggest that the response to lovastatin is under the control of inherent genetic or other biological mechanisms specific to the effects of lovastatin on brain function. Thus, the efficacy of lovastatin in RTT may be limited to those patients that reproduce alteration of cholesterol homeostasis through mechanisms similar to those described in mice responding to statins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buchovecky et al., 2013</a>). Further studies are needed to establish the mechanisms involved in the reduction of brain levels of 24S-OHC, its role in RTT and the feasibility of using plasma levels of this metabolite as a biomarker of brain cholesterol metabolism, which may help to sort out patients that may best respond to treatment aimed at re-balancing cholesterol homeostasis."

All other data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. The body weight gain and latency to fall in the rotarod test were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA with genotype (<i>Mecp2</i>-null and WT) and treatment (lovastatin and vehicle) as between-subject factors and days or trials as within-subject factor. Further analysis with repeated measures ANOVA were conducted to assess the improvement of latency to fall across trials in mice given vehicle. Post-hoc comparisons between means were done by Tukey\u2019s test. The effects of lovastatin and vehicle in <i>Mecp2</i>-null and WT mice in the hanging wire test were compared by Kruskall-Wallis test, followed by Dunn\u2019s test corrected for multiple comparisons. Serum and brain levels of cholesterol, brain 24S-OHC and <i>Cyp46a1</i> expression in <i>Mecp2</i>-null and WT mice were compared by Student\u2019s t-test. Survival analysis and non-parametric tests was carried out on a PC with GraphPad Prism 6.07 (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA). All other statistics were performed by StatView 5.0.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., USA)."

The study builds on previous work showing alterations in cholesterol homeostasis in the brain of <i>Mecp2</i> null mice on a 129S6/SvEvTac genetic background and the ability of lovastatin to increase survival and motor performance in these mice. The current study presents data that the <i>Mecp2</i> null B6 mice do not have altered cholesterol levels in brain, only a slight decrease in serum cholesterol levels, and slightly lower levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in brain. The authors also show lovastatin does not rescue survival or motor performance deficits. The authors attribute the difference in cholesterol levels and the response to lovastatin between the studies to the genetic background strain of the mice. The study is well conducted and the findings are interesting as they show that lovastatin may have limited benefits in correcting behavioral phenotypes in mutant mouse models with implications towards the clinic. Given the importance of replicating findings that have clinical implications in the development of treatments for patients with Rett syndrome the study is significant."

                    "text": "This is a very well done study demonstrating that Lovastatin does not generally improve the phenotypes of mice lacking Mecp2. This is in contrast to a previous report that indicated that loss of function mutations in <i>Sqle</i> would modify in a positive fashion the phenotypes of <i>Mecp2</i> mutant mice, and that treatment of these same mice with Lovastatin improved the phenotypes. Critically, the authors of this manuscript used the identical mouse mutation and the same dosing method as was used in the previous manuscript, and they abide by recommendations for rigor in preclinical studies (randomization, blinding, etc.). The major difference between their work and the previous work is the different strain background, with the previous work using 129 and this using B6. This is a very important aspect, and a strength of this study. <i>Mecp2</i> mutant mice in a 129 strain are obese and develop a metabolic phenotype, whereas they are underweight in a B6 background. As the authors carefully describe, the potential benefit seen in the previous study was likely due to a strain specific effect, not a general effect of the <i>Mecp2</i> mutation.

Lipid measurements reveal reduced serum cholesterol levels in the knockout mice but no changes in bran cholesterol levels. Slightly lower levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol are observed in the brains of older male and female mutant mice but levels of the enzyme responsible for this metabolite, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase, are not different between control and knockout animals."

The study builds on previous work showing alterations in cholesterol homeostasis in the brain of Mecp2 null mice on a 129S6/SvEvTac genetic background and the ability of lovastatin to increase survival and motor performance in these mice. The current study presents data that the Mecp2 null B6 mice do not have altered cholesterol levels in brain, only a slight decrease in serum cholesterol levels, and slightly lower levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in brain. The authors also show lovastatin does not rescue survival or motor performance deficits. The authors attribute the difference in cholesterol levels and the response to lovastatin between the studies to the genetic background strain of the mice. The study is well conducted and the findings are interesting as they show that lovastatin may have limited benefits in correcting behavioral phenotypes in mutant mouse models with implications towards the clinic. Given the importance of replicating findings that have clinical implications in the development of treatments for patients with Rett syndrome the study is significant.</i> "

This is in contrast to a previous report that indicated that loss of function mutations in Sqle would modify in a positive fashion the phenotypes of Mecp2 mutant mice, and that treatment of these same mice with Lovastatin improved the phenotypes. Critically, the authors of this manuscript used the identical mouse mutation and the same dosing method as was used in the previous manuscript, and they abide by recommendations for rigor in preclinical studies (randomization, blinding, etc.). The major difference between their work and the previous work is the different strain background, with the previous work using 129 and this using B6. This is a very important aspect, and a strength of this study. Mecp2 mutant mice in a 129 strain are obese and develop a metabolic phenotype, whereas they are underweight in a B6 background. As the authors carefully describe, the potential benefit seen in the previous study was likely due to a strain specific effect, not a general effect of the Mecp2 mutation. This is very important with regards to the development of new therapies in Rett syndrome, because it raises concerns that statin treatments likely will not be of broad benefit in Rett syndrome. Replication studies such as this are very important to the field and unfortunately are not published enough.

This and the limited funding available suggested to us to focus our investigations on a few key points.

Available evidence suggest that lovastatin is absorbed and reach the brain of B6 mice better than less hydrophobic statins, such as pravastatin (Johnson-Anuna et al. 2005, JPET 312:786) and it effectively prevented audiogenic seizures in an experimental model of fragile X syndrome in B6 mice (Osterweil et al. 2013, Neuron 77:243)."
