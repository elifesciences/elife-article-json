In this study, we investigated the function of the Kinesin I heavy chain Kif5aa during retinotectal circuit formation in zebrafish. Targeted disruption of Kif5aa does not affect retinal ganglion cell differentiation, and retinal axons reach their topographically correct targets in the tectum, albeit with a delay. In vivo dynamic imaging showed that anterograde transport of mitochondria is impaired, as is synaptic transmission. Strikingly, disruption of presynaptic activity elicits upregulation of Neurotrophin-3 (Ntf3) in postsynaptic tectal cells. This in turn promotes exuberant branching of retinal axons by signaling through the TrkC receptor (Ntrk3). Thus, our study has uncovered an activity-dependent, retrograde signaling pathway that homeostatically controls axonal branching."

In this study, we investigated the function of the Kinesin I heavy chain Kif5aa during retinotectal circuit formation in zebrafish. Targeted disruption of Kif5aa does not affect retinal ganglion cell differentiation, and retinal axons reach their topographically correct targets in the tectum, albeit with a delay. In vivo dynamic imaging showed that anterograde transport of mitochondria is impaired, as is synaptic transmission. Strikingly, disruption of presynaptic activity elicits upregulation of Neurotrophin-3 (Ntf3) in postsynaptic tectal cells. This in turn promotes exuberant branching of retinal axons by signaling through the TrkC receptor (Ntrk3). Thus, our study has uncovered an activity-dependent, retrograde signaling pathway that homeostatically controls axonal branching."

Specialized proteins called molecular motors carry this cargo down the axon along \u2018tracks\u2019 composed of filaments called microtubules. Auer, Xiao et al. have now used genetic techniques to disrupt the gene that encodes an important molecular motor, called Kif5A, in developing zebrafish larvae. The effects of this manipulation on the development of the zebrafish's visual system were then examined."

The formation of synapses between cells in the retina and the tectum provides a pathway that enables information to travel from the eye to the brain. Auer, Xiao et al. found that in larvae that lack Kif5A, axons from the retina enter the brain about a day later than they do in normal larvae. However, when these mutant axons arrive, they produce large numbers of branches, each with the potential to form multiple synapses with cells in the tectum. However, none of the resulting synapses appear to respond to visual stimuli, which is consistent with the fact that Kif5A mutant larvae are blind."

This increased production of neurotrophin-3 was also observed when neuronal activity was blocked, for example by toxins. The lack of neuronal activity in retinal axons therefore seems to increase the production of neurotrophin-3, which in turn stimulates axonal branching. Future experiments could investigate the molecular signal that drives this increased production of neurotrophin-3, and how this is regulated during normal neuronal development."

This is especially apparent in highly polarized cells like neurons that are composed of complex dendrites and a long axon responsible for impulse propagation. Most of the proteins, mRNAs, and organelles required for cellular growth and function are produced in the cell body and must, therefore, be moved down the axon to the synaptic terminals. Microtubules serve as main longitudinal cytoskeletal tracks in axons, and it is well established that microtubule stabilization is a landmark of early axonal development that is sufficient to induce axon formation in vivo. Besides, microtubule stabilization alone can even lead to the transformation of mature dendrites into axons in differentiated neurons (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gomis-Ruth et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Witte and Bradke, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Witte et al., 2008</a>).

By TALEN-mediated gene disruption, we generated a <i>kif5aa</i> loss-of-function allele and could show that <i>kif5aa</i> mutant fish display a de-synchronisation of retinal axon and tectal growth. A delay in tectal innervation by mutant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons is followed by a period of exuberant branching, resulting in enlarged axonal arbors. GCaMP imaging revealed that <i>kif5aa</i> mutant RGCs do not transmit signals from the retina to their postsynaptic partner cells. Utilizing two additional zebrafish mutant lines with defects in RGC formation or function, <i>lakritz</i> (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kay et al., 2001</a>) and <i>blumenkohl</i> (<a href=\"#bib85\">Smear et al., 2007</a>), or specific silencing of RGCs by expression of botulinum toxin light chain B (BoTxLCB), we show that in all four cases the reduction of presynaptic activity leads to increased expression of neurotrophic factor 3 (Ntf3). The overabundance of this neurotrophin causes excessive branching by RGC axons. Thus, a defect in Kif5aa-mediated axonal transport has unmasked a homeostatic mechanism that adjusts axon arbor growth to levels of synaptic activity and depends on Ntf3 signaling."

Subsequently, we isolated two alleles with a 10 base pair (bp) and 13 bp deletion, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), both resulting in a frameshift in the ORF from amino acid (aa) 122 onwards. This frameshift leads to a premature stop codon at position 162 of 1033aa (<i>kif5aa</i><sup><i>*162</i></sup>) of the wild-type full-length protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In situ hybridization showed a strong expression of <i>kif5aa</i> in RGCs. In contrast, <i>kif5aa</i> mutant mRNA is dramatically down regulated in embryos starting from 24 hours post fertilization (hpf) onwards, probably by nonsense-mediated decay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). By quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), we could see a 47% decrease of <i>kif5aa</i> transcript levels in mutant embryos compared to controls. Both alleles were not complementing each other, and the mutant phenotype co-segregated with the TALEN-induced mutation over three consecutive generations.

The <i>BGUG</i> (<i>Brn3C</i> [also known as <i>pou4f3</i>]<i>:Gal4</i>; <i>UAS:mGFP</i>) transgene marks RGCs projecting to the SO (stratum opticum) and SFGS (stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale) layers of the optic tectum. Probably due to position-effect variegation of the transgene, a stochastic subset of one to ten RGCs per retina is labeled with membrane-bound GFP, which allows the imaging of RGC trajectories in the living or fixed fish brain. By in vivo imaging, we thus followed the growth behavior of single RGC axons over consecutive days. To guarantee comparability between RGC axons, we analyzed only RGC axons growing into the SFGC layer of the optic tectum at a central position on the rostral-caudal axis. While wild-type axons reach the tectal neuropil at 72 hpf and start forming a complex axonal arbor, axons of <i>kif5aa</i> mutant RGCs showed a delayed ingrowth into the target tissue (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

This phase of relative stability coincides with the consolidation of synaptic connections with tectal dendrites in the neuropil region (<a href=\"#bib64\">Nevin et al., 2010</a>). In <i>kif5aa</i> mutant axons, the observed delay of ingrowth into the tectum is followed by a period of highly active growth of the axonal arbor after 5 dpf, at a stage when wild-type axons are comparatively stable. We investigated the underlying branching dynamics by multi-day single axon imaging. Between 5 and 7 dpf, mutant axons added branches at about double the wild-type rate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Mutant axons also showed markedly increased numbers of active filopodia either being retracted or newly formed at any time point analyzed, as observed in 10 min timelapse movies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D</a>). Together, these findings suggest that, perhaps counterintuitively, absence of the motor protein Kif5aa stimulates growth of the axon arbor and maintains high filopodia activity."

To understand this better, we used genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors that were differentially expressed in two different neuronal types of the visual system, namely in RGCs and tectal periventricular neurons (PVNs) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Del Bene et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Nikolaou et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Hunter et al., 2013</a>). First, we probed the overall activity of the larva's visual system from 5 to 7 dpf in response to defined visual stimuli by using the <i>Tg(HuC:GCaMP5G)</i> transgenic line, in which among other neuron types, all RGCs and PVNs are labeled (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahrens et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, left). We did observe clear stimulus-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the wild-type PVN layer and the tectal neuropil (the later contains both PVNs dendritic and RGC axonal arbors) in response to a bar (<a href=\"#bib66\">Nikolaou et al., 2012</a>) moving in a caudal-to-rostral direction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) across the larva's visual field. This response was almost completely absent in <i>kif5aa</i> mutants at 5 dpf (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). In addition, also no response was detected in older larvae (7 dpf), arguing against a delayed onset of activity in mutants, as could have been speculated based on the observed developmental delay of RGC ingrowth (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Besides bars running caudal-to-rostrally, we also tested bar stimuli running in the opposite direction, bars moving in different orientations of 45\u00b0 steps across the visual field as well as looming stimuli. In neither of these, <i>kif5aa</i> mutants showed a response comparable to their wild-type siblings at any developmental stage between 5 dpf and 7 dpf (data not shown). We next investigated whether this loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the tectum was due to a presynaptic defect in RGC axons. For this, the same stimulation paradigms were employed in compound transgenic fish carrying <i>Tg(Isl2b:Gal4)</i> and <i>Tg(UAS:GCAMP3)</i>, which express the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor GCaMP3 in all or nearly all RGCs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ben Fredj et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Warp et al., 2012</a>). Mutant RGC axons in the tectal neuropil remained unresponsive to visual stimulation, whereas wild-type axons were robustly activated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These data provide an explanation for the behavioral blindness of <i>kif5aa</i> mutant larvae and indicate that the Kif5aa motor is required for proper synaptic transmission from RGC axon terminals to tectal dendrites."

Wild-type and <i>kif5aa</i> mutant larvae expressing genetically encoded calcium indicators (GCaMPs) in different subsets of neurons of the visual system were confocally imaged in the tectum contralaterally to the stimulated eye (dashed box inset). RGCs = Retinal Ganglion Cells, PVNs = periventricular neurons, NP = neuropil. (<b>B</b>) The activity of visual system neurons in response to visual stimuli is shown as normalized GCaMP fluorescence intensity changes (deltaF/F0) over time. GCaMP intensity was averaged over manually determined regions of interest (ROIs) that corresponded to well-distinguishable anatomical regions in the larval tectum, the neuropil (NP) and the periventricular cell bodies area (PVNs). In <i>Tg(HuC:GCaMP5)</i> fish (left), GCaMP5 is expressed pan-neuronaly, that is, in both neuropil and PVNs, whereas in <i>Tg(Isl2b:Gal4) \u00d7 Tg(UAS:GCaMP3)</i> fish (right), it is expressed in all RGCs and their processes. Scale bars = 20 \u03bcm. Asterisk = pigment cell in the skin. (<b>C</b>) Averaged deltaF/F0 ratio over time in response to a moving bar visual stimulation (black vertical line denotes the time point of the stimulus onset) in fish with pan-neuronal GCaMP5G expression. Four sequential rounds of stimulus presentation and the time-courses of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients in the neuropil ROIs (left panel) and periventricular cell bodies ROIs (right panel) of wild-type/heterozygous (red curve) and <i>kif5aa</i> mutant larvae (blue curve) (n = 7 each) are shown. Activity in the visual system of <i>kif5aa</i> mutants was almost absent between 5 and 7 dpf compared to wild-type larvae.

For this experiment, we made use of a Synaptophysin-GFP (Syp-GFP) fusion construct, a marker for stable presynaptic sites as well as for motile Synaptophysin-containing clusters (<a href=\"#bib55\">Meyer and Smith, 2006</a>). When co-expressed with a membrane-localized red fluorescent protein (RFPCaax) in single RGCs in wild-type or <i>kif5aa</i> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), we observed no difference in distribution of stable presynaptic clusters at 5 and 7 dpf by in vivo imaging (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This indicates that the formation of stable presynaptic clusters is not affected by the loss of Kif5aa. Quantification of Synaptophysin-containing vesicle movements in axonal segments (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>) did not show a difference in either anterograde or retrograde transport upon loss of <i>kif5aa</i> at 4, 5, and 7 dpf. This is consistent with previous studies showing that Synaptophysin containing vesicles are not transported by Kinesin I (<a href=\"#bib41\">Karle et al., 2012</a>) and furthermore argues against a general loss of vesicle movement in <i>kif5aa</i> mutant RGCs. To distinguish between different sized clusters, we divided vesicles into small (&lt;0.4 \u03bcm) and middle-sized to large clusters (&gt;0.4 \u03bcm) as defined previously for RGC axons in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib55\">Meyer and Smith, 2006</a>). Using these different categories, we detected a higher fraction of small, motile clusters in <i>kif5aa</i> mutant cells at 4 and 5 dpf, but not at 7 dpf, most probably reflecting their highly active growth behavior at that stage of development (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

This is consistent with previous reports showing that mitochondria are transported by Kif5a in other experimental systems (<a href=\"#bib51\">Macaskill et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Karle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Chen and Sheng, 2013</a>). We confirmed this result by quantification of the area covered by mitochondria per neuropil area in electron micrographs of transverse section of the tectal neuropil (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). At 6 dpf, mutants show a significant depletion of mitochondria from their branched axons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). To test if this mitochondria depletion from the distal axon of RGCs is caused by transport defects of this known cargo of Kif5a, we quantified the transport dynamics of mitochondria within RGC axonal segments (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). We did not detect a difference in overall amount of mobile vs stable mitochondria. In mutant cells, though, mitochondria were transported significantly more often in a retrograde direction than in an anterograde direction (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). This bias explains the depletion of mitochondria from the tips of <i>kif5aa</i> mutant RGCs. Mitochondria are preferentially localized at active synapses (<a href=\"#bib68\">Obashi and Okabe, 2013</a>) and are found in close proximity to stable Synaptophysin-containing clusters in RGC arbors (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). By co-labeling mitochondria and presynaptic clusters in the same cells in vivo we showed that approximately 40% stable presynaptic sites are associated with mitochondria in wild-type and <i>blu\u2212/\u2212</i> RGC axons (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We extended and confirmed these data observing mitochondria distribution and presynaptic densities in trigeminal ganglion cell axons (TGCs) (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). In contrast to wild-type cells, in TGCs in <i>kif5aa\u2212/\u2212</i> we observed a marked decrease of presynaptic densities located in close proximity of mitochondria. This observation is consistent with a recent study in zebrafish reporting a reduced number of mitochondria in peripheral cutaneous axon arbors in <i>kif5aa</i> mutant zebrafish embryos (<a href=\"#bib16\">Campbell et al., 2014</a>) without affecting the distribution of presynaptic densities."

Ntf3 protein was increased in the tecta of all three mutant lines in which presynaptic input to the tectum was abolished or highly reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). To directly test the causality link between the lack of presynaptic input and upregulation of Ntf3 in the optic tectum, we silenced the neuronal activity of RGCs by expressing a UAS:BoTxLCB-GFP construct in Islet2b:Gal4 zebrafish larvae. BoTx has been shown to specifically block synaptic vesicle release (<a href=\"#bib14\">Brunger et al., 2008</a>) and its injection has been used successfully in zebrafish embryos to silence neuronal activity (<a href=\"#bib65\">Nevin et al., 2008</a>). Similar to what previously observed in <i>kif5aa, lak</i>, and <i>blu</i> mutants, silencing of RGCs via BoTx expression leads to melanosomes expansion and failure to adapt to a light background (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Both, via qRT-PCR and Western blotting analysis we detected an upregulation of Ntf3 in these transgenic animals showing that, like in the previously described mutants, lack of RGCs presynaptic activity per se is sufficient to cause Ntf3 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>).

In addition, we observed that the distribution of mitochondria was not significantly altered in <i>blu\u2212/\u2212</i> RGC axons nor was the association with stable presynaptic sites (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 2B, 3</a>). Together these data suggest that Ntf3 upregulation does not per se affect mitochondria localization."

Donor RGCs were derived from a <i>Tg(Pou3f4:Gal4) \u00d7 Tg(UAS:RFP)</i> cross and visualized by the expression of a fluorescent membrane-targeted RFP. When cells were transplanted in low numbers from a transgenic donor into a host embryo, we could image single donor derived and fluorescently labeled RGCs, within a host environment. First, we could observe that the delayed ingrowth of <i>kif5aa</i> mutant RGC axons in the tectal neuropil is a cell-autonomous effect (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When growing in a wild-type environment, <i>kif5aa</i> mutant RGC axons invade the tectal neuropil 1 day later (4 dpf) than wild-type cells. Second, in contrast to what we observed in mutant larvae, arbor size was not increased at 5 or 7 dpf in mutant RGC axons that grow into a wild-type tectum (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). Mutant RGC arbors are significantly smaller, similar to those that overexpress <i>ntrk3adN-eGFP</i> (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Wild-type cells growing in a <i>kif5aa</i> mutant background show the opposite behavior. No stalling at 3 dpf was detected (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and, at 5 and 7 dpf, they established a significantly increased axonal arbor (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). To further demonstrate that the axonal arbor overgrowth observed both in <i>kif5aa\u2212/\u2212</i> and <i>blu\u2212/\u2212</i> was due to a common molecular mechanism, we transplanted single <i>kif5aa\u2212/\u2212</i> RFP labeled RGC into a <i>blu</i> mutant host.

At 3 to 4 dpf, RGC axons devoid of Kif5aa grew more slowly and reached their targets in the tectum with a delay of about 24 hr. Mutant retinotectal synapses did not transmit signals to tectal cells, but were apparently silent, resulting in a complete loss of visual responses. Both the stalled growth and the synaptic transmission defects were likely a direct consequence of the absence of Kif5aa. Some of the known cargoes of mammalian Kif5a are required for normal axon outgrowth (<a href=\"#bib41\">Karle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Chen and Sheng, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Schwarz, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Sheng, 2014</a>). In the zebrafish <i>kif5aa</i> mutant, mitochondria are significantly depleted from distal RGC axon terminals, as shown by in vivo imaging and transmission electron microscopy, suggesting that these organelles are Kif5a cargoes as in mammals. Furthermore, a recent report showed that Kif5aa has a similar role in the posterior lateral line nerve and peripheral cutaneous axonal arbors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Campbell et al., 2014</a>). Mitochondrial ATP production is required for synapse assembly (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lee and Peng, 2008</a>), the generation of action potentials (<a href=\"#bib7\">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</a>) and synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib95\">Verstreken et al., 2005</a>). In addition, synaptic mitochondria maintain and regulate neurotransmission by buffering Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib54\">Medler and Gleason, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">David and Barrett, 2003</a>). This deficit can therefore explain the impairment in transmitter release at the presynaptic terminals without, however, excluding the possibility that the impaired transport of other cargoes is also involved."

Early functions of kinesin I heavy chains are probably carried out by other members of this gene family in zebrafish, such as <i>kif5ab</i>, <i>kif5b</i> or <i>kif5c</i>. All isoforms homodimerize and may carry distinct sets of cargoes (<a href=\"#bib23\">DeBoer et al., 2008</a>). In mammalian neurons, KIF5C likely contributes to axon specification (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jacobson et al., 2006</a>). Similarly, the <i>Drosophila</i> KIF5 homolog kinesin heavy chain (KHC) drives axon initiation and transiently maintains axonal growth (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lu et al., 2013</a>).

In <i>lakritz</i> zebrafish larvae, RGCs are absent; the functional connection between the retina and the tectum thus is eliminated (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kay et al., 2001</a>). In <i>blumenkohl</i>, transmitter release is diminished (<a href=\"#bib85\">Smear et al., 2007</a>). Similar to our results with <i>kif5aa</i>, <i>blumenkohl</i> RGC axons show an increased arbor size and complexity (<a href=\"#bib85\">Smear et al., 2007</a>). The same retrograde signal may underlie the enlargement of retinal arbors following treatment with MK-801, a blocker of glutamate receptors of the NMDA-subtype (<a href=\"#bib79\">Schmidt et al., 2004</a>), or in <i>macho</i> mutants, in which RGCs fail to generate action potentials (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gnuegge et al., 2001</a>). In the case of <i>lakritz,</i> when single wild-type RGCs were transplanted into a <i>lakritz</i> host, their solitary axons formed larger and more complex arbors (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gosse et al., 2008</a>). This result is reminiscent of the phenotype of wild-type RGCs growing in a <i>kif5aa</i> mutant larva, that is, when they are surrounded by inactive axons. Interestingly, Ntf3 upregulation alone as observed in <i>blu</i> mutants or in overexpression experiments had no significant effect on mitochondria distribution and short-lived filopodia dynamic. This suggests that these phenotypes are specific to <i>kif5aa\u2212/\u2212</i> RGCs and probably caused by direct axonal trafficking defects, and that they are not due to impaired synaptic activity."

We generated a p5E-4nrUAS vector with four non repetitive UAS sequences by digestion of the 4Xnr UAS:GFP vector (<a href=\"#bib5\">Akitake et al., 2011</a>) and insertion of the 4nrUAS fragment into the p5E-10UAS vector (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kwan et al., 2007</a>) after HindIII and AleI digestion. To obtain constructs with multiple UAS sequences, we generated a p5E-4nrUAS-tagRFPCaax-pA-4nrUAS vector.

Microinjection of the pT2UAS:BoTxBLC-GFP plasmid (50 ng/\u03bcl) was based on standard protocols with Tol2 mRNA (25 ng/\u03bcl). Over 50 founders were screened for the presence of a functional transgene using a combination of behavioral assays (touch-evoked swimming, escape response) and the level of expression of the BoTxBLC-GFP fusion protein (Suster et al., in preparation)."

                                "text": "5- to 7-day-old nacre (mitfa\u2212/\u2212) or TL larvae were taken from a cross of <i>kif5aa</i><sup><i>*162</i></sup>+/\u2212 <i>Tg(HuC:GCaMP5G)</i> or <i>Tg(Isl2b:Gal4), Tg(UAS:GCaMP3)</i> transgenic fish. They were immobilized in 2% low melting point agarose and mounted with the dorsal side up on a plexiglas platform. The platform was then placed in a custom-made chamber and immersed in E3 solution without methylene blue. The agarose around the eyes was cut away with a scalpel to allow for an unhindered view for the larvae. The larvae faced with one eye towards a glass cover slip in the chamber wall at a distance between 8 and 10 mm. Directly behind this glass cover slip and outside the chamber, a monochromatic OLED array (800 \u00d7 600 px, 13 \u00d7 9 mm, eMagin) for visual stimulus presentation covering approximately 70\u00b0 by 50\u00b0 of the larva's visual field was positioned. A colored filter (Kodak Wratten No. 32) was placed between glass cover slip and OLED to block green light emitted from the OLED thus allowing for simultaneous imaging and visual stimulation. Visual stimuli were synchronized to the acquisition and consisted of single black bars on a white background (or the inverse) running along the caudal rostral axis. The long axis of the bar was orthogonal to the direction of motion. Each bar was approximately 7\u00b0 in width and moved at 16\u00b0/s. Visual stimuli were generated and controlled by custom scripts written in Matlab (MathWorks, for details see <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Source code 1</a>) using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brainard, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Pelli, 1997</a>). Confocal imaging of visually-evoked calcium responses in the tectum contralateral to the eye receiving the visual stimulus was performed using an upright microscope (Roper/Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a Spinning Disk head (CSU-X1, Yokogawa, Japan) and a 40\u00d7/1.0 NA water-immersion objective (Zeiss). Time-series streams of 5 min duration were acquired at 4 Hz with 0.323 \u00d7 0.323 \u03bcm spatial resolution (620 \u00d7 520 pixels). GCaMP3 or GCaMP5G were excited by a 491 nm laser and emitted light was bandpass-filtered (HQ 525/50). Images were taken with a CCD camera (CoolSnap HQ2 Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). We did not observe any differences in larvae from 5 dpf to 7 dpf. Therefore, the data sets were combined for analysis. Occasionally, a visual response at the onset of the laser illumination or the power-on of the OLED was observed that quickly returned to baseline, probably due to habituation of the fish. Therefore, we excluded the first few seconds from acquisition analysis. Each stimulus epoch was presented for 4.4 s to every animal with an inter-epoch interval of 5.6 or 10.6 s to allow for the GCaMP signal to return to baseline values. After the experiment, fish were genotyped. Confocal time-series were pre-processed by correcting for motion with a translation algorithm (Fiji [<a href=\"#bib78\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a>]). For each acquisition, ROIs for Neuropil and PVNs, respectively, were determined manually. Then the averaged ROI based time-series were smoothened by a low pass filter and the baseline signal was calculated by calculating the minimum in a time interval of 10 s before stimulus onset. The smoothened fluorescence signal and the baseline fluorescence were then used to calculate normalized signal intensity changes (% \u0394F/F0). To identify pixels that were response locked to the stimulus, we performed linear regression on the Calcium evoked time-series (<a href=\"#bib57\">Miri et al., 2011</a>). For this, we convolved the stimulus time-series with an exponentially decaying kernel with half-decay times for GCaMP5G (667 ms) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Akerboom et al., 2012</a>) or GCaMP3 (597 ms) (<a href=\"#bib89\">Tian et al., 2009</a>). This predicted fluorescence trace for the bar stimulus was then compared with the measured calcium traces for each pixel using Pearson correlation."

In our paper both Ntf3 and Ntrk3adN-GFP are overexpressed robustly using the Gal4/UAS system and different Gal4 lines specific for the tectum or the RGCs respectively.

However, to try to circumvent this crossover, we generated a construct that drives the expression of Ntrk3adN-GFP directly under the control of the RGC specific promoter <i>islet2b</i> and injected it in embryos overexpressing Ntf3 in the tectum (with the GAL4/UAS system). Unfortunately the Ntrk3adN-GFP expression was not high enough to achieve a dominant negative effect per se and the fluorescence was so weak that it was not detectable anymore at 5dpf. We then tried to address this point indirectly by overexpressing Ntrk3adN-GFP in single RGCs of <i>blu-/-</i> mutants, where Ntf3 is also upregulated in the tectum. This experiment showed that interference with Ntf3 signaling was able to rescue RGC growth, and even produced arbors that were less complex, with reduced number of branches as compared to wildtype RGCs.

In contrast, the vivo morpholino injection seemed to trigger a general toxic effect reducing axonal growth in an unspecific manner, as shown by the injection of control vivo morpholino.
