While many of the proteins governing these processes are known, their regulation is only beginning to be understood. Here we have applied quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify changes in phosphorylation status of presynaptic proteins in resting and stimulated nerve terminals isolated from the brains of Wistar rats. Using rigorous quantification, we identified 252 phosphosites that are either up- or downregulated upon triggering calcium-dependent exocytosis. Particularly pronounced were regulated changes of phosphosites within protein constituents of the presynaptic active zone, including bassoon, piccolo, and RIM1. Additionally, we have mapped kinases and phosphatases that are activated upon stimulation. Overall, our study provides a snapshot of phosphorylation changes associated with presynaptic activity and provides a foundation for further functional analysis of key phosphosites involved in presynaptic plasticity."

While many of the proteins governing these processes are known, their regulation is only beginning to be understood. Here we have applied quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify changes in phosphorylation status of presynaptic proteins in resting and stimulated nerve terminals isolated from the brains of Wistar rats. Using rigorous quantification, we identified 252 phosphosites that are either up- or downregulated upon triggering calcium-dependent exocytosis. Particularly pronounced were regulated changes of phosphosites within protein constituents of the presynaptic active zone, including bassoon, piccolo, and RIM1. Additionally, we have mapped kinases and phosphatases that are activated upon stimulation. Overall, our study provides a snapshot of phosphorylation changes associated with presynaptic activity and provides a foundation for further functional analysis of key phosphosites involved in presynaptic plasticity."

Kohansal-Nodehi et al. identified over 250 specific sites on proteins in the synaptosomes where phosphate groups are attached, including many on the key proteins known to operate in neurotransmitter release. Moreover, some proteins were modified at multiple sites, especially the proteins that form a scaffold to capture synaptic vesicles close to the membrane and prepare them for release. The data also revealed important clues about the enzymes that either attach or remove the phosphate groups."

Before fusion, synaptic vesicles attach to specialized sites at the presynaptic plasma membrane (active zones), which is associated with activation (priming) of the exocytotic apparatus. Furthermore, functionally distinct pools of synaptic vesicles coexist in each nerve terminal, with only a small proportion of them participating in recycling under normal physiological conditions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Denker et al., 2011</a>). Major progress has also been made in our understanding of the underlying molecular events. Synaptic vesicles contain proteins mediating neurotransmitter uptake (vesicular neurotransmitter transporters and a vacuolar ATPase) as well as proteins involved in vesicle docking (Rab proteins), calcium sensing (synaptotagmins) and fusion (SNAREs) (<a href=\"#bib95\">Takamori et al., 2006</a>). Active zones contain both scaffolding proteins such as piccolo, bassoon, liprins as well as proteins that mediate vesicle docking and priming (e.g. RIM and Munc13) (<a href=\"#bib92\">S\u00fcdhof, 2012</a>). Exocytotic fusion is executed by SNAREs, controlled by synaptotagmin, and regulated by additional proteins recruited from the cytoplasm such as Munc18 (<a href=\"#bib99\">Toonen and Verhage, 2007</a>) and complexins (<a href=\"#bib13\">Brose, 2008</a>). Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis (CME) is mediated by a whole array of adaptor proteins, many of which containing curvature-sensing BAR and F-BAR domains (<a href=\"#bib64\">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</a>) such as dynamin that is crucial for pinching off of coated pits. Actin dynamics plays a critical role in vesicle movement and endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cingolani and Goda, 2008</a>), and additional proteins are involved in other functions such as vesicle clustering synapsins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cesca et al., 2010</a>)."

Chemical synapses display profound plasticity and adaptation, and they are known to rapidly respond to a multitude of signals by changing their release properties. A large body of evidence shows that many presynaptic proteins are reversibly phosphorylated, suggesting that protein phosphorylation plays a key role in output regulation. In fact, synapsin1 was the first presynaptic protein to be discovered because it undergoes rapid phosphorylation upon depolarization of the presynaptic nerve terminal (<a href=\"#bib104\">Ueda et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Dolphin and Greengard, 1981</a>). Additionally, the key protein in membrane fission, dynamin, is rapidly dephosphorylated by a calcium-dependent phosphatase (calcineurin) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Liu et al., 1994</a>). Dephosphorylation alters the affinity of dynamin for some of its binding partners involved in endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib81\">Robinson et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anggono et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Clayton and Cousin, 2009</a>). In addition to dynamin, several other proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, termed 'dephosphins' are dephosphorylated upon depolarization, in calcium-dependent manner, including the scaffold proteins amphiphysin1 and amphiphysin2, the PtdIns(4,5)P phosphatase synaptojanin, the adapter proteins epsin, eps15, and AP180 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Cousin and Robinson, 2001</a>)."

Additionally, it was reported that phosphorylation of SNAP-25 at Thr138 interferes with assembly of SNARE complex and exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gao et al., 2016</a>). Moreover, phosphorylation of syntaxin1 at Ser14 and Ser188 regulates its interaction with Munc18-1 (<a href=\"#bib97\">Tian et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Rickman and Duncan, 2010</a>). Dephosphorylation of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) at Tyr 83 and Thr645 was reported to promote secretory vesicle fusion (<a href=\"#bib44\">Huynh et al., 2004</a>), probably by enhancing disassembly of SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Belluzzi et al., 2016</a>)."

For example, synapsin1 is phosphorylated at Ser9 by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI). It is also phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and CdK5 at both N and C termini (Ser62, Ser67, Ser549 and Ser551) and by CaMKII at its C terminus (Ser566 and 603) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cesca et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, the tyrosine-kinase Src phosphorylates synapsin1 at Tyr301 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Onofri et al., 2007</a>). Intriguingly, the functional consequences of synapsin phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at various phosphosites are different. While phosphorylation of Ser9, Ser566 and Ser603 upon stimulation decreases actin binding and increases exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, phosphorylation of Tyr301 has the opposite effect (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cesca et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, phosphorylation at Ser62, Ser67, Ser549 and Ser551 is downregulated upon stimulation of neurotransmitter release and decreases the binding of synapsin to actin filaments, leading to the suggestion that phosphorylation by Cdk5 at Ser549 and 551 defines the ratio between resting and recycling synaptic vesicle pools (<a href=\"#bib106\">Verstegen et al., 2014</a>)."

Commercially available kinase libraries combined with <i>in vitro</i>\u00a0synthesis of peptides permit extended screening of predicted phosphorylation sites although it needs to be borne in mind that this method is prone to both false negatives and false positives. Most importantly, advanced mass spectrometry (MS) methodologies have completely changed the field as they permit the identification of phosphorylation sites in a robust, global and quantitative manner (<a href=\"#bib43\">Huttlin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">de Graaf et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Sharma et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Giansanti et al., 2015</a>).

Synaptosomes respond not only to external signals but also to activators and inhibitors of various steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle such as clostridial neurotoxins (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blasi et al., 1994</a>), black widow spider venom (<a href=\"#bib68\">Nicholls et al., 1982</a>), or dynamin inhibitors such as dynasore (<a href=\"#bib28\">Daniel et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, synaptosomes were used to monitor stimulation-dependent changes in the phosphorylation of individual proteins such as synapsin and dynamin. Here we have used synaptosomes as a tool for the study of the presynaptic phosphoproteome. We observed many hitherto unknown changes in the phosphorylation pattern of, in particular, active zone proteins that exhibit concurrent changes in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at multiple locations/positions. Our results show that protein phosphorylation plays an even more important role than previously anticipated and appears to be critically involved in regulating active zone function."

Stimulation of all samples were stopped after 2\u2009min by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer and processed as described in Materials and methods. While rapid and reversible phosphorylation changes may not be detectable anymore at this time point, both exo- and endocytosis are at an activated steady-state level. Equal amounts of protein were digested by trypsin. For quantification, we used stable isotope dimethyl labeling (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boersema et al., 2009</a>).

In each set of comparisons, one of the incubation conditions was labeled as heavy and the other one as light. The differentially labeled peptides from two conditions were then mixed, and fractionated by strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography. This step was introduced since it reduced sample complexity and resulted in higher recovery rates of phosphopeptides (data not shown).

Note that due to redundancies and multiple overlaps in the functional categories, this type of analysis constitutes only a rough estimate.

This is in agreement with the previous report (<a href=\"#bib24\">Cousin and Robinson, 2001</a>). Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of CME proteins was proposed to serve two related functions. First, phosphorylation regulates the interactions between different CME proteins. For example, phosphorylation of the adaptor protein AP180 weakens its interaction with the AP-2 adaptor complex, which is required for synaptic vesicle endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hao et al., 1999</a>). In our dataset, three AP180 phosphosites (Ser600, Ser621 and Ser627) are dephosphorylated, one of which (Ser627) is located in the reported binding site. Second, phosphorylation generally weakens the affinity towards membranes containing acidic lipids and thus promotes dissociation of coat proteins. For instance, phosphorylation of dynamin1 by PKC at Ser795 prevents its association with phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib76\">Powell et al., 2000</a>)."

The amino acid positions of phosphosites identified on these proteins are shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, with the well characterized phosphoproteins synapsin1 and dynamin1 included for comparison. Similarly to synapsin and dynamin, we observed many sites of active zone proteins undergoing parallel changes in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent stimulation. Active zone proteins regulate synaptic transmission speed, precision, and plasticity (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kaeser, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Sudhof, 2012</a>). Our results show that, the proteins bassoon and piccolo are massively phosphorylated, with 48 and 31 sites being quantified in our experiments, respectively. Intriguingly, with the exception of 6 phosphosites, most of the piccolo phosphosites remained unchanged following stimulation. In comparison, bassoon exhibited a dramatic decrease in phosphorylation at multiple sites in addition to increased phosphorylation at 5 other positions. While the role of these novel sites is still unclear, it is conceivable that downregulation of the bassoon phosphosites may serve to regulate the global properties of the protein (e.g. surface charge density) rather than specific protein-protein interactions. In previous studies it has been reported that in spite of having similar structural motifs, bassoon and piccolo have different protein interaction partners (<a href=\"#bib96\">Takao-Rikitsu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Wang et al., 2009</a>).

The balance between the activation of calcineurin (PP2B) and Cdk5 is reported to control the dynamics of resting and recycling pools as well as activity of voltage gated calcium channels (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kim and Ryan, 2013</a>). Also the coordination of CdK5 activity and other proline directed kinases such GSK-3 and ERK1/2 can result in regulation of neurotransmitter release. For example, Cdk5 and GSK-3 phosphorylate P/Q- and N-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (<a href=\"#bib98\">Tomizawa et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Zhu et al., 2010</a>) whereas ERK1/2 phosphorylate L-type calcium channels (<a href=\"#bib90\">Subramanian and Morozov, 2011</a>) and phosphorylation decreases the activity of both types of calcium channels.

For each of these sites, 13-mer peptides were synthesized (containing 6 residues upstream and 6 residues downstream of the phosphoserine) and tested by a commercially available kinase assay against CaMKII, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C. As a control, corresponding peptides were synthesized, in which the phosphorylated serine was replaced by alanine. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, each of the peptides was recognized by at least one of the kinases. For instance, RIM1 Ser413 was phosphorylated only by PKA; consistent with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib60\">Lonart et al., 2003</a>). RIM1 Ser1141 was phosphorylated mostly by CaMKII and with lower efficiency by PKA. Bassoon Ser2844 was phosphorylated only by CaMKII. Piccolo Ser3626 was phosphorylated by CaMKII and PKA albeit with low efficiency. Liprin-\u03b13 Ser75 was the only phosphosite that was phosphorylated by all three kinases although PKC was less efficient. Together, these findings agree with the notion that activation of these three kinases during depolarization in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to\u00a0the phosphorylation of the active zone proteins at their corresponding phosphosites. Furthermore, it reveals another layer of regulatory diversification since each of the three kinases exhibited selective phosphorylation of the different substrates despite sharing a common core motif."

Although even the most highly enriched fraction of nerve terminals still contains significant contamination from many other parts of the starting tissue (as confirmed by the composition of the proteome of this fraction), synaptosomes represent the only compartment in the extract that forms membrane enclosed structures retaining basic cellular properties. These include the ability of generating and maintaining a membrane potential and of synthesizing ATP from externally added glucose or ketone bodies (<a href=\"#bib70\">Nicholls, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Choi et al., 2011</a>). Thus, physiological ATP-levels can only be maintained inside nerve terminals whereas residual external ATP is likely to be rapidly degraded by ATPases, in particular by uncoupled ion pumps. Consequently, protein kinases can only operate inside the nerve terminal during the experiment. Indeed, our comparison of the phosphoproteome versus the total proteome of the synaptosome fraction revealed a significant enrichment of proteins involved in presynaptic function while other proteins (including those of the postsynapse) were reduced or conspicuously absent (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

First, only a limited number of phosphosites is regulated by stimulation whereas the majority of the quantified sites did not change. Second, almost an identical pattern of regulated sites was observed regardless of whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free control was depolarized or not. This agrees well with the observation that depolarization in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> resulted only in very limited changes of the phosphosite pattern. This is remarkable when considering that clamp-depolarization by potassium is nonphysiological and may have deleterious side effects (e.g. drop in ATP levels). Consequently, our data show that the phosphorylation changes observed after stimulation are dominated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent kinases (such as CaMKII, PKC) and phosphatases (such as calcineurin), all of which are implicated in regulating presynaptic function (<a href=\"#bib84\">Scholz and Palfrey, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Brager et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Leenders and Sheng, 2005</a>)."

For instance, calcineurin upregulates adenylate cyclase in nerve terminals (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ferguson and Storm, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chan et al., 2005</a>), increasing cAMP levels and activating protein kinase A. Also, we observed increased phosphorylation of Ser567 in the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is known to enhance its activity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, our motif enrichment analysis suggests that CdK5, ERK1/2 and GSK-3 are downregulated upon stimulation. Another example is contributed by the increased phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit Neurabin-2 at S100 that decreases its activity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Colbran, 2004</a>). We conclude that the activity of kinases and phosphatases is precisely coordinated: upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, CaMKII, PKA, PKC as well as PP2A and PP2B are activated whereas proline directed kinases (e.g. CdK5 and GSK-3) as well as PP1 appear to be downregulated."

Active zone proteins are thought to structure the site for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion by forming dynamic scaffolds, and several of these proteins such as RIM and Munc13 have been shown to play a crucial role in vesicle docking and priming (<a href=\"#bib92\">S\u00fcdhof, 2012</a>). Only a few of these phosphorylation sites have been previously studied, such as phosphorylation dependent binding of 14-3-3 adaptor protein to bassoon at Ser2844 or the cAMP-regulated site in RIM1 (Ser413) that plays a role in long-term potentiation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Lonart et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kaeser et al., 2008</a>).

There are many examples showing that within such proteins individual phosphosites can have specific functions, e.g. in regulating the activity of enzymes such as CaMKII (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cohen, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Coultrap and Bayer, 2012</a>) or channels such as Kv2.1 (<a href=\"#bib75\">Park et al., 2006</a>). At present, we do not yet know whether there are individual sites on a given active zone protein that are solely responsible for a functional change (e.g. in regulating binding to a specific protein) or whether multiple phosphosites cooperate in changing the overall properties of a protein. Multi-site phosphorylation may modulate the binding affinity of a protein to other proteins or block binding by increasing its overall negative charge leading to repulsion from other proteins and charged membrane lipids (<a href=\"#bib76\">Powell et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arbuzova et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ferreon et al., 2009</a>). Also, our data only represent a snapshot of phosphorylation changes 2\u2009min after depolarization, i.e. when exo-\u00a0and endocytosis are both at elevated steady-state levels. Thus it is conceivable that transient changes occurring in the first seconds after stimulations were missed."

Thus it appears that the rapid feedback loops governed by kinases and phosphatases, which are activated during stimulation, do not target the exocytotic machinery itself but rather upstream processes such as docking, priming, and endocytosis. Further detailed studies will be required to unravel the functional consequences of these changes at the molecular level."

MaxQuant search was configured as follows; the mass tolerance was set to 20 and 4.5 ppm for first and main peptide search, respectively. The multiplicity was set to two (DimethLys0 and DimethNter0 was for \u2018light\u2019 and DimethLys4 and DimethNter4 for \u2018heavy\u2019 samples). Trypsin/P was fixed as protease and maximum of 2 missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification and methionine oxidation, acetylation (on N-terminal), phosphorylation on serine/threonine/tyrosine were specified as variable modifications. False discovery rate of 1% was applied and re-quantification was enabled. For proteomics analysis MaxQuant search was configured like phosphoproteomics search except that multiplicity was set to one with methionine oxidation and acetylation (on N-terminal) as variable modifications. The phospho (STY) output file from the MaxQuant was processed by \u2018Perseus version 1.5.0.9\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Cox and Mann, 2008</a>) for downstream data analysis.

In all assays 0.2 \u00b5g/\u00b5l of each peptide were used. First, standard curves were obtained by making a series of ADP-ATP (provided together with kinase assay kit) dilutions based on the kit protocol, and the luminescence of each dilution was measured. Then, we optimized the concentration of each kinase and of the ATP concentration to achieve 100% conversion of ATP to ADP based on the standard curves, defined as 100% activity. Then the phosphorylation of each investigated phosphosite by the respective kinase was calculated and reported as percent of activity of the enzyme. For PKA (Promega, Meinheim, Germany) assay, Kemptide (provided with the enzyme) was used as positive control peptide, and 5 \u00b5M ATP and 0.7 U/\u00b5l enzyme were used. For CaMKII (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) we first activated the enzyme by addition of 5 \u00b5M ATP, 1.2 \u00b5M calmodulin (provided with the enzyme) and 2\u2009mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 30\u2009min incubation at 37\u00b0C. Then, for the kinase reactions we used 5 \u00b5M ATP and 12 U/\u00b5l of kinase. Autocamide (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) was used as positive control peptide. For PKC (Promega, Meinheim, Germany) assays, Neurogranin (Provided with enzyme) was used as positive control peptide, and the incubation was carried out with 25 \u00b5M ATP and 5 ng/\u00b5l enzyme.

The presentation makes clear how proteomic studies can be analyzed to clarify and extend functional mechanistic studies carried out in more directed experiments. The study reveals two new interesting regulatory phenomena. The active zone proteins piccolo and bassoon are more extensively regulated by depolarization of synaptosomes in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> than predicted from earlier studies. The study also reveals that phosphosites that are up-regulated by depolarization plus Ca<sup>2+</sup> are dominated by sequence motifs that are recognized by CaMKII, PKA, and PKC, as might be predicted; however, phosphosites that are down-regulated are dominated by the SP motif recognized by ERK1/2, CdK5, or CdK5, suggesting that phosphatases activated by depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> act predominantly on sites regulated by the latter kinases, at least in the first few minutes after stimulation."

This, however, is inherent to the entire approach: synaptosomes (pinched-off nerve terminals) are not suitable for fine-tuning of synaptic excitation. On the other hand, synaptosomes have served since decades as a convenient and biochemically accessible model system for studying basic features of the exo- and endocytotic machinery. In fact, a lot of basic knowledge about the functioning of vesicle release was first obtained from studies on synaptosomes that were stimulated by KCl-depolarization (including phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of key proteins such as dynamin and synapsin). Many previous papers have shown that exocytotic release persists for several minutes after KCl depolarization (see e.g. [Nicholls and Sihra, 1986]), and that calcium influx ceases after an initial burst (McMahon and Nicholls, 1991), see also other papers by D.W. Nicholls and coworkers in the eighties and nineties of last century where this preparation was extensively characterized."

It is known that upregulation of these sites increases the activity of ERK1/2 kinases (this point is mentioned now in the second paragraph of the section \u201cCalcium-dependent kinases and phosphatases are mainly responsible for phosphorylation changes after stimulation\u201d). In the case of GSK3, the enzyme is probably inactivated during stimulation, for the following reasons: First, two phosphorylation sites (S278, Y279) known to result in activation of the kinase (Liang and Chuang, 2007) were downregulated upon stimulation. Second, it was shown previously that upon stimulation, an inhibitory site of the GSK-3 (S9) is phosphorylated by CaMKII and inactivates the kinase (Song et al., 2010). With respect to CdK5, our data show that phosphosites known to be phosphorylated by CdK5 are downregulated upon stimulation (e.g. dynamin1 S774, septin5 S17). On the other hand, PP2A is probably activated upon stimulation (phosphorylation of Ser567 in the regulatory subunit).
