In mammals, MBNL proteins negatively regulate an exon program specific of embryonic stem cells; however, little is known about the <i>in vivo</i> significance of this regulation. We studied AS in a powerful <i>in vivo</i> model for stem cell biology, the planarian <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>. We discover a conserved AS program comprising hundreds of alternative exons, microexons and introns that is differentially regulated in planarian stem cells, and comprehensively identify its regulators. We show that functional antagonism between CELF and MBNL factors directly controls stem cell-specific AS in planarians, placing the origin of this regulatory mechanism at the base of Bilaterians. Knockdown of CELF or MBNL factors lead to abnormal regenerative capacities by affecting self-renewal and differentiation sets of genes, respectively. These results highlight the importance of AS interactions in stem cell regulation across metazoans."

In mammals, MBNL proteins negatively regulate an exon program specific of embryonic stem cells; however, little is known about the <i>in vivo</i> significance of this regulation. We studied AS in a powerful <i>in vivo</i> model for stem cell biology, the planarian <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>. We discover a conserved AS program comprising hundreds of alternative exons, microexons and introns that is differentially regulated in planarian stem cells, and comprehensively identify its regulators. We show that functional antagonism between CELF and MBNL factors directly controls stem cell-specific AS in planarians, placing the origin of this regulatory mechanism at the base of Bilaterians. Knockdown of CELF or MBNL factors lead to abnormal regenerative capacities by affecting self-renewal and differentiation sets of genes, respectively. These results highlight the importance of AS interactions in stem cell regulation across metazoans."

In mammals, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from pre-implantation embryos can be cultured <i>in vitro</i> and differentiated into virtually any cell type (<a href=\"#bib43\">Martello and Smith, 2014</a>); however, a similarly potent cell type has not been found in adults. In contrast, in other animals, pluripotent stem cells are maintained during the entire life, and are often associated with extraordinary regenerative capabilities (<a href=\"#bib60\">Solana, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</a>). One of the most extreme examples are freshwater planarians, from which almost any body part can regenerate a complete organism in a few days. This ability relies on a large number of stem cells present in the adult, called neoblasts. Illustrating their pluripotency, single neoblasts transplanted into lethally irradiated hosts can rescue this lethality, restore tissue turnover, generate all cell types of the adult planarian and completely transform the genotype and phenotype of the host into that of the donor (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wagner et al., 2011</a>). However, recent analyses at single-cell resolution showed that the neoblast pool is highly heterogeneous, also including multiple lineage-committed precursors (<a href=\"#bib64\">van\u00a0Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>). Despite significant progress, how neoblasts are regulated and enable planarian cell turnover as well as regeneration upon wounding is still largely unknown."

However, this conservation does not include the major transcriptional regulators of mammalian stem cells. In ESCs, pluripotency is maintained by a core set of transcription factors that include OCT4, NANOG and SOX2, but these factors and their interactions are largely not conserved beyond the vertebrate lineage (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fernandez-Tresguerres et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gold et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Onal et al., 2012</a>). For instance, no homolog of NANOG has been described to date in any invertebrate species, despite extensive search (<a href=\"#bib56\">Scerbo et al., 2014</a>).

In particular, various reports have established the importance of alternative splicing (AS) for ESCs and somatic cell reprogramming (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ohta et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Venables et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Ye and Blelloch, 2014</a>). AS is the process by which introns and exons are selectively included or excluded from the pre-mRNA to produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms. AS can therefore expand transcriptomic complexity in a cell type- or developmental stage-specific manner, adding an extra layer of regulation to the control of gene expression. Moreover, highly regulated alternative exons often encode disordered regions of proteins that embed binding motifs, and thus have the potential to rewire protein-protein interactions in a context-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buljan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ellis et al., 2012</a>)."

These factors typically bind to pre-mRNAs in a sequence- and position-specific fashion, thereby modulating inclusion or exclusion of the target alternative sequence. For example, members of the MBNL family of RBPs are lowly expressed in mammalian ESCs, but show higher levels of expression in all profiled differentiated samples \u2013 ranging from transformed cell lines (e.g. HeLa, 293T, etc.) to highly histologically and functionally diverse adult tissue types (including multiple brain regions, muscle, liver, kidney, testis, etc.) \u2013 where they repress a program of alternative exons that are characteristic of ESCs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2013</a>). Knockdown of MBNL in differentiated cultured cells thus induces ESC-like AS patterns and this is sufficient to enhance somatic cell reprogramming (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2013</a>). MBNL targets are involved in diverse cellular processes, from cytoskeletal dynamics to gene regulation, and include disparate actors, from protein kinases to transcriptional regulators. For instance, MBNL-regulated AS of the transcription factor FOXP1 in mouse and human embryonic stem cells changes its DNA-binding properties, so that its stem cell specific isoform (FOXP1-ES) promotes transcription of pluripotency genes and represses differentiation genes, while its canonical isoform activates genes involved in differentiation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gabut et al., 2011</a>). Consistently, FOXP1-ES is repressed by MBNL upon differentiation by direct binding to intronic regions in the pre-mRNA (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2013</a>)."

Most of these events had intermediate inclusion levels in X2 samples (which comprise a mixture of stem cells and their early differentiation progeny, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), while inclusion levels in whole worm (WW) samples largely matched those of Xins samples. This latter correlation is expected since ~80% of the cells in adult planarians are differentiated (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bagu\u00f1\u00e0 and Romero, 1981</a>). In contrast to the global AS pattern (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), the majority of neoblast-differential AS events involved cassette exons (61.4%, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). RT-PCRs using primers (<a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) flanking alternative exon sequences confirmed all (22/22) tested neoblast-differential exons and showed a high correlation between RT-PCR and RNA-Seq inclusion level estimates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92, n = 88). Among these cassette exons, we detected 64 microexons that were differentially regulated between X1 and Xins fractions, the majority of which (82.8%) were more included in differentiated cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Consistent with this bias towards differentiated cells, vertebrate microexons have been recently shown to display enrichment in neural and muscle tissues compared to ESCs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Irimia et al., 2014</a>)."

Planarian genes with neoblast-differential exons were associated with a wide range of functions, and included cytoskeleton regulators (e.g. <i>add3</i>), membrane trafficking proteins (e.g. <i>tpd52</i>), metabolic enzymes (e.g. <i>pcca</i>), translation factors (e.g. <i>eif3h</i>) and protein kinases (e.g. <i>map4k3</i>), among others. Interestingly, neoblast-differential exons significantly more often overlapped disordered regions of proteins and avoided structured domains compared to general alternatively spliced and constitutive exons (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>; p \u2264 4.7 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22125</sup> for all comparisons, 3-way Fisher test and proportion tests, respectively). A similar pattern was described for tissue-specific exons in mammals (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buljan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ellis et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that neoblast-differential exons may also contribute to modulate protein-protein interactions in planarian cells."

Notably, 107 IR events were differentially enriched in X1 fractions compared to only 41 in Xins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). RT-PCRs confirmed all (11/11) tested X1-included introns compared to half (2/4) of X1-excluded (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.68, n\u00a0= 56, for all neoblast-differential introns tested). X1-included introns were usually longer than other intron types (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, P\u00a0= 7.1 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u221210</sup>, Wilcoxon Sum Rank test), and belonged to genes that were more highly expressed in differentiated cells than in neoblasts and their progeny (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a>). Importantly, in contrast to cassette exon events, which were predicted to generate different protein isoforms in neoblast and differentiated cells, nearly all X1-included IR events were predicted to disrupt the reading frame specifically in neoblasts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>;\u00a0p&lt;2.2 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u221216</sup>, chi-squared test). Moreover, these introns preferentially affected genes that were significantly enriched in functions related to cell differentiation, negative regulation of proliferation and cell type-specific metabolic pathways (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B\u2013C</a>). Therefore, altogether these data suggest that neoblast-specific IR may be operating to ensure that a subset of early-transcribed differentiation genes is not active in neoblasts. These genes might then be selectively activated upon differentiation by splicing out the 'detained' intron, similar to recent reports in mammalian ESCs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boutz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Braunschweig et al., 2014</a>)."

Strikingly, 20/21 (95.2%) of the probed cassette exons were also present and alternatively spliced in <i>D. japonica</i>, and 16/20 (80%) of these showed conserved differential regulation between X1 and Xins fractions in the two species (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>). Moreover, half of the IR events that could be probed despite the lack of a reference genome sequence in <i>D. japonica</i> also displayed conserved neoblast-differential regulation (3/6; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This level of neoblast-differential conservation is even higher than that observed between ESC-differential exons in mammals (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2013</a>), and strongly argues for the functional relevance of this AS program in planarians."

Most other investigated AS factors showed no differential enrichment in X1 fractions compared to the core spliceosome (e.g. <i>Smed-ptbp-1</i>, -2, <i>Smed-rbfox-1</i>), or were differentially enriched in Xins fractions (e.g. <i>Smed-mbnl-1, Smed-esrp-1,2</i>, etc.) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Tests of regeneration capability upon head ablation in these knockdowns showed diverse defects for several AS factor groups (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). As previously reported, <i>bruli</i>(<i>RNAi</i>) showed a dramatic phenotype with no regeneration. A similar phenotype was also observed for the <i>ptbp</i>(<i>RNAi</i>) group. Combined knockdown of the three other CELF factors, enriched in Xins fractions, induced elongation and movement defects, but did not seem to affect regeneration time dynamics.

Only <i>bruli</i>(<i>RNAi</i>) treatment induced dramatic changes in inclusion levels in X1 fractions compared to the control RNAi in the expected direction (i.e. towards the differentiated pattern; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), suggesting that <i>bruli</i> may act as a positive regulator of the neoblast AS program. Next, to assess the importance of the AS factors that were enriched in differentiated cells, we performed RNA-Seq of whole worms from these eight RNAi groups. Knockdown of the <i>mbnl</i> group [a four-gene knockdown: <i>Smed-mbnl-1;Smed-mbnl-like-1, -2, -3</i>(<i>RNAi</i>), hereafter <i>mbnl</i>(<i>RNAi</i>)] (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 3</a>) showed the most widespread changes in the X1-differential AS program towards the neoblast pattern (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), suggesting that MBNL proteins may act as negative regulators of the neoblast AS program. Remarkably, RNA sequence motif enrichment analyses using a library of RNAcompete-derived binding profiles for over 100 animal RBPs (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ray et al., 2013</a>) showed that MBNL consensus motifs are also the most significantly enriched in the downstream introns of X1-excluded cassette exons (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This result is consistent with planarian MBNL proteins enhancing X1-excluded exons via binding to their downstream introns, as described for mammalian MBNL proteins (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Based on these data, we decided to investigate the role of BRULI and MBNL factors as putative positive and negative regulators of the neoblast-differential AS program, respectively."

Purified GST-tagged RBPs were incubated with a 75-fold excess of an RNA pool and the binding preferences of the RBP elucidated by analysing bound RNAs by microarray analyses. The top scoring motifs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) for BRULI and MBNL-1 contained the 3-mer UGU and 6-mer GCUUGC, respectively, consistent with previous reports for their mammalian homologs. Moreover, the binding specificities of the planarian and mammalian homologs strongly correlated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) and highly significantly overlapped (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>; p&lt;5.5 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u221289</sup> for all pairwise homolog comparisons, hypergeometric test) across all measured 7-mers in RNAcompete assays. Thus, the planarian MBNL and CELF factors and its mammalian homologs have conserved binding specificities. Next, to investigate if planarian MBNL and CELF binding motifs were significantly associated with neoblast-differential alternative exons that show changes upon splicing factor knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), we analysed the presence of these motifs in the regulated exons and their flanking introns compared to sets of control exons (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Both BRULI and MBNL-1 motifs were highly significantly enriched in the downstream introns of exons downregulated upon the respective KD, whereas MBNL-1 motifs were also significantly enriched in exonic sequences of exons upregulated upon <i>mbnl</i> KD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). These locations are consistent with the enhancing or repressive functions, respectively, from RNA regulatory maps described for these factors in mammals (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>), and strongly suggest a direct regulatory role in AS regulation in planarians."

It was previously described that <i>bruli</i> knockdown induces a conspicuous neoblast loss phenotype (<a href=\"#bib25\">Guo et al., 2006</a>). Consistently, we observed a strong downregulation of neoblast markers after <i>bruli</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which were not affected by <i>mbnl</i> knockdown. Strikingly, the progeny markers <i>prog-1</i> and <i>prog-2-1</i>, which are expressed in postmitotic epidermal progenitors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">van\u00a0Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>), changed their expression levels in opposing directions upon <i>bruli/mbnl</i> knockdown. More precisely, <i>bruli</i> knockdown induced loss of these markers, whereas <i>mbnl</i> knockdown led to an increase in their expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar results were found with recently described markers for lineage-committed subclasses of neoblasts (<a href=\"#bib64\">van\u00a0Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and epidermal progenitors (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zhu et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which were confirmed by qPCR for <i>prog-1, prog-2-1</i> and <i>prog-1-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

The three Cluster 1 transcripts were strongly decreased after <i>bruli</i> knockdown, while the three Cluster six genes were decreased only after <i>mbnl</i> knockdown. These results are thus consistent with prominent neoblast loss after <i>bruli</i> RNAi, on the one hand, and progressive scarcity of differentiated cell types due to impaired neoblast differentiation after <i>mbnl</i> knockdown, on the other hand. These opposed effects of <i>bruli</i> and <i>mbnl</i> were also reflected in the gene functions altered upon knockdown, with stem cell function-related terms enriched in <i>bruli</i>(<i>RNAi</i>) decreased genes, compared to differentiated tissue function associated terms for <i>mbnl</i>(<i>RNAi</i>) (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the first PC sharply separated <i>bruli</i> samples together with <i>Smed-H2B</i>(<i>RNAi</i>)(which affects neoblast self-maintenance [<a href=\"#bib59\">Solana et al., 2012</a>]) from <i>mbnl</i> samples together with <i>Smedwi-2</i>(<i>RNAi</i>)(which impairs neoblast differentiation [<a href=\"#bib51\">Reddien et al., 2005</a>]) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>), further showing their opposing effects in stem cell properties. Taken together our results show that both CELF and MBNL factors are required for regeneration in planarians <i>in vivo</i>, and that they act by antagonizing each other in the control of neoblast self-renewal and differentiation."

We find widespread and strong differences in the pre-mRNA processing of genes expressed in both stem and differentiated cells. Most of these AS differences were evolutionarily conserved between two planarian species, strongly arguing for functional importance (<a href=\"#bib30\">Irimia et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore,\u00a0even several human genes undergo stem cell-specific AS in similar regions to those of their planarian orthologs. Moreover, we also found a large number of introns that are specifically retained in neoblast transcripts and that reduce the production of functional proteins in this cell type.

                        "text": "Our results further indicate that BRULI and MBNL proteins functionally interplay to regulate planarian regeneration. <i>bruli</i> is highly expressed in stem cells and contributes to shape neoblast-specific transcriptomes at least in part through regulation of exon skipping and intron retention. Depletion of <i>bruli</i> results in neoblast loss and thus in a complete lack of regeneration. On the other hand, <i>mbnl</i> factors are more expressed in differentiated cells, where they contribute to establish differentiated gene\u00a0expression. Therefore, loss of <i>mbnl</i> function is likely to affect neoblast differentiation, thereby reducing and/or slowing down regeneration. Our computational, biochemical and functional experiments indicate that CELF and MBNL proteins functionally antagonize by directly binding to their targets to control stem cell biology and regeneration in planarians (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Thus, these two families of RBPs not only play antagonistic roles in the regulation of multiple mammalian differentiation systems (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kalsotra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Ward et al., 2010</a>), but directly control stem cell-specific AS in an evolutionarily distant organism. Moreover, MBNL proteins have been shown to be major direct negative regulators of mammalian ESC-differential AS (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Venables et al., 2013</a>), similarly to what we describe here for planarian neoblast AS. While MBNL targets are largely not shared between planarians and humans (only seven orthologous gene groups have MBNL-regulated, non-homologous, exons in both species), the upstream role of MBNL proteins as repressors of stem cell-differential AS appears equivalent in both species. This suggests that direct negative regulation of stem cell transcriptomes by MBNL proteins, and perhaps positively by CELF factors, is a deeply conserved ancestral feature of animal stem cells. Indeed, a recent study has shown that sponges \u2013 the most basal metazoan lineage \u2013also differentially express a CELF homolog in their stem cells and an MBNL homolog in differentiated cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ali\u00e9 et al., 2015</a>). However, since the true homology status of planarian, poriferan and human stem cells is unclear, it also possible that CELF and MBNL proteins form an ancestral developmental regulatory module that has been deployed to regulate pluripotent vs. differentiated transcriptomes multiple times across evolution. For instance, in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> a Bruno homolog (<i>aret</i>) is only highly expressed in the early pluripotent embryo stages (from 0 to 4\u2009hr post fertilization) during development, while the embryonic expression of the single Mbnl ortholog (<i>mbl</i>) gradually increases from 6\u2009hr post fertilization (<a href=\"#bib23\">Graveley et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, we have shown that not only the antagonistic expression but also the binding specificities of BRULI and MBNL proteins are very similar to those of their human counterparts, an observation that is in line with the high level of conservation of binding specificities and positional regulatory codes described for several other RBPs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brooks et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Irimia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lareau and Brenner, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ray et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Loria et al., 2003</a>).\u00a0The dual regulation by CELF and MBNL suggests that other interactions between factors in the control of AS might exist."

Second, extra multiple-mapping transcript regions within the same scaffold were filtered out (in 281 gene models). Third, exons separated by annotated introns shorter than 30 nucleotides (usually 1\u20135 nucleotides) were collapsed into single exons (these often reflected UTR polymorphisms or discrepancies between the transcriptome and genome assemblies; 7665 merged exons). This resulted in a GTF containing 23,161 single-transcript gene models. We next used TransDecoder (version 1) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Haas et al., 2013</a>) with default parameters and compared against the Pfam A database to identify coding sequences (CDS). A total of 15,008 gene models had detected open reading frames (ORFs). For those cases in which TransDecoder detected more than one ORF in a given transcript (usually due to assembly errors that introduce PTCs), we generated multiple transcript identifiers (designated with suffixes following '_b', '_c', etc.). Custom perl scripts were then used to add start_codon and stop_codon lines to the GTF. Finally, to provide meaningful gene names, we performed tblastx (e-value 0.001, without low complexity filter) of the original planarian transcriptome against human mRNAs from Ensembl v71 and assign the gene symbols of best human hits (for 12,171 cases). This genome annotation was used as reference for our pipeline for alternative splicing (AS) identification, which includes multiple steps to identify non-annotated exons and splice sites (see below)."

First, a 'transcript-based' approach uses full transcript information from multiple sources to identify single or groups of multiple cassette exons (consecutive alternative internal exons flanked by constitutive exons). Given the limited availability of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and cDNAs for planarians, we used other published <i>de novo</i> transcriptome assemblies as ESTs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adamidi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Blythe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Labb\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Onal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Resch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rouhana et al., 2012</a>). In addition, we also used RNA-Seq-based transcript annotations, derived from our multiple samples (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>) individually using STAR (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dobin et al., 2013</a>) and cufflinks (<a href=\"#bib62\">Trapnell et al., 2010</a>). Novel junctions obtained in the 'splice site-based' module (see below) were also incorporated. Finally, 215 additional cassette exons identified from previous transcriptomic assemblies (<a href=\"#bib35\">Labb\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Onal et al., 2012</a>) were incorporated manually (indicated as 'CASSETTEd' in the Sme.EXSK.Template.*.txt files from <i>vast-tools</i>, see below). With this information, we identified individual or groups of neighbouring internal exons that are skipped in certain transcripts. Next, to quantify their inclusion levels, we mapped RNA-Seq reads to combinations of exon-exon junctions (EEJs) that define each splicing event. For the case of single exon skipping events, we generated EEJs for C1A, AC2 and C1C2 (A represents the alternative exon and C1 and C2 represent the neighboring constitutive exons), requiring a minimum of eight positions from each exon. For multi-exon events we generated all possible forward combinations from C1 to C2 exons. If multiple alternative 5\u2019 and/or 3\u2019 splice sites were associated with any alternative, C1 or C2 exons, they were also included in the combinations."

To identify splice sites <i>de novo</i>, for each annotated splice site donor/acceptor, we scanned two downstream/upstream introns for potential splice site acceptors/donors that would constitute a novel EEJ. Next, after subtracting the reads that map to the genome, we mapped our RNA-Seq data (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>) to this library of all potential EEJs, and considered 'novel splice sites' those supported by at least five reads mapped to multiple positions of the EEJ. Identification and quantification of cassette exons was done as described in (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2013</a>). Third, a 'microexon module' includes <i>de novo</i> searching of pairs of donor and acceptor splice sites in intronic sequence to detect novel, very short (i.e. 3\u201315 nt) microexons and subsequent quantification of inclusion levels using exon-microexon-exon junctions (EEEJ) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Irimia et al., 2014</a>). The outputs from the three AltEx modules were combined to produce a non-redundant list of cassette exons and associated quantifications. For exons that are identified by more than one module, the representative with the highest overall read coverage is kept. In case of equal coverage, priority is given to events derived from the 'transcript-based' module, followed by those from the 'microexon' module. For intron retention (IR), we used the approach described in (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braunschweig et al., 2014</a>). Finally, to detect and quantify Alt3 and Alt5 events, we used the output from mapping RNA-Seq reads to the EEJ library generated by the 'splice site-based module', which provides information on the usage of every hypothetical splice site donor and acceptor, as described in (<a href=\"#bib31\">Irimia et al., 2014</a>). In all modules, quantification of alternative sequence inclusion in the transcripts is derived only from junction reads (either EEJs or EIJs). Raw RNA-seq reads were processed and EEJ/EIJ read counts corrected for mappability obtained as previously described (<a href=\"#bib31\">Irimia et al., 2014</a>). These counts were used to derive alternative sequence inclusion levels using the \u2018Percent Splice In\u2019 metric (PSI; percent of transcripts from a given gene that include the alternative sequence)."

For those alternative sequences that are not present in our reference annotation, mapping was projected based on the information of the upstream exon. Then, sequences that contained in-frame stop codons (based on annotations and in-frame sequence translation from the upstream exon) or start codons (based on annotations) were flagged. Following a recent study (<a href=\"#bib31\">Irimia et al., 2014</a>), AS events were predicted to generate alternative protein (ORF-preserving) isoforms upon both inclusion and exclusion when they fall in the CDS, do not disrupt the reading frame (i.e. they have lengths multiple of three nucleotides), and do not contain in-frame stop codons predicted to trigger non-sense mediated decay (NMD; those stop codons that fall further than 50 nucleotides away from a downstream EEJ). Furthermore, if an alternative sequence is predicted to introduce an in-frame stop codon that would not trigger NMD but would generate a protein &gt;100 aminoacids shorter than the annotated isoform, it was also considered as an ORF-disrupting event. For multiexonic cassette events (arrays of more than one alternative exon), NMD/ORF-disruption was assessed for all exons as a group based on their inclusion patterns in neoblast and differentiated samples (e.g. if one frame-shifting exon is downregulated in neoblast samples and another upregulated, both the neoblast and differentiated isoforms can have intact reading frames). For ORF-disrupting AS events, two main categories were defined: ORF-disruption upon sequence inclusion or upon sequence exclusion. Therefore, depending on the neoblast inclusion pattern, we defined events that cause ORF disruption in neoblast samples, but not in other tissues ('ORF disruption in X1'), or the opposite, AS events that disrupt ORFs only in differentiated samples ('ORF disruption in Xins')."

The authors report on the conservation of an AS program comprising hundreds of alternative exons, microexons and intron retention events that is differentially regulated. Additionally, the authors identify a cohort of RNA binding proteins associated with the regulation of the uncovered AS program. Chiefly, the authors focus on two known functional antagonists involved in AS regulation, i.e., CELF and MBNL. Knockdown of either CELF or MBNL factors lead to abnormal regeneration by affecting the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation sets of genes. Additionally, the authors find neoblast-unique patterns of splicing that is opposingly regulated by the <i>bruli</i> and <i>mbnl</i> genes in neoblasts versus differentiated cells. Overall, the experiments are carefully executed and the data produced opens a significant number of novel lines of future investigations."

Nonetheless, opposing roles for CELF/MBNL factors in stem/progenitor/embryonic cells, or cells associated with multi/pluripotency in their last common ancestor is certainly possible and would be very interesting. Such a role could have been variously recruited to embryonic cells and different stem cell classes in the course of evolution. This could be assessed by studying many stem cell/embryonic cell classes in other organisms/animal tissues. It is also possible that opposing roles in AS programs for CELF/MBNL proteins is what is conserved and that this could be variously utilized in different types of biology. We recommend a more careful/nuanced wording throughout, but particularly in the discussion. This may help bring the evolutionary line of argumentation into sharper focus."

We have found no conservation of specific exon targets, but we identified several genes with MBNL-regulated exons in both lineages (most of these overlap with the ES/neoblast-regulated exons, described in <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). It should be noted, however, that while we see a very good level of conservation in the wild-type samples from two planarian species (<i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> and <i>Dugesia japonica)</i> conservation over such large evolutionary distances (i.e. planarians to mammals) is much harder to assess. Based on these results and following the Editor's suggestion, we have used more conservative phrasing when referring to the conservation of Mbnl regulation. Furthermore, we emphasize that the similarity is at the level of the regulatory axis (upstream factors) primarily and not the targets. This is for instance the case for miRNAs and their targets: while the upstream factors (miRNAs) are very well conserved there is extensive rewiring of the miRNA-target relationships. To reinforce this view, we have further elaborated the discussion by mentioning recent transcriptomic studies in animal stem cells and embryo development where CELF/MBNL antagonism could be at work in pluripotent cells, and more carefully worded the conservation case throughout. We believe that under the light of the recent findings of Alie and co-workers (PNAS 2015) \u2013 where they find expression of a CELF homolog in sponge (poriferan) stem cells (archeocytes) and an MBNL homolog expressed in all other differentiated cell types profiled \u2013 the case for conservation of CELF/MBNL antagonism in stem cells of all animals is stronger. However, this and other possibilities are now properly discussed in the text."
