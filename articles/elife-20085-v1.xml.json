It critically depends on the formation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, which develops into the macropinocytic cup. We show that macropinocytic cups in <i>Dictyostelium</i> are organised around coincident intense patches of PIP<sub>3</sub>, active Ras and active Rac. These signalling patches are invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery, as are all examined structures based on PIP<sub>3</sub> patches, including phagocytic cups and basal waves. Patch formation does not depend on the enclosing F-actin ring, and patches become enlarged when the RasGAP NF1 is mutated, showing that Ras plays an instructive role. New macropinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones. We propose that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP<sub>3</sub>, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery."

It critically depends on the formation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, which develops into the macropinocytic cup. We show that macropinocytic cups in <i>Dictyostelium</i> are organised around coincident intense patches of PIP<sub>3</sub>, active Ras and active Rac. These signalling patches are invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery, as are all examined structures based on PIP<sub>3</sub> patches, including phagocytic cups and basal waves. Patch formation does not depend on the enclosing F-actin ring, and patches become enlarged when the RasGAP NF1 is mutated, showing that Ras plays an instructive role. New macropinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones. We propose that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP<sub>3</sub>, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery."

For example, it allows human immune cells to sample their environment to search for harmful microbes and viruses and helps cancer cells to collect more nutrients so that they can grow more rapidly. During macropinocytosis, a protein called actin \u2013 which provides structural support to cells \u2013 drives the formation of cup-shaped structures from the membrane that surrounds the cell. Several signaling molecules control when and where the \u201ccups\u201d form, but it was not known exactly how the different types of molecules work together."

The experiments revealed that to make a cup, the actin first arranges to form a ring. The ring copies a template in the membrane, which consists of high concentrations of signaling molecules, and then extends outward to form a hollow cup by which fluid is taken up. The most important signaling molecule identified in these patches of membrane is a protein called Ras, which is mutated and hyperactive in many different types of cancer. In <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells that have a genetic mutation that makes Ras more active, the patches of signaling molecules and macropinocytic cups were larger than in normal cells."

Macropinosomes form from cup-shaped extensions of the plasma membrane, often known as circular ruffles, which are extended by actin polymerisation. The leading rims of these ruffles must be driven outwards to enclose liquid \u2013 often for a very significant fraction of the cell\u2019s diameter \u2013 but the base must be held static. The resulting cups can be several microns in diameter, and eventually close by constriction of their rim, with membrane fusion producing an endocytic vesicle. Here we address a critical and mysterious question about this process - how do cells organize actin to polymerize in a ring and so form the walls of the cup?"

However, macropinosomes take up fluid and so cannot use a particle as a template in this way. Nor is there any known equivalent in macropinocytosis of the coat that organises clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus it appears that macropinocytic cups must form by a self-organizing process within the actin polymerization machinery and its regulators."

Assembly of Arp2/3 based actin is controlled by the WASP family of nucleation promoting factors; the two family members that act at the plasma membrane are WASP and SCAR/WAVE (hereafter called SCAR). WASP is important for actin polymerisation during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib73\">Taylor et al., 2011</a>), and SCAR, acting in a five-membered complex (<a href=\"#bib26\">Eden et al., 2002</a>), for the formation of pseudopods (<a href=\"#bib64\">Seastone et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Veltman et al., 2012</a>).

These strains are thus an excellent starting point for research into the organising principles behind macropinocytic cup formation. Here we examine macropinocytosis with unprecedented 3D detail using lattice light sheet microscopy, and map the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators such as SCAR and WASP with respect to signalling molecules including PIP<sub>3</sub> and active Ras.

In axenic cells expressing an F-actin reporter, three types of large F-actin structure are routinely detected: macropinocytic cups, which predominate, pseudopods and basal waves."

We examined a reporter for active Rac in some of these movies and found that it is spatiotemporally associated tightly with F-actin in this morphological process (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

In more than 90% of cases the initiation is close to the base of the cell, even though most mature macropinocytic cups are present on the top, and are commonly described as 'crowns'. In the example illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), the parental ruffle first emerges close to the substratum (t\u00a0=\u00a00, white arrow) and cannot unequivocally be classified as either pseudopod or circular ruffle. The ruffle then quickly sweeps to the top of the cell, during which time it grows in size and splits several times, to produce multiple full-grown macropinocytic cups. As with splitting macropinocytic cups, the F-actin in de novo macropinosome cups is closely associated with signalling molecules, as illustrated by active Ras in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>) and discussed later. Circular ruffles can persist on the cell surface for prolonged periods before either closing successfully or regressing back into the cell body. Closure of the cup can be quite abrupt and often appears to involve the inward collapse of the rim (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Swanson et al., 1999</a>)."

Two independent RasG- mutants are substantially impaired in growth in liquid medium, as previously described, but contrary to the earlier report (<a href=\"#bib47\">Khosla et al., 2000</a>), both are also defective in fluid uptake. Compensation by other Ras proteins and genetic background differences may account for the discrepancy (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bloomfield et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bolourani et al., 2010</a>). RasC null cells have no growth defect and a lesser defect in fluid uptake, while RasS (not tested here) may also contribute to macropinocytosis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Chubb et al., 2000</a>). Notably, we confirm that the Arp2/3 activator, SCAR, is required for efficient fluid uptake (<a href=\"#bib64\">Seastone et al., 2001</a>)."

A GFP reporter tagged at the HSPC300 subunit accumulates at sites of actin polymerization (<a href=\"#bib78\">Veltman et al., 2012</a>). To confirm that this accumulation signifies the presence of activated SCAR complex, we correlated the signal with the expansion of pseudopods, using this as a proxy for actin polymerization. The results clearly show that the reporter is recruited during expansion phases but lost in stalls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). This correlation holds true globally: SCAR reporter intensity along the membrane correlates well with the local membrane expansion speed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) as all pixels with high SCAR reporter are associated with positive instantaneous membrane speed. Note that the small set of pixels with very high membrane speeds and no SCAR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, red arrow) are due to blebs (<a href=\"#bib83\">Zatulovskiy et al., 2014</a>)."

In all cases SCAR is consistently and significantly enriched at patch edges (p&lt;0.01), and never at their centres (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>). In the second test, the fluorescence intensity of the SCAR and PIP<sub>3</sub> reporters was extracted from the circumference of a number of growing cells and the results plotted as a 2D histogram (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In pixels with high PIP<sub>3</sub> signal, the SCAR signal is low, and conversely in pixels with high SCAR, PIP<sub>3</sub> is low. This method cannot show whether high SCAR and PIP<sub>3</sub> pixels are adjacent, but it does confirm that SCAR and PIP<sub>3</sub> do not co-localise but instead are anti-correlated."

The RasGAP NF1, encoded by the <i>Dictyostelium axeB</i> gene, is present in the wild-isolate NC4 but inactivated in its axenic derivatives, including the standard Ax2 used here. We found that macropinocytic cups in NC4 maintain exactly the same organization as in Ax2, with a central patch of PIP<sub>3</sub> surround by a ring of SCAR, but are much smaller and shorter-lived and often arise de novo (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I,J</a> and <a href=\"#media12\">Videos 12</a>, <a href=\"#media13\">13</a> and <a href=\"#media14\">14</a>). To confirm that macropinocytic cup size is controlled by NF1 we compared an isogenic NF1 knock-out with its parent (DdB; also derived from NC4; [<a href=\"#bib7\">Bloomfield et al., 2008</a>]). Cells from each strain were cultivated for 48 hr in axenic medium to maximally induce the rate of macropinocytosis. Under these conditions the <i>axeB</i>-null cells that have lost NF1 make significantly larger macropinocytic patches compared to cells from the parental strain (p&lt;0.01, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K\u2013L</a>)."

In this model, PIP<sub>3</sub> patches form as a consequence of circular ruffle formation, rather than as a cause of it. Despite the evidence that sharply curved membrane areas such as those present at the leading edge of lamellipods can act as a diffusion barrier (<a href=\"#bib79\">Weisswange et al., 2005</a>), this idea does not easily extend to <i>Dictyostelium</i>, where linear ruffles are much less common, and the central PIP<sub>3</sub> patch of macropinocytic cups can still form when ruffle formation is inhibited. However it remains possible that a diffusion barrier forms by a ruffle-independent mechanism, for example by septin-like molecules (<a href=\"#bib32\">Golebiewska et al., 2011</a>), or perhaps by cross-linking components within the patch. Further, <i>Dictyostelium</i> patches become larger when Ras signalling is increased by NF1 inactivation, showing that Ras plays an instructive part in their formation."

Previous work suggest that patches are self-organising structures, which can form independently of input from G-protein coupled receptors (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sasaki et al., 2007</a>) and are likely dependent on positive feedback loops between their components (<a href=\"#bib59\">Postma et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib60\">2004</a>). Our results argue against an essential role for feedback from PIP<sub>3</sub> to Ras, because activated Ras patches can form independently of type-1 PI3-kinases and are still able to recruit SCAR to their edges, albeit less efficiently than when PI3-kinases are present. Thus it appears that the kinetics that lead to patch formation must lie largely within the compass of the GEFs and GAPs activating and inactivating Ras."

                        "text": "We can only speculate on how SCAR is recruited to the periphery of Ras/PIP<sub>3</sub> patches. One possibility is that SCAR and Arp2/3 are preferentially recruited by newly synthesised F-actin (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ichetovkin et al., 2002</a>) produced by formins (<a href=\"#bib40\">Jasnin et al., 2016</a>), which might therefore be the initial actin nucleator to be recruited. However, this seems unlikely in the light of recent work showing that ForG contributes to the base of the macropinocytic cup, but seemingly not to the extending lip (<a href=\"#bib41\">Junemann et al., 2016</a>). Alternatively, SCAR might be moved to the periphery of Ras/PIP<sub>3</sub> patches, perhaps by myosin-1 motors. Early work showed that myosin-1 is genetically important for macropinocytosis in <i>Dictyostelium</i> (<a href=\"#bib54\">Novak et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Titus, 2000</a>). In support of the genetic evidence, myosin-1 isoforms are recruited to macropinocytic cups in both <i>Dictyostelium</i> and <i>Acanthamoeba</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Brzeska et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ostap et al., 2003</a>), most likely due to their affinity for PIP3 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). The PIP3-binding MyoE and MyoF are recruited in the centre and MyoB at the periphery of macropinocytic cups, forming a striking \u2018bull\u2019s eye\u2019 pattern (<a href=\"#bib14\">Brzeska et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Dieckmann et al., 2010</a>). In such a scenario, CARMIL may provide the link between myosin-1 and SCAR (<a href=\"#bib42\">Jung et al., 2001</a>)."

First, the basal actin waves, which give a valuable window into actin dynamics (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bretschneider et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gerisch, 2010</a>), appear to be formed as a consequence of the loss of NF1 in standard laboratory axenic strains. Knowing this should allow for better manipulation of these waves and for modelling to take account of their underlying need for activated Ras (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Khamviwath et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sasaki et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Taniguchi et al., 2013</a>). Second, we consider that all patches of PIP<sub>3</sub> and activated Ras are related by their common recruitment of SCAR to their periphery and are therefore likely to organise circular rings of actin polymerization, rather than the solid blocks characteristic of pseudopods. Therefore, the proposed role of these patches in chemotaxis, where they have been mistaken for pseudopods, needs to be re-evaluated."

This creates a coherent structured light sheet that can be dithered to create uniform excitation in a 400 nm thick plane across the entire field of view determined by the length of the light sheet. In order to obtain the array of lattice light sheet, a binary spatial light modulator (SXGA-3DM, Forth Dimension Displays) is placed conjugate to the sample plane, and a binarized version of the desired structured pattern at the sample is projected on the display. In the time-lapse dithered mode, 3D stacks were acquired either by moving the detection objective (Nikon, CFI Apo LWD 25XW, 1.1 NA, 2 mm WD), which is synchronized with the scanning galvo mirror, or moving the sample by fast piezoelectric flexure stage (Physik Instrumente, P-621.1CD) with 100\u00a0~150 z planes, to have about 20 \u00b5m in z axis with respect to the detection objective.

They then explore PIP<sub>3</sub> patches in a variety of other cellular processes, such as phagocytosis and basal actin waves, and demonstrate that similar SCAR rings are present. Finally, the authors investigate the role of Ras in the formation of PIP<sub>3</sub> patches."

How does the morphogenetic mechanism suggested by the authors actually work? It would have been useful to follow the dynamics of SCAR during macropinosome formation. Is the PIP<sub>3</sub> patch initially flat and then the membrane curves out? And if so, does this event correspond with SCAR ring formation? Or does the ring initially promote patch expansion, like in an actin wave, and if so, how does the transition to outwards polymerisation occur? Addressing any aspect of the mechanism of ring formation or of its morphogenetic effect would bring the paper beyond the level of an interesting observation."

This implies that PIP<sub>3</sub> patches precede the SCAR localization to patch edges, which is not demonstrated by the experiments. The figures provided, especially <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>, indicate that PIP<sub>3</sub> patches form coincident with SCAR concentration at leading edges. Instead, I would interpret the images as supporting a model in which SCAR defines a boundary, perhaps a diffusion barrier, that permits amplification of PI 3-kinase activity within a circular domain in the inner leaflet of plasma membrane; that is, SCAR either prescribes the PIP<sub>3</sub> patch or assembles coincidently into the concentric arrangement.

Veltman et al. beautifully describe macropinocytosis in the <i>Dictyostelium</i> amoebae. They show that macropinocytic cups do not arise from flat membrane protrusions or pseudopods as had been proposed but rather arise de novo from the membrane of a <i>Dictyostelium</i> cell. The Arp2/3 regulator SCAR is tightly localized to the rim of the extending cup, surrounding a membrane patch enriched for both active Ras and PIP<sub>3</sub>, where it is maintained all throughout its formation, expansion and closure. Cells with significantly reduced levels of PIP<sub>3</sub> continue to make macropinocytic cups, with a core patch of activated Ras bordered by SCAR, establishing that activation of small G proteins is the initial driver of cup formation. Support for this comes from the finding that true wild type strains extend significantly fewer and smaller macropinocytic cups, however upon disruption of the NF1 RasGAP (which is mutated in axenic laboratory strains) macropinocytosis is dramatically upregulated. Together with previous work in the field, the results establish that Ras/Rac activation is critical for macropinosome formation that promotes the localized production of PIP<sub>3</sub> on the membrane and selectively recruits and/or activates SCAR at the border that, in turn activates Arp2/3 mediated actin polymerization to drive cup extension."

PIP<sub>3</sub> appears to be dispensable for this initial step but must play a role in subsequent steps. The results also demonstrate that membrane patches of PIP<sub>3</sub> are not associated with pseudopods but are rather mainly involved in the formation of macropinocytic structures, an important clarification for the field that has focused a good deal of attention to the role of PIP<sub>3</sub> in directed migration. Naturally, these findings raise the critical question of how specific small GTPases with roles in macropinocytosis act together with PI3K to orchestrate subsequent events. Activated Ras/Rac is permissive for SCAR activation at the edges of the forming and mature cup but how the relatively large region of active Ras on the membrane causes such restrictive localization of SCAR remains an intriguing mystery."

A condensed report of these publications of known roles for Rac isoforms on macropinocytosis has been added to the Results section of the revised manuscript."

As such, speculation on the nature of the diffusion barrier that remains after latrunculin treatment may be pre-emptive.
