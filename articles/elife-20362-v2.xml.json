However, the impact of the interneuron-astrocyte signaling into neuronal network operation remains unknown. Using the simplest hippocampal Astrocyte-Neuron network, i.e., GABAergic interneuron, pyramidal neuron, single CA3-CA1 glutamatergic synapse, and astrocytes, we found that interneuron-astrocyte signaling dynamically affected excitatory neurotransmission in an activity- and time-dependent manner, and determined the sign (inhibition <i>vs</i> potentiation) of the GABA-mediated effects. While synaptic inhibition was mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, potentiation involved astrocyte GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, astrocytic glutamate release, and presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors. Using conditional astrocyte-specific GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (<i>Gabbr1</i>) knockout mice, we confirmed the glial source of the interneuron-induced potentiation, and demonstrated the involvement of astrocytes in hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations in vivo. Therefore, astrocytes decode interneuron activity and transform inhibitory into excitatory signals, contributing to the emergence of novel network properties resulting from the interneuron-astrocyte interplay."

However, the impact of the interneuron-astrocyte signaling into neuronal network operation remains unknown. Using the simplest hippocampal Astrocyte-Neuron network, i.e., GABAergic interneuron, pyramidal neuron, single CA3-CA1 glutamatergic synapse, and astrocytes, we found that interneuron-astrocyte signaling dynamically affected excitatory neurotransmission in an activity- and time-dependent manner, and determined the sign (inhibition <i>vs</i> potentiation) of the GABA-mediated effects. While synaptic inhibition was mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, potentiation involved astrocyte GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, astrocytic glutamate release, and presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors. Using conditional astrocyte-specific GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (<i>Gabbr1</i>) knockout mice, we confirmed the glial source of the interneuron-induced potentiation, and demonstrated the involvement of astrocytes in hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations in vivo. Therefore, astrocytes decode interneuron activity and transform inhibitory into excitatory signals, contributing to the emergence of novel network properties resulting from the interneuron-astrocyte interplay."

We found that the precise timing and strength of interneuron activity controls the\u00a0excitatory synaptic transmission, which is either inhibited by single action potentials (APs) or potentiated by high firing rates. While inhibition was mediated by presynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, the potentiation required the activation of astrocytic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations, glutamate release from astrocytes, and activation of presynaptic group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The dual effect of interneurons was mediated by activity- and time-dependent stimulation of different signals triggered by presynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> and astrocytic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, which resulted in the dynamic regulation of excitatory transmission. To assess the astrocytic function of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and their role in excitation boosting, we generated genetically modified mice with conditional ablation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in astrocytes (GB1-cKO). For that purpose we crossed GLAST-CreERT2 knockin mice (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mori et al., 2006</a>) with <i>Gabbr</i>1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib18\">Haller et al., 2004</a>). In these mice we observed the absence of excitatory synaptic potentiation by interneuron stimulation. Furthermore, complex circuit activities, such as theta and gamma oscillations, were regulated by GABAergic-astrocytic signaling in vivo, showing astrocyte-specific GB1-cKO mice a notable reduction of those rhythms. In summary, we show that, besides synaptic inhibition, interneuron activity may exert new additional forms of synaptic regulation, which involve the participation of astrocytes, and that the activity-dependent interplay between interneuron-astrocyte-excitatory synapses contributes to the emergence of new dynamic properties of neural network function."

We simultaneously recorded from interneurons and monitored Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at the soma of the astrocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

To test whether this interneuron-evoked astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was necessary for the synaptic potentiation, we pharmacologically prevented astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations while monitoring CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>). After assessing that bursts of interneuron APs transiently increased the success rate of the recorded synapses, perfusion with thapsigargin (which depletes the internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores; 1 \u00b5M) abolished both the interneuron-induced astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (41 astrocytes from five slices; p=0.37; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and the synaptic potentiation (<i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a09; p=0.46; paired <i>t</i> test; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). To unambiguously down-regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals selectively in astrocytes, we injected through the astrocytic recording pipette BAPTA (a Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator; 40 mM) into the gap junction-coupled astrocytic network (<a href=\"#bib13\">Di Castro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Navarrete and Araque, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Serrano et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>).

To discard indirect effects of BAPTA outside the astrocytic network on the IN-mediated modulation of synaptic transmission, a BAPTA-containing pipette was placed in <i>stratum radiatum</i> nearby to the stimulation electrode in absence of astrocyte recording. During 30 min of recording no changes in synaptic parameters were found (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that the observed effect was not caused by the leakage of BAPTA in extracellular space and buffering Ca<sup>2+</sup>, thus reducing transmitter release (cf.[<a href=\"#bib60\">Serrano et al., 2006</a>])."

                                "text": "Because the astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal can stimulate the release of different gliotransmitters that modulate neuronal activity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Perea and Araque, 2010</a>), we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the interneuron-induced astrocyte-mediated synaptic potentiation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Cholinergic signaling can increase synaptic transmission through activation of astrocytic muscarinic receptors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Araque et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Navarrete et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Perea and Araque, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Takata et al., 2011</a>). Antagonizing these receptors with atropine (50 \u00b5M) did not affect the interneuron-induced astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (n\u00a0=\u00a036 astrocytes from five slices, p=0.22; Wilcoxon rank-sum test), as well as the synaptic potentiation (n\u00a0=\u00a06, p=0.26; paired <i>t</i> test; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Endocannabinoid signaling might also enhance excitatory transmission directly by activation of astrocytic type one cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Navarrete and Araque, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2010</a>) or indirectly by depressing GABA release from synaptic terminals (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carlson et al., 2002</a>). The CB1R antagonist AM251 (2 \u00b5M) did not affect the interneuron-induced astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations (n\u00a0=\u00a032 astrocytes from five slices, p=0.13; Wilcoxon rank-sum test) or the synaptic potentiation (n\u00a0=\u00a05, p=0.17; paired <i>t</i> test) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). Therefore, neither cholinergic nor endocannabinoid signaling were involved in the synaptic potentiation. Glutamate released by astrocytes regulates neurotransmission through activation of glutamatergic receptors (<a href=\"#bib22\">Henneberger et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jourdain et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Perea and Araque, 2007</a>), such as group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Navarrete and Araque, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Navarrete et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Perea et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sasaki et al., 2012</a>). After assessing that bursts of interneuron APs increased the success rate of recorded synapses, perfusion with group I mGluR antagonists MPEP (50 \u00b5M) and LY-367385 (100 \u00b5M) blocked the synaptic potentiation (<i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a06; p=0.02; paired <i>t</i> test) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), without affecting the astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (39 astrocytes from five slices; p=0.76; Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Additionally, recent studies have reported the contribution of D-serine released by astrocytes to synaptic plasticity through NMDA receptor activation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Henneberger et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Takata et al., 2011</a>). However, the synaptic potentiation induced by interneuron activity was unaffected by the perfusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (50 \u00b5M; <i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a06; p=0.11; paired <i>t</i> test) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>); suggesting that EPSC modulation was independent of the astrocytic D-serine actions. Taken together, these results indicate that high interneuron activity enhance excitatory transmission through activation of astrocytic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, which stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes that activates group I mGluRs at excitatory terminals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

Interneuron activity plays key roles in the appearance of certain oscillatory network activities, such as theta (3\u201312 Hz) and gamma frequency bands (25\u2013100 Hz), which have relevant functions in coding neural information\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib33\">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</a>). Therefore, we stimulated the interneurons to elicit firing patterns that simulate those involved in these rhythms. Bursts of interneuron APs were elicited by depolarizing pulses (166 ms delivered at 3 Hz for 30 s) while continuously stimulating SC at 6 Hz. Thus, SC-evoked EPSCs were phase-locked at the interneuron depolarization (up-EPSC) and resting levels (down-EPSC) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <i>inset</i>). The analysis of the responses showed that interneuron stimulation bursts evoked: (1) an overall potentiation of the synaptic efficacy mediated by an enhancement of the success rate at both up-EPSCs and down-EPSCs (success rate: 132.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.32% and 150.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.22% of basal, respectively; <i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a013; p&lt;0.001 <i>vs.</i> basal; paired <i>t</i> test) that lasted throughout the stimulus period, and (2) fast dynamic changes of the synaptic efficacy and success rate within each up/down cycle (i.e., depolarized or resting state of the interneuron) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), that is, up-EPSC values were significantly lower than those of immediately succeeding down-EPSCs (mean relative success rate difference: 17.34%; p=0.04; paired <i>t</i> test) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). No significant changes in the synaptic potency (p=0.29; paired <i>t</i> test; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) were observed. Consistent with the mechanisms described above, the overall IN-evoked potentiation was unaffected by picrotoxin (down-EPSC, <i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a011; p&lt;0.001; paired <i>t</i> test), but blocked by CGP55485 (down-EPSC, <i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a011; p=0.97; paired <i>t</i> test) or MPEP+LY367385 (down-EPSC, <i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a08; p=0.53; paired <i>t</i> test) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), and absent in <i>Ip3r2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (down-EPSC, <i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a07; p=0.06; paired <i>t</i> test) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that it requires GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation, astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and mGluR activation."

In summary, bursts of interneuron activity induced a dynamic modulation of CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission consisting on an overall steady potentiation superimposed with faster transitions within each cycle of up and down interneuron states. While the latter and faster effect is due to GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated inhibition of transmitter release, the former and sustained modulation is mediated by astrocytic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, which stimulate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release of glutamate that activate presynaptic mGluRs at the excitatory terminals."

We examined the basic properties of local field potentials (LFP) in the dorsal hippocampus in resting conditions (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and after whisker stimulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Analysis of the LFP responses and power spectrum revealed that sensory stimulation boosted the theta and gamma components in control littermates, and significant changes occurred in those oscillatory neuronal responses in mice with down-regulated expression of astrocytic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Both theta band (peak 4\u20138 Hz; p=0.007; unpaired <i>t</i> test) and low gamma band activities (peak 30\u201350 Hz; p=0.042; Wilcoxon rank-sum test) were partially reduced in GB1-cKO mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), indicating a significant role of astrocytic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in these network oscillations, which are related to cognitive and behavioral tasks\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib8\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Moser, 2013</a>). Theta\u2013gamma coupling is thought to have an important function regulating hippocampal\u2013cortical and subcortical communication during learning, episodic memory and recall tasks (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hanslmayr et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tort et al., 2009</a>). We therefore analyzed the cross-frequency coupling between theta phase and gamma amplitude in resting and after whisker stimulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). We found that the magnitude of phase-amplitude coupling, measured as phase-locking value (PLV), was enhanced in control littermates after sensory stimulation (PVL= from 0.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 to 0.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07; n\u00a0=\u00a024 epochs; p=0.017; paired <i>t</i> test; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) as reported previously in behaving rodents (<a href=\"#bib12\">Csicsvari et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tort et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, the coupling between theta and gamma oscillations was disrupted in GB1-cKO mice, which did not show changes in PVL index after whisker stimulation (PVL= from 0.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 to 0.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04; n\u00a0=\u00a036 epochs; p=0.62; paired <i>t</i> test; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), indicating that ablation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in astrocytes weaken either hippocampal theta and gamma rhythms as well as their coupling. Additionally, the impact of astrocyte-GABAergic signaling was revealed under stimulus driven-hippocampal activity conditions (i.e., whisker stimulation), but no differences were observed in resting conditions (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting a state-dependent astrocyte neuromodulation of hippocampal rhythms in vivo. In summary, astrocytic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are involved in an\u00a0oscillatory brain activity in vivo, contributing to theta and low gamma waves in stimulus-driven conditions."

Our results show that GABAergic signaling dynamically impacts excitatory transmission in an activity- and time-dependent manner that is controlled by astrocytes. While excitatory neurotransmission was inhibited by interneuron single APs through activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (characterized by fast kinetics) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Farrant and Nusser, 2005</a>), it was enhanced by bursts of interneuron APs through additional and concurrent slower mechanisms (i.e., astrocyte GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation, G-protein-mediated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, astrocytic glutamate release, and presynaptic group I mGluR activation) that persisted after the interneuron burst (i.e., during the interneuron down-state). Therefore, different patterns of interneuron activity determine diverse consequences on excitatory synaptic transmission by direct interneuron-principal cell mechanisms (fast inhibition) and by novel interneuron-astrocyte signaling mechanisms (slow potentiation). In the latter mechanisms, astrocytes decode interneuron activity and transform inhibitory GABAergic signals into excitatory glutamatergic signals that enhance synaptic transmission. In addition, we found a subset of synapses that express both phenomena, switching from inhibition to slow potentiation according to the inhibitory GABAergic tone. Thus, the existence of new mechanisms to fine-tune the output of local synapses by astrocyte activity might contribute to control the excitation-inhibition balance at the hippocampal circuits."

Here, we show that the activation of interneruons evoked synaptic inhibition independent of GABA<sub>B</sub> signaling, because it was present after their blockage with CGP55845 but was abolished by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist picrotoxin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>).

Our results indicate that the glutamate released from astrocytes stimulated by interneurons can also access mGluRs in excitatory synapses to transiently enhance their synaptic efficacy, suggesting that a single gliotransmitter may have multiple effects depending on the site of action. In addition to glutamate, hippocampal astrocytes may also release ATP, which is converted to adenosine that depress synaptic transmission through activation of A1 adenosine receptors\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pascual et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Serrano et al., 2006</a>). This mechanism has been proposed to be triggered by high frequency stimulation of SC that sequentially activates interneurons and astrocytes leading to the heterosynaptic depression in the hippocampal CA1 region (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Serrano et al., 2006</a>). Then, astrocytes immersed in the same circuit may be stimulated by interneurons to release different gliotransmitters (i.e., glutamate or ATP) that influence synaptic transmission in different forms. The specific circumstances leading to the release of particular gliotransmitters are unknown. While we directly stimulated interneurons to elicit specifically identified firing patterns, the activity evoked in interneurons during high frequency stimulation of SC was unknown. Since our results indicate that astrocytes decode interneuron activity, it is possible that the different regulatory effects were due to differences in the astrocyte signaling evoked by interneurons. This represents an additional example of the importance of the context-specificity of signaling in the reciprocal communication between neurons and astrocytes (for a detailed discussion, see [<a href=\"#bib4\">Araque et al., 2014</a>]). Because the molecular signaling governing interneuron-astrocyte mediated effects shown here were studied in juvenile animals, and considering the developmental receptor expression profiles (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sun et al., 2013</a>), whether these molecular pathways and complex features of interneuron-astrocyte signaling are conserved in the adult brain need further attention. In addition, present data cannot discard that residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> events might occur in the fine process of the GB1-cKO astrocytes, as they have been found for <i>Ip3r2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib62\">Srinivasan et al., 2015</a>); however, the existence of those events would not be sufficient to induce the synaptic potentiation observed after interneuron stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>, and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>). Thus, these data suggest that although the astrocyte-synaptic interactions might primarily take place at the astrocyte processes, the synaptic plasticity induced by interneuron-astrocyte communication is a highly regulated phenomenon that requires the active contribution of astrocyte somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling."

As a result, interneurons provide \u2018phasic\u2019 inhibition to the neuronal network, which is involved in the emergence of fast brain rhythms (<a href=\"#bib12\">Csicsvari et al., 2003</a>) and synaptic plasticity during critical periods of circuit formation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hensch, 2005</a>) that jointly contribute to the maturation of cognitive functions. Here, we imposed to interneurons an oscillatory activity of 3 Hz with intra-faster oscillations of 35\u201350 Hz (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). That rhythm, which is similar to physiological slow delta/theta (2\u20138 Hz) and low frequency gamma (25\u201340 Hz) bands found in the hippocampus, evoked fast episodes of inhibition nested within a long lasting enhancement of excitatory transmission. To unambiguously determine the locus and contribution of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors to the synaptic transmission and network coding properties, and considering that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are ubiquitous, we took advantage of a conditional astrocyte-specific GABA<sub>B</sub> knockout mouse. The\u00a0data shown here indicate that GB1-cKO mice showed a down-regulated GABA<sub>B</sub>-astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and the absence of the interneuron-mediated potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission. In vivo recordings in anesthetized mice remarkably displayed changes in the hippocampal oscillatory activity pattern. We found that theta and gamma oscillations that are associated with cognitive processes, as well as\u00a0the coupling between these rhythms were compromised in mice lacking GABA<sub>B</sub>-astrocyte signaling, indicating a critical role of astrocyte signaling in higher-order information coding. Thus, recent studies have shown how astrocyte activity can impact the state of neuronal circuits by regulating the generation of neuronal UP states (<a href=\"#bib54\">Poskanzer and Yuste, 2011</a>), and it has been related to brain rhythms (<a href=\"#bib55\">Poskanzer and Yuste, 2016</a>), such as slow cortical oscillations (&lt;1 Hz) associated with nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fellin et al., 2009</a>). Disruption of astrocytic vesicular release has been found crucial for gamma oscillatory hippocampal activity with significant impact in recognition memory tasks (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, giving the important role of interneuron activity and hippocampal oscillations in coding neural information, such as the control of the theta phase-modulation of gamma power that correlates with memory performance (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Moser, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</a>), the signaling between interneurons and astrocytes, which provides novel properties to the interneuron effects on excitatory synapses within the network, adds more complexity to neuronal information processing."

Here, present data from astrocyte <i>Gabbr1</i> knockout mice show a partial but significant decrease of stimulus-induced theta-gamma oscillations and coupling, and highlight the intricate roles of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in regulating the neural network operation considering their specific cellular targets. Together, these data suggest that astrocytes might be directly related to critical brain rhythms and their cognitive functions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). Considering that the promoter used GLAST can be expressed by progenitor cells in adult brain (<a href=\"#bib61\">Slezak et al., 2007</a>), we cannot rule out a partial contribution of derived cells from those progenitors to the in vivo observed responses. Some evidence have shown that acute brain slices might undergo hypoxic conditions causing reactive changes in astrocytes (<a href=\"#bib66\">Takano et al., 2014</a>), and a downregulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor expression (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zonouzi et al., 2015</a>); however, since the study of molecular individualities of the interneuron-astrocyte signaling show limitations that need to be explored ex vivo, these associated alterations and their potential influence cannot not be excluded from the observed responses."

Electrodes were placed stereotaxically according to the atlas\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib46\">Paxinos and Franklin, 2012</a>). Local field potentials (LFP) were recorded through stainless steel macroelectrodes (1 M\u2126) placed in the CA1 layer (AP, \u22122; L, 1.4; V, 1.1 mm from Bregma) and amplified (Differential AC Amplifier Model 1700, A-M System), bandpass filtered between 0.1 Hz and 500 kHz, and digitized at 100 kHz (PowerLab 4/25\u00a0T and LabChart, ADInstruments) running in a PC for direct visualization and storage. Then, two nichrome stimulating electrodes (Isolated Pulse Stimulator Model 2100, A-M Systems) were placed in the vibrissae. After stabilization and basal activity recordings, an electrical stimulus (10 Hz, 10 s duration at 10 V) was applied to vibrissae. Three stimuli were applied with an interstimulus period of\u00a0\u22655 min."

Also, the first 10 s, divided in 5 sec-bins, starting at the end of each stimulus were selected. Epoch was stored in a new file and converted to an adequate format to perform the spectral analyses (Clampfit 10.2, MDS Analytical Technologies). Spectral analyses for each bin were assessed by fast Fourier transformation through the\u00a0Hamming window with 50% overlap, obtaining the power density (V<sup>2</sup>\u2022Hz<sup>\u22121</sup>) with a spectral resolution of 0.38 Hz, from 0.38 to 100.3 Hz. Since animals had different levels of baseline power density, the power values for each frequency were normalized as a percentage of the total power density recorded before computing group results. After normalization six epochs were averaged for basal and post-stimuli condition and compared between control littermate and GB1-cKO mice. We selected the following frequency bands: theta, 4\u20138 Hz; low gamma, 30\u201350 Hz and high gamma, 70\u201390 Hz."

The process was performed by a custom-made script on MATLAB (<a href=\"https://github.com/abdel84/\">https://github.com/abdel84/</a>). Raw signal was decimated to a sample rate of 1 kHz, then an elliptical filter was applied to remove frequencies below 3 Hz and two additional bandpass filters for both Theta (4\u20138 Hz) and Gamma (30\u201380 Hz) bands. The Theta phase and the Gamma amplitude, respectively, were extracted and computed to obtain their time series using the standard Hilbert transform as described previously (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tort et al., 2010</a>) and to obtain the Phase-Locking Value (PLV). This index represents the degree to which the Gamma amplitude is comodulated with the Theta phase and ranges between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating stronger PAC interactions\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib69\">Tort et al., 2010</a>). To calculate the mean vector of PLV, circular statistics analysis was performed by using CircStat toolbox<sup>19</sup> and then normalized by Fisher\u2019s Z Transformation, to apply regular statistical analysis: z'\u00a0=\u00a00.5 [ln (1+r) \u2212 ln (1\u2212\u00a0r)]."

Single action potentials induced in GABAergic cells reduced synaptic efficacy and success rate of synaptic transmission whereas bursts of action potentials in GABAergic cells induced the opposite, a potentiation of synaptic efficacy and success rate of transmission. The first depressing effect was due to presynaptic GABAA receptor activation at Schaffer collateral synapses whereas the potentiation was mediated by GABAB receptors expressed at astrocytes. Activation of GABABRs increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and thereby induced glutamate release, which in turn presynaptically enhances glutamate release by acting at presynaptic metabotropic group I glutamatergic receptors. This is an elegant study providing intriguing and provocative data that identify astrocytic glutamate release as an interesting component of the GABAergic modulation of neuronal excitatory activity."
