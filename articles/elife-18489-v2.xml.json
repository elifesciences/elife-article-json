We assembled a panel of CRC organoids carrying either wild-type or mutant RAS, as well as normal organoids and tumor organoids with a CRISPR-introduced oncogenic <i>KRAS</i> mutation. Using this panel, we evaluated RAS pathway inhibitors and drug combinations that are currently in clinical trial for RAS mutant cancers. Presence of mutant RAS correlated strongly with resistance to these targeted therapies. This was observed in tumorigenic as well as in normal organoids. Moreover, dual inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway in RAS mutant organoids induced a transient cell-cycle arrest rather than cell death. In vivo drug response of xenotransplanted RAS mutant organoids confirmed this growth arrest upon pan-HER/MEK combination therapy. Altogether, our studies demonstrate the potential of patient-derived CRC organoid libraries in evaluating inhibitors and drug combinations in a preclinical setting."

We assembled a panel of CRC organoids carrying either wild-type or mutant RAS, as well as normal organoids and tumor organoids with a CRISPR-introduced oncogenic <i>KRAS</i> mutation. Using this panel, we evaluated RAS pathway inhibitors and drug combinations that are currently in clinical trial for RAS mutant cancers. Presence of mutant RAS correlated strongly with resistance to these targeted therapies. This was observed in tumorigenic as well as in normal organoids. Moreover, dual inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway in RAS mutant organoids induced a transient cell-cycle arrest rather than cell death. In vivo drug response of xenotransplanted RAS mutant organoids confirmed this growth arrest upon pan-HER/MEK combination therapy. Altogether, our studies demonstrate the potential of patient-derived CRC organoid libraries in evaluating inhibitors and drug combinations in a preclinical setting."

Furthermore, when organoids with the <i>KRAS</i> mutation were treated with some combination therapies that are currently being tested in clinical trials, the tumors stopped growing but the tumor cells failed to die.

RAS mutations occur in about 15% of all human tumors (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bos, 1989</a>) and so far all attempts to selectively interfere in mutant RAS signaling have failed in the clinic (<a href=\"#bib30\">Stephen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cox et al., 2014</a>). Progress has long been impeded by the fact that the currently used model systems to pre-test drugs are insufficient: cell lines, on the one hand, have very limited genetic diversity, while mouse models on the other hand, may not represent human tumors (<a href=\"#bib24\">Sachs and Clevers, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gould et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, until recently, personalized medicine required large-scale in-vitro screening on short-term cultures of tumor sections (<a href=\"#bib6\">Centenera et al., 2013</a>), or alternatively, resource-intensive in-vivo screens using xenotransplantation of tumors into immunodeficient mice (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Tentler et al., 2012</a>). Recently, stem-cell based organoid technology was introduced to establish long-term cultures of both normal and tumor tissues from various organs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Sato et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartfeld et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Boj et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Huch et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Karthaus et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gao et al., 2014</a>). The advantage of this technology is that it can capture the genetic diversity of both normal and tumor tissues. Indeed, for colorectal cancer (CRC) a genetically diverse Biobank of patient-derived CRC organoids was established and used to integrate genomic data and monotherapy drug responses at the level of individual patient-derived organoid lines (<a href=\"#bib34\">van de Wetering et al., 2015</a>)."

We confirm the strong correlation between the presence of mutant RAS and resistance towards EGFR inhibition. Our data reinforce the notion that an oncogenic mutation in <i>RAS</i> is sufficient to confer this resistance independent of cellular status, whether it concerns normal or tumorigenic cells. Moreover, real-time imaging of the resistant drug response at the cellular level reveals predominant cell-cycle arrest in RAS mutant organoids, in contrast with the complete induction of cell death in CRC organoids with WT RAS. In vivo drug response of xenotransplanted RAS mutant CRC organoids confirmed the\u00a0arrest in tumor growth upon dual inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway. Finally, efficient inhibition by dual targeting of the mutant RAS pathway strongly sensitizes for the induction of cell death, as illustrated by minimal addition of BCL inhibition. Our studies demonstrate the strong potential of patient-derived CRC organoid libraries in evaluating inhibitors and drug combinations in a preclinical setting."

We performed EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway inhibition with relatively high concentrations of afatinib (1 \u00b5M) in combination with selumetinib (1 \u00b5M). In P26T (mutant KRAS) we only observed cell cycle arrest with very limited cell death induction. This was in stark contrast with the very rapid induction of cell death in P8T (WT KRAS) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). When we repeated these imaging experiments using much lower drug concentrations, we noticed a general shift to resistance for both organoid lines. Under these conditions, also P8T predominantly showed cell cycle arrest rather than cell death, and the cancer cells in P26T organoids even continued to proliferate (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Taken together, our data indicate that 72 hr of combination treatment with afatinib and selumetinib (EGFRi/HER2i and MEKi) effectively kills KRAS WT P8T organoids, while the mutant KRAS P26T organoids are significantly less sensitive."

In line with a previous report where only engineered tumor progression organoids with increasing number of cancer mutations (APC, KRAS, P53 and/or SMAD4) showed efficient engraftment (<a href=\"#bib11\">Drost et al., 2015</a>), we only obtained reliable engraftment using P26T CRC organoids. We initially started using concentration schedules of afatinib and selumetinib that had previously been reported (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sun et al., 2014</a>), but we observed no significant effect of the drug combination on tumor growth over time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To exclude that the tumors had acquired resistance during the in vivo drug treatment, we isolated the tumors to re-establish secondary organoids and subjected these to identical drug tests. Dose-response curves on these secondary organoids were identical to the parental organoid line P26T, independent of the type of drug treatment that the tumors underwent in the mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, in agreement with lower drug concentrations that proved to be ineffective in blocking proliferation in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), we speculate that the in vivo drug concentrations were insufficient to effectively block the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway. To confirm this hypothesis, we further increased the drug levels to high but tolerable doses. This indeed induced significant growth stabilization (but no regression) of P26T xenotransplanted tumor in mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), in agreement with loss of proliferative activity as was also detected in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The fact that in vivo xenografted CRC organoids yields similar drug responses as in vitro organoid cultures and identical to previous reported drug response of KRAS mutant PDX models of CRC (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sun et al., 2014</a>), validates the testing and evaluation of targeted inhibitors in CRC organoids."

Genomic characterization of these patient-derived CRC organoids in comparison to their matched normal tissue revealed many additional mutations within the protein coding sequence of the genome (<a href=\"#bib34\">van de Wetering et al., 2015</a>). For P8T and P26T, 230 and 163 of such cancer specific mutations were detected respectively (<a href=\"#bib34\">van de Wetering et al., 2015</a>). To exclude potential contributions of all these additional mutations to the effect that oncogenic KRAS imposes on drug responses, we introduced an oncogenic <i>KRAS</i> mutation in patient-derived CRC organoid P18T via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (<a href=\"#bib11\">Drost et al., 2015</a>). Like P8T, original P18T is WT for the entire downstream EGFR signaling pathway. P18T-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> mutant cells were generated as reported previously for normal colon organoids (<a href=\"#bib11\">Drost et al., 2015</a>) and genotyping of clonally expanded organoids confirmed that the clones contained the <i>KRAS<sup>G12D</sup></i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), as well as a Cas9-mediated inactivation of the second allele by introducing an 86 bp deletion. Upon addition of oncogenic KRAS, no overall differences in morphology or growth rates were observed during normal culture conditions."

Since suboptimal suppression of ERK activity might permit tumor growth in BRAF mutant cancers (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bollag et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Corcoran et al., 2015</a>), we determined the cellular effects of drug response when lowering drug concentrations. Since significant differential effects were observed between P18T and P18T-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> during the matrix screen around 33 nM afatinib\u00a0+\u00a0200 nM selumetinib (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), we repeated real-time imaging of drug response using these lower drug concentrations. As with P8T and P26T, we noticed a general shift from sensitivity towards resistance when drug concentrations were reduced. More specifically, the RAS WT cancer organoids showed cell cycle arrest rather than cell death, while the RAS mutant organoids appeared unaffected and sustained proliferation (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

We screened 10 additional patient-derived CRC organoids for combinatorial therapies against the EGFR-RAS-ERK signaling pathway. Since all the organoid lines are fully characterized in terms of genome information, we could select CRC organoids with and without a\u00a0mutant RAS pathway. Based on EGFR/HER2 dual inhibition by afatinib, we could clearly discriminate the organoid panel in two types of responders, namely the sensitive versus the resistant ones (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, green versus red lines respectively). Indeed, drug sensitivity towards all tested EGFR inhibitors clearly correlated with the mutational status of <i>KRAS.</i> However, there were two notable exceptions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The first was P25T, which, although WT for <i>KRAS</i>, turned out to contain an oncogenic mutation in <i>NRAS</i> (Q61H), thereby fully explaining the resistant behavior. The second exception was organoid line P19bT that, unlike the other CRC organoids in our panel, is characterized as microsatellite instable (MSI) including the hyper-mutator phenotype (<a href=\"#bib34\">van de Wetering et al., 2015</a>). Most importantly, P19bT tumor contains a <i>BRAF</i> (V600E) mutation, providing resistance towards the targeted drugs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Di Nicolantonio et al., 2008</a>). Thus, these two cases underscore that drug screening on human organoids is able to evaluate the functionality of entire oncogenic pathways beyond the scope of the most frequent candidate mutations."

In all seven independent CRC patients with a mutant RAS pathway, we observed synergistic activity when combining EGFRi and MEKi (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sun et al., 2014</a>) or EGFRi and ERKi (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Nevertheless, RAS WT organoids, either of CRC or normal origin, reveal higher sensitivities to combination therapies that include EGFR inhibition than RAS mutant CRCs. In contrast, therapies that do not include EGFR inhibition, but target MEK (selumetinib) and ERK (SCH772984), were similarly effective in all organoid lines, regardless of the mutational status of the RAS pathway or cellular state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Combining EGFRi with either MEK or ERKi results in a more consistent inhibitory effect over this set of CRCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, lower panels), thereby not only improving individual responses but also augmenting success rates on a population scale. These findings are supportive to the previously published concept that proposes to combine EGFR with MEK inhibition directly at the start of therapy in patients with WT RAS tumors with the rationale of preventing sub-clones with acquired resistance to anti-EGFR monotherapy from reigniting tumor growth (<a href=\"#bib22\">Misale et al., 2015</a>)."

Similar effects were obtained by combined inhibition of MEK and ERK (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, left panel). Additionally, this experiment shows that the described effects persisted for seven days after drug washout. As expected for P18T-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, suppressing EGFR/HER2 activity upstream of mutant KRAS using afatinib proved ineffective, while monotherapy of MEKi or ERKi inhibited proliferation only to a minor extent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, right panel). Only the inhibitor combinations EGFRi/MEKi and MEKi/ERKi induced complete proliferative stagnation, albeit with minor induction of cell death. Importantly, independent of a\u00a0therapeutic strategy, the CRC organoids quickly restored proliferative activity after drug release. Comparable results were obtained in CRC organoids P8T (KRAS WT) and KRAS mutant P26T, with the exception that cell death induction in P8T was less pronounced than in P18T (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). In summary, these data indicate that inhibition of the EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway, independent of inhibitor combination, predominantly inhibits cell-cycle progression in KRAS mutant CRC organoids."

As opposed to this, it has been reported that combined inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members and effectors of the RAS pathway can effectively induce cell death in KRAS mutant cancers (<a href=\"#bib8\">Corcoran et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hata et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Tan et al., 2013</a>). These results prompted clinical trials to evaluate combined targeting of MEK and BCL2/BCLXL in KRAS mutant solid tumors (NCT02079740). Unfortunately, clinical application of BCL2/BCLXL inhibitors is hindered by on-target toxicity of BCLXL inhibition in blood platelets (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hata et al., 2015</a>) and might therefore strongly benefit from strategies that allow minimized doses."

Indeed, straightforward ATP-based screening confirmed that navitoclax, when combined with afatinib (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, left panel), selumetinib (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, middle panel), or both (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, right panel) is far more efficient in antagonizing tumor organoid growth than any of the related monotherapies. Importantly, regarding the dose-limiting effects of navitoclax, we show that robust dual inhibition of the EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway (1 \u00b5M afatinib/1 \u00b5M selumetinib) is exceptionally potent in sensitizing navitoclax-induced effects (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, right panel).

Cell viability was measured by an ATP-based assay after 72 hr of drug treatment. Inhibition of the EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway using high concentrations of afatinib and selumetinib (1 \u00b5M) strongly sensitizes for navitoclax-induced reduction of cellular viability (right panel, black line). Such strong sensitization could not be achieved by afatinib (1 \u00b5M) alone (left panel, orange line) or selumetinib (1 \u00b5M) alone (middle panel, purple line).

Bar diagram at the right shows quantifications of cell death by scoring propidium-iodide stained nuclei (dead) over viable H2B-labeled nuclei (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods section) of minimal 15 organoids per condition (signals pooled prior ratioing, hence no standard deviation calculated: see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods section).

Color corresponds to targeted inhibitor as indicated in the legend. All values are normalized to control samples (DMSO). Targeting of the RAS pathway does not provide long-lasting effects after drug removal, even combination treatments at high concentrations (green bars).

The\u00a0results of the full matrix screen are represented as heat maps, where red represents 0% ATP levels (no viability) and green represents 100% ATP levels (max viability). Exploring optimal drug concentrations reveal that the more effective inhibition of the RAS pathway is achieved (dual targeting and high concentrations), the less navitoclax is required. Venotoclax, a BCL2-specific inhibitor, is not able to copy the effects of navitoclax (BCL2/BCLXL)."

Intriguingly, drug effects were almost identical in normal organoids and patient-derived CRC organoids when WT for RAS. This may imply that the sensitivity of RAS WT colon cancer for EGFRi is not an acquired oncogene-addiction, but merely represents the dependency of normal colon (stem) cells on EGFR signaling activity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wong et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, normal organoids from the human colon consist predominantly of proliferative stem and progenitor cells due to the WNT ligands in the culture medium. Therefore, the observed toxicity in the normal organoids may very well be most representative for direct effects on the stem cell compartments of the normal colon. Indeed, one of the direct side effects of anti-EGFR monotherapy is diarrhea (<a href=\"#bib21\">Miroddi et al., 2015</a>). In analogy to drug responses with WT RAS, normal organoids harboring a CRISPR-introduced oncogenic <i>KRAS</i> mutation showed resistance profiles towards targeted therapies that closely resemble those of RAS mutant CRC organoids, again underscoring the dominance of the\u00a0RAS mutational status on drug response."

Minimizing navitoclax concentrations would be beneficial due to its on-target effects on BCLXL in circulating platelets, thereby causing thrombocytopenia (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hata et al., 2015</a>).

We believe that organoid collections will facilitate the identification and optimization of effective targeted therapies, since drug screens can be performed at a scale that is currently unprecedented when using resource-intensive PDX models.

(2) Marking of \u2018dead\u2019 pixels in each slice (initially automated, based on particle size and eventually manually by selection). (3) Dividing pixels in dead and alive (total minus dead). (4) Integrating the pixel areas representing alive and dead H2B, respectively, from the slices that make up for the lowest 50% of the organoid volume.

Fluorescence kinetics were plotted over time (as relative fluorescent units (RFU) per hour) to define the linear range of the assay. Cell viability was then defined as the maximum AB fluorescence (RFUmax, within the linear range of the assay), corrected for background fluorescence (RFU at time point 0). Viability data from drug treated organoids were normalized to vehicle (DMSO) treated controls.

The authors use organoids with wildtype KRAS, organoids with mutant KRAS, and normal organoids engineered to express mutant KRAS, and find that KRAS mutational status determines the sensitivity to HER-RAS-ERK axis targeted therapies. While these observations had been previously described in vitro or in clinical trials, one new result is that MEKi/HERi or MEKi/ERKi combinations induce cell cycle arrest rather than cell death. Importantly, addition of BCLi during HERi/MEKi removal induces death. This could have clinical relevance given the platelet toxicity of BCLi. The paper demonstrates the potential of using patient-derived CRC organoids in testing and evaluating combinatorial drug responses."

The chance of artifacts has been reduced by the use of varied inhibitors against common targets and the different approaches to measure cell death. However, the use of organoids for drug screens is not new, CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of KRAS has been reported, and the efficacy of combinations of EGFRi and MEK/ERKi is well-established. Moreover, the reviewers were concerned that there is limited new biology or molecular mechanisms in the paper. For this reason, the reviewers are only willing to consider the paper for <i>eLife</i> if the new findings (of cell stasis rather than death following MEK/EGFRi and of the efficacy of BCLi) are better substantiated."

The authors try to show that the response to targeted therapies is only dependent on KRAS status independently of cellular mutational status, as the results in normal organoids are comparable to cancer ones. I would be more cautious in this respect, as the culture of normal organoids requires high Wnt activity media, growth factors and inhibitors, which may not reflect the normal mucosa in the intestine. Additionally, I find kind of surprising that the introduction of an oncogenic KRAS does not result in oncogenic senescence in a normal organoid. It would be nice to see some organoid pictures in this set of experiments and/or a comparison of WT vs. KRAS-mutant organoids growth curves in absence or treatment."

Both turned out to contain alternative well-known oncogenic mutations in the downstream EGFR signaling pathway, i.e. BRAF (V600E) and NRAS (Q61H). It will be much more challenging in order to find mutations that do not confer complete resistance such as oncogenic KRAS, NRAS or BRAF, but do contribute to such a phenotype. We therefore hesitate to speculate about possible resistance mechanisms imposed by low frequency cancer mutations due to the relative small sample size of organoids. Indeed, we do agree that mechanistic studies on these lower abundant mutation frequencies in relation to drug sensitivity are very interesting, but we consider it beyond the scope of this manuscript."
