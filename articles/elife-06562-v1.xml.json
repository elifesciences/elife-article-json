This study defines the precise positions of T7 helicase and T7 DNAP at the replication fork junction with single-base resolution to create a structural model that explains the mutual stimulation of activities. Our 2-aminopurine studies show that helicase and polymerase both participate in DNA melting, but each enzyme melts the junction base-pair partially. When combined, the junction base-pair is melted cooperatively provided the helicase is located one nucleotide ahead of the primer-end. The synergistic shift in equilibrium of junction base-pair melting by combined enzymes explains the cooperativity, wherein helicase stimulates the polymerase by promoting dNTP binding (decreasing dNTP K<sub>m</sub>), polymerase stimulates the helicase by increasing the unwinding rate-constant (k<sub>cat</sub>), consequently the combined enzymes unwind DNA with kinetic parameters resembling enzymes translocating on single-stranded DNA."
