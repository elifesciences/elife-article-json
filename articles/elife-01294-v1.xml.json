A lot of research has gone into developing computer programs that can identify these variants automatically, but computational approaches have some significant shortcomings, especially when identifying indels in certain types of genomes, such as genomes that are highly repetitive or contain a lot of cytosine (C) and guanine (G) bases. In these situations, the visual acuity and excellent pattern recognition skills of humans can be invaluable and can help us to find these elusive and potentially crucial variants."

To make this challenge manageable, we have selected locations within the reference genome that we know (based on a preliminary analysis of the data) are likely to contain genetic variants and included the bases on either side of these locations to make target patterns that contain a total of 21 bases. We have then extracted all the reads that overlap to some extent with each target pattern. To begin with, the game will only contain data on the pathogens, but the game could be played with data from any species, and we plan to include data on the trees within the next few weeks."

The player can improve the alignment\u2014and, therefore, his or her score\u2014by shifting the whole read pattern, and then hiding individual leaves (to represent a deletion) or introducing a space between two leaves (an insertion). And if there already is a space between two leaves, it can be increased in size or removed."

The target pattern is at the top of the screen and the aim of the game is to align the read patterns with this target. The target pattern is always a 21-base stretch of DNA from a reference genome that is likely to contain a genetic variant; in Fraxinus we are starting with targets taken from a reference genome for <i>C. fraxinea</i>, the pathogen that causes ash dieback disease, but the targets can be chosen from any reference genome. The read patterns used in the game can contain up to 76 bases and, in this case, are taken from samples of an interesting strain of <i>C. fraxinea</i>. The arrow buttons allow each read pattern to be moved left or right, while individual leaves (bases) can be moved, deleted or inserted with click-and-drag movements. The pattern value at the bottom of the screen indicates the player\u2019s score. The bottom screenshot shows the game after the player has shifted the top two reads 14 bases to the left to match the seven bases on the left of the target, and then introduced a 9-base insertion (black circles) to match another three bases towards the right of the target: these moves increase the pattern value to \u221280.

Ultimately this will help us to breed trees that are resistant to ash dieback (or other diseases), to identify treatments, and to plan for better management of our woodlands and tree stocks."
