In budding yeast, cells respond to such stress by expressing a transcription factor called Hac1p. This transcription factor is then transported to the nucleus, where it directs the expression of additional chaperones and other factors that can alleviate the stress (<a href=\"#bib2\">Cox and Walter, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Mori et al., 1996</a>).

However, unspliced <i>HAC1</i> mRNA contains an intron (orange) that, in the absence of endoplasmic reticulum stress, undergoes base-pairing interactions with its own 5\u2019UTR. These interactions prevent most 40S ribosomes (blue oval) from loading onto the mRNA and initiating translation. When the endoplasmic reticulum becomes stressed (middle panel), Ire1 proteins (black triangles) splice out the intron. The spliced <i>HAC1</i> mRNA can then be translated to form the full-length Hac1 protein, which triggers the unfolded protein response in order to relieve endoplasmic reticulum stress. (Right) In the absence of stress, some 40S ribosomes (blue ovals) manage to bypass the base-pairing interactions. In this case, the second exon is not translated, and a new sequence is found at the C-terminal end of the protein (red). This \"degron tag\" is recognized by a protein adaptor called Duh1, which targets Hac1 for ubiquitination \u2013 a process that involves the formation of a complex that also includes E2, Cul1 and Skp1 proteins. This ubiquitination marks the protein for rapid degradation by the proteasome."

However, these results were called into question by ribosome-footprint profiling experiments by Weinberg and others that showed that ribosomes were nearly absent from <i>HAC1</i> transcripts in exponentially growing yeast (<a href=\"#bib9\">Weinberg et al., 2016</a>). Through careful experimentation, Di Santo et al. reveal that the association of <i>HAC1</i> mRNA with polysomes in sucrose gradients was an artifact caused by non-specific interactions. Thus it appears that <i>HAC1</i> is silenced because ribosomes cannot start the translation process."

In sucrose gradient experiments, mutating either the 5\u2019UTR or the intron sequences in order to disrupt the base-pairing interaction resulted in the distribution of the mutant mRNAs being shifted to the polysome fractions. Although this suggested that translation could be initiated on these mutant transcripts, no protein was detectable. Further investigation revealed that the Hac1 protein synthesized from this mRNA variant was unstable because the intron encoded a 10-amino-acid tail that acted as a destruction signal (or \u201cdegron\u201d tag)."

Di Santo et al. overcame this challenge with a number of clever biochemical tricks and genomic screens. These identified a previously unknown protein adapter, Duh1p, which recognizes the degron tag on Hac1 and targets the protein for ubiquitination, marking it for subsequent degradation by the proteasome."

This finding raises the question of whether Duh1p may regulate other proteins and whether similar adaptors exist to regulate other degron tags in the cell. While the Hac1 protein was already known for the unusual way in which it is regulated, these discoveries add yet another plot twist to this fascinating story."
