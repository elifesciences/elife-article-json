We used the budding yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, to ask whether nutrients that must be digested extracellularly select for the evolution of undifferentiated multicellularity. Because yeast use invertase to hydrolyze sucrose extracellularly and import the resulting monosaccharides, single cells cannot grow at low cell and sucrose concentrations. Three engineered strategies overcame this problem: forming multicellular clumps, importing sucrose before hydrolysis, and increasing invertase expression. We evolved populations in low sucrose to ask which strategy they would adopt. Of 12 successful clones, 11 formed multicellular clumps through incomplete cell separation, 10 increased invertase expression, none imported sucrose, and 11 increased hexose transporter expression, a strategy we had not engineered. Identifying causal mutations revealed genes and pathways, which frequently contributed to the evolved phenotype. Our study shows that combining rational design with experimental evolution can help evaluate hypotheses about evolutionary strategies."

We used the budding yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, to ask whether nutrients that must be digested extracellularly select for the evolution of undifferentiated multicellularity. Because yeast use invertase to hydrolyze sucrose extracellularly and import the resulting monosaccharides, single cells cannot grow at low cell and sucrose concentrations. Three engineered strategies overcame this problem: forming multicellular clumps, importing sucrose before hydrolysis, and increasing invertase expression. We evolved populations in low sucrose to ask which strategy they would adopt. Of 12 successful clones, 11 formed multicellular clumps through incomplete cell separation, 10 increased invertase expression, none imported sucrose, and 11 increased hexose transporter expression, a strategy we had not engineered. Identifying causal mutations revealed genes and pathways, which frequently contributed to the evolved phenotype. Our study shows that combining rational design with experimental evolution can help evaluate hypotheses about evolutionary strategies."

Over 95% of this enzyme remains in the cell wall (<a href=\"#bib25\">Esmon et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tammi et al., 1987</a>), where it hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose, which are imported into the cell by a variety of hexose transporters (<a href=\"#bib52\">Meijer et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Reifenberger et al., 1997</a>). Lab yeast strains cannot grow from low density in low concentrations of sucrose because of diffusion: each cell captures only a small fraction of the sugars that sucrose hydrolysis releases, and the molecules released by other, distant cells are at very low concentration. As a result, cells cannot capture enough glucose and fructose to grow. Forming multicellular clumps overcomes this failure; cells in a clump can capture glucose and fructose diffusing from their neighbors and grow in concentrations of sucrose where low concentrations of individual cells cannot."

All but one of the 12 clones selected from 10 independent populations form multicellular clumps as a result of incomplete cell separation, showing that this selection efficiently selects for multicellularity. In addition, 10 of the clones elevated invertase expression and 11 elevated hexose transporter expression, a strategy that we failed to anticipate, but none showed evidence of sucrose import. We combined bulk segregant analysis (<a href=\"#bib53\">Michelmore et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brauer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Segr\u00e8 et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Birkeland et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Magwene et al., 2011</a>) with whole genome sequencing to identify putative causal mutations.

We experimentally evolved multiple, parallel cultures to grow well on low sucrose. Ten independent populations of budding yeast were serially diluted in minimal, 1 mM sucrose-containing medium. The starting strain for each population was a haploid, non-clumpy, prototrophic strain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) that constitutively expressed YFP and carried a DNA polymerase mutation (<i>POL3-L523D</i>) that elevated its mutation rate roughly 100-fold (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jin et al., 2005</a>). We used a mutator strain to increase the speed of adaptation. At each growth cycle, 5\u00d710<sup>5</sup> cells were inoculated into 50 ml of medium (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Over 25\u201335 serial dilutions, the time it took the culture to become cloudy fell from 2 weeks to 3 days, and all 10 populations (named EvoPopulation1\u201310) displayed a clumpy phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

Wild yeast isolates can form multicellular clumps in two ways: flocculation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Guo et al., 2000</a>), in which separate cells stick to each other via cell wall-bound adhesins, or failure to separate daughters from their mothers because the cell wall that joins them is not digested after cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib79\">Yvert et al., 2003</a>). To find which method the evolved clones used, we co-cultured two different colored versions of each evolved clone, using constitutive expression of different fluorescent proteins to mark the two versions. If the clumps formed by flocculation, many clumps would contain cells of both colors; if cells fail to separate, each clump would contain only one color since it would arise by the repeated division of a single cell."

We suspect many of these genes may show differences in expression because the evolved clones grow much more rapidly than their ancestors in low sucrose medium. <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a> lists the genes whose expression was increased or decreased at least tenfold in each of the ten evolved clones we examined. All of the approximately 1500 genes with significant expression level changes are listed in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">supplementary file 1C</a> along with their level of change in each evolved clone."

But since we had shown that engineering sucrose import allowed growth on low sucrose, we needed to rule out the possibility that some of the evolved clones were using this strategy. If an evolved clone depended on sucrose import, keeping it from secreting invertase would have little effect on its growth in sucrose. To test for this possibility, we removed the signal sequence (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kaiser and Botstein, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Perlman et al., 1986</a>) that directs Suc2's secretion from each of the evolved clones (now named EvoCloneX-<i>suc2-1cyt</i>) and competed these derivatives against the corresponding, unmodified, evolved clone. In each case, the evolved clone quickly outcompeted the version that did not secrete invertase (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>), demonstrating that growth of all the evolved clones depends on secreted invertase. To verify that this growth defect was not due to reduction in invertase expression, we measured, using reverse transcription followed by quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), the <i>SUC2</i> expression of the two evolved clones (EvoClone2 and EvoClone9) and their <i>suc2-1cyt</i> counterparts grown in 1 mM glucose. In both cases, expression of <i>SUC2</i> was slightly greater in the <i>suc2-1cyt</i> strain but statistically insignificant over three independent trials."

Two genes, <i>ACE2</i> and <i>UBR1,</i> were mutated in at least half the clones, and groups of genes in three pathways, involved in glucose sensing (the <i>RGT1</i> group), growth regulation (the <i>IRA1/IRA2</i> group), and transcription (the Mediator group) were also mutated in many clones. We suspect that most of the putative causal mutations are loss of function mutations. Many alleles of the two most frequently mutated genes, <i>ACE2</i> and <i>UBR1</i> were nonsense mutations. In addition, amongst the 39 genes that were only mutated once, 12 (31%) of the mutations were nonsense mutations. This suggests that many of the mutations in the remaining 27 genes are loss of function mutations: for two genes that have been extensively studied, <i>URA3</i> and <i>CAN1</i>, 31% of strong loss of function mutations are nonsense mutations (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lang and Murray, 2008</a>).

The primary selective force for four of these six mutations is likely to be their ability to produce multicellularity: an <i>ace2</i>\u0394 strain is morphologically similar to EvoClone2 and a <i>mck1-G227Vfs249 irc8-G57V gin4-W19*</i> strain is morphologically similar to EvoClone9 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Each of these two strains also outcompetes the ancestor strain in low sucrose but not in low monosaccharide (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This shows that multicellular clumps were specifically selected by growth in low sucrose, rather than being a general response to low sugar concentrations. But clumpiness alone was not sufficient to match the growth of the evolved strains in sucrose\u2014the engineered clumpy strain (EngClumpy) was not as fit in 1 mM sucrose as one of the evolved clones that had similar clump size (EvoClone2) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

The first is a direct result of selection: some mutations that improve growth on low sucrose reduce fitness on high glucose. The second appeals to the large number of mutations that hitchhiked with the causal mutations: some of the hitchhikers are neutral on low sucrose, but slow cell growth on high glucose. We distinguished these two possibilities by competing the evolved and recreated strains against their ancestor in high glucose. For both EvoClone2 and EvoClone9, the recreated strains performed as well as or better than the evolved clones, but worse than the ancestor, suggesting that both causal alleles and hitchhiking alleles contribute to the evolved clones' reduced fitness in high glucose."

RNA sequencing revealed two additional strategies that most clones used: 10 elevated invertase expression, a strategy we had engineered, and 11 elevated hexose transporter expression, a strategy we had not engineered. We found no evidence of another strategy we had engineered: sucrose import. We cannot eliminate the possibility that the clones import some sucrose, but when we kept cells from secreting invertase, their fitness in low sucrose was severely reduced, showing that their growth still depends on invertase secretion. We identified the mutations that led to increased growth on low sucrose and showed that these were necessary and sufficient to recreate the evolved phenotype in two of the evolved clones. The genes that were mutated identified pathways that control cell growth and nutrient utilization."

First, none of the evolved clones had a strong fitness advantage over the ancestor in 1 mM glucose plus 1 mM fructose, the monosaccharide equivalent of 1 mM sucrose (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) showing that these clones were specifically adapted to sucrose. Second, a strain that was engineered to be clumpy (EngClumpy) outcompeted the ancestor in low sucrose, but not low monosaccharide (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), demonstrating that low sucrose concentrations specifically selects for clumps, reinforcing our earlier findings on engineered multicellularity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Koschwanez et al., 2011</a>).

Most (10 out of 12) of the evolved clones had increased invertase expression, even though the strain we had engineered to have high invertase expression had only a small advantage over a wild-type strain (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The advantage of increased invertase expression in a shaken culture of single cells is likely to be small since all cells share the monosaccharides that escape from the small, unstirred volume that surrounds each cell. But high invertase expression makes sense in conjunction with the other two strategies we observed, multicellularity and elevated monosaccharide import. In a clump, multiple cells share a larger unstirred volume and have preferential access to the monosaccharides their neighbors release (<a href=\"#bib37\">Koschwanez et al., 2011</a>). Increasing invertase expression will increase the rate of sucrose hydrolysis, and making more hexose transporters will increase the fraction of the monosaccharides that are imported rather than escaping to the bulk medium. Thus we expect that increasing invertase expression, making cell clumps, and making more hexose transporters will act together to increase fitness on low sucrose. Because low extracellular glucose induces the expression of both high affinity hexose transporters and invertase, it is likely that single mutations can increase levels of both types of proteins. In addition, clumpiness may indirectly elevate invertase expression: because secreted invertase expression peaks at roughly 0.5 mM external glucose (<a href=\"#bib37\">Koschwanez et al., 2011</a>), clumps may increase invertase expression because concentrating the cells in space collectively raises the local glucose concentration."

As the level of potential nutrients in their environment falls, cells must make choices: how much of their resources they invest in trying to harvest nutrients from their environment, and how much of the imported nutrients they store to meet future challenges and how much they use to maximize their current growth rate. As an example, wild strains may stop growing and dividing at low external glucose levels because this decision improves their ability to survive if glucose levels continued to fall, even though they could support cell growth at the current glucose concentration if they expressed very high levels of hexose transporters and stored no sugar as glycogen. Influences on this type of decision are likely to explain repeated mutations in one gene (<i>UBR1</i>) and three groups of genes, which control glucose's effect on transcription (the <i>RGT1</i> group), how nutrient availability controls cell growth (the <i>IRA</i> group), and general transcription (the Mediator group)."

We combined engineering, experimental evolution, bulk segregant analysis, and genetic reconstruction to build a picture of how budding yeast evolve in response to a specific challenge: the need to grow on a nutrient that is released into the local environment by extracellular hydrolysis. Testing hypothetical strategies by engineering allowed us to look for their phenotypic signatures, such as the increased expression of hydrolytic enzymes, in evolved populations. Having a method to sift the minority of causal mutations from the majority of hitchhikers allowed us to use mutators and increase the speed of evolution. The ability to swap evolved and ancestral alleles made it possible to verify our methods for identifying causal mutations and show that we had identified mutations that were either generalists, promoting growth across all the environments we tested, or specialists showing antagonistic pleiotropy by being strongly beneficial in one environment and deleterious in another. Finally, performing multiple experiments in parallel allowed us to identify mutations in particular genes and pathways as contributing strongly to evolutionary success."

The formation of multicellular clumps allows the hydrolysis products to be shared among direct kin and reduces the risk of cheating (<a href=\"#bib37\">Koschwanez et al., 2011</a>).

The target size for mutations in these enzymes and the control circuits that regulate their production will be large, making it easy to evolve undifferentiated multicellularity. Although lab strains of yeast were selected to be unicellular during their domestication (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mortimer and Johnston, 1986</a>), the level of clumpiness varies in wild isolates of yeast, and undifferentiated multicellularity may have been recurrently selected for its advantage in harvesting nutrients or for protection from stress (<a href=\"#bib68\">Smukalla et al., 2008</a>). Organisms without a cell wall, such as animal cells, would need another innovation, such as cell-adhering cadherins (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abedin and King, 2008</a>), in order to evolve multicellular clumps.

This disparity has received a large amount of attention in paleontology, particularly in the context of the seemingly rapid radiation of the animals at the base of the Cambrian. Possible explanations for this \u2018Cambrian explosion' include novel selective forces due to the environmental changes that occurred shortly before the Cambrian or the possibility that evolutionary arms races among a few early species drove the radiation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Marshall, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Peters and Gaines, 2012</a>). Alternatively, the evolution of differentiated multicellularity may have been slow and gradual and we simply lack the fossil evidence.

We therefore used a qualitative microscopy-based fitness assay to compare growth of a YFP-labeled population and a CFP-labeled population. We started the competitions by growing each population separately to saturation in 1 mM glucose + 1 mM fructose. Equal volumes of each strain were mixed together, and then checked under a microscope to verify that both strains were equally present. 50 \u00b5l of the mixed culture was then inoculated into 10 ml of the test media.

The two versions of each strain were grown separately in 1 mM glucose + 1 mM fructose media to saturation, and then the two versions were vortexed or sonicated (both gave identical results) for 10 s and then combined at low density in fresh 1 mM sucrose media. The mixed cultures were grown to visible density at 30\u00b0C and then pipetted into a well of a glass-bottomed 96-well plate and examined by microscope. In each of the three independent experiments, at least 50 clumps were checked and three representative images were taken for each strain."

The colony was grown overnight in YPD (10 g/l yeast extract, 20 g/l peptone, and 2% [w/v] dextrose) and selected on 5FOA plates to identify cells in which the <i>URA3</i> construct had looped out (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boeke et al., 1984</a>). Colonies that grew were streaked out on 5FOA, replica plated to YP 2% Acetate (20 g/l agar, 10 g/l yeast extract, 20 g/l peptone, and 2% [w/v] potassium acetate) to eliminate petites, and the target region was amplified and sequenced to ensure that only the desired allele was present.

Sucrose utilization in budding yeast is unusual as it must be hydrolyzed extracellularly by invertase, resulting in glucose and fructose, which can then be imported into the cell. In low sucrose conditions, cells can't grow when they exist as single cells as hydrolyzed glucose and fructose is lost through diffusion. However, the authors have previously shown that if cells are engineered to clump together they can grow in this condition. This is presumably because the local concentration of the products of sucrose hydrolysis (glucose and fructose) is sufficiently high for cells to grow when they clump but not when they are present as individual cells. In this paper the authors have performed a long-term selection in which wild type, non-clumpy cells were propagated by serial dilution in an environment containing low sucrose. They find that this condition does indeed result in selection for clumpy cells. In addition, most of the clones that they analyze have increased expression of the invertase gene (SUC2) and, surprisingly, increased expression of a large number of hexose transporter genes. The authors used a mutator strain and thus mutants with increased fitness have acquired a large number of mutations. To identify causative alleles the authors performed bulk segregant analysis, which allowed them to identify the likely alleles that confer increased fitness. They prove that a fitness increase is attributable to some of these mutations by engineering strains containing only these mutations in addition to reverting acquired mutations in the evolved strains. They speculate that clumping of unicellular organisms may have led to the development of multicellularity."

Indeed, there is suggestive evidence of undifferentiated eukaryotic multicellularity 2 billion years ago (El Albani et al. 2010), but the radiation of more complex multicellularity is not seen for over a billion years later. This disparity has received a large amount of attention in paleontology, particularly in the context of the seemingly rapid radiation of the animals at the base of the Cambrian. Possible explanations for this \u201cCambrian explosion\u201d include novel selective forces due to the environmental changes that occurred shortly before the Cambrian or the possibility that evolutionary arms races among a few early species drove the radiation (Marshall 2006; Peters and Gaines 2012). Alternatively, the evolution of differentiated multicellularity may have been slow and gradual and we simply lack the fossil evidence. Whatever the case, it is interesting to ask why the first differentiation might have arisen. From our data, we speculate that the effectiveness of clumping as a strategy could be improved if a limited number of cells increase their enzyme secretion. Such a simple division of labor may have been the precursor to complex multicellularity in the lineages that lead to animals and other complex multicellular species.\u201d"
