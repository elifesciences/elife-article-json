Our analysis unravels that, beginning from E12.5 until E16.5, the NG2<sup>+</sup> glia populate the entire dorsal telencephalon. Interestingly, their appearance temporally coincides with the establishment of blood vessel network in the embryonic brain. NG2<sup>+</sup> glia are closely apposed to developing cerebral vessels by being either positioned at the sprouting tip cells or tethered along the vessel walls. Absence of NG2<sup>+</sup> glia drastically affects the vascular development leading to severe reduction of ramifications and connections by E18.5. By revealing a novel and fundamental role for NG2<sup>+</sup> glia, our study brings new perspectives to mechanisms underlying proper vessels network formation in embryonic brains."
