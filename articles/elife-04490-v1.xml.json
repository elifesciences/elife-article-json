This may arise from diverse functional traits among species. In fact, genetic diversity within species can have similarly large effects. However, studies of intraspecific genetic diversity have used genotypes varying in several complex traits, obscuring the specific phenotypic variation responsible for community-level effects. Using lines of the wild tobacco <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i> genetically altered in specific well-characterized defense traits and planted into experimental populations in their native habitat, we investigated community-level effects of trait diversity in populations of otherwise isogenic plants. We conclude that the frequency of defense traits in a population can determine the outcomes of these traits for individuals. Furthermore, our results suggest that some ecosystem-level services afforded by genetically diverse plant populations could be recaptured in intensive monocultures engineered to be functionally diverse."

This may arise from diverse functional traits among species. In fact, genetic diversity within species can have similarly large effects. However, studies of intraspecific genetic diversity have used genotypes varying in several complex traits, obscuring the specific phenotypic variation responsible for community-level effects. Using lines of the wild tobacco <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i> genetically altered in specific well-characterized defense traits and planted into experimental populations in their native habitat, we investigated community-level effects of trait diversity in populations of otherwise isogenic plants. We conclude that the frequency of defense traits in a population can determine the outcomes of these traits for individuals. Furthermore, our results suggest that some ecosystem-level services afforded by genetically diverse plant populations could be recaptured in intensive monocultures engineered to be functionally diverse."

The geneticist <a href=\"#bib23\">Dobzhansky (1973)</a> echoed Darwin's view: \u2018It is evident that the differences among proteins at the levels of species, genus, family, order, class, and phylum are compounded of elements that vary also among individuals within a species\u2019. It has also long been known that intraspecific genetic variation in plants can alter ecological community structure; for example, in 1960, De Wit reported that the reproductive output in mixtures of the grass species <i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i> and <i>Phleum pratens</i> depended on associations of particular genotypes (<a href=\"#bib21\">De Wit, 1960</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allard and Adams, 1969</a>).

Specifically, we manipulated direct defenses: traits which directly reduce plant fitness loss to herbivores, and indirect defenses: traits which attract enemies of herbivores which remove or impair herbivores, and thereby indirectly reduce plant fitness loss to herbivores. <i>N. attenuata</i>'s direct and indirect defenses, their biosynthesis and ecological functions have been characterized in detail over two decades of research (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib73\">Schuman and Baldwin, 2012</a>). The direct defenses comprise a suite of chemical traits, most of which are induced by herbivory via jasmonate signaling, and genetically silencing these defenses causes significant changes in herbivore communities (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kessler et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gaquerel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kallenbach et al., 2012</a>). <i>N. attenuata</i> also produces a complex blend of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) which can be parsed into terpenoids, GLVs and other fatty acid derivatives, and aromatics, and are regulated by elicitors in herbivore oral secretions (OS) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gaquerel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Schuman et al., 2009</a>). Of these, the jasmonate-regulated sesquiterpene (<i>E</i>)-\u03b1-bergamotene (TAB) and the GLVs have been shown to reduce herbivore loads by attracting predators, which for the GLVs has also been shown to result in greater plant fitness (<a href=\"#bib35\">Halitschke et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Halitschke et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Schuman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schuman et al., 2012</a>).

LOX2 and LOX3 provide fatty acid hydroperoxides from 18:2 and 18:3 fatty acids (18:2/18:3-OOH) for the synthesis of green leaf volatiles (GLVs) or jasmonic acid (JA) and the jasmonate-derived hormones, respectively. GLVs are released in response to herbivore damage, and jasmonates regulate the production of most anti-herbivore defenses, including trypsin protease inhibitors (TPIs), and other HIPVs. LOX2 and LOX3 were transgenically silenced using an inverted repeat (ir) construct specifically silencing both (<i>lox2/3</i>). Jasmonate-regulated volatiles in <i>N. attenuata</i> are mostly sesquiterpenes, of which the most prevalent is TAB, and include trace amounts of the biosynthetically related sesquiterpene TBF. The <i>Z. mays</i> sesquiterpene synthase <i>TPS10</i> (K\u00f6llner et al., 2009), which produces TAB and TBF as its main products, was ectopically over-expressed in <i>N. attenuata</i> plants under control of a 35S promoter (<i>TPS10</i>) to uncouple the emission of these volatiles from endogenous jasmonate signaling.

In contrast, ovipositing <i>T. mucorea</i> mothers may be attracted to <i>TPS10</i> volatiles (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>).

But what happens when plants \u2018cry wolf\u2019 by constitutively emitting volatiles which, in nature, are only associated with herbivore damage?

The counting was done by a team of two people in parallel moving down the plot in the same direction, so as to complete counts as quickly as possible and to avoid disturbing plants prior to counting. Plants were randomly assigned to each counter. Counting proceeded by looking at each branch of the plant in a systematic order from the top to the bottom of the plant, observing both the adaxial and abaxial sides of leaves as well as full areas of stems. In this way especially mobile arthropods which tend to feed near the top of plants were either counted before they fled (<i>Epitrix</i> spp.), or could be counted once they had relocated to the base of the plant (<i>T. notatus</i>)."

Native <i>Manduca</i> spp. did not provide sufficient synchronously oviposited eggs for trials, and so we used <i>M. sexta</i> eggs kindly provided by C Miles from her laboratory colony at Binghamton University, Vestal, New York. Size-matched plants with health indices \u22652 in populations were used. We treated LOX2/3-expressing (WT, TPS10) and <i>LOX2/3</i>-deficient (<i>lox2/3</i>, <i>lox2/3</i>x<i>TPS10</i>) populations as two separate experimental groups because it was not possible to match plants across these two groups for apparent health or replicate numbers (both were lower for <i>lox2/3</i> and <i>lox2/3</i>x<i>TPS10</i> populations). During the five predation assays it was occasionally necessary to select new plants, preventing a repeated measures analysis of the predation data; however, newly selected plants were matched as described. At the end of predation assays, tissue samples were taken from a subset of these plants for the extraction of volatiles and determination of TPI activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 3</a> and preceding methods)."

Larvae were considered to be predated when either the larva was missing, but clearly identifiable, fresh <i>M. sexta</i> feeding damage was present, or when the predated larval carcass was found on the same plant; eggs were considered predated when the eggshell was empty but intact, except for a small hole which characterizes the typical damage caused by <i>Geocoris</i> spp<i>.</i> feeding as described in <a href=\"#bib50\">Kessler and Baldwin (2001)</a> and depicted in Figure 3 of <a href=\"#bib73\">Schuman et al.

The results would be much clearer to the readers, and avoid many of the concerns over multiple comparisons, if the authors used generalized linear models that better reflect the experimental design (see below for specific suggestion). For instance, the strongest results for their \u201ccommunity genetics\u201d argument comes from the pattern of reduced mortality of <i>lox2/3</i> vs. WT plants when in the presence of a <i>TPS10</i> plant (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), but you do not test this directly. This pattern should be tested as an interaction between the <i>lox</i> and <i>TPS</i> treatments. You interpret this pattern strongly, but all of the tests performed show marginal or non-significant differences (a marginal decline in mortality for <i>lox2/3</i> plants and a non-significant increase in mortality for WT plants due to the presence of a <i>TPS10</i> plant). A similar model could be used for stem borer infestation and predation rates.

The test of whether the presence of a <i>TPS10</i> plant alters mortality on non-<i>TPS10</i> neighbors differently based on the <i>LOX</i> genotype of those neighbors would come from the interaction term in this model, with the <i>TPS10</i> producing plant individuals excluded (and thus the <i>TPS10</i> monoculture treatment dropped). Or alternatively, you could drop the individual plant treatments and have a three way factorial model of <i>LOX</i> genotype*population treatment (mono WT, mono <i>TPS10</i>, mixed)*position (Center vs. Edge).

The authors made some attempt to respond to this suggestion, providing revamped analyses for plant size, flower number, and herbivore damage. However, I was disappointed to see that they did not collect their data in a way that would allow this more powerful analyses of the plant mortality data (which is the clearest case of \u201cextended phenotypes\u201d where the genotype of the center plant affected the fitness of the edge plants), or the data on stem borer abundance and predation rates. For the mortality data especially, this is surprising to me: why would the authors not have noted the live/dead status of plants individually, rather than just taking a tally? Do they mean that within a given population of five plants, they tallied the total number dead (1-5), or do they really mean that they cannot ascribe their mortality data even to the plot level (the base unit of replication for their experiment). If it is the former, they could still use a binomial generalized linear model, as long as they kept the data from the center and edge plants separately. If it is the latter, this is concerning to me because this analysis does not reflect the psuedoreplication induced by having five plants per plot. While a G test is \u201cunreplicated\u201d in that you need only enter a single frequency, it still assumes that the individuals comprising those frequencies are independent observations (i.e. a comparison between 28/75 vs. 50/75 is more powerful than 6/15 vs. 10/15). And I am truly puzzled as to how the authors can have data on flower production at an individual plant scale, but not have mortality data on that scale. Surely if they know how many flowers any given plant produced, they must know if it was alive or not. Am I missing something obvious here?\u201d"

Thus an unreplicated analysis such as the G-test, according to our understanding, must be used. The predation assays were not always conducted on exactly the same group of plants, as over the course of the 5 repetitions some plants were damaged by wind or severed by cutworms and new plants had to be assigned. Thus it would be difficult to appropriately apportion error to a random or repeated-measures term in a model, and we feel it is most appropriate for these data as well to treat them as total frequencies and conduct an unreplicated statistical analysis.

The authors made some attempt to respond to this suggestion, providing revamped analyses for plant size, flower number, and herbivore damage. However, I was disappointed to see that they did not collect their data in a way that would allow this more powerful analyses of the plant mortality data (which is the clearest case of \u201cextended phenotypes\u201d where the genotype of the center plant affected the fitness of the edge plants), or the data on stem borer abundance and predation rates. For the mortality data especially, this is surprising to me: why would the authors not have noted the live/dead status of plants individually, rather than just taking a tally? Do they mean that within a given population of five plants, they tallied the total number dead (1-5), or do they really mean that they cannot ascribe their mortality data even to the plot level (the base unit of replication for their experiment). If it is the former, they could still use a binomial generalized linear model, as long as they kept the data from the center and edge plants separately. If it is the latter, this is concerning to me because this analysis does not reflect the psuedoreplication induced by having five plants per plot. While a G test is \u201cunreplicated\u201d in that you need only enter a single frequency, it still assumes that the individuals comprising those frequencies are independent observations (i.e. a comparison between 28/75 vs. 50/75 is more powerful than 6/15 vs. 10/15). And I am truly puzzled as to how the authors can have data on flower production at an individual plant scale, but not have mortality data on that scale. Surely if they know how many flowers any given plant produced, they must know if it was alive or not. Am I missing something obvious here?\u201d</i>"
