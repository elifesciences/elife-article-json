While increased NAD<sup>+</sup> or decreased NMN levels are thought to be critical to this process, the mechanism(s) of this axon protection remain obscure. Using steady-state and flux analysis of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolites in healthy and injured mouse dorsal root ganglion axons, we find that rather than altering NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis, NMNAT1 instead blocks the injury-induced, SARM1-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption that is central to axon degeneration."

While increased NAD<sup>+</sup> or decreased NMN levels are thought to be critical to this process, the mechanism(s) of this axon protection remain obscure. Using steady-state and flux analysis of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolites in healthy and injured mouse dorsal root ganglion axons, we find that rather than altering NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis, NMNAT1 instead blocks the injury-induced, SARM1-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption that is central to axon degeneration."

The discovery of the Wallerian degeneration slow (Wlds) protein, which dramatically delays axon degeneration after injury, raised hopes that blocking this process would be useful in the treatment of neurological disorders (<a href=\"#bib4\">Conforti et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Mack et al., 2001</a>). The Wlds protein blocks axon degeneration by mislocalizing the nuclear nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT1 into axons, thereby substituting for the loss of the labile axon maintenance factor NMNAT2 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Araki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Babetto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gilley et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Sasaki et al., 2010</a>). The mechanism by which NMNAT enzymes block axon degeneration is unknown. These enzymes synthesize NAD<sup>+</sup> from nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and ATP, so two candidate mechanisms for how loss of NMNAT2 triggers axon degeneration have emerged: (1) the loss of NAD<sup>+</sup> or (2) the accumulation of NMN. The striking axonal protection provided by neuronal expression of <i>Escherichia coli</i> NMN deamidase, which reduces NMN levels by converting it to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN), supports the model that NMN accumulation triggers axon degeneration (<a href=\"#bib5\">Di Stefano et al., 2015</a>). Here we investigate NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism in healthy and injured axons through the measurement of steady-state metabolite levels and via the analysis of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolite synthesis and consumption (i.e. flux analysis). Surprisingly, we find that neither NAD<sup>+</sup> loss nor NMN accumulation trigger axon degeneration. Instead, both NMNAT1 and NMN deamidase prevent axon degeneration via blocking the injury-induced NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption that occurs following activation of the axodestructive molecule SARM1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gerdts et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Osterloh et al., 2012</a>)."

To raise intracellular NMN levels we expressed the NMN biosynthetic enzyme NAMPT or applied nicotinamide riboside (NR) to neurons expressing NRK1, a nicotinamide riboside kinase that converts NR to NMN. To reduce NMN levels we treated neurons with the NAMPT inhibitor FK866 or expressed <i>E. coli</i> NMN deamidase (<a href=\"#bib5\">Di Stefano et al., 2015</a>). We also tested the potent axoprotective cytoplasmic version of NMNAT1 (cytNMNAT1), which appears to substitute in axons for the short-lived NMNAT2 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gilley et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">Sasaki et al., 2009a</a>). The expression of these enzymes in axons was confirmed by Western blotting (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using our automated image analysis axon degeneration assay, and consistent with previous reports, all of these manipulations delayed axon degeneration although to dramatically different extents (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b,c</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Di Stefano et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Sasaki et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2009b</a>). FK866 and NR treatment provided only modest protection, delaying axon degeneration by ~6 to 9\u2009hr. Neurons expressing NRK1 and treated with NR or expressing NAMPT showed strong axon protection for 24 to 48\u2009hr. The strongest axonal protection was found in neurons expressing cytNMNAT1 or NMN deamidase, which both block axon degeneration for at least 3 days after axotomy."

Nicotinamide (Nam) is the major NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor in mammals. It is converted to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) by the NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) enzyme, and then to NAD<sup>+</sup> by the NMNAT (nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylytransferase) enzymes. There are three isoforms of NMNAT in mammalian cells; NMNAT1, 2, and 3. NMN deamidase is a bacterial enzyme that converts NMN to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). NMN synthetase is also a bacterial enzyme that performs the reverse reaction and converts NaMN to NMN. NaMN is converted to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD) by NMNAT1, 2, or 3. NaAD Is converted to NAD<sup>+</sup> by NAD synthetase. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is an alternative NADprecursor that is converted to NMN by NRK1 or NRK2 (nicotinamide riboside kinase enzymes).

In contrast, NAMPT expression or pre-incubation with NR in the presence of NRK1 significantly increased both NMN and NAD<sup>+\u00a0</sup>levels. NMN deamidase significantly increased the levels of NaMN and NaAD while dramatically reducing NMN and NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in DRG neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,c</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Despite reducing NAD<sup>+</sup> levels to 11 \u00b1 7% of control, NMN deamidase-expressing neurons showed no signs of cell death or axon degeneration, but instead displayed potent axonal protection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>) as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib5\">Di Stefano et al., 2015</a>).

We plated neurons in such a manner that we could harvest axons separate from cell bodies and thereafter use LC-MS/MS to measure axon-specific metabolite levels. These studies showed a dramatic decline in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels after injury in control axons, consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib5\">Di Stefano et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gerdts et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Wang et al., 2005</a>). We also found a ~2-fold increase in the levels of NMN within the first two hours after injury. NMN levels declined back to those observed in uninjured axons by six hours post-axotomy. A previous report showed that sciatic nerve transection causes a continuous increase in nerve NMN concentration when it is normalized to the nerve adenylate pool (<a href=\"#bib5\">Di Stefano et al., 2015</a>). We confirm this finding using purified axon preparations, however, we demonstrate that this is due to a rapid decline in the adenylate pool rather than an increase in NMN levels (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 3</a>). We next assessed NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolites in axons that are robustly protected from axotomy-induced degeneration to determine whether these treatments are correlated with a specific metabolite profile. In cells expressing the strongly axoprotective cytNMNAT1, axonal NAD<sup>+</sup> and NMN were comparable to baseline levels in uninjured axons of control neurons and these metabolite levels did not change after axotomy. Expression of NMN deamidase reduced axonal NAD<sup>+</sup> and NMN compared with control axons, and these metabolite levels did not change after axotomy. In contrast, axons from neurons expressing NAMPT had high levels of both NAD<sup>+</sup> and NMN at baseline and at six hours after axotomy. In axons from neurons expressing NRK1 and treated with NR there was a dramatic increase of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NMN levels at baseline. After injury, these axons showed a robust decrease in NAD<sup>+</sup> but further increases in NMN. Indeed, NMN levels in axons from these neurons were 16-fold higher than in control axons (0.16 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b5M vs. 0.01 \u00b1 0.001 \u00b5M, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>), yet these axons were strongly protected from degeneration (&gt;48\u2009hr). These results demonstrate that even within injured axons, elevated levels of NMN do not promote axon degeneration but rather can be compatible with robust axonal protection."

Hence, we sought to determine whether maintaining low NMN levels is necessary for the axoprotective function of NMN deamidase. We approached this problem by attempting to maintain normal NMN levels in neurons expressing <i>E. coli</i> NMN deamidase and then assessing whether axons now degenerate after axotomy. To this end, we utilized an enzyme from <i>Francisella tularensis</i> called NMN synthetase that catalyzes the conversion of NaMN to NMN (i.e., the reverse of the reaction catalyzed by <i>E. coli</i> NMN deamidase) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When we expressed NMN synthetase alone in neurons no changes in any of the measured metabolites were observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>), and injured axons from these neurons degenerated normally (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). However, when NMN synthetase was co-expressed along with NMN deamidase, the normal NMN deamidase-catalyzed reductions in NMN and NAD<sup>+</sup> as well as the increases in NaMN and NaAD are largely abolished (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Furthermore, the addition of the NMN precursor NR to neurons co-expressing <i>F. tularensis</i> NMN synthetase and <i>E. coli</i> NMN deamidase raised axonal NMN well above control levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Despite this elevation in NMN levels under these conditions, NMN deamidase continued to provide robust axon protection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). In addition, we also found that protection of injured axons did not correlate with levels of NAD<sup>+</sup>, NaMN, or NaAD. Hence, neither a reduction in NMN nor the accumulation of NaMN/NaAD is necessary for NMN deamidase mediated axonal protection. These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the axonal NMN level is a driver of axon degeneration."

To interrogate the processes of NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis and degradation independently, we developed an axonal NAD<sup>+</sup> flux assay. The nicotinamide (Nam) in the\u00a0DRG culture medium was largely replaced with deuterium-labeled nicotinamide (D4-Nam: 2,4,5,6-deutrium Nam, 300 \u00b5M) to achieve a 10-fold excess over the original Nam concentration in culture medium). The addition of up to 1\u2009mM of this NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor did not alter the time course of axon degeneration (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>) and allowed us to identify its labeled-NAD<sup>+</sup> derivative using LC-MS/MS. We added labeled Nam at time zero, and followed its conversion by quantifying non-labeled (light) and labeled (heavy) NAD<sup>+</sup> in axons using LC-MS/MS at various times after addition. Conversion of the NAD<sup>+</sup> pool from light to heavy was observed without delay, demonstrating that D4-Nam replaces Nam for NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The increase in heavy NAD<sup>+</sup> following D4-Nam addition gives a measure of the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic rate, while the loss of light NAD<sup>+</sup> reflects the NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption rate. In uninjured axons steady-state NAD<sup>+</sup> (summation of heavy and light NAD<sup>+</sup>) was constant due to ongoing and balanced NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis (6.9 \u00b1 1.4% per hour) and NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption (8.2 \u00b1 3.1% per hour) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Next we compared basal NAD<sup>+</sup> flux in uninjured axons under various axoprotective conditions. NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis enzymes were expressed and axonal NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption rates were measured at 4\u2009hr post D4-Nam addition. Absolute NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption rates were normalized to ATP levels, which are constant in uninjured axons. We found that axon NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption in uninjured axons was similar to wild type levels in SARM1 KO neurons as well as neurons overexpressing cytNMNAT1. NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption was lower in axons from NMN deamidase-expressing neurons and higher in axons from NAMPT-expressing neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>). Since NAD<sup>+</sup> levels are at equilibrium in these uninjured axons, these changes in NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption are balanced by equivalent changes in NAD<sup>+</sup> production. Hence, basal levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> flux are well correlated with steady-state NAD<sup>+</sup> levels (lower in NMN deamidase-expressing neurons and higher in NAMPT-expressing neurons) but not with the axonal protection phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,c</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results are expected since NMN deamidase inhibits NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis by reducing the levels of NMN whereas NAMPT promotes NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis by increasing the levels of NMN. NMN is the rate limiting metabolite in the NAD <sup>+</sup>biosynthetic pathway (<a href=\"#bib18\">Revollo et al., 2004</a>)."

In axotomized axons, steady-state NAD<sup>+</sup> levels declined as previously reported. We now show that this is due to a large increase in the NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption rate (from 8.5 \u00b1 3.8% per hour prior to injury to 21.7 \u00b1 1.6% per hour after injury: <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Surprisingly, in the first two hours after injury, there was also a modest increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis (control: 6.6 \u00b1 3.7% per hour vs. post-axotomy: 14.0 \u00b1 6.9% per hour; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a, c</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). This is likely due to the activation of NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme in the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic pathway, which is negatively regulated by NAD<sup>+</sup>. The decline in NAD<sup>+</sup> relieves this feedback inhibition and results in increased NAMPT activity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Elliott and Rechsteiner, 1982</a>), which is also the likely explanation for the transient increase in axonal NMN after injury (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Although the NAD<sup>+</sup>\u00a0synthesis rate was increased during the first two hours after axotomy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>), total NAD<sup>+</sup> declined due to the larger increase in the NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption rate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). After two hours post-axotomy, heavy NAD<sup>+</sup> declined at the same rate as light NAD<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>), indicating a complete loss of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis, likely due to loss of the labile NMNAT2 in the severed axon (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gilley et al., 2010</a>). Hence, flux analysis demonstrates that injury-induced NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion is due to a major increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption that begins shortly after the\u00a0axon damage and before the loss of axonal NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). This surprising finding highlights the utility of flux analysis to provide mechanistic insights that were not appreciated in prior studies of steady-state NAD<sup>+</sup> levels."

To test this hypothesis, we applied NAD<sup>+</sup> flux analysis to SARM1-deficient neurons. The NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption rate in SARM1-deficient axons was comparable to control axons prior to injury (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>). However in contrast to the dramatic increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption in wildtype neurons after injury, there was no significant change in NAD<sup>+\u00a0</sup>consumption rate after injury in SARM1 mutant axons (uninjured: 6.3 \u00b1 2.4% per hour vs. SARM1 mutant: 7.9 \u00b1 3.7% per hour after axotomy). Hence, SARM1 is required for the injury-induced increase in NAD<sup>+\u00a0</sup>consumption (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,b</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This supports and extends our previous finding that SARM1 is responsible for initiating events that lead to the depletion of axonal NAD<sup>+</sup> following axotomy (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gerdts et al., 2015</a>)."

The overexpression of NAMPT, which leads to modest axon protection, did not block injury-induced SARM1-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption. In contrast, expression of either cytNMNAT1 or NMN deamidase completely eliminated SARM1-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption after axotomy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). This is a striking result that likely explains the profound axoprotective effects of overexpressing either NMNAT or NMN deamidase \u2014both block the ability of SARM1 to trigger NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation following axotomy. Loss of SARM1 or gain of NMNAT or NMN deamidase all lead to profound and long-lasting axonal protection following injury, and all three block NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation following injury. In contrast, treatments that provide modest axon protection (e.g. NAMPT) likely do so by transiently countering injury-induced NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation through their ability to elevate intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> and thus maintain axonal NAD<sup>+</sup> levels above a critical threshold for a longer period after injury."

Here we identify two distinct mechanisms that block axon degeneration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The most potent protection comes from overexpression of cytNMNAT1 or NMN deamidase, both of which block SARM1-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in the injured axon. By inference, NMNAT2 also works via this mechanism, thus when its levels decline in the injured axon, SARM1 becomes activated. This biochemical demonstration that NMNAT enzymes inhibit SARM1 activation is consistent with a recent study showing that the embryonic lethality of NMNAT2 knockout mice is rescued by the loss of SARM1. This provides strong genetic evidence that NMNAT2 functions upstream of SARM1 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gilley et al, 2015</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Weaker axonal protection is provided by overexpression of NAMPT or by treating neurons expressing NRK1 with NR. These latter manipulations do not block SARM1-dependent NAD<sup>+\u00a0</sup>consumption, but do lead to a large increase in steady-state NAD<sup>+</sup> levels prior to axotomy that likely maintains NAD<sup>+</sup> above a critical threshold for an extended period of time after SARM1 activation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). As in other studies (<a href=\"#bib21\">Sasaki et al., 2009b</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">Di Stefano et al., 2015</a>), we also observed that FK866, a NAMPT inhibitor, delays axon degeneration. We do not have an adequate explanation for this phenomenon; however, it should be noted that FK866 provides much weaker protection than that afforded by NAMPT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>)."

How then do NMNAT enzymes (and NMN deamidase) block SARM1-stimulated axon degeneration and NAD<sup>+</sup> loss? One possibility is that these enzymes physically interact with SARM1 to inhibit its ability to activate axon degeneration pathways including those involved in NAD<sup>+</sup> loss. However, NMNAT enzymes from many species, including the archean <i>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</i>, provide dramatic axonal protection despite their minimal amino acid sequence similarity, thus making direct interaction with SARM1 an unlikely mechanism (<a href=\"#bib21\">Sasaki et al., 2009b</a>). Second, the necessity for increased NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in a specific axonal compartment is an attractive explanation, however there is no evidence for this mechanism. Protein transduction experiments with cytNMNAT1 show rapid and strong axon protection, and it seems unlikely that a mutant nuclear protein would end up in a specific axonal compartment necessary to promote axon protection (<a href=\"#bib20\">Sasaki et al., 2009a</a>). Finally, mutations in both NMNAT enzymes and NMN deamidase that destroy their enzymatic activity also block their axon protective capabilities (<a href=\"#bib1\">Araki et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">Sasaki et al., 2009b</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">Di Stefano et al., 2015</a>). This strongly suggests that metabolites whose levels are altered by NMNAT and/or NMN deamidase activity regulate SARM1 function. NMN was such a candidate metabolite because it is a substrate for both NMNAT enzymes and NMN deamidase; however, our studies show that NMN levels do not regulate NAD<sup>+</sup> loss and axon degeneration, both SARM1-induced activities. Further investigations to identify other cellular metabolites modulated by NMNAT or NMN deamidase may help elucidate the mechanism of SARM1 regulation and axonal degeneration."

For heavy-labeled NAD<sup>+</sup>, D3-NAD<sup>+</sup> as well as D4-NAD<sup>+</sup> was observed as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hara et al., 2014</a>). This is due to the replacement of deuterium at C4 position with non-labeled proton during NAD<sup>+</sup>d this combined value-NADH cycling. We added the values of D3-NAD<sup>+</sup> and D4-NAD<sup>+</sup>and used this combined value as the amount of newly synthesized NAD<sup>+</sup>.

Using this assay, the authors find that axotomy triggers a surge of NAD+ consumption that requires the SARM TIR-containing adapter protein and is blocked by expression of the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT1."

Given that this is an unexpected result, it should be discussed a bit more. How might this work?

Through multiple manipulations and new NAD+ flux analysis they come to two main conclusions: 1. Increase in NMN upon injury is not the trigger and is not essential for axonal degeneration. This is in contrast to a recent published study (Di Stefano. et al., 2015). 2. Axonal protection by NMNAT1 is generated by inhibition of the SARM dependent NAD+ degradation/consumption and not through counter synthesis of NAD+. The second conclusion is very interesting and in many aspects contradicts the assumption that NMNAT1 or Wlds protect against axonal degeneration by supplement of NAD+ purely through synthesis. It also suggests that targeting of the SARM dependent NAD+ degradation pathway may be more effective than stimulation of NAMPT activity."

They have developed NAD flux analyses here by loading cultures with D4-NAM. On the one hand, this seems like quite a technical advance for a metabolomics approach applied to isolated axons that has been lacking in the field. Similarly, showing that elevated NMN levels do not correlate with axon degeneration is an advance that overturns some reports in the literature. The manuscript is also overall well written and the central conclusion that NMNAT1 blocks SARM mediated NAD depletion is quite intriguing, so the findings appear to be relatively novel and could advance the field. However, the authors provide no clear insight into the mechanism of how NMNAT1 blocks SARM function other than its known role in generating NAD. From a mechanistic point of view it is puzzling that this occurs without affecting steady state NAD levels. It is not clear to me from the data how NMNAT1 or NMN deamidase could do this without altering NAD production. Do these proteins interact with SARM1 or directly inhibit its function? At the very least, I think that the authors could add some speculation to the Discussion paragraph(s), though data would make a more compelling case."

Given that this is an unexpected result, it should be discussed a bit more. How might this work? Are there distinct pools of NAD+ in axons that can only be accessed by a subset of the manipulations employed by the authors? Are some enzymes able to interact with the SARM pathway and others not?

Because NAD<sup>+</sup> is at steady state in uninjured axons, this consumption rate is equivalent to the synthesis rate and so we do not present both values. These results show that the baseline NAD<sup>+</sup> flux is not correlated with axonal protection, but rather with the level of NAD<sup>+</sup>. These results are expected since the NMN deamidase inhibits NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis by reducing the levels of NMN and NAMPT promotes NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis by increasing the levels of NMN. NMN is the rate limiting metabolite in the NAD biosynthetic pathway. Wild type, SARM KO, and NMNAT1 have normal levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> and normal NAD<sup>+</sup> flux at baseline."

Finally, the reviewer asks how long the axons were cut in panels 4B and 4C. We calculated the NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption rate (4B) at four hours after cut. We calculated the synthesis rate (4C) at two hours after cut. We used a shorter time for the synthesis rate because after two hours NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis essentially stops (as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, and likely due to the previously described loss of Nmnat2 by about two hours after injury).

They have developed NAD flux analyses here by loading cultures with D4-NAM. On the one hand, this seems like quite a technical advance for a metabolomics approach applied to isolated axons that has been lacking in the field. Similarly, showing that elevated NMN levels do not correlate with axon degeneration is an advance that overturns some reports in the literature. The manuscript is also overall well written and the central conclusion that NMNAT1 blocks SARM mediated NAD depletion is quite intriguing, so the findings appear to be relatively novel and could advance the field. However, the authors provide no clear insight into the mechanism of how NMNAT1 blocks SARM function other than its known role in generating NAD. From a mechanistic point of view it is puzzling that this occurs without affecting steady state NAD levels. It is not clear to me from the data how NMNAT1 or NMN deamidase could do this without altering NAD production. Do these proteins interact with SARM1 or directly inhibit its function? At the very least, I think that the authors could add some speculation to the Discussion paragraph(s), though data would make a more compelling case.</i> "
