Surprisingly, despite the diversity of these features, we have found that deleting <i>Mecp2</i> only from GABAergic inhibitory neurons in mice replicates most of this phenotype. Here we show that genetically restoring <i>Mecp2</i> expression only in GABAergic neurons of male <i>Mecp2</i> null mice enhanced inhibitory signaling, extended lifespan, and rescued ataxia, apraxia, and social abnormalities but did not rescue tremor or anxiety. Female <i>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice showed a less dramatic but still substantial rescue. These findings highlight the critical regulatory role of GABAergic neurons in certain behaviors and suggest that modulating the excitatory/inhibitory balance through GABAergic neurons could prove a viable therapeutic option in Rett syndrome."
