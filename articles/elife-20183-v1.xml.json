                    "text": "Prostate cancer is driven by androgen stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR). The next-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, prolongs survival, but resistance and lethal disease eventually prevail. Emerging data suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is upregulated in this context, stimulating expression of AR-target genes that permit continued growth despite AR blockade. However, countering this mechanism by administration of GR antagonists is problematic because GR is essential for life. We show that enzalutamide treatment in human models of prostate cancer and patient tissues is accompanied by a ubiquitin E3-ligase, AMFR, mediating loss of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11\u03b2-HSD2), which otherwise inactivates cortisol, sustaining tumor cortisol concentrations to stimulate GR and enzalutamide resistance. Remarkably, reinstatement of 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression, or AMFR loss, reverses enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft tumors. Together, these findings reveal a surprising metabolic mechanism of enzalutamide resistance that may be targeted with a strategy that circumvents a requirement for systemic GR ablation."

The next-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, prolongs survival, but resistance and lethal disease eventually prevail. Emerging data suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is upregulated in this context, stimulating expression of AR-target genes that permit continued growth despite AR blockade. However, countering this mechanism by administration of GR antagonists is problematic because GR is essential for life. We show that enzalutamide treatment in human models of prostate cancer and patient tissues is accompanied by a ubiquitin E3-ligase, AMFR, mediating loss of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11\u03b2-HSD2), which otherwise inactivates cortisol, sustaining tumor cortisol concentrations to stimulate GR and enzalutamide resistance. Remarkably, reinstatement of 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression, or AMFR loss, reverses enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft tumors. Together, these findings reveal a surprising metabolic mechanism of enzalutamide resistance that may be targeted with a strategy that circumvents a requirement for systemic GR ablation."

Enzalutamide is a potent next-generation AR antagonist and prolongs survival for patients with metastatic CRPC (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Scher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Tran et al., 2009</a>).

A challenge has been reconciling these findings with the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids in CRPC (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kach et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Montgomery et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Sartor et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, targeting such a mechanism with GR antagonists may be problematic because total and systemic GR blockade is incompatible with life (<a href=\"#bib27\">Sharifi, 2014</a>). Treatment directed at a tumor-specific mechanism that regulates GR would therefore be desirable. We hypothesized that similar to metabolic mechanisms that elicit DHT synthesis, which in turn stimulate AR in CRPC (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Knudsen and Penning, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Sharifi, 2013</a>), a role for GR in enzalutamide resistance would be accompanied by a tumor metabolic switch that provides sustained tissue cortisol concentrations that enable GR activation. Such a scenario and mechanism may furnish a tumor-specific pharmacologic target and thereby avoid adverse effects associated with systemic GR ablation."

For example, fetal and placental 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression shields against maternal cortisol, thereby restricting GR stimulation and blocking premature fetal maturation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chapman et al., 2013</a>). Here, we show that enzalutamide resistance is marked by sustained cortisol concentrations in the prostate tumor that are attributable to a profound loss of 11\u03b2-HSD2 and impaired conversion to cortisone, which together de-repress GR and stimulate glucocorticoid-dependent signaling. Mechanistically, 11\u03b2-HSD2 loss is mediated by the ubiquitin E3-ligase autocrine mobility factor receptor (AMFR). Finally, sustained 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression reverses the metabolic phenotype of enzalutamide resistance and reinstates the therapeutic response to enzalutamide in vivo."

LAPC4 cells stably harboring a construct conferring forced 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression or vector alone (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) were injected subcutaneously and xenograft tumors were grown in surgically orchiectomized mice that were also implanted with sustained-release DHEA pellets to mimic the human adrenal androgen milieu in CRPC. When tumors reached 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice in each group were randomized to enzalutamide in chow or chow alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). Tumors appeared to harbor significant resistance to treatment with enzalutamide, as evidenced by the\u00a0growth of Vector xenografts through enzalutamide therapy. Forced 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression significantly reversed enzalutamide-resistant growth and prolonged progression-free survival. In contrast, 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression had no significant effect on untreated tumors, supporting a model in which the effect of 11\u03b2-HSD2 on tumor growth is specific to the context of resistance to potent AR antagonist therapy. Reinstatement of sensitivity to enzalutamide treatment also occurred in a second (VCaP) xenograft model of CRPC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D</a>). In contrast to humans, the mouse adrenal does not express 17\u03b1-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase and thus synthesizes corticosterone instead of cortisol as the dominant glucocorticoid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which is similarly inactivated to 11-dehydrocorticosterone by 11\u03b2-HSD2 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Miller and Auchus, 2011</a>). To validate if reversal of enzalutamide resistance with forced 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression is accompanied by the proposed intratumoral biochemical effect of depleting biologically active tumor glucocorticoids, we assessed corticosterone concentrations in enzalutamide-treated xenograft tissues by mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). 11\u03b2-HSD2 reinstatement depleted corticosterone concentrations by approximately two-thirds in enzalutamide-treated tumors (44.5 pmol/g in vector tumors vs. 15.1 pmol/g in 11\u03b2-HSD2 tumors; p=0.002), which otherwise harbor the capacity to metabolically sustain elevated concentrations of biologically active glucocorticoids. Tumor 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression also results in a significant decline in the percentage of tumor corticosterone (59% in vector tumors vs. 33% in 11\u03b2-HSD2 tumors; p&lt;0.0001) when compared to the sum total of corticosterone plus 11-dehydrocorticosterone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). In contrast to the effects of 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression on tumor glucocorticoids in enzalutamide treated mice, there is no significant change in serum in the absolute concentration (873 pmol/ml in vector mice vs. 867 pmol/ml in 11\u03b2-HSD2 mice; p=0.49; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>) or percentage of corticosterone (99.87% in vector mice vs. 99.85% in 11\u03b2-HSD2 mice; p&lt;0.93; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>)."

                                "text": "We previously described the role of AMFR, a ubiquitin E3-ligase in the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway, in regulation of another steroidogenic enzyme, 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 2013</a>). As 11\u03b2-HSD2 is also located in the endoplasmic reticulum, we hypothesized that AMFR is required for enzalutamide-induced loss of 11\u03b2-HSD2 protein. A physical association between 11\u03b2-HSD2 and AMFR is supported by immunoprecipitation of AMFR, followed by immunoblot for 11\u03b2-HSD2, as well as immunoprecipitation of 11\u03b2-HSD2, followed by immunoblot for AMFR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Expression of 11\u03b2-HSD2, Ubiquitin-His, and AMFR-Myc-DDK, followed by Ni-agarose pull-down and anti-11\u03b2-HSD2 immunoblot demonstrates the AMFR-dependence of 11\u03b2-HSD2 ubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Enzalutamide treatment did not consistently increase AMFR expression (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). However, Erlin-2, which enables the AMFR-associated endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway (ERAD), was more consistently up-regulated, including in 8 of 11 patient tissues (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Browman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Pearce et al., 2007</a>). The functional consequence of 11\u03b2-HSD2 / AMFR interaction and 11\u03b2-HSD2 ubiquitination is evidenced by genetically silencing AMFR with stable shRNA expression, which promotes an increase in 11\u03b2-HSD2 protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) but not transcript (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Furthermore, the enzalutamide-induced metabolic phenotype that sustains cortisol concentrations by way of retarded inactivation is reversed with genetic ablation of AMFR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Silencing both 11\u03b2-HSD2 and AMFR with enzalutamide treatment negates the effect of genetically silencing AMFR alone, suggesting that the effect of AMFR is mediated through 11\u03b2-HSD2 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Finally, the functional relevance and requirement for AMFR expression on enzalutamide resistance is suggested by suppressed xenograft growth and prolonged progression-free survival in enzalutamide-treated xenografts with stable AMFR knockdown (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>). Tumors with AMFR knockdown were confirmed to have sustained 11\u03b2-HSD2 protein expression, thus impairing enzalutamide resistance (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Together, these findings suggest a model in which a physical association between AMFR and 11\u03b2-HSD2 enables enzalutamide to promote loss of 11\u03b2-HSD2, resulting in sustained cortisol concentrations that promote GR stimulation."

(<b>E</b>) AMFR is required for tumor growth through enzalutamide therapy. Xenografts from LAPC4 cells expressing shAMFR or non-silencing control vector (shCtrl) were grown in surgically orchiectomized mice supplemented with DHEA and treated with Enz when tumors reached 100 mm<sup>3</sup>. The significance of the difference between shCtrl and shAMFR groups was calculated with an unpaired and two-tailed t-test on day 20.

These findings indicate that systemic availability of GR agonists represents only one aspect of tumor GR stimulation in the setting of enzalutamide resistance. Local metabolic regulation of ligand availability by the tumor serves as a second critical aspect and can either oppose the effects of systemic glucocorticoids by spurring enzymatic inactivation, or instead allow unimpeded access to the tumor tissue, enabling sustained GR stimulation to promote tumor progression."

Although the therapeutic effect of glucocorticoids is likely due in part to adrenal androgen suppression, the complete effects of glucocorticoids in prostate cancer have yet to be fully elucidated (<a href=\"#bib3\">Attard et al., 2012</a>). Our observations move us closer to an understanding of the role of glucocorticoid pharmacology and physiology in prostate cancer. It has been recently recognized that GR stimulation may also contribute to prostate cancer progression. Our findings suggest yet another consideration that adds to the complexity of glucocorticoid signaling in prostate cancer, namely susceptibility of the administered glucocorticoid to metabolic inactivation, that is likely relevant to the increased GR expression that may occur alongside enzalutamide resistance and allows direct tumor-promoting effects of glucocorticoids in CRPC. For example, prednisolone is inactivated by 11\u03b2-HSD2 to prednisone but dexamethasone is generally thought to be impervious to inactivation by 11\u03b2-HSD2. This may be even more important prior to enzalutamide therapy and consequent suppression of 11\u03b2-HSD2 loss, because some data suggest that baseline GR expression prior to enzalutamide treatment, where 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression is intact, may be associated with enzalutamide resistance (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arora et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, early results from a neoadjuvant clinical trial of castration plus abiraterone suggest that tissue cortisol may be elevated specifically in prostate cancers that up-regulate GR (<a href=\"#bib9\">Efstathiou et al., 2015</a>). Thus, it is possible that altered tumor glucocorticoid metabolism by way of the mechanism we have elucidated occurs not only with enzalutamide but also with abiraterone therapy."

Our data raise the possibility that blocking 11\u03b2-HSD2 protein loss, for example by blocking AMFR, or reinstatement of 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression in the tumor may be an appropriate strategy to reverse enzalutamide resistance without affecting the\u00a0systemic availability of glucocorticoids and resultant associated toxicities. Blocking AMFR may also increase 3\u03b2HSD1 protein, sustaining androgen synthesis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 2013</a>). However, our in vivo studies with AMFR knockdown suggest that in the context of enzalutamide treatment, the net effect of AMFR ablation is therapeutic, probably because the AR ligand binding domain remains mainly occupied by enzalutamide and glucocorticoid signaling is a major driver of tumor progression."

This is an important question because up-regulation of GR and subsequent cortisol-mediated expression of a large number of androgen receptor responsive genes is believed to contribute to enzalutamide resistance. A key question is how to block cortisol's action locally, in the tumor, because systemic blockade of GR function is likely to be intolerably toxic. Here the authors show that enzalutamide causes a delay of cortisol conversion to cortisone in CPRC cell lines and xenografts. This is associated with increased GR expression and decreased expression of 11\u03b2-HSD2, a cortisol-metabolizing enzyme, in cells, primary tumor tissue and tumors treated ex vivo with enzalutamide. Enforced 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression is sufficient to decrease residual cortisol levels and decrease expression of cortisol-responsive genes in cell lines. It also reduces cortisosterone levels in xenografts and enhances the therapeutic effect of enzalutamide. Mechanistically, 11\u03b2-HSD2 physically interacts with AMFR, an ER-associated E3-ubiquitin ligase, and eliminating AMFR expression enhances 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression, increases conversion of cortisol to cortisone, and enhances the effect of enzalutamide on tumor growth. Overall, the authors provide evidence for a new concept in counteracting enzalutamide resistance by reducing local GR signaling in CRPC tumors."
