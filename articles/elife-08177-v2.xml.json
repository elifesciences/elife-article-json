Mammals, on the other hand, have evolved to hear a much wider range of sounds from loud and low frequency sounds, such as thunder, to soft and high frequency sounds, like the cries of their young. In mammals, the part of inner ear involved in hearing (called the cochlea) has an elaborate spiral-like shape. The structure of the cochlea results in different frequencies of sound being transformed by the hair cells into electrical signals at different points around the spiral. Because of this, most researchers didn\u2019t think that hair cells in mammals were individually tuned like those in bullfrogs."

In conditions that mimic the environment inside the ear, a very precise jet of fluid was used to stimulate single hair cells in a similar way to a sound wave. The experiments then compared how hair cells from the upper and lower parts of the cochlea\u2019s spiral responded. Johnson found that hair cells from the upper portion of the gerbils\u2019 cochlea are specialized to capture low frequency sounds. They have electrical properties that allow them to quickly transmit information to the brain about low frequency sounds. In the lower portion of the cochlea, hair cells are specialized to capture high frequency sounds. That is, their electrical properties make it easier for these hair cells to transmit detailed information to the brain about the volume of high frequency sounds. Together, these findings help explain how these animals are able to localize sounds, which requires capturing both the timing and intensity of different types of sounds."

The sensory receptors of the auditory system, the hair cells, are responsible for the transduction of sound waves into electrical signals that travel along the auditory pathway. The mechanosensory apparatus of hair cells is the stereociliary hair bundle that protrudes from their apical surface in the form of a staircase-like structure (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schwander et al., 2010</a>). Mechano-sensitive ion channels are positioned near the tip of the shorter rows of stereocilia (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beurg et al., 2009</a>), the opening of which initiates a receptor potential that is shaped by voltage and ion-gated ion channels in the hair cell\u2019s basolateral membrane. The receptor potential activates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the basal pole of the cell that trigger the release of neurotransmitter onto afferent terminals (<a href=\"#bib24\">Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002</a>), so that sound information is conveyed to the higher auditory brain areas."

In these animals, the interplay between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels, which are differentially expressed along the auditory organ, are thought to be the main mechanism determining hair cell frequency selectivity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hudspeth and Lewis 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wu et al., 1995</a>). The mammalian auditory system has evolved to be able to encode a much wider dynamic range of sound frequencies and intensities. In order to do this, mammals have developed an elaborate auditory organ where much of the frequency tuning is carried out by the mechanics of the basilar membrane (<a href=\"#bib51\">Robles and Ruggero, 2001</a>) and electromotility of the outer hair cells (OHCs) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brownell et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ashmore, 1987</a>) driven by the motor protein prestin (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liberman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dallos et al., 2006</a>). These morphological and functional differences along the mammalian cochlea produce a tonotopic place-frequency map that is preserved throughout the\u00a0auditory pathway. Thus the main sensory receptors, the inner hair cells (IHCs), are believed not to show intrinsic tuning in mammals (<a href=\"#bib39\">Marcotti et al., 2003</a>), although recent studies have shown tonotopic differences in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<a href=\"#bib33\">Johnson and Marcotti, 2008</a>), the size of Ca<sup>2+</sup> hotspots at ribbon synapses (<a href=\"#bib43\">Meyer et al., 2009</a>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johnson et al., 2008</a>) along the cochlea. Moreover, the in vivo receptor potentials of low and high-frequency mammalian IHCs differ because of the relative filtering properties of the cells\u2019 basolateral membrane. Low-frequency IHCs (up to a few kilohertz) have a predominantly phasic (AC) component that follows the stimulation frequency and is graded in size to the intensity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dallos, 1985</a>). The receptor potentials of high-frequency cells cannot follow the sound stimulus and as such do not have a large phasic component. Instead, they have a predominantly sustained (DC) component that is the average depolarization resulting when there is an asymmetric transduction current and it oscillates too fast for the cell membrane potential to keep up. The DC component is graded in size to sound intensity (<a href=\"#bib52\">Russell and Sellick, 1978</a>)."

The results show that the size of the resting mechanotransducer (MT) current and the composition of basolateral membrane currents are optimized to confer low- and high-frequency IHCs with different resting membrane potentials (<i>V</i><sub>m</sub>) and kinetics\u00a0in vivo. These biophysical differences allow apical IHCs to follow precisely the phasic component of sound, while basal cells are able to accurately encode the sustained and graded component of high-frequency stimuli, providing direct evidence for the existence of intrinsic filtering in mammalian cochlear IHCs."

                                "text": "MT currents from apical (~300\u2009Hz) and basal (~30 kHz) coil IHCs of the mature gerbil (P17\u2013P25) were elicited by displacing their hair bundles along their axis of mechanosensitivity with a 50\u2009Hz sinusoidal stimulus using a piezoelectric fluid jet stimulator. The fluid jet produces a uniform deflection of the hair bundle (<a href=\"#bib14\">Corns et al., 2014</a>) and for IHCs, which are stimulated in vivo\u00a0by fluid motion within the cochlear partition (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fettiplace and Kim, 2014</a>), it provides a near-physiological stimulation without affecting their resting position. To mimic in vivo conditions as closely as possible, recordings were obtained from IHCs maintained at body temperature and their hair bundles were perfused with an extracellular solution containing an endolymphatic low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (40 \u00b5M: see Materials\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The same low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution was also used inside the fluid jet. A large inward MT current was elicited in both apical (1.1 \u00b1 0.1 nA, n = 5, P20\u2013P25: <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and basal coil IHCs (1.0 \u00b1 0.2 nA, n = 6, P17\u2013P25: <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) upon moving their bundle in the excitatory direction (i.e., towards the taller stereocilia using positive driver voltages). Apical cells had a significantly larger resting MT current (464 \u00b1 29 pA: <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <i>P<i>&lt;</i></i>0.0001), which shut off during inhibitory phases of the stimulus, than that recorded from basal cells (70 \u00b1 17 pA: <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This difference was also observed with FM1-43, a styryl dye that permeates the open transducer channels and accumulates inside the hair cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gale et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Furness et al., 2013</a>). Bath application of FM1-43 onto P18\u2013P22 gerbil cochleae (n = 6) labeled IHCs strongly in the apical coil but only weakly in the base (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a>, respectively). The opposite was observed in the OHCs, consistent with the fact they have larger resting MT currents in the basal region (<a href=\"#bib30\">Johnson et al., 2011</a>)."

Current clamp recordings were performed on mature apical and basal coil gerbil IHCs (P17\u2013P22) in response to current injection steps of up to 1 nA from their resting potential (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). In the presence of 1.3 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is normally used when studying basolateral membrane currents, the resting potentials of apical (\u201368.6 \u00b1 1.3 mV, n = 12) and basal (\u201371.7 \u00b1 0.6 mV, n = 11) IHCs were very similar (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and D</a>), and within the same range previously found in mature IHCs from mice (<a href=\"#bib40\">Marcotti et al., 2004</a>). The low (40 \u00b5M) extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution caused apical IHCs to depolarize (\u201356.1 \u00b1 1.5 mV, n = 12) significantly more than basal IHCs (<i>P</i>&lt;0.0001; \u201365.8 \u00b1 1.3 mV, n = 11; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and D</a>). The voltage responses of apical IHCs showed an initial decline and compression for the larger depolarizing current steps, whereas basal were larger, more sustained, and graded to the stimulus, especially in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and E</a>). In the presence of the MT channel blocker dihydrostreptomycin (DHS) (100 \u00b5M) the voltage responses returned to control levels (40 \u00b5M Ca<sup>2+</sup> + DHS: <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and D</a>), indicating that the shift in the resting membrane potential in low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> was due to the increased MT channel open probability. These findings demonstrate that the resting membrane potential of apical IHCs is likely to be substantially more depolarized than that of basal cells in vivo, which would speed up their membrane time constant. The time constant of the voltage rise, following 100 pA depolarizing current injections, were significantly more rapid in apical than in basal IHCs in both control 1.3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001; apical: 1.03 \u00b1 0.11 ms, n = 12; basal: 1.89 \u00b1 0.19 ms, n = 11) and low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (<i>P</i>&lt;0.0005; apical: 0.44 \u00b1 0.08 ms, n = 12; basal: 1.07 \u00b1 0.13 ms, n = 11) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). The different voltage responses between apical and basal IHCs indicates the existence of cellular specializations in the underlying basolateral membrane currents."

Both apical (n = 26) and basal IHCs (n = 27) showed the currents characteristic of mature IHCs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Marcotti et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kros et al., 1998</a>), namely, the rapidly activating large conductance (BK), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> current (<i>I</i><sub>K,f</sub>), and the negatively activating delayed rectifier current (<i>I</i><sub>K,n</sub>: carried by KCNQ4 channels;\u00a0\u00a0potassium\u00a0\u00a0channel,\u00a0\u00a0voltage\u00a0\u00a0gated\u00a0\u00a0KQT-like\u00a0\u00a0subfamily\u00a0\u00a0Q,\u00a0\u00a0member\u00a0\u00a04). The overall size of the peak and steady-state inward and outward currents appeared comparable between apical and basal IHCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The peak current measured at 2 ms gives a reliable and accurate measurement of the size of <i>I</i><sub>K,f</sub> in isolation due to its very rapid activation kinetics (<a href=\"#bib40\">Marcotti et al., 2004</a>), which was similar between apical and basal gerbil IHCs. The overall slope conductance, measured at around the likely in vivo membrane potential (Ac: \u201354 mV; Bc: \u201364 mV: <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) from the steady-state current-voltage (I-V) curves, was found to be significantly larger in apical (56.3 \u00b1 3.0 nS, n = 26, <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001) than in basal IHCs (10.0 \u00b1 0.4 nS, n = 27). Profound differences were observed in the current\u00a0\u00a0activation time-course and size of the tail currents between apical and basal IHCs (apical: <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D, F, and H</a>; basal: <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E, G, and H</a>). All IHCs investigated showed a very negative current activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>, inset). Pharmacological analysis revealed a differential expression of K<sup>+</sup> currents between apical and basal IHCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013E</a>). The main difference between the cells was the outward delayed-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current that was mainly a linopirdine-insensitive <i>I</i><sub>K,s</sub> in basal IHCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) while in apical cells it was predominantly a linopirdine-sensitive current (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) reminiscent of the outward <i>I</i><sub>K,n</sub> found in adult OHCs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Marcotti and Kros, 1999</a>). The deactivating tail currents of the linopirdine-sensitive current (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) indicate that there is more than one linopirdine-sensitive current component. The negatively activating component is larger in basal cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>) and is similar in size and voltage-dependence to the <i>I</i><sub>K,n</sub> previously shown in apical-coil mouse IHCs that are also comparatively high-frequency receptors (<a href=\"#bib39\">Marcotti et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Oliver et al., 2003</a>). The tonotopic difference in this negatively activating <i>I</i><sub>K,n</sub> is consistent with the expression gradient of KCNQ4 channels observed in the rat (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beisel et al., 2005</a>). The more positively activating linopirdine-sensitive component was much larger in apical IHCs and could result from the expression of a different KCNQ channel subtype."

However, recent electrophysiological observations have indicated that the buffering strength in gerbil IHCs along the cochlea is likely to be similar (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johnson et al., 2008</a>). In order to verify this observation, I performed recordings from mature gerbil IHCs (P29\u2013P36) under the perforated patch configuration, a condition that prevents the dialysis of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer in the pipette solution and therefore preserves any tonotopic gradient that could be present. The basolateral currents recorded using perforated patch (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>) were similar to those obtained with whole cell recording (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). The overall current size was similar between apical and basal IHCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), but the tail currents were much larger in apical cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>) as shown\u00a0\u00a0in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. The size of the resting transducer current, which contributes to the cells holding current in voltage clamp, was measured by perfusing IHCs with low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> extracellular solution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D and E</a>). The addition of DHS to the low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution largely prevented the increase in holding current magnitude, indicating that the transducer channel component was absent. The change in holding current in perforated patch (apical IHCs \u2013764 \u00b1 28 pA, n = 3; basal IHCs \u201399 \u00b1 21 pA, n = 4) was similar to that obtained with whole cell recordings (apical IHCs \u2013549 \u00b1 81 pA, n = 6; basal IHCs \u201369 \u00b1 22 pA, n = 4) and also similar to the resting transducer current values obtained from direct MT current measurements in low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>)."

However, the more depolarized V<sub>m</sub> of apical IHCs, and the consequently larger resting membrane conductance, made positively going responses to stimulation generally smaller than in basal cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a>). The hyperpolarizing phase of apical IHCs was more pronounced than in basal cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). For larger stimuli, at frequencies approaching (2 kHz) or exceeding (10 kHz) the maximum limit for phase locking in vivo (<a href=\"#bib49\">Palmer and Russell, 1986</a>), the first phase of the responses in apical IHCs reached its maximum value immediately after the onset of stimulation. By contrast, the responses of basal cells built up to reach a peak after a few cycles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) because they are superimposed on a rising DC response that grows with timing set by the membrane time constant. While apical IHCs appear to be suited for phasic signaling, basal cells are more adept at signaling graded responses to high-frequency stimuli (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E and F</a>) since their receptor potential builds up to represent stimulus intensity."

The time differences are also shown as phase angle shifts, calculated based on the size of the time difference and the stimulus frequency. At 300\u2009Hz the timing was generally more advanced in apical IHCs for the lower stimulus levels (100 pA: closed symbols in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The same also occurred at 1 nA for the first peak, after which positive peaks in basal IHCs occurred sooner (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), but this made the half-cycle width much less accurate\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0\u00a0basal\u00a0\u00a0cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). At 300\u2009Hz the half-cycle error was generally lower at each stimulus level in apical IHCs. At 2 kHz, where the timing and accuracy of the phasic component would be vital in vivo, the peak responses of apical IHCs again occurred generally more rapidly than in basal cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). In contrast to 300\u2009Hz the timing difference at 2 kHz declined with progressive peaks to a stable level, but remained with an apical advance. This stable apical lead seems to be due to the underlying basolateral current differences between the two cell types (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3\u20135</a>), because when apical and basal cells were stimulated with the same apical-like 2 kHz 1 nA protocol a similar stable apical lead was evident (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013C</a>). Additionally, when the outward linopirdine-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> current, present only in apical cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), was blocked, the voltage responses became more basal-like (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013F</a>). The 2 kHz responses of apical cells were very accurate at each stimulus level (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>), whereas basal cells began with a large half-cycle error that improved progressively, as seen for the timing differences. The decline in basal cell half-cycle error is likely to reflect the decrease in cell membrane time constant, to a fairly steady value, as depolarization activates the K<sup>+</sup> currents. Therefore, the intrinsic characteristics of apical IHCs seem to be\u00a0\u00a0best suited for the accurate representation of the phasic component of the receptor potential."

Using physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and body temperature, low-frequency (apical) IHCs had a significantly larger resting MT current than high-frequency (basal) cells. A large difference in the resting MT current was observed using three independent methods: direct MT current recordings, FM1-43 labeling, and shifts in the holding current in whole cell and perforated patch clamp. The physiological consequence of differences in the resting MT current is that the IHC resting membrane potential in vivo, in the absence of sound stimulation, is likely to be around \u201355 mV in apical and \u201365 mV in basal cells. This, combined with their different complement of basolateral membrane currents (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3\u20135</a>), indicates that low- frequency and high-frequency IHCs are intrinsically specialized to their location. The gerbil was the preferred model for this study because of its extended low-frequency hearing range (0.1\u201360 kHz: <a href=\"#bib44\">M\u00fcller, 1996</a>) where phase-locking to auditory stimuli occurs (<a href=\"#bib56\">Versteegh et al., 2011</a>), compared to the predominantly high-frequency hearing of the mouse (2\u2013100 kHz: <a href=\"#bib27\">Greenwood, 1990</a>)."

While low-frequency cells have a predominant sound frequency-following, or phase-locked, AC component (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dallos, 1985</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cheatham and Dallos, 1993</a>), the main component of high-frequency cells is a graded and sustained DC shift in potential in proportion to sound intensity (<a href=\"#bib52\">Russell and Sellick, 1978</a>). Mammals use two main strategies to localize sounds of different frequency. Low frequencies are localized by principal cells in the medial superior olive (MSO) that compare the inter-aural timing differences (ITDs) of phase-locked activity in auditory afferents from the two ears (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chirila et al., 2007</a>). High-frequency sounds are localized by principal cells in the lateral superior olive (LSO) that compares inter-aural level differences (ILDs) arising from the graded responses of IHCs of each ear (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caird and Klinke, 1983</a>). Therefore, the biophysical properties of low-frequency and high-frequency IHCs should be best suited to maximize the accuracy of response-timing in apical cells and response-level in basal cells to allow the detection of ITDs down to 10 \u00b5s and ILDs of only 1\u20132 dB (<a href=\"#bib28\">Grothe et al., 2010</a>). In the present study I found that low-frequency IHCs have a significantly more depolarized resting <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> than basal cells arising from the large resting MT current, which increases their resting conductance and speeds up their voltage responses. In response to simulated sound stimuli, apical IHCs were faster and preserved the phase width of the stimulus better than basal cells up to around the maximum frequency for phase-locking. However, the superior speed and timing of apical cells is not just down to their more depolarized <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> since basal cells remained slower even when depolarized at similar values to those of apical cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013C</a>). I found that the differential expression of the K<sup>+</sup> current <i>I</i><sub>K,n</sub> in apical and basal IHCs was a major determinant for response speed and timing at low frequencies (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013F</a>)."

This is comparable to the visual system where photons of light cause a hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor membrane (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baylor et al., 1979</a>) and a reduction in the release of glutamate. This \u2018backwards\u2019 mechanism introduces much less noise into the signal and enhances contrast, which would be favorable for phase-locking to auditory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib49\">Palmer and Russell, 1986</a>). The high-order Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of synaptic vesicle release in apical gerbil IHCs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johnson et al., 2008</a>) enhances these \u2018off\u2019 periods when <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> is transformed into <i>P</i><sub>Release</sub> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>), which would further increase the signal contrast as it is relayed onto afferent fibers and push the boundary for phase-locking up to a higher frequency. The smaller overall <i>P</i><sub>Release</sub> of apical IHCs to the maximal predicted stimulation would be compensated by multivesicular (<a href=\"#bib24\">Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002</a>) or uniquantal (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chapochnikov et al., 2014</a>) release at individual ribbon synapses, generating large excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the afferent terminals, the size of which has been shown to be Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent and larger ones show more accurate phase-locking (<a href=\"#bib24\">Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Grant and Glowatzki, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2014</a>).

However, a generally smaller exocytotic response, as calculated for the maximal <i>P</i><sub>Release</sub> in apical IHCs (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E and F</a>), would again be favorable for maximizing response speed, at the expense of accurately signaling intensity.

By contrast, apical IHCs only showed signs of a DC component for large stimuli (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). The lower resting conductance of basal cells also means that their response amplitudes are bigger, although slower, than apical cells and are more spread out giving better discrimination between stimulus levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The overall linear Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of neurotransmitter release in adult gerbil basal IHCs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johnson et al., 2008</a>) would extend the dynamic range, enabling cells to accurately relay information from both low and high intensity sounds into afferent activity."

Low-frequency guinea pig IHCs respond to sound with a predominant AC component and a large hyperpolarization from rest (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dallos, 1986</a>). By contrast, the responses in high-frequency cells are dominated by the DC component (<a href=\"#bib52\">Russell and Sellick, 1978</a>), although when stimulated with low-frequency sound they also show an AC component but with little hyperpolarization from rest (<a href=\"#bib49\">Palmer and Russell, 1986</a>), indicative of a smaller resting MT current in basal cells. In vivo studies on IHCs and afferent fibers have independently suggested that there are intrinsic differences between apical and basal regions, which generate a resting bias for apical cells towards the \u2018on\u2019 or depolarized condition and basal cells to the \u2018off\u2019 hyperpolarized condition (<a href=\"#bib49\">Palmer and Russell, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ohlemiller and Siegel, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cheatham and Dallos, 1993</a>). A different resting bias would result from differences in the standing current through the IHCs (i.e., resting MT current), such that the larger current in apical cells would reduce the DC component to favor AC responses, whereas the smaller current in basal cells would enhance the DC <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> shifts. A different resting bias would also explain why afferent fibers in the gerbil generally have a higher spontaneous firing rate (SR) at the apex than those at base (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ohlemiller et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ohlemiller and Siegel, 1994</a>). Therefore, both low-frequency and high-frequency IHCs are specialized for their respective tasks, showing a preference for either timing or intensity coding, respectively. While low-frequency cells are able to respond rapidly and accurately to phasic stimuli at around the phase-locking limit, high-frequency cells show clearly defined graded shifts in membrane potential over an extended dynamic range. Evidence in support of a specialization of apical cells for phase-locking comes from in vivo recordings from chinchilla auditory nerve fibers showing that the strength of phase-locking in high-CF fibers starts to deteriorate at lower stimulus frequencies than that in low-CF fibers (<a href=\"#bib55\">Temchin and Ruggero, 2010</a>).

The patch pipette was tip-filled with the above normal potassium aspartate intracellular solution before back-filling with the amphotericin B containing solution to prevent leakage of the antibiotic onto the IHC prior to sealing onto the membrane. Data acquisition was controlled by pClamp software using a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices, USA). Voltage-clamp recordings were low-pass filtered at 2.5 kHz (8-pole Bessel) and sampled at 5 kHz. Current clamp steps were recorded at 5 kHz and filtered at 2.5 kHz and the sound-like stimulation protocols were recorded at 100 kHz and filtered at 20 or 50 kHz.

Mechanical stimuli were applied as 50\u2009Hz sinusoids (filtered at 0.5 kHz, 8-pole Bessel) with driving voltages of up to \u00b1 20 V. Positive driver voltage (fluid flowing out of the jet) caused hair bundles to move towards the taller stereocilia and produced excitatory responses. The pressure in the fluid jet was zeroed before approaching the IHC to ensure hair bundles were not displaced from their resting position. All recordings were carried out at body temperature and in the presence of the endolymph-like low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution (40 \u00b5M)."

At this stage the normal extracellular solution containing 1.3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> was changed to the low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> (40 \u00b5M) solution. The cochlear coils were then bath exposed to a low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution containing 3 \u03bcM FM1-43 for 8\u2009s and immediately washed several times with normal 1.3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> extracellular solution.

Concern was expressed, however, that the observed differences in the probability of opening of the transducer channel at rest might be due to the recording conditions used. Consequently, this and several other issues will need to be addressed before a final decision can be made."

The reviewers discussed the value of using perforated-patch recordings, where the cytoplasmic proteins are not washed out, or of using various calcium buffer concentrations in conjunction with whole-cell recording to address this issue. The same point was raised in the context of measurements of resting potential and membrane time constants. While they agreed that perforated-patch recordings present their own difficulties and are not essential for this study, the possibility that differences in calcium loading between basal and apical inner hair cells have to be considered. One of the reviewers also noted that there is a prior report of a tonotopic gradient in calcium-binding proteins (Pack and Slepecky, 1995)."

The same point was raised in the context of measurements of resting potential and membrane time constants. While they agreed that perforated-patch recordings present their own difficulties and are not essential for this study, the possibility that differences in calcium loading between basal and apical inner hair cells have to be considered.

However, published data from IHCs of the adult gerbil cochlea has demonstrated that the buffering strength is likely to be similar between apical and basal cells (Johnson et al., 2008). Despite this, I decided to verify this previous finding by recording voltage responses from mature apical and basal gerbil IHCs (P29-P36) using new perforated patch experiments. Rather than performing MT current recordings on mature IHCs using the fluid jet, which are extremely complex experiments even in whole-cell configuration, I used the cells holding current at -64 mV as a measure of the resting transducer current, which is responsible for determining the level of depolarization of the IHC at rest. The new data show that the holding current measured in endolymphatic extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was much larger in apical cells than basal cells. This holding current was linked to the MT current because it was selectively abolished by the application of the MT channel blocker DHS, indicating that the results in whole-cell are a true representation of the physiological condition in mature IHCs. This also shows that, as previously demonstrated (Johnson et al., 2008), the observed differences between apical and basal IHCs are not a direct consequence of possible differences in the endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer along the cochlea. Of course, this is unlikely to apply to OHCs (Johnson et al., 2011, Neuron). The new data are shown in the new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, described in the Results section (paragraphs two and three, subsection \u201cTonotopic differences in IHC basolateral membrane currents\u201d) and detailed in the second paragraph of the Methods."

Direct stimulation of the hair bundle would not be appropriate for this experiment mainly because the tall hair bundle of adult IHCs are easily damaged by repeated stimulation, which was a requirement for to collecting accurate and reliable data. Hair bundle damage would lead to differences in the stimulus intensity within the same cell and from cell to cell, making it very difficult to compare apical and basal cells. Dynamic clamp would do the same thing as injecting current in this case since it predicts the resulting current through the MT channels and applies it as a current injection. Dynamic clamp uses the conductance values to work out the current through the channel at different potentials, so effectively adds the channel to the cell. However, I just want to mimic the transducer current from the resting potential of the cell, so if I know what it should be at rest and during stimulation I can apply it to the cell and see how it responds. So, in some respect I am already doing dynamic clamp."
