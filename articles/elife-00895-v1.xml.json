Many proteins are synthesised and folded in the endoplasmic reticulum, and when this organelle is under stress (that is, when it is unable to cope with its workload), three sensors (called PERK, IRE1 and ATF6) send signals to the rest of the cell to perform two tasks: to coordinate various ways of reducing the expression of genes, and to increase the protein folding capacity of the cell to meet demand. This two-pronged response involves changes at both the transcriptional level (in the cell nucleus) and the translational level (in the cytoplasm)."

UPR stress sensors (blue ovals) localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ISR kinases (purple text) receive stress signals (not shown) and relay these (blue arrows) to the cytoplasm and nucleus to reduce the expression of genes. The PERK pathway is involved in both responses; the signal from IRE1 is relayed via a protein called XBP1. ISRIB acts downstream of the phosphorylation of eIF2 (eIF2(\u03b1P)) and upstream of the activation of ATF4 (green arrow) and the repression of bulk protein synthesis (red down arrow).

PERK works by phosphorylating a protein called eIF2 that is needed to start the translation of messenger RNA into strings of amino acids, which fold to form proteins. PERK is one of four protein kinases that phosphorylate eIF2 in mammals in response to different signals. eIF2 contains three subunits, and the four kinases all phosphorylate the same serine 51 location within the alpha subunit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Once phosphorylated, eIF2 forms a complex with a second factor called eIF2B, and this complex reduces the overall levels of protein synthesis within the cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>). Paradoxically, these stress-induced signalling events also enhance the translation of the messenger RNAs for some proteins, including a transcription factor called ATF4 that modulates the expression of various genes, to ameliorate the perceived stress. The actions of these four kinases in response to stress\u2014phosphorylation of eIF2 and increased translation of ATF4\u2014is termed the integrated stress response (ISR)."

They found a small molecule called ISRIB (short for ISR InhiBitor) that attenuates ATF4 induction without altering the IRE1 or ATF6 responses. Subsequent tests convincingly showed that this molecule does not prevent the activation of PERK or the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. This means that ISRIB\u2014unlike GSK2606414, a recently identified small molecule that inhibits PERK (<a href=\"#bib1\">Axten et al., 2012</a>)\u2014is not an eIF2\u03b1 kinase inhibitor. The UCSF-McGill-Genentech team also showed that ISRIB could prevent ATF4 expression following activation of two of the other kinases in the integrated stress response (GCN2 and HRI). Equally importantly, ISRIB also prevented the reduction in overall protein synthesis that is normally observed within cells when eIF2 phosphorylation is high following integrated stress response kinase activation. This shows that ISRIB is acting on protein synthesis control rather than an ATF4-specific response."

The prime candidate is eIF2B, which is normally inhibited by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, and Sidrauski et al. suggest that ISRIB might either boost eIF2B activity or reduce its sensitivity to eIF2 phosphorylation. Both are plausible ideas, but other explanations cannot yet be excluded. Genetic studies using yeast have identified many mutations in eIF2 and eIF2B that permit eIF2 phosphorylation but prevent the downstream signalling responses (<a href=\"#bib7\">Pavitt, 2005</a>). The impact of ISRIB on the integrated stress response appears to mimic the effects of these mutations."

By contrast, the induction of PKR\u2014one of the four kinases in the integrated stress response\u2014in neurons of the hippocampus increases eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and ATF4 expression, but again leads to impaired memory (<a href=\"#bib6\">Jiang et al, 2010</a>)."

Reduced eIF2\u03b1 signalling is also known to increase the sensitivity of cells to viral infection (<a href=\"#bib4\">Elsby et al., 2011</a>), so it seems possible that ISRIB could similarly reduce cellular resistance to viral infection.
