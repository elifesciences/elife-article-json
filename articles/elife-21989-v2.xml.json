Here, we report C-terminus mediated inhibition (CMI) for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 that multiple motifs coordinate to tune down Ca<sup>2+</sup> current and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx toward the lower limits determined by end-stage CDI (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation). Among IQ<sub>V</sub> (preIQ<sub>3</sub>-IQ domain), PCRD and DCRD (proximal or distal C-terminal regulatory domain), spatial closeness of any two modules, <i>e.g.</i>, by constitutive fusion, facilitates the trio to form the complex, compete against calmodulin, and alter the gating. Acute CMI by rapamycin-inducible heterodimerization helps reconcile the concurrent activation/inactivation attenuations to ensure Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is reduced, in that Ca<sup>2+</sup> current activated by depolarization is potently (~65%) inhibited at the peak (full activation), but not later on (end-stage inactivation, ~300 ms). Meanwhile, CMI provides a new paradigm to develop Ca<sub>V</sub>1 inhibitors, the therapeutic potential of which is implied by computational modeling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 dysregulations related to Parkinson\u2019s disease."

Here, we report C-terminus mediated inhibition (CMI) for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 that multiple motifs coordinate to tune down Ca<sup>2+</sup> current and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx toward the lower limits determined by end-stage CDI (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation). Among IQ<sub>V</sub> (preIQ<sub>3</sub>-IQ domain), PCRD and DCRD (proximal or distal C-terminal regulatory domain), spatial closeness of any two modules, <i>e.g.</i>, by constitutive fusion, facilitates the trio to form the complex, compete against calmodulin, and alter the gating. Acute CMI by rapamycin-inducible heterodimerization helps reconcile the concurrent activation/inactivation attenuations to ensure Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is reduced, in that Ca<sup>2+</sup> current activated by depolarization is potently (~65%) inhibited at the peak (full activation), but not later on (end-stage inactivation, ~300 ms). Meanwhile, CMI provides a new paradigm to develop Ca<sub>V</sub>1 inhibitors, the therapeutic potential of which is implied by computational modeling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 dysregulations related to Parkinson\u2019s disease."

Proteins known as calcium channels on the cell surface allow calcium ions to flow into the cell from the surrounding environment. Cells carefully control the opening and closing of these channels to prevent too many calcium ions entering the cell at once. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are a type of calcium channel that are important for the heart and brain to work properly. Defects in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels can lead to irregular heart rhythms and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease."

For the experiments, several versions of the protein were constructed with different combinations of tail modules being directly linked as part of the same molecule or present as separate molecules. When any two modules were directly linked, the third module could bind to them and this was enough to close the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel. However, the channel did not close if the modules were totally isolated from each other as three separate molecules."

In Parkinson\u2019s disease, increased movement of calcium ions into these neurons via Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels interferes with the rhythms of the signals and can cause these cells to die. Liu, Yang et al. performed computer simulations to analyse the effects of closing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in these neurons. The results suggest that this can restore normal rhythms of electrical activity and prevent these cells from dying."

Among four isoforms of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1\u2013Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 in LTCC family, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels exhibit unique biophysical properties (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lieb et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Xu and Lipscombe, 2001</a>) involving diverse regulatory mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ben-Johny and Yue, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Christel and Lee, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Huang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tan et al., 2011</a>).

Closely involved in both apoCaM and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jurado et al., 1999</a>), IQ<sub>V</sub> plays important roles in channel functions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ben Johny et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Singh et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wahl-Schott et al., 2006</a>). The competitive tuning is highly regulated by fluctuations of [apoCaM], the strength of particular DCT isoforms, or the apoCaM affinity with IQ<sub>V</sub> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bazzazi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). DCT consists of two putative \u03b1-helical domains\u2014a proximal and a distal C-terminal regulatory domain (termed PCRD and DCRD, respectively) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hulme et al., 2006</a>). Positively charged PCRD could coordinate with negatively charged DCRD, in the context of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Liu et al., 2010</a>), to regulate effective CaM affinity to\u00a0the IQ<sub>V</sub> region of the channel. Besides the reported inhibition on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Singh et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wahl-Schott et al., 2006</a>), several studies suggest that DCT also concurrently attenuates voltage-gated activation (VGA), reducing the\u00a0maximum open probability and positively shifting the voltage dependence (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hulme et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lieb et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Scharinger et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Singh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wahl-Schott et al., 2006</a>). Altogether, this competitive tuning of Ca<sub>V</sub>1 gating (activation/inactivation) emerges as a new modality distinct from conventional inhibitions such as intensively-studied Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers (CCBs) that normally only reduce VGA (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hockerman et al., 1997</a>), or Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-triggered conformational changes that induce CDI (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ben-Johny and Yue, 2014</a>). However, several key matters still remain to be clarified before such new CMI (<span class=\"underline\">C</span>-terminus <span class=\"underline\">M</span>ediated <span class=\"underline\">I</span>nhibition) could be fully established. First, PCRD, DCRD and IQ<sub>V</sub> seemingly work cooperatively to mediate CMI as suggested by aforementioned analyses, but the exact interrelationships among these three motifs are yet to be elucidated. Second, CMI is supposed to act on channels in an acute manner similar to widely-applied CCBs or like interventions, but direct evidence is still lacking. Third, CMI is expected to reduce the\u00a0overall Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx; however, it is still unclear whether and how CMI is able to ensure the actual inhibition when both VGA and CDI are attenuated, apparently leading to contradictory effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx."

Short variant of \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub> terminates shortly after the IQ<sub>V</sub> motif and lacks almost entire DCT domain, and its Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (<i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i>) exhibited strong CDI and VGA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Regarding CDI, \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub> still contains all the core elements including the IQ<sub>V</sub> domain for apoCaM pre-association and the EF-hand motifs and N-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding NSCaTE motif (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dick et al., 2008</a>) for CDI transduction. <i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i> upon depolarization rapidly decayed (second row, red trace), indicative of strong CDI. In contrast, Ba<sup>2+</sup> current (<i>I<sub>Ba</sub></i>) decayed rather slowly (trace in grey) representing the background voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI). Thus, the fraction of peak current (<i>I<sub>peak</sub></i>) remaining after depolarization for 50 ms (third row, <i>r<sub>50</sub></i>) is closely correlated with inactivation, with the difference between the <i>r<sub>50</sub></i> profiles in Ba<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> serving as the ideal index of CDI. In practice, due to rather weak VDI of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 at 50 ms (<i>r<sub>50,Ba</sub></i> close to 1) (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tadross et al., 2010</a>), thus for simplicity the value of 1\u2212<i>r<sub>50,Ca</sub></i> at \u221210 mV was taken as the index of CDI strength (<i>S<sub>Ca</sub></i>). VGA was evaluated by peak current density <i>J<sub>peak</sub></i> (<i>pA</i>/<i>pF</i>), measured at different voltages while excluding potential artifacts due to cell-size factor (capacitance). Throughout this study, <i>S<sub>Ca</sub></i> and <i>J<sub>Ca</sub></i> (<i>J<sub>peak</sub></i> at \u221210 mV) served as the quantitative indices for CDI and VGA respectively. Thus, by way of DCT competition against apoCaM, the provisional CMI was expected to attenuate both <i>S<sub>Ca</sub></i> and <i>J<sub>Ca</sub></i>, as suggested by prior studies (<a href=\"#bib45\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Singh et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tan et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wahl-Schott et al., 2006</a>). However, most of these reports focused on either CDI or VGA only; or even when both were studied for whole-cell <i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i>, CDI and VGA were separately evaluated with different experimental groups. Here, we conducted a\u00a0side-by-side analysis for each variant or condition, not only more confirmative since concurrent changes in CDI and VGA would be mutually supportive, but also critical to later insights into CMI mechanisms and significance originated from such concurrency. Technically, compared to VGA and <i>J<sub>Ca</sub></i>, CDI and <i>S<sub>Ca</sub></i> are more robust so more favorable since CDI of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 is independent of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> so insensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffer capacities and variations in channel expressions partly due to transient transfections (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dick et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tadross et al., 2008</a>). In general, for data and analyses we provided for both CDI and VGA, CDI (<i>S<sub>Ca</sub></i>) was considered as the major index for CMI evaluations and VGA as the supplement."

Such channel variant was simply denoted as \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub>-PCRD-DCRD, which represents CMI intrinsic to the long variant of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (\u03b1<sub>1DL</sub>) but with higher potency since strong DCRD<sub>F</sub> replaces endogenous DCRD<sub>D</sub>.

Since DCRD might need some structural freedom as in DCT or PCRD-DCRD, a glycine linker of different length (G<sub>X</sub>) was inserted between DCRD and IQ<sub>V</sub> to construct \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub>-G<sub>X</sub>-DCRD, mimicking the configurations that permit potent effects. From all these channel variants, we concluded no alteration in CDI in comparison with the \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub> control, similarly from VGA results and analyses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In general, current densities should be more carefully scrutinized before any conclusive claim on VGA; and effects on <i>J<sub>peak</sub></i> profiles and <i>J<sub>Ca</sub></i> values normally need to be\u00a0backed up by evaluations on concurrent CDI. For instance, current densities of \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub>-G<sub>X</sub>-DCRD (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, the three columns on right) seemed different from the control, potentially interpreted as mild CMI; however, considering that the changes in CDI of these channels were rather small, the mild changes in VGA should be considered as variations instead of conclusive attenuations. Statistical test of significance (Student\u2019s t-test) was performed subsequently to help identify significant CMI effects. Based on the fact that all the configurations under test failed to mediate <i>S<sub>Ca</sub></i> and <i>J<sub>Ca</sub></i> attenuations, all the three motifs of PCRD, DCRD and IQ<sub>V</sub> might be required for effective CMI, consistent with the preliminary analyses on DCT subsegments from Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4, in which the segment between PCRD and DCRD (\u2018B\u2019 region) was dispensable but neither PCRD nor DCRD could be excluded (<a href=\"#bib45\">Liu et al., 2010</a>)."

To alleviate the interference with the potential cooperation in forming the threesome complex, we managed to substantially reduce [apoCaM] in the\u00a0cells by overexpressing BSCaM<sub>IQ</sub>, a strong apoCaM buffer (<a href=\"#bib9\">Black et al., 2006</a>), to help identify the minimum requirement for CMI (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast to strong CDI in normal [apoCaM] evidenced from different channel variants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), with [apoCaM] being substantially reduced (but not lower than a realistic limit), surprisingly, \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub>-G<sub>24</sub>-DCRD and all the other DCRD-containing variants exhibited much attenuated CDI indicative of effective CMI (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Meanwhile, the stereotyped ultrastrong CDI normally observed from \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub> or \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub>-PCRD was nearly unaltered by apoCaM buffers, in that under the residue [apoCaM] these channels were still able to be pre-bound with apoCaM considering the effective affinity between apoCaM and the channel (IQ<sub>V</sub> or IQ<sub>V</sub>-PCRD) was reasonably high when there was no interference. Hence, mechanistically only DCRD and IQ<sub>V</sub> are required by CMI so that PCRD becomes dispensable if [apoCaM] is low, unveiling the differential roles of PCRD and DCRD in the potential cooperation for CMI induction."

To explore intermediate conditions between the two extremes, we physically linked every two modules out of the three to coexpress with the third one, yielding three possible combinations in total. And they were, PCRD-DCRD peptides to coexpress with IQ<sub>V</sub> (contained in \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, combination I), channels containing IQ<sub>V</sub>-PCRD to coexpress with DCRD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, combination II), and channels containing linked IQ<sub>V</sub> and DCRD to coexpress with PCRD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, combination III).

Instead of dealing with two different channel variants, here the same \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub> served as the control to reliably evaluate PCRD<sub>D</sub>-DCRD <i>vs</i> PCRD<sub>F</sub>-DCRD peptides.

(<b>D</b>) FRET 2-hybrid assays demonstrated that pre-linked IQ<sub>V</sub>-PCRD motif (YFP tagged) exhibited strong binding with CFP-DCRD, with higher binding affinity (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a01135, units in donor-cube fluorescence intensity) than the binding affinity (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a04700) between CFP-DCRD and YFP-IQ<sub>V</sub> itself (without PCRD being fused). Additional PCRD peptides did not make any appreciable change (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a04624) for the binding between CFP-DCRD and YFP-IQ<sub>V</sub>, unable to rescue the low affinity back to the high level that the constitutive PCRD fusion (YFP-IQ<sub>V</sub>-PCRD) could achieve. <i>FR<sub>max</sub></i> values for all these binding curves were similar (3.50\u20143.87). Each data point represented the <i>FR</i> (y-axis, FRET ratio) and <i>D<sub>free</sub></i> (x-axis, free donor concentration) values averaged over five adjacent individual cells sorted by <i>D<sub>free</sub></i>.

Grey circles represent the effective combinations, which require that at least two (out of three) components are closely engaged (<i>e.g.</i>, fusion) to form the trio complex incorporating the third (separate) component. The three key combinations are I (IQ<sub>V</sub>+PCRD-DCRD), II (IQ<sub>V</sub>-PCRD+DCRD) and III (IQ<sub>V</sub>-DCRD+PCRD), where \u2018\u2013\u2019 denotes fusion or spatial closeness and \u2018+\u2019 indicates the separate peptide to be coexpressed. In addition, the positive control (IQ<sub>V</sub>-PCRD-DCRD) also represents the native long variant \u03b1<sub>1DL</sub>; and the three components (dotted circles in green, pink and blue) completely separate to each other (IQ<sub>V</sub>+PCRD+DCRD) produce no CMI effect, serving as one negative control."

Owing to the high affinity between DCRD and IQ<sub>V</sub>-PCRD, DCRD overexpression nearly abolished the binding between apoCaM and IQ<sub>V</sub>-PCRD (<i>i.e.</i>, apoCaM/channel pre-association) as demonstrated in the plot of <i>FR-D<sub>free</sub></i> (FRET ratio <i>vs</i> free donor concentrations) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>); meanwhile, without the presence of PCRD, apoCaM was still able to bind IQ<sub>V</sub>, but the DCRD perturbation was much less effective (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

This explained why the potential contributions of these secondary interactions may or may not be evidenced, depending on whether the trio complex would come into being in particular settings.

FKBP (rapamycin-binding protein) and FRB fragment (FKBP and rapamycin binding domain of the kinase mTOR) as the tags were fused onto DCRD and PCRD, respectively. A small immunosuppressant molecule rapamycin that binds both FRB and FKBP was applied to link one FKBP-DCRD together with one PCRD-FRB, aiming to bind to the IQ<sub>V</sub> domain of \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub> to compete off apoCaM and thus induce CMI according to the scheme of combination I (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This design, if successful, should be directly applicable to native Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 since no modification is needed at the channel side. Attracted by such potentials, we implemented and validated this rapamycin-inducible peptide-mediated CMI in HEK cells with \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub>.

We reasoned that the underperformance here should be mainly due to the low effective concentration of the linked peptides if closely comparing constitutive (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and the rapamycin-inducible CMI (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The upgrade version (version 2) was designed to enhance concentration (local to channels) and thus the potency of CMI peptides. Membrane-targeting motif Ras (<a href=\"#bib74\">Yang et al., 2007</a>) was used to construct FRB-CFP-Ras, which would bind DCRD/PCRD tagged with FKBP through rapamycin-inducible heterodimerization. As demonstrated by confocal fluorescence imaging, in about two minutes YFP-FKBP-DCRD and YFP-FKBP-DCRD translocated to the membrane upon rapamycin application (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Meanwhile, FRB was also fused onto the channel to construct \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub>-G<sub>12</sub>-FRB for inducible dimerization with FKBP-PCRD or FKBP-DCRD, to facilitate peptide-mediated CMI according to the schemes of combination II and III (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). More potently than the earlier design but in a similar time course (version 1, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>), rapamycin induced strong CMI effects on <i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i> within 4\u20135 min (version 2, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Both CDI and VGA were substantially attenuated: <i>S<sub>Ca</sub></i> (0.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06, n\u00a0=\u00a05) and <i>I<sub>peak</sub></i> (35% \u00b1 3%, n\u00a0=\u00a05). Both indices reached the plateau within 4\u20135 min, which was about the speed of full solution exchange in our recording system, indicating that rapamycin perfusion was the major time-limiting factor. Thus, the acute nature of CMI was strongly supported by the temporal profiles of inducible CMI effects on CDI/VGA (both version 1 and version 2)."

Thick lines (semitransparent in red) represent the <i>J<sub>300,Ca</sub></i> profile of \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub> control. (<b>C</b>) Functional and the structural insights into the two modes of inhibition. DCT/apoCaM-dependent CMI and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-mediated CDI result in indistinguishable gating (green arrows) appearing due to similar causes, <i>i.e.</i>, either total or partial loss of the apo-state CaM/IQ<sub>V</sub> complex. That says, in CMI, apoCaM pre-association is totally lost; and in CDI, apoCaM is calcified and dislocated from the pre-association sites. Although the triggers are different for CMI <i>vs</i> CDI, <i>i.e.</i>, DCT competing (off apoCaM) <i>vs</i> Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding (onto apoCaM), the similarities between the two different inhibitory regulations of CMI and CDI invite the hypothesis that the core gating machinery (cyan squares) upon depolarization might step into the same scenario/mode including structural details (red arrows). A series of current traces (on the right) indicate CMI with different potency (enhanced from pink to cyan, upper), in comparison with the trace at different stages of CDI (developed from pink to cyan, lower) superimposed with the trace from ultrastrong CMI (dotted trace in cyan). These analyses point to one important notion that the lower limit of CMI is determined by end-stage CDI (the traces or the phases in cyan), and thus the dynamic changes for CMI effects on \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub> (indexed with <i>I<sub>peak</sub></i> and <i>S<sub>Ca</sub></i>) are preset, <i>i.e.</i>, from the pink (no CMI and ultrastrong CDI) to the cyan (ultrastrong CMI and no CDI)."

In Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels, C-termini of \u03b1<sub>1</sub> subunits are subject to proteolytic cleavage and the site of cleavage is located between PCRD and DCRD (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abele and Yang, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hulme et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2006</a>).

For Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3, the possibility of proteolytic cleavage has not yet been fully explored. Instead, DCT is subject to alternative splicing thus generating \u03b1<sub>1D</sub> isoforms in two major categories: with (\u03b1<sub>1DL</sub>) or without (\u03b1<sub>1DS</sub> or similar variants) autonomous CMI (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bock et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Singh et al., 2008</a>), both broadly expressed in various tissues and organs.

First of all, CMI as an emerging modality of channel inhibition resembles CDI, one of the prominent features of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ben-Johny and Yue, 2014</a>). Targeting the mechanisms of CDI, most structural efforts have been directed to channels in Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, evidenced by multiple studies focusing on Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM bound with key channel motifs such as IQ or IQ<sub>V</sub> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ben Johny et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fallon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mori et al., 2008</a>) and NSCaTE (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dick et al., 2008</a>), which have not achieved unequivocal viewpoints toward CDI mechanisms. CMI emphasizes on the importance of apoCaM-bound and apoCaM-off structures in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions, which represent the states of \u2018Activated\u2019 (pre-CMI) and \u2018Inhibited\u2019 (post-CMI), promisingly holding the key to understand the core mechanisms that control the gating of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Functionally, CMI helps clarify the long-standing complication on the\u00a0overall effects of CDI on the actual Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the cell. Historically, CDI is considered as a negative feedback to autonomously reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> entries (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alseikhan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Budde et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). On the other hand, stronger CDI is often accompanied with larger amplitude or facilitated activation of <i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Singh et al., 2008</a>), altogether raising the question whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is reduced or enhanced by CDI. Here we provide direct evidence that attenuation of CDI via endogenous factors and mechanisms is essentially a reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, assured by the fixed level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> current at the late phase of <i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>I<sub>300</sub></i> measured in this work, remaining the same regardless of the changes in <i>I<sub>peak</sub></i> or <i>S<sub>Ca</sub></i>. In this context, CMI (in inverse correlation to CDI strength) is the more direct index of channel inhibition. In contrast, CDI strength itself (<i>S<sub>Ca</sub></i>) could be changed by various mechanisms of action besides [apoCaM] tuning, which may or may not actually reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. For instance, channel mutations in congenital diseases, <i>e.g.</i>, Timothy syndrome (<a href=\"#bib62\">Splawski et al., 2004</a>), could cause less inactivation in <i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i> and thus elevate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entries. Also, small-molecule compounds could produce confounding effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by triggering multiple events opposed to each other (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hille, 2001</a>), <i>e.g.</i>, roscovintine (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yarotskyy et al., 2010</a>) reportedly damps activation and meanwhile enhances inactivation, raising uncertainties in its actual effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx."

It is currently believed that activity-dependent engagement of Ca<sub>V</sub>1 channels elevates mitochondrial oxidant stress and vulnerability of SNc neurons, contributing to disease progression of PD (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guzman et al., 2010</a>). Additional support also comes from clinical evidence that Ca<sub>V</sub>1 blockers for hypertension treatment, <i>e.g.</i>, 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs) appear to reduce the risk of PD (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pasternak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ritz et al., 2009</a>). However, concerns are raised on developing PD therapeutics based on DHP or like inhibitors. First of all, it has been argued whether Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 is indeed a prerequisite for pacemaking and autonomous oscillation, because of pharmacological complications of DHP, including non-specific side effects and discrepancies in dose dependence (<a href=\"#bib29\">Guzman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Putzier et al., 2009</a>).

Here, to advance the understanding, we clarify that multiple C-terminal motifs cooperatively and acutely compete apoCaM off the channel; and unveil that CMI functionally resembles CDI such that the maximum potency of CMI is preset by end-stage CDI, which also ensures CMI reduces the overall Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Moreover, as one major goal beyond basic biophysics, we achieve CMI-based peptides for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 of native forms, including the short splice variant \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub> in this work and potentially also the long variant \u03b1<sub>1DL</sub>, another major isoform in native tissues (<a href=\"#bib75\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). In parallel, one study focusing on CaM, the other side of the competition, speculated on CDI mechanisms as a simple CaM-off process based on the data produced with local enrichment of apoCaM (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams et al., 2014</a>), which, in our view, may have the follow concerns. First, prescreening is needed to control the baseline gating since CaM itself is very well expressed in cells and easily reaches concentrations high enough to diminish the dynamic space to gauge any further change in CDI (<a href=\"#bib45\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). Second, even with above practical issues being handled, any claims about CDI still await further proof with direct evidence based on actual inhibition such as CMI. Third, apoCaM, due to its central position and multifaceted roles in cell signaling (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cheung, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Chin and Means, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Guzman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hoeflich and Ikura, 2002</a>), is nearly impossible to develop into molecular tools and therapeutics."

The interactions among IQ, PCRD and DCRD can alter channel function (known as CMI) only when any two of them are tethered together by fusion protein or rapamycin-mediated heterodimerization. The spatial closeness of any two of these structural domains may strengthen their interactions enough to compete off the IQ-CaM interaction, which is suggested by experiments with reduced apoCaM and live cell FRET tw0-hybrid assays. This mechanism directly explains why the interactions among IQ, PCRD and DCRD reduce CDI. Previous studies suggest that CDI may actually close the channel by reducing activation and results in this study show that at the end of CDI and CMI the currents levels are the same, the overall results suggest that CMI may alter channel function similarly as CDI. The mechanism revealed by this manuscript explains well the different phenotypes of various L-type Ca channels. By computational modeling, the manuscript suggests physiological importance of CMI, and rapamycin-mediated heterodimerization experiments provided a novel rationale for pharmacological intervention of Ca channel function. The study is significant and the results in general provide a strong argument for the proposed mechanism."

We agree with the reviewer about measuring both VGA and CDI. Technically, CDI and its index SCa are more favorable because for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels CDI is independent of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> so insensitive to buffer capacities, variations in expression levels, or the general health of the cells, thus more robust than VGA (J<sub>Ca</sub>). In general, VGA and J<sub>Ca</sub>are less stable even when experimental conditions are well controlled. Basically, any conclusion on J<sub>Ca</sub>needs to be carefully drawn from pronounced changes. In fact, this was one of the motivations underlying chemical-inducible CMI, for us to confidently count on each individual cell to quantify VGA and other properties. In some cases, the mild changes in J<sub>Ca</sub>may lead to uncertainties which need to be confirmed by analyzing concurrent CDI changes.

Under the residue apoCaM in realistic cells, without DCRD competition, \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub> or \u03b1<sub>1DS</sub>-PCRD is still able to produce pronounced CDI similarly as in control conditions, owing to the fact that under these conditions apoCaM binds the channels (IQ<sub>V</sub> or IQ<sub>V</sub>-PCRD) reasonably well (Liu et al. 2010).

For PCRD and DCRD peptides, no binding was detected with the FRET two-hybrid assay (Liu et al. 2010). Nevertheless, this would not completely exclude all potential interactions between PCRD and DCRD. For instance, electrostatic interactions might exist between PCRD and DCRD in the holo-channel of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 (Hulme et al. 2005), provided that the major binding has been established in the first place, e.g., between IQ<sub>V</sub>-PCRD and DCRD. The important consensus here is that even if the putative PCRD/DCRD interactions exist, they should be weaker than the binding between IQ<sub>V</sub> and DCRD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>); and the latter binding is further enhanced by the presence of PCRD in the close vicinity to IQ<sub>V</sub> or DCRD, which might be partly contributed by PCRD/DCRD interaction. We have revised the text to incorporate some of the above facts and analyses (subsection \u201cCooperative scheme of CMI consists of three major combinations\u201d)."

For constitutive CMI, \u201cend-stage\u201d CMI refers to the full-strength CMI or complete competition, which was closely approached but not yet fully reached in most experiments (but see very strong CMI effects in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In contrast, end-stage CDI in this work always refers to the time domain, reaching its steady state at ~300 ms or later. As suggested by the whole-cell I<sub>Ca</sub> from ensemble channels, we have concluded that the particular channel inhibited by CMI (with CDI abolished) should be functionally equivalent to the channel (e.g., with no CMI) into its end-stage CDI. Provided that VDI is negligible, I<sub>Ca</sub> attenuated by full-strength CMI (evaluated at 0 ms, I<sub>peak</sub>) would be equal to I<sub>Ca</sub> at the end stage of CDI (\u2265300 ms, e.g., I<sub>300</sub>), as our data of rapamycin-inducible CMI (version 2) strongly suggest (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."
