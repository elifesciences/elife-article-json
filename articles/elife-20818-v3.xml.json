Here, we report the structure of the active form of human ORC determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. The complex is composed of an ORC1/4/5 motor module lobe in an organization reminiscent of the DNA polymerase clamp loader complexes. A second lobe contains the ORC2/3 subunits. The complex is organized as a double-layered shallow corkscrew, with the AAA+ and AAA+-like domains forming one layer, and the winged-helix domains (WHDs) forming a top layer. CDC6 fits easily between ORC1 and ORC2, completing the ring and the DNA-binding channel, forming an additional ATP hydrolysis site. Analysis of the ATPase activity of the complex provides a basis for understanding ORC activity as well as molecular defects observed in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome mutations."

Here, we report the structure of the active form of human ORC determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. The complex is composed of an ORC1/4/5 motor module lobe in an organization reminiscent of the DNA polymerase clamp loader complexes. A second lobe contains the ORC2/3 subunits. The complex is organized as a double-layered shallow corkscrew, with the AAA+ and AAA+-like domains forming one layer, and the winged-helix domains (WHDs) forming a top layer. CDC6 fits easily between ORC1 and ORC2, completing the ring and the DNA-binding channel, forming an additional ATP hydrolysis site. Analysis of the ATPase activity of the complex provides a basis for understanding ORC activity as well as molecular defects observed in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome mutations."

ORC and CDC6 then function as an ATP-dependent assembler that first recruits a ring-shaped MCM2-7 hexamer with bound Cdt1 to DNA, and then loads a second MCM2-7 hexamer in a head-to-head orientation, whereby this double hexamer is topologically linked to double-stranded DNA (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib43\">O'Donnell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Siddiqui et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bell and Labib,\u00a02016</a>]).

In budding yeasts, ORC is a stable complex consisting of five AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) related subunits and another subunit, Orc6. Orc1, Orc4 and Orc5 are bona-fide members of a large class of AAA+ proteins that contain the characteristic Walker-A and Walker-B motifs, but the only active ATPase in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> ORC is the Orc1 subunit with its adjacent Orc4 subunit that contributes an activating arginine finger and other residues required for ORC function in vivo (<a href=\"#bib39\">Loo et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Klemm et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bowers et al., 2004</a>).

Recently, a high-resolution crystal structure of the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> ORC (DmORC) was reported (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bleichert et al., 2015</a>). This structure contains truncated versions of ORC1, ORC2, and ORC3, full-length ORC4 and ORC5, and a small fragment of ORC6. The overall shape of the crystal structure matches the shape observed in the low-resolution EM structures of this complex. The DmORC was captured in a state that is inactive for ATP hydrolysis by ORC1, the most critical ATPase subunit. This is because the interface between ORC1 and ORC4 and thus the ATP-binding site is disrupted, even though one of the crystal forms reported bound nucleotide. This state of the complex would have to undergo a substantial conformational transition in order to become functionally active for ATP hydrolysis, as noted by the authors."

The overall architecture of the HsORC motor module resembles a cashew nut (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Each ORC subunit is comprised of three domains \u2013 the RecA-fold, the \u03b1-helical lid and the \u03b1-helical winged-helix domain (WHD), although the WHD domain was truncated in ORC5. The RecA-fold domain and the lid together constitute the well-known AAA+ domain. The three RecA domains form a semicircle with ATP nucleotides wedged between them in a classic AAA+ oligomerization arrangement (see below). The RecA and lid domains of ORC1 contact the RecA domain of ORC4 as if cupping that domain between the two. The same is true for the RecA and lid domains of ORC4 cupping the RecA domain of ORC5. Remarkably, the three ORC subunits have the exact same organization of the three domains with respect to each other and can be readily superimposed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). The domains arrange themselves into a right-handed helical architecture with a\u00a0~52\u00b0 rotation and 2 \u00c5 rise (58\u00b0 rotation with a 2.05 \u00c5 rise from the AAA+ of ORC1 to ORC4; and 46\u00b0 rotation with a 2.3 \u00c5 rise from the AAA+ of ORC4 to ORC5)."

Both the architecture of the subunits and the organization of the domains with respect to each other are remarkably similar, although HsORC is somewhat shallower. The rotations between subunits for several clamp loaders range between 56\u00b0 and 74\u00b0 with rises in the range of 2.8 to 8.0 \u00c5, excluding a couple of outliers that appear to be in an inactive conformation. The clamp loaders are ATPases that perform a single ATPase cycle to pry open a closed DNA polymerase clamp ring in order to load it onto the double helix of DNA (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kelch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hedglin et al., 2013</a>), in contrast to the continuously hydrolyzing AAA+ helicases (<a href=\"#bib21\">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2008</a>).

Despite the ATPase function of the HsORC motor module, the electron density indicates that ATP hydrolysis had not occurred. We note that the crystals appeared in less than a day and reproducibly disappeared after an additional day if not promptly harvested and frozen. The conformation and placement of the three nucleotides is also quite similar, apart from a rotation of the adenine base with respect to the sugar (the angle of the glycosidic bond) and the absence of an additional subunit that would complete the binding site for ATP in ORC5 (see below)."

The nucleotide-binding sites are characteristic of AAA+ ATPases of this family (<a href=\"#bib21\">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hauk and Berger, 2016</a>). For the nucleotides at the subunit interfaces: Walker-A (P-loop) and Walker-B motifs from the RecA domain of one subunit line one side of the ATP nucleotide and three basic residues line the other side (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a>). The first basic residue, the \u2018trigger\u2019, is the sensor-2 residue. Specifically, it is ORC1-R720 for the first (ORC1-ORC4) interface and ORC4-R277 for the second (ORC4-ORC5) interface. The trigger emanates from the lid domain of the subunit that contributes the Walker-A and -B residues to the binding site and is most similar to the F1-ATPase arginine finger (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kagawa et al., 2004</a>). The trigger is what differentiates an ATP-bound and ATP-hydrolyzing configuration. The precise positioning of this residue appears to regulate the reactivity of the site, with the ATP-hydrolyzing configuration stabilizing the hydrolysis transition state (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kagawa et al., 2004</a>). In ATPases that function continuously, such as helicases, the trigger usually resides on the neighboring subunit to the one harboring the Walker-A and -B motifs, whereas in ATPases such as ORC, and the clamp loader RFC, where there is probably a single hydrolysis event, the trigger resides on the same subunit (<a href=\"#bib21\">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2008</a>). Factors that interact with the lid domain may have a profound effect on the positioning of the lid domain and therefore the trigger and consequently on the activation of ORC ATPase activity. Interestingly, the ORC1 trigger residue is mutated in a Meier-Gorlin Syndrome (MGS) patient (ORC1-R720Q) who also carries a mutation (ORC1-R105Q) in the amino-terminus that disrupts ORC1\u2019s Cyclin E-CDK2 inhibitory activity and histone H4K20me2 binding (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hossain and Stillman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kuo et al., 2012</a>). MGS patients with ORC1 mutations display the most severe phenotype of short stature and microcephaly (<a href=\"#bib14\">de Munnik et al., 2012a</a>)."

It is ORC4-R209 at the first interface and ORC5-R143 at the second interface. The third basic residue, the \u2018tether\u2019, forms contacts between the R-finger side of the interface to the Walker-A, -B side. ORC4-R205 performs this function at the first interface as it contacts the Walker-B residue E621 as well as D623 of ORC1. However, a second tether is formed by ORC4-Y174, which interacts with ORC1-E621 as well. ORC4-Y174 is also mutated in three MGS patients (ORC4-Y174C) and is conserved in all ORC4 subunits from yeast to mammals. We suggest that in addition to the well-known R-finger, this tyrosine plays a critical role in sensing the nucleotide state at this critical interface. Indeed, a tyrosine exists at a comparable position in ORC1 (ORC1-Y634) that is highly conserved, but a proline occupies that position in ORC5 (ORC5-P139). We predict that ORC1-Y634 interacts with the CDC6 Walker-B motif (CDC6-E285) in a similar fashion (see below). At the second P-loop interface between ORC4 and ORC5, we identify ORC5-R104 as the tether as it forms a salt bridge with ORC4-E113."

The missing elements needed for ATP hydrolysis, in particular the arginine finger and the tether, would normally be contributed by a neighboring subunit. In the context of the full complex, the RecA fold of ORC3 would occupy the neighboring subunit position (see below), and would be the subunit that would contribute the two other basic residues - the arginine finger (piston) and the tether. The position of the arginine finger on the RecA fold in HsORC1, HsORC4 and HsORC5 is invariable. However, the equivalent residue on the RecA fold of ORC3 is not an arginine but a leucine (HsORC3-L270). There are arginines on either side, however (HsORC3-R98 and HsORC3-R261), that could serve in this capacity for the nucleotide at the HsORC5-HsORC3 interface, if they are positioned properly in the full complex (see below)."

The motor module displayed robust ATPase activity, which was independent of DNA binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). To test which of the ATPase sites were functional in the motor module, we mutated several key residues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Disrupting the ORC1 Walker-B motif (ORC1 D620A) effectively abolished ATPase activity, while mutation of the ORC4 Walker-B motif (ORC4 D159A) had little effect. A double mutant of the Walker-B motif of both ORC1 and ORC4 also abolished activity. We therefore conclude that in the context of the motor module, only the ORC1/4 interface is a functional ATPase. This is in agreement with previous studies in budding yeast where ORC has a single ATPase consisting of ScOrc1 activated by an ScOrc4 R-finger (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bowers et al., 2004</a>). The unusual R69 in the Walker-A motif of ORC4 was mutated to test whether its interaction with the Walker-B motif is functional. However, a mutation to valine resulted in similar activity to wild type. Interestingly, the two MGS mutations discussed earlier resulted in very different behaviors with respect to modulation of ATPase activity. ORC1-R720Q abolished ATPase activity of the motor module, and this mutation exists in a single heterozygous individual with a wild-type allele, whereas the ORC4-Y174C mutation in the ORC4 tether, which disrupts its hydrogen bond to an ORC1 Walker-B side chain (ORC1-E621), renders the motor module hyperactive for ATPase activity. Together, these data suggest that properly regulated ATPase levels of HsORC are critical for tissue homeostasis in vivo. The more complete wild-type HsORC particle (containing ORC1-5) has a more robust ATPase activity, as do the ORC4 and ORC5 Walker-B mutated versions. However, the ORC1 Walker-B mutant, the ORC1 Walker-B / ORC4 Walker-B double mutant, as well as the ORC1 MGS mutation R720Q all show very little activity, similar to the situation in the motor module alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The ORC4 MGS mutant Y174C has reduced activity (at about 50% of wild type) in the context of ORC1-5. Thus, the hyperactivity of this mutant observed in the context of the motor module alone suggests that binding of ORC2-ORC3 modulates the ATPase activity of the ORC motor. It should be noted that the ORC4-Y174C mutation exists either as a homozygous mutation in one individual or a heterozygous combined with a null mutation in two individuals (<a href=\"#bib15\">de Munnik et al., 2012b</a>)."

However, the architecture and placement of ORC1 is very different. In DmORC, this subunit adopts an unusual conformation, as noted by the authors, whereby the RecA-fold and lid domains, comprising the entire AAA+ domain, are swung out to a different side of the complex, packing against DmORC2, so that it disrupts the ATP-binding site and would therefore be inactive (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). The functional significance of the DmORC structure is not known. In contrast, the human ORC is active as an ATPase and the RecA-fold and lid domains of HsORC1 form a classic ATPase site as described above, rotated almost 80\u00b0 from the position in DmORC. The WHDs of HsORC1 and DmORC1, on the other hand, are positioned in an almost identical manner."

The purified HsORC1-5 described here is a fairly unstable complex, consistent with the dynamic assembly and disassembly of HsORC in vivo. It was purified with ATP and is active for ATP hydrolysis. As a consequence, only a small percentage of the particles viewed by cryoEM were similar to the low-resolution EM structures of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and the HsORC1-5 obtained from negative stain EM (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Thus, we reasoned that using this subset of particles in order to obtain a low-resolution structure into which we could fit the crystal structures of the subcomplexes (ORC1/4/5 and ORC2/3) was warranted. Cryo-EM data were collected on a Gatan K2 summit direct electron detector in a Titan Krios electron microscope operating at 300 kV, resulting in a\u00a0~20 \u00c5 resolution 3D density map (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4s7\">7</a>). We docked the crystal structure of the HsORC motor module into the EM map, which had an excellent fit. Residual density in the EM map near HsORC1 could be explained by the presence of the 14 kDa Sumo tag on the N-terminus of the truncated HsORC1 construct used for the EM experiment. Although our crystals of the HsORC2/3 complex diffracted only to 6.0 \u00c5, with four complexes in the asymmetric unit, we were able to obtain phases by molecular replacement using the DmORC subunits (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bleichert et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The resulting electron-density map was clear enough to show a significant movement of helices in ORC3 compared to the DmORC structure (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, the position of the WHD of ORC2 would result in significant clashes for two of the four ORC2 copies present in the crystal. This indicated to us that the structures were suitable for docking into the HsORC cryoEM reconstruction. A separate structure of the WHD of HsORC2 is available (PDB code: 5C8H) and a model for the WHD of ORC5 was built based on DmORC followed by energy minimization. These models were docked into the HsORC cryoEM map and subjected to refinement by keeping the motor module ORC1/4/5, the RecA fold of ORC2 and the complete ORC3, the WHD of ORC5 and the WHD of ORC2 as four discrete rigid bodies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>) (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

                                "text": "HsORC has the appearance of a right-handed corkscrew composed of the AAA+ and WHD of all the subunits, and a \u2018decorative\u2019 handle made of the large helical domain of ORC3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b,c</a>). We did not include the small, non-AAA+ ORC6 subunit in this analysis because HsORC1-5 assembly is independent of ORC6 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Vashee et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Siddiqui and Stillman, 2007</a>). The RecA and RecA-like folds of the subunits (ORC 1, 4, 5, 3 and 2) form one layer of the corkscrew, with a little gap between the RecA-like domains of ORC3 and ORC2. The WHDs form a second layer with each domain sitting atop the RecA domain of the neighboring subunit. The structure of HsORC has an open ring architecture with a\u00a0~35 \u00c5 central channel, in contrast to the closed and more restricted central channel of\u00a0~15 \u00c5 observed in DmORC (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bleichert et al., 2015</a>). This larger opening can now easily accommodate a DNA double helix. Apart from the similarity between ORC4 and ORC5 discussed above, the WHD of HsORC5 is also positioned similarly as in DmORC, and HsORC3 is similar in position and arrangement as in the fly counterpart as is the RecA-like fold of HsORC2. However, in addition to the drastic reorientation of HsORC1 in comparison with DmORC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>), the position of the WHD of HsORC2 is also clearly very different between the two complexes. In HsORC, it is moved out and up from the central groove and is not interacting with HsORC1, as it would in DmORC if the AAA+ domain of DmORC1 was moved to a similar position as in HsORC (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The consequence of this repositioning is that it opens up the central groove in HsORC considerably (see below) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>) (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The RecA-like fold of ORC3 is now positioned near the AAA+ domain of ORC5, which is bound by a nucleotide. ORC3 does not have the characteristic side chains positioned at the ATP site to promote hydrolysis. However, even though there is no arginine positioned on the RecA fold in an equivalent position as it\u00a0is in HsORC1, HsORC4 or HsORC5\u2019s arginine fingers (or pistons), there is an arginine (R98) that could be interacting with the nucleotide bound to ORC5. An ORC5 Walker-B aspartate (D125) as well as ORC3-R98 were mutated in the context of HsORC1-5, and both are only slightly reduced for ATPase activity compared with wild-type activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). This indicates that the ORC5-ORC3 interface does not significantly contribute to the observed ATPase activity of the HsORC1-5 complex."

It is also an AAA+ ATPase with 29% sequence identity to ORC1, and in budding yeast, it\u00a0is an active ATPase (<a href=\"#bib46\">Randell et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Speck and Stillman, 2007</a>). Both yeast and human ORC1 and CDC6 interact with each other (<a href=\"#bib54\">Speck et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Speck and Stillman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hossain and Stillman, 2016</a>). We posit that CDC6 binds ORC1 with the same type of repeat arrangement as ORC1, ORC4 and ORC5 bind each other. We therefore built a homology model of CDC6 based on our structure of ORC1 and placed it with respect to ORC1 in the same relative arrangement as ORC1 is to ORC4 along with a putative ATP nucleotide between the two subunits in the same manner (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a,b</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). CDC6 fits within the HsORC model as if it were the missing piece in a puzzle. It completes the ring structure with its RecA domain between those of ORC1 and ORC2 on one layer and its WHD between those of ORC1 and ORC2 on the WHD layer. The ATP-binding site that is formed has all the characteristic residues in the proper positions. The CDC6 lid residue R388 is in the equivalent position as ORC1-R720 to act as the trigger. The helix of ORC1 that includes residues 661\u2013674 is disordered in our structure, but by homology to ORC4, they would contain the R-finger as R666 and the tether as R670 in the proper position. Furthermore, the ORC1-Y634 discussed above points directly to the CDC6 Walker-B motif, specifically to CDC6-E285."

This is one of the few structures of clamp loaders with DNA bound and was close in the relative orientations of the subunits to that of HsORC. We superimposed chains B, C and D of gp44 onto HsORC1/4/5. We used the resulting position of the DNA bound to gp44 and superimposed a longer canonical B-form, double-stranded DNA. The three RecA-folds of the AAA+ domains in ORC1, ORC4 and ORC5 wrap beautifully around the DNA double helix, tracking the minor groove of DNA and in the context of HsORC1-5, so does the RecA-like domain of ORC3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The WHDs contact the DNA seemingly through the major groove. The channel is wider than a snug fit to the DNA all around, although we expect (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sun et al., 2013</a>) it to be in closer proximity to the active ATPase motor module elements."

In the absence of ATP hydrolysis, ORC-Cdc6 recruits the first Mcm2-7 hexamer that is bound to Cdt1, but the hexamer bound to the double-stranded DNA is not salt resistant (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Duzdevich et al., 2015</a>). Thus, ATPase activity is required for loading the Mcm2-7 hexamer onto DNA, resulting in a salt-resistant complex. Cdc6 is then released followed by the\u00a0release of Cdt1 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ticau et al., 2015</a>). Another Cdc6 subunit is then involved in the recruitment of a second Cdt1-bound Mcm2-7 hexamer. ATP hydrolysis is linked to the\u00a0removal of the second Cdc6 and the subsequent removal of Cdt1 and ORC from the origin (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ticau et al., 2015</a>). Analogous to the clamp loader ATPases, we suggest that ATP hydrolysis by ORC-CDC6 would push down on\u00a0the first MCM2-7 hexamer to trigger the\u00a0Cdt1 release and allow recruitment of the second MCM2-7 \u2013 Cdt1 complex."

The structure of the yeast ORC-CDC6 complex determined by cryoEM is also similar to the structure we determined for human ORC and the model for human ORC-CDC6. Both HsORC and ScORC are in an active, ATPase state ready to function as a molecular motor, whereas the DmORC is in an inactive state that may be used for storage of these particles in the egg (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bleichert et al., 2015</a>). The similarity of the human and yeast protein-loading machines is remarkable despite the fact that they interact with DNA in fundamentally different ways and that the yeast protein is stable during the cell division cycle, whereas the human complex is dynamically assembled and disassembled. Both are also highly similar to the DNA polymerase clamp-loading ATPases, showing that ATP-driven molecular machines that load ring-shaped proteins onto DNA have been re-purposed for multiple stages of DNA replication."

Contrast transfer function parameters of each aligned micrograph were calculated using the program CTFFIND4 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</a>). All remaining steps, including semiautomatic particle picking, 2D classification, 3D classification, 3D refinement, and density map post-processing were performed using Relion-1.4 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Scheres, 2015</a>). Many particles appeared to be disassociated HsORC1/4/5 and HsORC2/3 subcomplexes. Guided by several published homologous ORC structures from yeast and Drosophila, we were able to manually select intact particles. We manually picked\u00a0~3000 particles in different views to generate initial 2D averages, which were used as templates for subsequent automatic particle selection (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Automatic particle selection was then performed for the entire data set. 532,782 particles were initially selected. The particles were then carefully examined and \u2018bad\u2019 particles were removed. 2D classifications of all remaining particles were performed (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4c</a>) and particles in unrecognizable or partial classes by visual inspection were removed. Particles were then sorted by similarity to the 2D references; the 10% of particles with the lowest z-scores were deleted from the particle pool. A total of 100,543 particles were used for 3D classification (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). We derived six 3D models from the dataset and found only one model suitable for further refinement; the other five models were distorted or partial structures and those particles were discarded, leading to a dataset size of 10,357 particles. This selection was aided by significant prior knowledge of the general shape and size of the ORC structure. Because of the small dataset size and somewhat uneven angular distribution, we took a conservative approach and binned the particle images by a factor of 4, leading to a final sampling of 4.04 \u00c5 per pixel. The binned dataset was used for further 3D refinement, resulting in the described 3D-density map. The resolution of the map was estimated to be 18 \u00c5 by the so-called gold standard Fourier shell correlation, at a correlation cutoff of 0.143. However, the FSC curve started to drop off at a resolution as low as 30 \u00c5, likely due to uneven angular distribution (<a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), suggesting that the map may only contain reliable information up to\u00a0~20 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#fig4s7\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 7</a>).

The HsORC2/3 model without the HsORC2 WHD was then docked into the map, followed by a homology model of the WHD of HsORC5 built using the fly homolog. A blob of density emanating from the RecA-fold domain of ORC2 was a clear indication for the positioning of the WHD of HsORC2, using the available structure (PDB code 5C8H). Refinement was done by keeping the motor module ORC1/4/5, the RecA fold of ORC2, the complete ORC3, the WHD of ORC5 and the WHD of ORC2 as discrete rigid bodies. Flexible fitting resulted in reorientation of ORC subunits without biological justification, and therefore not used."

Reactions were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and quenched with 2 \u03bcl of 500 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). 2 \u03bcl of each reaction was then spotted on a PEI-cellulose TLC plate (Selecto Scientific,\u00a0Suwanee,\u00a0GA), developed using 0.8 M LiCl and 0.8 M acetic acid as solvent, and quantified on a Phosphorimager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). For kinetic analyses, 10 \u03bcM HsORC was incubated with a titration of total ATP concentrations (cold and radioactive) of 12.5\u2013200 \u03bcM in the aforementioned buffer. Reaction rate remained linear at least for 30 min (data not shown), and the ATP hydrolysis rate was used as the initial velocity for kinetic analyses. Initial velocity was plotted against total ATP concentrations for Michaelis-Menten equation fitting (GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, CA)."

To complement and confirm the crystal structure, the authors also report a cryo-EM structure of the five-subunit HsORC1-5 with the sixth subunit CDC6 missing. This follows work from the Berger lab published in Nature last year of the (almost) complete structure of the <i>Drosophila</i> Orc. The Berger structure was of the inactive (nucleotide free) state of the complex and it also lacked the N-terminal regions of Orc1, Orc2 and Orc3 and the Orc6 TFIIB region. Similar deletions were used for these human ORC sub complexes in the present work (N-terminal deletions of Orc1 and Orc2 plus C-terminal deletion of Orc5). Orc6 is omitted entirely. Although the Berger crystal structure contained a more complete ORC complex from <i>Drosophila</i> (DmORC1-5), that structure represents a repressed state with Orc1 adopting an inactive domain arrangement. In contrast, the crystal structure of HsORC1/4/5 in the present work contains three ATPs bound at inter-subunit interfaces as expected, and the motor module is in an active form and similar to the structures of the clamp loader RFC from yeast, <i>E. coli</i> and T4 phage. The low resolution EM structure confirms the subunit arrangement revealed by the crystal structure and includes the two missing subunits ORC2 and ORC3. The ATPase activity assay and characterization of disease mutations further strengthen the structural results."

Thus, in principle, the scope of this work makes it suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i>. Nevertheless, the reviewers have identified two sets of serious issues with the paper. One issue can, presumably, be dealt with through revision, but the other, concerning the cryoEM data, will require extensive reanalysis of data, or acquisition of new data. The reviewers and the editors feel that the EM analysis is essential to the conclusions of the paper, but that it will have to be significantly improved, augmented and validated before this work can be considered for publication in <i>eLife</i>. The reviewers also note that for the EM to support the conclusions of the paper, a resolution of 10 \u00c5 is not necessary. A reliable reconstruction at lower resolution, say 20 \u00c5, would be fine, provided that it is indeed reliable and validated."

At 10 \u00c5 resolution hints of \u03b1-helices should be visible in the density. It is also puzzling that the 2D classes in the Figure 3 supplement show detail that would be consistent with a 10 \u00c5 structure. How do these 2D classes relate to the final model? How many particles are averaged here and are these the from the final 10,000? There needs to be considerably more information to assess this and the model they present especially with respect to the Berger model of the inactive form of the complex."

The remaining 100,000 particles were divided into 6 classes and they then chose a class with just 10,000 particles, which can't even have been the largest class. This means the cryoEM structure actually represents less than 2% of the primary particles. Consequently, there is little confidence as to what this subset might represent. If it were representative of a selected subset that were, for example, a different conformation, it would still require considerable care and biochemical backup to validate this selection. A concern is that the majority of the particles may be \"distressed\" particles that are missing subunits, etc. The image shown in the supplementary would support this view as there seems to be many small particles that are probably partial complexes. Under such conditions, one needs to take great care (and have significant justification) in selecting out such a small subset for detailed analysis without describing what the other particles might represent."

The Methods do not mention anything about map validation. A stringent test would be to randomize all phases above 20 or 30 \u00c5 and then see if they come back during refinement. This will almost certainly show that the actual resolution is somewhere between 20 and 30 \u00c5."

In fact, the Berger coordinates were used for molecular replacement, although the methods do not say whether they were used as a single unit in each case (Orc1, 4, 5 and Orc2, 3) or the subunits were found separately. We presume the latter, since the paper suggests the conformations are different although the only comparison of the structures is of one subunit in the panel in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>.

Clamp loading is one pertinent example since they draw several comparisons with that system.

It seems that the main problem is that the complex is falling apart during the freezing process (as seen also with many other complexes). This would explain the heterogeneity, the fact that only 2% of the particles can be merged into a 3D structure and that many particles are misaligned and thus give rise to the decent-looking angular distribution even though the 2D class averages show only a few recognizable views. The likely remaining heterogeneity and misalignment in the final 10k particles may also explain why the FSC looks so unusual.

However, the yeast ORC complex has a footprint measured to be 88bp. To explain this discrepancy the authors propose a model in which the ORC complex greatly elongates upon ATP hydrolysis to extend its footprint from 20bp to 88bp. While an extension after ATP hydrolysis is feasible (and likely given the precedent of other AAA+/DNA complexes), it seems highly unlikely that the footprint of one complex is extended by over 4-fold. This would require that each subunit would protect ~15 bp, instead of the more typical 2-4bp seen in other AAA+ machines. This explanation seems so far-fetched as to be unreasonable. Please explain."

This means the cryoEM structure actually represents less than 2% of the primary particles. Consequently, there is little confidence as to what this subset might represent. If it were representative of a selected subset that were, for example, a different conformation, it would still require considerable care and biochemical backup to validate this selection. A concern is that the majority of the particles may be \"distressed\" particles that are missing subunits, etc. The image shown in the supplementary would support this view as there seems to be many small particles that are probably partial complexes.

There is usually an R-finger, but this is different in different ATPases \u2013 most notably the R-finger of the F1 ATPase refers to the first arginine, whereas in some of the helicases the R-finger is the middle one. However, it appears that their position is linked more appropriately to their role in ATP hydrolysis in these types of molecular machines than the names they were initially given. We therefore tried to sort this out a few years ago, so as to be able to be more explicit when referring to these residues across the different types of these multi-subunit ATPases. We named these basic residues according to their role. This was published a few years ago in a review we wrote. However, since this is not widely used yet, we did explain what we meant by \u201ctrigger\u201d etc. in the subsection \u201cThe nucleotide binding sites\u201d, nevertheless, more was added for additional clarification. We also added labels in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. In the case of basic residues on ORC3 for the ORC5-ORC3 interface, we clarified what we are referring to in the text."

However, the yeast ORC complex has a footprint measured to be 88bp. To explain this discrepancy the authors propose a model in which the ORC complex greatly elongates upon ATP hydrolysis to extend its footprint from 20bp to 88bp. While an extension after ATP hydrolysis is feasible (and likely given the precedent of other AAA+/DNA complexes), it seems highly unlikely that the footprint of one complex is extended by over 4-fold. This would require that each subunit would protect ~15 bp, instead of the more typical 2-4bp seen in other AAA+ machines. This explanation seems so far-fetched as to be unreasonable.
