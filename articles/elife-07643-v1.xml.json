                    "text": "Sleep disturbances negatively impact numerous functions and have been linked to aggression and violence. However, a clear effect of sleep deprivation on aggressive behaviors remains unclear. We find that acute sleep deprivation profoundly suppresses aggressive behaviors in the fruit fly, while other social behaviors are unaffected. This suppression is recovered following post-deprivation sleep rebound, and occurs regardless of the approach to achieve sleep loss. Genetic and pharmacologic approaches suggest octopamine signaling transmits changes in aggression upon sleep deprivation, and reduced aggression places sleep-deprived flies at a competitive disadvantage for obtaining a reproductive partner. These findings demonstrate an interaction between two phylogenetically conserved behaviors, and suggest that previous sleep experiences strongly modulate aggression with consequences for reproductive fitness."

However, a clear effect of sleep deprivation on aggressive behaviors remains unclear. We find that acute sleep deprivation profoundly suppresses aggressive behaviors in the fruit fly, while other social behaviors are unaffected. This suppression is recovered following post-deprivation sleep rebound, and occurs regardless of the approach to achieve sleep loss. Genetic and pharmacologic approaches suggest octopamine signaling transmits changes in aggression upon sleep deprivation, and reduced aggression places sleep-deprived flies at a competitive disadvantage for obtaining a reproductive partner. These findings demonstrate an interaction between two phylogenetically conserved behaviors, and suggest that previous sleep experiences strongly modulate aggression with consequences for reproductive fitness."

Furthermore, sleep-deprived male flies were less successful at mating with female flies when they were in direct competition with a rested male fly.

In addition, sleep disruptions influence emotional processing and can modulate affective state (<a href=\"#bib7\">Banks and Dinges, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Minkel et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2012</a>). Work over many decades has suggested an interaction between sleep loss and changes in aggressive behaviors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kamphuis et al., 2012</a>), but even basic questions such as directionality of effect remain unresolved. Chronic enforced wakefulness or selective REM sleep deprivation have been linked to increased aggression in rodents, although in both cases it is not possible to distinguish the potential effect of sleep loss from prolonged physical activity and/or increased stress (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kamphuis et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, work in humans indicates that while measures of irritability increase with insufficient sleep, aggression itself is unaffected or reduced (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kamphuis et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cote et al., 2013</a>). While human aggression often carries a negative connotation, it can provide a competitive advantage and thereby promote survival. However, dysregulated aggression and violence are significant public health concerns (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anderson, 2012</a>), as is chronic sleep insufficiency (<a href=\"#bib15\">Czeisler, 2013</a>), emphasizing the need to understand how these two processes affect one another."

Flies also exhibit sleep-like states (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hendricks et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Shaw et al., 2000</a>) and, in response to sleep deprivation, demonstrate deficits in behaviors like learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib32\">Seugnet et al., 2008</a>). Whether sleep and aggression interact in the fly is unknown. Monoamines such as octopamine (<a href=\"#bib14\">Crocker et al., 2010</a>), which is the insect analog of norepinephrine, and dopamine are potent regulators of arousal in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Andretic et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kume et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lebestky et al., 2009</a>). Distinct subpopulations of neurons of each type appear to independently modulate sleep and aggression. For octopamine, ASM neurons in the medial protocerebrum govern wake-promoting effects (<a href=\"#bib14\">Crocker et al., 2010</a>), while VUM cells in the anterior or posterior brain control social behavioral choice (<a href=\"#bib9\">Certel et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2007</a>) or fighting behaviors (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>), respectively. Regarding dopamine, neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body control sleep (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ueno et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wu et al., 2012</a>), and a number of distinct clusters modulate aggression, including PPM3 and T1 neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alekseyenko et al., 2013</a>). In sum, both of these signaling systems would be well positioned to integrate information regarding internal state and environmental demand to optimize behavioral output at a given time. Sleep serves numerous vital functions, but aggression is also a critical behavior for acquisition of food, reproduction, and predator defense (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anderson, 2012</a>). Disrupting sleep processes might impair the function of neuronal controls underlying aggression."

Reduced aggression occurs with different forms of sleep deprivation and is reversible with sufficient recovery sleep. Pharmacologic experiments reveal that an octopamine agonist specifically restores aggression in sleep-deprived flies, and we use genetic approaches to suggest that sleep loss itself, rather than manipulation of aggression neurons, is required for changes to aggression. Finally, we demonstrate that sleep deprived flies are at a disadvantage for reproductive success when competing against flies whose sleep has been unperturbed."

Flies were acutely sleep deprived for 12 hr overnight using mechanical stimulation, and aggression assays were performed the following morning, either by pairing flies within the same condition or pairing one control fly with a sleep-deprived fly (\u2018between conditions\u2019, for which males of each condition were tracked with a small dot of paint on the thorax). We found that acute sleep deprivation resulted in a profound suppression of aggression in both cases (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). In assays between deprived and non-deprived flies, non-deprived flies showed frequent lunges and were nearly always dominant over deprived flies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In contrast, flies that were sleep deprived overnight rarely lunged, even when attacked by a non-deprived fly, suggesting suppression of reactive aggression by sleep deprivation. In assays between 2 sleep-deprived flies, the males engaged in aggressive behaviors significantly less often than pairs of control flies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1, 2</a>). The reduced aggression within condition did not simply derive from lack of social encounters, as sleep-deprived and control pairs spent similar amounts of time interacting during the beginning of the assay (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); sleep-deprived flies could also be observed throughout the assay in close proximity without engaging in fighting behaviors, which rarely occurred in control flies. When lunging did occur, the latency to first lunge in pairs of sleep-deprived flies following initial social encounter was markedly increased compared to control flies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), and dominance was rarely established. Together, these results suggest deficits in both proactive and reactive aggression, and demonstrate that sleep deprivation negatively impacts fighting behaviors."

The CS males used in our experiments show high sleep amounts during both day (450.77 \u00b1 77.09 min) and night (528.91 \u00b1 109.74 min; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), allowing us to test day and night sleep requirements. Mechanical sleep deprivation for 11 hr during the day with fighting assays performed during the final hour of the light period also reduced aggression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and shifted dominance towards non-deprived flies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating that timing of sleep loss to day or night is not critical. How much sleep loss is required to affect subsequent fighting behaviors? We mechanically sleep deprived flies for the final 1, 3, or 6 hr(s) of the night, followed by aggression assays the next morning. Focusing on assays within condition, we found that 6 hr of sleep loss resulted in suppression of fighting (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) similar to 12 hr of sleep loss. However, sleep deprivation for the final 1 or 3 hr(s) of the night caused no reduction in fighting behavior (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), consistent with the timeframe of sleep loss required for learning deficits in flies (<a href=\"#bib32\">Seugnet et al., 2008</a>). To control for the possibility that mechanical stimulation/fatigue and not sleep loss per se is responsible for reduced aggression, we mechanically stimulated flies for a 6 hr period spanning the final 3 hr of night and first 3 hr of day. During this time, flies exhibit more wake in comparison to the final 6 hr of the night, only losing \u223c3 hr of sleep (sleep lost = 186.72 \u00b1 61.03 in night/day transition; sleep during final 6 hr of night = 293.41 \u00b1 61.49). Continuous stimulation for 6 hr during the night/day transition period did not affect subsequent fighting (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), indicating that sleep deprivation and not mechanical stimulation is responsible for suppression of aggression."

Fighting returned to baseline levels with 1 day recovery after sleep loss (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and dominance was equally likely for a previously sleep-deprived or non-deprived fly when paired against one another (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Thus, neither sleep deprivation, nor the mechanical stimulation used to deprive, result in injury to the fly or long-lasting impairment. Next, we further investigated the timeframe for recovery following 12 hr of mechanical sleep deprivation. Deprived or control flies were assessed within condition at 1, 3, 6, or 9 hr after overnight sleep deprivation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Following 1 and 3 hr of recovery sleep, aggression was still markedly suppressed. By 6 hr we observed recovery of fighting behaviors, with lunge counts no longer significantly reduced compared to the 6 hr control group. 9 hr after the end of sleep deprivation, levels of aggression remained indistinguishable from controls. Consistent with previous work (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hoyer et al., 2008</a>), we detected no differences in baseline aggression in control groups throughout the day (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)."

We noted sleep in CS males to be exquisitely sensitive to high temperatures, with near total sleep loss when exposed to 31\u00b0C overnight. Temperature-dependent sleep deprivation also resulted in reduced lunging with aggression assays performed the following morning at 25\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), indicating that suppressed aggression is not specific to mechanical sleep deprivation. To examine whether sleep deprivation in the fly indiscriminately impairs other complex motor programs, we tested if courtship between a socially naive male and virgin female is affected. Consistent with previous work (<a href=\"#bib31\">Seugnet et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kayser et al., 2014</a>), 12 hr of mechanical sleep deprivation during the night had no effect on courtship behavior the following morning as measured by courtship index or copulation frequency over a 10 min period (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Thus, a distinct complex behavior remains intact following acute sleep loss, suggesting that like learning and memory, aggression is a specific behavior that is impaired following sleep deprivation."

We examined whether either of these monoamines play a role in coupling sleep deprivation to changes in aggression. First, we asked how thermogenetic sleep deprivation via overnight activation of octopaminergic or dopaminergic neurons affects next day fighting. The <i>Drosophila</i> thermosensitive cation channel <i>dTrpA1</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hamada et al., 2008</a>) was expressed using <i>Tdc2-GAL4</i> (octopamine neurons) or <i>TH-GAL4</i> (dopamine neurons), and flies were exposed to 29\u00b0C for 12 hr overnight. Activation of neurons using either GAL4 line resulted in near total sleep deprivation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); importantly, overnight exposure to 29\u00b0C in flies lacking either the GAL4 or UAS did not impact sleep (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), in contrast to CS males exposed to 31\u00b0C. Aggression was assessed the following morning at 23\u00b0C, below the threshold for TrpA1 activation. Sleep deprivation by activation of Tdc2+ or TH+ neurons caused a significant suppression of aggression the following day (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>), while genetic and temperature controls with normal prior sleep showed no such effect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Our results suggest that perturbation of octopamine and/or dopamine signaling as a result of sleep deprivation could impair aggressive behaviors. Using a pharmacologic approach we tested whether octopamine or dopamine agonists rescue reduced aggression. Flies were fed the octopamine agonist chlordimeform (CDM) or the dopamine agonist L-DOPA leading up to aggression assays that were preceded by thermogenetic sleep deprivation. CDM, but not L-DOPA, rescued aggression following sleep deprivation via activation of Tdc2+ neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Surprisingly, CDM also rescued aggression following sleep deprivation via activation of TH+ neurons, while L-DOPA did not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This effect is not specific to thermogenetic sleep deprivation, as CDM alone rescued aggression after mechanical sleep deprivation as well (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results suggest that aggression-relevant octopamine function is compromised downstream of sleep deprivation signals, regardless of method of sleep loss."

Previous work has shown that social experience through group housing of flies also dramatically reduces aggression (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>), and we examined if a shared mechanism suppresses fighting in both cases. In contrast to sleep deprivation, reduced aggression secondary to group housing was similarly rescued either by CDM or L-DOPA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), indicating that the drugs can function comparably to rescue aggression depending on the method of suppression.

These neurons can be targeted genetically using <i>Tdc2-GAL4</i> with the <i>Cha-GAL80</i> suppressor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>). Suppressed aggression following overnight activation of all Tdc2+ neurons with TrpA1 might be independent of sleep deprivation, and derive from hyperstimulation and subsequent quiescence of the Tdc2+ Cha- aggression cells. To rule out this possibility, we activated these neurons for 12 hr overnight at 29\u00b0C, followed by next day aggression assays at 23\u00b0C. Activation of Tdc2+ Cha- neurons did not cause sleep deprivation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), consistent with research localizing the wake-promoting octopamine neurons to dorsal brain regions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Crocker et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, sustained activation of Tdc2+ Cha- neurons also did not impair aggression the following day (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Together these results show that reduced aggression following overnight activation of Tdc2+ neurons is not caused by hyperstimulation of Tdc2+ Cha- neurons, and further suggest that sleep deprivation per se is required for suppression of aggression."

A distinct subpopulation of VUM octopamine neurons that co-express the male variant of the sex determination factor Fruitless (Fru(M)) in the anterior SOG have been implicated in this behavioral choice (<a href=\"#bib9\">Certel et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2007</a>). We assessed whether sleep deprivation might influence social behavior decision-making in addition to aggression itself. Either 2 sleep-deprived or 2 control male CS flies (4\u20137 days old; reared in isolation) were placed with a virgin CS female, and we determined percent time spent courting the female in comparison to the other male. Previous work has shown that disturbing the function of Tdc2+ Fru(M)+ neurons results in abnormal elevation of male\u2013male courtship, whereas near exclusive male-female courtship with intermale aggression is found under normal conditions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Certel et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2007</a>). Following mechanical sleep deprivation overnight, we found that flies overwhelmingly courted females, with no difference in the minimal time engaged in male\u2013male courtship compared to pairs of non-deprived control males (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>).

Non-deprived flies were frequently observed to interrupt courtship activities of the other male, and at times, engage in fighting behaviors away from the female altogether. These behaviors were less frequently observed between sleep-deprived males. To quantify the reduced male\u2013male competition for a female mate in sleep-deprived flies, we determined the percent of time that the 2 males and 1 female were observed clustered together or in a \u2018chain\u2019 formation, with both males actively courting the female concurrently. During these periods, males were clearly observed to engage in low intensity fighting behaviors like fencing, which sometimes escalated to brief high intensity tussling or lunging. We found that in non-deprived flies, 26% of time in the assay was spent in chains or clusters; this was reduced to 17.2% in pairs of sleep-deprived males (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3, 4</a>), suggesting that competitive social interactions are reduced following sleep deprivation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that while social behavioral choice is unaffected, impairments in aggression influence how males competitively court a female."

Does reduced aggression following sleep deprivation have a functional consequence on reproductive fitness in a competitive environment? We paired control and mechanically sleep-deprived CS males together with a virgin female and assayed copulation success. Males of each condition were tracked with a dot of paint on the thorax. In these assays, we found that control flies were more likely to \u2018win\u2019 copulation with the female compared to sleep deprived flies (\u223c63% vs 37%; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Thermogenetic sleep deprivation via activation of Tdc2+ neurons overnight similarly impaired next-day performance in the competitive copulation assay against a genetically identical male (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). We then tested whether competitive copulation deficits can be reversed with rescue of aggression after sleep deprivation. <i>Tdc2-GAL4&gt;UAS-TrpA1</i> males were fed CDM or L-DOPA and sleep deprived overnight by exposure to 29\u00b0C. Competitive copulation assays were performed the following morning at 23\u00b0C against non-deprived <i>Tdc2-GAL4&gt;UAS-TrpA1</i> males that received no drug. Consistent with rescue of aggressive behaviors, we found that CDM restored copulation success of sleep-deprived males competing against controls, while L-DOPA had no effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Neither drug had a significant effect in assays against controls (no drug) in the absence of sleep manipulations (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that suppression of aggression following sleep loss is deleterious when competing with a non-deprived male for a reproductive partner."

The suppression of aggression is independent of the method used to induce sleep loss and reversible with sufficient recovery sleep. We provide evidence that octopamine plays a role in mediating reduced aggression levels following sleep loss, and we find using competitive courtship assays that sleep deprivation places flies at a disadvantage for reproductive success due to insufficient aggression towards competing males.

While there are well-validated measures of aggression as a lifetime personality trait, tools to measure changes to aggression in humans over relatively short-time periods (hours to days) are less well-established, as is measuring irritability in animal models independent of overt behavioral expression. Most human studies of the interaction between sleep and aggression have been correlational and utilized self-reported measures (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kamphuis et al., 2012</a>). Nonetheless, more recent human work is informative regarding dissociation of irritability and/or impulsivity from aggression itself: research supports a reduced capacity to inhibit impulsivity to negative stimuli after sleep deprivation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anderson and Platten, 2011</a>), while a study designed to measure reactive aggression in sleep-deprived men reported diminished aggression in response to provocation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cote et al., 2013</a>). The rodent literature supports the contrasting hypothesis that sleep insufficiency leads to <i>increased</i> aggression (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kamphuis et al., 2012</a>). These differences might result from confounds such as the impact of sustained activity or stress rather than sleep deprivation per se, or REM sleep loss vs total sleep loss. Regardless, while the repertoire of emotional experience and output in humans is far more complex than in a laboratory animal, the central effect of sleep deprivation on aggression appears to be conserved between flies and humans."

Using multiple types of sleep deprivation stimuli combined with genetic manipulations, our data suggest that the impact of sleep deprivation on aggression is causally related to sleep loss. Nonetheless, experimental paradigms that prevent sleep in the face of heightened sleep need are inherently stressful to an animal. The specificity with which aggressive social interactions are impaired as opposed to all social behaviors serves as a strong indicator that the effects we observe are not simply part of a broader stress response; moreover, other stressors are known to negatively impact courtship behaviors (<a href=\"#bib29\">Patton and Krebs, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Christie et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that courtship is not uniquely immune to stress-related impairment."

Male flies fight more in the presence of a female, and recent work has shown that prior exposure to a female suppresses this effect (<a href=\"#bib38\">Yuan et al., 2014</a>); the aforementioned study focused on aggressive behaviors occurring after male flies copulate with females in the arena, suggesting that aggression may function both to obtain a reproductive partner and possibly guard that partner after mating (<a href=\"#bib38\">Yuan et al., 2014</a>). Our data indicate that even in the setting of sleep deprivation, male flies will successfully court a female partner in the absence of competition. However, when competing for a female mate against a non-deprived control male, sleep deprivation impairs sexual fitness, likely due to reduced aggression towards the other male: pharmacologic restoration of aggression with an octopamine agonist likewise rescues sexual fitness. Importantly, reduced performance in the competitive copulation assay occurs in males that were isolated since eclosion, eliminating the possibility that previously-established hierarchical cues are involved and emphasizing the crucial role of sleep for normal function."

How is sleep need conveyed to aggression loci? Our results implicate octopaminergic signaling in this process, and suggest that neurons involved in setting aggression levels, but not male choice between courtship and aggressive behaviors, are specifically impacted: while intermale aggression is reduced with sleep deprivation, intermale courtship is not, by default, increased. Norepinephrine, the mammalian analog of insect octopamine, has a critical role in aggression in vertebrates; noradrenergic neurons are also important regulators of sleep-wake transitions. Identification of specific cellular subpopulations whose output is altered by sleep deprivation in <i>Drosophila</i> will enable mapping the neural circuits that relay sleep information to aggression centers, as well as investigation of the molecular signals that control deprivation-dependent changes to octopamine aggression neurons. The conserved cellular substrates of these behaviors between flies and mammals suggest such findings will be of relevance to understanding the neurobiological basis of aggression and impairment after sleep loss. In sum, our results indicate that two innate behaviors\u2014sleep and aggression\u2014are coupled, and suggest that molecular signals generated by sleep deprivation might be potential targets for selective modification of aggressive behaviors."

Aggression assays were performed and scored as previously described (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Certel and Kravitz, 2012</a>) with minor modifications. Assays consisted of fights between 2 males in 1 well of a 12 well plate with a food cup in the center. Yeast paste or a buried headless female were placed in the center of the cup, which was well lit. The sides of each arena were coated in Fluon (Bioquip Products, Rancho Dominguez, CA) and lid with Rain-X (ITW Global Brands, Houston, TX). Fights were recorded from above using a video camera (Sony HDR-CX210) and lunges scored manually, blind to condition. For fights between conditions (and all competitive copulation experiments) male flies were labeled with a small dot of acrylic paint at least 24 hr prior to the assay; the paint color for each condition was randomized between experiments. Lunge count for \u2018between condition\u2019 assays (control vs SD) was quantified separately for each fly of the designated condition; lunge count \u2018within condition\u2019 was quantified as the combined number of lunges from both flies in the assay. Dominance (scored only in \u2018between condition\u2019 assays) was determined as repeated lunges by one fly followed by retreat of the other to the edge of the cup or off the cup altogether (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alekseyenko et al., 2014</a>). All assays were performed for 30 min at 25\u00b0C and 40\u201360% humidity unless otherwise specified. For <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, social interaction was defined as time spent with the flies within 1 body length of one another. Interaction was quantified during the first 5 min of the assay or until first lunge, whichever occurred first. For pharmacologic rescue experiments, flies were fed chlordimeform (CDM; 0.05 mg/ml; Sigma) or L-DOPA (3 mg/ml; R&amp;D; Systems) mixed into 5% sucrose and 2% agar beginning \u223c4 hr prior to lights off, and continued to feed on the drug throughout the night (during 12 hr of thermogenetic sleep deprivation or mechanical sleep deprivation during the final 6 hr of night). At ZT0 (end of sleep deprivation), flies recovered for 1 hr on drug/control mixed into regular food at the same concentration prior to aggression assays at ZT1. For group-housing experiments, males were raised in groups of 10 flies for 4\u20135 days, then isolated on drug/control for 20 hr prior to assay at ZT1."

The mammalian literature has both human studies and rodent studies, but no clear consensus for the relationship has emerged \u2013 different studies report increased, unchanged or decreased aggression. Potentially the roles of stress and context may explain some of this variability, but examining the question in flies where there are relatively robust and standardized conditions to assess both is an opportunity to shed light on how sleep deprivation might affect aggression and the mechanisms that underlie the linkage. This paper provides a clear result suggesting that sleep deprivation decreases aggression without disrupting other complex behaviors."

In both instances, a single experiment with a small number of flies was used to generate the sleep plot; not all flies from each independent experiment that generates the lunging data are represented in these sleep traces. Both of those particular sleep plots come from experiments run at nearly the same time. While we agree it looks as though there are regular oscillations, we have confirmed by environmental monitors that temperature, humidity, and light are constant. It is possible that incubator fan noise or vibration contributed to that pattern. However, we now present new sleep plots from experiments run at a different time that make clear there are no ultradian rhythms in our experiments. These sleep experiments are from flies that yield the same effect on aggression as the noisier plots previously displayed."
