However, we lack a quantitative and systemic understanding of how the career transitions into assistant professor positions of PhD scientists from underrepresented minority (URM) and well-represented (WR) racial/ethnic backgrounds compare. Between 1980 and 2013, the number of PhD graduates from URM backgrounds increased by a factor of 9.3, compared with a 2.6-fold increase in the number of PhD graduates from WR groups. However, the number of scientists from URM backgrounds hired as assistant professors in medical school basic science departments was not related to the number of potential candidates (R<sup>2</sup>=0.12, p&gt;0.07), whereas there was a strong correlation between these two numbers for scientists from WR backgrounds (R<sup>2</sup>=0.48, p&lt;0.0001). We built and validated a conceptual system dynamics model based on these data that explained 79% of the variance in the hiring of assistant professors and posited no hiring discrimination. Simulations show that, given current transition rates of scientists from URM backgrounds to faculty positions, faculty diversity would not increase significantly through the year 2080 even in the context of an exponential growth in the population of PhD graduates from URM backgrounds, or significant increases in the number of faculty positions.

The vast majority of NIH funding\u2014approximately 83%\u2014is awarded to investigators at extramural institutions, many of whom serve as faculty members at academic and research institutions (<a href=\"#bib26\">Johnson, 2013</a>). In particular, MD-granting medical schools and their affiliates (henceforth, medical schools) that belong to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) receive 67% of NIH extramural funding, and comprised the entire top 20 of NIH-funded institutions in FY2015 (<a href=\"#bib40\">National Institutes of Health, 2016</a>).

Educational disparities between students from URM and WR backgrounds begin early in life, and accumulate from K-12 through early independence (<a href=\"#bib38\">National Institutes of Health, 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Garrison, 2013</a>). Thus, it is possible that the cumulative impact of these disparities is the URM PhD and postdoctoral talent pool that is too small to sustain meaningful levels of faculty diversity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Garrison et al., 2009</a>). If so, intervention strategies would need to focus primarily on building the talent pool."

Following the doubling of the NIH budget\u00a0between 1998\u00a0and\u00a02003, there was a significant increase in the number of PhDs awarded, without commensurate increase in the number of faculty positions (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stephan, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alberts et al., 2014</a>). This led to labor market imbalances in which there are significantly more scientists who desire faculty positions than the supply of such positions. Further, it is estimated that fewer than 11% of all life science PhDs enter faculty positions in any institution type (<a href=\"#bib42\">National\u00a0Science\u00a0Board, 2014</a>). This raises the possibility that the low number of faculty from URM groups is mainly a function of broader stresses on the faculty job market or changes in the overall labor market for PhDs (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zolas et al., 2015</a>). If so, intervention strategies could focus on expanding the number of new faculty positions available, thus creating more opportunities for scientists from all backgrounds."

Moreover, at PhD completion URM men and women report lower levels of interest in faculty positions at research-intensive universities than their WR counterparts, even when controlling for career interests at PhD entry, scholarly productivity, mentorship or research self-efficacy (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gibbs et al., 2014</a>). Thus, part of the lack of representation could be due to disproportionately low application rates by URM PhD graduates and postdocs for these positions for reasons ranging from values misalignment (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gibbs et al., 2013</a>), implicit and explicit biases (<a href=\"#bib5\">Colon Ramos and Qui\u00f1ones-Hinojosa, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jarvis, 2015</a>), or perceptions of hypercompetition within academic research that makes the positions particularly unattractive in the current funding climate (<a href=\"#bib30\">McDowell et al., 2014</a>)."

A fraction of the total stock of PhD graduates pursues faculty positions, and thus become candidates on the market. Candidates on the market are composed primarily of the subset of postdoctoral scientists pursuing faculty careers in medical school basic science departments but can include those who have non-traditional career paths such as the rare PhD student who proceeds directly to the faculty job market. Each year, candidates on the market are hired into the stock of assistant professors at a rate equal to the total number of slots available (\u201cslots available\u201d), and candidates who are not hired remain in the pool conditional on hiring probability (\u201cmarket dropout\u201d). After six years, assistant professors leave the system (either via promotion or contract termination, \u201cAssistant Professor Tenure or Leave\u201d). Boxes represent stocks (quantities), hourglasses represent flows (rates; writing italicized), variables are bolded, blue arrows represent causal connections between factors, and clouds represent system boundaries (<b>B</b>) Intermediate conceptual model. The pool of PhD graduates is separated into two groups: those who will pursue and enter faculty positions in research-intensive environments (\u201cFaculty Aspire\u201d), and those who will pursue other career interests (\u201cOther Aspire\u201d). All \u201cFaculty Aspire\u201d graduates enter the academic job market (\u201cCandidates on the Market\u201d) and remain based on hiring probability, while the \u201cOther Aspire\u201d scientists depart the system. As the total number of PhD graduates grows (\u201cBaseline PhD Graduate Growth Rate\u201d), the populations of \u201cFaculty Aspire\u201d and \u201cOther Aspire\u201d graduates are expected to grow equally (i.e. they maintain the same, fixed proportions with respect to one another). Initial populations (P<sub>0</sub>) of \u201cFaculty Aspire\u201d and \u201cOther Aspire\u201d candidates represent scaling factors that, together with the baseline growth rate, produce the number of PhD graduates in each stock. Candidates on the market are hired into the stock of assistant professors at a rate equal to the total number of slots available, and then depart the system six years later. (<b>C</b>) Elaborated model of faculty hiring for PhD scientists from WR and URM backgrounds with intervention to enhance workforce diversity. The career pathways of URM and WR scientists are conceptualized as independent, but are linked with respect to assistant professor hiring by the number of assistant professor slots available. URM and WR candidates are hired based on the number of slots available, and in proportion to their representation on the market (hence the influence of WR candidates on the URM hiring rate and vice versa). That is, the model posits no bias in hiring. In addition to baseline growth, the variable \u201cURM Target Growth Rate\u201d represents efforts from the scientific community to enhance workforce diversity. These additional URM scientists are initially added to the \u201cURM other aspire\u201d stock. The \u201ctransition rate\u201d represents the percentage of URM other aspire scientists that enter the faculty market. As this rate increases, more URM candidates enter the academic job market. Candidates hired leave the system after six years, and the initial populations (P<sub>0</sub>) are derived from empirical data as described in methods."

Despite this progress, there was no statistical linkage between the size of the pool of URM talent, and the number of URM assistant professors hired in basic science departments of medical schools (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; imputed values assuming 6-year turnover in assistant professor population; findings hold for longer periods of turnover). These findings suggest a decoupling of PhD production and faculty attainment in these environments for scientists from URM backgrounds. In contrast, WR assistant professor hiring numbers were more closely related to the total number of WR PhD graduates. Therefore, broader changes in the biomedical academic labor market\u2014i.e., more trainees than faculty positions, elongated pathways to independence, and declining research funding (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alberts et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">McDowell et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Larson and Ghaffarzadegan, 2014</a>)\u2013are insufficient to explain differences in faculty attainment between postdoctoral scientists from URM and WR backgrounds."

Systematic data on the applications, evaluations, offers and acceptances for assistant professor candidates in any academic discipline are not typically made available (due to privacy and confidentiality laws), thus we were unable to include this information in the model. However, a recent study has shown that inequality and hierarchy characterize assistant professor hiring across disciplines, and that prestige of doctoral institution plays a major role in who is hired (<a href=\"#bib4\">Clauset et al., 2015</a>). While 80% of Black and Hispanic science PhD graduates obtain their degrees from Carnegie classification research universities (high or very high research activity), this number is lower than the proportion of White and Asian PhD graduates from these institutions (90%) (<a href=\"#bib44\">National Science Foundation, 2015b</a>). Thus, it is possible that part of the difference can be attributed to the nature of the assistant professor hiring process itself, which emphasizes training background. A more in-depth analysis of this aspect of faculty hiring the biomedical sciences remains a topic for future work."

Thus, faculty diversity efforts that rely primarily on enhancing rates of PhD graduates (i.e. \u201cfilling the pipeline\u201d) can only have their desired impact if they are coupled with efforts to get these candidates on the market and hired.

On average, the pool of assistant professors turns over every six years. The analysis presented here demonstrated that in recent years, assistant professor hiring has been relatively stable at around 1000 positions each year (or roughly 7 assistant professors per institution across all basic science departments annually). Thus, to achieve parity with the pool of PhD graduates (estimated to grow to 10% URM in 2016) would require hiring around 100 URM assistant professors annually at medical schools. Put another way, if roughly two-thirds of medical schools hired (and retained) just one faculty member from an URM background annually for the next six years, the system would reach parity with the PhD pool within one tenure cycle. While this would still not reflect the proportion of people from URM backgrounds in the overall population (currently greater than 30%), this would represent a meaningful first step to addressing the longstanding goal of enhancing scientific excellence by increasing faculty diversity."

For example, if there are 100 slots available, and 25% of the candidates on the market are from URM backgrounds and 75% are from WR backgrounds, then 25 slots will be filled by URMs and 75 slots will be filled by WRs. Although the career development pathways for WR and URM students are separate, the total number of assistant professor slots available links them. If there are not enough candidates to fill all slots, these slots are removed from the system. Specifically, we posit that candidates in a specific group (URM or WR) are hired with likelihood proportional to their representation on the market. That is, the model posits no hiring bias."

This growth rate increases exponentially throughout the duration of the model, matching the empirical trend of URM biomedical PhD population growth from 1980-2013. The \u201cURM target growth rate\u201d is conceptualized as the result of external intervention; thus, these additional URM scientists are initially added to the \u201cURM other aspire\u201d stock. For model simulations, the overall number of scientists in the \u201cURM other aspire\u201d stock is the greater of either the baseline growth rate, or the URM target growth rate. A proportion of URM PhD graduates who begin in the \u201cother aspire\u201d stock may then choose to pursue a faculty career. The \u201ctransition rate\u201d is a free parameter that represents the proportion of URM \"other aspire\" graduates that choose to pursue faculty careers Because there has not been similar intervention to increase the number of scientists from WR backgrounds entering the PhD pool and faculty market, they do not have a transition rate. Thus, the total number of URM candidates on the market is equal to the number who would have entered the market in proportion to the overall growth of the system (i.e. \"URM Faculty Aspire\"), and the number who entered as a result of external intervention and then chose to pursue faculty careers (i.e. \u201cURM Other Aspire\u201d scientists who transition) minus those who have dropped out of the market (\"URM Market Dropout\")."

The value of \u201cURM Faculty Aspire P<sub>0</sub>\u201d is 34.4, and \u201cWR Faculty Aspire P<sub>0</sub>\u201d is 567.7. The growth rates for each population (UR or WR) were then scaled to match empirical trends, resulting in numbers of PhD graduates. The patterns of growth differed between scientists from WR and URM backgrounds (piecewise linear and exponential respectively). Thus, for scientists from WR backgrounds, we used the difference between the 1980 population of PhD graduates and \u201cWR Faculty Aspire\u201d candidates to calculate the \u201cWR other aspire P<sub>0</sub>.\u201d For URM scientists, we fit an exponential function to URM student growth data and used the associated coefficient to derive the \u201cURM other aspire P<sub>0</sub>\u201d."

Specifically, we made the simplifying assumption that there were a fixed number of slots available per year (i.e., flat hiring), with a step increase in 1998, when the NIH budget-doubling lead to an era of expansion in the biomedical sciences. Thus, the numbers of slots available from 1980-1997 (n=602.1 slots), and 1998-2013 (n=1064.7 slots) represent the average number of total assistant professors hired during these periods.

                                "text": "There are a number of limitations to the analyses presented. Postdoctoral training has become an almost uniform prerequisite to obtaining a faculty position in biomedical research. There are no reliable estimates on the number of postdocs in the US (currently or historically), thus these data were not included in the model (<a href=\"#bib34\">National Academy of Sciences NAoE, and Institute of Medicine, 2014</a>). However, available data suggest comparable postdoctoral transition rates across race/ethnicity for PhD graduates (<a href=\"#bib44\">National Science Foundation, 2015b</a>). Further, we recognize that scientists from URM and WR groups are not all uniform (i.e. there are differences across race/ethnicity groups, and between them by dimensions including but not limited to socioeconomic background). However, the small numbers of scientists from any individual URM group on the faculty did not allow for further disaggregation and separate modeling of URM populations. Additionally, some scientists (from all racial-ethnic backgrounds) complete their training outside of the U.S., and then obtain faculty positions within the U.S. For example, a Black or Hispanic scientist who completed their training outside of the U.S., and then obtained a faculty position within the U.S. would be counted as a URM faculty member, even though they were not part of the URM PhD pool (which only includes U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents who completed their training within the U.S.). There are no systematic data available on the numbers of scientists from either WR or URM racial-ethnic backgrounds who fit this category (<a href=\"#bib37\">National Institutes of Health, 2012a</a>), thus these data were not included in the model. From the perspective of examining the transition from PhD to assistant professor in medical school basic science departments, a central focus of this work, the entry of scientists that identify as being part of an URM group into faculty positions but who were not trained in the U.S. would lead to an overestimation of the proportion of URM PhD graduates hired as assistant professors. Finally, between the period of 1980-2013, many universities adopted policies that allow for flexibility in the traditional six-year tenure clock (<a href=\"#bib2\">American Association of University Professors, 2004</a>). Thus, our assumption of a fixed, six-year tenure clock may also lead to an overestimation of the number of assistant professors hired each year, but it is consistent with the standard timeframe used by number of leading institutions (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stanford University, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yale School of Medicine, 2014</a>)."

URM might be weaker in the market or be discriminated. From a modeling standpoint, your model has two degrees of freedom, if you assume there is no \"weight\" toward hiring WR relative to URM, you end up with much higher \"WR Faculty Aspire P0\" anyway. I think the best way, but difficult, is to provide some references for this argument (that there is less faculty aspiration among URM). The easier way is to clarify that you are aware of this assumption and discuss its implications in your policy recommendation. You may need to modify your language throughout the paper too."
