                    "text": "The mammalian circadian clock is driven by a transcriptional\u2013translational feedback loop, which produces robust 24-hr rhythms. Proper oscillation of the clock depends on the complex formation and periodic turnover of the Period and Cryptochrome proteins, which together inhibit their own transcriptional activator complex, CLOCK-BMAL1. We determined the crystal structure of the CRY-binding domain (CBD) of PER2 in complex with CRY2 at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution. PER2-CBD adopts a highly extended conformation, embracing CRY2 with a sinuous binding mode. Its N-terminal end tucks into CRY adjacent to a large pocket critical for CLOCK-BMAL1 binding, while its C-terminal half flanks the CRY2 C-terminal helix and sterically hinders the recognition of CRY2 by the FBXL3 ubiquitin ligase. Unexpectedly, a strictly conserved intermolecular zinc finger, whose integrity is important for clock rhythmicity, further stabilizes the complex. Our structure-guided analyses show that these interspersed CRY-interacting regions represent multiple functional modules of PERs at the CRY-binding interface."

Proper oscillation of the clock depends on the complex formation and periodic turnover of the Period and Cryptochrome proteins, which together inhibit their own transcriptional activator complex, CLOCK-BMAL1. We determined the crystal structure of the CRY-binding domain (CBD) of PER2 in complex with CRY2 at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution. PER2-CBD adopts a highly extended conformation, embracing CRY2 with a sinuous binding mode. Its N-terminal end tucks into CRY adjacent to a large pocket critical for CLOCK-BMAL1 binding, while its C-terminal half flanks the CRY2 C-terminal helix and sterically hinders the recognition of CRY2 by the FBXL3 ubiquitin ligase. Unexpectedly, a strictly conserved intermolecular zinc finger, whose integrity is important for clock rhythmicity, further stabilizes the complex. Our structure-guided analyses show that these interspersed CRY-interacting regions represent multiple functional modules of PERs at the CRY-binding interface."

This endogenous clockwork prepares an organism for periodic environmental fluctuations and coordinates numerous physiological and behavioral processes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Reppert and Weaver, 2002</a>). At the molecular level, the mammalian circadian clock operates through an auto-regulatory transcription\u2013translation feedback loop composed of four core components\u2014the transcriptional activator proteins, CLOCK and BMAL1, and the transcriptional repressors, Periods (PERs) and Cryptochromes (CRYs). The heterodimeric CLOCK and BMAL1 complex acts as the positive arm of the loop by recognizing E-box elements and promoting the expression of clock-controlled genes, including <i>Per1</i>, <i>Per2</i>, <i>Cry1</i>, and <i>Cry2</i>. The PER and CRY proteins function as the negative arm of the loop by blocking the activity of CLOCK-BMAL1 and inhibiting the transcription of their own and all other clock-controlled genes. The cyclic accumulation, localization, and degradation of the PER and CRY proteins are necessary to manifest a 24-hr rhythm (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2011</a>)."

Independent of PERs, overexpressed CRY1 and CRY2 can each potently inhibit the CLOCK-BMAL1-induced transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Griffin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kume et al., 1999</a>). This transcriptional repression activity of CRYs likely occurs through their direct interactions with BMAL1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Griffin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Shearman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Partch et al., 2014</a>) and CLOCK (<a href=\"#bib12\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Despite the important repressor function of CRYs, the PER proteins have been suggested as the rate-limiting factor of the rhythmic negative feedback loop (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lee et al., 2001</a>). With its protein abundance tightly regulated during the circadian cycle, PERs mediate the formation of the PER-CRY complexes and their nuclear localization. Once in the nucleus, PERs might physically bridge CRYs and CLOCK-BMAL1 and promote their interactions (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2009</a>). The critical role of PERs in driving the molecular clock is underscored by the complete loss of circadian rhythmicity upon constitutive overexpression of PERs, but not CRY1, in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">McCarthy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ye et al., 2011</a>)."

The F-box proteins, \u03b2-TrCP and FBXL3, have been discovered as the key ubiquitin ligases, responsible for promoting the polyubiquitination of PERs and CRYs, respectively (<a href=\"#bib25\">Shirogane et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Busino et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Godinho et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Reischl et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Siepka et al., 2007</a>). Phosphorylation of a degron sequence serves as the signal for PER ubiquitination by \u03b2-TrCP (<a href=\"#bib25\">Shirogane et al., 2005</a>), whereas recognition of CRYs by FBXL3 is made through a large protein-interaction interface without the involvement of a canonical degron motif or any post-translational modification (<a href=\"#bib31\">Xing et al., 2013</a>). This CRY-FBXL3 interface is susceptible to disruption by both the CRY cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and the PER proteins, which have been suggested to control the stability of CRYs by directly competing with FBXL3 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Xing et al., 2013</a>)."

The PER2\u2013CRY1 interaction was only abolished when alanine mutations were simultaneously introduced to two adjacent stretches of residues in the C-terminal, but not N-terminal half of PER2-CBD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

The PER2-CBD \u03b13 helix preceding this loop packs against the long CRY2 C-terminal helix at an approximately 30\u00b0 angle, while the region C-terminal to the loop locks onto the same CRY2 helix from the other side (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>). Together, these PER2-CBD structural elements encircle the CRY2 C-terminal helix like an U-shaped clamp. Arg501 and Lys503 in the CRY2 C-terminal helix have previously been documented to be important for PER2 binding (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ozber et al., 2010</a>). In the crystal, these two positively charged residues of CRY2 project in opposite directions and latch onto the surrounding PER2 regions by forming salt bridges with Asp1167 and Asp1206, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To confirm the critical role of the CRY2 C-terminal helix in binding PERs, we mutated two hydrophobic residues, Ile505 and Tyr506, at the end of this CRY2 helix, which are involved in fixing the \u03b1-helix to the rest of the CRY2 \u03b1-helical domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). As expected, mutating both residues to aspartate completely abolished the PER2-binding activity of CRY2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The same effect was also achieved when negative charges were introduced to the side chains of a stretch of four nearby residues (amino acids 1171\u20131174) in the \u03b13 helix of PER2-CBD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

In the crystal structure of the FBXL3-CRY2 complex, the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of FBXL3 engages CRY2 at the same site as PER2-CBD does in the PER2-CRY2 complex. The interface between FBXL3-LRR and CRY2 is also centered around the long C-terminal helix of the Cryptochrome protein. In fact, the CRY2 surface regions involved in contacting FBXL3-LRR and PER2-CBD share extensive overlapping regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Superposition analysis reveals that FBXL3 and PER2 cannot be simultaneously engaged with CRY2 without clashing into each other (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). PERs, therefore, have the capability of protecting CRYs from FBXL3-mediated ubiquitination and degradation by directly competing with the ubiquitin ligase for binding CRYs."

Together, these four residues sequester a strong density at the center, hinting at the coordination of a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion at the end of the PER2\u2013CRY2 interface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Indeed, we were able to validate the identity of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion by both anomalous dispersion measurements and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Although a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion has been previously reported to mediate protein\u2013protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Somers et al., 1994</a>), to our knowledge, this is the first CCCH-type intermolecular zinc finger that has been identified in a protein complex. Interestingly, the electron density of the PER2 sequence preceding the CXXC motif is not as strong as other regions of PER2-CBD, suggesting that the intermolecular zinc finger might have evolved to stabilize a flexible region of the PER\u2013CRY interaction by acting as a \u2018molecular clasp\u2019."

By contrast, the \u2018IY\u2019 mutant of CRY1, which confers severe structural disruption in the C-terminal helix, failed to restore any level of circadian rhythm, although it has the ability to repress CLOCK-BMAL1 as seen by the constitutively low luciferase signal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Because the C-terminal helix of CRYs is a critical region for binding both FBXL3 and PERs, this result underscores the importance of CRY ubiquitination and degradation in establishing clock rhythmicity and suggests the ability of CRY1 to inhibit CLOCK-BMAL1 in a PER-independent manner. In agreement, two CRY1 mutants unable to coordinate zinc, C414A and H473A, were also capable of transcriptional repression, even though their PER-binding activities are largely compromised (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>)."

This single amino acid mutation highlights the key role of the secondary pocket of CRYs for repression. Intriguingly, double serine to aspartate mutations (S44D S45D) in the nearby serine loop at the opposite side of the CRY secondary pocket completely rescued the circadian rhythm, although the period of the bioluminescence rhythms rescued by the mutant was reliably shorter than the wild-type CRY1 by about 1 hr (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). In our co-immunoprecipitation experiments, this double serine mutation weakened PER2 binding to a lesser degree than the zinc finger mutations, which did not elicit a similar period-shortening effect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Therefore, the period-shortening effect induced by the double serine mutation is likely specific to the defects of the local PER\u2013CRY interface instead of their overall binding. It is conceivable that PERs might engage with CRYs near the CLOCK-BMAL1 docking site to control a periodicity-related step of negative feedback different from what they do at the predominant PER\u2013CRY interface."

To fulfill this role, PERs have been suggested to act through multiple mechanisms, including mediating CRY nuclear entry, coupling CRYs to CLOCK-BMAL1, and competing with FBXL3 to stabilize CRYs. Our structural and mutagenic analyses of the PER2-CBD-CRY2 complex reveal a surprisingly robust binary assembly, which is resilient to mutational disruption. This stable complex is enabled by an extended binding mode of PER2-CBD, which spreads several distinct functional modules over a mostly linear interface. The hallmark of the PER\u2013CRY interactions is its steric incompatibility with the FBXL3\u2013CRY complex, which provides the structural basis for the competition of PERs and the FBXL3 ubiquitin ligase for controlling CRY stability. Interestingly, distant from the FBXL3\u2013CRY interface, PERs also anchor themselves next to the putative CLOCK-BMAL1-binding pocket of CRYs, possibly regulating a specific step of transcriptional repression. Despite intensive genetic and cell-based studies, the precise spatial and temporal steps undertaken by PERs to coordinate transcriptional repression in the molecular clockwork remain unclear. On the one hand, PERs have been reported to be essential for CRYs to interact with CLOCK-BMAL1 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2009</a>). On the other hand, emerging evidence suggests that PERs binding might interfere with complex formation between CRYs and CLOCK-BMAL1 at certain steps during repression (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ye et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akashi et al., 2014</a>). Conceivably, by interacting with the CRY C-terminal helix, PERs could compete with the C-terminus of the BMAL1 transactivation domain for CRY binding (<a href=\"#bib7\">Czarna et al., 2011</a>). While detailed biochemical studies are necessary to resolve this controversy, our results offer the structural framework for in-depth mechanistic investigations."

Together, these structures outline a rich landscape for the functional surfaces of mammalian CRYs, which distinguishes them from other members of the cryptochrome/photolyase superfamily. In their C-terminal \u03b1-helical domain, CRYs feature the conserved FAD-binding pocket, which is also targeted by the FBXL3 C-terminal tail and the clock-modulating drug, KL001. In their N-terminal \u03b1/\u03b2 photolyase domain, CRYs have evolved the secondary pocket into a critical site for CLOCK-BMAL1 binding. Importantly, both CRY surface pockets are demarcated by structural elements with noticeable structural plasticity (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>). The FAD-binding pocket is framed by the phosphate-binding loop and the interface loop on opposite edges, whereas the secondary pocket is guarded by the serine loop on one side. With the exception of the phosphate-binding loop, both the interface and serine loop have been shown to directly mediate protein\u2013protein interactions. Lastly, the extreme C-terminal \u03b1-helix of the mammalian CRYs presents yet another important surface area, which is responsible for the mutually exclusive binding of FBXL3 and PERs. Remarkably, all these molecular interacting sites likely represent an incomplete functional map of CRYs. Numerous mutants identified in our random mutagenesis screen of functionally deficient CRY1 and CRY2 bear mutations of amino acids located outside these sites (<a href=\"#bib17\">McCarthy et al., 2009</a>). Future structural studies are needed to paint a complete picture of CRY functional surfaces."

The major structural difference lies at the interface of the N-terminal region of PER2-CBD and the CRY secondary pocket. The CRY1-bound PER2-CBD fragment contains a residual fusion-protein sequence, which forms an artifactual \u00df-hairpin with the first five amino acids of the PER2-CBD (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Diffraction-quality crystals were subjected to a cryo-protectant procedure by gradually increasing the concentration of ethylene glycol to 25% (vol/vol) and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. The native and zinc anomalous data sets were collected at the BL8.2.1 beamline at the Advanced Light Source of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Reflection data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the HKL2000 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Otwinowski and Minor, 1997</a>). The CRY2-PER2 complex was determined by molecular replacement using CRY2 from the murine CRY2-KL001 complex structure (PDB:4MLP) as the search model. The structural models were manually built, refined, and rebuilt with the programs COOT (<a href=\"#bib8\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>), PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>), and CCP4 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Winn et al., 2011</a>). PER2 was built in following density modification. All figures were made using PyMOL (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC). Buried surface area was calculated using CNS (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brunger et al., 1998</a>)."

To date, the mechanistic roles of these two repressor proteins have remained largely unclear. Recently, several studies suggested that the molecular clock machinery relies on a sophisticated spatio-temporal complex assembly between CRY, PER and CLOCK:BMAL1. In this paper, the authors solved the crystal structure of mCRY2 (1-512) in complex with an mPER2 CRY-binding domain (CBD 1095-1215). Based on the structure information and mutagenesis analysis, the authors concluded that: (1) The N terminal of CBD is anchored at the edge of CRY secondary pocket that might be critical for the interactions with CLOCK:BMAL1, thus supporting the biochemical analysis of the clock protein interactions during the repressive phase of the TTFL. (2) Binding of PER2 to CRY interferes the interactions between FBXL3 and CRY. (3) A intermolecular Zinc finger motif stabilizes the CRY:PER complex. The paper is of good quality. The detailed interactions described between CRY and PER provide valuable information for future study to elucidate the molecular clock machinery."
