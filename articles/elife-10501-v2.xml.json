It is unknown how the collective output of neoblasts transit through differentiation pathways to produce specific cell types. The planarian epidermis is a simple tissue that undergoes rapid turnover. We found that as epidermal progeny differentiate, they progress through multiple spatiotemporal transition states with distinct gene expression profiles. We also identified a conserved early growth response family transcription factor, <i>egr-5</i>, that is essential for epidermal differentiation. Disruption of epidermal integrity by <i>egr-5</i> RNAi triggers a global stress response that induces the proliferation of neoblasts and the concomitant expansion of not only epidermal, but also multiple progenitor cell populations. Our results further establish the planarian epidermis as a novel paradigm to uncover the molecular mechanisms regulating ASC specification in vivo."

It is unknown how the collective output of neoblasts transit through differentiation pathways to produce specific cell types. The planarian epidermis is a simple tissue that undergoes rapid turnover. We found that as epidermal progeny differentiate, they progress through multiple spatiotemporal transition states with distinct gene expression profiles. We also identified a conserved early growth response family transcription factor, <i>egr-5</i>, that is essential for epidermal differentiation. Disruption of epidermal integrity by <i>egr-5</i> RNAi triggers a global stress response that induces the proliferation of neoblasts and the concomitant expansion of not only epidermal, but also multiple progenitor cell populations. Our results further establish the planarian epidermis as a novel paradigm to uncover the molecular mechanisms regulating ASC specification in vivo."

The precise coordination of stem cell proliferation and proper fate specification is of paramount importance to tissue growth and organismal homeostasis. Excessive stem cell divisions can lead to tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib65\">Visvader and Lindeman, 2012</a>), while a loss in proliferation capacity can contribute to premature aging (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gopinath and Rando, 2008</a>).

Previous studies have shown that the chromatin-remodeling factor <i>chd4</i> and the tumor suppressor gene <i>p53</i>, both expressed in the neoblast compartment, are required for tissue homeostasis and regeneration (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pearson and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Scimone et al., 2010</a>). Both <i>chd4</i> and <i>p53</i> are also expressed in <i>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </i> cells. <i>Chd4</i> is expressed broadly throughout the animal parenchyma as well as in the brain and ventral nerve cords, and <i>p53</i> is expressed in discrete mesenchymal cells that also include <i>smedwi-1<sup>+</sup> </i> and <i>prog-1<sup>+</sup> </i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). RNAi knockdown of both <i>chd4</i> and <i>p53</i> results in a dramatic loss of <i>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, it is not well understood whether these mechanisms of action are direct or indirect. Based on their close proximity to the basement membrane and on post-irradiation kinetics, <i>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </i> cells likely represent a relatively stable transition at which multiple fate decisions could be made. Therefore, we reasoned that the union of <i>chd4</i> and <i>p53</i> RNAi whole-worm RNA-seq down-regulated datasets would contain genes enriched in <i>AGAT-1</i><sup>+</sup> cells, as well as genes with enriched expression in epidermal cell populations that arise from <i>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </i> progeny cells, potentially revealing critical factors required for post-mitotic differentiation."

Irradiation is a powerful tool that has been demonstrated to rapidly and specifically eliminate neoblasts, and subsequently, their immediate progeny cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</a>). The <i>prog-1<sup>+</sup> </i> and <i>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </i> cell populations were identified based on their spatial expression domains and down-regulation kinetics after irradiation. That is, the temporal order of <i>prog-1</i> (early) and <i>AGAT-1</i> (late) down-regulation correlates with the spatial distribution of these markers: the more peripheral the location of the cell, the longer the marker persists after irradiation. We were intrigued by a potential relationship between <i>zpuf-6</i> and <i>vim-3</i>, also identified in our screen (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), because it is expressed in fewer sub-epidermal mesenchymal cells that do not overlap with <i>AGAT-1</i>, but more epidermal cells than <i>zpuf-6</i>.

We therefore focused on characterizing putative transcription factors from our common down-regulated gene set as likely candidates important for post-mitotic epidermal differentiation. <i>egr-5</i> is a planarian homolog of the early growth response (<i>EGR1</i>) family of C2H2-type zinc-finger TFs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <i>EGR1</i> genes are known to be induced by extracellular signals including growth factors, hormones and neurotransmitters, and couple these signals to long-term responses by altering the expression of target genes (<a href=\"#bib61\">Thiel and Cibelli, 2002</a>). <i>Egr-5</i> is expressed in discrete mesenchymal cells located throughout the animal in a spatial pattern similar to <i>AGAT-1</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We examined <i>egr-5</i> expression levels in greater detail by whole-mount FISH in combination with other post-mitotic markers of the epidermal lineage. Robust <i>egr-5</i> expression appears to correlate with strong <i>AGAT-1</i> expression, but <i>egr-5</i> is also lowly expressed in <i>AGAT-1<sup>neg</sup> zpuf-6<sup>+</sup> </i> mesenchymal cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, top panel). By whole-mount FISH metrics, <i>egr-5</i> expression is also barely detectable in a subset of <i>prog-1<sup>+</sup> </i>cells and in the epidermis (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, bottom panels), demonstrating that <i>egr-5</i> expression, although varied in signal intensity, spans the domain of all post-mitotic lineage markers. In addition, <i>egr-5</i> transcripts are predominantly found in the FACS-dissociated Xins population comprised of post-mitotic cells and not in the X1 neoblast dividing fraction (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), further suggesting that <i>egr-5</i> mainly functions in post-mitotic cells."

We observed a significant reduction in <i>zpuf-6</i> expression (see more below) in the epidermis between day 12 and day 24 of RNAi treatment, whereas <i>rootletin</i> expression did not diminish, although it appeared disorganized compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B</a>). Analysis of the ventral cilia by SEM qualitatively showed similar levels in abundance. However, the ventral epidermal cells in <i>egr-5</i>(RNAi) animals appeared more smooth and stretched out and lacked epidermal pores/pits as seen in control animals (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). The smoothness of the ventral epidermis also contributed to difficulty in delineating individual epidermal cells. Our data suggest that the reduced epidermal density in <i>egr-5</i>(RNAi) animals could be caused by the failure of new epidermal progeny cells to properly differentiate and incorporate into the epidermis, resulting in stretching and apparent morphological defects. Consistent with this hypothesis, we also found that there was a significant reduction in the number of <i>laminB</i><sup>+</sup> cells in the anterior region of <i>egr-5</i>(RNAi) animals compared to control animals after 21 days of RNAi treatment (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

In RNAi conditions such as <i>chd4, p53</i> and <i>zfp-1</i> knockdown where <i>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </i> cell populations are lost, there is a distinct progressive disappearance in the spatial distribution of cells, but the signal intensity of the gene marker expressed in the remaining cells is not significantly diminished (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). This suggests that these factors are required for the generation or maintenance of <i>AGAT-1<sup>+</sup> </i> cells, but not necessarily required for the expression of <i>AGAT-1</i> or other markers in these cells. However, a TF can be responsible for the expression of <i>AGAT-1</i> or some other marker, and not be required for the maintenance of that cell type, or both. To distinguish between the loss of cell type versus the loss of specific gene expression, we made RNA probe mixes consisting of multiple <i>zpuf</i> genes from our screen expressed in either <i>AGAT-1</i> or <i>zpuf-6</i> cells to increase overall signal intensity and detection."

We then simultaneously analyzed <i>prog-1, AGAT-1</i> and <i>zpuf-6</i> markers by whole-mount FISH and established that in <i>egr-5</i>(RNAi) animals, epidermal progeny cells in the mesenchyme are not specifically lost, but that <i>AGAT-1</i> and <i>zpuf-6</i> expression levels were significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>). Although <i>zpuf-6</i> mesenchymal expression is very weak after <i>egr-5</i> knockdown, it is virtually undetectable in the epidermis, potentially highlighting a key transitional defect. Given that <i>egr-5</i> knockdown reduces both epidermal cell density as well as the expression of <i>AGAT-1</i> and <i>zpuf-6</i> markers, we suggest that <i>egr-5</i> is responsible for both the maturation of epidermal progeny cells and the expression of progeny markers. Interestingly, <i>prog-1</i> and <i>AGAT-1</i> normally do not exhibit significant overlapping expression domains, but here they display significant overlapping expression patterns after loss of <i>egr-5</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, left panels). Together, our results demonstrate an essential role for <i>egr-5</i> in the proper spatial and temporal progression of progeny cells in the epidermal lineage and that misexpression of these marker domains likely causes improper differentiation and failed epidermal maturation."

We picked a time point where H3P levels were high in <i>egr-5</i>(RNAi) animals (before the decline) and then analyzed the proportion of dividing progenitors for major tissues, including the epidermis (zeta-class) (<a href=\"#bib63\">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>), protonephridia (<i>pou2/3</i>) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Scimone et al., 2011</a>), gut (<i>hnf4</i>) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wagner et al., 2011</a>) and brain (<i>pax6A</i>) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wenemoser et al., 2012</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013G</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

These results suggest that <i>egr-5</i> RNAi knockdown causes an overall expansion of multiple lineage progenitors, including the epidermal progenitors (zeta-class). Therefore, failure to generate mature epidermal cells in <i>egr-5</i>(RNAi) animals is not caused by a failure to generate zeta-class epidermal progenitors. Rather, it is likely caused by a defect at the post-mitotic differentiation level.

Based on general morphology and the observation that <i>egr-5</i> RNAi animals did not exhibit defects in osmoregulation by bloating, we conclude that the protonephridia are functional. The strong increase in <i>p53</i> expression builds upon our previous finding that loss of <i>egr-5</i> increases the number of zeta-class epidermal progenitors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), as well as <i>prog-1</i> and <i>AGAT-1</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a>). The enriched gut expression marked by <i>hnf4</i> in <i>egr-5</i>(RNAi) animals also suggests the presence of an increased number of gut cells, without any discernible physiological consequences (<i>e.g.</i>, animals can still eat).

Given that dorsal and ventral epidermal cells are morphologically distinct, positional cues and signals are likely to contribute to the cell fate specification process. For example, transplantation experiments involving a plug of tissue from a donor transplanted in the reverse dorsal-ventral (DV) orientation with regard to the host can trigger tissue outgrowths on both sides where the grafted tissue maintains its original DV identity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kato et al., 1999</a>). The sub-epidermal layer of body wall muscle cells express most of the polarity cues that organize the planarian body axes, including receptors, ligands and inhibitors of the BMP and Wnt signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib71\">Witchley et al., 2013</a>), and could potentially impact epidermal fates as well. The role of Notch signaling has not been well characterized in planarians but has been implicated in the regulation of cell fate determination in epithelial cells of the mouse intestine (<a href=\"#bib64\">VanDussen et al., 2012</a>) and the lung (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rock et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Rock and Hogan, 2011</a>).

Additionally, there could be other progenitors (zeta-class dependent or independent) that give rise to specific epidermal cell types that have not been defined molecularly. To build upon our understanding of epidermal cell fate specification, it will be necessary to define all the types and numbers of cells that ultimately compose both the ventral and dorsal planarian epidermis, as well as the factors that contribute to their identity and maintenance."

It will be interesting to investigate the neoblast response in other RNAi or pharmacological contexts that directly affect epidermal integrity to determine how these perturbations affect neoblast function. However, it still remains possible that neoblast expansion could be a response to the global increase in apoptosis, although we still do not understand how the processes of cell proliferation and cell death are integrated. Alternatively, <i>egr-5</i> may be responsible for the expression of a signaling molecule to which neoblasts respond in a feedback control process. Feedback signaling from differentiating progeny to neoblasts may be an important and robust strategy to control stem cell activity during homeostasis and regeneration. Therefore, unveiling the downstream targets of <i>egr-5</i> will help discern these possibilities, as well as provide more mechanistic insight on the role of <i>egr-5</i> and the progression of epidermal fate maturation."

Do neoblast progeny contribute to the dynamics of the microenvironment, thereby playing a niche-like role? How are cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms coupled for the maintenance of cellular equilibrium at the organismal level? How is the overall physiological status of the animal sensed, integrated and converted to the appropriate neoblast output? With a more nuanced understanding of their adaptive behavior, planarian neoblasts and the epidermal lineage have emerged as an important model system in which to study the dynamics between stem cell self-renewal and the orchestration of progeny differentiation."
