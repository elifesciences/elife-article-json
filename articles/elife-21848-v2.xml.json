                    "text": "The second messenger c-di-GMP (or cyclic diguanylate) regulates biofilm formation, a physiological adaptation process in bacteria, via a widely conserved signaling node comprising a prototypical transmembrane receptor for c-di-GMP, LapD, and a cognate periplasmic protease, LapG. Previously, we reported a structure-function study of a soluble LapD\u2022LapG complex, which established conformational changes in the receptor that lead to c-di-GMP-dependent protease recruitment (Chatterjee et al., 2014). This work also revealed a basal affinity of c-di-GMP-unbound receptor for LapG, the relevance of which remained enigmatic. Here, we elucidate the structural basis of coincidence detection that relies on both c-di-GMP and LapG binding to LapD for receptor activation. The data indicate that high-affinity for LapG relies on the formation of a receptor dimer-of-dimers, rather than a simple conformational change within dimeric LapD. The proposed mechanism provides a rationale of how external proteins can regulate receptor function and may also apply to c-di-GMP-metabolizing enzymes that are akin to LapD."

This matrix protects bacteria from hostile environments, rendering them more resistant to insult and, in the context of pathogenic microbes, more\u00a0tolerant to antibiotics and the immune system. The transition between planktonic and sessile lifestyles is tightly regulated, typically involving the second messenger c-di-GMP (or cyclic diguanylate) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hengge, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hengge et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">R\u00f6mling et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wolfe and Visick, 2008</a>). The cellular c-di-GMP level is governed by two enzyme classes with opposing activities: GGDEF domain-containing diguanylate cyclases and EAL or HD-GYP domain-containing phosphodiesterases, which synthesize and degrade the dinucleotide, respectively (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schirmer and Jenal, 2009</a>). A wide variety of specific, c-di-GMP-binding receptors translate the second messenger signal into physiological responses (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chou and Galperin, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sondermann et al., 2012</a>). Bacterial genomes can encode a large number of c-di-GMP-signaling proteins and this number scales roughly with the organism\u2019s adaptivity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Galperin, 2005</a>). A particularly interesting observation is that, despite identical catalytic activities, c-di-GMP-metabolizing enzymes often confer distinct signaling outcomes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dahlstrom et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ha et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kulasakara et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lindenberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Newell et al., 2011a</a>). The mechanisms underlying this apparent signaling specificity are not well understood."

                        "text": "Recent work by our lab and others have focused on a conserved signaling system comprising the Lap operon that controls cell adhesion and biofilm formation in gammaproteobacteria, including <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chatterjee et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib46\">Newell et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">2011b</a>), <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cooley et al., 2016</a> <a href=\"#bib56\">Rybtke et al., 2015</a>), <i>P. putida</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gjermansen et al., 2010</a>), <i>Bordetella bronchiseptica</i> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ambrosis et al., 2016</a>), and <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i> (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). At its center, the inner membrane protein LapD functions as a receptor with degenerate GGDEF and EAL domains, which together relay intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations to the periplasm. At high c-di-GMP levels, LapD sequesters the adhesin protein-specific, periplasmic protease LapG at the inner membrane via the receptor\u2019s periplasmic domain. This step ensures that large adhesin proteins whose transcription is activated by the dinucleotide remain stably associated with the outer cell membrane. When c-di-GMP levels drop and adhesin expression ceases, LapD undergoes a conformational change, adopting an autoinhibited state with low affinity for LapG; freed LapG, in turn, processes the adhesin proteolytically, weakening cell adhesion and ultimately contributing to biofilm dispersal (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chatterjee et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Newell et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cooley et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rybtke et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Borlee et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mart\u00ednez-Gil et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Monds et al., 2007</a>). Notably, our previous work identified a transient, yet detectable interaction of LapG with c-di-GMP-unbound LapD, suggesting that the protease may participate in an early event of LapD signaling (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chatterjee et al., 2014</a>). Curiously, saturation binding of LapG to LapD was markedly lower in the absence of c-di-GMP compared to levels when both ligands, c-di-GMP and LapG, were present. The functional relevance and mechanistic role of this interaction, however, remained poorly defined."

To further confirm a quantitative difference between c-di-GMP-bound and -unbound LapD with regard to LapG affinity, we developed a fluorescence anisotropy-based assay, which relies on LapG that is fluorescently labeled at the sole cysteine residue in the protein\u2019s active site (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Titration of purified, detergent-solubilized LapD to a fixed concentration of fluorescent LapG yielded saturation-binding data, revealing an approximately 6-fold increase in LapG\u2019s apparent affinity for LapD when c-di-GMP is present. Interestingly, the\u00a0LapD titrations used here reached comparable maximum binding with and without c-di-GMP (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), in contrast to our previous assays in which LapG was the titrant which\u00a0showed distinct maxima\u00a0for LapD\u2013LapG binding in the presence or\u00a0absence\u00a0of c-di-GMP (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chatterjee et al., 2014</a>).

To characterize these states further, we turned to cysteine crosslinking, a time-honored approach to assess the conformation and dynamics of proteins with high spatial resolution (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bass et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Butler and Falke, 1998</a>). In this approach, a covalent crosslink forms upon mild oxidation, catalyzed by copper phenanthroline (Cu(Phen)<sub>2</sub>), only when two cysteine residues are in close spatial proximity (~2\u20133 \u00c5). For visualization of crosslinked polypeptides in SDS-PAGE, we expressed LapD variants with a C-terminal monomeric superfolder-GFP (sfGFP) tag. Specific LapD\u2013sfGFP detection in crude solubilized membrane fractions is based on in-gel fluorescence, with crosslinks introducing electrophoretic mobility shifts of the sfGFP-fusion protein. Furthermore, we mutated two native cysteine residues in the soluble domains of LapD (C<sup>304</sup> and C<sup>397</sup>) to alanine and serine, respectively, to eliminate non-specific crosslinks. This LapD variant (\u2018TMcys\u2019) retained the two native cysteine residues in the transmembrane helices (C<sup>12</sup> and C<sup>158</sup>). Using a specific LapG photo-crosslinking assay (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chatterjee et al., 2014</a>), we showed that LapD-TMcys was able to bind LapG in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner similar to wild-type LapD, as was a variant lacking all four native cysteine residues (\u2018cysless\u2019) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

To distinguish between these two possibilities, we mixed LapD variants with distinct molecular weight, LapD\u2013sfGFP and non-fluorescent LapD, which separately form constitutive dimers in their respective apo-state (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). As seen before (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), oxidation of LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-A<sup>602</sup>C\u2013sfGFP in the presence of c-di-GMP and LapG produced a crosslinking band that migrates just below the 250 kDa marker (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; dark blue arrow).

Importantly, these specific crosslinking events occur readily with detergent-solubilized LapD at low protein concentration (~1 \u03bcM). Qualitatively similar results were obtained when proteins are embedded in a lipid bilayer of fused membrane fractions from cells separately expressing LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-A<sup>602</sup>C\u2013sfGFP or non-fluorescent LapD<sup>TMcys</sup> variants (see Material and Methods; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

The first two states were stably monodisperse after purification, and could be analyzed directly. The two c-di-GMP-containing states, however, contained minor peaks based on our SEC-MALS data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To avoid complications associated with such polydisperse samples and to\u00a0capitalize on the observation that the predominant species could be separated by gel filtration, these samples were injected into an in-line size-exclusion chromatography system mirroring our SEC-MALS experiments. Guinier analysis of these samples collected on the SEC-SAXS setup (<a href=\"#bib37\">Malaby et al., 2015</a>) revealed that\u00a0they were monodisperse, and were therefore suitable for further analysis. Interpretation of the SAXS data was facilitated by having experimentally determined crystallographic structures of isolated domains of LapD and\u00a0by the recently developed program MEMPROT,\u00a0which\u00a0models a detergent corona around transmembrane domains (<a href=\"#bib53\">P\u00e9rez and Koutsioubas, 2015</a>)."

In the present study, we uncovered structural events that ensure exquisite control of a bacterial biofilm signaling switch, the conserved second messenger receptor LapD, based on the characterization of the intact membrane protein. LapD sequesters and thus regulates its cognate periplasmic protease LapG in response to rising c-di-GMP levels in the cytosol, a mechanism that has been described as inside-out signaling\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib46\">Newell et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">2011b</a>). Yet, new evidence presented here indicates that\u00a0both ligands, c-di-GMP and LapG on either side of the inner bacterial membrane, contribute to the conformational switch that establishes a signaling competent state. The distinct response as a result of two independent inputs is a hallmark of coincidence detection, achieved here through bi-directional signaling across the membrane."

We show that a LapD dimer is already inherently asymmetric even in the absence of any ligands. One half-site of an apo-LapD dimer adopts a conformation akin to the crystal structure of the autoinhibited cytosolic module, characterized by an occluded c-di-GMP binding site (<a href=\"#bib44\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>). The other half-site appears to sample an open conformation, in which the EAL domain is disengaged from LapD\u2019s regulatory S helix. Such a conformation would prime LapD for c-di-GMP binding, which, in turn, would shift the equilibrium to the more extended state, thus preventing autoinhibition. The reason why one protomer appears more dynamic than the other is not well understood, but could indicate anti-cooperative effects in oligomeric receptors analogous to mechanisms described for other bacterial receptors (<a href=\"#bib36\">Maksay and T\u0151ke, 2014</a>). In support of this, we previously showed that only one equivalent of c-di-GMP is required per LapD dimer for maximal LapG binding, and that the high-affinity LapG-binding state of the periplasmic domain of LapD is asymmetric (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chatterjee et al., 2014</a>). Both of these features could manifest from the proposed anti-cooperative nature of activation."

By contrast, activation of the complex with c-di-GMP results in a disengaged EAL domain and\u00a0in more compact output domains that\u00a0are\u00a0competent to bind LapG more tightly.

This observation indicates a distinct signaling input into LapD via LapG. The simultaneous binding of c-di-GMP and LapG to LapD\u2019s cytosolic and periplasmic domains, respectively, establishes a conformation in which the EAL domains dimerize through a canonical interface (<a href=\"#bib44\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barends et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Minasov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sundriyal et al., 2014</a>). In contrast to previous models, this interaction does not occur within a dimer, but across two LapD dimers. This change in quaternary structure, the formation of a LapD dimer-of-dimers, is apparent in all three, independent approaches reported on here. An\u00a0exact molecular mechanism explaining this long-range allosteric regulation of LapD resulting in a higher oligomeric, high-affinity complex remains enigmatic, but\u00a0it appears that the HAMP domain functions as an integrator of bilateral signaling across the membrane.

Some parallels can be drawn to the YfiBNR system in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Malone et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2010</a>). YfiN is a transmembrane, GGDEF-domain-containing diguanylate cyclase with a juxtamembrane HAMP domain and a periplasmic PAS domain. The cyclase-inactive state is stabilized through interactions of YfiN\u2019s periplasmic domain with YfiR, a periplasmic protein. An environmental signaling cue, possibly cell wall or redox stress, leads to the dissociation of YfiR, which in turn increases YfiN\u2019s cyclase activity and \u2014 as a result \u2014 cellular c-di-GMP levels. While YfiN regulation probably relies on its integral HAMP domain and periplasmic ligand binding (<a href=\"#bib21\">Giardina et al., 2013</a>), direct juxtaposition with LapD\u2019s mechanism is hindered by a gap in our understanding regarding the structure of the full-length diguanylate cyclase."

It is possible that the underlying molecular mechanisms for the regulation of these proteins follows the paradigm that\u00a0we established here for LapD. Indeed, asymmetry, like\u00a0that we described for the LapD output domain-LapG complex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chatterjee et al., 2014</a>), is common among outside-in signaling membrane proteins, including HAMP domain-containing chemotaxis receptors and histidine kinases (<a href=\"#bib36\">Maksay and T\u0151ke, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Milburn et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Neiditch et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yeh et al., 1996</a>). For example, binding of the quorum-sensing signal AI-2 to the periplasmic domain of the histidine kinase complex LuxPQ induces asymmetry in its periplasmic domains (<a href=\"#bib45\">Neiditch et al., 2006</a>). Likewise, ligand-induced asymmetry in Tsr/Tar chemosensory receptors promotes the oligomerization of three identical, but functionally non-equivalent,\u00a0cytoplasmic core domains (<a href=\"#bib9\">Briegel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2012</a>).

Consistently, protein\u2013protein interactions between enzymes that make or break c-di-GMP and c-di-GMP-specific receptors have been implicated\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Abel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lindenberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Guzzo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ryan and Dow, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ryan et al., 2012</a>), including the GcbC diguanylate cyclase and the\u00a0LapD receptor pair (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dahlstrom et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2016</a>). Nevertheless, it was not entirely clear how these two membrane proteins might interact, as the motifs identified as\u00a0mediating the physical contacts are either buried or sterically not accessible in a simple LapD dimer model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our revised model,\u00a0based on the observation of asymmetric LapD dimers in the apo- and c-di-GMP-bound states, as well as the symmetric LapD dimer-of-dimers, reconciles this conundrum. These\u00a0dimers have in common an open configuration that could provide a signaling platform for heterologous interactions with other proteins such as GcbC (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Since apo-LapD samples the extended state, this model is also consistent with the observation that GcbC interacts with both apo- and constitutively active variants of LapD (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dahlstrom et al., 2015</a>). The structural impact of the GcbC\u2013LapD interaction on the c-di-GMP receptor remains to be assessed, but it is conceivable that GcbC could stabilize a LapD dimer-of-dimers and/or induce a conformation similar to that of the LapG\u2013c-di-GMP-bound receptor. Regardless, the fact that LapD can adopt these many different conformations allows it to present unique interfaces for direct interaction with other proteins for proper regulation. Such a mechanism for imparting strict specificity to an otherwise ubiquitous second messenger molecule has significant implications. The concepts of an open signaling platform, asymmetry as a vital feature for regulation, and coincidence detection could also be relevant for diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases that require exquisite control and trigger specific signals in the background of a larger c-di-GMP signaling network. Conceivably, interventional strategies could be devised to target specific c-di-GMP cyclases, phosphodiesterases or receptors, despite these proteins all having similar folds or catalytic activity. Hence, revealing the language of these signaling networks will be crucial for controlling and treating chronic infections caused by biofilm-forming pathogens."

For the LapD\u2022c-di-GMP\u2022LapG complex, samples were prepared identically, except that a 3-fold molar excess of LapG over LapD dimer was added prior to concentration.

SASREF was used to rotate and translate each individual domain to fit the scattering data, enforcing only restraints necessary to maintain contiguous peptide chains. The program MEMPROT was then used to generate and optimize a detergent micelle around the transmembrane domain of the resulting model. This model with the optimized MEMPROT-generated micelle was then re-run through SASREF in an identical manner to generate the final model for trapped-inactive LapD. For native, apo-LapD, the micelle generated from the trapped-inactive structure was used, and SASREF was run similarly except that the EAL domains of LapD were separated from their respective GGDEF domains to allow for flexibility. The identical procedure was performed for the LapD\u2022c-di-GMP complex.

This work is very well conducted and the manuscript is clearly written. I really don't see any further experimentation that is required. The fascinating part of this manuscript is that it shows the fluidity of all of these different states of LapD, and how this can fine tune and modify signal transduction."

Specifically, what is the affinity of LapG to LapD in the absence of c-di-GMP, and to what extent is this changed upon the addition of c-di-GMP? Measurements by isothermal titration calorimetry would be even more compelling, as these would allow highly quantitative measurement of binding stoichiometry."

It is based on observations of the oligomerization state of the full-length detergent-solubilized LapD in the presence/absence of c-di-GMP and LapG using three techniques: (1) SEC-MALS, (2) Cys-cross-linking and (3) SAXS. The authors provide strong evidence that in the presence of LapG and c-di-GMP, LapD forms asymmetric tetramers, in which tetramerization is mediated by two of the four EAL domains, one from each LapD dimer. This data is very exciting and intriguing, providing a new model regarding LapD activation. While the experimental work is largely sound, the current work would be enhanced by providing a more clear mechanism that explains how this asymmetric tetramer is stabilized by LapG/c-di-GMP, since this is not obvious from the data presented (nor discussed in detail)."

While we agree such analyses may provide additional proof of the sites of crosslinking, we do not consider it an essential control in light of all the data we included already."

At the resolution of SAXS-based modeling and the fact that purified LapD is a multi-domain, micelle-containing protein, some ambiguity in the data can be expected. The unaccounted for density in the tetramer model coincides with the transmembrane/micelle region, which is likely the area of highest ambiguity with regard to the accuracy of the modeling process. As a result of these careful considerations, we decided to include several approaches and focus our discussion on the consensus interpretation emerging from this cross-validation."
