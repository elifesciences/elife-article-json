We show that Aurora-A mediated H3 T118ph occurs at pericentromeres and chromosome arms during prophase and is lost upon chromosome alignment. Expression of H3 T118E or H3 T118I (a SIN mutation that bypasses the need for the ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler SWI/SNF) leads to mitotic problems including defects in spindle attachment, delayed cytokinesis, reduced chromatin packaging, cohesion loss, cohesin and condensin I loss in human cells. In agreement, overexpression of Aurora-A leads to increased H3 T118ph levels, causing cohesion loss, and reduced levels of cohesin and condensin I on chromatin. Normal levels of H3 T118ph are important because it is required for development in fruit flies. We propose that H3 T118ph alters the chromatin structure during specific phases of mitosis to promote timely condensin I and cohesin disassociation, which is essential for effective chromosome segregation."

We show that Aurora-A mediated H3 T118ph occurs at pericentromeres and chromosome arms during prophase and is lost upon chromosome alignment. Expression of H3 T118E or H3 T118I (a SIN mutation that bypasses the need for the ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler SWI/SNF) leads to mitotic problems including defects in spindle attachment, delayed cytokinesis, reduced chromatin packaging, cohesion loss, cohesin and condensin I loss in human cells. In agreement, overexpression of Aurora-A leads to increased H3 T118ph levels, causing cohesion loss, and reduced levels of cohesin and condensin I on chromatin. Normal levels of H3 T118ph are important because it is required for development in fruit flies. We propose that H3 T118ph alters the chromatin structure during specific phases of mitosis to promote timely condensin I and cohesin disassociation, which is essential for effective chromosome segregation."

This \u201cX\u201d shape is actually made up of two identical parts, or chromatids, that are joined together until a specific time during cell division.

Chromatin comprises arrays of nucleosomes, where each nucleosome has ~146 base pairs of DNA wrapped 1.75 times around a histone octamer composed of two molecules each of core histone H3, H4, H2A, and H2B (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kornberg, 1974</a>). Repetitive arrays of nucleosomes are then further compacted by higher-order folding, requiring additional proteins including linker histones. During mitosis, chromosome condensation plays a critical role in preventing DNA breaks during mitosis and enabling equal chromosome segregation to the two daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ganem and Pellman, 2012</a>)."

The PTMs, usually occurring on the N- and C-terminal tails of the histones, generally serve to recruit reader proteins to the chromatin. PTMs also occur on the histone globular domains, but are much less well studied than the histone tail modifications. PTMs at the histone-DNA interface have been proposed to directly modulate nucleosome structure, without the need for reader proteins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cosgrove et al., 2004</a>). Of all the histone PTMs that occur at the histone-DNA interface, one of the best positioned to disrupt the nucleosome structure is phosphorylation of threonine 118 (T118ph) of H3 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mersfelder and Parthun, 2006</a>). In agreement with its important location within the nucleosome structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), biochemical studies have confirmed that H3 T118ph causes reduced nucleosome stability, increased nucleosome mobility, and increased DNA accessibility (<a href=\"#bib36\">North et al., 2011</a>). Strikingly, H3 T118ph caused the formation of novel populations of alternate DNA-histone complexes that have DNA wrapped around two complete histone octamers arranged edge-to-edge, termed nucleosome duplexes and altosomes (<a href=\"#bib37\">North et al., 2014</a>). In agreement with the biochemical data, a substitution of H3 T118 for isoleucine (T118I) was identified in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> as a dominant <span class=\"underline\">Swi-IN</span>dependent (SIN) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kruger et al., 1995</a>). The SIN H3 T118I substitution allows nucleosomes to slide along the DNA without the need for SWI/SNF (<a href=\"#bib33\">Muthurajan et al., 2004</a>)."

Accordingly, we characterized H3 T118ph function in metazoan cells. H3 T118ph, mediated by Aurora-A, is localized to centromeres and chromosome arms during specific phases of mitosis, Mutation of H3 T118 caused a wealth of defects including lagging chromosomes, delayed cytokinesis, reduced cohesion and altered chromosome compaction in mammalian cells and inviability in <i>Drosophila</i>. Given that the H3 T118I mutant or overexpression of Aurora-A led to premature release of cohesin and condensin I from chromosomes, we propose that H3 T118ph alters chromosome structure during mitosis to help dissociate cohesion and condensin I."

Here we show only the results obtained with the Abcam antibody, although similar results were obtained with our independently generated H3 T118ph polyclonal antisera (data not shown). The antisera were highly specific in dot-blot assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and recognize a single protein identical in size to histone H3 in western blot analysis of total protein extracts from HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This signal in western blots was increased by treating the cells with the protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor calyculin A for 3\u2009hr, indicating that the H3 T118ph antibody recognized phosphorylated H3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In concordance with previously published mass spectrometry results (<a href=\"#bib38\">Olsen et al., 2010</a>), we observed a dramatic increase in H3 T118ph levels as cells entered mitosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The antibody also recognized H3 T118ph in its native conformation, because it immunoprecipitated H3 from cells released into mitosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Using immunofluorescence analysis, we found that H3 T118ph was restricted to mitotic cells during prophase through anaphase and was greatly diminished in interphase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Specifically, H3 T118ph signal was detected as discrete foci on chromatin only in prophase and pro-metaphase. Additionally, H3 T118ph co-localized with centrosomes through all phases of mitosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). This is a consequence of non-chromatin bound histones localizing to the centrosomes for proteasome-mediated degradation during mitosis (C. Wike and J.K. Tyler, manuscript submitted). During anaphase, the H3 T118ph antibodies also detected the spindle mid-body (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). The localization pattern of H3 T118ph was not unique to HeLa cells, nor cancer cell lines, because it was similar in HMEC, WI-38 and MCF10A cells (data not shown). Finally, the H3 T118ph signal was specifically competed away by an H3 T118ph peptide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Together, these results show that the H3 T118ph antibody is specific."

Therefore, we tested whether H3 T118 is phosphorylated in other metazoans and whether this occurs specifically during mitosis. In <i>D. melanogaster</i> S2 cells, H3 T118ph localized to chromatin and centrosomes during mitosis (data not shown). H3 T118ph localization was also conserved in <i>C. elegans</i>. During pro-metaphase, H3 T118ph was localized along the outside edges of chromosomes, indicative of centromeric localization on holocentric chromosomes in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To determine if the localization of H3 T118ph along the arms of chromosomes was dependent on the centromeric chromatin structure, we used siRNA to the centromeric histone variant CENP-A to abolish the centromeres. Upon CENP-A knockdown, H3 T118ph is diminished from the chromatin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). These data demonstrate that mitotic enrichment of H3 T118ph is conserved amongst metazoans. Furthermore, H3 T118ph localizes to centromeres and its localization is dependent on intact centromeres."

                                "text": "Given our results in <i>C. elegans</i>, we asked if the punctate chromosomal staining of H3 T118ph in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) reflects centromeric staining. Indeed, we found that H3 T118ph co-localized with CENP-A in human cells in prophase and pro-metaphase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Noteworthy, the prophase to metaphase timing of the appearance and disappearance of H3 T118ph on centromeres is distinct from other mitotic H3 phosphorylation events. For example, H3 S10ph (<a href=\"#bib7\">Crosio et al., 2002</a>) and H3 T3ph (<a href=\"#bib40\">Polioudaki et al., 2004</a>) remain on chromosome arms and centromeres, respectively, through anaphase. CENP-A S7ph (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zeitlin et al., 2001</a>) remains through metaphase, while H3 T118ph is lost from centromeres in metaphase coincident with chromosome alignment. H3 T118ph foci did not always perfectly colocalize with CENP-A, but sometimes appeared to be adjacent to CENP-A foci. Indeed, detailed inspection of mitotic spreads revealed that H3 T118ph localized to the inner centromere when cells were treated with the microtubule destabilizing drug colcemid while CENP-A remained on the outer-centromere (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The distinct localization of CENP-A and H3 T118ph emphasizes that the H3 T118ph signal is not due to phosphorylation of CENP-A per se. Importantly, upon colcemid treatment, where microtubule attachment is lost, the interkinetochore distance is decreased (<a href=\"#bib51\">Uchida et al., 2009</a>). The single foci that is detected by H3 T118ph antibody could be because of a single population of H3 T118ph localized to the inner-centromere or because the two adjacent centromeres are separated by less than the resolution of light microscopy, which is theoretically 200nm. Therefore we asked when there is dynamic microtubule attachment, promoting tension and kinetochore stretching, what is the true H3 T118ph signal at the centromere. H3 T118ph existed in two foci per chromosome that correlate well with, but are larger than, the two CENP-A foci (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) consistent with pericentromeric localization. We noted that H3 T118ph also appears to occur along the chromosome arms in mitotic spreads (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Indeed, H3 T118ph was detectable at the centromere partially overlapping with CENP-A and at weaker foci at discrete intervals along the chromosome arms on extended chromatin fibers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>)."

                                "text": "To gain insight into the function of H3 T118ph, we sought to identify the kinase responsible for its phosphorylation. We utilized a ProQinase kinase screen to test 190 recombinant kinases for their ability to phosphorylate H3 T118 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Aurora-A was the only cell cycle regulated kinase able to efficiently phosphorylate H3 T118 from among the three positive kinases, arbitrarily defined as having an activity above 3000 cpm. Absence of phosphorylation of H3 T118 by Aurora-B and Aurora-C further validated Aurora-A as the kinase of H3 T118 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We independently confirmed that Aurora-B INCENP could not phosphorylate the T118 peptide, including an H3 S10 peptide as a positive control (data not shown). Two different inhibitors to Aurora-A eradicated the H3 T118ph signal (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Upon Aurora-A knockdown, which eradicated most of the Aurora-A protein and activity (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), H3 T118ph was undetectable on chromatin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In agreement with Aurora-A being the <i>bona fide</i> H3 T118 kinase, knockdown of TPX2, a known activator of Aurora-A (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kufer et al., 2002</a>), greatly reduced H3 T118ph (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B,C</a>).

To do this, we mutated T118 to alanine to prevent its phosphorylation. This serves as a negative control that is not expected to yield a phenotype, because there is still phosphorylation of the endogenous H3. We also mutated T118 to glutamic acid (E), although this mutation does not cause the nucleosome destabilization or altered nucleosome structures that result from T118 phosphorylation in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib36\">North et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">North et al., 2014</a>). As such, T118E is not an effective mimic of T118 phosphorylation, at least on mononucleosomes in vitro. We also mutated H3 T118 to isoleucine (I) to recapitulate the yeast sin mutant. Transient transfection of HEK 293TR cells with plasmids expressing histone H3:YFP where T118 was mutated to E or I led to a significantly increased incidence of lagging chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Equal expression of the wild type and mutant H3 proteins was verified by western blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that cells expressing H3 T118E:YFP or H3 T118I:YFP had significant delays in cytokinesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>, see Materials and methods). Furthermore, whenever a lagging chromosome was evident, there also was an accompanying delay in the subsequent cytokinesis, regardless of the transfected construct (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). From these experiments, we conclude that expression of H3 T118I and T118E results in lagging chromosomes that delay cytokinesis."

This prompted us to investigate if phosphorylation of H3 T118 plays a role in correction of chromosome alignment errors, using an error correction assay (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lampson et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">Santaguida et al., 2010</a>). For this, we created a panel of stable 293TR cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged wild type H3, H3 T118E, T118I, or T118A from the same locus. All the H3:FLAG proteins were expressed to equivalent levels, at approximately 10% of the endogenous H3 level (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4D,E</a>) and all could be incorporated into chromatin (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). We further verified that the H3 T118 mutations in H3:FLAG did not cause a delay in prophase to anaphase (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>). The error correction assay was as follows: Monastrol was used to induce a monopolar spindle and kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The cell lines were able to recover by washing out Monastrol if proper checkpoints and machinery are in place and the chromosomes will attach to bipolar spindles. Additionally, cells were released in the presence of MG132 to allow time to align the chromosomes to the metaphase plate by preventing cells from entering anaphase. Importantly, the H3 T118 mutations did not delay release from the pro-metaphase arrest (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5C</a>). Expression of either H3 T118E or T118I significantly decreased the ability to align chromosomes compared to wild type H3 or T118A (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>). This result suggests that an over abundance of H3 T118E and T118I mutants may hinder chromosome congression."

Since cells expressing H3 T118I and T118E showed reduced chromosome congression, we asked if H3 T118ph remains at centromeres of misaligned chromosomes as the cells enter metaphase. Caffeine was used to induce misaligned chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Katsuki et al., 2008</a>). H3 T118ph remained at centromeres of misaligned chromosome along with the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) kinase BubRI, even in metaphase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This suggests that removal of H3 T118ph is triggered by chromosome alignment and led us to speculate that H3 T118ph plays a role in achieving efficient chromosome attachment. Accordingly, we investigated the potential molecular reasons for the defect in chromosome congression caused by H3 T118E and T118I. Outer-kinetochore proteins, spindle assembly checkpoint proteins and the heterochromatin landscape were indistinguishable between cells expressing H3 T118A, T118E, T118I or wild type H3 (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that misaligned chromosomes in H3 T118I and T118E mutants are capable of forming proper kinetochores and recruiting SAC proteins"

Mitotic spreads from cells expressing wild type H3 or H3 T118A upon pro-metaphase arrest (induced by Monastrol) and metaphase arrest (Monastrol arrest released into MG132) mostly had closely associated sister chromatids with 'closed' or 'open' arms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By contrast, H3 T118E or H3 T118I caused a higher incidence of chromosomes with \u201cpartially separated\u201d arms, indicating loss of arm cohesion and partial loss of centromeric cohesion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Similar defects in cohesion were observed for cells expressing T118E and T118I upon pro-metaphase arrest with the microtubule destabilizing drugs nocodazole and colcemid (data not shown). The loss of cohesion was most pronounced for H3 T118I, where partially separated sister chromatids were predominant in 50% of the cells versus 10% of the cells for wild type H3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Furthermore, the proportion of cells where most of the sister chromatids were totally separated, indicating complete loss of cohesion, was 16% for H3 T118I versus 4% for wild type H3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These data indicate that H3 T118E or H3 T118I promotes loss of cohesion at the centromere and chromosome arms. Given the correlation between faulty cohesion and chromosome alignment defects, we propose that the faulty cohesion caused by expression of H3 T118I or T118E is responsible for the defects in chromosome alignment."

Aurora-A overexpression has not been linked to cohesion loss previously, but this could provide an alternate explanation for aneuploidy. Therefore, we made isogenic cell lines overexpressing Aurora-A and kinase dead Aurora-A. The cell lines had equal expression of Aurora-A (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) and proceeded relatively normally through the cell cycle (data not shown). Overexpression of Aurora-A increased levels of H3 T118ph along the chromosome arms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We asked if overexpression of Aurora-A recapitulates the loss of cohesion caused by expression of H3 T118I and T118E. Upon colcemid-induced pro-metaphase arrest, overexpression of Aurora-A caused 44% of the sister chromatids to be \u201cpartially separated\u201d as compared to 20% for the control cell line (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Because overexpression of Aurora-A leads to cohesion loss, it is likely that cohesion loss in the H3 T118E and T118I mutants is due to their structurally mimicking elevated levels of H3 T118ph."

Upon pro-metaphase arrest, chromosomes from the H3 wild type and T118A mutant cell lines were organized into loops and coils to form very tight compact structures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). By contrast, mitotic chromosomes from the H3 T118E and T118I cell lines were less tightly packed with longer radiating DNA loops. These results indicate that H3 T118E and T118I disrupt the higher order chromatin packaging. This grossly altered mitotic chromosome structure led us to test whether the H3 T118I mutation causes the histones to be more readily removed from chromatin. In agreement, H3 T118I was more readily extracted from chromatin than wild type H3 at 600\u00a0mM salt (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Expression of H3 T118I also increased DNA accessibility to the nuclease DNase I in both asynchronous and mitotically arrested cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Together, these results are consistent with biochemical studies that showed that mononucleosomes with H3 T118ph favor the removal of histone H3 from DNA compared to unphosphorylated mononucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib36\">North et al., 2011</a>)."

Overexpression of Aurora-A also caused increased sister chromatid interkinetochore distances (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>).

During mitotic delay, the intensity of the Rad21/Scc1 component of the cohesion complex along chromosome arms and at centromeres was drastically reduced in cells expressing H3 T118E and T118I (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Mechanistically, the loss of cohesin and the resulting faulty cohesion phenotype that is caused by excess H3 T118ph (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C,E</a>) could result from multiple causes: premature activation of separase, premature removal of cohesion via cohesin phosphorylation, or improper establishment of cohesion. We set out to distinguish amongst these possibilities. To ask if cells expressing H3 T118I and T118E had premature activation of separase during mitotic delay, we analyzed mitotic spreads after incubation with MG132, which prevents degradation of Cyclin B and Securin and therefore inhibits separase activation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rock et al., 1994</a>). The fact that the T118I and T118E mutants still displayed cohesion loss, despite inhibition of separase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), indicates that cohesin loss in the T118E/I mutants is not due to premature separase activity. The bulk of cohesion is removed in pro-metaphase by phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit SA2 by PLK-1 kinase or Aurora-B kinase (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hauf et al., 2005</a>). We found that the PLK-1 inhibitor, BI2536, and the Aurora-B inhibitor, hesperidin, prevented cohesion loss in all the H3 expressing cell lines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Sister chromatid cohesion is also facilitated by DNA catenation during DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nitiss, 2009</a>). To prevent DNA decatenation, we used a specific inhibitor of Topo II, ICRF-193 and found that chromosomes became extremely tangled, indicative that DNA catenation is undisturbed by the H3 T118 mutations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Taken, together, these data indicate the H3 T118I and T118E mutations do not disrupt the proper establishment of sister chromatid cohesion by both DNA and sister chromatid catenation, but are likely to lead to premature cohesion loss via the PLK-1 or Aurora-B mediated pathway."

These short chromosomes occurred in 90% of the mitotic spreads from PLK-1 inhibited cells expressing H3 T118I compared to 22% for wild type H3. This hypercondensation phenotype suggests that H3 T118I may disrupt chromosome scaffolding proteins involved in shaping mitotic chromosomes, including condensin I and II and Topo II. However, H3 T118ph does not co-localize with Topo II (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) or condensin I (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Next, we determined whether the amounts of the scaffold proteins condensin I, condensin II and Topo II were altered on mitotic chromosomes in the H3 T118 mutants. The staining of Topo II (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>) and condensin II (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>) was similar among cells expressing wild type or mutant H3. However upon mitotic delay, by the error correction assay, there was a significant loss of turbo-GFP (tGFP) tagged condensin I CAP-H protein in both H3 T118E (25% of mitotic cells were tGFP negative) and T118I (50% of mitotic cells were tGFP negative) cell lines as compared to wild type H3 (0% of mitotic cells were GFP negative) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>).

We purified the condensin I complex (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) and used expressed protein ligation to generate mononucleosomes that were 100% phosphorylated on H3 T118 (<a href=\"#bib36\">North et al., 2011</a>). The histones carrying H3 T118ph generated not only canonical nucleosomes, but also altosomes and disomes (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>) as seen previously (<a href=\"#bib37\">North et al., 2014</a>). In electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) at higher levels of condensin 1, we found that condensin I could bind to nucleosomes and the altered histone-DNA forms, irrespective of the phosphorylation status of H3 T118. This result indicates that H3 T118ph does not directly affect condensin I binding to a mononucleosome. As such, we favor the idea that H3 T118ph promotes changes in global chromatin packaging that may indirectly reduce condensin I occupancy. Therefore, we asked if overexpression of Aurora-A recapitulates the loss of condensin I caused by expression of H3 T118I and T118E. Indeed, upon mitotic delay, there was a significant loss of condensin I from chromatin upon Aurora-A overexpression (25% of mitotic cells were GFP negative) as compared to the control (0% of mitotic cells were GFP negative) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). This result shows that excess H3 T118ph leads to condensin I loss from chromatin. Taken together, these data suggest that the function of mitotic H3 T118ph is to indirectly reduce condensin I and cohesin occupancy on chromatin via its influence on chromosome packaging."

In metazoans, H3 T118ph is dynamically regulated through mitosis by the Aurora-A kinase, occurring at pericentromeric regions and at discrete locations on chromosome arms. Excess H3 T118ph (achieved by overexpression of Aurora-A or mimicked by amino acid substitution) resulted in increased numbers of lagging chromosomes, defects in chromosome congression, delayed cytokinesis, altered chromosome compaction, cohesion loss and cohesin and condensin I loss. Normally, H3 T118ph disappears from each chromosome when chromosome alignment is achieved. Given that condensin I increases the rigidity at the centromere (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ribeiro et al., 2009</a>), we propose a model where H3 T118ph alters the chromatin structure to limit condensin I and cohesin occupancy in order to enable efficient attachment to the mitotic spindle and effective chromosome compaction (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

Our data further supports Aurora-A\u2019s involvement in chromosome error correction (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chm\u00e1tal et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ye et al., 2015</a>), specifically through its role in phosphorylating H3 T118 on chromatin. In agreement, the H3 protein sequence K-R-V-T-I fits the R/K/N-R-X-S/T-B consensus site for Aurora-A (where B is a hydrophobic residue) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ferrari et al., 2005</a>). We propose that Aurora-A, in partnership with its activator TPX2, is responsible for phosphorylation of H3 T118 on the chromatin arms and centromeres. Fittingly, Aurora-A is detectable at the centromere during mitosis (Chmatal, Yang et al. 2015). Precedent exists for Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation of centromeric proteins, on substrates including NDC80 (Ye, Deretic et al. 2015), CENP-A (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kunitoku et al., 2003</a>) and CENP-E (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2010a</a>). In addition to being found at the centromere, H3 T118ph also occurred in a periodic punctuate pattern along the chromosome arms. As such, H3 T118 is the first known target for phosphorylation by Aurora-A along chromosome arms. This raises the question of how Aurora-A/TPX2 is directed to phosphorylate H3 T118 along the chromosome arms. In order to gain insight into this mechanism, we attempted to map exactly where H3 T118ph occurs on chromatin by ChIP-seq, but unfortunately the antisera against H3 T118ph failed in ChIP analysis (data not shown). This was disappointing since we were able to successfully immunoprecipitate H3 T118ph with the antibody (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), raising the possibility that the antibody immunoprecipitates only H3 T118ph on free histones. Regardless of how Aurora-A is targeted to chromatin, it is likely that the phosphorylation of H3 T118ph will also require nucleosome disruption by an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler given the buried location of this residue within the nucleosome structure. As such, this would provide an additional step to tightly regulate the function of this key histone post-translational modification."

                        "text": "In addition to the insight gained from the location and timing of H3 T118ph, much of our understanding of H3 T118ph function comes from the analysis of histone mutants. Given that we can only express the H3 mutants to be approximately 10% of the total histone H3 in human cells, it is not surprising that the H3 T118A loss of function mutant gave no detectable phenotype in the presence of endogenous H3 T118ph. In contrast, the H3 T118E and T118I mutants clearly had dominant effects on wild type histones in human cells. It should be noted that <i>Drosophila</i> cell clones expressing only H3 T118A, H3 T118E, or H3 T118I have significant defects in cell growth (Graves et al., submitted). H3 T118ph acts to physically distort the nucleosomal DNA at the nucleosome dyad in order to loosen the nucleosome structure and generate altered nucleosomal states (<a href=\"#bib37\">North et al., 2014</a>). Our results show that the alterations to the nucleosome structure that are induced by H3 T118ph impact higher order levels of chromosome packaging. This structural role of phosphorylation of H3 T118 can explain why the T118I mutant gave even more drastic phenotypes than T118E in our experiments. Although isoleucine is not the classic phosphomimetic substitution, it does have a large bulky side chain that would distort the trajectory of the nucleosomal DNA around the histone octamer to an even greater extent than the traditional phosphomimetic of glutamic acid. Furthermore, isoleucine mimics the rigidity of phosphate group compared to the flexible side chain of glutamic acid. Functional support for the idea that H3 T118I structurally mimics the effect of phosphorylation of T118 comes from the fact that overexpression of the T118 kinase, Aurora-A, leads to identical phenotypes to T118I."

Furthermore, the H3 T118I and T118E mutants resulted in displacement of condensin I and cohesin from chromatin and generated chromosomes with looser chromatin packaging. Accordingly, we propose that H3 T118ph plays an important role in organizing the chromatin structure around centromeres to achieve optimal levels of cohesin and condensin I association to permit enough conformational flexibility for microtubule attachment. Condensin I is highly enriched at centromeres in mitosis in metazoans (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2013</a>) and promotes the rigidity of the centromere (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gerlich et al., 2006</a>). Additionally, Aurora\u2013A has been demonstrated to play a role in error correction by destabilizing microtubule connections of misaligned chromosomes. Upon knockdown or inhibition of Aurora-A the kinetochore, as well as their attachment to microtubules, become more rigid and stable (Chmatal, Yang et al. 2015, Ye, Deretic et al. 2015). As such, H3 T118ph at the centromere appears to act to limit condensin I occupancy in order to increase flexibility at the centromeres of misaligned chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This idea is supported by chromosomes from cells expressing H3 T118E, T118I or overexpressing Aurora-A having increased interkinetochore distances (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,G</a>), which could be indirectly or directly related to the role of H3 T118ph in removal of cohesin and condensin I. However, upon attachment to mitotic spindles from opposite centrosomes, the centromeric regions have to be rigid enough to resist the forces that the microtubules exert on the centromere in order to prevent separation of sister chromatids until anaphase (<a href=\"#bib32\">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</a>). Removal of H3 T118ph as soon as tension is sensed across the kinetochores would allow for better centromere rigidity. Consistent with an important role for H3 T118ph in achieving appropriate microtubule attachment, H3 T118ph remained at centromeres of misaligned chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

                                "text": "H3 T118ph occurs in a punctate periodic pattern along chromosome arms in prophase and pro-metaphase. Excess H3 T118ph (due to overexpression of Aurora-A or mutations that mimic the effect of phosphorylation) leads to gross alterations in chromosome compaction, with wider and shorter chromosome arms and longer, less organized chromatin loops (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), suggesting that H3 T118ph plays a role in shaping mitotic chromosomes. Mitotic chromosomes have been suggested to be packaged in a two phase process (<a href=\"#bib34\">Naumova et al., 2013</a>). In the first phase, a linear array of chromatin loops form at random, but consistent, positions along the chromosome. In the second phase, the loops longitudinally condense around the axes. These two different phases are mediated by the condensins, where condensin II is required for linear compaction along the chromosome axes while condensin I helps organize chromatin loops around the axes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shintomi and Hirano, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">Green et al., 2012</a>). Although the timing of appearance of H3 T118ph and condensin I on chromosome arms is similar, their spatial localization along the arms are distinct (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). As such, there is no evidence that H3 T118ph physically recruits or displaces condensin I from chromatin. Indeed, other proteins promote condensin recruitment in yeast including kinetochore proteins (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tada et al., 2011</a>) and the Ku heterodimer complex, which functions in non-homologous end joining (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tanaka et al., 2012</a>). Perhaps related to its recruitment mechanism, yeast condensin interacts with histone H2A and H2AZ in vitro (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tada et al., 2011</a>) and cross-linking mass spectrometry studies have found interactions between condensin I and H2A and H4 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barysz et al., 2015</a>). In addition, our evidence indicates that H3 T118 phosphorylation is likely to regulate condensin I occupancy on the chromatin, given that expression of H3 T118I, T118E and overexpression of Aurora-A cause loss of condensin I from chromosome arms (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E</a>). This disruption of condensin I function is in agreement with the longer loops of chromatin that were observed by SEM in the T118E and T118I mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Consistent with the delayed cytokinesis that occurs upon condensin I knockdown (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gerlich et al., 2006</a>) the H3 T118I and T118E mutants caused a delay in cytokinesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Given that condensin I interacts with chromosomes in a more dynamic manner than condensin II (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gerlich et al., 2006</a>),we propose that the dynamic nature of the association of condensin I with chromatin enables H3 T118ph to regulate the levels of condensin I to shape the mitotic chromosomes as they condense. The ratio of condensin I to condensin II is very tightly controlled within cells, given that changes in the ratio profoundly alters the shape of mitotic chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shintomi and Hirano, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">Bakhrebah et al., 2015</a>). As such, the removal of H3 T118ph from the chromosome arms by metaphase, either by dephosphorylation or by our preferred model of physical removal of T118 phosphorylated H3 from the DNA, is likely to regulate the ratio of condensin I:condensin II for appropriate chromosome compaction. This function is likely to occur in an indirect manner via H3 T118ph affecting chromatin structure, given that condensin I binding to mononucleosomes is not affected by H3 T118ph in vitro (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). Similarly, we propose that the loss of cohesin is an indirect consequence of the altered packaging of the chromatin structure caused by excess H3 T118ph, which may expose the cohesin ring to PLK-1 mediated phosphorylation and subsequent removal of cohesin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hauf et al., 2005</a>). However, we were unable to rule out the possibility that the cohesion phenotype may be due to loss of Sgo-1-mediated protection against PLK-1 and Aurora-B kinases."

These functions are likely to be conserved in metazoans, as we find similar localization and timing of H3 T118ph in nematodes, flies, and human cells. The importance of the ability to utilize H3 T118ph to alter the nucleosome structure to regulate mitosis is underscored by the embryonic lethality of flies where all of their histones are mutated to prevent T118 phosphorylation or to mimic persistent H3 T118 phosphorylation. Given that Aurora-A is overexpressed in many cancers, it is tempting to speculate that the carcinogenic effect of overexpressed Aurora-A may be mediated at least in part via altering the mitotic chromatin structure by phosphorylation at the nucleosome dyad."

The nuclei were resuspened in 5 different extraction buffers at increasing salt concentration (0, 600, 900, 1200, and 1500\u2009mM NaCl) Incubated on ice for 10 min. The soluble and pellet fractions were collected by centrifugation at 13,000\u2009rpm for 10 min. 5xSDS was added to the soluble fractions and boiled at 100\u00b0C for 5 min. The pellet fractions were resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcl Laemmli buffer and the Whole Cell Extract protocol was followed (as detailed below)."

Histone H3-T118 is part of a network of amino acids that position a key arginine residue (H4-R45) for interaction with nucleosomal DNA near the dyad axis. Mutations in H3T118 were first identified by genetic screens in budding yeast, and subsequent biochemical studies showed that this residue was phosphorylated in cells and that substitutions in T118 or its phosphorylation destabilized nucleosomal structure. The present study is of general interest because the physiological function of H3T118-Phos is unknown."

Using an antibody that recognizes T118-phos, the authors find that this mark is cell cycle-regulated, appearing in early mitosis where it marks the centrosomes, centromeres, and chromosome arms. Using an in vitro kinase screen, they identify Aurora A as the likely kinase. Knockdown of Aurora A appears to eliminate T118-phos from mitotic chromosomes. Based largely on results in HeLa cell lines that express exogenous histones harboring substitutions of T118 (T118A, T118E, and T118I), the authors conclude that T118-phos is important for proper chromosome alignment, and that it controls chromatin association of cohesin and condensin. Although the mutant histones are only expressed at about 10% of the level of endogenous histones, the T118E and T118I derivatives indeed caused a range of mitotic defects: lagging chromosomes, mitotic delays, loss of cohesion and condensin, and altered mitotic chromosome structure. Confirming the authors\u2019 model, similar defects are observed after over-expression of Aurora A."

This is important because much of this manuscript focuses on data where the ectopic H3T118 mutants are expressed at no more that 10% of the endogenous H3. The low percentage of mutant H3 might well explain why H3T118A has no clear phenotype.

However, there are a number of reservations, several of which will have to be addressed experimentally. We would, therefore, be interested in a revised manuscript that resolves the points outlined below. Essential revisions: 1) The most critical issue is to include a better characterization of the fly embryos with the mutated H3T118. This is important because much of this manuscript focuses on data where the ectopic H3T118 mutants are expressed at no more that 10% of the endogenous H3. The low percentage of mutant H3 might well explain why H3T118A has no clear phenotype. Nevertheless, to conclude that T118 phosphorylation is important for mitosis, this is a critical \"loss-of function\" mutant. This conundrum could be remedied by the studies in Drosophila, where flies are engineered to express H3 derivatives as the sole source of H3.

Furthermore, the defects in cell growth for T118E and T118I are even more pronounced than for T118A (Graves et al., submitted), consistent with excess T118p driving premature cohesin and condensin loss. We were unable to directly examine whether <i>Drosophila</i> embryos expressing T118A have mitotic defects because we found that in our hands the transgenes carrying the 12 wild type histone genes were not able to fully rescue the mitotic defect previously observed in Cycle 15 embryos lacking endogenous histones (EMBO Reports and <i>eLife</i>) although they do rescue viability. In addition, unfortunately the <i>Drosophila</i> chromosomes in imaginal discs are too small to examine for mitotic defects in the clones of cells expressing T118A that we generated (Graves et al., submitted). Regardless, we have removed the conclusion that T118p is important for mitosis from the current text."

However, as requested we treated cells with a variety of concentrations of ZM447439. As expected, we found that treatment of ZM447439, which decreased levels of the Aurora B target H3 S10 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1A</a>), additionally inhibited Aurora A function (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1B</a>), as evidenced by the loss of Aurora-A T288 phosphorylation. This is likely due to the fact that inhibiting Aurora B will inhibit PLK-1 [1] which in turn prevents TPX2 phosphorylation and that in turn prevents Aurora A localization to chromatin [2]. Therefore, we would expect to lose H3 T118ph when we inhibit Aurora B with ZM447439 (or by any means) because of this indirect effect on the activity of Aurora A. This is exactly what we saw. As such, the use of Aurora B inhibition with ZM447439 is not very informative."
