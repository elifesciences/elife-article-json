To combat this problem, most microalgae\u2014including Chlamydomonas\u2014have evolved processes called carbon concentrating mechanisms that increase the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> around Rubisco (<a href=\"#bib5\">Raven et al., 2014</a>). These mechanisms enhance the efficiency of photosynthesis in three ways: the active transport of bicarbonate into the chloroplast; the conversion of bicarbonate back to CO<sub>2</sub> by an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase; and the packaging of Rubisco into a small area to minimize the leakage of CO<sub>2</sub>."

There is also a carbon concentrating mechanism that involves the transport of bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>) across the plasma membrane (PM), possibly via the inorganic carbon pumps LCI1 and HLA3 (yellow barrel), and across the chloroplast envelope (CE), possibly via the inorganic carbon pump LCIA (orange barrel). The conversion of bicarbonate to CO<sub>2</sub> occurs via CAH3 (light blue circles), a carbonic anhydrase thought to be located inside the lumen of thylakoid tubules (green). When CAH3 is phosphorylated it could relocate within the pyrenoid (light grey). The pump that transfers bicarbonate from the stroma to the lumen (red barrel) has not yet been found. CO<sub>2</sub> is prevented from leaking out of the pyrenoid by the starch sheath (dark grey) and LCIB/C protein complexes (triangles). (<b>B</b>) Observations made by Engel et al. demonstrate that minitubules (white) provide a direct route between the stroma and the pyrenoid. This resolves how RuBP, which is the substrate for Rubisco (see text), is channelled to the enzyme, and how 3PGA, which is a product of the reaction between RuBP and CO<sub>2</sub>, is channelled away. It also raises the intriguing possibility that CAH3 could be external to the thylakoid lumen. When phosphorylated, CAH3 could relocate close to or within the minitubules, also allowing CO<sub>2</sub> to be delivered via the minitubules to Rubisco without the need for an additional bicarbonate transporter."

Some of these features were visible in early electron micrograph images (<a href=\"#bib6\">Sager and Palade, 1957</a>), but Engel et al. reveal how additional features called minitubules are organised within the tubules that cross the pyrenoid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The minitubules contain stroma and the latest work clearly shows that they could provide routes for molecules to move from the stroma directly into the centre of the pyrenoid. This would allow substrates and products to move between Rubisco and the other enzymes involved in photosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib7\">S\u00fcss et al., 1995</a>), and could reduce the need to transport bicarbonate across the thylakoid membranes, as is required in existing models (<a href=\"#bib8\">Wang et al., 2011</a>)."

If their proposed model of close-packing in hexagonal shapes is exact, the spacing of Rubisco complexes leaves room for molecules of between 5 kDa and ~50 kDa, depending on the packaging scenario. The latter is sufficient space for a Rubisco linker protein like the one needed inside the carboxysomes of bacteria, but it is not clear whether such proteins also exist in algae (<a href=\"#bib3\">Long et al., 2007</a>)."

Efforts are being made to engineer elements of the carbon concentrating mechanism from cyanobacteria into higher plants (<a href=\"#bib2\">Lin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">McGrath and Long, 2014</a>), but what modifications would be needed to incorporate a mechanism from algae instead?"

However, in the best traditions of product placement, other forms of pyrenoid are available in different species, including phytoplankton and one lineage of primitive land plants. Understanding the structure of chloroplasts and the regulation of carbon concentrating mechanisms in these organisms will continue to provide additional challenges for the future."
