                    "text": "In higher eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains a network of membrane tubules, which transitions into sheets during mitosis. Network formation involves curvature-stabilizing proteins, including the reticulons (Rtns), as well as the membrane-fusing GTPase atlastin (ATL) and the lunapark protein (Lnp). Here, we have analyzed how these proteins cooperate. ATL is needed to not only form, but also maintain, the ER network. Maintenance requires a balance between ATL and Rtn, as too little ATL activity or too high Rtn4a concentrations cause ER fragmentation. Lnp only affects the abundance of three-way junctions and tubules. We suggest a model in which ATL-mediated fusion counteracts the instability of free tubule ends. ATL tethers and fuses tubules stabilized by the Rtns, and transiently sits in newly formed three-way junctions. Lnp subsequently moves into the junctional sheets and forms oligomers. Lnp is inactivated by mitotic phosphorylation, which contributes to the tubule-to-sheet conversion of the ER."

Network formation involves curvature-stabilizing proteins, including the reticulons (Rtns), as well as the membrane-fusing GTPase atlastin (ATL) and the lunapark protein (Lnp). Here, we have analyzed how these proteins cooperate. ATL is needed to not only form, but also maintain, the ER network. Maintenance requires a balance between ATL and Rtn, as too little ATL activity or too high Rtn4a concentrations cause ER fragmentation. Lnp only affects the abundance of three-way junctions and tubules. We suggest a model in which ATL-mediated fusion counteracts the instability of free tubule ends. ATL tethers and fuses tubules stabilized by the Rtns, and transiently sits in newly formed three-way junctions. Lnp subsequently moves into the junctional sheets and forms oligomers. Lnp is inactivated by mitotic phosphorylation, which contributes to the tubule-to-sheet conversion of the ER."

When ATL was inactivated, the network disassembled into small spheres called vesicles. Increasing the amount of Rtn within the endoplasmic reticulum also caused it to disassemble, but increasing the amount of ATL could reverse this fragmentation. Thus, maintaining the tubular network requires a balance between the activities of the ATL and Rtn proteins, with ATL appearing to tether and fuse tubules that are stabilized by the Rtns."

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a particularly intriguing organelle, as it consists of morphologically distinct domains that change during differentiation and cell cycle. In interphase, the ER consists of the nuclear envelope and a connected peripheral network of tubules and interspersed sheets (<a href=\"#bib27\">Shibata et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">English and Voeltz, 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goyal and Blackstone, 2013</a>). The network is dynamic, with tubules continuously forming, retracting, and sliding along one another. During mitosis in metazoans, the nuclear envelope disassembles and peripheral ER tubules are transformed into sheets (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Wang et al., 2013</a>).

The Rtns and DP1/Yop1p seem to stabilize the high membrane curvature seen in cross-sections of tubules and sheet edges (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Shibata et al., 2009</a>).

Crystal structures and biochemical experiments have led to a model in which ATL molecules sitting in different membranes dimerize through their GTPase domains (trans-interaction), and undergo a conformational change during the GTPase cycle, thereby pulling the two membranes together and fusing them. Interestingly, ATL molecules sitting in the same membrane can also form GTPase-dependent dimers (cis-interaction) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Liu et al., 2015</a>)."

Consequently, ER morphology changes are difficult to interpret. ER morphology can also be studied with extracts from <i>Xenopus laevis</i> eggs. Both crude extracts and isolated membranes can be used to form a tubular network in vitro (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dreier and Rapoport, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). With interphase extracts, the network consists exclusively of tubules connected by three-way junctions, whereas a tubule-to-sheet conversion and a loss of three-way junctions are observed with mitotic (meiotic) extracts (<a href=\"#bib29\">Wang et al., 2013</a>).

We demonstrate that ATL function is not only required to form an ER network but, surprisingly, is also needed to maintain it. The integrity of tubules is maintained by a balance of ATL and Rtn function. Lnp is not essential for network formation, but its inactivation or absence causes the loss of three-way junctions and tubules in favor of sheets. Our results suggest mechanisms by which a tubular ER network is formed and maintained, as well as changed during mitosis."

Thus, the punctate localization of ATL-3 to three-way junctions is due to its dimerization with endogenous ATL. The different localization patterns of ATL-1 and ATL-3 have been attributed to the fact that ATL-1 hydrolyzes GTP faster than ATL-3; faster GTP hydrolysis would lead to less concentration in junctions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Yan et al., 2015</a>)."

Expression of ATL-1 K80A caused the conversion of most of the ER into small vesicles, which rapidly moved around the cell, as shown by time-lapse imaging (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; first column; the lowest row shows three different time points with different colors; see also <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). In many cells, long, unbranched tubules were also seen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; second column; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). These membrane tubules were aligned with microtubules and seemed to be pulled out from a membrane reservoir near the nucleus after cell division (not shown). Indeed, treatment of the cells with the microtubule-disassembling drug nocodazole led to the disappearance of the long membrane tubules (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Expression of a double mutant of ATL-1, which is both GTPase- and dimerization- defective (ATL-1 K80A R217Q) left the reticular ER intact (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; third column), demonstrating that the ATL-1 K80A mutant causes ER morphology changes by forming inactive dimers with endogenous ATL. In agreement with previous experiments (<a href=\"#bib23\">Rismanchi et al., 2008</a>), we find that ATL-1 R217Q causes ER morphology defects in cells that express high amounts of this protein, but this is not caused by interference with endogenous ATL, but rather by non-specific membrane crowding. Vesiculation of the ER was also observed with dominant-negative, GTPase-defective ATL-2 or ATL-3 mutants (ATL-3 K73A or ATL-2 K107A; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; fourth column; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>, respectively)."

A cytoplasmic fragment of wild type ATL-1 (cytATL-1-mCherry) only generated long, unbranched tubules, even at high expression levels (fourth column), likely because it interacts with endogenous ATL only transiently during the GTPase cycle and is therefore a weaker inhibitor than cytATL-1 K80A. Consistent with this assumption, cytATL-1 K80A localized more prominently to the ER than wild type cytATL-1 (not shown), and non-dimerizing versions of cytATL-1 K80A or cytATL-1, which carry the R217Q mutation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Byrnes and Sondermann, 2011</a>), did not affect the morphology of the ER (columns five and six)."

As reported previously, an ER network can be generated from membrane fragment in a crude interphase extract (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>); network formation is prevented when membrane fusion is inhibited by the addition of a dominant-negative cytoplasmic fragment of <i>Xenopus</i> ATL (cytATL) at the beginning of the reaction (<a href=\"#bib29\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). <i>Xenopus</i> ATL is homologous to mammalian ATL-2 and is the only ATL annotated in the <i>Xenopus</i> genome. Surprisingly, we found that cytATL also disassembled a preformed network. At low concentrations, a fragmented tubular network remained (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). At higher concentrations, only small membrane structures were observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). A non-dimerizing mutant of cytATL (cytATL R232Q) had no effect on the integrity of the network (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), likely because it did not bind to the endogenous ATL. Inhibition of endogenous ATL by addition of GTP\u03b3S also disassembled the network (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Similar results were obtained with a fractionated system, consisting either of <i>Xenopus</i> membranes and membrane-depleted cytosol (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) or of membranes only (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

When cytATL-GFP arrived in the chamber, the network disassembled, starting at the site where cytATL-GFP arrived (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Close observation of the disassembly reaction showed that tubules frequently first detach from one another (arrows) before they crumble and convert into smaller structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

Occasionally, dynamic sheets were seen from which short tubules emerge and retract (not shown). These structures are possibly explained by residual ATL activity. They were much more abundant during early time points of network formation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), or if network formation was slowed down by partial inhibition of ATL, for example, by adding a low concentration of GTP to a membrane-only reaction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), or by adding GDP and AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> to a reaction consisting of membranes and cytosol (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These intermediates in network formation are dynamic, small structures from which tubules continuously emanate and retract, although the disappearance of some tubules may simply be due to their bending or movement out of the focal plane (<a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>). These results indicate that during network formation, ATL first mediates the fusion of small vesicles into small, dynamic structures, which subsequently give rise to longer tubules. Inactivation of ATL disassembles the tubules into small membrane structures. Our experiments also indicate that, at endogenous levels, the reticulons and DP1 are insufficient to maintain the integrity of tubules in the absence of ATL function."

These molecules likely represent inactive dimers formed with endogenous ATL; the fraction of inactivated endogenous ATL is apparently small enough to maintain the integrity of the network. Similar results were obtained with a fractionated system, consisting of membranes and cytosol. Again, antibodies to <i>Xenopus</i> ATL stained three-way junctions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), whereas cytATL-GFP stained the entire network (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; left panel).

We first expressed in U2OS cells a mCherry-fusion of Rtn4a, which has a long cytoplasmic N-terminus preceding the conserved membrane-embedded, reticulon-homology (RHD) domain (<a href=\"#bib28\">Voeltz et al., 2006</a>). At low expression levels, mCherry-Rtn4a distributed together with GFP-calreticulin throughout the tubules of the ER (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). At higher levels, unbranched tubules were seen (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Often these tubules were depleted of GFP-calreticulin, suggesting that these were too narrow to accommodate luminal proteins, as observed previously in transient overexpression experiments (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hu et al., 2008</a>). In addition, some of the ER was fragmented; the membrane fragments contained both GFP-calreticulin and mCherry-Rtn4 and moved rapidly (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>), but they seemed to be larger than in cells expressing dominant-negative ATL mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Perhaps, they correspond to fractured tubules. Fragmentation of the ER by overexpression of Rtn4a had not been observed in fixed cells, again highlighting the need for live-cell imaging."

This effect is due to the fusion activity of ATL because the co-expression of the dimerization-defective ATL-1 R217Q mutant did not restore the network (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). As expected, the co-overexpression of the dominant-negative ATL1- K80A mutant and Rtn4a resulted in both long, unbranched tubules and small vesicles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Interestingly, Rtn4a and ATL seemed to segregate at least partially, perhaps because Rtn displaces ATL molecules from long tubules. Taken together, our results suggest that an appropriate balance between ATL and Rtn4a is required for network formation; too little ATL function, or too much Rtn4a, results in similar morphology defects, i.e. long, unbranched tubules and fragmented ER."

We generated a CRISPR knock-out of lunapark in U2OS cells that express GFP-calreticulin (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Cells lacking Lnp exhibited a proliferation of peripheral sheets and a reduction of tubules and junctions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>; quantification in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). However, the tubular network did not completely disappear in all cells. Immunostaining with reticulon antibodies showed that the residual tubular ER was often pushed to the periphery of the cells (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, Lnp is not essential to form tubules or three-way junctions, but it affects their abundance. These results are consistent with the ER morphology reported for a Lnp knock-out in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2012</a>), although the small cell size of this organism makes the distinction between tubules and sheets difficult."

Lnp consists of an N-terminal myristoylated glycine (<a href=\"#bib20\">Moriya et al., 2013</a>), a coiled-coil domain (CC1), two closely spaced trans-membrane segments (TM1 and TM2), another coiled-coil domain (CC2), a predicted unstructured segment, a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger domain implicated Lnp dimerization (<a href=\"#bib5\">Casey et al., 2015</a>), and a C-terminal unstructured segment (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). A Lnp mutant, in which the N-terminal myristoylation site was abolished (G2A mutation), failed to localize to junctions (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Likewise, when a short, unrelated linker sequence was inserted after CC1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>) or before CC2 (not shown), Lnp no longer concentrated in punctae (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), suggesting that the two coiled-coil domains need to be in register. Finally, truncation of Lnp before the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger domain also abolished Lnp localization to three-way junctions, whereas a truncation at a more C-terminal site had no effect (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). In all cases, localization of Lnp to three-way junctions correlated with the conversion of peripheral sheets into a tubular network, indicating that Lnp exerts its effect on ER morphology at junctions. At high levels, all Lnp mutants generated sheets and aberrant structures (not shown). Taken together, these results show that localization to three-way junctions requires several Lnp features, including the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger implicated in dimerization. Indeed, pull-down experiments with extracts of mammalian cells expressing different Lnp constructs show that the region containing the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger is required for Lnp-Lnp interaction (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>)."

The large sheets observed when Lnp-mCherry was expressed at high level in wild type U2OS cells disappeared when wild type GFP-ATL-3 or GFP-ATL-1 were co-expressed (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>; compare second and third with first column). The ER network was restored, and the ATL proteins localized as in wild type cells. GFP-ATL-3 was always close to Lnp-mCherry, and was often found at the edges of the Lnp-containing structures, but the two proteins did not co-localize (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>; second column). Expression of GFP-ATL-1 also caused Lnp-mCherry to redistribute from large to small sheet-like structures (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>; third column), even though ATL-1 itself localized mostly throughout the tubules. Taken together, these results indicate that ATL affects the localization of Lnp, although the bulk of ATL and Lnp do not seem to interact physically. In agreement with this conclusion, no interaction was seen in pull-down experiments (not shown). Our experiments also suggest that ATL functions upstream of Lnp, a conclusion that is supported by the observation that Lnp overexpression did not significantly affect the localization of the ATLs (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>), and did not reverse ER fragmentation in cells expressing dominant-negative ATL mutants (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

                                "text": "To further investigate the role of Lnp in shaping the ER, we used the <i>Xenopus</i> extract system. We reasoned that a cytoplasmic fragment of <i>Xenopus</i> Lnp (cytLnp), containing the sequence following TM2 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>),\u00a0might interact with the endogenous protein and serve as a dominant-negative reagent. Indeed, when purified cytLnp was added to a crude extract at the beginning of a network formation reaction, small sheets appeared over time, which replaced three-way tubular junctions (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B;</a> the reduction of three-way junctions is quantitated in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>).\u00a0In addition, the tubules of the network became shorter. The number of three-way junctions was also reduced when cytLnp was added to a network formation reaction performed with membranes and cytosol (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D</a>)\u00a0or with membranes alone (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In these cases, the junctions were converted into bright membrane structures, which look different from those observed in crude extracts (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). Whether these structures are sheets therefore remains uncertain. Three-way junctions were also abolished when cytLnp was added after network formation (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Affinity-purified antibodies raised against <i>Xenopus</i> Lnp had the same effect (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E</a> and <a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), confirming that Lnp inactivation causes the change in ER morphology. A C-terminal fragment of cytLnp (cytLnp-C) had the same effect on the integrity of three-way junctions as cytLnp, whereas two different N-terminal fragments (cytLnp-N1 and \u2013N2) were inactive (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11F</a>). Pull-down experiments confirmed that cytLnp and cytLnp-C, but not cytLnp-N1 or \u2013N2, interact with endogenous Lnp (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). The Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger-containing constructs cytLnp and cytLnp-C likely form inactive oligomers with the endogenous full-length protein. Consistent with this assumption, gel filtration experiments indicated that cytLnp and cytLnp-C form oligomers, in contrast to cytLnp-N1 and cytLnp-N2, which elute as monomers (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Taken together, these results are consistent with those obtained in mammalian cells, and show that Lnp stabilizes three-way tubular junctions and tubules. Lnp-Lnp interactions involving the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger containing domain seem to be required for the function of Lnp."

Overexpression of Rtn4a leads to long, unbranched tubules and fragmented ER. Both phenotypes are restored when ATL is co-overexpressed. Taken together, our data indicate that a balance between ATL and Rtn function is required. Lnp is not essential for network formation or maintenance; its inactivation or deletion only reduces the abundance of three-way junctions and tubules in favor of larger sheets. Lnp is phosphorylated during mitosis, which weakens its oligomerization and may contribute to the characteristic tubule-to-sheet conversion of the ER during mitosis."

A GTP-hydrolysis- dependent conformational change in ATL trans-dimers pulls the apposing membranes together so that they can fuse. ATL-mediated fusion requires multiple ATL molecules in each membrane (<a href=\"#bib18\">Liu et al., 2015</a>), and multiple cycles of GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Saini et al., 2014</a>). It is therefore likely that ATL molecules are concentrated at the site of fusion between two ER tubules. Cis-dimerization in the same membrane (<a href=\"#bib18\">Liu et al., 2015</a>) and nucleotide-independent interactions through the TM segments (<a href=\"#bib17\">Liu et al., 2012</a>) may also increase ATL localization at these sites before and after fusion. Eventually, however, ATL would diffuse away from three way junctions and distribute throughout the tubules. This model may explain why mammalian ATL-2 and ATL-3, as well as <i>Xenopus</i> ATL, preferentially localize to three-way junctions. Mammalian ATL-1 is only marginally concentrated, perhaps because fewer molecules are required for a successful fusion event or because it diffuses away more rapidly from the fused junction."

When ATL function is moderately inhibited, long, unbranched tubules are formed, likely because these cannot be linked into a network. When ATL is more strongly inhibited, even tubules are disrupted. A possible explanation for the essential role of ATL in maintaining the integrity of tubules is based on the observation that free ends of tubules are rarely seen in mammalian cells or in networks generated in vitro with <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts; essentially all tubule ends are anchored either in three-way junctions or are associated with molecular motors or microtubule tips. We therefore propose that tubules are unstable when they have free ends. Free ends have a high membrane curvature at the tip, and the elastic energy would be reduced if they retracted in favor of other tubules that are anchored, or if they shed small vesicles. Shedding of vesicles from a free tubule end would be favored by Rtn, which itself imposes high curvature on the membrane. At physiological concentrations, Rtn would stabilize the high membrane curvature of tubules in cross-section, but it may prefer to sit in a vesicle of the same radius, particularly if it formed a hydrophobic insertion, rather than a scaffold around the bilayer. ATL would be essential for tubule integrity, as it would counteract the vesicle shedding at the tips of tubules by capturing shedding vesicles via its tethering function and then fusing them back onto the tubule. This model is consistent with our observations of early intermediates during network formation in <i>Xenopus</i> extracts. Initially, vesicles seem to fuse into dynamic small membrane structures that continuously emanate and retract short tubules. These tubules have free ends and are unstable, and their dynamic nature may correspond to a situation in which their shortening is reversed by their ATL-mediated fusion with small vesicles. Our interpretation implies that the shedding and fusion of vesicles at tubule ends occur at comparable rates, whereas the breakage of tubules or three-way junctions may be kinetically disfavored. Indeed, live-cell imaging of the ER in mammalian cells or <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts shows that tubules rarely undergo fission in the middle of the tubule. Instead, retraction of tubules is a frequent event and might involve the shedding of vesicles at tubule tips."

Because ATL needs multiple cycles of trans-dimerization to achieve fusion, it may tether tubules together at three way junctions that have not yet fused. ATL inactivation would cause the disassembly of a preformed ER network by the untethering of these tubules, leading to the appearance of free, unstable tubule ends. It is unclear whether this model can explain the disassembly of the entire network in the <i>Xenopus</i> system, as it would imply that a high percentage of three-way junctions is actually only tethered, rather than fused. It is also possible that ATL is required to maintain the integrity of fused three-way junctions, for example, by stabilizing the negatively curved edge line bordering the triangular junctional sheet. We also found that a significantly stronger inhibition of ATL is required to disassemble a preformed network than to prevent its <i>de nov</i>o formation. Perhaps, trans-dimerization and fusion are more sensitive to ATL inhibition than ATL concentration at three-way junctions. It has been proposed that the yeast ortholog of ATL, Sey1p, is merely a tethering molecule akin to Rab GTPases, and that the actual fusion is mediated by ER SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lee et al., 2015</a>). However, mutations in Sey1p and ER SNAREs have synthetic effects in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anwar et al., 2012</a>), indicating that they function in parallel pathways.

The overexpression of Rtn generates very narrow tubules, from which the luminal protein calreticulin is displaced. Assuming that ATL is also displaced, the appearance of long, unbranched tubules may simply be explained by their inability to form new three-way junctions or to fuse vesicles to the end of tubules. In addition, Rtn overexpression could lead to its oligomerization, which could contribute to the formation and stabilization of long tubules. Rtn4a overexpression also generates membrane fragments, which appear to be larger than those observed upon ATL inactivation. Perhaps, these fragments originate from the breakage of the narrow tubules. Co-overexpression of ATL with Rtn would rescue both phenotypes, unbranched tubules and fragmentation, as it allows ATL to localize into the tubules to restore three-way junction formation and to fuse membrane fragments together. Our studies were restricted to Rtn4a, and it remains to be seen whether other Rtn isoforms and DP1 behave in a similar manner."

In mammalian cells, some reticular network is retained in its absence, and even in <i>Xenopus</i> extracts, where Lnp inactivation converts most three-way junctions into larger sheets, there is still a network. Many of these sheets are bordered by negatively curved edge lines, suggesting that Lnp is not a major stabilizer of such edges (<a href=\"#bib26\">Shemesh et al., 2014</a>). Based on the observation that Lnp forms sheet-like structures when overexpressed in mammalian cells, it seems possible that Lnp localizes to the sheets of tubular junctions. This is consistent with the fact that ATL-3 sits at the edges of expanded junctional sheets in Lnp-overexpressing cells. Because ATL is absolutely required to generate tubular junctions, one may assume that ATL first forms a native junction and sits at its edges, and then Lnp moves to the interior sheet. Perhaps, a Lnp scaffold prevents the reticulons and DP1 from moving into the three-way junction and thus counteracts junction expansion; when Lnp is absent or inactivated, the three-way junction area could increase into a larger sheet. Alternatively, Lnp may somehow promote the curvature-stabilizing function of the reticulons and DP1, thus helping in tubule formation."

However, the coiled-coil domains are probably also important. These regions immediately flank the TMs in all species and our experiments suggest that their correct registry is required for Lnp\u2019s localization to three-way junctions. The N-terminal myristic acid is also important, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib20\">Moriya et al., 2013</a>), perhaps because it anchors the N-terminus in the membrane.

The ER in mitotic Xenopus extracts looks strikingly similar to that generated by Lnp inactivation, and the absence of Lnp in mammalian cells also causes a tubule-to-sheet conversion. These results suggest that Lnp inactivation may be responsible for, or at least contribute to, the ER morphology changes during mitosis. Consistent with this idea, Lnp is mitotically phosphorylated in <i>Xenopus</i> extracts and mammalian tissue culture cells. In mammalian cells, Lnp is also degraded, as seen with other mitotically phosphorylated proteins. Phosphorylation of Lnp interferes with its oligomerization, and phosphomimetic Lnp mutants no longer localizes to three-way junctions and have a lower propensity to form oligomers. The effect on oligomerization can be explained by the fact that most phosphorylation sites are located in a region between the second coiled-coil and Zn<sup>2+</sup> finger domains, both of which may be involved in Lnp-Lnp interactions. Taken together, these results suggest that mitotic phosphorylation reduces Lnp\u2019s oligomerization, which in turn results in its departure from three-way junctions. The absorption of membrane lipids into the junctions would result in their expansion into larger sheets. It is possible that other factors, such as the disruption of the ER \u2013 cytoskeleton interaction, or the release of translating ribosomes from the ER, contribute to the transition from tubules to sheets during mitosis. Sheet formation during mitosis might be required to accommodate membrane proteins that prefer low membrane curvature areas and sit during interphase in the relatively flat nuclear envelope."

                        "text": "Taken together, our results suggest a simple model for the generation and maintenance of a tubular ER network. ATL is required to both form and maintain a network. It mediates the fusion of tubules by forming GTP hydrolysis-dependent trans-dimers and transiently sits in the newly formed three-way junctions. Lnp subsequently moves into the junctional sheets, a process that may require its oligomerization. The reticulons stabilize high membrane curvature in tubules and may cause vesicle shedding at free tubule ends, a process counteracted by ATL through its tethering and fusion activity. During mitosis, Lnp is phosphorylated, causing it to dissociate into monomers and leave the three-way junctions. This would result in the expansion of three-way junctions into larger sheets. Experiments with reconstituted, purified ER shaping proteins are required to test this simple model and to understand the exact molecular mechanism of network formation."

First, the migration shift in panels A and B could be due to modifications other than phosphorylation (e.g., Sumo, Ubiquitin, etc.), and in fact protein bands look quite crisp for what might be a range of phosphorylation states. Second, just because different sites are identified by mass spectrometry doesn't mean all are simultaneously present in the same lunapark protein (raising questions about the relevance of the phosphomimetic construct used). Third, what does the mitotic western look like in the nocodazole treatment arm in panel C? Overall, the reviewers suggest to leave out the entire figure. The authors could consider a much more detailed investigation of the role of mitotic phosphorylation incorporating studies of other proteins involved in ER network formation such as atlastin."
