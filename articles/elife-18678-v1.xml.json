Here, we show that this seemingly successful disease management strategy can fail with devastating consequences for infected hosts. We deploy cooperation theory and a novel synthetic system involving the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. In vivo infections of rice demonstrate that <i>M. oryzae</i> virulence is enhanced, quite paradoxically, when a public good mutant is present in a population of high-virulence pathogens. We reason that during infection, the fungus engages in multiple cooperative acts to exploit host resources. We establish a multi-trait cooperation model which suggests that the observed failure of the virulence reduction strategy is caused by the interference between different social traits. Multi-trait cooperative interactions are widespread, so we caution against the indiscriminant application of anti-virulence therapy as a disease-management strategy."

Here, we show that this seemingly successful disease management strategy can fail with devastating consequences for infected hosts. We deploy cooperation theory and a novel synthetic system involving the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. In vivo infections of rice demonstrate that <i>M. oryzae</i> virulence is enhanced, quite paradoxically, when a public good mutant is present in a population of high-virulence pathogens. We reason that during infection, the fungus engages in multiple cooperative acts to exploit host resources. We establish a multi-trait cooperation model which suggests that the observed failure of the virulence reduction strategy is caused by the interference between different social traits. Multi-trait cooperative interactions are widespread, so we caution against the indiscriminant application of anti-virulence therapy as a disease-management strategy."

An alternative strategy is to use live organisms to reduce pathogen virulence through competitive displacement. This idea is particularly promising; proving successful in some animal (<a href=\"#bib31\">Harrison et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Rumbaugh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pollitt et al., 2014</a>) and plant (<a href=\"#bib23\">Frey et al., 1994</a>) models, as well as clinical (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gerding et al., 2015</a>) and agricultural field studies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amaike and Keller, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cotty, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cotty and Bayman, 1993</a>)."

Indeed, recent clinical trials exploited a low virulence, non-toxigenic strain of <i>Clostridium difficile</i> in patients to out-compete virulent toxin-producing strains (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gerding et al., 2015</a>). Similar treatments are commercially available in agriculture (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amaike and Keller, 2011</a>) where a low virulence non-toxigenic strain of <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> is used to prevent virulent toxin-producing strains from infecting crops through competitive exclusion (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cotty, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cotty and Bayman, 1993</a>). Even cancers are known to evolve heterogeneous cell populations and, as a result, the exploitation of competitive interactions between tumour cells is seen as a promising disease treatment (<a href=\"#bib40\">Korolev et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jansen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tabassum and Polyak, 2015</a>). Is the competitive displacement strategy failsafe, however, or is there a risk that such interventions might have unforeseen consequences? Here, we address this question using cooperation theory and a new synthetic system involving the rice blast fungus."

The most common type of pathogen cooperation involves production of extracellular factors used to perform a range of functions that directly or indirectly contribute to pathogen virulence and so are referred to as virulence factors. Direct virulence factors aid pathogenesis by directly interacting with and damaging the host, such as by the production of infection structures or toxins (<a href=\"#bib62\">Raymond et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">West et al., 2007</a>). Alternatively, indirect virulence factors facilitate the survival and proliferation of the pathogen within the host. Examples include products for nutrient acquisition, suppression or evasion of host immunity, antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation and behaviours which can be coordinated by quorum sensing molecules (<a href=\"#bib31\">Harrison et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Rumbaugh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pollitt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">West et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">K\u00f6hler et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). Such extracellular factors can be considered public goods, because they benefit every individual in the locality and are therefore open to exploitation by cheats who do not contribute to the cost of their production, but still reap the rewards. Since public goods aid microbial growth and survival, they also affect the extent of damage that pathogens can inflict on their hosts. As a consequence, cooperators that produce extracellular factors are often more virulent than non-producing mutants (<a href=\"#bib31\">Harrison et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Rumbaugh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pollitt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Raymond et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">K\u00f6hler et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buckling and Brockhurst, 2008</a>)."

In that case, cooperation theory predicts that the presence of public good cheats with low virulence within a population of virulent public good cooperators leads to a reduction in overall virulence of the population (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buckling and Brockhurst, 2008</a>). It is important to note that this does not apply to systems where cheats are more virulent than cooperators, as in the case of prudent resource use, since an introduction of cheats with high virulence into a population of cooperators with low virulence will lead to an increase in population virulence (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bremermann, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Nowak and May, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Frank, 1996</a>)."

To identify a cooperative public good-producing trait, we focused on traits that enable the fungus to exploit nutrients inside host tissue for proliferation and spore production, which is widely used as a proxy for pathogen fitness (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Given that the most abundant storage sugar within plant tissue is sucrose, we reasoned that secreted invertase production might represent a social trait and an indirect virulence factor. Invertase catalyses the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose, which are preferred carbon sources, that are then transported into <i>M. oryzae</i> by hexose transporters for metabolism (<a href=\"#bib74\">Talbot, 2010</a>). We reasoned that in a mixed population, an invertase mutant may behave as a \u2018cheat\u2019 because it can exploit the monosaccharides liberated by invertase-secreting individuals. Here we test the competitive displacement anti-virulence strategy by investigating how fungal virulence is affected in mixed population of cooperators and cheats exhibiting different levels of virulence."

This confirmed the function of <i>INV1</i> and demonstrated the benefit of the public good to populations of producers. To establish that invertase is exploitable by non-producers, we showed that \u0394<i>inv1</i> mutants can recover their ability to grow on sucrose, provided that invertase activity is provided by the presence of an isogenic wild type strain Guy11 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>).

Furthermore, in sufficiently structured environments, the producer can gain a selective advantage when it is rare in a population consisting predominantly of non-producers (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In this case the fitness of the producer is negative-frequency-dependent and the coexistence of both producers and non-producers is possible at intermediate frequency.

Infection studies were conducted over nine days following an entire rotation in a polycyclic disease (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), using infection assays that are comparable to wild infections (see Materials and methods). According to all prior theory and in vivo infection experiments, we expected that the virulence of the population would decrease in such an infection (<a href=\"#bib31\">Harrison et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Rumbaugh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pollitt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">K\u00f6hler et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buckling and Brockhurst, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brown et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crespi et al., 2014</a>).

We then tested if this increased fitness in mixed infections translated into more damage to the host. Again, infecting populations comprised exclusively of the highly virulent invertase producers were not the most virulent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, introducing less virulent non-producers into a population of highly virulent producers can lead to an increase in the production of new spores (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) and crucially to an increase in the damage to the host (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), compared to infections consisting only of the highly virulent producers. Moreover, the new spores generated at the end of the mixed infection, which instigate a new infection cycle, contained both producer and non-producer strains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

We postulated that this might result from multiple-interacting social traits (<a href=\"#bib52\">MacLean et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brown and Taylor, 2009</a>). The impact of public goods on virulence has only ever been considered in isolation, without considering the influence of additional social dilemmas facing the pathogen. We reasoned that alongside public goods production, <i>M. oryzae</i> faces a second social dilemma of self-restraint or \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hardin, 1968</a>), which requires a pathogen to convert available resources into energy slowly but efficiently, as opposed to rapidly and inefficiently. When we investigated this possibility, we found evidence of a rate-efficiency trade-off (<a href=\"#bib53\">Meyer et al., 2015</a>) whereby faster-growing populations were less efficient in spore production per unit of carbon resource (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), suggesting a tragedy of the commons scenario can occur in sugar utilisation by the pathogen during plant infection. The multi-trait interactions matter most if one considers the spatial and temporal trajectory of population growth. When producers are common, invertase production is expected to result in a large spike, both spatial and temporal, in available glucose. This would enable rapid but inefficient growth of the pathogen. However, if a fraction of non-producers is introduced into the population, the glucose spike around producers in the vicinity of non-producers would be smaller, such that the population would consume finite resources more efficiently. This would lead to fitter and more virulent populations, as observed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a\u2013b</a>."

To test this idea, we generated a mathematical model incorporating both social traits and taking into account the inherently spatial nature of plant infections (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013d</a>; for model details see Appendix 1B and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). The model successfully produced the unexpected empirical result (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>) and also predicted that the presence of the second social dilemma is key to observing such an outcome. Namely, by removing the self-restraint constraint from the model, we recover the initially expected result, whereby populations consisting entirely of producers are fitter than populations containing a mixture of producers and non-producers (<a href=\"#bib31\">Harrison et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Rumbaugh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pollitt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buckling and Brockhurst, 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). The same outcome was achieved by neutralising the influence of the rate-efficiency trade-off in spatially homogeneous environments where resources are shared equally between competitors, thus preventing the formation of glucose spikes around producers (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>)."

We found that when <i>M. oryzae</i> was grown in spatially structured environments containing sucrose as the sole sugar in concentrations for which a rate-efficiency trade-off is effective (1%), the pathogen population fitness was maximised when it contained a mixture of producers and non-producers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). This is consistent with both infection observations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) and predictions of the model (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). The result also suggests that enhanced fitness of mixed infections is not caused by compensatory up-regulation of genes in non-producers, targeting other host nutrients. In a sucrose concentration (0.01%) where the growth rate is relatively low and so the rate-efficiency trade-off will be weak or non-existent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), we observed that the pathogen fitness was no longer amplified when non-producers were present in the population (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>), as predicted again by our model (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). The\u00a0spatial structure of the fungus can be restricted through resource homogenization by supplying resources in the form of glucose (1% w/v) instead of sucrose and hence preventing glucose spikes around producers to occur, or through liquid culture in sucrose-containing growth medium (1% w/v). Consistent with the model predictions, the fitness advantage of mixed populations was lost in terms of biomass production (liquid cultures, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>) and conidia production (resource homogenization, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). Since invertase production in <i>M.\u00a0oryzae</i> is sucrose-induced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>) producers do not pay the cost of invertase production and therefore do not suffer a reduction in fitness compared to non-producers in glucose environments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>)."

                        "text": "Our study suggests that infections comprised purely of highly virulent micro-organisms may be limited in their population fitness by inefficient resource use, through a rate-efficiency trade-off. Introduction of a lower virulence strain can therefore alleviate the constraints on efficiency of resource utilization experienced by the virulent strain, by reducing the local resource concentration. This makes the overall pathogen population more virulent, rather than less virulent as was expected. While a mixture of public good cooperators and cheats has been found to maximize microbial fitness in vitro (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lee et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">MacLean et al., 2010</a>), our study shows for the first time that this can be observed in a host-pathogen infection system. A major consequence of this observation is that any competitive displacement virulence reduction strategy that targets the secreted products of pathogens (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gerding et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cotty, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cotty and Bayman, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Korolev et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jansen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brown et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crespi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Foster, 2005</a>) can fail due to complex multi-level interactions between strains that individually show different levels of virulence. It is therefore critical to define and understand cooperative and competitive interactions that must occur within heterogeneous pathogen populations when designing such virulence reduction strategies. This is specifically relevant for systems where pathogens secrete virulence factors into the public domain making them exploitable by non-secretors, rather than delivering virulence factors into individual host cells."

Based on previous research (<a href=\"#bib52\">MacLean et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brown and Taylor, 2009</a>), we postulated that the interactions between two social traits, public goods production and self-restraint, may collectively increase virulence of the pathogen population. Our mathematical model and the subsequent experimental verifications are all consistent with this idea, making multi-trait interactions a credible mechanism to explain the failure of a virulence reduction strategy, based on the\u00a0introduction of a reduced virulence mutant into a pathogen population."

One can, for example, consider a hypothetical alternative mechanism behind the amplified virulence we observed in mixed strain infections. While the invertase mutant is less virulent alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), the mutant might be able to use the metabolic energy saved from not producing invertase to increase its relative fitness, for example to fuel production of alternative virulence factors when co-infecting with the invertase-producing strain. However, this is very challenging to verify experimentally. Contrary to this scenario, the mechanism we propose has been successfully tested in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Specifically, we recover the synergy between invertase producers and non-producers when there is an interaction between public good production and a rate-efficiency trade off (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). When we removed the interaction between these traits, this synergy was lost (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b\u2013d</a>)."

Moreover, pathogenic bacteria employ multiple social traits such as secretion of extracellular signaling molecules responsible for the production and secretion of virulence related proteins (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pirhonen et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lee and Lee, 2010</a>).

Each treatment was inoculated onto an individual rice plant and only a single leaf per plant was infected (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). This was performed according to a previously described protocol (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jia et al., 2003</a>), with the following modifications. Leaves of 21-day-old seedlings of rice cultivar CO39 were inoculated using intact seedlings because detached leaves may trigger defence responses and inhibit sink induction at infection sites and thus nutrient acquisition by the pathogen. Each disease patch was initiated by inoculation with a 20 \u00b5L suspension of 5\u00d710<sup>4</sup> conidia.mL<sup>\u22121</sup> in 0.2% (w/v) gelatine. The inoculum concentration was chosen because it was sufficient to facilitate the full disease cycle to be completed, such that the ability to cause disease could be accurately measured based on sporulation from the disease lesion. The inoculum level resembles that which would occur under disease epidemic conditions, as each disease lesion typically generates 20,000\u201350,000 spores per day in severe rice blast infections (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wilson and Talbot, 2009</a>).

The mutant may now even have more energy available (since it is not making the invertase) to fuel its virulence, than the wildtype. This may increase the overall virulence \u2013 in principle independent from food competition \u2013 and also in a frequency dependent manner.
