Yet, it is unclear how the 5\u2019nuclease mechanisms of DNA distortion and protein ordering robustly mediate efficient and accurate substrate recognition and catalytic selectivity. Here, single-molecule sub-millisecond and millisecond analyses of FEN1 reveal a protein-DNA induced-fit mechanism that efficiently verifies substrate and suppresses off-target cleavage. FEN1 sculpts DNA with diffusion-limited kinetics to test DNA substrate. This DNA distortion mutually \u2018locks\u2019 protein and DNA conformation and enables substrate verification with extreme precision. Strikingly, FEN1 never misses cleavage of its cognate substrate while blocking probable formation of catalytically competent interactions with noncognate substrates and fostering their pre-incision dissociation. These findings establish FEN1 has practically perfect precision and that separate control of induced-fit substrate recognition sets up the catalytic selectivity of the nuclease active site for genome stability."

Yet, it is unclear how the 5\u2019nuclease mechanisms of DNA distortion and protein ordering robustly mediate efficient and accurate substrate recognition and catalytic selectivity. Here, single-molecule sub-millisecond and millisecond analyses of FEN1 reveal a protein-DNA induced-fit mechanism that efficiently verifies substrate and suppresses off-target cleavage. FEN1 sculpts DNA with diffusion-limited kinetics to test DNA substrate. This DNA distortion mutually \u2018locks\u2019 protein and DNA conformation and enables substrate verification with extreme precision. Strikingly, FEN1 never misses cleavage of its cognate substrate while blocking probable formation of catalytically competent interactions with noncognate substrates and fostering their pre-incision dissociation. These findings establish FEN1 has practically perfect precision and that separate control of induced-fit substrate recognition sets up the catalytic selectivity of the nuclease active site for genome stability."

                        "text": "Biologically-critical, structure-specific 5\u2019nucleases are highly conserved endo- or exo-nucleases that hydrolyze phosphodiester bonds that are one nucleotide into the 5\u2019end of single-stranded(ss)/double-stranded(ds)-DNA junctions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), including nicks, gaps, flaps, bubbles and four-way junctions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balakrishnan and Bambara, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Finger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tsutakawa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tsutakawa and Tainer, 2012</a>). This conserved cleavage site despite diverse structures operates by uniformly binding to a bent junction to place the scissile phosphate near the active site (<a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Orans et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Yet, the mechanism underlying this specificity remains unclear including the question of whether 5\u2019nucleases actively distort the DNA or selectively bind to a DNA that bends spontaneously (<a href=\"#bib11\">Craggs et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sobhy et al., 2013</a>). Such mechanistic knowledge not only pertains to biological understanding but also to strategies for the design of specific inhibitors as potential cancer drugs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Exell et al., 2016</a>). Catalysis is proposed to require changes in the protein conformation that assembles the active site (<a href=\"#bib13\">Devos et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Orans et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sakurai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>) and movement of the scissile phosphate closer to the catalytic metals (<a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Orans et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>). Although possible steps in the substrate selection and cleaving process have been described (<a href=\"#bib13\">Devos et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Orans et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sakurai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>), much of the control mechanisms by DNA and protein conformational changes that lead to exquisite catalytic selectivity and efficiency remain controversial and largely undetermined."

                        "text": "Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) and its substrate and product complexes provide a prototypic system for unveiling the extreme catalytic selectivity of structure-specific 5\u2019nucleases. Whereas sequence-based specificity partially explains the secret of replication fidelity, key information is missing about the basis for the structure-based excision required at more than 10 million Okazaki fragment sites during human DNA replication. Strikingly, FEN1 maintains exquisite specificity with extreme efficiency that enhances the hydrolysis rate of target phosphodiester bonds by\u00a0~10<sup>17</sup>, and in vitro reaction rates resemble those of enzyme-substrate encounters (<a href=\"#bib16\">Finger et al., 2009</a>). FEN1 recognizes dsDNA bearing a double-flap (DF) nick junction consisting of short ssDNA or ssRNA 5\u2019flaps and strictly one nucleotide (nt) ssDNA 3\u2019flap (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Finger et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kao et al., 2002</a>). DF intermediates are produced during Okazaki fragment synthesis on the lagging strand and during long-patch base excision repair (<a href=\"#bib17\">Garg et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2005</a>). Mutations that reduce FEN1 expression or alter its activity are linked to cancers and genetic diseases (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balakrishnan and Bambara, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Henneke et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kucherlapati et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zheng et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2011</a>). In cells, the 5\u2019flap is complementary to the template strand, enabling the junction to equilibrate and form a single nt 3\u2019flap (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Upon 5\u2019flap cleavage, the 3\u2019flap complements the newly unpaired template base to create a DNA ligase 1 sealable nick (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). FEN1 contacts duplex DNA from both sides of the flap junction through a 100\u00b0 bend stabilized by the interaction of the superfamily-conserved hydrophobic wedge with the junction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>). A superfamily-conserved helical gateway covered by a unique FEN1 helical cap forms a narrow cavity at the DNA junction. This gateway is suitable to select for threading ss 5\u2019flaps with a free end (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gloor et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Patel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sobhy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>). Alternatively, clamping the 5\u2019flap away from the active site is a proposed selection mechanism (<a href=\"#bib36\">Orans et al., 2011</a>). A small cavity makes contacts with the 3\u2019flap and may impose specificity for the single nt 3\u2019flap (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Part of the cap-helical gateway, which contains catalytically indispensable residues, and the 3\u2019flap-binding pocket appear disordered without DNA (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sakurai et al., 2005</a>), but it is ordered when bound to the 3\u2019flap (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chapados et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>), suggesting DNA-induced ordering of the cap-helical gateway. Comparison of substrate and product complexes shows that the scissile phosphate nucleotide is fully paired at the nick junction and away from the active site\u2019s metal ions, suggesting that unpairing flanking nucleotides may move ssDNA into the active site (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>)."

To define the mechanism for this catalytic efficiency and selectivity, we used single-molecule (sm)FRET at a millisecond to sub-millisecond temporal resolution to simultaneously measure in real time DNA conformational changes and catalysis when FEN1 encounters cognate or noncognate flap substrates as well as when the disorder-to-order transition or the active site is perturbed."

To determine which is the case for FEN1, we started by establishing the conformational state of DF substrates alone using an ideal non-equilibrated (NonEQ) DF substrate containing 6 nt ssDNA 5\u2019flap and 1 nt ssDNA 3\u2019flap primers with no complementarity with the template strand (NonEQ DF-6,1). DNA bending was monitored by placing an Alexa Fluor-647 acceptor 12 nt into the upstream dsDNA and a Cy3 donor at the 5\u2019flap end (NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>Flap</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) or 15 nt into the downstream dsDNA (NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>dsDNA</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The substrates contained biotin to allow for immobilization on a polyethylene glycol-coated coverslip via biotin-NeutrAvidin linkage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>).

The conformer of the duplex arms of the substrate was insensitive to variation in the concentration of divalent metal ions (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>), type of metal ion (Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus Ca<sup>2+</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>) or 5\u2019flap length (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). The flap-labeling scheme was sensitive to variation in the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration when the 5\u2019flap length exceeded 6 nt (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). This could explain why previous work suggested that a double-flap substrate is a\u00a0dynamic structure (<a href=\"#bib11\">Craggs et al., 2014</a>). To test for short-lived alternative conformers, we used confocal-based smFRET to increase the temporal resolution to 5 ms on surface-immobilized DNA and to sub-ms on freely diffusing DNA in solution. Importantly, we found that substrate remained as a single conformer (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). Potential mean force molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that extended DNA (~165\u00b0) was the most energetically favorable conformer in DF-6,1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). Base stacking at the nick junction and between the 3\u2019flap base and the first base on the 5\u2019flap stabilized this extended conformer (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The energetic cost required to bend the DNA up to\u00a0~140\u00b0 was low (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) and similar to that in dsDNA (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sharma et al., 2013</a>). This was followed by a rapid increase in the energy required to surpass a significant barrier of\u00a0~14 kcal/mole to break the base stacking and bend the DNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). These data suggest that DF substrate remains in an extended form that must be actively bent."

The reduced stability of the bent conformer in the equilibrated substrate suggests that a bound 3\u2019flap could dissociate from the 3\u2019flap-binding pocket. The dissociated 3\u2019flap in the equilibrated substrate would pair with the template strand before FEN1 could rebind it while in the non-equilibrated substrate it would remain available for rebinding FEN1. Dwell time analysis of the bent (\u03c4<sub>bending</sub>) and unbent (\u03c4<sub>unbending</sub>) states at increasing FEN1 concentrations indicated that the apparent first-order rate constant for DNA bending (<i>k<sub>bending</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a01/\u03c4<sub>bending</sub>) increased linearly while that for DNA unbending (<i>k<sub>unbending</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a01/\u03c4<sub>unbending</sub>) remained constant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>).

Time traces indicated that FEN1 always bent NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>Flap</sub> before cleaving the Cy3-containing 5\u2019flap; remarkably every DNA bending event led to a successful cleavage reaction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We confirmed DNA bending before cleavage by the clear anti-correlated change in the donor and acceptor intensities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Direct comparison of donor fluorescence in the presence of FEN1 and either Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions indicated that there is a strong correlation between the loss of donor particles and the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> that coincided with the introduction of FEN1 into the flow cell (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). This confirms that the loss of donor particles is due to 5\u2019flap cleavage and not due to donor photobleaching. Analysis of FRET values before cleavage from individual time traces showed that FEN1 cleaved NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>Flap</sub> from a fully bent state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and remained bent for 160\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 ms prior to cleavage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). FEN1 cleavage generates two products: 5\u2019flap ssDNA and nicked dsDNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Previous studies demonstrated that excess nicked dsDNA but not 5\u2019flap ssDNA influences FEN1 activity, which suggests that only nicked dsDNA is a competitive inhibitor of FEN1 release (<a href=\"#bib16\">Finger et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tarantino et al., 2015</a>). Consistent with these findings, we also observed that the lag time before cleavage is not influenced by the presence of excess 5\u2019flap ssDNA (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Furthermore, SPR showed only residual transient binding of FEN1 to ssDNA at concentrations that were orders of magnitude above <i>K<sub>d-bending</sub></i> of DF-6,1 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Our single-molecule cleavage measurement is not inhibited by lack of 5\u2019flap ssDNA product release. Therefore single-turnover <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> (<i>k<sub>STO</sub></i>) could be determined directly from the lag time prior to cleavage (<i>k<sub>STO</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a01/\u03c4<sub>before cleavage</sub>). However, since 5\u2019flap release would still contribute to the dwell time before cleavage, our single turnover should be treated as an apparent value. Notably, our <i>k<sub>STO</sub></i> (6.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) was comparable to that determined by bulk cleavage assays (<i>k<sub>STO</sub></i> 12.3 s<sup>\u22121</sup>\u2212&gt;5 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Algasaier et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Stodola and Burgers, 2016</a>), with the slight difference explained by the lower reaction temperature in the single molecule assays. The diffusion-limited rates of DNA bending and cleavage before protein dissociation provide direct evidence that the reaction of FEN1 on a cognate substrate is limited by encounters between the enzyme and the substrate."

We reasoned that these steps likely include 3\u2019flap-induced disorder-to-order transitioning and cleavage chemistry. To test this idea, we employed glycerol and sucrose as low-molecular-weight viscogen to slow any local protein conformational change that mediates catalysis and/or product release. Increasing glycerol concentration decreased <i>k<sub>STO</sub></i> linearly with a slope of 1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>); a similar effect was observed with sucrose (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Yet, <i>k<sub>STO</sub></i> was unaffected by polyethylene glycol-8000, a high-molecular-weight viscogen that is too large to interfere with local protein conformational changes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). <i>k<sub>STO</sub></i> is not influenced by 5\u2019flap ssDNA product release, suggesting that 3\u2019flap-induced protein ordering is a terminal step to verify the substrate before incision. The shape of the histograms in the presence of viscogen however remains a rise and decay (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), in contrast to the prediction of collapsing into a single exponential decay should protein-ordering acts in a single rate-limiting step. This suggests that the 3\u2019flap-induced protein ordering is likely involves multistep processes that are being slowed down by the presence of viscogen and/or these multisteps control different rate-limiting steps during catalysis such as DNA unpairing and/or DNA shifting into the active site. Biologically relevant, the cleavage behavior from the first DNA bending and the <i>k<sub>STO</sub></i> were similar whether there was a deliberate mispaired 3\u2019flap (NonEQ DF-6,1; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) or an equilibrating 3\u2019flap (EQ DF-6,1; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), consistent with bulk cleavage reactions (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tarantino et al., 2015</a>)."

The equilibrated junction may exist as a single 5\u2019flap that requires active molding by FEN1 into a double 5\u2019- and 3\u2019-flap or as a DF with a readily available 3\u2019flap for FEN1 capturing. To address this, we started by investigating the requirement of having a preformed 3\u2019flap for inducing DNA bending. Removal of the 3\u2019flap from NonEQ DF while maintaining its 5\u2019flap (a substrate termed single flap (SF)) decreased FEN1 cleavage activity by 34 fold (<a href=\"#bib16\">Finger et al., 2009</a>). Time traces on surface-immobilized SF-6,0<sub>Flap</sub> accessed at 5 ms using confocal-based smFRET showed that FEN1 actively bent SF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The \u03c4<sub>bending</sub> was markedly reduced to\u00a0~43 ms (<i>k<sub>off-unbending</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a023.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) in contrast to that of the stable bent conformer in NonEQ DF-6,1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). However, the <i>k<sub>on-bending</sub></i> remained limited by diffusion and similar to that of EQ DF-6,1<sub>dsDNA</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). <i>K<sub>d-bending</sub></i> was 50-fold higher than for NonEQ DF-6,1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), consistent with that observed from confocal-based smFRET with burst analysis of freely diffusing SF-6,0<sub>dsDNA</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>) and the markedly increased <i>K<sub>d-binding</sub></i> by SPR (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>).

The nick position relative to the donor and acceptor would differ by one base pair if EQ DF-6,1<sub>dsDNA</sub> existed in a SF form compared to that in NonEQ DF-6,1<sub>dsDNA</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To test possible threading and its coordination with the 3\u2019flap-induced protein ordering, we used a modification that prevented 5\u2019flap threading. Blocking the threading by immobilizing a DF substrate through a biotin attached at the end of a 30 nt ssDNA 5\u2019flap (termed DF-30,1<sub>blocked-dsDNA</sub>) impaired DNA bending to comparable <i>K<sub>d-bending</sub></i> and <i>k<sub>off-unbending</sub></i> of SF-6,0 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), consistent with the markedly reduced <i>K<sub>d-binding</sub></i> captured by SPR (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>).

This significant DNA distortion was masked in our previous experiment that relied on a flap labeling scheme to infer to the geometry of the blocked-threaded complex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sobhy et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, our new results indicate that initial DNA bending by FEN1 did not require threading, but that full bending required 5\u2019flaps, if present, to be able to thread. The increased <i>K<sub>d-bending</sub></i> of the unthreaded substrate upon removal of its 3\u2019flap (SF-30,0<sub>blocked-dsDNA</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) indicates that 3\u2019flap binding did not require 5\u2019flap threading.

In SF-6,0, the lifetime of the bent conformer was\u00a0~3.5 fold shorter than the required lag time prior to cleaving the cognate substrate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Traces of single-molecule cleavage showed that SF-6,0 underwent multiple cycles of DNA bending and unbending before a successful DNA bending event led to 5\u2019flap cleavage (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). These abortive DNA bending events are masked in bulk cleavage assays, which leads to underestimation of both <i>k<sub>STO</sub></i> and the accuracy of FEN1 cleavage. Following the FEN1 cleavage reaction at the single-molecule level clearly leads to additional information. Similar results were observed in the cleavage of DF-6,1 by FEN1-R47A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These results show that destabilizing the bent DNA intermediate to rates that are limiting for catalysis reduces the probability of assembling catalytically competent active sites."

The 3\u2019flap-induced protein ordering could act once per DNA bending event, locking the DNA into either a catalytically competent or incompetent conformation. In this mechanism, the <i>k<sub>STO</sub></i> after DNA bending should be similar between cognate and noncognate substrates regardless of whether or not the lifetime of the bent conformer is limiting. Alternatively, the protein could lock the DNA into a bent conformer and go through multiple cycles of disorder-to-order transitioning to search for a catalytically competent conformation of protein and DNA. In this mechanism, the <i>k<sub>STO</sub></i> would be slower for noncognate substrates, particularly under conditions when the lifetime of the bent conformer exceeded that required for cleavage. We found that the <i>k<sub>STO</sub></i> of FEN1 in all tested noncognate substrates was similar and comparable to that in the cognate substrate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This indicates that the 3\u2019flap-induced protein ordering locked the DNA into either a catalytically competent conformation to be immediately incised or into an incompetent conformation that led to immediate DNA release from the bent conformation. Directly observing FEN1 conformation will lead to further understanding on how it prevents cleavage in noncognate substrates."

We therefore tested the role of key active-site residues. Mutating individual gateway residues Y40, K93, R100 or one of the metal-coordinating aspartic acidic residues (D181) to alanine markedly reduced the bent conformer\u2019s stability (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These results revealed a direct role for active-site residues in stabilizing the bent DNA conformer. Interestingly, <i>k<sub>on-bending</sub></i> was reduced up to 11 fold in gateway mutants, with R100 and to a lesser extent Y40 being critical residues (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This result is surprising, given that these gateway residues appear to be disordered prior to DNA binding. Thus, active-site residues evidently contribute to active positioning of the junction while the 5\u2019flap is being threaded through the unstructured cap-helical gateway. Moreover, D181A had only a minor effect on <i>k<sub>on-bending</sub></i>, implying that the metal ions do not interact with the phosphates during DNA bending and 5\u2019flap threading. Importantly, this could provide a mechanism that protects the 5\u2019flap from nonspecific cleavage."

In this process, FEN1 can differentiate between substrates whose incision is good for the cell (cognate) or toxic (noncognate) even if these substrates have small differences in their binding affinities. Active DNA bending does not create a significant energy barrier as evident by diffusion-limited on-rates in FEN1 and EXO1. We propose that different members of the 5\u2019nuclease family share similar DNA-bending-induced disorder-to-order transitioning but differ in the mechanisms that couple this transitioning with active-site assembly. In FEN1, the coupling of protein transitions of the 3\u2019flap-binding pocket and the 5\u2019flap-binding helical gateway with DNA sculpting uncovers how dynamic protein segments are critical contributors to substrate binding and catalytic selection."

The stochastic cleavage behavior of noncognate substrates after multiple cycles of DNA bending and dissociation of FEN1 has a fundamental bearing on how enzyme specificity is understood. In cases in which an enzyme encounters noncognate substrates and cleaves them after multiple trials, results on substrate specificity from classical biochemical techniques that monitor product formation become misleading. Furthermore, multiple attempts to cleave noncognate substrates are likely to be insignificant inside the cell.

FEN1 cleaves 5\u2019flaps containing RNA, DNA or mismatches of various lengths. We anticipate that long-range DNA-induced conformational coupling could provide a mechanism that enhances flexibility in nuclease substrates. The action of 3\u2019flap-induced protein ordering as a key step that locks the FEN1 interaction with the junction could provide the advantage of limiting the sampling time between the disordered protein form and noncognate substrates that could otherwise lead to nonspecific cleavage. This active site control via a long-range induced-fit mechanism suggests why mutations distant from the FEN1 active site have a dramatic effect on genomic stability and disease states (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sun et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zheng et al., 2007</a>).

The fluorophore lifetime was determined by the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) method. The excitation was carried out at 535 nm and emission was collected at 568 nm using 5 nm bandwidths for the excitation and emission. A longpass filter with 550 nm cut-on was placed on the emission side to prevent scattered light. The instrument response function (IRF) was determined using a colloidal silica suspension. The decay time traces were acquired at 10,000 counts. The measurements were performed at room temperature using the same 5\u2019 flap constructs and buffer composition as in the smFRET experiments. The determination of the lifetimes was done using IRF reconvolution and a multi-exponential decay function incorporated in the FluoFit software package (PicoQuant). The donor lifetime curve was fitted to two-exponential decay. The best fit was selected based on reduced chi-square and randomness of the residuals."

In total, four substrate DNA models (denoted NonEQ DF-6,1, SF-6,0, EQ DF-6,1 and nicked DNA) were generated. A dsDNA 47-mer with sequence d(5\u2019-TGACCGTTGTTTGACGGTCGTGAGGAGGAAAGTTCCTCCTACGGCAG-3\u2019)\u2022d\u2019(5\u2019-CTGCCGTAGGAGGAACTTTCCTCC<b>T(25</b>)<b>C</b>(<b>26</b>)<b>A</b>(<b>27</b>)CGACCGTCAAACAACGGTCA-3\u2019), identical to the one used in the smFRET experiments, was first constructed in a canonical B-DNA conformation with the UCSF CHIMERA program\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib38\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). The model NonEQ DF-6,1 was built by adding 5\u2019 ssDNA flap (5\u2019-TTTTTA-3\u2019) and a single-nucleotide 3\u2019 flap (G-3\u2019) at the junction of the two DNA duplexes (between bases C26 and T25). The SF-6,0 and EQ DF-6,1 models were constructed by adding 5\u2019 flap ssDNA (5\u2019-TTTTA-3\u2019) at base C26 and 5\u2019 flap ssDNA (5\u2019-TTTTAC-3\u2019) at base A27, respectively. Each system was solvated with TIP3P water (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jorgensen and Jenson, 1998</a>) with a minimum distance of 15.0 \u00c5 from the DNA to the edge of the periodic simulation box. The systems were then neutralized by the addition of Na<sup>+</sup> counterions. Additionally, 100 mM NaCl concentration was introduced to mimic physiological conditions. First, the water and ions were subjected to 3000 steps of steepest descent and 1500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization while restraining all DNA atoms with a force constant of 2 kcal/mol \u00c5<sup>2</sup>. All restraints were then released. The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method (<a href=\"#bib12\">Darden et al., 1993</a>) was used to treat the long-range electrostatic interactions. The cutoff for non-bonded interactions was set to 10 \u00c5. All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm. We imposed a 1-fs simulation time step during equilibration. The temperature of the simulated systems was then gradually increased to 300 K over 50 ps in the NVT ensemble. Subsequently, equilibration dynamics was carried out in the NPT ensemble (p=1 atm and T\u00a0=\u00a0300 K) for an additional 50 ns. Then, 800-ns production runs were carried out for each simulation system in the isothermal isobaric ensemble (p=1 atm and T\u00a0=\u00a0300 K). We utilized hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) as a method to increase the simulation time step to 4 fs during the production runs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hopkins et al., 2015</a>). The substrate-bending angle for each system was defined and computed as described in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>.

ABF is a widely used enhanced sampling approach, which computes average forces along a predefined reaction coordinate (RC) and then applies an adaptive biasing potential to flatten the underlying free energy landscape. As a result, all points along the RC can be sampled efficiently. In our case, the RC was defined as the bending angle between the two-dsDNA fragments of the substrate. The exact definitions of the two vectors and the fragments are shown in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>."

This simulation transformed the DNA from a straight conformation (bending angle of\u00a0~180\u00b0) to the bent conformation observed in the FEN1/DNA complex (bending angle of\u00a0~90\u00b0). The target configuration of the bent DNA was directly taken from the FEN1/DNA X-ray structure 3Q8L (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>). In the ABF simulations, the reaction coordinate was segmented into nine discrete windows with a confining wall potential (<i>k</i>\u00a0=\u00a050 kcal/mol) placed at the boundaries. Snapshots collected from the TMD trajectory were used to seed the ABF windows. Each window was further subdivided into small 0.2<sup>0</sup> bins. Force averages were then accumulated into the bins and continuously updated in the course of the ABF simulation. Cancellation of the averaged forces through the gradual introduction of an adaptive bias led to enhanced sampling and overcoming of energy barriers along the RC. Since the instantaneous forces may fluctuate considerably, the application the adaptive bias was delayed until an adequate number of force samples was collected (2000 samples). PMF reconstruction was then accomplished by integration of the averaged forces from the bins."

In particular, the authors focus on the classical question of induced fit or conformational selection as the two main models that describe recognition of a substrate and productive interaction with it. A series of elegant single-molecule experiments are described that provide great detail of the kinetic steps underlying flap cleavage with a number of different cognate and noncognate substrates. The main conclusion is that both protein and DNA undergo conformational changes upon binding to ensure great selectivity and specificity in enzymatic activity. The work is comprehensive and detailed, and other complementary tools such as MD simulations, ensemble time resolved FRET, biochemical cleavage assays and surface plasmon resonance are employed to support their findings and interpretations. The results are intriguing and the findings are very relevant to the field, specifically for the area of DNA replication/ repair and for the broader area of enzymology. However, a number of important arguments and conclusions in the manuscript are not backed up by the data shown. Discrimination between the different models and scenarios requires high accuracy in the quantitative determination of FRET levels, transition rates etc. While the numbers in the manuscript seem to make sense, the underlying raw data, distributions, and analyses to arrive at these numbers are either not shown or not adequately explained.

This labeling scheme showed that blocking 5\u2019flap threading by introducing biotin/streptavidin moiety on the 5\u2019flap resulted in minor change in FRET compare to that when threading was allowed. Indeed this experiment is reproducible under optimal K<sub>d-bending</sub> (data not shown). Sobhy et al. therefore proposed that 5\u2019flap threading is strictly required for inducing DNA bending and consequently that DNA bending occurs at the conclusion of substrate recognition; the paragraph that is highlighted by the reviewers. In the current study, we relied on the internal-labeling scheme that directly reports on the geometry of the duplex DNA. This labeling scheme led to a different result, showing significant distortion of the duplex DNA when the 5\u2019flap threading process was blocked. However, this distortion was still less than that observed when 5\u2019flap threading was allowed. We also found that altering residues in the gateway decreased the on rate of DNA bending. Although these new results also suggest that 5\u2019flap threading is required for proper distortion of the DNA, as originally proposed by Sobhy et al., the significant DNA bending reported in the current study made it difficult to conclusively rule out the possibilities that FEN1 might be threading the 5\u2019flap after it significantly bends the DNA or while it bends the DNA. These results advance our knowledge on the relationship between 5\u2019flap threading and DNA bending but they also highlight the complexity in understanding the exact timing mechanism of 5\u2019flap threading relative to DNA bending. In the current study, we also performed kinetic analysis of on- and off-rates on non-cognate substrates, combined with high temporal resolution FRET measurements, and showed that FEN1 was able to bend both cognate and noncognate substrates but displayed remarkable selectivity to stabilize the bent conformer for cognate substrate. These results together with the significant distortion of the DNA upon blocking 5\u2019flap threading are more consistent with a model that FEN1 bends the DNA and uses it to interrogate the features of the substrate. In the revised manuscript, we added discussion linking the findings on 5\u2019flap recognition from the flap-labeling scheme in Sobhy et al. with the internal-labeling scheme in the current study. We also added the following conclusion paragraph that comments on the proposed models in both studies."

They further showed that FEN1 stabilizes the cognate substrate through remarkable selectivity for its key features of a fully paired nick junction, a 3\u2019flap and a 5\u2019flap while promoting the dissociation of noncognate substrates. Our observation of FEN1\u2019s ability to significantly bend the DNA in the blocked-threaded complex challenges our previous conclusion that 5\u2019flap threading is strictly required to induce DNA bending (Sobhy et al., 2013).

If we assume that the distribution of the lag time should reflect the rate-limiting 3\u2019flap-induced conformational changes step, it is still possible that the underlying distribution of conformational changes upon addition of viscogen may become a more complex distribution in itself. This can be understood from a simple diffusion model where the rate of folding is inversely proportional to the solution viscosity. Assuming that without viscogen, the conformational change was distributed exponentially, it can be argued that upon addition of viscogen, the conformational changes would assume multi-exponential behavior due to different degree of friction provided to different residues in the protein by the viscogen and thus showing apparent multi-exponential steps in the dwell times of cleavage. In fact, if we plot the standard deviation of the dwell time vs viscosity, we found a near linear relationship (a new supplementary <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), as would be predicted by a simple diffusion model. In simple terms this could imply that when adding viscogen, the energy bounds of folding get larger causing the distribution of individual rates of protein folding to show a greater standard distribution among themselves.

When this step slows down, the mean dwell time should become longer and this indeed what we observed experimentally in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>. The standard deviations in the absence or presence of different glycerol concentrations were in the range of 60-70% of their mean, suggesting that the shape of the histograms is similar and that the number of rate limiting steps did not increase in presence of viscogen.

One possibility is that there are multiple distinct steps of conformational changes in this reaction that will slow down when the viscosity of the solution increases.

If this is the case, all the steps will slow down when the viscosity of the solution increases, and therefore, overall reaction rate will decrease while the rise-and-decay shape of the histogram will remain the same. We therefore believe the statement in the original manuscript that 3\u2019flap-induced protein ordering is the probable rate-limiting step is incorrect.
