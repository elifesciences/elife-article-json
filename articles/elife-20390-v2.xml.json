The UPR is activated by disruption of the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum, otherwise known as \u2018ER stress\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>). Unremitted ER stress and/or a dysregulated UPR appear to contribute to hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis (<a href=\"#bib39\">Malhi and Kaufman, 2011</a>), atherosclerosis (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zhou and Tabas, 2013</a>), colitis and inflammatory bowel disease (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kaser et al., 2013</a>), hypertension (<a href=\"#bib74\">Young and Davisson, 2015</a>), and many others. As an organelle that carries out several essential cellular processes (protein processing, calcium storage, lipogenesis, certain metabolic steps, etc.) and that is physically and functionally intertwined with many other critical cellular pathways, the ER is sensitive to a range of diverse stimuli. For example, ER stress is observed in the livers of obese mice (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ozcan et al., 2004</a>), and this response has been attributed to an excess load of nascent client proteins in the organelle due to nutrient-mediated stimulation of mTOR activity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ozcan et al., 2008</a>). Other physiological stimuli that elicit ER stress include nutritional status and the activity of metabolic pathways (<a href=\"#bib44\">Oyadomari et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tyra et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shao et al., 2014</a>), differentiation cues (<a href=\"#bib28\">Iwakoshi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">van Anken et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2005</a>), inflammatory signals (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hotamisligil, 2010</a>), and many others. While the UPR is capable of responding to excessive ER stress by initiating cell death cascades (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sano and Reed, 2013</a>), chronic stress is instead likely to result not in cell death (at least not for most cells, most of the time), but instead in a persistent burden on ER function that must be accommodated by the UPR. And yet, for many chronic diseases in which ER stress is implicated, it is not clear whether disease results from a UPR that becomes progressively dysregulated and thus responds <i>inappropriately</i>; or whether the UPR becomes progressively neutered and simply becomes increasingly <i>unresponsive</i>."

The inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) pathway results in both the production of the XBP1 transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib72\">Yoshida et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Calfon et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 2002</a>) and the degradation of ER-associated mRNAs in a process known as Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay via the IRE1 endonuclease activity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hollien et al., 2009</a>). The PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) stimulates production of the ATF4 transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib23\">Harding et al., 2000</a>) and also transiently reduces ER protein load by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Shi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Harding et al., 1999</a>). ATF6 (comprising both \u03b1 and \u03b2 paralogs) initiates the third pathway when ATF6 is itself cleaved by regulated intramembrane proteolysis in the Golgi, liberating a transcriptionally active N-terminal fragment (<a href=\"#bib70\">Ye et al., 2000</a>). These pathways are all robustly activated by acute exposure of cells to high doses of ER stress-inducing drugs, which is an effective tool for understanding what the system is capable of but not as effective for understanding how the cellular response to chronic stress differs from these canonical pathways."

Further, animal models of chronic diseases such as those associated with obesity tend to influence innumerable cellular pathways and make it difficult to isolate the effects of ER stress per se from the many other confounding factors."

In doing so, we hoped to be able to understand how the UPR responds to chronic stress, divorced from the confounding influences of chronic diseases on other cellular pathways. Toward this end, we used tunicamycin (TM) to induce ER stress in vivo; TM blocks N-linked glycosylation, an ER-specific protein modification. It has few known off-target effects, most prominently targets the kidneys and the liver, and is not lethal in wild-type animals at even relatively high doses (<a href=\"#bib15\">Foufelle and Fromenty, 2016</a>). Its effects on the liver can also be mimicked, albeit less readily, by other agents that elicit ER stress in that organ (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rutkowski et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chikka et al., 2013</a>), further justifying its use here. Following an approach analogous to one we described previously in cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rutkowski et al., 2006</a>), we looked for a dose of TM that was capable of inducing the UPR, but that was significantly less toxic than the common experimental dose of 1 mg/kg\u2014which is known to elicit hepatocellular death and inflammation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Foufelle and Fromenty, 2016</a>). Using qRT-PCR to detect changes in expression of the UPR sentinel genes <i>Hspa5</i> (encoding BiP) and <i>Ddit3</i> (encoding CHOP), we found that doses of TM below 0.1 mg/kg were capable of eliciting attenuated UPR activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

These vacuoles were abundant in animals administered a single dose of 0.025 mg/kg TM, but, remarkably, were absent by the end of the fifth day of challenge. Other than these changes, there were few signs of gross liver damage such as necrosis or fibrosis (data not shown). Thus, at least by these histological criteria, animals are capable of maintaining liver function in the face of ongoing stress. The apparent normalization of liver histology could be explained if animals became resistant to TM over time. However, persistent underglycosylation of the ER-resident glycoprotrein TRAP\u03b1 at day five confirmed that the drug remained active upon repeated dosing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

One of the commonalities among the genes that were suppressed below basal levels (<i>Hspa5</i>, <i>Herpud1</i>, <i>Hsp90b1</i>) is that each has been identified as a target of the ATF6\u03b1 pathway of the UPR (<a href=\"#bib72\">Yoshida et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yamamoto et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wu et al., 2007</a>).

This result was mirrored in a chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment.

Confirming this prediction, we found that the basal expression of <i>Hspa5</i> in animals lacking ATF6\u03b1 was reduced by approximately 50 percent relative to wild-type animals, and that chronic stress then had no further effect on <i>Hspa5</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

This attenuation could come about in either of two ways. One possibility is that some fundamental feature of chronic stress renders the UPR increasingly refractory. This means that after 5 days of activation by successive bouts of stress the UPR would no longer be responsive; this is a \u2018preconditioning\u2019 model. The other possibility is an \u2018augmented deactivation\u2019 model in which the UPR is activated in full or nearly so upon each exposure to stress, but the temporal dynamics of its activation and resolution become progressively altered.

Rather than following the production of UPR-regulated transcription factors as in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, we instead monitored activation of the UPR sensor IRE1\u03b1, which serves as a direct, robust, and sensitive readout for the capacity of the UPR to be activated. IRE1\u03b1 was monitored using <i>Xbp1</i> mRNA splicing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This experiment demonstrated that the UPR remained essentially as stress-responsive on the fifth day as on the first; splicing of <i>Xbp1</i> 8 hr after the first injection and 8 hr after the fifth were induced to comparable levels. Supporting the idea that the UPR remained responsive, repeated TM treatment continued to induce short-term lipid dysregulation, as evidenced by abundant cytoplasmic vacuoles in D5-8h livers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Yet the <i>deactivation</i> of the UPR, or at least the <i>Xbp1</i> splicing activity of IRE1\u03b1, proceeded more rapidly on day five than on day 1; substantial <i>Xbp1</i> splicing was seen 14 hr after the first injection but not 14 hr after the fifth (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Likewise, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, lipid dysregulation was observed 24 hr after the first injection but not 24 hr after the fifth. We also monitored <i>Hspa5</i> mRNA expression over a similar time course, and found that its expression mirrored this pattern\u2014namely, that <i>Hspa5</i> expression was well-induced after both treatments, but that its attenuation proceeded more rapidly in the chronic condition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Similar results were also obtained for <i>Hsp90b1</i> (encoding GRP94) mRNA (not shown). Collectively, our data support the <i>augmented deactivation</i> model described above. Thus, the chronic treatment opens a window into the mechanisms of UPR deactivation, about which relatively little is known since ER stress is usually studied in the context of stresses sufficiently severe as to kill cells."

Computational modeling suggests that mRNAs whose expression is regulated by stimulated degradation should return to basal expression levels much more rapidly than those whose regulation is transcriptional, when both mechanisms are deactivated (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arensdorf et al., 2013b</a>). Thus, this persistence of <i>Bloc1s1</i> and <i>Fn1</i> suppression might suggest that, in contrast to the pathways of transcriptional regulation, RIDD activity persists through the cycles of UPR activation and deactivation that characterize the chronic stress state, even while the <i>Xbp1</i> splicing activity of IRE1\u03b1 is attenuated. Conclusively demonstrating that RIDD is active under these conditions will ultimately require replacement of endogenous IRE1\u03b1 by a form in which the <i>Xbp1</i> splicing and RIDD activities can be separated and modulated (<a href=\"#bib21\">Han et al., 2009</a>). Thus, while the hypothesis that RIDD activity reduces the expression of <i>Hspa5</i> and other genes is an appealing possible mechanism, other degradative pathways are possible."

Thus, we examined gene expression in <i>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></i> or <i>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></i> mice, which are obese due to mutations in leptin or the leptin receptor, respectively, that compromise appetite control and lead to overfeeding (<a href=\"#bib7\">Campfield et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Halaas et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pelleymounter et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 1996</a>). We observed a similar pattern of gene regulation in these animals as in animals treated with chronic TM; <i>Hspa5</i> and <i>Hsp90b1</i> were both significantly suppressed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), while other UPR targets were not suppressed (and, indeed, appeared to be upregulated; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). In addition, again mirroring the results seen in TM-treated animals, expression of <i>Bloc1s1</i> was reduced in <i>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></i> mice and potentially in <i>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></i> mice as well, and <i>Fn1</i> was strongly suppressed in both (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). These results suggest that suppression of the mRNA expression of <i>Hspa5</i> and <i>Hsp90b1</i> characterizes both pharmacological and dietary models of chronic stress. Though they do not yet establish that suppression proceeds by the same mechanism in both, they highlight the potential for the experimental induction of chronic ER stress to be a useful tool for understanding how gene regulatory patterns are altered by chronic physiological stresses."

In the basal (i.e., nominally \u2018unstressed\u2019) state, activation of ATF6\u03b1 contributes to the expression of <i>Hspa5</i> mRNA. We arrive at this conclusion because expression of <i>Hspa5</i> was diminished in the absence of ATF6\u03b1 even without an exogenous stress (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This finding implies that normal physiological function in the liver entails periods of UPR activation\u2014perhaps not surprisingly, given that feeding itself activates the UPR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). BiP is one of the most abundant proteins in the ER lumen (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gething, 1999</a>), and other non-stress-dependent mechanisms contribute to its basal regulation as well (<a href=\"#bib52\">Resendez et al., 1988</a>). Upon exposure to a conventional ER stress, all three limbs of the UPR are activated (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rutkowski et al., 2006</a>), leading to robust production of stress-specific target transcripts such as <i>Ddit3 (Chop)</i>, as well as augmentation of transcripts encoding ER chaperones, such as <i>Hspa5</i> and <i>Hsp90b1 (Grp94)</i>. The attendant improvement of ER protein folding then presents a problem for the cell: how to avoid overproduction of UPR targets. As the UPR stress-sensing molecules become deactivated, naturally labile factors such as CHOP (both mRNA and protein) are readily lost (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rutkowski et al., 2006</a>). However, ER chaperones such as BiP and GRP94 are long-lived at both the protein and mRNA levels (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rutkowski et al., 2006</a>), and continued overproduction of these proteins would presumably greatly tax cellular resources and potentially constitute their own burden on the organelle. Thus, BiP overexpression appears to initiate a negative feedback loop, both suppressing UPR activity (including the basal activity of ATF6\u03b1) and also indirectly stimulating the degradation of its own mRNA. In the context of incidental exposure to stress, or of the low-level stresses that occur during normal physiological function, we presume that this depression of <i>Hspa5</i> mRNA levels is transient. However, during repeated stress, we propose that it constitutes a resetting to a new quasi-stable setpoint for UPR transcriptional regulation."

Originally, the purpose attributed to BiP binding was to hold the stress sensors in a quiescent state and so to play a role in UPR activation. However, the suggestion that at least yeast Ire1p can be activated by direct binding to unfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kimata et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gardner and Walter, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gardner et al., 2013</a>) has cast doubt on this model.

An important caveat is that most agents other than TM that specifically induce ER stress in vitro fail to do so easily or effectively in vivo. While relatively specific in inducing ER stress due to its blockage of N-linked glycosylation, TM also is capable of disrupting carbohydrate metabolism (<a href=\"#bib43\">Olden et al., 1979</a>) and protein palmitoylation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Patterson and Skene, 1995</a>), although whether it does so at the doses used here is unclear. In addition, it is conceivable that the chronic stress phenotype is caused not by the ER stress-inducing effect of TM, but by underglycosylation of some specific key protein. However, we do not favor this alternative explanation in part because the degree of protein underglycosylation under these conditions is relatively modest (e.g., <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), and also because of the ability of BiP overexpression to phenocopy <i>Hspa5</i> downregulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

One difference between the chronic condition on one hand and the steady-state in obese mice on the other is that the latter do not appear to express elevated BiP protein levels (not shown), which at face value seems at odds with the idea that elevated BiP protein is needed to both suppress ATF6\u03b1 and activate or perpetuate RIDD. However, as we have demonstrated, the magnitude of ER stress elicited by feeding is considerably lower than that elicited by tunicamycin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; also compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> with <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), yet also much more repetitive than the once-daily TM challenge. It is plausible that the less robust but more constant stimulus of overfeeding results in modest alterations in expression of BiP protein that have little effect on <i>Hspa5</i> mRNA over the course of meals or days but great effect over the course of months\u2014essentially that small increases in BiP protein levels could produce small decreases in BiP mRNA expression that accumulate over time. It is possible that further moderating the dose of TM and lengthening its extent (from days to weeks/months) would more closely mimic the phenotype observed in obese animals, although this would be experimentally cumbersome. It is also worth noting that the suppression of <i>Hspa5</i> and <i>Hsp90b1</i> mRNAs might be achieved by other mechanisms that suppress ATF6\u03b1 activation while perpetuating RIDD. For instance, it has been reported that ATF6\u03b1 expression is lost in obese animals (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). Along these lines, we observed that <i>Atf6</i> mRNA is also significantly downregulated by chronic stress, albeit not as robustly as <i>Hspa5</i> (not shown), raising the possibility of a positive feedback loop for suppressing <i>Hspa5</i> expression even as BiP protein levels subside. Alternatively, posttranslational modifications that alter BiP\u2019s interactions with its binding partners (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chambers et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Preissler et al., 2015</a>) might also play a role. Ultimately, the clearest way to test whether the mechanism we describe here is at work in obese animals might be to intercross these animals with <i>Atf6</i>-/- animals; as when given repeated TM injections, these animals should have basally suppressed <i>Hspa5</i> mRNA expression even at an early age, but then there should be no further suppression as the animals age and become obese. Even if the mechanism turns out to be entirely distinct, the description here of suppressed expression of <i>Hspa5</i>, and <i>Hsp90b1</i> and potentially elevated RIDD activity in these animals has potential implications for their ability to maintain ongoing ER homeostasis. It is conceivable that an altered UPR \u2018setpoint\u2019 with reduced expression of <i>Hspa5</i> and other UPR mRNA targets could render the animals more sensitive to ER stress-induced cell death and exacerbate the hepatic inflammation associated with obesity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gregor and Hotamisligil, 2011</a>)."

Admittedly, conclusively demonstrating RIDD activity in vivo is challenging; here we have relied on repression of the well-documented RIDD target <i>Bloc1s1</i> as the primary readout for RIDD activity. <i>Bloc1s1</i> expression was repressed in the chronic condition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), upon BiP overexpression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), and in <i>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></i> animals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Phos-tag immunoblotting showed substantial phosphorylation of IRE1\u03b1 only in animals treated with a high acute dose of TM, and antibodies purported to be specific for phospho-IRE1 did not produce bands that were absent in cells lacking IRE1\u03b1 in control experiments (not shown). These limitations made it impossible to directly test whether IRE1\u03b1 remained phosphorylated in the chronic condition. In addition, there is as yet no functional assay for confirming that RIDD is active in vivo. Rather, substrates are generally identified as putative RIDD targets based on an in vitro assay using purified IRE1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hollien et al., 2009</a>). Then, their RIDD dependence is confirmed by their suppression during ER stress in an IRE1\u03b1-dependent XBP1-independent manner. However, <i>Hspa5</i> and <i>Hsp90b1</i> are both also transcriptionally upregulated by XBP1 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2003</a>), which would likely confound analysis of their regulation in animals lacking IRE1\u03b1. In any case, our data hint at a previously unappreciated role for RIDD, which has generally been considered an anti-adaptive signaling mechanism to this point (<a href=\"#bib21\">Han et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lerner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Upton et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Maurel et al., 2014</a>). The purpose of the clearance of ER-resident proteins might not so much be to neuter the organelle and hasten its dysfunction during severe stress (<a href=\"#bib41\">Maurel et al., 2014</a>) as to help turn the response off once stress has been overcome. If RIDD is indeed active under these conditions, such a role could help explain the previously puzzling finding that <i>Hspa5</i> is a potential RIDD target (<a href=\"#bib21\">Han et al., 2009</a>)."

They raise the possibility that this dissociation occurs not necessarily to separate adaptive from apoptotic outputs so much as to separate activation from deactivation. Given that most stresses encountered by most cells most of the time are likely to be mild and transient\u2014such as that encountered by feeding\u2014the death-accelerating function of RIDD might simply be a byproduct of a normal physiological role in restoring the UPR rheostat. Indeed, a parallel can be drawn with the UPR-regulated transcription factor CHOP which, though it clearly promotes cell death during severe stress (<a href=\"#bib78\">Zinszner et al., 1998</a>) also might promote normal cellular function during milder stress both by potentiating the dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Marciniak et al., 2004</a>) and by regulating lipid metabolism (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tyra et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chikka et al., 2013</a>) toward the ultimate improvement of ER function."

This discrepancy points to the existence of other as yet unappreciated factors that influence UPR output in the liver. Indeed, it is now becoming clear that, overlaid atop the structural framework of the canonical UPR lie modulatory pathways for altering UPR sensitivity and output, with potential implications for signaling during chronic stress. These include posttranslational modifications either of the stress sensors\u2014such as S-nitrosylation of IRE1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yang et al., 2015</a>)\u2014or of ER chaperones, such as ADP ribosylation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chambers et al., 2012</a>) or AMPylation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Preissler et al., 2015</a>) of BiP.

Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane. The liver was perfused through the portal vein first with Perfusion Buffer Solution and then with Liver Digest Medium. Formulations were as follows: Liver Perfusion Media: HBSS, no calcium, no magnesium, no phenol red (Life Technologies,\u00a0Carlsbad,\u00a0CA), 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 25 mM HEPES, Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000 U/mL) (Life Technologies) and 0.2% BSA (Research Products International,\u00a0Mt.\u00a0Prospect,\u00a0IL); Liver Digest Media (50 mL for 25g mouse): HBSS, calcium, magnesium, no phenol red (Life Technologies), 0.25 mM HEPES, Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000 U/mL) (Life Technologies), 3.6 mg Trypsin Inhibitor (Sigma,\u00a0St.\u00a0Louis,\u00a0MO), 28 mg Collagenase Type IV (Life Technologies) added fresh. Digest flow rates were 5 mL/min for 5 min for perfusion and 10 min for digest. The liver was then quickly dispersed and filtered through a sterile 100 \u00b5m mesh. Hepatocyte suspensions were then centrifuged at 50x g for 3 min and resuspended to a density of 5\u00d710<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in DMEM. Viable hepatocytes in the pellet were washed three times and then plated on collagen-coated tissue culture plates in DMEM with 10% calf serum and 100 \u00b5g/ml penicillin and streptomycin. After overnight culture, the medium was replaced with F-12 medium containing insulin (10 \u00b5g/ml), dexamethasone (67 ng/ml), triiodothyronine (67.3 ng/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Primary hepatocytes were treated with 5 \u00b5g/mL of TM for 4 hr before addition of ActinomycinD (ActD; Sigma) to 5 \u00b5g/mL. Cells were collected in triplicate 15 min after addition (considered time 0), 2 hr 15m, and 4 hr 15m after treatment. As all in vitro experiments involved primary cells, cells were not mycoplasma tested."

The reason this is of importance is because many disease states have been correlated with chronic ER stress, but the mechanistic and causal relationships between the stress and disease progression have been challenging to dissect. Characterization of an experimentally tractable system is expected to provide the tools and insights to examine the more complex disease situations. The authors use daily low-dose tunicamycin injections as the paradigm, following up their earlier work in cultured cells with a similar strategy. Analysis of liver at different times by a number of methods (histology, stress pathway activation status, transcriptional status, promoter occupancy, etc.) provides a description of what is happening. The primary discovery is that in the chronic state, levels of mRNA for BiP (and some other UPR targets) are suppressed despite the fact that BiP protein is high and the UPR continues to be responsive to each new dose of tunicamycin. Additional experiments indicate that a signature feature of the chronic stress state is a UPR that is comparably responsive, but more rapidly deactivated. It is proposed that the more rapid deactivation is due to the high levels of BiP protein suppressing UPR sensor activity, and that the low levels of BiP mRNA are due to its degradation, possibly by RIDD. Using this information, the authors provide evidence that a model of obesity (which is associated with low-level ER stress in the liver) shows similar signatures."

In addition, new histological images from D1 and D5 timepoints, included in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, further support the idea that the UPR remains responsive but deactivates more rapidly (see below). We have also replaced the original <i>Bloc1s1</i> data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) with a more complete time course to illustrate the contrast between UPR-dependent transcription\u2014which is deactivated more rapidly in the chronic state\u2014and RIDD activity\u2014which appears by the <i>Bloc1s1</i> measure at least to be more persistent in the chronic state.

This is the more relevant comparison and substantiates our point that the chronic condition is qualitatively distinct from the acute condition\u2014i.e., that the chronic condition is not simply an artifact of harvesting at 24h rather than 8h. We have also replaced the ADRP immunostaining shown in original <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> with an ADRP immunoblot, which unambiguously describes the state of lipid accumulation at the D1 and D5 periods (and was necessary due to unforeseen technical issues with ADRP immunostaining that we have been unable to resolve). Together, both the histology and ADRP immunoblotting demonstrate substantial lipid accumulation at D1-24h, which has largely resolved by D5-24h.

However, the ChIP experiments do not offer enough resolution to compare ATF6\u03b1 (or Pol2) binding between the D1-24h and D5-24h conditions\u2014i.e., to conclude that the binding at D5-24h is less than the binding at D1-24h, since both are at or near basal levels. We have altered the text describing <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> to make clearer the goals of these experiments."
