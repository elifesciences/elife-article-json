We investigated whether a parental cancer diagnosis is associated with a higher-than-expected risk of injury among children by using a Swedish nationwide register-based cohort study. Compared to children without parental cancer, children with parental cancer had a higher rate of hospital contact for injury during the first year after parental cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-1.33), especially when the parent had a comorbid psychiatric disorder after cancer diagnosis (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.08-1.85). The rate increment declined during the second and third year after parental cancer diagnosis (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.07-1.14) and became null afterwards (HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.99-1.03). Children with parental cancer also had a higher rate of repeated injuries than the other children (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.12-1.15). Given the high rate of injury among children in the general population, our findings may have important public health implications."

We investigated whether a parental cancer diagnosis is associated with a higher-than-expected risk of injury among children by using a Swedish nationwide register-based cohort study. Compared to children without parental cancer, children with parental cancer had a higher rate of hospital contact for injury during the first year after parental cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-1.33), especially when the parent had a comorbid psychiatric disorder after cancer diagnosis (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.08-1.85). The rate increment declined during the second and third year after parental cancer diagnosis (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.07-1.14) and became null afterwards (HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.99-1.03). Children with parental cancer also had a higher rate of repeated injuries than the other children (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.12-1.15). Given the high rate of injury among children in the general population, our findings may have important public health implications."

Over the past 40 years, the number of individuals in Sweden diagnosed with cancer has more than doubled leaving growing numbers of families coping with the aftermath.

In fact, previous research has shown children with a parent who has cancer have a greater risk of behavioral problems or distress than children with two healthy parents."

One concern in particular is whether these children may be at increased risk of injury. Injuries are the most common reason for a child to visit a hospital and in some cases lead to deaths. Children who are not well supervised or whose parents have poor mental health are at increased risk of injury. Coping with cancer and the mental anguish it causes may distract parents and possibly place their children at increased risk of injury."

The analysis also revealed that the risk is particularly great if the parent with cancer also develops mental illness after the cancer diagnosis. The risk of injury is greatest in the first year after the parent\u2019s diagnosis. Fortunately, the elevated risk of injury decreases overtime and is almost non-existing after the third year. The analyses suggest that providing extra support for parents with cancer might help to reduce the risk of injury in their children."

In Sweden, the number of newly diagnosed cancer patients has more than doubled during the last forty years and a considerable proportion of these patients are parenting minor children (<a href=\"#bib38\">National Board of Health and Welfare, 2014</a>). A diagnosis of cancer in parents has repeatedly been shown to exert psychological and social stress in their children (<a href=\"#bib52\">Visser et al., 2004</a>). Coping with cancer may affect the parenting of both the ill and well parents, further impacting the behavioral and social adaptability of the children (<a href=\"#bib16\">Faulkner and Davey, 2002</a>). In contrast to the relatively rich literature on behavioral and mental well-being of children living with a parent with cancer, few studies have so far addressed somatic health outcomes among these children. In a recent study, we reported that children of parents with cancer had a higher risk of death, both due to cancer and other causes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2015</a>)."

For example, childhood injury has been associated with male sex, risk-taking behavior, lack of parental supervision as well as poor mental health of the parents (<a href=\"#bib30\">Matheny, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schwebel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Morrongiello et al., 2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Peden et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">McKinlay et al., 2010</a>). To our knowledge, no study has however specifically addressed the impact of parental cancer diagnosis on the risk of child injury. To this end, we leveraged the nationwide population and health registers in Sweden to explore the association between parental cancer diagnosis and the risk of hospital contact for injury among children."

The positive association between parental cancer and hospital contact for injury among children at all ages in the present study may therefore be jointly attributable to both the psychological distress among the children and the potential lack of parental supervision needed for injury prevention (<a href=\"#bib33\">Morrongiello et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Davis Kirsch et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Faulkner and Davey, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Asbridge et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bylund Grenklo et al., 2013</a>).

Although a positive association was mainly noted for unintentional injuries, the lack of statistical significance for intentional injuries might be due to the relatively small number of intentional injuries observed. Interestingly and reassuringly, we found no increased rate of assault-related injuries after parental cancer. The fact that the higher rate of injury was noted not only at home, but also in transportation areas, in sports areas, etc., suggests that efforts in preventing injuries in children living with a parent with cancer should include a larger circle of support."

Our results showed clearly that children had the highest injury rate increase during the first year after the parent\u2019s cancer diagnosis. This finding corroborates earlier findings in indicating that a cancer diagnosis poses severe psychological distress immediately after the diagnosis, both among the cancer patients and among their children (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fall et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huizinga et al., 2010</a>). Previous studies have demonstrated that the well-being of children living with a parent with cancer is largely dependent on the adjustment status of their parents to the cancer (<a href=\"#bib24\">Krattenmacher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nelson and While, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Thastum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Huizinga et al., 2011</a>). This was supported in our findings that children whose parent was also diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder after cancer diagnosis, appeared to have more pronounced rate increase of injury. Furthermore, among children with higher baseline risk of injury (i.e., children with previous hospital contact for injury), parental cancer was associated with an even more elevated risk for future injuries. These results highlight both a high-risk time window and high-risk groups for potential future interventions. Although the number of children living with a parent of cancer will undoubtedly increase due to the increasing cancer incidence and improving cancer survival, the postponement of childbearing, etc., the proportion of such children is however still small, making dedicated intervention both feasible and viable."

In line with our previous finding on child mortality after parental cancer, the present study indicated no difference between maternal and paternal cancer in relation to the consequent risk of childhood injury (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). In contrast to previous findings, we found no difference in child injury risk by the severity of parental cancer (<a href=\"#bib24\">Krattenmacher et al., 2012</a>). One potential explanation may be the fact that the severity of cancer does not always positively correlate with the adjustment status of the cancer patients. For example, in a recent large-scale study, it was reported that patients of cancers of relatively better survival (e.g., breast cancer) had the highest prevalence of mental disorders, whereas patients of cancers with much severe prognosis (e.g., pancreatic cancer) had the lowest prevalence (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mehnert et al., 2014</a>)."

The major strengths of our study include the nationwide cohort design, using the effective record linkage across the high quality Swedish population and health registers and the prospectively and independently collected information on exposure and outcome. These strengths enhance clearly the validity and generalizability of our findings. Some limitations of our study also deserve consideration. For instance, we had no information on the cohabitation or employment status of the parents. A cancer diagnosis may have considerable impact on the marital relationship and the family's economic status (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wozniak and Izycki, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">de Boer et al., 2009</a>) which may in turn trigger additional psychological distress of the parents, leading to suboptimal parenting (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tein et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sallinen et al., 2004</a>). Divorce or separation may further contribute to child injuries due to the departure of one parent from the household or simply a joint custody of the child between the parents. Therefore potential modifying effect of residence status within the family, as well as the cohabitation and employment status of the parents on the studied association deserves further investigation. Residual confounding due to unmeasured or unknown confounders is possible, however, with presumably small impact. In the multivariable models, only adjustment for the age of the child and the parental ages at child\u2019s birth had noticeable impact on the increase in injury risk, whereas adjustment for other covariates including birth characteristics of the child and educational level of the parents, which have previously been suggested to be associated with both injury risk among the children and cancer risk among the parents, had rather negligible impact (data not shown) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Innes and Byers, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sun et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Davey Smith et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beiki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hemminki and Li, 2003</a>). The facts that the rate increment was mainly noted during the first three years after parental cancer diagnosis but not thereafter, and that the rate increment was independent of number of siblings or whether the cancer is smoking/alcohol-related or not, further alleviated concerns about residual confounding. Misclassification of injuries remains possible as only above 80% of outpatient visits were included in the Patient Register currently (<a href=\"#bib36\">National Board of Health and Welfare, 2009</a>). However, such misclassification is largely administrative and arguably non-differential. Cancer parents with established contact with health care may be more likely to seek medical care for their children\u2019s injury. Yet, the opposite can also be postulated that while coping with this major illness, parents are less likely to seek medical care for minor hassles of their children. Such misclassification, if it exists, should have little impact on inpatient care for injury \u2013 a proxy of more severe injury event \u2013 and could not explain the largely increased injury rate during the first three years after parental cancer diagnosis whereas not thereafter."

Children with a parental cancer diagnosed before start of follow-up might not contribute to all three categories, depending on when the parental cancer was diagnosed and when follow-up was censored. Since we used time since birth as the underlying time scale, different HRs observed from these analyses did not conflict with the proportional hazards assumption tested. We sub-grouped parental cancer to explore whether maternal and paternal cancer had a different impact on child injury. To assess the impact of lifestyle factors as potential confounders for the studied association, we sub-grouped parental cancer as tobacco-related and other cancers, or alcohol-related and other cancers (<a href=\"#bib37\">National Board of Health and Welfare, 2013</a>; World Health Organization). To explore the potential modifying effect of cancer severity, we further categorized parental cancer as cancer with high, medium or low expected 5-year survival. The expected 5-year survival was indexed as the predicted 5-year relative survival rates of different cancer types based on the entire Cancer Register (<a href=\"#bib48\">Talback et al., 2004</a>). We further ascertained from the Patient Register hospital contacts for selected psychiatric comorbidity that were newly diagnosed after the cancer diagnosis among the parents. The psychiatric diagnoses considered were depression, anxiety disorders, stress reaction and adjustment disorder (detailed diagnoses and corresponding ICD codes are listed in the <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). We performed Wald tests to compare the HRs for different subgroups."

It is conceivable that there were more divorces around the time of cancer diagnosis. Cancer is devastating to a couple's wellbeing and may lead to a situation that triggers a separation, which in turn may lead to neglect by the caregiving parent in exerting proper surveillance to the child. It is also possible that the divorce will have been the triggering stressful event preceding a cancer diagnosis (a typical anecdote that oncologists like to recall). Either way, the ensuing separation may further contribute to injuries due to the departure of one of the parents from the household. Another scenario favoring injuries is also consistent with the above conditions. Separated or divorced parents may have joint custody of the child, which entails travel between two households and exposure to unfamiliar environments for the child, which in turn could lead to injuries. You should consider the extent of these possible conditions with respect to the social and behavioral mechanisms behind their findings. Please expand the Discussion to elaborate on these possible mechanisms."

It is conceivable that there were more divorces around the time of cancer diagnosis. Cancer is devastating to a couple's wellbeing and may lead to a situation that triggers a separation, which in turn may lead to neglect by the caregiving parent in exerting proper surveillance to the child. It is also possible that the divorce will have been the triggering stressful event preceding a cancer diagnosis (a typical anecdote that oncologists like to recall). Either way, the ensuing separation may further contribute to injuries due to the departure of one of the parents from the household. Another scenario favoring injuries is also consistent with the above conditions. Separated or divorced parents may have joint custody of the child, which entails travel between two households and exposure to unfamiliar environments for the child, which in turn could lead to injuries. You should consider the extent of these possible conditions with respect to the social and behavioral mechanisms behind their findings. Please expand the Discussion to elaborate on these possible mechanisms.</i> "

For example, if the parent had a cancer diagnosis on January 1, 1999 and the child was followed from January 1, 2001 until December 31, 2010, this child would contribute 1 person-year (January 1, 2001\u2013December 31, 2001) to the \u201c&gt;1 and \u22643 years\u201d category and 9 person-years (January 1, 2002 \u2013 December 31, 2010) to the \u201cmore than 3 years\u201d category in the analyses.

To compare the HRs of hospitalization and outpatient visit for injury, no direct method was available to our best knowledge. We therefore used a general method for comparing two HRs, exp(\u03b2<sub>1</sub>) and exp(\u03b2<sub>2</sub>), as previously reported (Altman and Bland, 2003). In brief, we first calculated <i>z score</i>= (\u03b2<sub>1</sub>\u2013 \u03b2<sub>2</sub>) / [SE(\u03b2<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> +SE(\u03b2<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>], then the calculated <i>z</i> score was compared to the standard normal distribution, leading to a <i>P</i> value. If <i>P</i>&lt;0.05, we report that the compared two HRs are statistically significantly different. In the present study, the HR of hospitalization for injury during the entire follow-up was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.99-1.08) and the HR of outpatient visit for injury was 1.08 (95% CI: 1.06-1.10) (section \"Results\"), leading to a <i>P</i> value of 0.10. The HR of hospitalization for injury during the first year after parental cancer diagnosis was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.07-1.31) and the HR of outpatient visit for injury during the first year was 1.29 (95% CI: 1.24-1.35) (section \"Results\"), leading to a <i>P</i> value of 0.20. Although the overall association tended to be stronger for outpatient visit for injury which would support the impact of parent\u2019s healthcare-seeking propensity, the difference was not statistically significant for either any time or the first year after cancer diagnosis. We therefore concluded that we could not draw a conclusion regarding whether or not the HRs for hospitalization and outpatient visit for injury were statistically significantly different from each other. A presumption of this method is that the two compared HRs are estimated from different (independent) samples. In the case of overlapping samples, as in the present study, this formula should be modified by adding a covariance term for \u03b2<sub>1</sub> and \u03b2<sub>2</sub> in the denominator. Although we generally presume that the covariance term is relatively small and has little influence on the estimated <i>P</i> values, it is unfortunately rather hard to precisely estimate this covariance term according to our knowledge."
