We discovered that key mutations in the <i>gltA</i> gene, which encodes citrate synthase (CS), occurred both before and after <i>Escherichia coli</i> gained the ability to grow aerobically on citrate (Cit<sup>+</sup> phenotype) during the Lenski long-term evolution experiment. The first <i>gltA</i> mutation, which increases CS activity by disrupting NADH-inhibition of this enzyme, is beneficial for growth on the acetate and contributed to preserving the rudimentary Cit<sup>+</sup> trait from extinction when it first evolved. However, after Cit<sup>+</sup> was refined by further mutations, this potentiating <i>gltA</i> mutation became deleterious to fitness. A second wave of beneficial <i>gltA</i> mutations then evolved that reduced CS activity to below the ancestral level. Thus, dynamic reorganization of central metabolism made colonizing this new nutrient niche contingent on both co-opting and overcoming a history of prior adaptation."

We discovered that key mutations in the <i>gltA</i> gene, which encodes citrate synthase (CS), occurred both before and after <i>Escherichia coli</i> gained the ability to grow aerobically on citrate (Cit<sup>+</sup> phenotype) during the Lenski long-term evolution experiment. The first <i>gltA</i> mutation, which increases CS activity by disrupting NADH-inhibition of this enzyme, is beneficial for growth on the acetate and contributed to preserving the rudimentary Cit<sup>+</sup> trait from extinction when it first evolved. However, after Cit<sup>+</sup> was refined by further mutations, this potentiating <i>gltA</i> mutation became deleterious to fitness. A second wave of beneficial <i>gltA</i> mutations then evolved that reduced CS activity to below the ancestral level. Thus, dynamic reorganization of central metabolism made colonizing this new nutrient niche contingent on both co-opting and overcoming a history of prior adaptation."

While there are many degrees of freedom that evolution can potentially access in altering cellular networks, only those mutational pathways that do not include deleterious intermediate steps are likely to be realized in most populations (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bridgham et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Weinreich et al., 2006</a>).

Subsequently, this rudimentary Cit<sup>+</sup> trait was refined to a stronger phenotype, Cit<sup>++</sup> , when cells that were capable of fully exploiting citrate during each 24\u2009hr growth cycle evolved, coincident with a large increase in cell density in this LTEE population (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blount et al., 2008</a>).

CS catalyzes the first irreversible step in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle: the aldol condensation of oxaloacetate (OAA) and acetyl-CoA to form citrate. Multiple mutations in one gene are rare in LTEE lineages that have retained the low ancestral mutation rate (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barrick et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wielgoss et al., 2011</a>), yet the <i>gltA</i> gene was mutated twice in most Cit<sup>++</sup> isolates, once before and once after Cit<sup>+</sup> evolved.

We conclude that mutations affecting CS activity, and more broadly flux through the TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt, were instrumental for potentiating the evolution of Cit<sup>+</sup> , and then for refining the Cit<sup>++</sup> phenotype. Our results underscore two principles of the evolution of complex systems that operate on long timescales. First, certain mutational paths that are immediately adaptive because they improve fitness in the current niche may be fortuitously co-opted to make future innovative leaps to new traits possible. Second, evolutionary innovations will often have disruptive effects on cellular networks, inverting epistatic relationships and prompting new waves of adaptation that may even reverse the effects of mutations that were necessary for accessing an innovation in the first place."

See <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a> for the DNA and protein sequence changes caused by each <i>gltA</i> mutation. (<b>B</b>) Muller plot of evolved allele frequencies over time constructed by using metagenomic DNA sequencing to profile archived samples of the LTEE population. Shaded regions correspond to the frequencies of genetically diverged subpopulations distinguished by different evolved alleles. When a colored sector arises within another region, it is a descendant of that genotype with at least this one new mutation and all of the mutations present in the earlier genotype because these populations are strictly asexual. Clades 1\u20133 correspond to a phylogenetic tree previously constructed by sequencing the genomes of clonal isolates (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blount et al., 2012</a>), which also constrains the order of certain mutations (e.g., <i>gltA1</i> &lt; <i>citT</i> &lt; <i>dctA</i>* &lt; any <i>gltA2</i>). Each of the <i>gltA2</i> alleles (shaded as in panel A) evolved independently and defines a separate evolved genotype and all of its descendants. Sequencing was performed on population samples from the times indicated with tick marks, and allele dynamics are shown as linearly interpolated between these points. The cell density of the entire LTEE population increased just prior to the dashed line at 33,500 generations (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blount et al., 2008</a>) when refined Clade 3 Cit<sup>++</sup> genotypes containing the <i>citT</i> and <i>dctA</i>* mutations evolved (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blount et al., 2012</a>). <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a> shows the mutations used to track the different clades."

The <i>gltA1</i> allele emerged again at 33,000 generations and reached nearly 100% frequency in the population by 33,500 generations.

We identified mutations causing amino acid substitutions in IclR (L201R) and ArcB (Q79L). IclR is a negative regulator of the <i>aceBAK</i> operon (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cortay et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Maloy and Nunn, 1982</a>), which encodes enzymes for the bypass segment of the glyoxylate pathway (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kornberg, 1966</a>). Derepression of this operon has been shown to increase acetate utilization (<a href=\"#bib31\">Maloy and Nunn, 1981</a>), reduce acetate excretion (<a href=\"#bib14\">Farmer and Liao, 1997</a>), and decrease lag time when switching from glucose to acetate in mixed media (<a href=\"#bib44\">Spencer et al., 2007</a>). ArcB is the sensor kinase of the ArcAB two-component system, which negatively regulates the expression of genes encoding enzymes in the TCA and glyoxylate cycles, including <i>gltA</i> and the <i>aceBAK</i> operon (<a href=\"#bib22\">Iuchi and Lin, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Waegeman et al., 2011</a>). Introduction of these mutations into the LTEE ancestor strain REL607 greatly increased its proficiency for acetate assimilation, as judged by growth curves (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Therefore, it seems likely that both the evolved <i>iclR</i> and <i>arcB</i> alleles are loss-of-function mutations that derepress expression of enzymes needed for acetate assimilation."

After energy minimization, we observed subtle differences in the predicted conformation of each enzyme variant, most notably around the NADH binding site. The most pronounced changes were in the orientation of histidine-110 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), even though this amino acid is distant from every <i>gltA</i> mutation. In the wild-type GltA structure, histidine-110 adopts an upward conformation that allows for accommodation of NADH in the binding pocket. The A258T <i>gltA1</i> mutation is predicted to reorient the histidine-110 side chain toward the binding pocket, presumably creating an unfavorable steric barrier to NADH binding. Addition of secondary <i>gltA2</i> mutations (A162V or A124T) resulted in simulated structures with histidine-110\u00a0oriented between these two extremes. Computational docking of NADH to these mutant CS structures predicted relative binding energies that were correlated with the experimentally determined NADH binding affinities (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

Genes whose expression is controlled by IclR and ArcAB are marked with symbols indicating the direction of transcriptional regulation, and the key citrate synthase (CS) reaction catalyzed by GltA is boxed in green. The results of the FBA modeling agree with our experimental observations that the combined effects of derepressing the IclR and ArcAB regulons via the <i>iclR</i> and <i>arcB</i> mutations and alleviating NADH-mediated allosteric inhibition of CS via the <i>gltA1</i> mutation are beneficial for growth on acetate because they increase flux values for these reactions toward levels that are optimal for this substrate. This metabolic program is thought to potentiate the evolution of Cit<sup>+</sup> by increasing the production of C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylates (succinate, fumarate, and malate) which can be exported in exchange for citrate uptake by the CitT antiporter.

However, when citrate is the sole carbon source, FBA predicts optimal growth when there is no flux through CS (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In fact, any CS activity is detrimental because sufficient flux to synthesize glutamate (and other compounds) from TCA cycle intermediates is already available. Under these conditions, oxaloacetate (OAA) is diverted into gluconeogenesis for the production of essential glycolytic intermediates and sugars (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sauer and Eikmanns, 2005</a>). This shift in metabolism leads to FBA predicting an increase in flux through the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase (<i>pck</i>) and malic enzyme (<i>maeA/maeB</i>) reactions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Eliminating CS flux also preserves its other CS substrate, acetyl-CoA, so that it can be used for other biosynthetic processes, rather than to produce unneeded TCA intermediates.

Initially only glucose and acetate, a byproduct of glucose metabolism, are accessible to Cit<sup>\u2013</sup> cells. The rudimentary Cit<sup>+</sup> trait enabled very limited utilization of some of the abundant citrate present in the growth medium. Once this ability was refined to the Cit<sup>++</sup> phenotype by further mutations, all of the citrate present was fully exploited. The areas of each box roughly reflect the relative amounts of each of the three carbon sources. (<b>B</b>) The initial <i>gltA1</i> mutation potentiated the evolution of Cit<sup>+</sup>. This mutation and additional mutations in <i>iclR</i> and <i>arcB</i> all improve acetate utilization in Cit<sup>\u2013</sup> cells by increasing flux through the TCA and glyxolyate cycles. The order of accumulation of these mutations, interspersed with many other mutations during the LTEE, is represented by arrows on the left side of the figure. These mutations may potentiate the evolution of the weak Cit<sup>+</sup> phenotype because they create a potentiated version of central metabolism that is capable of replenishing succinate and/or other C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylates that must be exported in exchange for citrate import by the CitT antiporter. In accordance with this model, the addition of the CitT-activating mutation (<i>citT</i>) to an evolved genetic background that crucially contains the <i>gltA1</i> mutation results in a rudimentary Cit<sup>+</sup> phenotype that is neutral or slightly beneficial to fitness and thus represents a path accessible to evolution, denoted by an arrow to mark the transition as shown in left bar graph. In contrast, adding the <i>citT</i> mutation to the same genetic background but without the <i>gltA1</i> mutation is highly deleterious to fitness, rendering this path inaccessible to evolution within the LTEE population, as shown in right bar graph. (<b>C</b>) Fitness effects of <i>gltA</i> alleles show sign epistasis with nutrient utilization niche. The <i>gltA1</i> mutation that increased citrate synthase activity was beneficial to fitness when it evolved prior to the Cit<sup>+</sup> innovation when only glucose and acetate could be utilized, as shown in the bar graph on the left. While necessary for the evolution of the rudimentary Cit<sup>+</sup> phenotype by <i>citT</i> activation, the effect of <i>gltA1</i> mutation is suboptimal for fitness once the <i>dctA</i>* mutation evolves and the citrate utilization niche can be fully exploited. Under this condition, the <i>gltA1</i> mutation was deleterious to fitness and <i>gltA2</i> mutations evolved that reversed the effect of the <i>gltA1</i> mutation and even further reduced citrate synthase activity below the ancestral level to improve fitness in this niche, as shown in bar graph on the right. Note that relative fitness is on a different scale in each of the fitness diagrams, as all Cit<sup>++</sup> strains are considerably more fit than any Cit<sup>\u2013</sup> strain due to the abundant citrate in the growth medium."

An allosterically deregulated citrate synthase enzyme, which continuously inputs increased carbon flux into the TCA cycle during growth on glucose/acetate, coupled with overall transcriptional derepression of the TCA and glyoxylate cycles, could replenish the intracellular supply of succinate and/or other C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylates that are excreted in exchange for citrate by the CitT antiporter. The unbalanced loss of these important biosynthetic precursors might explain the detrimental fitness effect of becoming Cit<sup>+</sup> via the <i>citT</i> mutation in cells lacking <i>gltA1</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Thus, the <i>gltA1</i> mutation was necessary for potentiating the evolution of Cit<sup>+</sup> because it converted the <i>citT</i> duplication from a prohibitive step downward into a valley in the fitness landscape into a step in an upward mutational route."

These <i>gltA2</i> mutations were beneficial for growth on citrate as the primary carbon source (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), and they share a common overall effect: all are expected to decrease citrate synthase activity. When growing on citrate as a carbon source, the CS reaction is expected to be detrimental in that it consumes acetyl-CoA and diverts OAA that is needed for gluconeogenesis back into the TCA cycle, a futile-cycle under these conditions. While allosteric regulation of wild-type CS may have been able to adjust flux through this reaction to the very low levels that are optimal under these conditions, this was apparently not possible with the <i>gltA1</i> mutation already present. Therefore, <i>gltA2</i> mutations emerged that reverse the change in enzyme activity caused by <i>gltA1</i>, either by decreasing mRNA expression levels, by reducing the catalytic proficiency of this enzyme, and/or by restoring allosteric inhibition by NADH (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

As a whole, the LTEE populations have explored numerous variations on the complex metabolic and regulatory networks of <i>E. coli</i> as they have adapted. This diversity has allowed some lineages of cells to explore new nutrient niches, in particular citrate utilization. While rudimentary citrate utilization via activation of the <i>citT</i> gene could presumably have arisen at any time and in any of the LTEE populations, we have shown that it would have been at a selective disadvantage if it appeared in a non-potentiated genetic background. Moreover, if the structure of the metabolic and regulatory networks and their component genes yielded relatively few genetic pathways with which to improve growth on glucose, it is unlikely that the multi-step mutational pathway to Cit<sup>+</sup> that first required mutations that improve acetate utilization would ever have been realized. Therefore, complexity in both the resource environment and in the genetic architecture of the cell conspired to make this metabolic innovation possible."

The components of an organism's metabolic, regulatory, and developmental networks have evolved to interact in complex ways that are attuned to its current niche. Yet, these networks are also poised such that they can be dynamically reorganized toward new purposes by only a few mutations in key enzymes and regulatory proteins. As we observed for changes in citrate synthase activity at different stages in the emergence of citrate utilization during the Lenski LTEE, it may often be case that evolution must fine-tune essential links in these networks as it traverses epistatic turns and switchbacks on the tenuous mutational paths that lead to the successful colonization of new niches."

Lastly, amino acid substitutions in a given GltA variant were added sequentially with energy minimization to an RMS gradient of 10<sup>-3</sup> kcal/mol/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> using the Amber12 force field with Extended H\u00fcckel Theory and R-field solvation electrostatics after each mutation.

The genome-scale model of <i>E.\u00a0coli</i> strain REL606 metabolism, iECB_1328 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Monk et al., 2013</a>), was used for this analysis. The model incorporates 2,750 reactions and 1954 metabolites. Default media conditions and reaction bounds were used. Carbon source uptake fluxes were set at 10 mmol per gram dry cell weight per hour unless otherwise stated. To simulate combined utilization of citrate and glucose, the uptake fluxes for each carbon source were adjusted to match the molar ratio at which they are present in DM25 (10:1). We used flux variability analysis to predict the full ranges of flux values for reactions in central metabolism that exist within the set of optimal global solutions. There was no variability in the optimal flux predicted for the citrate synthase reaction under any of the conditions we tested."

It was known that a mutation involving <i>citT</i> was important for initial citrate uptake and a second mutation in <i>dctA</i> was essential for full utilization of the resource. However, the rarity of the adaptation (occurring in only 1 of 12 populations) suggested that other potentiating mutations were involved. The authors argue that a mutation in citrate synthase (<i>gltA</i>) was a critical for enabling citrate consumption to evolve. They show that the <i>gltA1</i> mutation arose before the <i>E. coli</i> evolved citrate import, and that the initial <i>citT</i> mutation is deleterious in the absence of <i>gltA1</i>. The authors demonstrate that <i>gltA1</i> can increase fitness on acetate, but that the mutation becomes deleterious once cells have acquired the ability to utilize citrate. A second set of mutations (termed <i>gltA2</i>) is able to compensate for the cost of <i>gltA1</i>. The authors show that <i>gltA1</i> increases activity of citrate synthase by removing allosteric inhibition by NADH, while subsequent mutations in the gene reduce activity of the protein through a variety of methods. Finally Quandt et al. use metabolic modeling to show that optimal growth on acetate involves increased flux through citrate synthase relative to glucose, and that optimal growth on citrate requires no flux through this pathway. Combining these bits of evidence the authors suggest that utilization of citrate involved a mutation in <i>gltA</i> that improved growth on acetate and potentiated the <i>citT</i> mutation, by increasing flux through TCA. Once cells became strong citrate utilizers, the initial <i>gltA</i> mutation became deleterious driving the evolution of a diversity of secondary mutations to compensate for its cost. This manuscript represents an extensive amount of work, and I think it will be of great interest to many in the experimental evolution community."

For the most part I found it a pleasure to read and digest. The authors could do far better with their presentation of data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. To me, as someone who knows the TCA cycle and even cares about it, I struggled to make sense of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> similar left me confused. I appreciate the attempt to present the full picture \u2013 and this absolutely must be retained \u2013 but the reader has to be taken through the data. At the present time there is simply too much information. This frustrates me because I want to understand the full weight of the data. After pouring over <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, the caption and the text, I began to wonder whether I had fully understood what had come before.</i>"
