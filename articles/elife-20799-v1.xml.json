Here, we discovered that, in the developing neuron from rat, Akt signaling regulates axon growth and growth cone formation through phosphorylation of serine 14 (S14) on Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2). This enhances Id2 protein stability by means of escape from proteasomal degradation, and steers its localization to the growth cone, where Id2 interacts with radixin that is critical for growth cone formation. Knockdown of <i>Id2,</i> or abrogation of Id2 phosphorylation at S14, greatly impairs axon growth and the architecture of growth cone. Intriguingly, reinstatement of Akt/Id2 signaling after injury in mouse hippocampal slices redeemed growth promoting ability, leading to obvious axon regeneration. Our results suggest that Akt/Id2 signaling is a key module for growth cone formation and axon growth, and its augmentation plays a potential role in CNS axonal regeneration."

Here, we discovered that, in the developing neuron from rat, Akt signaling regulates axon growth and growth cone formation through phosphorylation of serine 14 (S14) on Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2). This enhances Id2 protein stability by means of escape from proteasomal degradation, and steers its localization to the growth cone, where Id2 interacts with radixin that is critical for growth cone formation. Knockdown of <i>Id2,</i> or abrogation of Id2 phosphorylation at S14, greatly impairs axon growth and the architecture of growth cone. Intriguingly, reinstatement of Akt/Id2 signaling after injury in mouse hippocampal slices redeemed growth promoting ability, leading to obvious axon regeneration. Our results suggest that Akt/Id2 signaling is a key module for growth cone formation and axon growth, and its augmentation plays a potential role in CNS axonal regeneration."

Injured axons of the adult central nervous system (CNS) do not regenerate, because the ability to activate growth genes and growth cone substantially declines as neurons mature (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fawcett, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fernandes and Tetzlaff, 2001</a>), and the CNS environment is hostile to those processes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Filbin, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Goldberg et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Silver and Miller, 2004</a>). Neutralization of environmental inhibition is not sufficient for axon regeneration; therefore, elucidating intrinsic growth capacity and regulation of the neuron after injury is of critical importance (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yiu and He, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fawcett et al., 1992</a>). Indeed, recent studies have proposed that reactivation of the intrinsic growth ability promotes CNS axon regeneration (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rossi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Teng and Tang, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bouquet and Nothias, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Smith et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Leibinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Watkins et al., 2013</a>). It has been proposed that the mechanisms involved in axonal regeneration of the mature CNS have many features in common with those important in CNS development (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cui, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Harel and Strittmatter, 2006</a>)."

It regulates both axon establishment and elongation both during development and in the regeneration of mature neurons through glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). However, the mechanism of GSK3 control of peripheral axon regeneration is controversial and its function in CNS axon regeneration remains unknown (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yoshimura et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Saijilafu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gobrecht et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, Akt links a host of signaling molecules through activation of mTORC1, which regulates cap-dependent protein translation by inhibiting TSC1/2 to allow axon development, growth, and regeneration in CNS (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Morita and Sobue, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Park et al., 2008</a>). However, some evidence suggested an mTORC1 independent pathway that regulates axon regrowth in phosphatase and tensin homolog (<i>Pten</i>) deficient neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Park et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yang et al., 2014</a>), which causes aberrant activation of Akt signaling. Thus, although Akt signaling encompasses developmental regulation of the intrinsic neuronal growth and axon regeneration after injury, the roles and molecular mechanism of Akt signaling in the growth of CNS axons remain to be determined."

During development, Id2 binds to bHLH transcription factors and hampers their ability to activate transcription of several growth inhibitory molecules and receptors, thus promoting axon growth (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jackson, 2006</a>). Id2 degradation by a complex of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its activator Cdh1 (APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>) reduces axonal growth in the adult (<a href=\"#bib56\">Stegm\u00fcller and Bonni, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lasorella et al., 2006</a>). Conversely, protection from Id2 degradation results in erratic growth and an abnormal distribution of parallel fibers in the cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Konishi et al., 2004</a>), while enhanced Id2 expression in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) promotes axonal growth after spinal cord injury (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yu et al., 2011</a>). Thus, Id2 contributes to axonal growth during development and may also be involved in the intrinsic inability of the injured axons to regenerate in the adult (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lasorella et al., 2006</a>). However, to our knowledge the specific temporal and spatial signals that may regulate the molecular changes induced by Id2 are not yet understood."

We identified Id2, as a new binding partner and novel kinase substrate of Akt. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of serine 14 (S14) on Id2 augmented its protein stability through disruption of the association of Id2 and E3 ligase Cdh1. During neuronal differentiation, S14- phosphorylated Id2 is predominantly enriched in the growth cones at the axonal tips where it facilitates axonal growth. This contributed to the maintenance of the growth cone via interaction with radixin, one of the ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) family of proteins, which links F-actin to the plasma membrane. Moreover, in organotypic hippocampal slice culture, reactivation of Akt/Id2 signaling by adeno-associated virus (AAV) two after injury, prominently increased regrowth of axons, whereas ablation of Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Id2 caused failure in axonal regeneration. Our study suggests the molecular basis of intrinsic growth regulation of Akt/Id2 signaling and delineates the potential role of Akt/Id2 in CNS axonal regeneration."

In an effort to identify downstream targets of the Akt signal that might be involved in the regulation of axon growth, we examined protein interaction profiles using proteomic analysis in PC12 cells stably transfected with a constitutively active (CA) form or a kinase-dead (KD) form of Akt. Interestingly, our proteomic analysis showed that Id2 is a potent binding partner of active Akt (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, we found endogenous interaction between Akt and Id2 in mouse brain lysates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>); the specific interaction was confirmed in mouse brain extract using purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Id2 protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Employing Flag-tagged Akt isoforms (Akt1-3), we verified that, among the three isoforms evaluated, Id2 interacts with Akt1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Our mapping analysis showed that the PH domain of Akt interacts with Id2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Reciprocal experiments with a series of purified GST-tagged Id2 fragments demonstrated that the helix domain of Id2 adjacent to the C-terminus bound to Akt (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

Based on our finding of a development-dependent decline in Akt/Id2 signaling, we wondered if Akt activation regulates Id2 stability by blocking its proteasomal degradation. Treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 protected against Id2 degradation, confirming that the reduction in Id2 level is facilitated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-dependent degradation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Overexpression of Cdh1 markedly reduced endogenous Id2 level; importantly, this effect was prevented by Akt expression in PC12 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In cortical neurons, Id2 protein level was proportionally increased with increased Akt level in the presence of Cdh1, indicating that Akt prevents Id2 degradation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Accordingly, polyubiquitination of Id2 was efficiently abrogated in the presence, but not in the absence of Akt (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), indicating that Akt regulates Id2 protein stability by preventing APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>-mediated degradation."

While Id2-WT and Id2-S14D rarely bound to Cdh1, the phospho-ablated mutant form of Id2 largely showed enhanced association with Cdh1, reflecting its instability and weak detection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Moreover, Id2-WT was found to be more stable in the presence of CA-Akt than in that of KD-Akt, while the Id2-S14A mutant was not stabilized by CA-Akt as it could not be phosphorylated. The protein level of phospho-mimetic Id2-S14D was highly stable regardless of whether CA-Akt or KD-Akt was expressed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Furthermore, using Akt inhibitor VIII, a chemical inhibitor of Akt signaling, we showed a reduction of Id2 protein levels as its phosphorylation is decreased upon inhibition of AKT phosphorylation, whereas in the presence of PD184352, a chemical inhibitor of MAPK signaling, Id2 stability or phosphorylation is not altered (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). These data suggest that Akt-dependent Id2 phosphorylation enhances resistance to Cdh1-mediated degradation of Id2, interrupting the interaction between Id2 and Cdh1."

Cultured hippocampal neurons at DIV three were immunolabeled with neuron specific class III beta tubulin (Tuj1) antibody to assess the extent of axon growth. Ectopic expression of Id2-WT led to considerably better axon growth and branching than that of control; S14D expressing neurons showed more abundant branching and extended length of axon than did the control or Id2-WT expressing neurons, revealing high expression at the tip of axon and branching. In contrast, the phospho-ablated mutant (S14A)-expressing neurons exhibited substantially shorter extent of axon growth and less branching in primary cultured hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Interestingly, we failed to detect GFP signal in the axonal tip of S14A expressing neurons despite no alteration of this signal in the soma, indicating lack of Id2 expression in the growth cone of the growing axon (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, third panel).

During the differentiation of hippocampal neurons, we found that prominent endogenous-Id2 expression occurred in the central domain of growth cone and partially colocalized with phalloidin-labeled F-actin, while S14-phospho-Id2 was localized on punctate structures all-around of the growth cone area and filopodia. S14-phospho-Id2 stained strongly in the growth cone leading edge and the peripheral domain, revealing notable co-distribution with phalloidin-labeled F-actin in the growing axon (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>).\u00a0To more accurately determine the role of Akt/Id2 signaling in the growth cone, we monitored Id2 and S14-phospho-Id2 expression as neuronal development proceeded (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In the early stage (stage 1: DIV 1) both Id2 and S14-phospho-Id2 were observed in the filopodial and lamellipodial structure of the leading margin. However, as the axon developed (stage II~III: DIV 2 and 3), Id2 was predominantly detected in the central microtubule-containing zone, demonstrating complete co-localization with beta tubulin, while S14-phospho-Id2 displayed a more intense signal at the peripheral-domain of growth cone, where there was relatively less beta tubulin staining (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Stage determination was performed as previously described for hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dotti et al., 1988</a>). Moreover, quantitative analysis that determined the expression level of Id2 or S14-phospho-Id2 from soma to axonal tip, supported the notion that S14-phospho-Id2 is relatively enriched in the tip of the growth cone, with respect to that of Id2, as confirmed by fluorescence intensity analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>)."

ERM proteins link the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane and play prominent roles in growth cone morphology and motility (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mangeat et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dickson et al., 2002</a>). While ezrin and moesin expression is strongest in the central region of growth cone, radixin is highly stained in the peripheral region with phalloidin-label F-actin (<a href=\"#bib42\">Marsick et al., 2012</a>). When we used an anti-ERM antibody that recognizes an epitope common to all ERM family members, our immunoprecipitation assay mouse brain extract (E18) showed that endogenous Id2 interacts with the ERM proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Interestingly, compared to the binding affinity of Id2 to ERM, brain extracts immunoprecipitated with anti-S14-phospho-Id2 antibody showed a relatively strong interaction with the ERM proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), suggesting that S14-phospho-Id2 probably binds to radixin among the ERM proteins based on the peripheral distribution of S14-phospho-Id2 and radixin. Id2 was concentrated in the central region and in the base of some filopodia, while radixin expression was relatively abundant in the peripheral region (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Intriguingly, S14-phospho-Id2 was highly expressed in the peripheral filopodia, revealing co-distribution with radixin, as confirmed by fluorescence analysis (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

We infected the growing axon from hippocampal neuron (stage III) with either GFP-lentiviral control or GFP-lentiviral Id2-siRNA. Control GFP-expressing lentivirus-infected neurons showed normal growth cone architecture that was visualized with expression of radixin. However, knockdown of Id2 in the growing axon dramatically disrupted growth cone shape and cytoskeletal organization detected in neurons with reduced radixin levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Quantitative analysis of neuronal response involving alteration of the growth cone indicated noticeable reduction of growth cone size and shortening of axon length, implicating the importance of Id2 expression in the growth cone formation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Accordingly, restoring Id2 signaling in the absence of endogenous Id2 expressing WT or S14D-Id2 rescued the deregulated axon growth. Conversely, RFP-vector control or S14A-Id2 mutant expression failed to rescue the effect of Id2 in the growth cone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>)."

In the growth cone of the stage III neuron, radixin was evidently visualized in the filopodia of the growth cone and S14-phospho-Id2 was concentrated in axonal tip (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Upon treatment of the hippocampal neuron (stage III) with an Akt inhibitor, we found that the number of radixin expressing filopodia was greatly diminished in the axonal growth cone. We also observed that the intensity of radixin staining, as well as the intensity of S14-phospho-Id2 staining, as following the treatment, was remarkably lower than that of the control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). This indicates that S14 phosphorylation is critical for the proper function of radixin in the growth cone. In addition, knockdown of radixin in the growing neuron induced alteration in growth cone morphology and size and reduced the number of filopodia. This phenomenon parallels the alteration of endogenous S14-phospho-Id2 distribution as a reduction of growth cone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, ectopic expression of GFP-S14D-Id2 in neurons lacking radixin was not able to concretely maintain growth cone size and numbers of process (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), underscoring the functional relevance of the Akt-Id2-radixin pathway for growth cone formation."

Akt-mediated S14 phosphorylation did not alter the interaction between Id2 and E47 and both S14D and S14A mutants resulted in a repression of E47-activated luciferase activity similar to Id2-WT (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Moreover, employing Id2 constructs that cannot bind to E47 to antagonize transcriptional repression activity of Id2 showed that disruption of the HLH domain of Id1 by a substitution of proline to serine at position 74 or valine to proline at position 91 abolished its ability to inhibit E47 DNA binding (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pesce and Benezra, 1993</a>). By substituting proline with serine at position 51, or valine with proline at position 68 in the Id2 counterpart, (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>), we demonstrated that although Id2 mutants (S51P or V68P) barely repress E47 transcriptional activity while Id2 WT successfully represses E47-mediated transcription displaying relatively high luciferase activity and the mRNA expression of Nogo receptor, one of well-known downstream gene of E47 (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>), Akt-mediated phosphorylation mimetic mutation in either S51P (S14D/ S51P) or V68P (S14D/V68P) provoked axon growth and growth cone localization of these mutants (S14D/ S51P or S14D/V68P), and its effect resembled that of Id2 WT in the growth cone (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3E,F</a>), suggesting that Akt mediated S14 phosphorylation probably regulates Id2 apart from transcriptional repression regulation. Taken together, these data suggest that in addition to transcriptional repression of axonal inhibitory molecules in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib46\">Perk et al., 2005</a>), Id2 expression in the growing axonal growth cone is a decisive factor for normal growth cone formation and axon growth. These data also suggest that Akt may not simply regulates transcriptional repression of Id2, but also growth cone localization of Id2 that is crucial for its association with radixin in the growing axon, an association that contributes to growth cone function."

However, both the number and length of the regenerating axons that entered the hippocampus were greatly increased in the AAV2-Id2-WT-infected slices, whereas expression of the AAV2-Id2-S14A in the slices resulted in an approximate five-fold decrease in the number of regenerating axons growing into the denervated hippocampus from that of the Id2-WT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>).

Akt-mediated S14 phosphorylation of Id2 augments protein stability of Id2 through interruption of the interaction between Id2 and Cdh1, thereby reducing ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Id2. In the growing axon, Id2 is highly expressed at the branching point and axonal tip, leading to enhanced axon growth and branching through S14 phosphorylation. More importantly, Akt/Id2 signaling is essential for growth cone formation, interacting with radixin at the peripheral region of the growth cone. Giving hope for translating intrinsic axon growth regulators into treatment in CNS injury, introduction of AAV2-Id2 at the injured EH dramatically enhanced axon regrowth and infection with AAV2-Id2 with active Akt noticeably enhancing axon regrowth, whereas AAV2-Id2 with Akt inhibitor failed to promote axon regeneration. This would suggest that reintroduction of Akt/Id2 signaling in injured CNS neurons might be a useful therapeutic approach for promoting axon regeneration."

Notably, the expression of Akt and Id2 occurs not only in the soma, where Id2 probably prevents expression of E47-induced anti-axonal genes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Perk et al., 2005</a>), but also at the branching point and the tip of the growing axon, revealing accumulation of S14-phospho-Id2 at the peripheral region of the growth cone, including the actin-rich periphery and filopodia (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figures 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> ; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figures 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> ; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figures 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> ). However, the role and regulation of Id2 in the growth cone has not been elucidated. Here we showed that ectopic expression of S14D-Id2 greatly enhances axon growth and branching, whereas S14A impairs axon growth and branching, rarely detecting growing distal axon (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Moreover, knockdown of Id2 from developing neuron (stage III) that have distinguishable axons, elicited growth cone collapse and subsequent interruption of axon growth (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Furthermore, interference in Id2 phosphorylation by Akt inhibitor demolished axonal growth cone structure including filopodia (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Thus, these finding suggest that, in addition to its role as transcriptional repressor during development of the hippocampal neuron, Id2 acts as downstream mediator of Akt signaling, dictating its protein stability and positioning at the growth cone, and thereby contributing to the proper growth cone formation and axon growth. However, further investigation would be required to determine how S14 phosphorylation of Id2 by Akt steers Id2 localization to the growth cone, where Id2 interacts with radixin, which might be critical for normal growth cone architecture."

However, an Akt-independent function of GSK3\u03b2 in axon growth and polarization has also been suggested (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Diez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that other substrates of Akt may be implicated in axonal length regulation. On the other hand, mTORC1, another well-known downstream target of Akt, has been proposed to be another factor in axon formation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Park et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Morita and Sobue, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). However, a clear link between Akt mediated regulation of mTORC1 and axonal growth in the CNS neuron has not been directly established. In this study, we proposed Id2 as a novel downstream effector of Akt signaling in the developing CNS neuron. Akt confined S14-phospho-Id2 at the tip of the growing axon thereby allowing its interaction with radixin, which functions in growth cone morphology and motility. We further demonstrated that ablation of S14 phosphorylation of Id2 led to a failure to bind to radixin and altered growth cone morphology (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), suggesting that, during neuronal development, Akt/Id2 signaling contributes to maintenance of the normal structure and functional organization of the growth cone, conceivably interacting with radixin, as S14D-Id2 failed to rescue the altered growth cone in the absence of radixin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>).

We observed that phosphorylation by Akt, Id2 acts as an ERM binding protein, which bound F-actin and enriched the peripheral region of growth cone, while unphosphorylated Id2 predominantly localized in the central region of the growth cone where growing microtubule directed to actin network and, among Id family members (Id1-Id4), only Id2 possesses a SxIP motif-specific sequence to enable its interaction with end binding (EB) proteins and the most prominent microtubule (MT) plus end binding protein (+TIP), which promotes MT dynamicity and growth (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coles and Bradke, 2015</a>); thus, it is possible to conjecture that Id2 may act as +TIP thereby capable to crosslink the two filaments, actin and microtubule, during axon growth. Two independent studies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arroyo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Huttlin et al., 2015</a>), have speculated that both Akt1 and Id2 are interacting partners of cytoplasmic linker associated protein 2 (CLASP2), which is known to act +TIP (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beffert et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, in addition to radixin, Id2 also interacts with actin-associated enigma homolog (ENH) and is sequestered into the cytoplasm from nucleus during neural differentiation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lasorella and Iavarone, 2006</a>). Likewise, Id2 seems to be associated with both actin and microtubule filaments, and we also observed that Id2 forms a complex with EB1 and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (data not shown). We are currently planning experiments to determine whether Akt/Id2 signaling coordinates actin and microtubule dynamics in the growth cone."

                        "text": "Successful axon regeneration must be preceded by the successful formation of new growth cones. It has been reported that <i>Akt1</i> mRNA was markedly upregulated in injured neurons in adult rats, and that the phosphorylated Akt protein was dramatically increased after axotomy in adult motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib44\">Namikawa et al., 2000</a>). A recent study has shown that infection with an Id2-adenovirus prevented E47-mediated induction of the Nogo receptor, which is responsible for three myelin proteins (myelin-associated glycoprotein, Nogo-A, and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein) that account for most of the inhibitory activity of CNS myelin (<a href=\"#bib54\">Silver and Miller, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lasorella et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schwab and Bartholdi, 1996</a>). In other studies, blocking growth inhibitory molecules allowed for limited regeneration (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dimou et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fry et al., 2007</a>), suggesting the need for strategies that enhance the intrinsic growth potential of CNS neurons to achieve regeneration. Based on our finding that the development-dependent decline in Akt/Id2 signaling (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and the reintroduction of Akt/Id2 signaling or enhanced Id2 stability by Akt-mediated phosphorylation are critical for axon growth and for the formation of a new growth cone, we attempted to determine the intrinsic growth potential contributed by Akt/Id2 signaling, when the growth ability of CNS neurons has declined. Intriguingly, AAV2-Id2 infection after injury in EH obviously facilitates axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>) and AAV2-S14D-Id2 or AAV2-Id2 with active Akt robustly enhanced axon regrowth (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>), resulting in numerous axons entering the hippocampus after biocytin tracing. In contrast the functional blockade of Id2 by AAV2-phospho-ablated mutants, or treatment with Akt inhibitor in the presence of AAV2-Id2-WT, notably reduced axonal regeneration in the EH model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C,F,G</a>). Therefore, with the hope of translating intrinsic axon growth regulators into injured CNS, Akt/Id2 signaling could be a potent module to enhance the intrinsic growth potential in damaged CNS neurons"

First, the authors identify Id2 (Inhibitor of DNA-binding protein 2) as a binding partner of Akt through mass spec. They then show that phosphorylation of Id2 on Serine 14 affects its stability, with consequences for axonal outgrowth and branching in primary hippocampal neurons. Next, they argue that Id2 is present not only in the nucleus but also in the growth cone. Finally, the authors use an in vitro hippocampal slice preparation of axon regeneration to demonstrate that activation of Id2 and Akt/Id2 promotes axon regeneration."

The co-localization and interaction studies in this study are not sufficient to rule out the possibility that Akt simply regulates Id2 mediated transcription, regardless of where this phosphorylation event may occur.

In the developing nervous system, Id2 enhances cell proliferation and inhibits the activity of neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and E proteins such as E47 and E12. Id2 does not bind to DNA because of the lack of a DNA binding domain, but it preferentially binds to ubiquitously expressed bHLH transcription factor and E proteins, and sequesters them from tissue-specific transcription factors such as NeuroD in processes such as neurogenesis, in which these other factors must compete with Id2 to heterodimerize with E proteins. Activation of the bHLH transcription factor E47 induces expression of a group of genes, including Nogo receptor, Sema3F, and Notch1 (Perk et al., 2005; Lasorella et al., 2006; Wang and Baker, 2015), which potently inhibit axon growth."

                    "text": "First, we asked whether Akt simply regulates Id2-dependent transcription. To determine this, we examined whether Akt-mediated Id2 phosphorylation enhances the interaction between Id2 and E47, thereby upregulating the inhibition of E47-mediated transcription. We co-transfected GFP- Id2-WT, S14D, or S14A with HA-E47 into PC12 cells and performed immunoprecipitation analysis. Id2 phosphorylation did not alter the interaction between Id2 and E47, showing that all Id2 constructs, regardless of phosphorylation status, had similar interactions with E47 (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In addition, we performed luciferase reporter assays with 3 multimerized E-boxes driving the expression of luciferase (3xE-box-luc) (Jung et al., 2010). Co-transfection of PC12 cells (which express endogenous NeuroD) with 3xE-box-luc and E47 led to significantly higher luciferase activity than the background luciferase activity (3xE-box-luc alone) and, as expected, overexpression of GFP- Id2-WT notably reduced the luciferase activity. In accordance with the results of our binding analysis indicating that S14 phosphorylation of Id2 did not affect Id2 binding to E47, both S14D and S14A mutants also resulted in a repression of E47-activated luciferase activity, as similar to Id2-WT (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Taken together, our results suggest that Akt-mediated S14 phosphorylation of Id2 is probably not necessary for E47 binding since dimerization in the bHLH family has been reported to be mediated by the HLH domain (Voronova and Baltimore, 1990; Pesce and Benezra, 1993) while Akt-dependent phosphorylation occurs N-terminal S14 residue. Therefore, Akt may not simply regulate Id2-mediated transcriptional inhibition but more likely is important in regulating axon growth and growth cone formation in the axonal tip."

                    "text": "Second, instead of using Id2 constructs that lack DNA binding activity due to lack of DNA binding ability of Id2, we generated Id2 constructs that cannot bind to E47 to antagonize transcriptional repression activity of Id2. In accordance with a previous observation that showed disruption of the HLH domain of Id1 by a proline-to-serine substitution at position 74 or a valine-to-proline substitution at position 91 abolished its ability to inhibit E47 DNA binding (Pesce and Benezra, 1993), we generated proline-to-serine substitutions at position 51 or valine-to-proline substitutions at position 68 in Id2 counterparts (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Our binding assay showed that the interaction between E47 and P51S or V68P Id2 mutant was much weaker than that of Id2 WT (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Moreover, both P51S and V68P mutations in the HLH domain of Id2 severely impaired the inhibition of E47-mediated transcription by Id2, revealing higher luciferase activity levels with P51S or V68P expression than observed for Id2-WT (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Furthermore, co-transfection of Id2-WT with HA-E47 prevented the E47-mediated transcription of growth inhibitory molecules such as Nogo receptor, one of the best known inhibitors of axon growth (Schwab, 2004) whereas co-transfection of P51S or V68P Id2 mutant with E47 demonstrated relatively less inhibitory effect (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). To confirm the effect of Akt-mediated S14 phosphorylation on axon growth, we generated phosphor-mimetic P51S (S14D, P51S-Id2) or V68P Id2 (S14D, V68P-Id2) mutants and phosphor-ablated P51S (S14A, P51S-Id2) or V68P Id2 mutants (S14A, V68P-Id2), and determined axon growth and growth cone formation. Although both P51S and V68P Id2 mutant nominally repressed E47-mediated transcription, phosphor-mimetic mutation in P51S (S14D, P51S-Id2) or V68P Id2 (S14D, V68P-Id2) prominently promoted axon growth and led to growth cone localization of these mutant showing normal growth cone architecture resembling S14D-Id2 in the developing neuron (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3E, F</a>). These data suggest that Akt-mediated S14 phosphorylation probably regulates Id2 independently from transcriptional repression regulation contributing normal growth cone formation and axon growth."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, knockdown of Id2 disrupted growth cone architecture and was minimally detected in the growth cone while in the control, Id2 expression was prominent in the growth cone. Immunostaining against anti-S14-phospho antibody in the control SCR expressing neuron showed that the phosphor-S14 signal is co-localized with the Id2 signal in the growth cone, revealing an intense signal at the peripheral domain of the growth cone. However, we failed to detect any specific signal of anti-S14-phosphor antibody after knockdown of Id2 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). In other ways, upon Akt inhibitor VIII treatment, S14 phosphor Id2 intensity was diminished following by decrease of Akt phosphorylation in the growth cone along with a reduction of growth cone area (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D, E</a>). We added this part in the revised manuscript (subsection \u201cAkt regulates growth cone localization of Id2 in the developing neuron\u201d, last paragraph). Moreover, upon Akt inhibitor VIII treatment, S14 phosphor Id2 was diminished and followed by decreased Akt phosphorylation along with a reduction of Id2 protein whereas upon MAPK inhibitor treatment, S14 phospho Id2 level was not altered following Akt phosphorylation, indicating anti-S14-phosphor antibody specifically detect Akt-mediated phosphorylated S14 residue of Id2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). Furthermore, depletion of Akt by shRNA-Akt also led to lower intensity of S14-phosphor Id2 than observed in the control vector transfected cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C, D</a>; subsection \u201cAkt/Id2 signaling promotes axon growth by regulating growth cone development\u201d, second paragraph). Taken together, anti-S14-phosphor antibody is suitable for detecting S14 phosphorylated Id2."
