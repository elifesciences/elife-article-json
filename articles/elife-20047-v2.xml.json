Using an established, biophysically informed model of a competitive attractor network for decision making, we found that decaying tail activity from the previous trial caused choice hysteresis, especially during difficult trials, and accurately predicted human perceptual choices. In the model, choice variability could be directionally altered through amplification or dampening of post-trial activity decay through simulated depolarizing or hyperpolarizing network stimulation. An analogous intervention using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) yielded a close match between model predictions and experimental results: net soma depolarizing currents increased choice hysteresis, while hyperpolarizing currents suppressed it. Residual activity in competitive attractor networks within dlPFC may thus give rise to biases in perceptual choices, which can be directionally controlled through non-invasive brain stimulation."

For example, human and nonhuman primate value choices are subject to various biases such as framing effects (<a href=\"#bib25\">De Martino et al., 2006</a>), choice repetition biases (<a href=\"#bib73\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988</a>), sunk cost effects (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bogdanov et al., 2015</a>), and previous payoff biases (<a href=\"#bib70\">Noorbaloochi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Rorie et al., 2010</a>). These biases, which become more pronounced with difficult decisions (<a href=\"#bib32\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</a>), are also observed in human perceptual decision making (<a href=\"#bib67\">Nicolle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Noorbaloochi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Mulder et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">St John-Saaltink et al., 2016</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib1\">Akaishi et al., 2014</a>), with correlational evidence for a link between neural and choice variability (<a href=\"#bib99\">St John-Saaltink et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Hesselmann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Wyart and Tallon-Baudry, 2009</a>). Choice repetition biases are especially intriguing because they provide a window on decision making outside of the laboratory. In real life, decisions do not occur in discrete and isolated trials with long inter-trial intervals, but rather take place within the context of, and are therefore potentially biased by, previous decisions made in the immediate past."

These results have been explained by sustained recurrent activity in competitive attractor networks, which gradually returns to baseline levels following a decision, but can bias activity in the following trial in tasks with short inter-trial intervals (<a href=\"#bib92\">Rustichini and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015</a>). Indeed, a series of studies have linked perceptual and value-based decision-making with activity in such competitive attractor networks (<a href=\"#bib92\">Rustichini and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Hunt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bonaiuto and Arbib, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">H\u00e4mmerer et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Wang, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Wong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Wang, 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib103\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Mart\u00ed et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Mazurek et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Moreno-Bote et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Deco and Rolls, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Deco et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Usher and McClelland, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bogacz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Furman and Wang, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Deco et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Braun and Mattia, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Jocham et al., 2012</a>). Here, we show that carry-over activity in these networks produces a conspicuous bias to repeat difficult choices which is mirrored in the behavior of human participants. We further show that a characterization of this phenomenon in silico allows us to make directional predictions of the effects of transcranial stimulation upon choice bias which are further borne out by behavioural experiments."

We used an established and biophysically plausible model of a decision making network that employs competition between neural populations to choose between two alternate response options. Rather than simulating discrete trials and reinitializing the network state at the start of each trial, we sought to emulate the serial dependency between real world choices. We therefore ran the network in continuous blocks of trials, with the final state at the end of each trial serving as the initial state of the next trial (<a href=\"#bib92\">Rustichini and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015</a>). We confirmed that this produced choice hysteresis in the model behavior, through decaying trace activity from the previous trial biasing selection in the current trial, but only for short inter-stimulus intervals. We then conducted an analogous experiment with human participants and found a similar tendency to repeat previous choices."

We found that perturbation of the model\u2019s trace activity through simulated changes in the network\u2019s membrane potential led to predictable alterations in choice bias. In human participants, we therefore applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a region implicated in perceptual decision making (<a href=\"#bib42\">Heekeren et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Kim and Shadlen, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Heekeren et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Philiastides et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Rahnev et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Georgiev et al., 2016</a>).

Because tDCS leads to subthreshold polarization changes, we were able to subtly alter the spontaneous fluctuations in neural activity within the targeted brain region, noninvasively in our human participants (<a href=\"#bib69\">Nitsche and Paulus, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Kuo and Nitsche, 2012</a>)."

The comparison with the model suggests that this control of choice hysteresis arises from an amplification or suppression of sustained recurrent activity, which biases the following decision."

In order to analyze the behavioral output of the network, we consider a response option to be <i>chosen</i> when the corresponding pyramidal population exceeds a set <i>response threshold.</i> We measured the accuracy of the model\u2019s performance as the percentage of trials in which the chosen option corresponded to the stronger task-related input. For comparison between virtual subjects and human participants, we defined the <i>accuracy threshold</i> as the coherence level required to attain 80% accuracy. The time step at which the response threshold is exceeded is taken as the <i>decision time</i> for that trial (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

This is consistent with previous work showing that for low levels of stimulation intensity (such as that used in these simulations), the resulting shifts in membrane potential are insufficient to completely reverse the model dynamics such that it significantly alters choice accuracy (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bonaiuto and Bestmann, 2015</a>). However, we found that depolarizing stimulation decreased decision time, whilst hyperpolarization increased it (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We then analyzed the difference in decision time between no\u00a0stimulation and stimulation conditions\u00a0at each motion coherence level. In both stimulation conditions, this difference is strongest for difficult, low coherence trials, as indicated by the significant slopes in the linear fits between coherence and decision time difference (depolarizing: <i>B<sub>1</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a089.251, p=0.017; hyperpolarizing: <i>B<sub>1</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a0\u221277.327, p=0.034; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This is because during difficult trials (low coherence), shifts in membrane potential induced by depolarizing stimulation cause the winning population to reach the response threshold earlier, compared to no stimulation, while hyperpolarizing stimulation delays this event. However, during high coherence trials, the strong difference in task-related input strengths overwhelms the subtle effects of membrane potential changes. These simulations therefore predict that response time should be unaffected by subtle changes in network dynamics caused by stimulation on \u2018no brainer\u2019 trials in which strong inputs provide unequivocal evidence for one response over the other. This echoes findings from human experiments that tDCS may interact with task difficulty and/or individual differences in performance (<a href=\"#bib3\">Benwell et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Jones and Berryhill, 2012</a>). The model thus predicts that network stimulation will affect response time, especially in difficult trials, but leave accuracy largely unaffected. It is predicted that depolarizing and hyperpolarizing stimulation will lead to faster and slower responses, respectively. We obtained qualitatively similar results in simulations controlling for the input parameters and effects of stimulation on interneurons, but not those that violate the known neural effects of stimulation (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">2</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods)."

This result was echoed in a logistic regression analysis, which showed that depolarizing stimulation increased the relative influence of the previous choice to coherence (W(19)\u00a0=\u00a032, p=0.006), while hyperpolarizing stimulation reduced this ratio (W(19)\u00a0=\u00a042, p=0.019).

Moreover, depolarizing stimulation increases this residual activity, while hyperpolarizing stimulation suppresses it. These results were replicated in alternative simulations using similar assumptions about the effects of stimulation, but not in those where the initial state of the network is reset at the start of each trial, or where the effects of stimulation were qualitatively different (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods)."

We found that in trials in which the previous choice was repeated, the mean firing rate of the chosen population was slightly higher than that of the unchosen population prior to onset of task-related input (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). This effect can be attributed to decaying tail activity from the previous trial, which we refer to as <i>hysteresis bias</i>.

Pure accumulator models such as the drift diffusion model are an alternate class of decision making models that do not include mutual inhibition (<a href=\"#bib83\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib84\">1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Ratcliff, 1978</a>). In these models, separate units integrate their inputs representing evidence for the\u00a0corresponding option, and a decision is made when one unit reaches a predefined threshold. We tested whether separate integrators would make the same choice hysteresis predictions as the competitive attractor model. We split the interneuron population into two subpopulations, each exclusively connected with the corresponding pyramidal population (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The pyramidal populations could thus integrate their inputs through their recurrent excitatory connections, but could not exert any inhibitory influence on each other. All other parameters were kept the same, except for the background input firing rate and response threshold, as the resulting network became more sensitive to these values (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The accumulator version of the model made the same qualitative predictions as the competitive attractor version concerning accuracy and decision time (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>): choice accuracy is not affected by depolarizing (W(19)\u00a0=\u00a053, p=0.052) or hyperpolarizing stimulation (W(19)\u00a0=\u00a054, p=0.057), but depolarizing and hyperpolarizing stimulation speeds and slows decision time, respectively, and these effects are reduced with increasing coherence (depolarizing: <i>B<sub>1</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a0108.859, p&lt;0.001; hyperpolarizing: <i>B<sub>1</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a0\u221244.87, p=0.008). However, the model did not exhibit significant choice hysteresis (indecision point shift: W(19)\u00a0=\u00a077, p=0.296; <i>a<sub>2</sub></i>/<i>a<sub>1</sub></i>: W(19)\u00a0=\u00a086, p=0.478; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). This is because the chosen pyramidal population does not inhibit the other population, allowing decaying trace activity from both populations to extend into the next trial (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Therefore, on the next trial both populations can be similarly biased. Neither depolarizing (indecision point shift: W(19)\u00a0=\u00a054, p=0.057; <i>a<sub>2</sub></i>/<i>a<sub>1</sub></i>: W(19)\u00a0=\u00a071, p=0.204) nor hyperpolarizing stimulation (indecision point shift: W(19)\u00a0=\u00a095, p=0.709; <i>a<sub>2</sub></i>/<i>a<sub>1</sub></i>: W(19)\u00a0=\u00a085, p=0.455) had any effect on choice hysteresis."

This region is implicated in perceptual decision making, independent of stimulus and response modality (<a href=\"#bib42\">Heekeren et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">2006</a>), and it has been suggested that it operates using competitive attractor networks similar to the one we used (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bonaiuto and Arbib, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Rolls et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Compte et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Wimmer et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over this region disrupts perceptual decisions, suggesting that it plays a necessary role in this process (<a href=\"#bib76\">Philiastides et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Rahnev et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Georgiev et al., 2016</a>).

We performed the same analyses used to examine choice hysteresis in the model on behavioral data from the\u00a0human participants, now comparing each stimulation block to the preceding sham block in the same session. Exactly as predicted by the model, a shift in indecision point, which indicates a choice hysteresis effect, was observed under sham stimulation (depolarizing sham: W(23)\u00a0=\u00a079, p=0.043; hyperpolarizing sham: W(23)\u00a0=\u00a047, p=0.003), and this effect was amplified by depolarizing stimulation (W(23)\u00a0=\u00a078, p=0.04; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and reduced by hyperpolarizing stimulation (W(23)\u00a0=\u00a059, p=0.009; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), relative to the preceding sham block. The results of the logistic regression confirmed these results, with a nonzero ratio of the influence of the previous choice to that of the current coherence in the sham stimulation blocks (depolarizing sham: W(23)\u00a0=\u00a073, p=0.028; hyperpolarizing sham: W(23)\u00a0=\u00a047, p=0.003), which was increased by depolarizing (W(23)\u00a0=\u00a056, p=0.007; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) and decreased by hyperpolarizing stimulation (W(23)\u00a0=\u00a078, p=0.04; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) relative to the preceding sham block. We therefore found that in both the model and in human participants, polarization of the dlPFC led to changes in reaction times and choice hysteresis effects in a perceptual decision making task. The neural dynamics of the model suggest that these changes are explained by alterations of sustained recurrent activity following a trial, which biases the decision process in the next trial."

Recent work has started to illuminate possible mechanisms for choice hysteresis biases and their neural correlates, but the putative neural mechanisms and dynamics underlying these biases have not been investigated with a causal approach in humans. We here used tDCS, a noninvasive neurostimulation technique, over left dlPFC to provide subtle perturbations of neural network dynamics while participants performed a perceptual decision making task. We leveraged recent developments in computational modeling approaches that bridge between the physiological and behavioral consequences of tDCS (<a href=\"#bib41\">H\u00e4mmerer et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Bonaiuto and Bestmann, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Fr\u00f6hlich, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bestmann, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">de Berker et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Ruzzoli et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Neggers et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hartwigsen\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bestmann et al., 2015</a>) to generate behavioral predictions about how the gentle perturbation of network dynamics might impact behavior. To this end, we simulated the impact of tDCS in an established biophysical attractor model of dlPFC function. We show that carry-over activity from previous trials biases the activity of the network in the current trial, thus introducing a tendency to repeat the previous choice when the current one is difficult. Stimulation modulates the rate at which this carry-over activity decays, thus amplifying or suppressing choice hysteresis in the same way we observed in healthy participants undergoing analogous stimulation over dlPFC."

Our modeling results suggest that stimulation over this region changes the level of sustained recurrent activity, and that this change modulates both choice variability and decision time. A competing accumulator version of our model that included integration without competition did not exhibit choice hysteresis. More generally, our approach demonstrates that a linkage between computational modeling and noninvasive brain stimulation allows mechanistic accounts of brain function to be causally tested."

This effect diminished with longer ISIs which allowed the tail activity to fully decay. Simulation of depolarizing noninvasive brain stimulation in this model decreased decision time and amplified this choice hysteresis effect, while hyperpolarizing stimulation increased decision time and suppressed choice hysteresis. These behavioral effects were caused by changes in the level of sustained activity from the previous trial, placing the network closer or further away to one of its attractor states, biasing the response to one or the other option, thus speeding or slowing decisions. Human participants demonstrated the same choice hysteresis bias, which was diminished with longer ISIs (but see\u00a0<a href=\"#bib1\">Akaishi et al., 2014</a>)\u00a0and modulated by noninvasive brain stimulation over the left dlPFC in the same way.

This is not surprising, given the effects of stimulation on decision time and the use of a firing rate threshold as a decision criterion. However, in previous studies with a similar model we found that decision making accuracy is affected at higher levels of stimulation intensity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bonaiuto and Bestmann, 2015</a>). The stimulation intensities used in the present simulations were matched to those used in the human experiments, and not sufficiently high to polarize the network enough to completely override differences in task-related inputs (left/right motion coherence). Previous work has shown that repetitive TMS over left dlPFC reduces both accuracy and increases response time in a similar task (<a href=\"#bib76\">Philiastides et al., 2011</a>). However, TMS elicits instantaneous synchronized activity within the area of stimulation, and thus likely disrupts ongoing activity, providing an \u2018override\u2019 of difference in task-related inputs. By contrast, tDCS subtly alters neural dynamics through small de- or hyper-polarizing currents without directly eliciting spikes (<a href=\"#bib79\">Radman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bikson et al., 2013</a>). With the number of trials used and the variability observed in the present task, it is likely that stimulation effects were only apparent in response time because response time is a more sensitive performance metric than choice accuracy. More generally, our results show that the possible mechanisms through which non-invasive brain stimulation alters behavior can be interrogated through the use of biologically informed computational modeling approaches. Computational neurostimulation of the kind employed here may thus provide an important development for mechanistically informed rationales for the application of neurostimulation in both health and disease."

We also used individual structural MRIs to optimize electrode placement for each participant, using relatively small stimulation electrodes that straddled our target site in left dlPFC. Specifically, electrode positions relative to the MNI template were determined using current modeling to maximize current flow <i>through</i> the superior frontal sulcus portion of the left dlPFC, creating radial inward or outward current flow. Each participant\u2019s MRI was aligned to the template and the inverse of this transformation was used to derive optimal electrode positions to generate current flow through the same sulcus. This approach ensured that stimulation was relatively confined over left prefrontal cortex, and that the direction of current flow through the target site was comparable across subjects. However, in our simulations neurons were not spatially localized and polarization was applied uniformly to all neurons within a population. Future computational neurostimulation studies should investigate the effects of heterogeneous polarization due to variable patterns of current flow through brain tissue."

However, the left dlPFC is an attractive target for our aims for a number of reasons. The activity of neurons in dlPFC both predicts the upcoming response and reflects information about the sensory stimuli, suggesting that this region makes an integral contribution to transforming sensory information into a decision (<a href=\"#bib54\">Kim and Shadlen, 1999</a>). Furthermore, in human perceptual decision making, left dlPFC is activated independent of the both the stimulus type and response modality (<a href=\"#bib42\">Heekeren et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Pleger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Wenzlaff et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Ruff et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Philiastides and Sajda, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Donner et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Ostwald et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>), and has been shown to play a causal role in the process (<a href=\"#bib76\">Philiastides et al., 2011</a>). We optimized the electrode locations to stimulate the left dlPFC, while leaving premotor and motor cortices unaffected, as stimulation of these regions could induce response biases. This may not have been possible with stimulation over parietal cortex. Finally, neural hysteresis in another frontal region, orbitofrontal cortex, has been linked to behavioral choice hysteresis in value-based decisions in nonhuman primates (<a href=\"#bib73\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</a>). Recent work suggests that this region can indeed be targeted with tDCS (<a href=\"#bib41\">H\u00e4mmerer et al., 2016</a>), and whether choice hysteresis for value-based decision can be similarly molded as in the present study remains to be seen. However, decaying trace activity in left dlPFC could partially reflect lingering activity in afferent regions, and this possibility could be addressed in future research using a multiregional computational neurostimulation approach."

However, compared to the competitive attractor model, the accumulator model made very similar predictions concerning choice accuracy and decision time, as well as the effects of stimulation on these measures. In our simulations, the lack of mutual inhibition in the accumulator model allows residual activity from both pyramidal populations to bias the following decision, resulting in zero net bias. In constructing the accumulator model, we sought to alter the competitive attractor model as little as possible, keeping most parameters at the same value. However, we found that without mutual inhibition, the firing rates of the resulting network were much more sensitive to the noisy background inputs, and therefore we had to restrict the range of background\u00a0firing\u00a0rates used and scale the response threshold accordingly. It is possible that there are some sets of parameter values that would cause the accumulator model to exhibit choice hysteresis, but a systematic search of the parameter space of this model is beyond the scope of this study."

The choice hysteresis behavior in human participants qualitatively matched that of the model, but the model predicted a larger effect than that observed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>). Factors such as the contribution of other brain regions known to be involved in perceptual decision making may explain these quantitative differences.

Additionally, we used computational neurostimulation of this model to predict the effect of tDCS over left dlPFC on choice hysteresis, which we then confirmed experimentally. Previous work showing that changes to parameters in diffusion models can explain differences in human perceptual decision making after transcranial magnetic stimulation of left dlPFC (<a href=\"#bib76\">Philiastides et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Rahnev et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Georgiev et al., 2016</a>). Our results extend these findings by addressing the neural circuitry behind perceptual decision making processes. This allows us to capture the influence of previous neural activity on the current choice in a natural way, and to offer mechanistic explanations for the effects of stimulation on neural dynamics in the left dlPFC. We provide interventional evidence that the left dlPFC integrates and compares perceptual information through competitive interactions between neural populations, and that decaying trace activity from previous trials influences the current choice by biasing the decision toward the repeating the last choice."

Importantly, the sum of the mean task-related input rates always equals 80 Hz, meaning that decision making behavior has to emerge from network dynamics and input structure and cannot be attributed to differences in the overall level of task-related input stimulation. The firing rate of each task-related input at each time point was normally distributed around the mean (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a04 Hz) and changed according to the\u00a0refresh rate of the\u00a0monitor used in our experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, left column).

The winner-take-all dynamic of the network causes the firing rates of the pyramidal populations to magnify differences in the inputs.

As the firing rate of one population increases, it increasingly inhibits the other population via the common pool of inhibitory interneurons. This further increases the activity of the winning population as the inhibitory activity caused by the other population decreases. These competitive dynamics result in one pyramidal population (typically the one receiving the strongest input) firing at a relatively high rate, while the firing rate of the other population decreases to approximately 0 Hz (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Virtual subjects were generated using a random seed to generate fine grained neuron-to-neuron connectivity using the connection probabilities described above. Each virtual subject had a background input firing rate sampled from a range (880\u2013950 Hz) previously used to simulate human participants in a similar decision making task (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bonaiuto and Bestmann, 2015</a>) and a response threshold uniformly sampled from a range of 18\u201322 Hz to capture inter-subject differences in speed-accuracy tradeoffs. Simulations with the accumulator version of the model used a background rate between 855 Hz and 870 Hz and a response threshold that varied with the rate in the range 19\u201336 Hz.

Participants sat comfortably at a desk in front of a computer and responded to visual stimuli displayed on a screen by pressing two keys on a keyboard using the index and middle finger of their right hand. The screen had an update rate of 60 Hz and was placed 76 cm from the participants. On each trial, participants were required to fixate in the center of a screen. After 500 ms a RDK was displayed and participants were required to press a key as soon as possible to indicate whether the direction of coherent motion was to the left or the right (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Although only one direction of coherent motion was displayed during each trial, the task is a two alternative forced choice task, and therefore evidence must be accumulated and a decision made between the left and right direction. The RDK consisted of a 5\u00b0 diameter circular aperture centered on the fixation point (<a href=\"#bib93\">Ruzzoli et al., 2010</a>) with 0.1\u00b0 diameter dots at a density of 16.7 dots/deg<sup>2</sup>/s (<a href=\"#bib18\">Britten et al., 1992</a>), each moving at 5\u00b0/s (<a href=\"#bib61\">McGovern et al., 2012</a>). The percentage of coherently moving dots was set randomly in each trial to 3.2, 6.4, 12.8, 25.6, or 51.2%. Trials ended once a response had been made or after a maximum of 1s if no response was made. The inter-trial interval was 1\u20132s and varied depending on the response time of the previous trial to make all trials the same length. Combined with the 500 ms fixation period, ISIs were therefore between 1.5 and 2.5s. Matching the model simulations, each block contained 10 trials for each coherence level with half containing coherent leftward motion and half rightward (100 trials total). All trials were randomly ordered. Participants were shown cumulative feedback at the end of each block displaying % correct, the mean response time in the most difficult trials, and # correct responses / minute. Before each session, participants completed a training block in which trial-by-trial feedback was given during the first ten trials. We used a within-subject design in which each participant completed three sessions (depolarizing stimulation; hyperpolarizing stimulation; no stimulation; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The order of the stimulation conditions was balanced across participants. The human behavioral task was implemented in Python using PsychoPy v1.78.01 (<a href=\"#bib75\">Peirce, 2007</a>)."

Inward/anodal (relative to the cortical sulcal surface) currents have an opposite effect on neural polarization to outward/cathodal currents (<a href=\"#bib81\">Rahman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Bonaiuto and Bestmann, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bestmann et al., 2015</a>). Placing the cathode electrode in the medial position and the anodal electrode in the lateral position maximized outward (cathodal) current, while the opposite configuration maximized inward current (anodal) flow through the target site (<a href=\"#bib81\">Rahman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bikson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Radman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Basser and Roth, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Reato et al., 2010</a>)."

In the first session, participants completed three blocks of 100 trials each with three short breaks. Each block lasted 20 min. During each session with stimulation (depolarizing or hyperpolarizing with the session order balanced across participants), participants completed two blocks of trials with sham stimulation, and one with depolarizing or hyperpolarizing stimulation. The first block was always sham and the order of the second and third blocks was balanced across participants and stimulation conditions. This within-subjects design was chosen to maximize statistical power and control for learning effects, as we found in a pilot study that performance on the task improved between sessions as well as between blocks within a session. Behavior from each stimulation block was compared with the sham block directly preceding it in the same session, controlling for both within- and between-session learning. During stimulation blocks, tDCS was applied for 20 min at 2 mA. During sham blocks the stimulation was ramped up to 2mA over 10\u00a0s, stimulated for 30\u00a0s, and then ramped down to 0 over 10\u00a0s."

To test this model prediction, we conducted a control experiment using the same task as that in the main experiment, with the exception that the inter-trial intervals were either 1 or 4.5 s long. Combined with the 500 ms fixation duration, this resulted in ISIs of either 1.5 or 5 s and these were randomized within blocks. Following a training block in which trial-by-trial feedback was given, participants completed three test blocks without feedback. Each test block contained 20 trials for each combination of ISI and coherence level, with half containing coherent leftward motion and half rightward (200 trials total per block). All trials were randomly ordered. The analysis was performed on all test blocks."

Wilcoxon tests for comparing two repeated measures were used to compare the accuracy thresholds in each stimulation condition to the no stimulation condition in virtual subjects, and in each stimulation block to the preceding sham block in the same session in human participants.

This paper provides a nice blend of theoretical and experimental work to demonstrate the possible neural bases for one form of response bias, namely that observed from trial to trial. The authors employ a rather detailed biophysical model but the core idea here is quite simple-residual activity in the decision units will influence decisions on subsequent trials. This effect will be most pronounced on difficult decisions, mainly because easy decisions rise very quickly to threshold. The authors perform a tDCS experiment to show a similar pattern of behavior in humans, with a greater carryover effect following depolarized stimulation arrangement and reduced carryover following hyperpolarized arrangement."

Because the pyramidal populations inhibit each other via the common pool of interneurons, it is not possible to directly remove mutual inhibition. We therefore constructed an accumulator version of our model by splitting the inhibitory interneuron populations into two subpopulations, each connected only with the corresponding pyramidal population (subsection \u201cControl simulations: Accumulator with independent interneuron pools\u201d, first paragraph). This way the pyramidal populations could not exert any inhibitory influence on each other. We found that the model made predictions similar to those made by the competitive attractor model in terms of the effects of stimulation on accuracy and decision time, but it did not exhibit any choice hysteresis behavior. This was because without mutual inhibition between the two pyramidal populations, activity from both pyramidal populations carried over to the next trial, rather than just activity from the winning population. This reduced the net bias exerted on the decision since both pyramidal populations were similarly biased. We sought to keep the accumulator version of the model as similar to the competitive attractor version as possible to ensure a fair comparison. However, the accumulator version was highly sensitive to the background firing rate and response threshold levels and we therefore had to restrict the ranges of these parameters when instantiating virtual subjects. It is therefore still possible that some other set of model parameters would give rise to choice hysteresis, but this would be beyond the scope of this paper. We also note that removing inhibition in a different way, by removing the projections from the pyramidal populations to the inhibitory population caused the network to become unstable and extremely sensitive to its inputs."

Participants responded using only their right hand, which was thus contralateral to the site of stimulation, and stimuli were presented in the center of the visual field. This is the same as in Philiastides et al. (2011) who also targeted the left dlPFC with TMS during perceptual decision making. Our study therefore cannot address potential bilaterality of dlPFC organization. However, in nonhuman primates, dlPFC neurons are active during perceptual decision making whether the decision is indicated with a button press (Hussar & Pasternak, 2013) or a saccade (Kiani, Cueva, Reppas, & Newsome, 2014; Kim & Shadlen, 1999; Opris & Bruce, 2005). In humans, the left dlPFC is active during tasks using right-handed (Donner et al., 2007; Heekeren, Marrett, Bandettini, & Ungerleider, 2004; Heekeren, Marrett, Ruff, Bandettini, & Ungerleider, 2006; Philiastides & Sajda, 2007; Ruff, Marrett, Heekeren, Bandettini, & Ungerleider, 2010) or left-handed (Pleger et al., 2006) button presses, as well as saccades (Heekeren et al., 2006) to indicate the choice. Wenzlaff et al. (2011) used a perceptual decision making task in which subjects indicated one choice with the left hand and the other with the right and found that the left dlPFC reflected accumulated sensory evidence. This suggests that the left dlPFC is involved in perceptual decision making independent of response modality (e.g. it is activated when responding with the eyes and with the hands) or laterality (e.g. it is involved in decisions indicated with both the left and right hand). We are therefore confident that stimulation of left dlPFC would affect both hands equally, but we have added a discussion of this point to the subsection \u201cStudy Limitations\u201d (fourth paragraph)."
