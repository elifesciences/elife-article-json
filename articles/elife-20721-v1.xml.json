Using in vitro electrophysiological paired recordings we reveal that in the mouse basal amygdala cholecystokinin- and parvalbumin-containing basket cells provide equally potent control of principal neuron spiking. We performed pharmacological manipulations, light and electron microscopic investigations to show that, although basket cells innervate the entire somato-denditic membrane surface of principal neurons, the spike controlling effect is achieved primarily via the minority of synapses targeting the perisomatic region. As the innervation patterns of individual basket cells on their different postsynaptic partners show high variability, the impact of inhibitory control accomplished by single basket cells is also variable. Our results show that both basket cell types can powerfully regulate the activity in amygdala networks predominantly via their perisomatic synapses."

                        "text": "Perisomatic region of cortical principal neurons (PNs), comprising the cell body, proximal dendrites and the axon initial segment, is a subcellular domain that is a critical site for the input integration and for the generation of the action potential, the output of neurons. Inhibitory inputs arriving onto this region are in a position to powerfully regulate the firing of individual PNs and to synchronize the activity of large neuronal ensembles, leading to an efficient control of neural processing within local networks (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buhl et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cobb et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Miles et al., 1996</a>). Two major types of GABAergic cells are known to innervate the perisomatic region in all cortical areas: axo-axonic cells form synapses exclusively on the axon initial segment of PNs, while basket cells (BCs) target the soma and proximal dendrites (<a href=\"#bib49\">Somogyi et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Somogyi, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Veres et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Guly\u00e1s et al., 1993</a>). The latter interneuron type is usually divided into two groups by the mutually exclusive expression of neurochemical markers: the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) and the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK). By having distinct functional characteristics, the two types of basket cells have been proposed to contribute differently to network operations (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armstrong and Soltesz, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bartos and Elgueta, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Freund and Katona, 2007</a>). Parvalbumin-containing basket cells (PVBCs) play a primary role in controlling and synchronizing the firing of PNs in large ensembles during distinct brain states (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sohal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stark et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schlingloff et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Guly\u00e1s et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tukker et al., 2013</a>) as well as in gain control of sensory processes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Atallah et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, due to the lack of selective genetic tools, much less is known about the function of cholecystokinin-expressing basket cells (CCKBCs). In an influential review it has been proposed that these GABAergic cells may provide a modulatory effect on network dynamics conveying information from subcortical areas about emotional, motivational and general physiological states (<a href=\"#bib14\">Freund and Katona, 2007</a>), a hypothesis that has not been challenged yet."

Their dendritic shafts, however, are targeted by different interneurons expressing PV or CCK, whose axonal arbor largely avoids the pyramidal cell layer (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buhl et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Halasy et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cope et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Szab\u00f3 et al., 2014</a>). The structural segregation of axon clouds of PV- and CCK-expressing GABAergic cells targeting distinct functional (perisomatic vs. dendritic) domains of pyramidal cells secures the division of labor between perisomatic and dendrite-targeting interneurons in the hippocampus. Perisomatic inhibitory interneurons effectively control the output, the spiking of pyramidal cells, while the dendritic interneurons regulate their input properties (<a href=\"#bib34\">Miles et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pouille et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">M\u00fcllner et al., 2015</a>). This clear structural arrangement in axonal projections of interneurons is lacking in other cortical regions, and single BCs can innervate both the perisomatic region of PNs as well as their more distal dendrites (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jiang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kubota et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1998</a>). This latter finding, however, has been demonstrated so far only for PVBCs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kubota et al., 2015</a>). These results obtained in neocortical areas raise three major questions: (i) is the potency of PVBCs and CCKBCs to regulate PN spiking similar or distinct, (ii) what is the relative contribution of perisomatic vs. dendritic synapses of BCs to the control of PN spiking, and (iii) is the innervation pattern and therefore the inhibitory efficacy of single BCs uniform on their different postsynaptic partners?"

Previous studies established that similar types of interneurons can be found in this region as in other cortical regions, including the two types of BCs as well as axo-axonic cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Katona et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">McDonald and Betette, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sah et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Spampanato et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bienvenu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Vereczki et al., 2016</a>). Using in vitro paired recordings, pharmacological manipulations and correlated light and electron microscopy we found that the two BC types could inhibit PNs with the same efficacy and innervated the same somato-dendritic membrane surface of their postsynaptic partners. Besides innervating the perisomatic region, both BC types also formed many synaptic contacts on distal dendrites at various ratios, however, the main determinant of the efficacy of their spike inhibition was the number of the synaptic contacts targeting the perisomatic region."

Importantly, the latency of the signals indicated the monosynaptic nature of the connections from both cell types, however, IPSCs originating from PVBCs had significantly shorter latencies than those from CCKBCs. The failure rate, potency and amplitude of the first IPSC were not significantly different. The events arriving from PVBCs had faster rise time but similar decay time. In addition, there was a significant difference in the short-term plasticity of the signals: IPSCs originating from PVBCs onto PNs showed uniformly a marked depression, while those arising from CCKBCs were more variable and showed only a slight depression on average. Importantly, the charge transfer of the IPSCs and the area of IPSPs evoked by the two BCs in response to three action potentials at 30 Hz were not significantly different.

When we compared the inhibitory efficacy of CCKBCs and PVBCs (i.e. 1- the probability of PN spiking in the presence of BC firing) we could not find significant differences. Both BC types could silence their postsynaptic partners with\u00a0~75% probability on average (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, in both cell types there were BCs, which could veto PN firing with very high probability (&gt;95% inhibitory efficacy, 42% of CCKBCs and 45% of PVBCs, n\u00a0=\u00a08 and 9, respectively), whereas others had only a weak inhibitory efficacy (&lt;50% inhibitory efficacy, 21% of CCKBCs and 20% of PVBCs, n\u00a0=\u00a04 and 4, respectively). Those BCs that gave rise to IPSPs with larger area had a more pronounced inhibitory effect on their postsynaptic partner\u2019s spiking (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Although from the physiological point of view, the IPSP area is the most relevant factor determining the inhibitory efficacy of an interneuron, the low signal to noise ratio and the fluctuating membrane potentials make the postsynaptic potentials less precisely detectable in comparison to IPSCs obtained in voltage-clamp mode. Therefore, we used the charge transfer of IPSCs as the key electrophysiological property at a BC-PN connection, which correlated well with the IPSP area (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) and similarly related to the inhibitory efficacy of BCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>)."

We observed that IPSPs which failed to veto PN firing, could still alter the timing of the spike, delaying it by up to 38.5 ms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013I</a>). The maximal delay caused by the two BC types was not significantly different (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). We tested the importance of the timing of IPSPs by stimulating the presynaptic BC at different time points relative to the peak of the sinusoidal current evoking action potentials in the PN and measuring the caused delay in PN firing. We found that both cell types could control the firing of PNs in a\u00a0~110 ms-long time window (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>), with increased delaying effect in PN firing as the IPSP arrived closer to the sinusoidal cycle peak (i.e. to the theoretical time of the spike). These results together showed that inhibitory inputs from CCKBCs and PVBCs had the same powerful potential to postpone PN spiking."

Importantly, the ratio of the perisomatic region-targeting boutons was variable and showed a continuous distribution across the populations of both cell types.

What is the contribution of perisomatic region- vs. dendrite-targeting boutons to control PN spike generation? Several lines of investigations have been performed to address this question. By analyzing the potential relationship between the electrophysiological properties of inhibitory connections and their underlying structural features, we found that the amplitude of the first IPSC is correlated with the number of the perisomatic boutons, but not with the total number of contacts (n\u00a0=\u00a020 CCKBC and 19 PVBC pairs, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>). The charge transfer of three IPSCs also showed higher correlation with the number of perisomatic contacts than with the total number of contacts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>). Moreover, the inhibitory efficacy of both BCs may depend more on the number of perisomatic synapses than the total number of synapses as suggested by <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013H</a>. The correlation of the electrophysiological and morphological data suggested that the most determining factor of the inhibitory efficacy is the number of the contacts established on the perisomatic region of PNs."

As we showed earlier, the number of perisomatic contacts is the major determinant of the inhibitory efficacy of a BC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), implying that BCs with different amount of perisomatic contacts may have a substantially different power to regulate PN activity. This raises the question whether, like in the hippocampus, there are BCs, which can be classified as \u2018classical\u2019 perisomatic region-targeting cells, because they innervate predominantly the perisomatic region of all of their postsynaptic partners, thereby potently controlling their spiking. Accordingly, other cells might be classified as dendrite-targeting interneurons, innervating mostly the dendritic shafts of PNs, having a less powerful effect on spike generation. Alternatively, a BC expressing PV or CCK could innervate some of their postsynaptic partners mainly at their perisomatic region, whereas other PNs could receive inputs from the same interneuron mainly on the dendrites, which would imply that a BC has a different inhibitory effect on its distinct postsynaptic partners. To address this question, we analyzed the target distribution of single biocytin-labeled BCs along the entire somato-dendritic membrane surface of three sequentially recorded and labeled postsynaptic PNs with the same method as used in the paired recordings (n\u00a0=\u00a08 CCKBC-PNs and 5 PVBC-PNs quadruplets, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We found that in some cases the innervation patterns from one BC to three distinct PNs were similar, i.e. innervating mainly the perisomatic region (e.g. quadruplet #4 in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) or more distal dendritic regions (e.g. quadruplet #8 in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). However, there were some cases, where the same BCs innervated the soma of one postsynaptic PN with multiple contacts, whereas targeted only the dendrites of another PN (e.g. quadruplet #3 and 5 in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Similarly, some BCs innervated the perisomatic region of different postsynaptic PNs with similar number of terminals (e.g. quadruplet # one in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, ranging from 0 to 2), while targeting others with variable number of terminals (e.g. quadruplet #3 in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>, ranging from 0 to 8). These data indicated that the innervation patterns of both CCKBCs and PVBCs could be highly variable and show a continuum in respect to the ratio of perisomatic contacts, if we evaluated the target distribution on multiple PNs."

This approach allowed us to investigate the number and distribution of contacts from the presynaptic BCs both on a postsynaptic PN labeled with Alexa 488 in paired recordings and on the perisomatic region of 10\u201320 neighboring Kv2.1-immunolabeled cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>, n\u00a0=\u00a015 CCKBC-PN and 6 PVBC-PN pairs). Since the analysis of paired recordings showed no difference in the innervation patterns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013J</a>), data form CCKBCs and PVBCs were pooled. We found that the number of perisomatic contacts from individual BCs was very variable on the Kv2.1-labeled profiles (ranging from 1 to 12 per Kv2.1-labeled cell, CV\u00a0=\u00a00.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), and showed no correlation with the number of perisomatic contacts on the intracellularly-labeled postsynaptic PN (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Moreover, from these datasets we could also determine the ratio of the contacts on Kv2.1-labeled perisomatic- and on unlabeled, presumably distal dendritic regions, thereby calculating the average perisomatic target ratio for single BCs at the population level (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). The ratio of the contacts targeting the perisomatic region (i.e. on Kv2.1-labeled soma and proximal dendrites) was variable (CCKBCs: 48.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1%, range: 16.5\u201381.1%; PVBCs: 51.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5%, range: 17.4\u201384.9%) and formed a continuous distribution for both BC types (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). We found no correlation between the ratio of perisomatic contacts obtained at the population level and those observed in the paired recordings (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, the relationship between the average number of perisomatic contacts on Kv2.1-labeled profiles and the average ratio of perisomatic contacts at the population level (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) implied that those cells that tend to target the perisomatic region at higher ratio at the population level, they also form more contacts on this membrane region of individual target cells (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). This feature enables the BCs with high ratio of perisomatic contacts to control the spiking activity of the postsynaptic cells more effectively. These data together indicate that both CCKBCs and PVBCs tend to target the perisomatic region of PNs as a population, however, there is a marked variability in the number and ratio of the perisomatic contacts of individual BCs targeting different PNs, implying a variable inhibitory effect on distinct postsynaptic partners. Moreover, our data show that due to this variability it is not possible to determine the characteristic innervation pattern and inhibitory efficacy of a given BC based on the bouton distribution on a single postsynaptic partner, rather investigation of the target distribution at the population level is needed."

Analogous to what was found in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib53\">Szab\u00f3 et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Glickfeld and Scanziani, 2006</a>), some characteristics of the output synapses of CCKBCs and PVBCs are slightly different, yet the efficacy of control these GABAergic cells exhibit on PN firing is surprisingly similar. Both cell types gave rise to synaptic currents with fast rise time, indicating the perisomatic origin of the postsynaptic events recorded in the PNs. Interestingly, although the rise time of the events originating from the CCKBCs was significantly slower, the location of their synapses was not distinct from those of PVBCs. This data indicates that the difference in rise times might derive from the spatiotemporal profile of neurotransmitter release, as it was described in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bucurenciu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lenkey et al., 2015</a>). The distinct release machinery might also be responsible for the observed differences in the latency of the responses. In our study, we tested the inhibitory efficacy by evoking three action potentials, which is an in vivo relevant activity pattern in the basolateral complex of the amygdala (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bienvenu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wolff et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, this firing at 30 Hz induced a marked difference in the short-term plasticity of IPSCs at the output synapses of the two BC types, yet the IPSP areas recorded in the PNs had the same magnitude."

We found that both types of BCs innervated the perisomatic and the distal dendritic compartments up to 320 \u00b5m far from the soma (i.e. till the end of PN dendrites, see also small caliber dendrite innervation by PVBCs reported in (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bienvenu et al., 2012</a>). This innervation pattern resembles the properties of neocortical basket cells, as they also innervate distal dendritic regions of PNs with several synapses (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tam\u00e1s et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kubota et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kisv\u00e1rday et al., 2002</a>). The functional implication of the presence of both somatic and dendritic inhibitory inputs from the same cell requires more investigations, however, BCs in the BA -besides controlling action potential generation and somatic signal integration (present study)- might be able to influence local dendritic computations by innervating distal dendritic segments (<a href=\"#bib36\">M\u00fcllner et al., 2015</a>). Our results thus may suggest that in the neocortical and amygdalar microcircuits, in sharp contrast to that observed in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib34\">Miles et al., 1996</a>), BCs might have a dual function, as their output synapses are in the position to control both the input and output features of PNs."

Although a tendency could be observed that PVBCs might establish more contacts than CCKBCs, the inhibitory efficacy of these two cell populations was similar, which can be, at least partially, explained by the fact that the presence of multiple release sites at the axon terminals of CCKBCs in the BA (as in other cortical regions) is typical (<a href=\"#bib24\">Katona et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yoshida et al., 2011</a>). In this study we used DAB/DAB-Ni labelling for EM level analysis, which didn't allow the recognition and separation of discrete release sites (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bir\u00f3 et al., 2006</a>), thus the potential difference in the transmitter release site number between CCKBCs and PVBCs could not have been directly addressed."

Between these two extremes, the innervation patterns of BCs formed a continuum, therefore categorization of these interneurons into perisomatic and dendrite-targeting cells expressing PV and CCK like in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cope et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Buhl et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Szab\u00f3 et al., 2014</a>) is not possible in the BA. When we analyzed the target distribution of single BCs on multiple postsynaptic cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), we found the same continuous innervation pattern, i.e. only a few percent of the BCs formed synapses with the very same distribution on all of their postsynaptic partners. What can be the reason for the high variability in innervation pattern of single BCs? Recent studies suggested that the BA PN populations show heterogeneity regarding their different afferent and efferent connections that may allow them to play distinct roles in BA functions (<a href=\"#bib21\">Herry et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Senn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Namburi et al., 2015</a>). These PN types are intermingled within the BA, but they might be distinctly controlled by local interneurons, as it has been shown in the hippocampus or neocortex (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Varga et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bodor et al., 2005</a>). However, a recent elegant study showed that PNs projecting to different prefrontal cortical areas receive uniform synaptic inhibition from CCKBCs (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vogel et al., 2016</a>). Thus, in the BA, projection area of PNs might not determine the level of inhibitory control they receive from individual BCs, at least from those expressing CB<sub>1</sub> receptors. Although a similar study has not been conducted for PVBCs, the heterogeneity of the innervation pattern observed in the present work may not be primarily defined by the subtypes of PNs projecting to different regions, a hypothesis that need to be addressed in future investigations."

As fear learning can be bidirectionally regulated by optogenetic manipulation of the activity of PV-containing interneurons in the BA (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wolff et al., 2014</a>), our data suggests that the effect of manipulation of CCKBC functions at the behavioral level might be comparable to that observed in the case of PV-expressing interneurons on the BA network output."

Several lines of evidence suggest that these interneuron types might play different roles during BA network activities and therefore in emotional information processing. For instance, how these interneuron types can be recruited by local PNs is markedly different. Morphological data (<a href=\"#bib46\">Smith et al., 2000</a>) and unpublished observations from our lab showed that AACs and PVBCs are heavily innervated by local PNs, whereas CCKBCs lack the strong local feedback excitation. These results imply that AACs and PVBCs might be involved in local feedback inhibitory circuits, and shape the firing of PNs even at low or moderate network activity levels. On the other hand, local PNs may recruit CCKBCs to provide feedback inhibition only when the BA network activity is elevated, or together with a concomitant activation of extra-amygdalar, e.g. subcortical afferents."

To record postsynaptic inhibitory potentials (IPSPs), presynaptic cell was stimulated in the same way, and the postsynaptic PN was held in current clamp mode at around \u221255 mV. Bridge balance was adjusted throughout the recordings. Kinetic properties of IPSCs and IPSPs were analyzed on averaged events that were calculated excluding the transmission failures. The latency of synaptic transmission was calculated by subtracting the time of the action potential peaks from the onset of the postsynaptic currents. The potency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC potency) is calculated as the average amplitude of the events excluding failures."

We chose this protocol as it has been shown that PNs in the amygdala display intrinsic membrane potential oscillations at theta frequencies in vivo, a rhythm that can facilitate theta frequency modulated periodic firing (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pape et al., 1998</a>). The membrane potential of PNs was set (approximately around \u221255 mV) such to evoke a spike at the peak of the sinusoidal current pulses with the amplitude of 50 pA, but not of 30 pA. This adjustment maintained the membrane potential of PNs near the spiking threshold. One trial consisted of 7 sinusoidal waves (5\u00d750 pA and 2\u00d730 pA), repeated 10\u201320 times in each pair. Three action potentials at 30 Hz were evoked in the interneuron by brief square current pulses (2 ms, 1.5\u20132 nA) before the fourth sinusoidal wave (50 pA) in each trial. To calculate the reduction in firing probability, the firing probability of PNs under control conditions was calculated from the average of the responses to 50 pA currents (1 st, third, fifth and sixth sinusoidal wave), which was compared to that obtained during the fourth cycle. The inhibitory efficacy shows the probability of the suppression of action potential generation in the PN by BC firing (i.e.: 1- [PN firing probability during the control sinusoidal current cycles - firing probability when the BC is stimulated]). To test the ability of BCs to postpone PN firing, the timing of BC stimulation was systematically shifted with 10 ms steps relative to the peak of the sinusoidal current cycles."

Briefly, the same K-gluconate based intrapipette solution was used for whole-cell recordings (see above) containing 100 \u00b5g/ml gramicidin, 100 \u03bcM Alexa 488 hydrazide sodium salt and 1 mM QX-314 (Sigma) in addition. The tip of the pipette was filled with gramicidin free solution and then backfilled with the gramicidin containing intrapipette solution. The series resistance was monitored throughout the experiment, and recordings were started when the resistance fell below 100 M\u03a9. Pipette capacitance was neutralized and bridge balance was carefully adjusted throughout the recordings. Patch rupture was detected by (i) the inability to evoke action potentials with depolarizing current steps (the consequence of the Na+/K+ channel blocker QX-314 diffusion into the cell), (ii) with the penetration of Alexa 488 dye into the cell, or (iii) sudden drop of the access resistance, and in such cases the experiment was terminated. To estimate the reversal potential of the evoked postsynaptic responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I\u2013K</a>), we plotted the area (integral) of IPSPs as a function of membrane potential and obtained the value, where the second order polynomial fit crossed the x axis. For comparing the reversal potential of IPSPs in perforated patch and whole-cell mode, we compared the responses from the same presynaptic IN onto a PN recorded in perforated patch mode and a neighboring PN recorded in whole-cell mode."

Slices were then washed out with PB several times, and incubated in cryoprotective solution (30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB) for 2 hr, and then freeze-thawed three times above liquid nitrogen. BCs were visualized using Alexa 594 or Alexa 647-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000\u20131:3000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), whereas PNs were labeled using rabbit anti-Alexa 488 primary antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200, Invitrogen). Amplification of the original Alexa488 signal with subsequent immunolabeling ensured that the fluorescent signal in the postsynaptic PNs had significantly higher intensity than the eGFP signal in neighboring PV-eGFP cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) which could have interfered with PN cell reconstruction. Confocal images were collected using a Nikon A1R microscope fitted with an oil immersion apochromatic lens (CFI Super Plan Fluor 20X objective, N.A. 0.45; z step size: 0.8\u20131 \u03bcm, xy: 0.31 \u03bcm/pixel). Based on the confocal images the postsynaptic PN was fully reconstructed in 3D with the Neurolucida 10.53 software and the putative synaptic sites from the presynaptic BC were marked. For the detailed analysis of the contacts, higher magnification images were taken with the same microscope (CFI Plan Apo VC60X Oil objective, z step size: 0.13 \u03bcm, xy: 0.08 \u03bcm/pixel). Only those recordings were used for morphological analysis where a single presynaptic interneuron was labeled in the slice. The distribution analysis of the synapses was performed with the Neurolucida Explorer software. Values were corrected for shrinkage and flattening of the tissue (x and y axis: no correction, z axis: 1.7). Three PVBC-PN and four CCKBC-PN pairs were further processed for correlated light and electron microscopic studies to confirm the presence of synaptic contacts. Biocytin in BCs was visualized using avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex reaction (ABC; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) with nickel-intensi\ufb01ed 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB-Ni) giving a dark brown reaction product. Alexa 488 in PNs was revealed with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody, with ABC reaction visualized by (3,3-diaminobenzidine) DAB producing a brown end-product. Sections were then postfixed in 0.5% OsO<sub>4</sub> with 7% glucose, treated in 10% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in epoxy resin (Durcupan; Sigma). Ultrathin sections of 60 nm thickness were cut, and contact sites, where the presynaptic axon made close appositions with the identified PN or with randomly sampled targets, were analyzed in serial sections."

Briefly, it has been shown that the 2.1 type potassium channel (Kv2.1) immunostaining delineates the soma and proximal dendrites of the neurons. We found that the length of the proximal dendrites belonging to the perisomatic region shows high variability, but it can be predicted by the diameter of the dendrites at their somatic origin (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a> in <a href=\"#bib58\">Vereczki et al., 2016</a>). Thus, dendrites with a large basal diameter possess a longer proximal dendritic segment belonging functionally to the perisomatic region. Using the correlation between the dendrite diameter at its somatic origin and perisomatic region length, in our analysis for the innervation pattern of BCs recorded in the pairs we could determine if a dendritic contact arrived to the segment belonging to the perisomatic region or not by measuring the basal diameter of the host dendrite."

A comprehensive approach encompassing paired electrophysiological recordings, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy yields convincing results that together support the surprising conclusion that the rules of CCK/PV connectivity to principal cells are quite distinct in amygdala compared to what is known from extensive studies in hippocampus. In particular, CCK and PV interneurons have similar functional impact onto pyramidal neurons in that they each make numerous contacts with somata, where they strongly influence spiking, as opposed to hippocampus where CCK cells have a more prominent dendrite inhibiting role."

This analysis showed that postsynaptic cells receiving different levels of inhibitory control from both basket cell types are distributed in a salt-and-pepper like manner in the BA. There are no privileged areas where the number of perisomatic inhibitory contacts established by single interneurons is higher or lower, therefore, we concluded that the location of PNs is not a determinant factor of the inhibitory control.

[\u2026] Although a similar study has not been conducted for PVBCs, the heterogeneity of the innervation pattern observed in the present work may not be primarily defined by the subtypes of PNs projecting to different regions, a hypothesis that need to be addressed in future investigations.\u201d"
