The main adverse effect of primaquine is erythrocyte age and dose-dependent acute haemolytic anaemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd). As testing for G6PDd is often unavailable, this limits the use of primaquine for radical cure. A compartmental model of the dynamics of red blood cell production and destruction was designed to characterise primaquine-induced haemolysis using a holistic Bayesian analysis of all published data and was used to predict a safer alternative to the currently recommended once weekly 0.75 mg/kg regimen for G6PDd. The model suggests that a step-wise increase in daily administered primaquine dose would be relatively safe in G6PDd. If this is confirmed, then were this regimen to be recommended for radical cure patients would not require testing for G6PDd in areas where G6PDd Viangchan or milder variants are prevalent."

The main adverse effect of primaquine is erythrocyte age and dose-dependent acute haemolytic anaemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd). As testing for G6PDd is often unavailable, this limits the use of primaquine for radical cure. A compartmental model of the dynamics of red blood cell production and destruction was designed to characterise primaquine-induced haemolysis using a holistic Bayesian analysis of all published data and was used to predict a safer alternative to the currently recommended once weekly 0.75 mg/kg regimen for G6PDd. The model suggests that a step-wise increase in daily administered primaquine dose would be relatively safe in G6PDd. If this is confirmed, then were this regimen to be recommended for radical cure patients would not require testing for G6PDd in areas where G6PDd Viangchan or milder variants are prevalent."

The control and elimination of vivax malaria require both cure of the blood stage infection (the stage that causes acute illness) and the prevention of later relapses which derive from dormant hypnozoites in the liver (radical cure). Hypnozoites are formed from sporozoites, which do not develop immediately following mosquito inoculation but instead remain dormant in hepatocytes for weeks or months before developing and causing recurrent blood stage infections called relapses. In general, <i>P. vivax</i> infections in tropical regions are associated with frequent relapses (with intervals as short as three weeks) whilst relapses in <i>P. vivax</i> infections from Central America, Northern India and temperate regions are associated with longer intervals from acute infection to first relapse (<a href=\"#bib29\">White, 2011</a>)."

As G6PDd has sex-linked inheritance, males are either deficient (hemizygotes) or normal, whereas women can be deficient (homozygotes), normal or partially deficient (heterozygotes) in proportions determined by the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Because of Lyonisation, there is substantial variability in the proportion of red cells which are deficient in individual heterozygote females (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beutler et al., 1962</a>)."

For G6PD normal patients, the primaquine regimen for radical cure that is recommended in SE Asia and Oceania (where relapse rates are high) is 0.5 mg base/kg/day for 14 days. Elsewhere it is 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. For patients with G6PDd, a weekly dose is recommended; 0.75 mg/kg/week given for a total of 8 doses. Unfortunately G6PDd testing is not widely available despite the recent introduction of point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for G6PDd. These RDTs are currently too expensive to deploy on a wide scale and can be difficult to interpret, and thus are not generally available (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brito et al., 2016-08</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Satyagraha et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Oo et al., 2016</a>).

Red blood cells (RBCs) transport oxygen which is reversibly bound to the main red cell protein, haemoglobin. RBC production in the bone marrow is regulated to maintain oxygen carrying capacity. When the haemoglobin concentration in the\u00a0blood falls, this reduces oxygen carriage and RBC production is up-regulated, a process mediated largely by the renal hormone, erythropoietin. At times of increased bone marrow production, reticulocytes appear in increased numbers in the circulation (the upper limit of normal is <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mi></mi><mo>\u2248</mo><mrow><mn>1.5</mn><mo lspace=\"0pt\" rspace=\"3.5pt\">%</mo></mrow></mrow></math>). Normal RBCs in healthy people have a very stable life expectancy of around 120 days. This is well modelled by a Gumbel distribution with low variance. In nucleated cells G6PD can be newly synthesised, but the\u00a0red cells lose their nucleus before leaving the bone marrow so very young red cells (reticulocytes) have the highest G6PD activity, and this declines as the RBCs age. In most G6PDd variants, the mutant enzyme degrades more rapidly compared to the normal enzyme. Older erythrocytes may have up to five times less G6PD activity than reticulocytes. G6PDd results in lowered NADPH and a reduced ability to regenerate reduced glutathione. Reduced glutathione protects normal RBCs against oxidant stresses such as the haemolytic effects of primaquine metabolites and certain foods, classically fava beans. G6PD is also important for the function of catalase, another oxidant defence mechanism. As these non-reusable oxidant defence reserves are \u2018used up\u2019, the aging erythrocyte becomes increasingly vulnerable to oxidant haemolysis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beutler et al., 1954a</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib13\">Dern et al., 1954</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Beutler, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Recht et al., 2014</a>)."

However, higher primaquine doses do cause further haemolysis. This explains the fall then rise in haemoglobin with continued daily primaquine administration in mild and moderate severity variants of G6PDd. This temporary primaquine insensitivity in G6PDd individuals with the\u00a0continued primaquine administration was characterised by Beutler and colleagues in a series of studies conducted over sixty years ago (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beutler et al., 1954a</a>,<a href=\"#bib4\">1954b</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">1955</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib13\">Dern et al., 1954</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Beutler, 1959</a>) and later exploited by Alving et al. to develop the once weekly regimen in G6PDd\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Alving et al., 1960</a>.)"

This resulted from reactive erythropoiesis (reticulocytosis) that introduced a younger red cell population to the circulation which was essentially \u2018resistant\u2019 to the haemolytic effects of that primaquine dose. Intermittent primaquine administration resulted in progressively smaller cycles of haemolysis followed by reticulocytosis as the red cell population became younger. These results led to a recommendation for a high-dose, once weekly primaquine regimen for radical cure in vivax malaria patients with G6PDd (8 once weekly adult doses of 45 mg) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alving et al., 1960</a>). This regimen was devised based on studies in subjects with the African <math id=\"inf2\"><msup><mi>A</mi><mo>-</mo></msup></math> variant of G6PDd, which is one of the mildest deficiencies. Safety was not formally assessed in more severe deficiencies. A recent trial of this regimen in vivax malaria patients with the more severe Viangchan G6PDd variant from Cambodia showed a greater fall in haemoglobin and a delayed recovery from anaemia in G6PDd compared to G6PD normal patients with one patient requiring a blood transfusion (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kheng et al., 2015</a>).

The ascending dose regimen would allow for a steady adjustment of the age distribution of RBCs by both slow primaquine-induced haemolysis and the resulting increased erythropoiesis. These results only concern ascending dose regimens given over 20 days. There are two reasons for this; first, adherence to long course regimens is likely to be poor, and second, the first relapses emerge from the liver about 14 days after starting treatment so the primaquine regimen has to provide sufficient drug to prevent the\u00a0emergence or eliminate these parasites."

It was calibrated against recent data in Cambodian patients most of whom had the Viangchan G6PDd variant. Thus, the model predictions of the degree of haemolysis and the tolerability and safety profile would be expected to hold for variants with similar or less severe enzyme abnormalities, but it would not necessarily hold for more severe variants such as G6PDd Mediterranean where more clinical research is required."

An adaptive design protocol has been developed to test the simplified regimen (A) in G6PDd Mahidol healthy volunteers. A study in healthy G6PDd volunteers is essential to characterise the haemolytic response. Data from such a study can then be used to determine an optimal regimen which would then be tested for safety, and efficacy (that\u00a0is, radical cure) in vivax malaria patients in a Phase II (that\u00a0is, to define the PK-PD relationship in patients).

Tafenoquine has the great advantage of being administered as a single dose for radical cure due to its long terminal elimination half-life. However, this means it could be dangerous in G6PD deficiency. Whereas the rapidly eliminated primaquine can be stopped if there is significant haemolysis, limiting the haemolytic effect, the haemolytic effect of the slowly eliminated tafenoquine cannot be readily reversed and so haemolysis will continue until all susceptible red cells are destroyed. Combined regimens for G6PDd patients in which primaquine is given initially to induce controlled haemolysis followed by tafenoquine might be possible, and would allow shorter total treatment durations. Data on the Hb response to different doses of tafenoquine would be necessary to calibrate the model."

RBC dynamics are simulated by tracking the age distribution of the red blood cells in hourly blocks. The homeostatic dynamics, which maintain the number of red blood cells or haematocrit at a steady state are straightforward. At steady state, approximately 0.83% of RBCs are replaced each day and 1% of RBCs in the circulation are reticulocytes. Severe acute anaemia has two consequences in the bone marrow. Reticulocytes are released into the circulating blood at an earlier age and with increased erythropoiesis normoblasts may be released into the circulation (reported as nucleated RBCs) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hillman, 1969</a>). Previous iron turnover studies in humans following phlebotomy suggest sigmoid relationships for both of these processes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hillman, 1969</a>)."

A Bayesian hierarchical structure was used for the steady state haemoglobin and the maximum increase in the production of red blood cells. This makes the assumption that each patient in the study is characterized by an individual steady state haemoglobin concentration <math id=\"inf63\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">H</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">b</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2217</mo></mrow></msup></mrow></mstyle></math> and a maximum production capacity <math id=\"inf64\"><msup><mi>\u03c1</mi><mi>max</mi></msup></math> drawn from a population distribution (normal distributions in both cases). Weekly informative priors were used for all parameters and the posterior distribution was estimated using MCMC with a Metropolis-Hastings proposal. Details of prior distributions and histograms of posterior distributions, together with convergence diagnostics and summary statistics are in the Appendix 1, \u2018Structure of hierarchical model and MCMC diagnostics'."

The relationship between these fitted estimates and the data from the study is approximately linear for all patients (G6PDd and G6PD normal). The MCV is a poor marker of anaemia; high values are associated with reticulocytosis, folate and B12 deficiency and low values with iron deficiency, and thalassaemia both of which are very common in tropical areas. A correlation with steady state haematocrit would suggest that the model is indeed estimating the correct quantities. Therefore if the model estimates of the steady state haematocrit are correct, this should in theory correlate well with the baseline MCV and suggest the model is converging to the correct quantities."

The numbers match clinical reality as I perceive it, but someone needs to check how the figures were generated.

The best available estimates from mass drug administration programs in China in the 1970s and returning US military in the 1950s suggest that the Severe Adverse Event (massive hemolysis) rate is about 1:10,000. Could the authors insert these historical studies into their model to determine if this estimated rate matches what the model generates using 22.5 mg daily for 10 days (China) and 15mg daily for 14 days (US military)?
