Embryos carrying a mutation in the FERM (protein <b>4</b>.1/<b>e</b>zrin/<b>r</b>adixin/<b>m</b>oesin) domain-binding motif of Crumbs die due to an overactive actomyosin network associated with disrupted adherens junctions. This phenotype is restricted to the amnioserosa and does not affect other embryonic epithelia. This function of Crumbs requires <i>D</i>Moesin, the Rho1-GTPase, class-I p21-activated kinases and the Arp2/3 complex.
