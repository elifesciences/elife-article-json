We identified &gt;1680 <i>Botrytis</i>-induced WRKY33 binding sites associated with 1576 <i>Arabidopsis</i> genes. Transcriptional profiling defined 318 functional direct target genes at 14 h post inoculation. Comparative analyses revealed that WRKY33 possess dual functionality acting either as a repressor or as an activator in a promoter-context dependent manner. We confirmed known WRKY33 targets involved in hormone signaling and phytoalexin biosynthesis, but also uncovered a novel negative role of abscisic acid (ABA) in resistance towards <i>B. cinerea</i> 2100. The ABA biosynthesis genes <i>NCED3</i> and <i>NCED5</i> were identified as direct targets required for WRKY33-mediated resistance. Loss-of-WRKY33 function resulted in elevated ABA levels and genetic studies confirmed that WRKY33 acts upstream of <i>NCED3/NCED5</i> to negatively regulate ABA biosynthesis. This study provides the first detailed view of the genome-wide contribution of a specific plant transcription factor in modulating the transcriptional network associated with plant immunity."
