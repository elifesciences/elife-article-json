However, it is not known how and why the tendency to move as a group evolved, and the individual benefits conferred by such collective motion remain unclear. Now, in eLife, Andrew Hein, Iain Couzin and colleagues argue that a natural tendency to move in a group helps social individuals outcompete non-social members in the community (<a href=\"#bib3\">Hein et al., 2015</a>). This is because abilities linked to collective motion help social individuals find resource-rich areas quickly."

For example, a school of fish can quickly change its shape, density and direction of motion when being pursued by a predator or when finding somewhere to feed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). One way to explain this collective motion is to make the fairly natural assumption that each individual monitors how close it is to its nearest neighbours and changes its speed and direction when such a neighbour gets too close to avoid collisions. However, if each individual is also attracted to more-distant neighbours, the group becomes capable of moving as a swarm and performing complex manoeuvres in a coordinated way (<a href=\"#bib2\">D\u2019Orsogna et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">Herbert-Read et al., 2011</a>)."

Three parameters in this model were allowed to evolve: interaction range, cruising speed and slow-down rate (<a href=\"#bib3\">Hein et al., 2015</a>). The \u2018interaction range\u2019 defines the furthest distance that an individual can be from one of its neighbours and still sense that neighbour. For short ranges, the interactions between individuals are dominated by reactions to avoid collisions. However, for longer interaction ranges, the attraction to individuals further away starts to play a role; this leads to cohesive groups as individuals are directed towards more crowded areas. \u2018Cruising speed\u2019 refers to how fast each individual travels when searching for resources, while the \u2018slow-down rate\u2019 refers to how quickly it slows down from this speed once it has found resources."

As such, the model describes fairly simple behaviours whereby each individual reacts to neighbours within a certain range and slows down in a resource-rich environment. The model is also set up such that individuals that spend more time in resource-rich patches produce more offspring; this allows more efficient foragers to outcompete the less efficient ones and take over the population."

Specifically, the interaction range evolves to be long enough to keep dense groups cohesive, while the cruising speed and the slow-down rate evolve to make exploration fast and efficient. Together the values of these three parameters evolve to enable a group foraging strategy. First, separate individuals scout the space until they encounter a resource-rich patch. This causes the individuals to slow down and stay longer inside the patch. Next, passing individuals sense this denser-than-average gathering of slow-moving individuals and are attracted to it. This allows the passing individuals to find patches of resources that they otherwise may have missed. Finally, once the patch is depleted, the group disperses back to scouting the wider environment."

They also show that such a strategy would be resistant to random mutations. This is because individuals who ignore their neighbours will tend to lose out to social individuals who are attracted to a feeding community without actually having to sense the resources themselves. Social individuals will thus spend less time than non-social individuals searching for resource-rich patches. Moreover, Hein at al. suggest that the evolved state is capable of more than collective resource sensing; that is, it can also perform \u2018collective computation\u2019. Indeed, as with the components of a computer, a group of individuals following simple rules can show complex sensing and decision-making properties that they are not capable of alone (so-called emergent properties)."
