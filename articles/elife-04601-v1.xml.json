The most common membrane constriction system in prokaryotes is based on the tubulin homologue FtsZ, whose filaments in <i>E. coli</i> are anchored to the membrane by FtsA and enable formation of the Z ring and divisome. The precise architecture of the FtsZ ring has remained enigmatic. Here, we report three-dimensional arrangements of FtsZ and FtsA filaments in <i>C. crescentus</i> and <i>E. coli</i> cells and inside constricting liposomes by means of electron cryomicroscopy and cryotomography. In vivo and in vitro, the Z-ring is composed of a small, single-layered band of filaments parallel to the membrane, creating a continuous ring through lateral filament contacts. Visualisation of the in vitro reconstituted constrictions as well as a complete tracing of the helical paths of the filaments with a molecular model favour a mechanism of FtsZ-based membrane constriction that is likely to be accompanied by filament siding."
