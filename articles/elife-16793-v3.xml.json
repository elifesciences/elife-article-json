We investigated this relationship in <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>, a model organism capable of regenerating any and all of its adult tissues. Microbiome characterization revealed a high Bacteroidetes to Proteobacteria ratio in healthy animals. Perturbations eliciting an expansion of Proteobacteria coincided with ectopic lesions and tissue degeneration. The culture of these bacteria yielded a strain of Pseudomonas capable of inducing progressive tissue degeneration. RNAi screening uncovered a TAK1 innate immune signaling module underlying compromised tissue homeostasis and regeneration during infection. TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling mediated opposing regulation of apoptosis during infection versus normal tissue regeneration. Given the complex role of inflammation in either hindering or supporting reparative wound healing and regeneration, this invertebrate model provides a basis for dissecting the duality of evolutionarily conserved inflammatory signaling in complex, multi-organ adult tissue regeneration."

We investigated this relationship in <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>, a model organism capable of regenerating any and all of its adult tissues. Microbiome characterization revealed a high Bacteroidetes to Proteobacteria ratio in healthy animals. Perturbations eliciting an expansion of Proteobacteria coincided with ectopic lesions and tissue degeneration. The culture of these bacteria yielded a strain of Pseudomonas capable of inducing progressive tissue degeneration. RNAi screening uncovered a TAK1 innate immune signaling module underlying compromised tissue homeostasis and regeneration during infection. TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling mediated opposing regulation of apoptosis during infection versus normal tissue regeneration. Given the complex role of inflammation in either hindering or supporting reparative wound healing and regeneration, this invertebrate model provides a basis for dissecting the duality of evolutionarily conserved inflammatory signaling in complex, multi-organ adult tissue regeneration."

The results reveal that the two main types of bacteria that are present in planaria are also found in humans. In fact, conditions that encourage the growth and spread of one of these types of bacteria (called Proteobacteria, many of which can make humans ill) damaged the worms and prevented them from regenerating."

Reducing the activity levels of these genes enabled worms that had been infected with Proteobacteria to regenerate again. However, these genes only seem to be responsible for regeneration when the planaria are infected with bacteria. Thus, planaria could be used as a simple model to discover how changes in resident bacteria can be detected by the immune system and affect the ability to regenerate tissues."

Microbial dysbiosis, for example, underlies persistent inflammatory disorders, chronic non-healing wounds, and scar formation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dowd et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Price et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carvalho et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Scales and Huffnagle, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brothers et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Shin et al., 2015</a>). Long-term management of these conditions constitutes a substantial and sharply rising burden on our healthcare system (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sen et al., 2009</a>). Significant evidence spanning a diverse array of organisms and tissues indicates that the immune response can play a central role in either promoting or hindering wound healing and tissue regeneration (<a href=\"#bib20\">Eming et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Karin and Clevers, 2016</a>). The precise determinants facilitating these diametrically opposed outcomes is an area of intense investigation. As such the development of diverse and robust model systems capable of elucidating basic molecular mechanisms governing the interplay of the immune response and tissue regeneration should provide new insights for the design of novel therapies to combat this rising medical issue (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sen et al., 2009</a>)."

These free living members of the phylum Platyhelminthes contain a persistent pool of adult pluripotent stem cells, termed neoblasts, capable of regenerating all of the tissues and cell types of the organism (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wagner et al., 2011</a>). Ablation of this population of mitotic cells via irradiation eliminates regenerative capabilities, resulting in regression of anterior structures and eventual tissue lysis (<a href=\"#bib55\">Reddien et al., 2005</a>). Development of RNAi methodologies has enabled the interrogation of genes involved regeneration (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sanchez Alvarado and Newmark, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Reddien et al., 2005</a>). These studies have informed our understanding of how wound responses, the recognition of lost tissues, dynamic establishment of positional identity, and activation of appropriate stem cell and differentiation programs all serve to accomplish large-scale complex tissue regeneration (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wenemoser et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Scimone et al., 2014</a>). While wounding is the stimulus for regeneration across all organisms studied to date, its incidence also presents an additional challenge. Disruption of barrier epithelia and exposure of mucosal surfaces poses an increased risk for bacterial invasion of internal tissues. Yet the role to which, if any, changes in endogenous microbiota or the planarian immune response have in regeneration is entirely unknown."

Previous studies in planaria have uncovered components of the immune system conserved in humans, but absent from the well-studied innate immunity models of ecdysozoa (<i>e.g.</i>, flies and nematodes) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abnave et al., 2014</a>). This indicates that planaria can serve as a complement to previously established invertebrate models to inform our understanding of the human immune response. While their potent regenerative capabilities and robust capacity for pathogen clearance render them quite resilient, planaria are not invincible. Planaria reared using traditional static culture methods can exhibit features of declining health including decreased appetite, loss of motility, dorsal tissue lesions, tissue degeneration, and lysis. Many of these symptoms can be temporarily alleviated and managed with antibiotics, suggesting that endogenous bacteria can play an antagonistic role in normal regenerative and tissue homeostatic functions. To date much of the planarian immune system and its potential integration with tissue regenerative processes are still a mystery. Importantly, the composition of the planarian microbiome is still unresolved and no direct link between microbiota, the immune system, and tissue regeneration has been established."

We performed deep sequencing of bacterial 16\u00a0s rDNA under various perturbations to elucidate the composition and dynamics of the planarian microbiome. Importantly, we found that transitions in culture conditions or tissue amputation elicited a robust Proteobacteria expansion that coincided with an increase in the susceptibility of intact worms to develop ectopic tissue lesions. Isolation and identification of bacteria that expanded during this time yielded a strain of <i>Pseudomonas</i> capable of inducing progressive tissue degeneration that resulted in either total lysis or resolved to permit regeneration of lost structures. The development of novel low septic culture methods facilitated a candidate RNAi screen examining the mediators of this pathological progression in planaria. We successfully identified a conserved TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling module that both mediated infection-induced tissue degeneration and specifically impeded regeneration during infection. In situ phospho-signaling analyses permitted us to identify tissue and cell types that activate p38 signaling in response to infection, revealing a role in the initiation of localized apoptosis preceding tissue degeneration. This apoptotic and tissue degeneration response coincided with an immune response mediated by <i>jun D</i>, an AP-1 family homolog downstream of TAK1 signaling. Finally, while TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling facilitates apoptosis during infection, it plays a contrasting role in the inhibition of apoptosis during normal regeneration. Altogether, our study uncovered potential mechanisms by which immunity and regeneration intersect to mediate distinct tissue regeneration outcomes, and introduces planarians as the first animal model linking the expansion of endogenous Proteobacteria to inhibition of complex tissue regeneration via the activation of distinct TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling."

In brief, this system enables the constant recirculation and UV sanitization of planarian water to mitigate pathogenic levels of bacteria (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The result is a permissive context for rearing large biomass levels of healthy, fissioning, lesion-free planarians. Adoption of this culture system offered a unique opportunity to study the heretofore unknown composition and dynamics of the planarian microbiome. We hypothesized that bacteria tightly associated with the physiology of healthy worms would be preserved within this recirculation culture while additional, potentially harmful species may accumulate upon exit to traditional static culture conditions. Previously, declining worm health within the\u00a0static culture was remedied by administration of antibiotic. We assayed parallel cohorts of worms transitioned from recirculation to static culture with or without the antibiotic gentamycin for characterization of the composition and dynamics of the planarian microbiome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

The extent to which this process impacts the resident microbiome is heretofore unknown. We transferred worms from recirculating into static culture conditions and amputated the animals above and below the pharynx 3 days later. To mitigate bacterial bloom after exit from recirculation culture, worms were starved for 2 weeks prior to transfer and cultured at low density with frequent water changes. Amputated head, trunk, and tail fragments were separated and 16\u00a0s sequences were analyzed at 0dpa, 3dpa, 7dpa, and 14dpa. Un-amputated worms were analyzed in parallel as a control (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Prolonged starvation and additional water changes successfully mitigated the Proteobacteria bloom, with Bacteroidetes comprising 75 to 81% of the bacterial phyla of intact worms and freshly amputated worm fragments on day 0. Three days after amputation, worms exhibited a reciprocal decrease of Bacteroidetes and amplification of Proteobacteria phyla (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In contrast, un-amputated worms cultured in parallel maintained a relative abundance of Bacteroidetes until the final 2-week time point. This eventual shift is likely the result of prolonged static culture conditions. Next, we analyzed proportional changes in the top genera of intact and regenerating worms. The genera <i>Candidatus Amoebophilus</i> and <i>Segetibacter</i>, both members of the phylum Bacteroidetes, decreased in abundance 3 days after amputation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). In parallel, the genera <i>Acidovorax, Chryseobacterium, Pseudomonas, Vogesella</i>, and <i>Oxalobacter</i> exhibited transient or sustained increases in regenerating worm fragments 3 to 7 days after amputation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G,H</a>). Thus, the expansion of Proteobacteria observed in both regeneration and static culture time courses can be traced to common genera amplified under both conditions."

Negative controls were performed in tandem during sample and library preparation to exclude contamination from resident lab strains. We succeeded in amplifying and sequencing 16\u00a0s libraries from 5 out of 8 worms covering 2 collection sites (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Phyla composition varied between individual animals. Proteobacteria was either the most abundant (3 out of 5 worms) or the second most abundant (2 out of 5 worms) phyla across all worm samples (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the two cases in which Proteobacteria was not the most abundant. These differences in phyla composition were also reflected in the most abundant bacterial genera across individuals. The genera in the highest proportion was <i>Rhodoferax, Lactococcus, Plesiomonas, Giesbergeria</i>, and <i>Candidatus amoebophilus</i> in worms 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This level of variation in endogenous bacterial composition amongst individuals is consistent with previous observations in other animals (<a href=\"#bib12\">Caporaso et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wong et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, the phylum Proteobacteria was proportionally higher in wild collected versus\u00a0lab-raised\u00a0worms consistent with observations flies (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wong et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, we found that the genera that increased during transitions in culture conditions and regeneration, (<i>Chryseobacterium, Vogesella</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas</i>), were detectable in wild planaria samples but present at relatively low levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1J</a>)."

                                "text": "Despite this heterogeneity in bacterial composition, more bacterial genera were common across all four worms collected from site#1 in Sardinia than were unique to any individual (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1K</a>). Furthermore, greater than 90% of the bacterial genera detected among all of our CIW4 lab strain planaria samples were also detected among our wild worm samples (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1L</a>). With respect to wild worms, this level of overlap was ~46%, suggesting that a significant proportion of bacterial genera is distinct in our wild sexual samples. To determine possible differences between asexual versus sexual biotypes, we sampled prominent culturable bacteria from lab raised sexual planaria. We utilized sexual S2F2 genome strain planaria from a fill and drain culture system that were transitioned to traditional static culture. We detected abundant <i>Vogesella, Pseudomonas, Aminobacter</i>, and <i>Hafnia</i> bacterial colonies from sexual worms at day 3 of static culture (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1M</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). This limited sampling demonstrates that asexual and sexual lab cultured planaria have both similar and distinct bacterial composition. Therefore, with respect to wild sexual bacteria, it is unclear to what extent the observed differences with asexual lab planaria are attributable to (1) intrinsic microbiome differences between the asexual and sexual biotypes, (2) region-specific bacterial genera, and/or (3) shifts in genera during lab culture. Importantly, our analyses demonstrate that the vast majority of genera from CIW4 lab strain planaria are common to those of wild type sexual worms."

Removal of animals from the recirculation culture system elicited a 17-fold expansion in 16\u00a0s rDNA over three days that was largely mitigated by gentamycin treatment (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1N</a>). Additionally, both removal from the recirculation culture system and amputation elicited a 2- to 3-log fold increase in score-able bacterial species per worm within 3 days (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1O,P</a>). Representative colony 16\u00a0srDNA amplification and sequencing revealed that the observed bacterial bloom was dominated by three bacterial species belonging to the following genera: <i>Vogesella, Chryseobacterium</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The expansion of these bacteria during culture transition was highly reproducible in multiple withdrawals from two independent recirculation culture systems (data not shown). These findings are consistent with our 16\u00a0s rDNA sequencing data showing proportional increases of these genera within worms upon exit from recirculation culture (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Thus, shifts in microbial composition are coincident with a robust expansion in both absolute bacterial levels and particular bacterial species."

Worms were infected at a concentration of 1E8 CFU/ml and washed every 3\u20134 days for administration of fresh planaria water containing bacteria. This method of infection lead to a dose dependent increase in endogenous bacterial levels over time (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) similar to those observed in the worms following removal from the recirculation system (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

This transition results in an increase in absolute bacterial levels characterized by a relative decrease in the phyla Bacteroidetes, a proportional increase in the phyla Proteobacteria, and the emergence of newly dominant bacterial genera and species (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B,C</a>,<a href=\"#fig2\">2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1N,O</a>). Clustering of the 1,218 genes significantly altered relative to static culture at day 0 revealed transcriptional patterns that were either dependent (clusters 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8,and 9) or independent (clusters 3 and 6) of antibiotic treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Gene clusters sensitive to antibiotic treatment could be divided based on up-regulation (clusters 1, 4, 8, 9) or down-regulation (clusters 2, 5, 7), and then further subdivided into phases of early (clusters 4 and 7), mid (cluster 8), late (clusters 1 and 5), or sustained (clusters 2 and 9) expression changes. Of particular interest was cluster 1, consisting of genes upregulated gradually after exit from the recirculation system in the absence of antibiotic (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This cluster had clear potential enrichment in genes that correlated with increased bacterial levels over time. Interestingly, this gene cohort contained two transcripts with homology to peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pgrps), upstream receptors of the IMD pathway in <i>D. melanogaster.</i> Along with Toll signaling, the IMD pathway represents a conserved branch of the innate immune system with analogous architecture to the inflammatory signaling pathways in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib48\">Panayidou and Apidianakis, 2013</a>). RT/qPCR and WISH analysis confirmed that <i>Pseudomonas</i> infection significantly induced one of these homologous receptors, that we designated <i>pgrp-4</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013G</a>). These data suggest that conserved components of the innate immune and inflammatory signaling pathways may dynamically respond to shifts in the\u00a0microbial composition in planaria. This data as well as the established role of this pathway in immunity and apoptosis lead us to take a candidate based investigation of the role of inflammatory signaling pathways in altered tissue homeostasis and regeneration during infection."

By taking the average score of the worms on each day and converting that average to a color-based scale from blue to red to denote pathological severity, we were able to reduce the complexity of the data to facilitate its visualization. For each RNAi condition, color-coded average scores for each day were stacked along the y-axis in ascending order from top to bottom forming a column. Individual RNAi columns were sorted in ascending order from left to right along the x-axis by their average column scores. The result was a heatmap that ranked the pathological progression of the worms following RNAi treatment in order of increasing overall severity over time. Simply stated, genes in which RNAi treatment reduces pathological progression (presumptive activators) reside left of the control, while genes in which RNAi treatment enhances pathological progression (presumptive inhibitors) reside right of the control."

We mapped the percentage of worms that remained lesion free (stage 0), exhibited head regression (stage 3), fully lysed (stage 5), or regenerated their heads (stage 2.5) onto our average pathological score heatmap (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013F</a>). Control worms remained lesion free for up to 12 days after infection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). RNAi of activators could extend this period up to 20 days. Conversely, RNAi of inhibitors reduced this lesion free period to 6 days. With respect to head regression (stage 3), RNAi of activators largely delayed the initiation of and the extended the duration of this stage while RNAi of inhibitors expedited and contracted it (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Following head regression, control worms began undergoing lysis by day 12, and 100% of worms lysed 27 days following infection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). RNAi of activators delayed and reduced the incidence of lysis and 100% of\u00a0<i>mkk6-1</i> and <i>mkk4</i> RNAi worms survived the entire 30-day duration of our assay. RNAi of inhibitors induced lysis as early as day 4 with no worms surviving after 9 to 23 days. While the vast majority of worms eventually lysed with the administered dosage of 2e8 CFU/ml <i>Pseudomonas</i>, a rare fraction of control worms regenerated their heads by day 23 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). While RNAi of many activators increased the incidence, frequency, and duration of head regeneration and subsequent survival during infection, we observed no incidence of head regeneration following RNAi of the inhibitors <i>pp6, ppm1b, cyld-1</i> or <i>traf2-1</i>. Amongst activators, <i>mkk4</i> and <i>mkk6</i> RNAi worms had the highest incidence of head regeneration while <i>p38-1</i> RNAi had the lowest despite having a\u00a0comparable frequency and timing of the initiation of head regression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In summation, our RNAi screen has identified genes that play a role in mediating tissue degeneration in response to infection and reveal distinct effects on the timing and duration of individual stages of pathological progression."

To order these components we performed combinatorial RNAi experiments and assayed the resulting effects on anterior tissue degeneration. The dsRNA concentration of the inhibitors was reduced by 50% and balanced with a 50% increase in the concentration of activators. This allowed us to determine whether simultaneous knock down of activator genes was sufficient to overcome the sensitized tissue degeneration phenotype from partial knockdown of inhibitors. Worms were analyzed at a tissue degeneration 'tipping point' at which point the following occurred: infected control worms developed anterior lesions (stage 2, Mild), RNAi of single activators resulted in posterior or no lesions (stage 0\u20131, None), and RNAi of single inhibitors produced head regression and/or lysis (stage 3\u20135, Severe) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

Introduction of activator dsRNA in combination with inhibitor dsRNA yielded clear and largely binary shifts in pathologic bacterial responses. Addition of either <i>mkk6-1, p38-1, tak1</i>, and <i>jnk</i> dsRNA rescued head regression and lysis observed in worms following RNAi of <i>pp6</i> alone.

Additionally, our analysis placed <i>cyld-1</i> further downstream in the tissue degeneration process relative to its role in signaling in <i>H. sapiens</i>. The homologous deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD regulates ubiquitin mediated signaling and proteolysis. It is possible that its position within this Phenotype Hierarchy reflects a role in deubiquitination of proteins targeted for proteosomal degradation that are downstream of <i>jnk</i> rather than or in addition to targeting the homolog of the ubiquitin dependent kinase TAK1 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Reiley et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Xue et al., 2007</a>)."

We examined the effects of RNAi knockdown of <i>mkk6-1, mkk4, p38-1, jun D, tak-1, jnk</i>, and <i>pp6</i> on regeneration in the presence or absence of infection (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

RNAi treated worms were infected with <i>Pseudomonas</i> for 2 days and then amputated above and below the pharynx to generate head, trunk, and tail fragments. Resulting phenotypic tissue regeneration was recorded 2 weeks later in comparison to uninfected worms for control and RNAi treated worms (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

Overall, RNAi of the activators largely prevented infection-associated defects in regeneration while RNAi of the inhibitor <i>pp6</i> exacerbated them (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Following infection, 100% of regenerating head fragments in control worms lysed while RNAi of <i>mkk6-1, p38-1</i>, and <i>jnk</i> not only prevented tissue lysis but re-established normal regeneration for 80% of the fragments. Similarly, RNAi of <i>mkk4, tak1</i>, and <i>jun D</i> reduced infection-associated defects in head fragment regeneration observed in controls. RNAi of <i>p38-1</i> or <i>tak-1</i> prevented infection-associated regenerative defects in tail fragments while <i>mkk6-1</i> or <i>jun D</i> RNAi reduced them. Regenerating trunk fragments were relatively resistant to the effects of the infection and RNAi of activators could largely reverse the minor defects observed in controls. Consistent with its role as an inhibitor of TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling, RNAi of <i>pp6</i> exacerbated infection-associated defects resulting in lysis of 100%, 60%, and 100% of regenerating head, trunk, and tail fragments, respectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). These results demonstrate that conserved TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling components also play a pivotal role in determining regenerative outcomes induced by amputation during infection in a manner consistent with the positional sensitivity of these regenerating fragments along the A/P axis."

The most prominent expression pattern was evident in the planarian gut which was shared in both ordered activators (<i>tak1, jnk, jun D, mkk6-1</i>, and <i>p38-1</i>) and inhibitors (<i>pp6, ppm1b</i>, and <i>cyld-1</i>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Weaker staining was also visible in the mesenchymal space between the gut and the epidermis with a slight anterior enrichment (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). While mRNA analysis is useful in identifying structures competent to respond to stimulation, it fails to resolve those cells or tissues dynamically responsive to infection. Fortunately, the phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction of the TAK1/MKK/p38 pathway presented an opportunity to analyze dynamic activation via phospho-antibody based detection of the downstream target, p38. The human homolog of the kinase p38 is activated via phosphorylation at Thr180 and Tyr182, a region highly conserved in planaria (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Han et al., 1994</a>). We tested one polyclonal and one monoclonal phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody for reactivity against the planarian phospho-epitope. UV treatment is a common inducer of P-p38 and western blot analysis revealed both tested antibodies reacted to an induced band at 45kDa corresponding to the size of planarian p38 (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In situ antibody staining revealed that both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies recognized discrete cells above the pharynx (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Initially tested bleaching treatments that were conducive to WISH protocols yielded high background fluorescence in the epidermis precluding analysis of reactivity in this peripheral tissue at this point (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Treatment with UV irradiation induced a broad antibody staining pattern throughout the gut, mirroring the localized expression of the <i>p38-1</i> transcript (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

As previously indicated, initial P-p38 staining experiments utilizing bleaching methods conducive to WISH elicited background staining in peripheral tissues (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>).

A lower frequency of P-p38<sup>+</sup> cells was observed in the posterior region with little to no signal in the mid body region. This signal represents the earliest observed P-p38 activation in response to infection in a pattern that overlaps with and precedes the occurrence of anterior lesions and eventual head regression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

We analyzed the effects of RNAi of both activators and inhibitors of the TAK1/MKK/p38 pathway on amputated tail fragments in the absence of infection. We observed no effects of RNAi of any TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling component on the proliferative burst following amputation (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). To our surprise, amputation induced apoptosis was increased by RNAi of <i>tak1</i> or <i>p38-1,</i> and decreased by RNAi of <i>cyld-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G\u2013J</a>). This stands in direct contrast to the observed effects of ectopic activation of this pathway in enhancing infection-induced apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D,F</a>). Interestingly, <i>tak1</i> and <i>p38-1</i> rnai worms all exhibited phenotypically normal regeneration in the absence of infection (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), suggesting that the observed enhancement in apoptosis is relatively innocuous during normal regeneration. Overall, our data indicate that TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling has dual contrasting roles in the control of apoptosis during either infection or regeneration."

Sequencing of the planarian microbiome revealed a high Bacteroidetes to Proteobacteria ratio in healthy animals. Perturbation such as tissue amputation or changes in culture conditions resulted in a reciprocal contraction of the Bacteroidetes and an expansion of the Proteobacteria populations. Coincident with these microbial shifts, intact worms displayed increased susceptibility to the development of visible tissue homeostatic defects. Isolation of emergent bacteria during this period yielded a strain of <i>Pseudomonas</i> which itself was sufficient to induce tissue degeneration in a morphologically stereotypical progression. Development of novel anti-septic culture methods permitted a candidate RNAi screen focusing on the role of conserved mediators of innate immunity and inflammation in mediating this response to infection. We identified TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling components underlying tissue degeneration and compromised regeneration capacity during infection. Interestingly, while TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling enhanced apoptosis during infection, it repressed apoptosis during tissue regeneration in the absence of infection. Additionally, these tissue degeneration responses were independent of an immune response mediated by <i>jun D</i>, an AP-1 family homolog downstream of TAK1. Taken together, this study demonstrates that Proteobacteria expansion elicits distinct activation of TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling which in turn acts as an impediment to complex tissue regeneration."

This phyla composition is not observed in other invertebrate (<i>e.g., C. elegans</i> and <i>D. melanogaster</i>) or even vertebrate (<i>e.g., D. rerio</i>) model systems that are amenable to large scale genetic screens and have played a pivotal role in shaping our understanding of immunity and host-microbe interactions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Apidianakis and Rahme, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Roeselers et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Novoa and Figueras, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lee and Brey, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ermolaeva and Schumacher, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Berg et al., 2016</a>). An enrichment in Bacteroidetes in <i>S. mediterranea</i> is significant, as this phylum represents a diverse array of key symbionts known to support proper tissue homeostasis, the development of the immune system, as well as the prevention of inflammatory diseases in mammals, and, intriguingly, have even been linked to the early evolution of multicellular organisms (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mazmanian et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Alegado et al., 2012</a>).

Models studying this phenomenon in subsets of genetically-altered or aged individuals have proven instrumental in the analysis of the effects of this expansion, but have been less useful in dissecting factors mediating its causation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carvalho et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Clark et al., 2015</a>).

Maintenance and care of planarians using traditional static methods can yield variable bacterial levels and composition over time, potentially influencing experimental outcomes. Furthermore, prolonged use of antibiotics can lead to the gradual accumulation of resistant pathogenic strains, such as <i>Pseudomonas</i>. Given that many published phenotypes describing gene knockdowns mirror some of the observed effects of bacterial infection (<a href=\"#bib55\">Reddien et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Forsthoefel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Labb\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tu et al., 2012</a>), it will be important to examine the extent to which alterations in endogenous bacteria or stimulation of immune signaling underlie these phenotypes. This issue is particularly relevant to the common practice of feeding worms <i>E. coli</i> producing dsRNA as a means of gene function interrogation. As we have demonstrated, this method of RNAi elicits robust P-p38 activation (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). To mitigate the\u00a0issues of inconsistent bacterial composition and variable immune stimulation across experiments, we have developed an RNAi workflow using recirculation and flow culture systems (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Previous screens examining genes involved in planarian regeneration have utilized either static cultured or <i>E. coli</i> fed worms of indeterminate bacterial content. It would be of interest to employ our novel culture systems to determine whether published phenotypes describing tissue homeostatic defects similar to those observed in this study have inadvertently uncovered genes involved in the interplay between the immune system and regeneration."

In <i>Drosophila</i>, oral infection induces p38-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), damaging gut epithelia, and triggering intestinal stem cell activation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buchon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ha et al., 2009</a>).

One explanation is that the persistence of a population of adult pluripotent stem cells capable of regenerating all missing tissues uniquely endows planaria with a resilience to somatic tissue damage. Planaria may utilize TAK1 innate immune signaling for a coordinate mounting of antibacterial responses while actively clearing infected tissue via apoptosis prior to the initiation of regeneration. Under our sustained infection protocol, pathogen levels were constantly maintained, resulting in failure of complete bacterial clearance and continuous TAK1/MKK/p38 mediated apoptosis. Once this level of tissue turnover outpaces the ability of neoblasts to replace these cells, tissue homeostasis and regeneration capabilities are compromised. Under this context attenuation of infection-induced TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling rescued tissue degeneration and restored regenerative potential."

We took advantage of the amenability of planarians to RNA-mediated genetic interference to identify mediators of <i>Pseudomonas</i>-induced tissue degeneration and its lytic versus regenerative outcomes. We identified a TAK1 innate immunity signaling module underlying tissue degeneration and compromising regeneration capacity during infection. Interestingly, while TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling enhanced apoptosis during infection, it repressed apoptosis during tissue regeneration in the absence of infection. Our data indicate that activation of this pathway has discrete and seemingly opposite roles in host immunity versus normal regeneration. Given the complex role of inflammation in either the hindrance or support of reparative wound healing and regeneration, <i>S. mediterranea</i> provides a basis for dissecting the duality of this evolutionarily conserved inflammatory signaling module in complex, multi-organ adult tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the conservation of bacterial phyla composition and dynamics we uncovered in this invertebrate make it the first non-murine model organism for the study of pathological shifts in endogenous bacteria with relevance to human disease. In summation, our work not only advances planarians as a unique and tractable in vivo model system for the molecular dissection of regeneration, but also opens the door to the identification and characterization of conditions that promote or inhibit the natural execution of regenerative processes."

The planarian recirculation culture system is composed of three culture trays (96' L \u00d7 24' W \u00d7 12' H) stacked vertically on top of each other over a sump. Planarian water flows from the sump pump through a chiller, canister filter, and a UV sterilizer into the top tray. Water subsequently flows down drains at the opposite ends of the source through the series of three trays. Water then re-enters the sump where it is filtered through two vertically stacked 400\u2009\u03bcm and 200\u00a0\u03bcm sieves. Beyond the sieves, water is gravity fed and mechanically filtered through a set of filter/floss pads. Finally, water passes through Water Garden Oasis Pond Matrix and Kaldness media to remove nitrogenous waste.

Arnold and colleagues take advantage of a novel low-septic culturing method they have developed in which planarians are first reared in a circulating water culture system and then transferred to traditional static cultures. This transition results in declining planarian health, triggered by bacterial pathogens, and manifests in easy-to-score tissue lesions, degeneration of tissue, and eventual lysis. The authors perform bacterial 16s rDNA deep sequencing under different culturing conditions to elucidate the composition and dynamics of the planarian microbiome. Interestingly, transition in culture conditions or tissue amputation elicits a reduction of Bacteroidetes and expansion of Proteobacteria (e.g., <i>Pseudomonas</i>) that correlates with susceptibility of worms to develop lesions. The strength of the paper lies in the methodology that Arnold et al. have devised for harnessing the shift in microbiome composition (caused by transitioning worms from circulating, low-septic culture methods to static culture) to identify host transcriptional changes by RNA Sequencing. The authors then use a candidate-based approach as proof of principle to examine conserved immune regulators and identify the TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling module as an important mediator of pathological progression."

However, the epistasis analysis performed by combinatorial RNAi experiments is confounding and certain aspects of the pathway are quite different from what has already been worked out in <i>Drosophila</i> and mammalian models. For example, the authors place planarian <i>cyld-1</i> epistatically downstream of Tak1, whereas in <i>Drosophila</i> and mouse models it acts upstream (CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that physically interacts with Tak1 and regulates its ubiquitination). There is also equivalent evidence for placing Mkk4 upstream of PP6 rather than in parallel to the other genes, just as the other double RNAi outcomes were interpreted as indicative of a linear pathway. An explanation for such discrepancies could be that epistasis analysis using anything other than null alleles can be fraught with difficulties, especially when genes play roles in other developmental processes or if genetic redundancy is involved. Given the pitfalls of performing epistasis analysis by reduced-penetrance RNAi, the authors should either provide additional evidence supporting their divergent pathway or remove these data and the problematic pathway interpretations from the manuscript (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

However, the epistasis analysis performed by combinatorial RNAi experiments is confounding and certain aspects of the pathway are quite different from what has already been worked out in Drosophila and mammalian models. For example, the authors place planarian cyld-1 epistatically downstream of Tak1, whereas in Drosophila and mouse models it acts upstream (CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that physically interacts with Tak1 and regulates its ubiquitination). There is also equivalent evidence for placing Mkk4 upstream of PP6 rather than in parallel to the other genes, just as the other double RNAi outcomes were interpreted as indicative of a linear pathway. An explanation for such discrepancies could be that epistasis analysis using anything other than null alleles can be fraught with difficulties, especially when genes play roles in other developmental processes or if genetic redundancy is involved. Given the pitfalls of performing epistasis analysis by reduced-penetrance RNAi, the authors should either provide additional evidence supporting their divergent pathway or remove these data and the problematic pathway interpretations from the manuscript</i> (<i><a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a></i>)."

Therefore, it is difficult to resolve to what extent the differences relative to other species that we find in our analysis are attributable to distinct organization of this pathway in planaria versus the limitations of RNAi to effectively resolve these relationships. With respect to <i>cyld-1</i>, planaria in fact have four different <i>cyld</i> homologs. Therefore, while <i>cyld-1</i> was placed downstream of <i>tak1</i> and <i>jnk</i>, the position of <i>cyld-2, cyld-3</i>, or <i>cyld-4</i> could be more analogous to their hierarchy in Homo sapiens. Furthermore, in <i>Drosophila</i> CYLD functions in distinct manner relative to Homo sapiens. Rather than deubiquitinating TAK1 to regulate signaling, dCYLD deubiquitinates dTRAF2 to prevent proteolysis (Xue, Igaki, et.al. 2007). Given these differences between the roles of CYLD in Homo sapiens and <i>Drosophila</i>, and the additional CYLD homologues in planaria, we cannot conclude that the placement of <i>cyld-1</i> relative to the other components is inherently flawed. Additionally, we did acknowledge in the manuscript text that mkk4 could be placed either upstream or lateral to the other pathway components but realize this could be further clarified and emphasized in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>."
