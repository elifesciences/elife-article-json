Here, using genome sequencing data for 211 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> accessions taken from across the globe, we identify thousands of recent transposition events involving half of the 326 TE families annotated in this plant species. We further show that the composition and activity of the 'mobilome' vary extensively between accessions in relation to climate and genetic factors. Moreover, TEs insert equally throughout the genome and are rapidly purged by natural selection from gene-rich regions because they frequently affect genes, in multiple ways. Remarkably, loci controlling adaptive responses to the environment are the most frequent transposition targets observed. These findings demonstrate the pervasive, species-wide impact that a rich mobilome can have and the importance of transposition as a recurrent generator of large-effect alleles."

Here, using genome sequencing data for 211 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> accessions taken from across the globe, we identify thousands of recent transposition events involving half of the 326 TE families annotated in this plant species. We further show that the composition and activity of the 'mobilome' vary extensively between accessions in relation to climate and genetic factors. Moreover, TEs insert equally throughout the genome and are rapidly purged by natural selection from gene-rich regions because they frequently affect genes, in multiple ways. Remarkably, loci controlling adaptive responses to the environment are the most frequent transposition targets observed. These findings demonstrate the pervasive, species-wide impact that a rich mobilome can have and the importance of transposition as a recurrent generator of large-effect alleles."

Depending on whether their mobilization relies on a RNA or DNA intermediate, they are classified as retrotransposons (class I) or DNA transposons (class II), respectively (<a href=\"#bib67\">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</a>). TEs are further subdivided into distinct families, the prevalence of which differs between organisms because of a complex array of factors, including variable transposition activity and diverse selection pressures (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barr\u00f3n et al., 2014</a>). Given their mobile nature, TEs pose multiple threats to the physical and functional integrity of genomes. In particular, TEs can disrupt genes through insertion and also through excision in the case of DNA transposons. Thus, TE mobilization is a source of both germline and somatic mutations (<a href=\"#bib60\">Richardson et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barr\u00f3n et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lisch, 2013</a>). Although TEs are endogenous mutagens with potentially catastrophic effects, their mobilization might sometimes be beneficial. In fact, soon after their discovery, Barbara McClintock named TEs 'controlling elements' to emphasize their role in the control of gene action (<a href=\"#bib51\">McClintock, 1956</a>). In mammals, transposition of some <i>LINE 1</i> retrotransposons occurs extensively during embryogenesis as well as in the adult brain, again suggesting functional relevance of somatic TE mobilization (<a href=\"#bib59\">Richardson et al., 2014</a>). Nonetheless, TEs are under tight control to limit their mutational impact both within and across generations. In plants and mammals, a major control is through epigenetic silencing mechanisms, including DNA methylation and these mechanisms can in turn have 'epimutagenic' effects on adjacent genes (<a href=\"#bib67\">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Weigel and Colot, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Heard and Martienssen, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Quadrana and Colot, 2016</a>)."

Thus, a species-wide view of the mobilome - i.e. of the set of TE families with transposition activity - is lacking for most organisms."

In contrast, the number of TE families that have retained transposition activity is much larger in the mouse and these include several so-called endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in addition to <i>LINEs</i> and <i>SINEs</i> (<a href=\"#bib60\">Richardson et al., 2015</a>). In Drosophila, which has a much smaller genome (\u223c120 Mb) characterized by a large repertoire of class I and class II TE families, the situation is again different with most TE families likely mobile (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mackay et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cridland et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Robert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rahman et al., 2015</a>).

Specifically, we show that the <i>A. thaliana</i> mobilome is composed of a very large number of class I and class II TE families overall, but differs extensively among accessions. We further show that TE mobilization is a complex trait and we have identified environmental as well as genetic factors that influence transposition in nature. These factors include the annual temperature range, the TE themselves and multiple gene loci, notably <i>MET2a</i>, which encodes a poorly characterized DNA methyltransferase. In addition, we present compelling evidence that TEs insert throughout the genome with no overt bias and that the mobilome has a pervasive impact on the expression and DNA methylation status of adjacent genes. These and other observations indicate that purifying selection is most probably the main factor responsible for the differential accumulation of TE sequences along the <i>A. thaliana</i> genome and notably their clustering in pericentromeric regions. Finally, we reveal the importance of the mobilome as a generator of large-effect alleles at loci underlying adaptive traits. Collectively, our approaches and findings provide a unique framework for detailed studies of the dynamics and impact of transposition in nature."

First, we looked for TE copy number variation (CNV) between the reference accession Columbia (Col-0) and 211 accessions taken from across the globe. To limit the problem posed by the presence of TEs in multiple copies across the genome, with varying degrees of similarity to each other, we performed an aggregated CNV analysis based on the 11,851 annotated Col-0 TE sequences longer than 300\u00a0bp (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

Crucially, because most TE families generate short target site duplications (TSDs) of fixed size upon insertion, TSDs can serve as signatures of <i>bona fide</i> transposition events. We therefore developed a pipeline for the systematic identification of split-reads covering TE junctions that are absent from the reference genome and that produce, when mapped to the insertion site, a sequence overlap of the size of TSDs (3 to 15 bp, depending on the TE family, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Our pipeline differs in that respect from that used in another study to detect the presence/absence of reference and non-reference TE insertions in the same set of accessions (<a href=\"#bib69\">Stuart et al., 2016</a>). Results produced by our pipeline for the 292 annotated TE families that create TSDs upon transposition were verified visually to eliminate false positives (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Following this approach, non-reference TE insertions with TSDs were identified for 131 TE families in total (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>), which all also show CNV (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Moreover, recent transposition activity is only detected for between four and 66 TE families in any given accession, thus indicating large variations in the composition of the mobilome among accessions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Nonetheless, we have probably identified most of the annotated TE families that compose the mobilome at the species level, because\u00a0the number of TE families defined as mobile by the split-reads approach reaches a plateau after examining just 74 accessions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). The 53 class I <i>COPIA</i> families and the 40 class II Mutator-like (<i>MuDR</i>) families are the most mobile, as they account for 1408 and 729 of the 2835 non-reference TE insertions with TSDs identified in total, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">3</a>). However, the number of non-reference insertions per accession is always small (&lt;16) for any given family (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>), thus suggesting a lack of recent transposition bursts."

To assess the extent of this limitation, we used the assembled Ler-1 genome sequence recently obtained using PacBio long reads (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Although not annotated, this sequence assembly can serve to identify by whole genome comparison the Col-0 TEs flanked by TSDs that are absent from the corresponding position in the\u00a0Ler-1 genome\u00a0(see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). A total of 142 TEs belonging to 80 distinct families were identified in this way (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 4</a>), which is\u00a0consistent with estimates obtained using other approaches (<a href=\"#bib78\">Ziolkowski et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">H\u00e9naff et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, we could detect only 78 Col-0-specific TEs with TSDs belonging to 49 TE families when using the split-reads pipeline to map Col-0 short reads onto the assembled Ler-1 genome. These results indicate therefore that the split-reads approach has a low sensitivity (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>; 45% false negatives and 10% false positives; False Discovery Rate: 15.3%)."

Briefly, probes were designed to cover the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 extremities of 310 TE elements belonging to 181 distinct families, including 117 of the 131 TE families identified as mobile with\u00a0the split-reads approach (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Using genomic DNA extracted from 12 randomly chosen accessions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), we could validate by TE-capture most (87%) of the non-reference TE insertions with TSDs that were detected by the split-reads approach (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). As expected, TE-capture also uncovered many additional non-reference TE insertions with TSDs for the same\u00a0TE families (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>). However, no such insertions were detected for the other TE families that could be captured but which were not identified as mobile by the split-reads approach in any of the 12 accessions. These results confirm that despite the low sensitivity of the latter, we have probably identified most of the TE families with TSDs that compose the <i>A. thaliana</i> mobilome at the species level. Finally, non-reference insertions were also identified for 30 TE families (including 15 <i>HELITRON</i> families) that could not be analyzed using our split-reads pipeline because they do not produce TSDs or have insertion sites located in low complexity regions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Since most of the non-reference insertions for these 30 TE families are present in only one or two of the 12 accessions examined (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>), they likely reflect recent transposition events. Thus, there are altogether at least 165 TE families with recent transposition activity at the species level. Moreover, based on the TE-capture data, we can estimate that since they diverged from each other any two accessions have accumulated between ~200 and ~300 newly transposed TE copies (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2H</a>)."

For 33 TE families, a disproportionately large number of SNPs are associated with CNV, preventing further analysis. For the remaining 80 TE families, SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with each other and associated with CNVs delineate 230 loci. Moreover, 34% of these loci are also identified by GWAS using whole genome sequencing data obtained for another 180 accessions taken from Sweden (<a href=\"#bib47\">Long et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). This substantial overlap suggests a similar genetic architecture for the <i>A. thaliana</i> mobilome at both the local and global scales, which prompted us to perform joined GWASs using all 391 accessions in order to increase both sensitivity and specificity. Depending on the TE family, GWASs identified from 0 to\u00a033 loci and collectively, associations explain between 2% and 67% of the variance in CN (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

Furthermore, each of these local (<i>cis</i>) genetic variants explains on average 5.2% of the total variance compared with 2.2% for distal (<i>trans</i>) genetic variants. The higher explanatory power of <i>cis</i> variants is of course to be expected, as the TEs themselves are the primary determinants of the transposition process. Indeed, almost all <i>cis</i> SNPs that map to TE sequences in the reference genome are likely causal as they affect sequences involved in transposition, for example the long terminal repeats (LTRs) and the various open reading frames of LTR retrotransposons (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B and C</a>)."

Given that class II TEs move by a cut and paste mechanism, some <i>trans</i> loci could in fact correspond to sites of excision. However, we could not find evidence of excision footprints, such as small insertions or deletions. Alternatively, the larger fraction of CN variance explained by <i>trans</i> loci for class II TE families may in part result from many of these families being non-autonomous, i.e. requiring factor(s) encoded by other TEs for their mobilization. Consistent with this possibility, the proportion of CN variance associated with <i>trans</i> loci as well as the number of TE annotations overlapping <i>trans</i> loci are higher for non-autonomous than autonomous class II TE families (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>). Although we did not investigate <i>trans</i> mobilization in depth, we readily identified one probable\u00a0case, involving the non-autonomous and autonomous MuDR families <i>ATDNA1T9A</i> and <i>VANDAL16</i>, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>). Of note, CN do not co-vary between these two families, which could indicate that their transposition is differentially controlled. Finally, 'false' <i>trans</i> loci could also be caused by non-reference TE insertions that are sufficiently frequent to be in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs used for the GWASs but that we have failed to detect. However, such <i>trans</i> loci are not expected to be more prevalent for class II than class I TE families and should be very rare in any case given that the probability of missing moderately frequent (&gt;5%) non-reference TE insertions by both the split-reads approach and TE-capture is low (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3G</a>)."

Overall, these genes do not appear to be enriched for any particular function and most of them are specific to a single TE family (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3H</a>). These observations indicate either a complex genetic architecture of mobilome variation and/or spurious <i>trans</i> associations such as those considered above. Nonetheless, 22 <i>trans</i> loci stand out as they show association with CNV for two or more TE families (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and a causal link is evident in two cases. Indeed, the locus associated with CNV for respectively the retrotransposon and DNA transposon families <i>ATGP2</i> and <i>ATENSPM2</i> encodes the transcription factor ARF23, which recognizes motifs that are overrepresented in the sequence of these TEs. The second locus is associated with CNV for the largest number of TE families (four class I and three class II families, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) and encodes the MET2a protein, a poorly characterized homolog of the main DNA maintenance methyltransferase MET1. Moreover, one of the <i>MET2a</i> SNPs is presumably causal as it leads to a non-synonymous amino-acid substitution (G519E) in a conserved domain of the protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) that in the mammalian homolog Dnmt1 is required for the targeting to replication foci (<a href=\"#bib35\">Klein et al., 2011</a>). A role for <i>MET2a</i> is also supported by the observation that <i>met2a</i> mutant plants (<a href=\"#bib68\">Stroud et al., 2013</a>) lose some DNA methylation exclusively over mobile TE families. Furthermore, loss of methylation is more pronounced when only considering the seven TE families that show a <i>MET2a</i> association (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Intriguingly, CHG sites (where H=A, T or C), which are poor substrates for MET1 or Dnmt1 compared to CG sites (<a href=\"#bib37\">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</a>), are the most affected in the <i>met2a</i> mutant. Whether or not this observation reflects an atypical recognition specificity for MET2a remains to be determined. Finally, we note that GWASs failed to detect any association with genes known to be involved in the epigenetic silencing of TEs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ito and Kakutani, 2014</a>) such as <i>MET1</i> and <i>DDM1</i>, presumably because of their essential function."

Mechanistically, such clustering may result from insertion bias, selective constraints or differential elimination of TE copies through ectopic homologous recombination (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barr\u00f3n et al., 2014</a>). To distinguish between these possibilities, we looked at the genomic location of the 2835 non-reference TE insertions with TSDs detected with the split-reads approach and found that they are distributed almost evenly along chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Since a similar distribution is observed for the non-reference TE insertions with TSDs detected exclusively\u00a0using TE capture (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), we can rule out an ascertainment bias of the split-reads approach towards non-reference TE insertions located along the chromosome arms. However, there is a clear trend towards a more pericentromeric localization when only considering non-reference TE insertions with TSDs that are shared by two or more accessions and that are thus presumably more ancestral (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Moreover, the density of non-reference TE insertions with TSDs positively correlates with the recombination rate but negatively with gene density (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C, D and E</a>). Finally, except for <i>COPIA</i> families, non-reference TE insertions with TSDs are globally under-represented within genes, where they are expected to be most detrimental (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Collectively, these observations provide strong evidence that TEs insert equally throughout the genome and are preferentially purged over time from the chromosome arms because of their deleterious effects on adjacent genes rather than as a consequence of ectopic homologous recombination."

To investigate more directly the impact of TEs on the genes within or near which they insert, we examined RNA-seq data available for 144 accessions (<a href=\"#bib64\">Schmitz et al., 2013</a>). Specifically, we considered all non-reference TE insertions with TSDs and calculated for each gene located within 1\u00a0kb of them (1616 genes in total), the ratio between the expression level in the accession(s) harboring the insertion and the median expression level in the accessions devoid of the insertion. Expression ratios expected under the null hypothesis (no effect of the TE insertions) were calculated by taking 10<sup>6</sup> randomly chosen sets of 1616 genes and assigning for each set the TE insertion \u2018presence/absence\u2019 label randomly among the 144 accessions (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Comparison of the distribution of the observed and expected expression ratios indicates that for a large fraction of genes, expression is indeed significantly altered when TEs insert within or near them (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>,\u00a0p&lt;1.9\u00d710<sup>-5</sup>). These alterations are most pronounced for the <i>COPIA</i> insertions, which are overrepresented in genes and less pronounced for the <i>MuDR</i> insertions, despite the latter being overrepresented around the TSS of genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Although other TE superfamilies show similar trends, we could not draw firm conclusions in these cases because of insufficient statistical power (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This notwithstanding, it is clear that TE insertions induce both increases and decreases in gene expression with equal frequency (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D and E</a>). Thus our findings contradict the prevailing view of a dampening effect of TE insertions on the expression of adjacent genes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</a>) and suggest instead a stronger selection against TE insertions when they occur close to highly expressed genes."

To investigate the effect of new TE insertions on the DNA methylation status of adjacent sequences, we used MethylC-Seq data available for 140 accessions (<a href=\"#bib64\">Schmitz et al., 2013</a>). Analysis of this data set first indicated that mobile TE families have on average higher CG, CHG and CHH methylation than non-mobile TE families (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Furthermore, DNA methylation is also higher for most mobile TE families in the accessions with\u00a0evidence\u00a0of recent transposition activity (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These observations prompted us to examine in addition methylome data obtained for several mutation accumulation (MA) lines (<a href=\"#bib6\">Becker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Schmitz et al., 2011</a>). Mobile TE families suffer less sporadic DNA methylation loss than non-mobile families (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These findings are entirely consistent with DNA methylation playing an important role in the control of TE mobility and they\u00a0suggest in turn that most of the recent TE insertions we have identified are present in the methylated state. Moreover, given that DNA methylation is likely established over newly inserted TE copies by RdDM in a progressive manner across multiple generations (<a href=\"#bib70\">Teixeira et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Mar\u00ed-Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez et al., 2013</a>), unmethylated non-reference TE insertions should be mainly private and reflect very recent transposition events."

Approximately 10% of sites are methylated in most accessions, including systematically in the one(s) containing the TE. As expected, these sites are preferentially located within TE-rich, pericentromeric regions. In contrast, another 40% of sites are devoid of methylation in the accession(s) containing the TE insertion as well as in most of the other accessions. This absence of adjacent DNA methylation could indicate either that the TE insertions themselves are unmethylated or else that DNA methylation does not spread from them. Finally, 50% of sites are methylated exclusively or almost exclusively in the accession(s) with the TE insertion (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), thus suggesting that at these sites TEs are methylated and that DNA methylation did\u00a0spread into adjacent sequences. Why some sites may be refractory to DNA methylation spreading when others are not is unclear, as we did not identify any feature that could distinguish them, such as the identity of the TE or the sequence composition at the insertion site."

For 243 insertion sites however, DNA methylation extends over much longer distances (up to 3.5 kb) on one or the other side of the insertion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and E</a>). While most of these sites lie within or close to genes, the TE insertions are not preferentially orientated with respect to gene transcription (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), which rules out sense-antisense transcription as the likely trigger for this long-distance DNA methylation. Proximity to pericentromeric heterochromatin can also be ruled out, because most of the genes with long-distance DNA methylation are located on the chromosome arms (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). To explore potential mechanisms further, we made used of the wealth of epigenomic data available in Col-0 to examine the 142 Col-0 TE insertions with TSDs that are absent from the assembled Ler-1 genome sequence (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 4</a>). Methylome data (<a href=\"#bib68\">Stroud et al., 2013</a>) indicate that 121 of these 142 Col-0 TE copies are methylated and that DNA methylation tends to extend into flanking sequences, predominantly over short distances, but occasionally over much longer distances (&lt;300\u00a0pb: 63 TE insertions; &gt;1\u00a0kb: 36 TE insertions; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 4</a>). These results confirm those obtained for the non-reference TE insertions. In addition, analysis of Col-0 small RNA-seq data (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fahlgren et al., 2009</a>) indicates that in contrast to short-distance DNA methylation, long-distance DNA methylation aligns with 24-nt siRNAs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Thus, genes affected by the latter type of DNA methylation have presumably become secondary targets of RdDM, as was shown for a transgene (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kanno et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Daxinger et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, genes affected by long-distance DNA methylation in accessions other than Col-0 tend in the\u00a0latter accession, where they are by definition in the ancestral state, to be most highly expressed in both pollen and seeds and more highly expressed in these two organs than genes affected by short-distance DNA\u00a0methylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Given that RdDM activity is also maximal in these organs (<a href=\"#bib71\">Teixeira and Colot, 2010</a>), our observations suggest that secondary RdDM results from the concomitance of strong transcription and strong RdDM at target loci."

These and similar findings reported recently (<a href=\"#bib69\">Stuart et al., 2016</a>) confirm and extend previous results that first indicated that many natural gene C-DMRs are not <i>bona fide</i> epialleles but rather new alleles caused by TE insertions (<a href=\"#bib64\">Schmitz et al., 2013</a>).

Such enrichment could result from insertion preferences or reflect\u00a0an absence of strong negative selection. In fact, three of these 10\u00a0kb windows span genes encoding nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) proteins, which function as immune receptors in plants and are known to be under diversifying selection (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chae et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, a fourth 10\u00a0kb window spans the gene <i>FLC</i>, which encodes a key repressor of flowering and is one of the main genetic factors causing natural variation in the onset of flowering, another key adaptive trait (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ietswaart et al., 2012</a>). Remarkably, the <i>FLC</i> locus has the highest number of non-reference TE insertions (seven in total) across the genome. These insertions belong to several COPIA families and affect four distinct <i>FLC</i> haplotypes in total (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Moreover, five insertions are located within the first intron (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), which plays an important role in the epigenetic regulation of <i>FLC</i> in response to cold (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ietswaart et al., 2012</a>). Although four of these insertions as well as another intronic insertion were previously identified among early flowering accessions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Liu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lempe et al., 2005</a>), causality could not be established unequivocally because of numerous other sequence polymorphisms in complete linkage disequilibrium. To obtain direct proof of a causal role for the seven TE insertions we identified, we used publically available transcriptomic (<a href=\"#bib64\">Schmitz et al., 2013</a>) as well as phenotypic data (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lempe et al., 2005</a>) and compared <i>FLC</i> expression as well as flowering time among accessions that have the same <i>FLC</i> haplotype but differ by the presence or absence of a TE insertion (see \u2018Material and methods\u2019). Results of these comparisons indicate that the TE-containing accessions have systematically much reduced <i>FLC</i> expression and flower much earlier than their TE-free counterparts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). Thus, we can conclude that TEs are recurrent generators of major effect <i>FLC</i> alleles, which in turn suggests that they contribute significantly to the high level of allelic heterogeneity observed at this locus (<a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 2014</a>)"

This finding is at odds with the prevailing view that most TE families are mere molecular fossils in <i>A. thaliana,</i> since they contain a much lower proportion of 'young', i.e. non-degenerated TE copies than in the close relative <i>A. lyrata</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Maumus and Quesneville, 2014</a>). Furthermore, we provide definitive evidence that TEs insert throughout the genome, with no overt bias towards pericentromeric regions, which contrasts with the observed clustering of annotated TE sequences around centromeres. However, these discrepancies are easily resolved, since we have also shown that despite the richness of the <i>A. thaliana</i> mobilome, most TEs tend to be rapidly purged by natural selection in this species when they insert in the chromosome arms, which are gene-rich. Indeed, our systematic survey indicates that TEs have pervasive effects on the expression and DNA methylation status of genes near or within which they insert. Incidentally, the deleterious effects associated with most transposition events in <i>A. thaliana</i> may also explain in part the fact that we did not detect any recent transposition bursts, as these should be strongly counter-selected. Furthermore, because <i>A. thaliana</i> is predominantly self-fertilizing, the purging of deleterious TE insertions should be accelerated in this species compared to <i>A. lyrata</i>, which is an obligated out-crosser. Given this difference in mating systems, the TE population dynamics of <i>A. thaliana</i> and <i>A. lyrata</i> are expected to differ significantly (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lockton and Gaut, 2010</a>). Thus, homologous recombination could play a more prominent role in the elimination of TE insertions in <i>A. lyrata,</i> as is thought to be the case in <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barr\u00f3n et al., 2014</a>). However, comprehensive studies similar to those presented here remain to be performed for <i>A. lyrata</i> in order to identify conclusively the forces that shape the TE landscape in this species."

The fact that we could readily detect such <i>cis</i> variants may again be linked to the mating system of <i>A. thaliana</i>, which on the one hand should increase the probability that disabling mutations accumulate within the few active TE copies that are present within a given lineage, before these copies could transpose further; and on the other hand should decrease the probability of acquiring new active copies through crosses."

While the role of MET2a in transposition control remains to be determined experimentally, it is noteworthy that none of the epigenetic repressors of TE activity identified through genetic screens, such as MET1 or DDM1, are associated with natural variation of the mobilome, presumably because of their essential function. Altogether, these findings illustrate the power of GWASs in identifying the genetic factors affecting transposition in nature."

More generally, our study highlights the need for similar species-wide explorations of the mobilome in a variety of organisms in order to assess the true mutational and epimutational impact of transposition as well as its contribution to natural phenotypic variation. In this respect, it can be anticipated that the advent of long read sequencing technologies will greatly facilitate such studies, especially in organisms with large, repeat-rich genomes."

Briefly, for each accession we retrieved reads that do not map to the TAIR10 reference genome (containing the SAM flag 4), but we did not make use of information about discordant paired-end reads, unlike in the Jitterbug approach (<a href=\"#bib26\">H\u00e9naff et al., 2015</a>). Unmapped reads were then aligned (using Bowtie2 in --local mode to allow for soft clip alignments) to a collection of 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 TE sequence extremities (300\u00a0bp) obtained from the Col-0 for each TE family or from Repbase Update (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jurka et al., 2005</a>) in the case of the <i>ARNOLDY2, ATCOPIA62, ATCOPIA95, TA12, TAG1</i> families, which do not contain copies with intact extremities in the Col-0 genome. Next, we selected all reads with one end (\u226520\u00a0nt) mapping to a TE extremity (by locating reads where the CIGAR string contained only one \u2018S\u2019 character with a value equal or greater to 20).

Read clusters composed of five or more reads clipped from the same extremity and overlapping with read clusters composed of reads clipped from the other extremity were taken to indicate the presence of a bona fide TE insertion only if the size of the overlap was equal or less than two-fold larger than that reported for TSDs for the corresponding TE family. Putative non-reference TE insertions overlapping genomic regions with aberrant coverage (as defined above) or located within inner pericentromeres (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clark et al., 2007</a>) or spanning the corresponding donor TE sequence were filtered out. Presence or absence of these putative non-reference TE insertions was verified in other accessions by relaxing the parameters used to detect them in the first place. Specifically, we asked for the presence of a minimum of two rather than ten soft-clipped reads spanning the corresponding TSD coordinates. This improved the discovery of putative TE-insertions that are shared by more than one accession."

These 181 TE families include 117 of the 131 mobile TE families identified using the split-read approach as well as most other TE families for which non-degenerate and thus potentially mobile copies are present in the Col-0 genome. Mobile or potentially mobile TE families with skewed sequence composition or very high copy number (including all ATHILA families) were excluded from the design in order to avoid overt biases in the capture of TE sequences. Twelve DNA sequence libraries for the accessions Pi-0, Bl-1, Sp-0, Ta-0, Lip-0, Bla-1, Stw-0, Cvi-0, Kondara, Jm-0, Gre-0 and Rubezhnoe-1 were prepared following the Illumina TruSeq paired-end kit, with some modifications. One \u00b5g of genomic DNA was sheared to a median fragment size of 400-450\u00a0bp. Fragments were subjected to end repair, A-tailing and index adapter ligation following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Libraries were then amplified through 7 cycles of ligation-mediated PCR using the KAPA HiFi Hot Start Ready Mix and primers AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGA and CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAG at a final concentration of 2\u00a0\u00b5M. PCR products were cleaned-up using the Qiaquick PCR Purification kit following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, except that DNA was eluted in PCR grade water. Amplified DNA libraries were then pooled and one \u00b5g of the multiplex pool was used in the first hybridization step to capture probes (72\u2009hr). Captured DNA was recovered using Streptavidin Dynabeads, washed and PCR amplified (5 cycles) as above. Amplified captured DNA was then subjected to a second round of hybridization (12\u2009hr), recovery and amplification (14 cycles). Hybridization, captured DNA recovery and washing were performed as described in the NimbleGen SeqCapture EZ protocol. Pre-capture and post-second capture PCR products were run on an Agilent Bioanalyser DNA 1000 chip. Enrichment for capture TE sequences was confirmed by qPCR and estimated at 50\u2013100 fold depending on the TE. Pair-end sequencing was performed with Illumina HiSeq 2000 and 100\u00a0bp reads. Between 10.7 and 16.1 million pairs were sequenced per library. Pairs were mapped to the TAIR10 reference genome using Bowtie2 with the arguments --mp 13 --rdg 8,5 --rfg 8,5 --very-sensitive -X 1000. .

CNs for the 113 families confirmed as mobile by the split-read approach and TE-capture were used to calculate a partial Mantel correlation with the 13 geo-climatic variables. Population structure kinship was included in the test to control population stratification. Partial Mantel tests were conducted using the 'ecodist' package in R. A threshold of p&lt;0.01, corrected for multiple testing (8.33\u00d710<sup>-4</sup>), was set to call statistically correlated variables. In addition to using the partial Mantel test, we also applied linear models to regress CN as a function of the climatic variables. Although this method does not control for population structure, it largely confirmed the associations found by the partial Mantel test."

Insertions with different allele counts (private, shared by 2\u201310 accessions, shared by &gt;10 accessions) were considered separately. TE distribution in the reference genome (TAIR10) was obtained by counting the number of TE sequences located within pericentromeres (minus genomic regions showing aberrant coverage and inner pericentromeres). The expected distribution for the 2835 non-reference TE insertions with TSDs was calculated by randomizing 10<sup>6</sup> times their position across the chromosomes (genomic regions showing coverage deviation, the inner pericentromeres, or coordinates spanning the corresponding reference TE sequence were excluded). This set of random positions was used as a control for all subsequent analyses. Insertion distribution over genes and neighboring sequences was performed using a meta-gene. Briefly, protein coding gene features were extracted from the TAIR10 annotation and coordinates of non-reference TE insertions with TSDs were crossed with the set of genic features according to the following stepwise hierarchy: 5\u2019 UTR &gt; 3\u2019 UTR&gt; exon &gt; intron &gt; intergenic regions. For insertions that do not overlap protein-coding genes, the distance to the closest gene was calculated and reported as negative or positive distance according to the gene orientation. Expected insertion distribution under the null hypothesis was retrieved by applying this procedure for each of the 10<sup>6</sup> randomized sets of insertions. To assess if non-reference TE insertions with TSDs are enriched within small clusters, we divided the genome into 10\u00a0kb non-overlapping windows and we counted the number of insertions events within them. The observed and expected (random) densities of non-reference TE insertions with TSDs per window were compared and significant enrichment was declared when the number of insertions found within a window was in the upper 0.005% tail of the random distribution."

It shows that TE copy number can be treated as a quantitative trait and that loci influencing it can be mapped. It also shows tantalizing evidence that TE copy numbers for some families are correlated with climate, which may provide insight into function and evolution. It provides strong evidence that TEs generally insert randomly across the genome, and that the strong bias towards pericentromeric regions is likely a consequence of purifying selection. This paper also provides evidence that many of the DNA methylation polymorphisms identified in <i>A. thaliana</i> are caused by TE insertions, which show complex interactions with nearby genes."
