Modes of gastrulation range from stochastic translocation of individual cells to coordinated infolding of an epithelial sheet. How such morphogenetic differences are genetically encoded and whether they have provided specific developmental advantages is unclear. Here we identify two genes, <i>folded gastrulation</i> and <i>t48</i>, which in the evolution of fly gastrulation acted as a likely switch from an ingression of individual cells to the invagination of the blastoderm epithelium. Both genes are expressed and required for mesoderm invagination in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> but do not appear during mesoderm ingression of the midge <i>Chironomus riparius</i>. We demonstrate that early expression of either or both of these genes in <i>C.riparius</i> is sufficient to invoke mesoderm invagination similar to <i>D.melanogaster</i>. The possible genetic simplicity and a measurable increase in developmental robustness might explain repeated evolution of similar transitions in animal gastrulation."

To establish whether differences between ingression and invagination could be studied by a careful analysis of cell positions in fixed tissue, we used staining of F-actin and DNA as a\u00a0proxy for the cytoskeletal cell outline and nuclei, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). In both species, we found that the position of mesoderm cells during progression of mesoderm formation could be approximated by their nuclei (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,E\u2019</a>). To establish equivalent time points of mesoderm internalization during the courses of gastrulation in <i>C.riparius</i> and <i>D.melanogaster</i>, we compared the timing of mesoderm internalization in both species relative to a conserved and independent process of fly gastrulation, i.e., germband extension (<a href=\"#bib5\">Anderson, 1966</a>). We found that relative to the onset of germband extension, mesoderm internalization started and ended earlier in <i>D.melanogaster</i> than in <i>C.riparius</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In transversal sections of <i>C.riparius</i> embryos that were about halfway through internalization, mesodermal cells clustered on top of a shallow groove along the ventral midline, while at a comparable stage in <i>D.melanogaster</i> they formed part of a deep ventral furrow (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B,F</a>).

These differences were more pronounced in <i>C.riparius</i> embryos than in <i>D.melanogaster</i> and indicated that the classification of cell internalization in fixed embryos as either ingressive or invaginative could not be based on qualitative measures of transversal sections alone. Thus, to account for variation in the mode of cell internalization within and between individuals, we established measures to quantitatively distinguish mesoderm ingression and invagination\u00a0in whole embryos. Specifically, we quantified cell behavior during mesoderm internalization by using parameters that have been used to characterize this process in <i>D.melanogaster</i>. These included the total number of cells within the future mesoderm that underwent mitosis, the width and depth of the ventral furrow, the number of cells along the ventral midline that were internalized, a measurement of epithelial integrity, and the maximal depth at which an internalized cell could be observed (<a href=\"#bib14\">Costa et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kam et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McMahon et al., 2008</a>). Mitosis was detected by antibody staining against phosphorylated histone H3. All remaining features were quantified by approximating cell position based on the position of the nuclei relative to the computationally reconstructed egg and epithelial surfaces (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the assessment of maximal cell internalization and furrow depth, the analysis based on nuclear cell position proved particularly beneficial as it was independent of cell orientation and avoided discrimination against distinct modes of mesoderm internalization. All features were evaluated for nine transversal sections of a ventral window for each embryo (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While mitosis was rarely detected in either species during mesoderm internalization, wild-type embryos of <i>C.riparius</i> and <i>D.melanogaster</i> exhibited significant divergence in all other parameters (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>)."

Accordingly, invagination in <i>D.melanogaster</i> was characterized by high tissue integrity, a deep ventral furrow, and a high number of internalized cells, while ingression in <i>C.riparius</i> was characterized by low tissue integrity, a shallow ventral furrow, and a lower number of internalized cells. The number of internalized cells as well as the depth of the ventral furrow may be in part depended on the size of the mesoderm anlage and thus contain a species-specific component, whereas integrity was independent of the size of the mesoderm anlage. Collectively, the identified features made it possible to distinguish between ingressive and invaginative mesoderm formation in <i>C.riparius</i> and <i>D.melanogaster</i> precisely and quantitatively, despite variations within and between individuals."

A second fog orthologue, <i>Cri-fog2</i>, was expressed prior to mesoderm internalization in the central third of the embryo, in a domain broader than that seen for the expression of <i>Cri-twi</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L,L\u2019</a>). This suggested that the GPCR ligand it encodes and, by extension, its receptor <i>Cri-</i>Mist, may not play the same prominent role in <i>C.riparius</i> mesoderm formation as they do in <i>D.melanogaster</i>. This interpretation was consistent with a visual inspection of embryos after RNAi knockdown of either gene. Following the quantitative analysis, we found that the median cell internalization and furrow depth differed in <i>Cri-mist</i> RNAi embryos from water injected embryos\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Following early ubiquitous expression of <i>Cri-fog</i> and <i>Cri-t48, C.riparius</i> embryos responded with an invagination of the mesoderm which resembled that seen with the <i>D.melanogaster</i> forms of <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), suggesting that a gain of early ubiquitous expression of one or both of these molecules was sufficient for the induction of mesoderm invagination.

Upon early ubiquitous expression of either <i>Cri-fog</i> or <i>Cri-t48</i> alone, <i>C.riparius</i> embryos displayed induced furrows overall, with increased epithelial integrity and deeper internalization very similar to the features observed in <i>Cri-fog</i> and <i>Cri-t48</i> double-injected embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Differences were noted in the behavior of cells within individual embryos: these appeared less variable in embryos expressing <i>Cri-fog</i> than in embryos expressing <i>Cri-t48</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our results indicate that <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> operate differently in transmitting instructions to the cytoskeleton, while at the same time demonstrating that gaining early expression of either gene alone was sufficient to invoke a change in the mode of mesoderm internalization. This interpretation was further supported by converse experiments in <i>D.melanogaster</i>.

Our observations in <i>C.riparius</i> suggested that expression of either <i>Cri-fog</i> or <i>Cri-t48</i> was already sufficient for a morphogenetic response that appeared indistinguishable from the expression of both genes together. This seemingly redundant control of mesoderm invagination in <i>D.melanogaster</i> prompted us to speculate that features beyond cell internalization were associated with a tissue-wide invagination. In comparison with individual cells, a coherent epithelium provides increased mechanical stability (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</a>). In the context of mesoderm internalization, this stability of a coordinated invagination could provide robustness against physical perturbations that are widely present during fly gastrulation as the germband expands and the midgut invaginates (<a href=\"#bib14\">Costa et al., 1993</a>). To test whether variation within <i>C.riparius</i> gastrulation could be reduced by early ectopic expression of <i>Cri-fog</i> and <i>Cri-t48</i>, we collected and compared all time-independent measures of mesoderm internalization between control-injected and <i>fog</i>/<i>t48</i> injected embryos (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

Our data suggest that mesoderm invagination in <i>C.riparius</i> increases developmental robustness and efficiency. Additionally, invagination preserves the epithelial character of the mesoderm during internalization and thus decouples epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the mesoderm from the\u00a0positional cell exchange during germband extension. As a result, the anterior-to-posterior order of mesoderm cells may\u00a0be\u00a0more effectively preserved throughout gastrulation.

This observation was unexpected and surprising. In order for <i>C.riparius</i> embryos to respond to the\u00a0early ubiquitous expression of <i>fog</i> or <i>t48</i> in a spatially restricted manner along the ventral midline, the activity of either gene was\u00a0apparently realized differently in different regions of the <i>C.riparius</i> blastoderm embryo. A strong and exclusively ventral response to <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> activity in <i>C.riparius</i> could explain such\u00a0a local change in the mode of morphogenesis in spite of ubiquitous gene expression. Recent work has shown that ancestral modes of gastrulation can be built upon a gene repertoire that is in part distinct from the network known in <i>D.melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pers et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Stappert et al., 2016</a>), and the local response to ubiquitous <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> activity in <i>C.riparius</i> embryos may thus be elicited by an unknown <i>fog/t48</i> sensitive pathway under control of <i>twist</i> and/or <i>snail</i>. Alternatively, ectopic <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> in <i>C.riparius</i> act through a conserved genetic cascade present also in <i>D.melanogaster</i>.

A possible candidate for such a conserved component with spatially restricted activity downstream of <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> is the G-protein coupled receptor Mist. In embryos of both species, <i>C.riparius</i> and <i>D.melanogaster, mist</i> is expressed in a narrow domain along the ventral midline (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,F\u2019,N,N\u2019</a>)."

Our results in wildtype <i>C.riparius</i> embryos suggest that under such conditions, cells undergo an early epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and leave the blastoderm stochastically due to individual rather than collective cell shape changes. This cell behavior changes under conditions that increase RhoGEF2 activity at the apex of mesoderm cells, which may be achieved in two ways: either non-cell-autonomously, by increasing GPCR signaling strength through elevated levels of the secreted ligand Fog, or cell-autonomously, by improving GPCR signaling efficiency through the apically enriched membrane anchor T48 (<a href=\"#bib36\">K\u00f6lsch et al., 2007</a>).

Without an overt genetic directionality, mesoderm formation in flies has thus evolved either from a Drosophila-like ancestor that essentially lost maternal as well as zygotic <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> expression in <i>C.riparius</i>, or from a Chironomus-like ancestor that gained early embryonic <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> expression in successive steps leading to the developmental network described for <i>D.melanogaster</i>. We cannot exclude that <i>C.riparius</i> evolved from a Drosophila-like ancestor by a secondary loss of early <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> expression, and recent lineage-specific gene duplications, resulting, e.g., in two <i>fog</i> copies or <i>pangolin</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Klomp et al., 2015</a>), suggest that <i>C.riparius</i> may have diverged significantly from the last common ancestor of flies. Overall however, we favor the hypothesis that <i>C.riparius</i> rather than <i>D.melanogaster</i> is more reminiscent of ancestral mesoderm internalization in flies. Supporting this view, mesoderm ingression has been reported for an independent family at the base of the insect order of flies (Diptera), <i>A.gambiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Goltsev et al., 2007</a>), in the beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Handel et al., 2005</a>), and reflects the general view that mesoderm formation in insects evolved from an ancestor with an ingression-like mode of cell internalization (<a href=\"#bib63\">Roth, 2004</a>)."

Our results in <i>C.riparius</i> suggest that high levels of maternal-like ubiquitous expression of <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> are sufficient to invoke mesoderm invagination. Consistent with a critical role of maternal <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> in the evolutionary origin of mesoderm invagination, both genes are also expressed ubiquitously in pre-blastoderm embryos of <i>D.melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Costa et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Strutt and White, 1994</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, so far only a weak maternal contribution has been functionally demonstrated for <i>fog</i> (<a href=\"#bib78\">Zusman and Wieschaus, 1985</a>), and the main function of both genes in <i>D.melanogaster</i> mesoderm invagination is derived from their zygotic, twist-dependent ventral expression (<a href=\"#bib15\">Costa et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">K\u00f6lsch et al., 2007</a>). Thus, mesoderm invagination in <i>D.melanogaster</i> originated by the origin of highly specific Twist-dependent enhancers in <i>fog</i> or <i>t48</i> and later the gain of maternal expression in both genes, or vice versa. We favor the idea that the origin of mesoderm invagination was built on the gain of a maternal enhancer, which may evolve more likely <i>de novo</i> from random sequence turnover."

However, in <i>D.melanogaster</i>, the functions of <i>fog, mist,</i> and RhoGEF2 do not appear to be limited to gastrulation; the genes have been additionally implicated in gastrulation-like folding of epithelia during wing, leg, and salivary gland morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Manning et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nikolaidou and Barrett, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ratnaparkhi and Zinn, 2007</a>), and the presence of <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> orthologues in insect genomes overlaps with the phylogenetic occurrence of winged appendages and salivary glands (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krenn and Asp\u00f6ck, 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We therefore favor a model in which <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> have played a role in epithelial morphogenesis, at least during late stages of development, long before the origin of mesoderm invagination. Both genes were then subsequently recruited for a function in modern, Drosophila-like gastrulation with a delayed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Such recruitments may occur independently and repeatedly, and it will be informative to study a possible role of <i>fog</i> and <i>t48</i> in hymenopterans.

The ROI was sampled by nine equal-sized intervals, each containing approximately 30 cells. Based on empirical thresholding, a cell was classified as internalized if the distance between its nucleus center and the reconstructed epithelial surfaceegg\u00a0shell exceeded the length of one cell nucleus; it was independently classified as ingressed if the distance between nucleus center and the reconstructed reconstructed epithelial surface exceeded the length of one cell nucleus. Morphological parameters were then defined as follows: <i>internalization</i> - percentage of internalized nuclei in ROI; <i>maximal cell depth -</i> maximal measured distance between any nucleus center and the reconstructed egg shell in a transversal section; <i>integrity</i>: percentage of internalized cells that are not ingressed; <i>furrow depth</i>: maximal measured distance between internalized nucleus center and reconstructed egg shell in a transversal section. The <i>furrow width</i> of the respective cross sections was measured manually as a percentage of the embryo width directly on the <i>zy</i> image stacks in <i>Fiji.</i> As our definition of <i>integrity</i> as quantitative measure was measured only for internalized cells, this method cannot directly account for cases where cells stay within an epithelium in close contact with the egg outline (e.g. <i>Cri-sna</i> RNAi) In this case, the quantification of integrity was extended to all cells in ROI, regardless of internalization."

Based only on parameter values and covariance, the analysis identified the two main axes along which variation in our data set was maximal. For all wild type sections, the resulting two principal components (PC1 and PC2) accounted for 57% and 21% of variance, respectively. A biplot for the PCA was generated to visualize the contribution of each of the parameters to the two principal components. To test whether parameter separation was dependent on variation in space (i.e. the position of a given transversal section along the anterior-to-posterior axis of an embryo) and developmental age (as measured by\u00a0% of GBE), we color-coded cross sections according to their position and developmental age."

In addition, <i>t48</i> and <i>fog</i> sequences were identified by recursive searches of insect genomes with a position-specific scoring matrix (pssm). The pssm was generated in a psi-blast (<a href=\"#bib3\">Altschul et al., 1997</a>) against non-redundant translated genome databases of representative insect genomes using two iterations and standard parameters. To identify orthologue candidates, this pssm was used in a psi-blast of individual insect genomes with an e-value cut-off at 0.001. For each searched genome, the top three contigs were selected and submitted to a reciprocal blast to identify the closest homologous gene match as well as putative species-specific gene duplications. In the first iteration, the pssm was generated using the <i>D.melanogaster</i> proteins T48 (GenBank, CAA55003.1) and Fog (GenBank, NP_523438), and the reciprocal blast was performed in the translated <i>D.melanogaster</i> transcriptome (BDGP5). In each following iteration, the pssm was generated using the closest homologous gene match identified in the species that was most closely related to the species used to generate the pssm in the previous search.

No arguments are presented that would address the directionality, whether <i>Drosophila</i> has gained the expression or whether Chironomus has lost the expression of T48/Fog in the mesoderm anlage. The argumentation that Chironomus has lost the expression of T48 and Fog in the mesoderm anlage is equally valid.
