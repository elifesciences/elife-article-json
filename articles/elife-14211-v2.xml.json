When a signal travelling along one neuron reaches a synapse, it triggers the release of molecules known as neurotransmitters.

Neurotransmitters are stored in compartments called synaptic vesicles and their release from the first neuron depends on the synaptic vesicles fusing with the membrane that surrounds the cell.

The core machinery governing the process includes the SNAREs synaptobrevin, syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, which form tight SNARE complexes to bridge synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane and catalyze membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sutton et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Weber et al., 1998</a>).

The C2A and C2B domains adopt similar structures and bind three and two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, respectively, through their Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops located at the top of the structures (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fernandez et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Shao et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sutton et al., 1995</a>). These loops mediate penetration of Syt1 C2 domains to acidic membranes containing phosphatidylserine (PS) in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and this activity is required for the triggering function of Syt1 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chapman and Davis, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fernandez-Chacon et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rhee et al., 2005</a>). In addition, Syt1 readily binds to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) via its C2B domain in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner, which helps increase the apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of Syt1 and thereby enhances release probability (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bai et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">van den Bogaart et al., 2011a</a>). Furthermore, Syt1 binds to SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1, and to SNARE complexes mainly through its C2B domain, which is believed to position Syt1 on the pre-fusion SNARE complexes to trigger release in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brewer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">de Wit et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mohrmann et al., 2013</a>)."

It has been found that disrupting Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to C2B impairs release much more strongly than disruption of C2A Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in vivo\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Mackler et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Nishiki and Augustine, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Robinson et al., 2002</a>).Moreover, previous work showed that isolated C2B, instead of C2A, can promote SNARE-dependent membrane fusion in response to Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Gaffaney et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Xue et al., 2008</a>). These findings suggested that C2B plays a more preponderant role than C2A in neurotransmitter release. A number of studies have revisited this issue and suggested that the functional importance of C2B arises partly from its ability to deform membranes. For instance, C2B can induce vesicle clustering and/or membrane curvature in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arac et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Martens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hui et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Xue et al., 2008</a>). However, it is unclear why C2B has such membrane-deformation activity while C2A does not, given the fact that both C2 domains of Syt1 exhibit similar Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane-insertion properties in vitro."

However, these studies have yielded conflicting results. For instance, a recently solved Syt1\u2013SNARE complex crystal structure showed a relatively large binding interface between Syt1 and the SNARE complex that involves two basic residues (Arg398 and Arg399, referred to as the R398 R399 region, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) on the bottom of C2B (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>), whereas another dynamic Syt1\u2013SNARE complex structure model obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indicated a SNARE binding interface that is located on the polybasic patch (Lys326 and Lys327, referred to as the K326 K327 region, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) at the side of C2B (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brewer et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, both of these basic regions have been previously implicated in binding to acidic membrane lipids, such as PS and PI(4,5)P2 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Xue et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">van den Bogaart et al., 2011a</a>). Some other reports argued against the interaction between Syt1 and the SNARE complex, and suggested that the triggering function of Syt1 requires specific binding of C2B to acidic membranes rather than binding to SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Honigmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Park et al., 2015</a>). Taken together, although it seems clear that C2B can interact with either acidic SNARE complexes or acidic membranes due to the abundance of highly positive charges around its surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), the binding mode of C2B with SNARE complexes and membranes underlying the actual mechanism of Syt1 in release remains elusive."

Conversely, an acidic patch located in the middle portion of the SNARE complex (e.g., residues D51, E52, and E55 on SNAP-25, likely with adjacent residues on syntaxin-1, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>) has been suggested to mediate binding to C2B (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brewer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mohrmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>). Using the GST pull-down assay, we first re-examined interactions between the two basic regions on C2B and the acidic patch on the assembled SNARE complex in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brewer et al., 2015</a>), we found that both C2AB (soluble fragment of Syt1 harboring C2A and C2B) and C2B bound to assembled SNARE complexes, whereas C2A did not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, note that the C2A binding might be too weak to be detected on the gel). The SNARE complex containing the SNAP-25 D51A/E52A/E55A mutation (referred to as SN25 3M) showed impaired binding ability to C2B (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), in agreement with previous findings (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brewer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mohrmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>). Note that the SNARE complex bearing SN25 3M was less resistant to SDS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), yet its assembly was normal (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). As expected, disruption of the C2B Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (D363N/D365N, referred to as C2b) caused no effect on the SNARE complex binding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). However, disruption of either the K326 K327 region or the R398 R399 region (K326A/K327A, K326E/K327E or R398Q/R399Q, referred to as C2B<sub>2KA</sub>, C2B<sub>2KE</sub> or C2B<sub>2RQ</sub>, respectively) impaired binding of C2B to the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), indicating that\u00a0both basic regions of C2B contribute to the SNARE complex binding. This data reproduced previously contradictory findings (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brewer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>), suggesting heterogeneous interactions between C2B and the SNARE complex in solution (<a href=\"#bib31\">Park et al., 2015</a>)."

PI(4,5)P2 selectively localizes to the plasma membrane, binds to Syt1 and plays crucial functions in neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib42\">van den Bogaart et al., 2011b</a>). Using a liposome co-flotation assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), we found that, in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, both C2AB and C2B (wild type, WT) bound efficiently to liposomes containing 1% PI(4,5)P2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). This PI(4,5)P2-binding ability of Syt1 relies on the K326 K327 region but not the R398 R399\u00a0region, as C2AB<sub>2KE</sub>/C2AB<sub>2KA</sub> or\u00a0C2B<sub>2KE</sub>/C2B<sub>2KA</sub> completely abolished binding to PI(4,5)P2-containing liposomes whereas C2AB<sub>2RQ</sub> or C2B<sub>2RQ</sub> did not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). To confirm this binding preference, we measured the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) labeled C2B and rhodamine-labeled liposomes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hui et al., 2011</a>) containing 1% PI(4,5)P2 in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. When NBD was placed close to the K326 K327 region (H315C-NBD), we detected a robust energy transfer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). Comparably, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent FRET signals were considerably weaker when PI(4,5)P2 was removed from liposomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). The addition of excess assembled SNARE complexes in the reaction caused no obvious effect on the FRET between C2B and PI(4,5)P2-containing liposomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). These results, together with a recent finding that Syt1 binds to PI(4,5)P2-containing liposomes in physiological ionic conditions that contain ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Park et al., 2015</a>), suggest that the K326 K327 region binds specifically to PI(4,5)P2-containing membranes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>."

Previous studies suggested that the R398 R399 region binds acidic membranes (i.e., PS) and participates in liposome clustering (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arac et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Xue et al., 2008</a>). In our study using PS-containing liposomes, we indeed found that C2B clustered liposomes in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Both C2B<sub>2RQ</sub> and C2b failed to cluster liposomes, while C2B<sub>2KE</sub> was able to cluster liposomes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), supporting the idea that the bottom R398 R399 region and the top Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops associate two opposite acidic membranes in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Xue et al., 2008</a>). However, it is noteworthy that the PS-containing liposomes used in these experiments lacked the SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arac et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Xue et al., 2008</a>). We therefore re-analyzed the liposome-clustering activity of C2B in the presence of soluble SNARE complexes, as a function of the concentrations of C2B. Robust clustering was observed as the C2B concentration increased\u00a0in the presence of 1\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). To our surprise, the addition of 10\u2009\u03bcM soluble SNARE complexes in the reaction strongly impaired liposome clustering but the clustering was capable of gradually recovery as the concentration of C2B exceeded that of SNARE complexes (when C2B was above 10\u2009\u03bcM, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Thus, the likely explanation is that the weaker R398 R399\u2013PS interaction can be replaced by the stronger R398 R399\u2013SNARE complex binding. These results suggest that the R398 R399 region binds preferentially to SNARE complexes rather than acidic membranes."

Previous studies have observed a strong binding of C2B to membranes owing to the insertion of the C2B Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops into PS-containing liposomes in the presence of 1\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arac et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hui et al., 2011</a>). However, such strong binding would hinder the detection of interactions of C2B with PI(4,5)P2 or membrane-anchored SNARE complexes at the same time in our co-flotation experiments. To alleviate such an effect, we applied higher ion strength (250\u2009mM KCl, instead of 150\u2009mM KCl used in other experiments throughout the work) and weakened the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops\u2013Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u2013PS interaction by lowering the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from 1\u2009mM to 0.1\u2009mM (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the condition containing 250\u2009mM KCl and 0.1\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we could not detect the interaction between C2B and PS-containing liposomes when the SNAREs were absent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As such, we could not detect binding of C2B to membrane-anchored <i>cis</i>-SNARE complexes in the absence PS or Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Efficient binding was only observed when <i>cis</i>-SNARE complexes and PS were both present on liposomes in the presence of 0.1\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Intriguingly, inclusion of 1% PI(4,5)P2 on liposomes that already contain PS and <i>cis</i>-SNARE complexes dramatically enhanced C2B binding in the presence of 0.1\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, leaving very little C2B left in the pellet (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). In contrast, selective removal of PS, PI(4,5)P2 or <i>cis</i>-SNARE complexes on liposomes led to strong impairment of C2B binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>), suggesting a synergy among the C2B (Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u2013binding loops)\u2013Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u2013PS, C2B (K326 K327)\u2013PI(4,5)P2 and C2B (R398 R399)\u2013SNARE complex interactions in the presence of 0.1\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>."

We first monitored insertion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops into membranes in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. For this purpose, we introduced cysteine mutations at the C2B T285W Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop 2 or 3 (T285W N333C or T285W I367C, respectively, see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and then labeled them separately with NBD and monitored their membrane-insertion abilities. Note that as an environment-sensitive probe, NBD exhibits a large increase in fluorescence intensity when it is transferred from an aqueous to a hydrophobic environment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Crowley et al., 1993</a>). In the presence of 1\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, addition of either T285W N333C-NBD or T285W I367C-NBD to liposomes containing PS and <i>cis</i>-SNARE complexes caused a marked increase in intensity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>), confirming that the loops insert into membranes. In contrast, when additional 1% PI(4,5)P2 was applied, both T285W N333C-NBD and T285W I367C-NBD showed even higher intensities (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>), implying that the membrane-insertion ability of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops is enhanced with the assist of the C2B\u2013PI(4,5)P2 interaction. Obviously, compared to T285W N333C-NBD, T285W I367C-NBD exhibited a remarkable enhancement in intensity in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>), suggesting that the loop 3 located on the same side as the K326 K327 region (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) on C2B is more accessible to membranes. These results imply that the K326 K327 region of C2B persistently sticks to PI(4,5)P2 on the plasma membrane with the insertion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops into membranes. This supports the idea that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent pre-adsorption of the K326 K327 region to PI(4,5)P2-harboring membranes helps 'steer' the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered membrane insertion of Syt1 toward the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bai et al., 2004</a>)."

However, to what extent the promotion activity of C2AB (or C2B) in vitro reflects the triggering activity of Syt1 in vivo must be interpreted with caution because the liposome-clustering ability of C2AB (or C2B) correlated strongly with its activity in promoting SNARE-dependent liposome fusion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arac et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hui et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Xue et al., 2008</a>). Accelerated liposome fusion might arise from the enhanced membrane docking and SNARE pairing caused by C2AB (or C2B) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hui et al., 2011</a>). To detect the actual activity of C2AB (or C2B) in triggering fusion, in our liposome fusion system (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>) we utilized poly-D-lysine as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent factor to mimic liposome docking and increase SNARE pairing (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hui et al., 2011</a>); added complexin-1 to arrest liposomes in a 'ready-for-fusion' state (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kyoung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Diao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lai et al., 2014</a>); and finally applied 1\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to trigger fusion.

Consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hui et al., 2011</a>), addition of 2 \u00b5g/ml poly-D-lysine in the mixtures efficiently induced liposome clustering (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), thereby enhancing SNARE-dependent lipid mixing and content mixing in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (in the presence of 0.2\u2009mM EDTA, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,I</a>).

Complexin-1 inhibited both lipid mixing and content mixing in the presence of poly-D-lysine and in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,J</a>), whereas further addition of 1\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 1500\u2009s triggered both lipid mixing and content mixing (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,K</a>). Consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gaffaney et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Xue et al., 2008</a>), the triggering activity strictly required C2B instead of C2A (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,K</a>).

These results pinpoint the triggering activity of C2B in membrane fusion. Furthermore, to exclude the possibility that content-mixing signals represented by de-quenching of sulforhodamine fluorescence arise from liposome leakiness, we performed control experiments where both v- and t-liposome were loaded with sulforhodamine (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>).

Despite the fact that the functional significance of the C2B domain in vivo has been successfully reproduced in SNARE-dependent membrane fusion assays in vitro\u00a0the mechanism by which C2B acts with the SNAREs and membranes to promote fusion is unclear. In the present study, we suggest a membrane-bending property of the C2B domain that arises from its simultaneous interactions with SNARE complexes and membranes.

Contiguously electrostatic potentials created by the bottom R398 R399 residues and the side K326 K327 residues of C2B contribute to the SNARE binding, as observed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>. However, as demonstrated with our co-flotation and FRET experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013G</a>), the presence of PI(4,5)P2-containing membranes shifts the equilibrium towards an energetically favorable binding where the K326 K327\u2013PI(4,5)P2 interaction dominates. The much higher efficiency of the K326 K327\u00a0region, compared to the R398 R399 region, in PI(4,5)P2 binding arises most likely because the K326 K327\u00a0region contains a much higher positive-charge density, which enables it to bind tightly to lipid head groups with a highly negative-charge density [i.e., PI(4,5)P2-microdomains at active zones] (<a href=\"#bib14\">Honigmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Joung et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Park et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with this, further investigations on the C2B\u2013SNARE complex interaction using a more sensitive bimane-tryptophan quenching assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>) indicate that the R398 R399 region of C2B binds to the SNARE complex or the membrane-anchored SNARE complex in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner. Thus, the existence of the K326 K327\u2013PI(4,5)P2 interaction and the R398 R399\u2013SNARE complex interaction prior to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx likely recruits Syt1 to the fusion sites, which underlies the docking function of Syt1, as suggested previously (<a href=\"#bib8\">de Wit et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Honigmann et al., 2013</a>)."

However, Syt1 used in the study was labeled at residue 342, which is close to the polybasic patch, suggesting that this study actually measured the FRET between the K326 K327 region and the SNARE complex, and it is unlikely that it reflects the real Syt1\u2013SNARE complex interaction. Instead, our study found that the R398 R399\u2013SNARE complex interaction persists in the absence and presence of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). It is also noteworthy that C2B T285W and SNAP-25 R59C mutations used in our bimane-tryptophan quenching assay seem unlikely to affect the particular interaction between Syt1 and the SNARE complex, because these residues are outside the 'primary' interface (interface area: 720 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>; including residues Arg398 and Arg399) between Syt1 and the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>). In addition, the C<sup>\u03b1</sup>\u2013C<sup>\u03b1</sup> distance between the two labeling sites is measured at ~12\u2009\u00c5 based on the Syt1\u2013SNARE complex structures (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>), consistent with the relatively large effect on the FRET observed in our experiments.

Thus, our binding results, together with the observations that both spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release are not affected by the presence of 3\u2009mM ATP (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>), strongly suggest that the interaction between Syt1 and the SNARE complex is not affected by ionic shielding and is physiologically relevant."

This discrepancy may arise from the different experimental conditions used between the present work and our previous studies. Re-examination of liposome clustering in a more stringent condition containing abundant SNARE complexes showed that the liposome-clustering ability of C2B is totally abrogated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>).

The presence of the simultaneous SNARE-containing membrane binding of the top Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops, of the side K326 K327 region, and of the bottom R398 R399 region, leads to a possible membrane-deformation mechanism of Syt1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>): before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, both the K326 K327\u2013PI(4,5)P2 interaction and the R398 R399\u2013SNARE complex interaction fasten C2B in an orientation parallel with the plasma membrane, leaving the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops held back from membrane insertion (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>); Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx strongly induces fast insertion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops into membranes, rearranging C2B to an orientation vertical to the plasma membrane. The persistent binding of C2B to PI(4,5)P2 and the membrane-anchored SNARE complex would thus exert a membrane bending force to buck the local membrane outward in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Furthermore, it is likely that binding of C2B to PI(4,5)P2 and SNARE complexes before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx would lead to a ring-like arrangement of C2B molecules around the fusion pore (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), which would then facilitate bucking local membranes upon collective bending forces in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This possible membrane-deformation mechanism is in good agreement with the Syt1 working model proposed by Brunger and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>), and is supported by a recent observation that local membrane protrusions (5 nm in height, similar to the size of one C2B molecule) bucked on the surface of GUV (giant unilamellar vesicles) require the presence of Syt1 and assembled SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bharat et al., 2014</a>)."

This membrane-deformation mechanism explains very well the recent observation that isolated C2B readily bends membranes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hui et al., 2009</a>), and suggests that membrane insertion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops alone is not sufficient to drive membrane deformation without the assist of the R398 R399\u00a0and the K326 K327 regions. Thus, the functional importance of the C2B Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites observed in previous\u00a0in vivo studies and our present liposome fusion experiments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>) can be explained: disruption of the C2B Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites abrogates the simultaneous interaction of C2B with acidic membrane lipids [i.e., PI(4,5)P2 and PS] and the membrane-anchored SNARE complex, so that the ability of C2B to bend membranes is absolutely abolished. Our data reinforce the idea that local membrane deformation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u2013Syt1 is key for the triggering function of Syt1 in release (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hui et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>).

In response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, C2B-induced membrane bucking would reduce the distance between two apposed membranes, which might cooperate with the action of C2B in displacing inhibitory complexin-1, to facilitate the continuous helical SNARE complex assembly that propagates through the linker region into the transmembrane domains (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Thus, high curvature stresses induced by C2B and the energy released from the C-terminal SNARE complex assembly might be coupled together in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> to overcome the energy barrier for membrane fusion. It is noteworthy that C2A would have an ancillary role by binding to one membrane and helping to dictate the apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of Syt1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Robinson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>).

Moreover, Zhou et al. proposed that the C2B-SNARE complex unit exists prior to calcium binding and then moves as a block, deforming the membrane by simultaneous three interactions with the membrane involving the polybasic region of Syt1, the calcium binding loops of Syt1 C2B, and the membrane anchor and juxtamembrane region of syntaxin and SNAP-25, similar to the model proposed in this manuscript."

The authors revisited three proposed key interactions of the Syt-1 C2B domain \u2013 (i) calcium-dependent binding of the calcium binding loops to membranes with PS, (ii) binding of basic residues K326/327 to membranes with PIP2, and (iii) binding of basic residues R398/399 to the SNARE complex. The data indicate that all three interactions occur simultaneously and are all required for the triggering function the Syt-1 C2B domain in liposome/vesicle fusion. The findings reconcile recently published contradictory data on the functional significance of SNARE complex binding by Syt-1 (e.g. Park et al., 2015 vs. Zhou et al., 2015) \u2013 the discrepancy of the present data with those of Park et al.

Thus, these mutations are unlikely going to affect this particular interaction between Syt1 and SNARE complex. This is an important comment since unfortunate placement of labels have affected this interaction in work by others (Brewer et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015). Moreover, the Ca-Ca distance between the two labeling sites is ~ 12 A (based on the structures by Zhou et al.), consistent with the relatively large effect on FRET that the authors observe.

This study aims to resolve the SNARE and membrane binding modes of the C2B domain (in absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and how these interactions contribute to the fusion process. The authors utilize a number of techniques GST pulldown, coflotation, fluorescence measurements and in vitro fusion assays to demonstrate that mutation of side and bottom basic residues impair SNARE complex binding and membrane binding in a Ca dependent manner. This work is based on a large body of literature and the findings presented here are in part confirmatory and in part new. New is the finding that the interactions of the bottom loop with the membrane can be competitively displaced by the presence of SNARE complexes. Another aspect of the work is that the authors show that synaptotagmin C2B domain is able to double the rate of SNARE complex formation. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is that they can simultaneously monitor both penetration of C2B domain into the membrane and binding to the SNARE complex with the bottom loop at the same time, providing decent proof for the presence of a simultaneous binding of top loops to membranes and bottom loop to cis-SNARE complex via the acid patch created by SNAP25 residues. However, does this experiment exclude that a considerable fraction of the bottom loop would also be able to interact with the phospholipid membrane ?</i> "

Are all of these Syt1 molecules involved in binding with the SNARE complex? It is really hard to answer based on our bulk assay performed in vitro. However, we found that Syt1-dependent membrane clustering in the presence of calcium was much reduced in the presence of the SNARE complex, we also showed that the C2B2KE or C2B2KA mutations but not the C2B2RQ abolished PIP2 binding with co-flotation experiments. Furthermore, we detected the strong FRET between the bottom loop and the SNARE complex with or without Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a membrane environment. These results strongly suggest that a majority fraction of the C2B bottom loop interact with the SNARE complex. To data, we could not exclude the possibility that a fraction of the bottom loop bind membranes to promote release. We discussed this possibility in the Discussion (paragraph four). Nevertheless, further work will be required to answer this question by using single molecule FRET experiments."

These interactions were found to be crucial for the triggering activity of Syt1 in liposome fusion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

This hypothesis is in good agreement with a recent model proposed by Zhou et al., 2015, Nature. In addition, this hypothesis is supported by a recent observation (Bharat et al., 2014) that local membrane protrusions (5 nm in height, similar like the size of one C2B molecule) bucked on the surface of GUV require the presence of Syt1 and assembled SNARE complex."

For GST pull-down and liposome co-flotation assays, excess of the Syt1 fragments (10 \u03bcM) were used in order to saturate the binding. For lipid mixing, content mixing (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) and SNARE paring assays (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), equivalent amount of the Syt1 fragments (0.5 \u03bcM) compared to syntaxin-1\u2013SNAP-25 complex (0.5 \u03bcM) reconstituted on liposomes were used to avoid liposome cluster during calcium incorporation. For fluorescent measurements, especially FRET-based assays, the Syt1 fragments as a donor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>) were added to 5 \u03bcM in order to monitor the acceptor (rodamine) fluorescence as reported (Hui et al., 2011, NSMB); the Syt1 fragments as an acceptor (for all bimane-tryptophan quenching assays in the manuscript) were added to 5 \u03bcM for saturating the FRET, as demonstrated in the titration experiment in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. For liposome cluster assay in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, excess of Syt1 fragments (10 \u03bcM) were used for monitoring liposome cluster as reported (Arac et al., 2006, NSMB and Xue et al., 2008, NSMB).
