Derived primarily from the liver, it inhibits the iron exporter ferroportin in the gut and spleen, the sites of iron absorption and recycling respectively. Recently, we demonstrated that ferroportin is also found in cardiomyocytes, and that its cardiac-specific deletion leads to fatal cardiac iron overload. Hepcidin is also expressed in cardiomyocytes, where its function remains unknown. To define the function of cardiomyocyte hepcidin, we generated mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of hepcidin, or knock-in of hepcidin-resistant ferroportin. We find that while both models maintain normal systemic iron homeostasis, they nonetheless develop fatal contractile and metabolic dysfunction as a consequence of cardiomyocyte iron deficiency. These findings are the first demonstration of a cell-autonomous role for hepcidin in iron homeostasis. They raise the possibility that such function may also be important in other tissues that express both hepcidin and ferroportin, such as the kidney and the brain."

Derived primarily from the liver, it inhibits the iron exporter ferroportin in the gut and spleen, the sites of iron absorption and recycling respectively. Recently, we demonstrated that ferroportin is also found in cardiomyocytes, and that its cardiac-specific deletion leads to fatal cardiac iron overload. Hepcidin is also expressed in cardiomyocytes, where its function remains unknown. To define the function of cardiomyocyte hepcidin, we generated mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of hepcidin, or knock-in of hepcidin-resistant ferroportin. We find that while both models maintain normal systemic iron homeostasis, they nonetheless develop fatal contractile and metabolic dysfunction as a consequence of cardiomyocyte iron deficiency. These findings are the first demonstration of a cell-autonomous role for hepcidin in iron homeostasis. They raise the possibility that such function may also be important in other tissues that express both hepcidin and ferroportin, such as the kidney and the brain."

However, because too much iron in the body is also bad for health, mammals possess several proteins whose role is to maintain the balance of iron. Two proteins in particular, called hepcidin and ferroportin, are thought to be important in this process. Some ferroportin is found in the cells that line the gut (where iron is absorbed into the body) and is required to release this iron into the bloodstream. It is also found in the spleen, which is where iron is removed from old red blood cells so that it can be recycled. The liver produces hepcidin to control when ferroportin is active in the gut and spleen."

The experiments show that these changes caused fatal heart failure in the mice because ferroportin releases iron from heart cells in an uncontrolled manner. Lakhal-Littleton et al. were able to prevent heart failure by injecting the animals with iron directly into the bloodstream. These findings show that hepcidin produced outside the liver has a role in controlling the levels of iron in the body\u2019s organs."

Conversely, excess iron participates in cytotoxic Fenton-type chemical reactions. Thus, both iron deficiency and iron overload are detrimental to the cell. Therefore, the healthy functioning of tissues requires tight control of intracellular iron levels. These in turn are dependent both on cellular homeostatic pathways controlling iron uptake, usage, and storage, and on systemic pathways controlling iron levels in the plasma. In mammals, cellular iron homeostasis is controlled by the Iron Regulatory Proteins IRPs. Intracellular iron levels control the degradation of IRP2 and the conformational switch that confers the RNA-binding function of IRP1. IRPs in turn control the levels of iron uptake proteins such as transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and divalent metal transporter (DMT1), and the iron storage protein ferritin (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rouault and Klausner, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rouault, 2006</a>). Systemic iron homeostasis is controlled by the hepcidin/ferroportin axis at the sites of iron entry into the circulation. Ferroportin (FPN), which is encoded by the Solute Carrier Family 40 Member 1 (<i>Slc40a1</i>), is the only known mammalian iron export protein and mediates iron release into the circulation from duodenal enterocytes, splenic reticuloendothelial macrophages and hepatocytes, the sites of iron absorption, recycling and storage respectively (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ganz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Donovan et al., 2005</a>). FPN-mediated iron release is antagonized by the hormone hepcidin, also known as hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (HAMP). Produced primarily in the liver, hepcidin binds to and induces internalization of FPN, thereby limiting iron release into the circulation and its availability to peripheral tissues (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nemeth et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Qiao et al., 2012</a>). The importance of the HAMP/FPN axis is illustrated by diseases of systemic iron overload such as hemochromatosis and \u03b2-thalassaemia, where hepcidin production is impaired (<a href=\"#bib9\">Camaschella, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Musallam et al., 2012</a>), and in anaemia of chronic disease where hepcidin production is inappropriately elevated (<a href=\"#bib12\">De Falco et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Nemeth and Ganz, 2014</a>)."

The function of this extra-hepatic hepcidin remains unknown, but one hypothesis is that it is involved in local iron control. Relevant to this hypothesis are our recent findings that FPN is also present in the heart, that it is essential for cardiomyocyte iron homeostasis and that its cardiomyocyte-specific deletion leads to fatal cardiac iron overload in mice (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lakhal-Littleton et al., 2015</a>).

We studied cardiac function and iron homeostasis longitudinally in both models and report that both develop fatal cardiac dysfunction and metabolic derangement as a consequence of cardiomyocyte iron deficiency.

Furin expression has been reported in the heart (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beaubien et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ichiki et al., 2013</a>), and we also found that its expression was upregulated in the hearts of mice provided an iron-deficient diet and in cardiomyocytes treated with DFO (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Other parameters of cardiac performance were not significantly altered between mice from the two genotypes (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Taken together, histological examination of the hearts and cine MRI studies indicated that <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> mice developed fatal LV dysfunction with reduced LVEF."

In order to test whether cardiac dysfunction arose from upregulation of cardiomyocyte FPN, we engineered mice where the <i>Slc40a1</i> gene harbours a conditional cardiac-specific C326Y point mutation, which confers HAMP-resistance while conserving the iron export function of FPN (<a href=\"#bib44\">Schimanski et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Drakesmith et al., 2005</a>). We confirmed that the <i>Slc40a1 C326Y</i> fl allele produced the C326Y transcript specifically in the heart (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and that <i>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> mice did not exhibit changes in systemic iron indices (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>).

We then determined whether <i>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> mice developed the same phenotype of cardiac dysfunction as <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> mice. Histologically, <i>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> hearts from six month old mice also showed LV enlargement (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), hypertrophied cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013F</a>), upregulation of hypertrophy markers <i>Myh7</i> and <i>Nppb</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>) and a greater degree of apoptosis compared to <i>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H\u2013I</a>).

Therefore, we tested whether this upregulation of FPN resulted in increased iron efflux from cardiomyocytes. Iron Fe55 efflux was indeed significantly greater in cardiomyocytes isolated from <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> and <i>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> hearts than in cardiomyocytes isolated from their respective controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3M</a>). Addition of exogenous mouse HAMP in the efflux medium inhibited the increase in Fe55 efflux from <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> cardiomyocytes but not from <i>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> cardiomyocytes, consistent with the HAMP-resistant mutation in <i>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> cardiomyocytes. We hypothesised that upregulation of cardiac FPN and iron export in <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> and <i>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> hearts caused cardiomyocyte iron depletion. To test this hypothesis, we quantified iron levels both in total hearts and in the isolated cardiomyocyte fractions at 3 months and 6 months of age. While iron levels in total hearts were not significantly different between any of the genotypes (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), the iron content of the cardiomyocyte fraction was significantly lower in <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> and in <i>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> mice than in their respective controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3N</a>). Furthermore, expression of TfR1 mRNA was upregulated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3O</a>) and Slc40a1 mRNA was downregulated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3P</a>) in <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> and <i>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> hearts relative to their respective controls, consistent with a transcriptional response to intracellular iron deficiency (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rouault and Klausner, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rouault, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ward and Kaplan, 1823</a>). Together these results demonstrate that loss of either cardiac hepcidin or hepcidin responsiveness in the heart results in upregulation of cardiomyocyte FPN, and that cardiomyocytes of <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> and <i>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> hearts are iron deficient as a result of upregulation of FPN-mediated iron export."

At this timepoint, we performed cine MRI and found that the LV enlargement and the reduced LVEF, seen in untreated <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> mice, were prevented in iron-treated <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>).

Iron is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in metabolism (<a href=\"#bib31\">Meyer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sono et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Solomon et al., 2003</a>), and metabolic derangement is a well-recognized precursor to cardiac dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib7\">Belke et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kakinuma et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ashrafian et al., 2007</a>). Iron deficiency has been reported to reduce the levels and/or activities of key metabolic iron-containing enzymes, in cell lines, in the hearts of mice with impaired cardiac iron uptake (cardiac-specific <i>TfR1</i> knockouts) and in the hearts of mice fed an iron-deficient diet (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dallman, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dhur et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Xu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Oexle et al., 1999</a>). Based on those studies, we postulated that iron deficiency in the cardiomyocytes of <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> mice would also result in reduction in the activities of key metabolic iron-containing enzymes. To test this hypothesis, we measured the activities of the iron-sulphur containing enzyme Aconitase I as well as electron transport chain (ETC) complexes in cardiac lysates from <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> hearts at 3 months and 6 months of age. We found that Aconitase I, Complex I and Complex IV activities were significantly reduced in <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> hearts compared to <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> controls at 3 months and 6 months of age, and that this reduction in activity was prevented in iron-treated 6-month old mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013H</a>). As ETC activity is essential to mitochondrial function, we examined whether <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> hearts had signs of mitochondrial failure, and whether such mitochondrial failure was prevented by intravenous iron supplementation. By electron microscopy (EM), dilation of mitochondrial cristae was seen in <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> hearts as early as 3 months of age and progressed further at 6 months of age. However, this was prevented in iron-treated <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> mice, which had healthy-looking mitochondria at 6 months of age (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Similar changes in mitochondrial morphology were seen in the hearts of 3 month old <i>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> mice (data not shown)."

Therefore, we examined the expression of a number of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. We found that expression of genes encoding Hexokinase 2 (<i>Hk2</i>) which catalyses the first step of glycolysis, Enolase (<i>Eno</i>), which catalyses the penultimate step of glycolysis and of Lactate dehydrogenase A (<i>Ldha)</i> which catalyses the ultimate step of glycolysis were all significantly increased at 3 months and 6 months of age in hearts of untreated <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> mice.

A role in cellular iron homeostasis, and an autocrine mode of action for the HAMP/FPN axis have not been described previously in any other tissue.

Metabolic and contractile dysfunction are preceded by cardiomyocyte iron deficiency and prevented by intravenous iron supplementation, indicating a causal relationship between cardiomyocyte iron deficiency and cardiac dysfunction. This causal relationship has previously been demonstrated in studies using mice lacking cardiac TfR1, in which cardiac iron deficiency also affects the heart against a background of otherwise intact systemic iron homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib56\">Xu et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, the importance of metabolic derangement seen in our mouse models is also consistent with the findings in mice lacking the cardiacTfR1, and in mice and rats fed iron deficient diets (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dhur et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Xu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tanne et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Walter et al., 2002</a>).

In that setting, release of the active mature HAMP peptide is dependent on cleavage of the propeptide by Furin (<a href=\"#bib52\">Valore and Ganz, 2008</a>). We found that Furin inhibition increased iron export from <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> but not from <i>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</i> cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 1</a>), demonstrating that cardiomyocytes secrete an active HAMP peptide in a Furin-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that increased HAMP release from iron-deficient cardiomyocytes depended on Furin, and that cardiac Furin itself is upregulated by iron deficiency both in vitro and in vivo. The latter finding is consistent with the reported regulation of Furin by iron deficiency through Hypoxia-Inducible Factors HIFs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Silvestri et al., 2008</a>). These data suggest that differential regulation of Furin by iron may explain the divergent effects of iron on Hamp transcript and HAMP protein. Comprehensive studies using cardiac-specific knockouts of putative regulators will be required to explore formally the regulation or otherwise, of cardiac hepcidin by pathways known to regulate hepatic hepcidin."

Therefore, the interplay between the cardiac and the systemic HAMP/FPN axes is important in determining cardiomyocyte iron levels. Some insight into this interplay is gained from comparing systemic and cardiac mouse models of disrupted iron homeostasis. It is interesting that ubiquitous <i>Hamp</i> knockout (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lakhal-Littleton et al., 2015</a>) and ubiquitous <i>Slc40a1 C326Y</i> knock-in mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 3</a>), both models of systemic iron overload, do not develop the cardiac dysfunction seen in cardiomyocyte-specific <i>Hamp</i> knockout and cardiomyocyte-specific <i>Slc40a1 C326Y</i> knock-in mice. This suggests that, while upregulation of cardiomyocyte FPN under conditions of normal iron availability (cardiac-specific models described in this study) is detrimental to cardiac function, it is protective under conditions of increased systemic iron availability (systemic models). Previously, we also showed that deletion of cardiomyocyte FPN resulted in fatal cardiomyocyte iron overload, preventable by dietary iron restriction (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lakhal-Littleton et al., 2015</a>). Together, our studies demonstrate that iron levels within cardiomyocytes are a balance between cellular iron efflux which is regulated by the cardiac HAMP/FPN axis, and systemic iron availability which is regulated by the systemic HAMP/FPN axis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

In this study, we have demonstrated that loss of cardiac HAMP (cardiac Hamp KO) or loss of cardiac HAMP responsiveness (cardiac Slc40a1 C326Y KI) result in cardiomyocyte iron deficiency due to increased cardiomyocyte FPN and iron release. Previously, we also demonstrated that loss of cardiomyocyte FPN caused cardiomyocyte iron overload. In these two sets of conditions, cardiomyocyte iron deficiency and cardiomyocyte iron overload cause cardiac dysfunction. We have also shown that upregulation of cardiac FPN occurs as a result of loss of either systemic HAMP or systemic HAMP responsiveness, and is protective against the otherwise detrimental effects of systemic iron overload."

The cradle was lowered into a vertical-bore, 11.7 T MR system with a 40 mm birdcage coil (Rapid Biomedical, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany) and visualised using a Bruker console running Paravision 2.1.1. A stack of contiguous 1 mm thick true short-axis ECG and respiration-gated cine-FLASH images were acquired. The entire in vivo imaging protocol was performed in approximately 60 min. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (NIH Image, Bethesda, MD). Left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions were calculated from the stack of cine images as described (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lakhal-Littleton et al., 2015</a>)."

                                "text": "A C57BL/6J mouse genomic BAC clone (RP23-183-P22) encompassing the <i>Slc40a1</i> gene was used for the generation of the targeting vector. A 12 kb region of the RP23-183-P22 encompassing exons 6\u20138 and surrounding intronic regions was subcloned by gap-repair into a plasmid containing a diphtheria toxin A chain negative selection cassette. The required C326Y point mutation was introduced into this subclone by site directed mutagenesis. In parallel, a loxP flanked neomycin/kanamycin selection cassette (from PL452\u00a0<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2003</a>) was inserted into the BAC within <i>Slc40a1</i> intron six by recombineering and an approximately 5 kb ApaI/PmeI fragment encompassing this insertion together with exons 6 and 7 and flanking introns was subcloned into pBluescript. This plasmid was treated with Cre recombinase (NEB) in vitro to remove the selection cassette, resulting in a plasmid containing a single loxP and an additional SpeI site within <i>Slc40a1</i> intron 6. This loxP interrupted sequence was shuttled into the genomic subclone by exchanging an internal NcoI fragment. A portion of <i>Slc40a1</i> cDNA corresponding to the coding region encoded on exons 7 and 8, including the 3\u2019 untranslated region was amplified by RT-PCR from cDNA prepared from embryonic mouse heart and inserted into a piece of synthetic DNA (Gene Art) corresponding to intronic and intergenic sequence lying immediately upstream of exon seven and downstream of exon 8, respectively. This minigene assembly was cloned upstream of an FRT-PGK-Neomycin-FRT-loxP selection cassette (from P451\u00a0<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2003</a>) and the two pieces together were inserted into the modified genomic subclone above via a unique SacII site, completing the final targeting vector. The completed targeting vector was linearised with AatII and electroporated into C57BL/6N JM8F6 embryonic stem cells. Following selection in 210 \u03bcg/ml G418, recombinant clones were screened by PCR to detect homologous recombination over the 3\u2019 arm. A forward primer (5\u2019- CAATAGCAGGCATGCTGGGGATG-3\u2019) binding within the polyadenylation of the selection cassette was used together with a reverse primer (5\u2019- GGCATCTGCTGTCTGTGAAA- 3\u2019) binding downstream of the 3\u2019 homology arm to amplify a 6.6 kb fragment from correctly recombined clones. Positive clones were examined for correct recombination at the 5\u2019 end by long range PCR using a forward primer (5\u2019- TGTACCATGGATGGGTCCTT-3\u2019) binding upstream of the 5\u2019 homology arm and a reverse primer (5\u2019- TACCGGTGGATGTGGAATGTG- 3\u2019) binding within the PGK promoter driving the neomycin selection. Correctly targeted clones yielded a 9.7 kb amplicon. Incorporation of the 5\u2019 loxP site, was verified by digestion of this 5\u2019 amplicon with SpeI which yielded a 7 kb and 2.7 kb cleavage products in correctly targeted clones. Both 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 screening amplicons were analysed by Sanger sequencing to confirm the junction sequence over the extremities of the homology arms using sequencing primers 5\u2019-AAAGCCCAGGGGTATCTCTC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019- CTCAGCTTGGCTATGTGGTG-3\u2019 for the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 amplicons respectively. The presence of the 5\u2019 loxP site within the 5\u2019 amplicon was confirmed by Sanger sequencing using sequencing primer 5\u2019- CATGAAGCAGTGGGCATAGA-3\u2019 and the presence of the C326Y mutation was confirmed within the 3\u2019 amplicon using sequencing primer 5\u2019-CACACACACACATATATACATGCAA-3\u2019. Southern blotting using a probe against neomycin was used to confirm that only a single integration event had occurred. Correctly recombined ES cells were injected into albino C57BL/6J blastocysts and the resulting chimeras were mated with albino C57BL/6J females. Successful germline transmission yielded black pups and F1 mice harboring the conditional C326Y knock-in allele were identified using the above screening PCR. F1 heterozygous male mice were bred with C57BL/6J Flp recombinase deleter mice (Tg(ACTB-Flpe)9205Dym (Jax stock 005703)) and offspring were screened for the deletion of the selection cassette using a forward primer (5\u2019-GATATCATCATCGCCCTTTGG- 3\u2019) binding within the 3\u2019 untranslated region of the exon 7\u20138 minigene and a reverse primer (5\u2019- TTGCATGTATATATGTGTGTGTGTG-3\u2019) binding immediately downstream of the cassette. A 1.4 kb amplicon was obtained from the Flp deleted conditional C326Y knock-in allele. Heterozygous mice without the selection cassette were then backcrossed with C57BL/6J to remove the Flp transgene prior to onward breeding."

Reviewers were reluctant to accept immunohistochemical staining as quantification of bioactive secreted hepcidin. Furthermore, iron efflux experiments need to be described in more detail. Tissue heterogeneity including the possible presence of macrophages may be an issue to resolve. Any further evidence that can be provided on the regulation of hepcidin would strengthen the paper."

The conversion of propeptide to active peptide is a step that could be regulated by iron and this may not be detected by the method used. The Methods section indicates that it was a rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse antibody from Abcam, but it does not say which antibody from Abcam was used. Several listed on Abcam's website were prepared against human peptides but have anti-mouse reactivity; one was prepared against mouse antigen and recognizes both Hamp1 and Hamp2 in mice. Are the authors certain that the antibody is recognizing the hepcidin-25 peptide encoded by Hamp1, and not something else? If they are detecting either pro-hepcidin or Hamp2 the conclusions of the paper might be very different.

The Methods section indicates that it was a rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse antibody from Abcam, but it does not say which antibody from Abcam was used. Several listed on Abcam's website were prepared against human peptides but have anti-mouse reactivity; one was prepared against mouse antigen and recognizes both Hamp1 and Hamp2 in mice.

We now include the results of those control experiments in the revised manuscript. First, we showed that staining with this antibody is absent in the heart of cardiac-specific hamp-1 knockouts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), despite Hamp-2 expression being unaltered in these hearts compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). These data demonstrate that this antibody detects HAMP1 and not HAMP2. Second, we showed that staining in the heart of wild-type animals is completely abrogated by the use of the mature peptide (hepcidin-25, Abcam ab 31875) as a blocking peptide (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In hepatocytes, it has been shown that the propeptide can also be secreted, and that this propeptide is detectable by antibodies raised against the mature peptide (Rouault and Klausner, 1997). Thus, in theory our antibody detects not only the mature secreted peptide but also the propeptide, and even demonstration of extracellular staining by immunohistochemistry would not constitute formal evidence for the presence of the active mature peptide. We do, however, provide direct evidence for the secretion of an active hepcidin by cardiomyocytes. First, in our in vitro experiments, where we detect hepcidin by ELISA in supernatants of primary cardiomyocytes from control animals (original data). We reproduced this finding in a second independent experiment (new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), and further show that hepcidin is greatly reduced or undetectable in supernatants of cardiomyocytes from cardiac Hamp-1 knockout animals. We now include these data as <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>. Second, we also provide evidence that the secreted peptide is active, and this is discussed below."

Furin is the prohormone convertase required for release of hepatic bioactive mature hepcidin peptide. In hepatocytes, it has been shown that Furin inhibition leads to decreased release of the active mature peptide and increased release of the larger inactive propetide, and that both of these protein species are detected by assays targeting the mature peptide (Rouault and Klausner, 1997). Furin is also highly expressed in the heart (Beaubien et al., 1995), raising the intriguing possibility that it may be involved in the production of the bioactive hepcidin mature peptide from cardiomyocytes. To test this hypothesis, we performed additional experiments using the Furin inhibitor Decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone trifluoroacetate salt(CMK). These experiments showed that while Furin inhibition under iron replete conditions did not decrease secreted HAMP levels (consistent with the release of the propeptide as reported in hepatocytes) (Valore and Ganz, 2008), it nonetheless increased iron export from primary cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the effect of Furin inhibitor on iron export was only seen in Hamp fl/fl and not in Hamp fl/fl Myh6.Cre+ cardiomyocytes. We include these data in <a href=\"#fig6\">Appendix 1\u2014Figure 1</a>. Together, these results provide evidence that cardiomyocytes release an active form of hepcidin in a Furin-dependent manner."

In this context, it is important to consider the mechanisms through which iron deficiency impinges on the ETC. These mechanisms include not only limiting iron availability for complex assembly and for enzymatic activity of assembled complexes, but also reducing the levels of mitochondrially-encoded proteins. Indeed, the degree of iron deficiency (and iron excess) have been shown to correlate with damage to mitochondrial DNA (Walter et al., 2002), and many of the proteins in ETC complexes are encoded by mitochondrial genes. Thus, depending on the degree of iron deficiency in the cardiomyocytes, different mechanisms may come into play, meaning that complex assembly or activity could still be disrupted when levels of individual proteins in the complex are still maintained."

For that reason it would be very helpful to know more about them, to assess their validity. Apparently, cells were loaded with non-transferrin bound 55Fe by a 30 minute incubation. How much iron was taken up under these conditions? Why was non-transferrin bound iron used instead of Fe-Tf, particularly considering the results described in Xu et al., 2015 indicating that the transferrin cycle is very important for cardiomyocyte iron uptake? What measures were undertaken to ensure that the PBS washes effectively removed non-assimilated radiolabeled iron? How many times were the experiments repeated, and how variable were the results? Why do the authors think the FpnC326Y mutant had higher iron efflux compared to Hamp-/- cardiomyocytes in the absence of Hamp?</i>"

This method does not enable measurement of absolute amounts of iron flux, but rather measurement of iron efflux as a percentage of the total iron taken up during incubation with the uptake solution; percentage efflux= 100 x Fe55 in efflux solution /(Fe55 in efflux+ Fe55 remaining in cells). The readouts are obtained using a scinitillation counter and are expressed as counts per minute. Count rate does not universally equate to dose rate, and there is no simple universal conversion factor. Any conversions are instrument-specific."

The rationale for this is to circumvent any confounding effects of differential iron uptake between cells of different genotypes due to differing levels of TfR1 expression. Indeed, we know that TfR1 expression is higher in cardiac-hepcidin knockout cells and in Slc40a1 C326Y knock-in cells than in their respective controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3O</a>). While TfR1 is the dominant route of iron uptake into cardiomyocytes, it is known that NTBI also enters cardiomyocytes via L and T-type calcium channels."

We too were initially surprised at this result. One possible explanation is that FPN levels in Slc40a1 C326Y knock-in cardiomyocytes are higher than in Hamp KOs cardiomyocytes, due to the fact that FPN in the former setting is completely insensitive to any hepcidin, while FPN in the latter may still be subject to some regulation by hepcidin from non-cardiomyocyte sources."

If this is truly physiologically important staining (see point 2 above) then it becomes even more important to understand how Hamp expression is regulated (see point 3 above). Hamp is typically measured extracellularly, rather than intracellularly because it is a secreted protein; a defect in pre-protein processing might help explain the discrepancy between panels B and C in this figure.
