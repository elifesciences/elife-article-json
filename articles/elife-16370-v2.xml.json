Although linked to several pathways including cell survival and metabolism, the molecular mechanisms underlying these outcomes are poorly understood. We identified a novel interaction of DPP9 with Filamin A, which recruits DPP9 to Syk, a central kinase in B-cell signalling. Syk signalling can be terminated by degradation, requiring the ubiquitin E3 ligase Cbl. We show that DPP9 cleaves Syk to produce a neo N-terminus with serine in position 1. Pulse-chases combined with mutagenesis studies reveal that Ser1 strongly influences Syk stability. Furthermore, DPP9 silencing reduces Cbl interaction with Syk, suggesting that DPP9 processing is a prerequisite for Syk ubiquitination. Consistently, DPP9 inhibition stabilizes Syk, thereby modulating Syk signalling. Taken together, we demonstrate DPP9 as a negative regulator of Syk and conclude that DPP9 is a novel integral aminopeptidase of the N-end rule pathway."

Although linked to several pathways including cell survival and metabolism, the molecular mechanisms underlying these outcomes are poorly understood. We identified a novel interaction of DPP9 with Filamin A, which recruits DPP9 to Syk, a central kinase in B-cell signalling. Syk signalling can be terminated by degradation, requiring the ubiquitin E3 ligase Cbl. We show that DPP9 cleaves Syk to produce a neo N-terminus with serine in position 1. Pulse-chases combined with mutagenesis studies reveal that Ser1 strongly influences Syk stability. Furthermore, DPP9 silencing reduces Cbl interaction with Syk, suggesting that DPP9 processing is a prerequisite for Syk ubiquitination. Consistently, DPP9 inhibition stabilizes Syk, thereby modulating Syk signalling. Taken together, we demonstrate DPP9 as a negative regulator of Syk and conclude that DPP9 is a novel integral aminopeptidase of the N-end rule pathway."

Around twenty different amino acids are used to make proteins, and enzymes called proteases can recognize specific pairs of amino acids in proteins and cut the bonds between them. Dipeptidylpeptidase 9 (or DPP9 for short) is a protease that removes two amino acids from the end of a protein, just as long the second amino acid is one of two specific kinds (namely, an alanine or a proline). The DPP9 protease influences a range of processes in the cell including cell death, signaling and survival. Indeed, mice born with an inactive version of DPP9 die shortly after birth, but it is not known why this happens."

This search identified a protein called Filamin A that interacted with DPP9, placing DPP9 close to Syk, which also binds to Filamin A. Further experiments showed that when DPP9 was located close to Syk, it cut the end of Syk. This cut left the Syk protein with a different amino acid exposed at its end, which in turn made it susceptible to being broken down inside the cell."

Since cleaved Syk was subsequently broken down, DPP9 acts as a shut-off mechanism for Syk after the B cell has been stimulated. The findings show that DPP9 can influence how much and how long the B cell responds to stimulation. Inhibitors of DPP9 may therefore be useful for stabilizing Syk, which is known to stop specific tumors from growing. Future work will investigate the mechanisms that control how Filamin A, DPP9 and Syk interact."

Syk is activated upon BCR engagement, and consequently initiates a cascade of events by phosphorylating its downstream effectors (<a href=\"#bib36\">M\u00f3csai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Geahlen, 2009</a>). The interaction between FLNA and Syk was identified in platelets, where loss of FLNA resulted in reduced signalling and mislocalization of Syk (<a href=\"#bib16\">Falet et al., 2010</a>). Here we show that DPP9 forms a complex with\u00a0FLNA and Syk. In this complex FLNA acts as a recruiting factor linking DPP9 to Syk, resulting in cleavage of the Syk N-terminus by DPP9, thus affecting Syk stability and Syk dependent signal transduction."

The binding surface was mapped to residues 748\u2013907 of FLNA, corresponding to FLNA repeats 5\u20137. We verified direct interaction between FLNA and DPP9 by performing pull-down assays with the recombinant proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Only background binding of DPP9 was observed in the absence of FLNA. In line with the yeast two-hybrid assay showing the importance of repeats 5\u20137, DPP9 bound to an FLNA deletion construct lacking repeats 4, 9, 12, 17, 19, 21, 23 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a> \u2018FLNA variant\u2019), which were previously mapped for several other FLNA interactions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nakamura et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yue et al., 2013</a>).

Co-immunofluorescence microscopy images taken from HeLa cells decorated with antibodies targeting DPP9 and FLNA showed an overlap in the cellular localization of these two proteins (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). Next, in situ proximity ligation assays (PLA) were performed to visualize the association of endogenous DPP9 and FLNA in cells. Notably, we detected several distinct PLA dots in HeLa cells, each dot representing a single DPP9-FLNA interaction event. The number of PLA signals in control cells silenced for FLNA was strongly reduced compared to non-silenced cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E and F</a>). Taken together, these results describe a novel and direct interaction between DPP9 and FLNA, which requires FLNA repeat 5 and is readily detected in cells."

Therefore, we tested whether DPP9 interacts with the amino terminus of Syk by conducting Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assays. Recombinant DPP9 was immobilized on a chip and probed for interaction with a synthetic Syk (1\u201331) peptide covering the first 31 amino acids of full-length Syk (MA\u2193SSGMADSANHLPFFFGNITREEAEDYLVQ). Based on published solved structures, the amino terminus of Syk includes an unstructured region followed by an \u03b1-helix (residues 22\u201331) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gr\u00e4dler et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">F\u00fctterer et al., 1998</a>). Of note, amino acids 1\u20137 are not resolved in any determined structure of Syk, suggesting that this region is flexible and thus accessible for interactions. We observed direct binding of DPP9 to the Syk (1\u201331) peptide with a K<sub>D</sub> of 52 \u00b1 4 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and E</a>), suggesting a dynamic and transient interaction. Furthermore, an inactive DPP9 variant in which the serine in the active site was mutated to a glycine residue (DPP9 S730G) showed more than a five-fold reduction in its affinity to the Syk (1\u201331) peptide (K<sub>D</sub> of 284 \u00b1 27 \u00b5M) compared to the wild type protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and E</a>). A lower affinity (K<sub>D</sub> of 156 \u00b1 60 \u00b5M) was also observed between wild type DPP9 and a Syk\u25b3MA (3\u201331) peptide, which lacks the first two amino acids Met-Ala (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and E</a>).

Previously we demonstrated that this inhibitor can be delivered into cells if it is pre-incubated with cell penetrating peptides (Pep1) to form a non-covalent Pep-1-SLRFLYEG complex. Once in cells this complex dissociates leading to inhibition of DPP9 by SLRFLYEG (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pilla et al., 2013</a>). Consistently, exposure of cells to SLRFLYEG resulted in a significant reduction in PLA signals corresponding to DPP9-Syk interaction events, compared to the control cells treated with the carrier peptide only (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>). Likewise, treatment of cells with the competitive DPP9 inhibitor 1G244 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wu et al., 2009</a>) also led to a clear decrease in the number of Syk-DPP9 PLA signals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3D and E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Of note 1G244 and all other available DPP9 inhibitors also target DPP8 due to the high conservation in the active site of both enzymes (<a href=\"#bib59\">Van Goethem et al., 2011</a>). For control, we measured the association of DPP9 with FLNA, which was not significantly altered by the 1G244 treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F and G</a>). These results demonstrate that Syk, but not FLNA, requires access to the active site of DPP9 for interaction. Taken together, we conclude that Syk is a novel DPP9 substrate."

Strikingly, immunofluorescence microscopy images show a drastic change in the cellular localization of DPP9 in FLNA silenced cells compared to control cells treated with non-targeting siRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). In particular, upon FLNA silencing, DPP9 was no longer observed at the plasma membrane and was detected less in the cytosol, showing elevated levels in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). These results demonstrate that FLNA has a strong impact on the cellular localization of DPP9. We further tested the importance of FLNA for the DPP9-Syk interaction by performing PLAs of DPP9-Syk in FLNA silenced cells, and compared to cells treated with non-targeting siRNA. We detected a significant reduction in the number of DPP9-Syk interaction events in the FLNA silenced cells as indicated by a lower number of PLA dots (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a>).

This cell line shows a 40% reduction in its capacity to cleave the artificial substrate Gly-Pro-AMC (GP-AMC), which can be cleaved by DPP8, DPP9 and DPPIV. Additionally, we detected at least a 50% reduction in DPP9 protein levels in these cells compared to the control parental cell line (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). Surprisingly, although we transfected wild type and DPP9-kd cells with equal amounts of plasmid DNA encoding C-terminal FLAG tagged Syk (Syk-FLAG), higher Syk protein levels were observed in the DPP9-kd cell line (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These unequal protein levels of the transiently transfected Syk constructs suggested that Syk may be more stable in the DPP9-kd cell line than in the wild type parental cell line. To test this hypothesis, we performed cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments of DPP9-kd and the parental cells transfected with the Syk-FLAG construct. Cells were treated with CHX to inhibit protein synthesis (\u2018pulse\u2019, time 0), and samples were taken at different time points for the chase. We found that Syk-FLAG is degraded in HeLa cells with a half-life of 6\u2009hr. Remarkably, Syk-FLAG was more stable in the DPP9-kd cells compared to the control parental HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5C and D</a>). These results suggest that processing of Syk by DPP9 and exposure of a neo Syk N-terminus with serine in position 1 (MA\u2193S) leads to Syk degradation, possibly by the N-end rule pathway."

N-end rule substrates are ubiquitinated by specific E3 ubiquitin ligases (N-Recognins) that recognize the N-degrons in proteins leading to their proteasome degradation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tasaki et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hwang et al., 2010a</a>). To test whether the serine that is exposed upon DPP9 cleavage indeed determines Syk stability, we mutated this residue to a glycine (SykS3G) or a valine (SykS3V). Following processing by DPP9 these Syk constructs would differ only in the first amino acid in their N\u2013terminus, which would be either Ser in wild type Syk, Gly or Val in the variant proteins. We chose these residues since substrates with Ser, Gly or Val in the P1\u2019 position (after the cleavage site) are processed by DPP9 with a similar efficiency (<a href=\"#bib22\">Geiss-Friedlander et al., 2009</a>). Additionally, we mutated the alanine in position 2 to an aspartic acid (SykA2D). This mutation destroys the DPP9 cleavage site, and thus should prevent Syk processing by DPP9 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Connolly et al., 2008</a>). The different Syk constructs were transfected into HeLa cells and their stability was compared by CHX chase experiments. Strikingly, the single mutation of Ser 3 to a Gly or a Val clearly increased the half-life of the SykS3G and SykS3V variants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E and F</a>), compared to the wild-type protein. Furthermore, an increased half-life of Syk was also measured for the SykA2D variant, which cannot be processed by DPP9 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G and H</a>). These results highlight the importance of Syk cleavage by DPP9 and the destabilizing effect of the serine that is exposed in the N-terminus of Syk upon cleavage."

BCR signalling was elicited by treating cells with anti-BCR F(ab)<sub>2</sub> when adding the CHX. DPP9 and Tubulin remained unaltered over the respective chase period and were assessed as a loading control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Whereas Syk was stable in unstimulated B cells over a time period of 6\u2009hr, upon stimulation of the BCR, Syk was degraded with a half-life of 2\u2009hr (+ stimulation, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Syk half-life in stimulated DG-75 cells is shorter than the previously published half-life of Syk in stimulated natural killer cells where it is estimated to be 8\u2009hr (<a href=\"#bib41\">Paolini et al., 2001</a>). As expected, a clear stabilization of Syk was observed in stimulated DG-75 cells which were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F and G</a>). Notably, consistent with our findings showing stabilization of Syk in DPP9-kd HeLa cells, treatment of stimulated DG-75 cells with the DPP8/9 inhibitor 1G244 resulted in a clear stabilization of Syk (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F and G</a>)."

CHX chase experiments on BCR stimulated cells show clear signals corresponding to the\u00a0phosphorylation of Syk on Y323 upon stimulation of DG-75 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H and I</a>), which clearly dropped in intensity over time. Notably, the intensities of signals corresponding to Syk pY323 did not drop as rapidly in 1G244 treated cells. Instead, we observed an increase in signal intensity up to 20 min post BCR stimulation, suggesting that during this time more Syk is phosphorylated on Y323, but degradation is prevented due to inhibition of DPP9. Taken together, these results show a central role for DPP9 in determining the stability of Syk after BCR-engagement, and suggest that DPP9 functions upstream of Cbl."

We therefore incubated DG-75 cells with 1G244 prior to BCR stimulation and subsequently analysed ERK1/2 phosphorylation. While BCR engagement under DPP9 inhibition revealed a more transient ERK1/2 phosphorylation profile compared to control cells, it is important to note that the levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in resting cells were slightly augmented in cells that were treated with 1G244 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7\u2009G and H</a>). These results are in line with the finding that DPP9 inhibition in unstimulated cells stabilizes an active phosphorylated form of Syk, resulting in \u2018signal leakage\u2019 as measured by higher levels of phosphorylated PLC\u03b32 forms and increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes leading to reduced sensitivity to BCR engagement.

The significance of the exposed Ser for Syk stability was demonstrated by mutagenesis of this residue to a Gly or Val, resulting in a longer half-life of these variants. Therefore, we conclude that Syk is a novel substrate of the N-end rule pathway and DPP9 a novel peptidase in this pathway (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, and see more below). Of note classical primary N-degron are positively charged or bulky hydrophobic amino acids. According to this definition, Ser, Gly and Val are not destabilizing amino acids per se (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989</a>), however they can form an N-degron upon N-terminal acetylation (Ac/N-degrons) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hwang et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Shemorry et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Park et al., 2015</a>).

Knowledge regarding the participation of aminopeptidases in the N-end rule pathway is limited to methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Varshavsky, 2011</a>). These remove a single methionine from the amino terminus of a protein substrate leaving the protein otherwise intact. Of note, cleavage by MetAPs does not directly form an N-degron, since MetAPs remove the initiator methionine from substrates where the adjacent residue (P1\u2019) is not destabilizing: Ser, Pro, Gly, Thr, Ala, Val or Cys (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Xiao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Addlagatta et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Frottin et al., 2006</a>). Nonetheless, MetAPs are considered an integral part of the N-end rule pathway, because these residues may be converted to Ac/N-degrons (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hwang et al., 2010b</a>), albeit to different efficiencies. Our data place DPP9 as a second integral aminopeptidase of the N-end rule pathway. In contrast to MetAPs, DPP9 cleavage is permissive towards more amino acids in the P1\u2019 position (Xaa-Ala/Pro-Zaa), and is only inhibited if the residue after the cleavage site (Zaa) is Pro (<a href=\"#bib22\">Geiss-Friedlander et al., 2009</a>). Therefore DPP9 may directly produce an N-degron not requiring further modification (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>).

Consequently, processing by DPP9 and MetAPs and funnelling of their products to the N-end rule pathway may be regulated by different signals. MetAP substrates, which were processed and acetylated at the N-terminus co-translationally, can be protected from degradation by masking of the N-degron, e.g. via protein interactions, and exposed upon changes in protein stoichiometry (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hwang et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Shemorry et al., 2013</a>).

The MS acquisition cycle consisted of a 500 ms TOF MS survey scan that was used for profiling of substrate and product concentrations followed by data-dependent triggering of up to five 100 ms TOF product ion spectra to confirm the identity of detected analytes. Data analysis was performed using Analyst TF 1.7 and PeakView 2.1 softwares (SCIEX). Analyses were performed in triplicates."

The search for functioning protease substrates \u2013 including DPP9 \u2013 is proceeding apace, but as the authors point out the identification of physiologically relevant substrates and partners is hampered by current limitations in technology. The authors have compiled several innovative strategies to explore a physiologic function for DPP9. They find that DPP9 regulates the levels on Syk in a FLNA-dependent manner, and the overall thrust of the paper supports a role for DPP9 in N-end rule degradation."

As suggested we cloned Syk for expression of the full-length protein in <i>E. coli,</i> as well as a shorter fragment expressing the two SH2 domains in the N-terminus of Syk fused to a C-terminal GST protein. The purified proteins were incubated with DPP9, control reactions contained Syk alone, or Syk which was incubated with an inactive DPP9 variant or in the presence of an inhibitor. Mass spectrometry analysis of these reactions revealed that the amino terminus of Syk is processed in bacteria,which remove the initiator methionine (more than 90% efficiency). Consequently, the recombinant Syk which we purified from bacteria is unfit for in vitro cleavage assays."

These data are added to <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G and H</a>, and are in agreement with results that we have already included in the manuscript: (1) PLA in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> showing that the interactions between endogenous DPP9 and Syk are reduced in cells that were treated with a DPP9 inhibitor. In this case either a competitive inhibitor (1G244) or an allosteric inhibitor (SLRFLYEG).

The fact that the amino terminus appears to be unstructured, suggests that it is highly flexible, which would strongly support the accessibility of the N-terminus into the active site of DPP9."

The calcium defects that are observed upon inhibition of DPP9 in non-stimulated cells appear to result from a mal-regulation of \u2018tonic\u2019 Syk signaling in resting cells, as seen by higher levels of phosphorylated Syk. We now complete the picture by showing that also the levels of phosphorylated PLC\u03b32 are higher upon DPP9 inhibition in resting cells, either with a competitive or with a non-competitive allosteric DPP9 inhibitor. The consequence is a lower sensitivity of the cells to BCR stimulation. This is evident by lower calcium release in stimulated cells (DG-75 and Ramos cells). Moreover, we analyzed more distal BCR events and show that inhibition of DPP9 leads to augmented \u2018tonic\u2019 and more transient BCR-induced ERK1/2 signaling, as measured by reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2."
