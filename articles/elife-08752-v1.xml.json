Studies of patients with Wolfram syndrome and carriers have identified <i>Wfs1</i> mutations as causative for MDD. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to be involved in depression and behavioral resilience, although the cell types and circuits in the mPFC that moderate depressive behaviors in response to stress have not been determined. Here, we report that deletion of <i>Wfs1</i> from layer 2/3 pyramidal cells impairs the ability of the mPFC to suppress stress-induced depressive behaviors, and results in hyperactivation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis and altered accumulation of important growth and neurotrophic factors. Our data identify superficial layer 2/3 pyramidal cells as critical for moderation of stress in the context of depressive behaviors and suggest that dysfunction in these cells may contribute to the clinical relationship between stress and depression."

Studies of patients with Wolfram syndrome and carriers have identified <i>Wfs1</i> mutations as causative for MDD. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to be involved in depression and behavioral resilience, although the cell types and circuits in the mPFC that moderate depressive behaviors in response to stress have not been determined. Here, we report that deletion of <i>Wfs1</i> from layer 2/3 pyramidal cells impairs the ability of the mPFC to suppress stress-induced depressive behaviors, and results in hyperactivation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis and altered accumulation of important growth and neurotrophic factors. Our data identify superficial layer 2/3 pyramidal cells as critical for moderation of stress in the context of depressive behaviors and suggest that dysfunction in these cells may contribute to the clinical relationship between stress and depression."

Core symptoms of MDD include lack of motivation, reduced ability to derive pleasure from natural rewards (anhedonia) and abnormalities of sleep and appetite. MDD is thought to occur as a result of combined genetic, environmental, and biological factors. Although the nature of these factors and their relative contributions to the disorder remain largely unknown, human studies (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mayberg, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hasler and Northoff, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Morishita et al., 2014</a>) and circuit-based molecular genetic analysis in mice (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nestler and Hyman, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52a\">Tye and Deisseroth, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Svenningson et al., 2006</a>) have shown that MDD is characterized by alterations in the activity of a distributed circuit controlling emotive behaviors and that treatments that act within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) can have a strong therapeutic effect (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leuchter et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>).

Depressive behaviors can be elicited in experimental animals using a variety of stressors, which typically induce alterations in neuronal morphology and synaptic function (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shansky and Morrison, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Moench and Wellman, 2014</a>) in the mPFC that are consonant with the thinning of the mPFC that occurs in MDD (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kroes et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Grieve et al., 2013</a>). Inactivation of the ventral mPFC results in loss of cortical control of stress (<a href=\"#bib5\">Diorio et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Figueiredo et al., 2003</a>) and alters the activation of brainstem neurons that regulate behavioral responses to stress (<a href=\"#bib29\">Maier, 2015</a>). Optogenetic activation of mPFC neurons projecting to the dorsal raphe nucleus can reversibly alter mobility in the forced swim test (FST), implicating this specific class of pyramidal cells in the behavioral responses to stressful situations (<a href=\"#bib56\">Warden et al., 2012</a>). While these studies clearly establish the mPFC as a structure that is important in the generation and execution of depressive behaviors and stress responses, and in the therapeutic actions of deep brain stimulation and antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, they also highlight the anatomical and functional complexities of mPFC circuitry."

Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have demonstrated that common depression is likely to result from alterations in a very large number of genes of small effect (<a href=\"#bib9\">Flint and Kendler, 2014</a>), studies of Wolfram syndrome have identified <i>Wfs1</i> as a clear example of a gene that can cause MDD in humans (<a href=\"#bib51\">Swift et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Crawford et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Swift and Swift, 2005</a>). Here, we have employed bacTRAP translational profiling and virus mediated trans-synaptic tracing studies (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wall et al., 2010</a>) to demonstrate that the Wolfram syndrome gene (<i>Wfs1</i>) is expressed in a specific population of neurotrophin 3 (<i>Ntf3</i>) and proenkephalin (<i>Penk1</i>) expressing pyramidal cells in superficial layer 2/3 of the mPFC. These cells receive projections from other cortical structures, from the posterior thalamic nuclear group, and from the lateral amygdala. Deletion of <i>Wfs1</i> in forebrain neurons of conditional knockout mice (Wfs1/CKO) alters stress-induced depression-related behaviors, induces the expression of the immediate early gene <i>Fos</i> in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and results in enhanced accumulation of serum corticosterone. Increased stress-induced depressive behavior is also evident in animals from which <i>Wfs1</i> was deleted specifically in the mPFC. <i>Wfs1</i> is present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of superficial cortical pyramidal cells, and its loss in these neurons results in altered growth factor and neurotrophin processing in response to inescapable restraint stress. Taken together, our data demonstrate that superficial layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the mPFC can play a critical role in stress-induced depressive behaviors and indicate that dysfunction of <i>Wfs1</i> in forebrain neurons leads to activation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis and elevated blood corticosterone levels. They highlight a role for superficial layer 2/3 pyramidal cells of the mPFC in the modulation of depressive behaviors and suggest that the major depression evident in patients with Wolfram syndrome and carriers may occur in part due to hyperactivation of the HPA axis in response to stress."

EGFP/L10a expression was primarily restricted to superficial layer 2/3 in the mPFC, including the prelimbic, infralimbic and medial orbitofrontal regions. Expression of EGFP/L10a was observed only in the NeuN + neurons (data not shown). Furthermore, at high magnification, it was evident that the soma of EGFP/L10a-expressing cells was pyramidal, with a clear apical dendrite (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). EGFP/L10a expression was localized to the soma, proximal dendrites, and nucleolus, as described for other bacTRAP mouse lines (<a href=\"#bib7\">Doyle et al., 2008</a>). These results confirm previous studies demonstrating laminar expression of <i>Ntf3</i> gene in the cortex (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vigers et al., 2000</a>) and identify these cells as supragranular layer 2/3 pyramidal cells."

Recent studies have demonstrated convincingly that stress can induce dendritic remodeling of the prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib39\">Radley et al., 2004</a>) and that behavioral state\u2013dependent synaptic modifications are important factors in the susceptibility and resilience to stress (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Although the precise cell populations experiencing these changes in PFC have not been determined, the expression of <i>Wfs1</i> in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells and the clinical features of Wolfram Syndrome suggested to us that these cells may be of particular importance to the relationship between stress and depression. As a first step toward investigation of this possibility, we determined the subcellular distribution of Wolframin (WFS1), the protein encoded by the <i>Wfs1</i> gene, in the PFC. Thus, a specific antiserum to WFS1 was prepared and used to characterize its distribution in the PFC. As expected, WFS1 is expressed specifically in several structures in the adult mouse brain that are relevant to stress and depression, including superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, the central extended area of the amygdala (data not shown), and pyramidal cells in the CA1 field of the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Although WFS1 is clearly co-expressed with <i>Ntf3</i> in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells of the PFC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), its expression is entirely distinct from <i>Ntf3</i> expression in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

Since <i>Wfs1</i> is expressed in many brain regions and in the periphery, we next sought to determine whether <i>Wfs1</i> expression in the forebrain contributes to the activation of the HPA axis and to the elevated corticosterone typical of animals that suffer from systemic loss of <i>Wfs1</i>. To explore this possibility, we examined the activation of HPA axis in wt and Wfs1/CKO mice after the application of ARS by cFOS immunostaining. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, ARS resulted in significantly higher levels of cFos activation in the hypothalamic PVN of Wfs1/CKO mice compared with controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>) (Two-way ANOVA\u2014Bonferroni post hoc test: WT + ARS vs CKO + ARS, p &lt; 0.001***, N = 3 per group). Since the activation of the PVN is known to stimulate the pituitary gland to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone, which in turn induces corticosterone release from adrenal glands, we examined endocrine responses to stress in Wfs1/CKO mice using radioimmunoassay (RIA). We measured serum levels of corticosterone in Wfs1/CKO and control mice under basal conditions and after 30 min of ARS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These experiments revealed that baseline corticosterone levels were not different in wt and Wfs1/CKO mice (WT: 46.17 \u00b1 5.00; CKO: 55.26 \u00b1 10.18) and that in both wt and Wfs1/CKO serum corticosterone levels increased in response to stress. However, the magnitude of the increase of serum corticosterone observed in Wfs1/CKO in response to stress (CKO + ARS: 505.12 \u00b1 7.63) was significantly greater than that seen in their wt littermates (WT + ARS: 401.50 \u00b1 6.00) (Two-way ANOVA\u2014Bonferroni post hoc test: WT + ARS vs CKO + ARS, p &lt; 0.001***, N = 5 per group). The intra-assay and inter-assay variability for the RIA were 5.08% coefficient of variation (CV) and 1.99% CV, respectively. We conclude, therefore, that loss of <i>Wfs1</i> in forebrain neurons causes hyperactivation of the PVN and the HPA axis in response to stress (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Taken together with the enhanced behavioral responses of Wfs1/CKO and Wfs1 mPFC.KO mice to ARS, these results demonstrate that normal responses to stressful stimuli require the function of <i>Wfs1</i> in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the mPFC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Given the identification of <i>Wfs1</i> as a genetic cause of MDD (<a href=\"#bib9\">Flint and Kendler, 2014</a>) and previous studies demonstrating that behavioral resilience requires normal function of the mPFC (<a href=\"#bib42\">Russo et al., 2012</a>), our data provide strong evidence that dysfunction in <i>Wfs1</i>-expressing pyramidal cells in the mPFC may contribute to MDD as a result of enhanced susceptibility to stress."

As an initial effort to map specific circuit elements, we have used two approaches to discover brain areas and cell types that connect to <i>Wfs1</i>-expressing pyramidal cells in the mPFC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). First, we have employed a cre-dependent AAV reporter virus (AAV2.EF1a.DIO.eYFP.WPRE.hGH) to map projections originating in <i>Wfs1</i> pyramidal neurons expressing CreER<sup>T2</sup> (Wfs1::CreER<sup>T2</sup>) in the mPFC. Injection ofAAV2.EF1a.DIO.eYFP.WPRE.hGH into the mPFC of Wfs1::CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice fed a tamoxifen diet results in recombination of the viral genome only in Wfs1 pyramidal cells, thus allowing identification of target sites receiving projections from these neurons. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <i>Wfs1</i>-expressing neurons in the mPFC project locally within the mPFC, and across the corpus callosum to the contralateral primary motor cortex. These neurons also project subcortically through the pyramidal tract to terminate in the caudate putamen (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Second, we have used the two-virus monosynaptic circuit tracing approach (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wall et al., 2010</a>) to identify cells that make direct, monosynaptic projections to Wfs1::CreER<sup>T2</sup> cells in the mPFC. A helper virus expressing Cre-dependent eGFP and an avian receptor protein, TVA (AAV9-pEF1a-FLEX-GT), was injected into mPFC of Wfs1:CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice, and allowed to express for 6 weeks, followed by the injection of glycoprotein deleted rabies virus expressing mCherry [(EnvA)SAD-dG-mCherry] that allows specific retrograde labeling of neurons making direct monosynaptic connections to the Wfs1 cells in mPFC.

To determine whether their processing and/or abundance changed as a consequence of loss of <i>Wfs1</i> in the PFC, Western blots for each of these proteins were processed using brain extracts collected from wt and Wfs1/CKO mice under baseline conditions and following ARS. As a comparison, we assessed the abundance of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is present in the PFC but not specifically enriched in the <i>Ntf3/Wfs1</i>-expressing cells. As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, no differences were evident in any of these proteins from wt or Wfs1/CKO animals under baseline conditions. However, in response to ARS, the abundance of WNT7A and NTF3 were both altered. WNT7A is a secreted signaling factor that is involved in axonal remodeling and synaptic differentiation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ciani et al., 2011</a>). In Wfs1/CKO animals, it is specifically decreased in the PFC (Two-way ANOVA\u2014Bonferroni post hoc test: CKO Basal vs CKO + ARS, p &lt; 0.001**, N = 3 per group) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Mature NTF3 (\u223c14 kDa) is processed from a \u223c32-kDa precursor that is referred to as proNTF3 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yano et al., 2009</a>). Although we could not reliably detect mature NTF3 on Western blots from PFC, increased levels of proNTF3 were consistently observed in Wfs1 knockout animals in response to ARS (Two-way ANOVA\u2014Bonferroni post hoc test: CKO Basal vs CKO + ARS, p &lt; 0.0001***, N = 3 per group) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

Although the cell types and circuit elements that underlie different aspects of depressive behaviors and the actions of antidepressant therapies are beginning to be identified, the impact of environmental stress on depression circuitry has not been investigated thoroughly. Here, we report that <i>Wfs1</i>, a gene that can cause depression (<a href=\"#bib9\">Flint and Kendler, 2014</a>), is co-expressed with <i>Ntf3</i>, <i>Penk</i>, and <i>Wnt7a</i> in supragranular 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the mPFC. We demonstrate that conditional deletion of Wfs1 from the forebrain in general, or from the mPFC specifically, results in the induction of depressive behaviors in response to acute stress. This is accompanied by hyperactivation of the HPA axis and elevation of serum corticosterone. We show that Wolframin (the protein encoded by <i>Wfs1</i>) is localized to the ER in these neurons and that its loss results in altered growth and trophic factor processing/secretion. Finally, we employ viral tracing methodology to determine that <i>Wfs1</i>-expressing cells in the mPFC project within the cortex and to the caudate putamen and that they receive afferent information from other cortical areas, from the amygdala and from the posterior nuclear thalamic group. We conclude that layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the mPFC are a crucial node in the circuitry regulating depressive behaviors in response to stress and that identification of mechanisms that regulate the activity of these neurons, and their downstream targets can provide important insights into the relationship between stress and depression."

Heterozygous carriers of mutant <i>Wfs1</i> alleles are also affected, exhibiting clinical features of pure MDD. It has been estimated that as many as 7% of the patients hospitalized for MDD may be predisposed due to <i>Wfs1</i> mutations (<a href=\"#bib51\">Swift et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Crawford et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Swift and Swift, 2005</a>). Studies of <i>Wfs1</i> knockout mice have shown that they replicate central and peripheral features of Wolfram syndrome and that they display impaired behavioral adaptation to stress (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sequeira et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kato et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Luuk et al., 2009</a>). Interpretation of these data with regard to brain circuitry is confounded by the complexity of the phenotypes present in <i>Wfs1</i> knockout animals and by the expression of <i>Wfs1</i> in specific subsets of neurons in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the thalamus, the amygdala, and the brainstem. Our demonstration that <i>Wfs1</i> is required for normal ER function in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the mPFC and that these cells moderate depressive behaviors in response to stress, raises two issues regarding <i>Wfs1</i>. First, given previous studies documenting an essential function for Wfs1 in pancreatic \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ishihara et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fonseca et al., 2005</a>) and the retina (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bonnet Wersinger et al., 2014</a>), and detailed biochemical studies demonstrating that WFS1 negatively regulates ER stress signaling through ATF6\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fonseca et al., 2010</a>), it seems probable that cell types expressing <i>Wfs1</i> in the brain also require its function to regulate ER stress. In the case of pancreatic \u03b2 cells, it is thought that WFS1 tightly controls ER stress to regulate insulin production in response to frequent fluctuations of blood glucose. Given these examples, the expression of <i>Wfs1</i> in selected cell types may reflect a requirement for WFS1 in regulating ER function, perhaps even secretory function, in response to extracellular signals that modulate the activity of these cell types. In this context, the observations that WNT7A and proNTF3 protein levels are altered in the cortex of Wfs1/CKO animals in response to stress may be important. Clear positive roles for WNT7A in synapse formation and maintenance have been documented in several systems (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hall et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gogolla et al., 2009</a>). In contrast to NTF3, which has an important trophic role in synapse formation, proNTF3 can induce apoptosis in cultured cells, suggesting a negative role for proNTF3 in neurons (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yano et al., 2009</a>). While it is notable that both decreased WNT7A and increased proNTF3 could result in loss of synaptic trophic support in response to stress, this is only one of many possible pathways that could be negatively impacted in layer 2/3 neurons as a consequence of Wfs1 deletion."

                                "text": "We demonstrate here that conditional deletion of <i>Wfs1</i> from the forebrain in general, or from the mPFC specifically, results in enhanced sensitivity to ARS. The data demonstrate that the PVN is hyperactivated in response to stress in these animals, and that this leads to elevated peripheral corticosterone, is interesting with regard to the connectivity of <i>Wfs1</i>-expressing neurons in the mPFC. As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <i>Wfs1</i>-expressing cells in the mPFC receive input from several adjacent cortical regions, from the BLA and from the thalamus. Taken together with the expression of the glucocorticoid, estrogen, and adrenergic receptors discussed above, these pathways provide ample opportunity for modulation of Wfs1 cells in the context of stress. Thus far, our data have demonstrated projections from <i>Wfs1</i>-expressing cells primarily to neighboring and contralateral cortical structures, and to the caudate putamen. Given the central role that striatal circuits play in both stress and depression, the simplest interpretation of our results is that loss of <i>Wfs1</i> in mPFC impairs signaling to the striatum, and that failure to stimulate GABAergic output from the NAc to the PVN (<a href=\"#bib42\">Russo et al., 2012</a>) is responsible for hyperactivation of the HPA axis in this model of stress-induced depression. Alternatively, projections from the mPFC to other subcortical sites (e.g., the amygdala) might be altered in response to Wfs1 loss in layer 2/3 neurons. It will be of interest, for example, to determine whether the activity of S100a10 corticostriatal neurons that express p11 is altered in these animals in altered in response to local circuit disruptions as a result of loss of Wfs1 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Svenningsen et al. 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>). Additional studies will be required to understand fully the properties of the mPFC circuits that are engaged by Wfs1-expressing pyramidal cells."

The data we have presented here demonstrate layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the mPFC that have been compromised or sensitized by removal of <i>Wfs1</i> exacerbate depressive behaviors in response to ARS. One interpretation of these data that is consistent with known findings is that normal function of these cells is required to moderate stress and suppress depressive behaviors. Although genetic studies indicating an association between MDD and bipolar disorder and Wfs1 have not been consistently confirmed (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ohtsuki et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Koido et al., 2005</a>), investigation of Wfs1 carriers and family members has provided strong evidence that Wfs1 mutations can lead to an increased incidence of psychiatric admissions for hospitalization (<a href=\"#bib50\">Swift et al., 1991</a>). Given the important contributions that family studies have made to our understanding of disease (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pohodich and Zoghbi, 2015</a>), we believe that further investigation of layer 2/3 cells in other models of depression, and in response to a variety of stressors, can shed important new light on pathways that operate in these cells to moderate depressive behaviors in response to stressful environments."

Mice were introduced with dust-free precision pellets (Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ) in their homecages to eliminate novelty associated with these pellets. Operant conditioning were carried out in 12 identical chambers (Med Associates, St Albans City, VT) equipped with a food magazine, house light, stimulus light, tone generator, and three nose-poke apertures. Mice were given 2 days of magazine training with variable interval 20 for time of pellet dispensal until a total of 50 reinforcers were delivered. For acquisition of instrumental learning, one of the three illuminated nose-poke apertures was designated as active (left, center, or right) in a pseudo-randomized and balanced manner for each genotype. A response in the active aperture (correct response) resulted in delivery of a food pellet, accompanied by a 3-s presentation of stimulus light above the magazine and tone. A response in the other two apertures (incorrect response) had no effect. The food reinforcers were all delivered on a variable ratio-2 schedule (1, 2 or 3 correct responses were required to obtain reinforcement). Mice were tested for 25 min each day over 12 consecutive days of training (Acquisition), and the number of correct and incorrect responses were recorded. On the 13th day, the far right or far left aperture that was previously unreinforced was now designated to be the active aperture. Reversal learning and thus behavioral flexibility was measured over the course of next 4 consecutive days."

The pool was filled with opaque water maintained at 23.5\u00b0C. Mice were shaped in the tank 1 day prior to testing using a four trial procedure in which a smaller ring (55 cm) was placed inside of the larger (97 cm) ring to decrease the total swimming area. Mice were first placed on a visible 10 \u00d7 10 cm platform for 10 s and then removed. They were then placed at three distances progressively further from the platform and allowed to swim to the platform. No data were collected during shaping. From the second day onwards, a transparent lucite platform was submerged just underneath the surface of water and placed in the same location for all trials. 6 trials were conducted per day for 4 consecutive days. Each mouse was placed in one of the four start positions, which varied for each trial, and given 120 s to find the platform in each trial. If the mouse did not find the platform within this time, then it was led to the platform where it was allowed to stay for 10 s. Each mouse was returned to its homecage during the inter-trial interval of approximately 20 min. On the seventh day, task retention was assessed by removing the platform from the pool. Throughout the trials, swim time, that is, latency to reach platform (in s), swim distance (in cm), and swim speed (in cm/s) were recorded. All data for Morris water maze were collected using EthoVision XT (Noldus, Leesburg, VA)."

Previous studies linked <i>Wfs1</i> with an increased risk for mood disorders including depression, but the cellular and molecular bases through which this gene may drive depression-related behaviors were not clear. To address these questions, the authors first profiled gene expression in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells of the mPFC using a novel bacTRAP mouse line and establish the selective expression of <i>Wfs1</i> in these neurons. Using novel conditional <i>Wfs1</i> CKO mice, they demonstrate that loss of <i>Wfs1</i> in mPFC cortical pyramidal neurons leads to depression related behaviors (immobility in the forced swim test and anhedonia) after acute restraint stress (ARS). The authors show that the CKO mice have normal baseline motor and learning behaviors and hence are selectively impaired in stress responses. The connectivity of mPFC <i>Wfs1</i>-expressing neurons was analyzed using genetically based tracing methods. They provide evidence that the CKO mice exhibit an exaggerated physiological response to ARS, consistent with hyperactivation of the HPA axis (e.g. elevated c-fos+ in hypothalamic neurons and increased serum corticosterone levels). Finally, they show that <i>Wfs1</i> CKO mice exhibit abnormal levels of two secreted proteins (WNT7A and NTF3) only upon exposure to ARS, suggesting stress-induced ER deficits. Overall, the study provides convincing evidence to demonstrate that <i>Wfs1</i> and <i>Wfs1</i>-expressing mPFC pyramidal neurons are regulators of stress responses in mice, and lends important support for a link between <i>Wfs1</i> and depression-related behaviors in model organisms and patients."

The newly developed <i>Wfs1</i> conditional KO mice will also provide an invaluable tool for future studies of other <i>Wfs1</i>-expressing neurons in regulating depression-related behaviors."
