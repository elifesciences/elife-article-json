Previous experiments revealed input-specific differences in \u03b11 and \u03b12 subunit densities in perisomatic synapses, suggesting distinct IPSC decay kinetics. However, IPSC decays evoked by axo-axonic, parvalbumin- or cholecystokinin-expressing basket cells were found to be similar. Using replica immunogold labeling, here we show that all CA1 PC somatic and AIS synapses contain the \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23 and \u03b32 subunits. In CA3 PCs, 90% of the perisomatic synapses are immunopositive for the \u03b11 subunit and all synapses are positive for the remaining five subunits. Somatic synapses form unimodal distributions based on their immunoreactivity for these subunits. The \u03b12 subunit densities in somatic synapses facing Cav2.1 (i.e. parvalbumin) or Cav2.2 (cholecystokinin) positive presynaptic active zones are comparable. We conclude that perisomatic synapses made by three distinct interneuron types have similar GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit content."

                        "text": "A salient feature of cortical microcircuits is the presence of distinct types of GABA-releasing interneurons (INs; <a href=\"#bib7\">Freund and Buzs\u00e1ki, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Somogyi and Klausberger, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ascoli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">DeFelipe et al., 2013</a>). Decades of extensive research revealed dozens of different IN types based on their developmental origin, dendritic and axonal arborization, postsynaptic targets and gene expression profiles. Recent in vivo electrophysiological, imaging and optogenetic studies demonstrated that distinct IN types play unique roles in memory formation and retrieval, network oscillations and sensory perception (<a href=\"#bib22\">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lovett-Barron et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Varga et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</a>). It is not surprising that a distal dendrite-innervating IN has a different role compared to one with axons synapsing on pyramidal cell (PC) somata. However, there are multiple types of INs that innervate the perisomatic region of PCs (axo-axonic cell (AAC), parvalbumin- (PV<sup>+</sup>) and cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK<sup>+</sup>) basket cells), yet participate in distinct network computations as inferred from their differential firing during oscillations (<a href=\"#bib20\">Klausberger et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Varga et al., 2012</a>). For example, hippocampal PV<sup>+</sup> and CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cells receive similar excitatory inputs and provide their output to the same subcellular domains of PCs (somata and proximal dendrites), but fire in different phases of theta oscillations, and only PV<sup>+</sup> cells are active during sharp wave-associated ripples (<a href=\"#bib21\">Klausberger et al., 2005</a>). To achieve this, they must utilize different molecular machinery for integrating their synaptic inputs, generating their action potential outputs and releasing GABA. An elegant example of their molecular specialization is that the release of GABA from the axon terminals of CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cells is mediated by Cav2.2 voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and is under the control of CB1 cannabinoid receptors. In contrast, the release of GABA from PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells is exclusively mediated by Cav2.1 channels and is regulated by m2 muscarinic and \u03bc opiate receptors (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib8\">Freund and Katona, 2007</a>). An even more intriguing molecular specialization was suggested based on high-resolution postembedding immunogold localization of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs). It was shown that PC somatic synapses facing PV<sup>+</sup> axon terminals contain mainly \u03b11 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Klausberger et al., 2002</a>) whereas somatic synapses opposite to CCK<sup>+</sup> boutons and AIS synapses predominantly contain GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs incorporating the \u03b12 subunit (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nusser et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fritschy et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Nyiri et al., 2001</a>). Such a presynaptic input-specific distribution of distinct postsynaptic receptor types held a great potential for the selective pharmacological manipulation of cortical networks in various psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia or anxiety; reviewed by <a href=\"#bib26\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rudolph and Mohler, 2014</a>)."

The decay time of IPSCs mediated by \u03b12 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is 3\u20134-times slower compared to that of IPSCs mediated by \u03b11 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Eyre et al., 2012</a>). These results predict that AAC and CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cell-evoked IPSCs should have decay times several fold slower compared to the ones evoked by PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells. However, this is in contrast with the rather uniform decays of fast rising (likely perisomatic) spontaneous IPSCs recorded from PCs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nusser et al., 2001</a>). Furthermore, <a href=\"#bib43\">Szabo et al. (2010)</a> provided direct evidence for the similar decays of unitary IPSCs evoked by AAC, PV<sup>+</sup> and CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cells in CA3 PCs. In addition, using genetically modified animals, <a href=\"#bib14\">Heistek et al. (2013)</a> demonstrated that fast-spiking, PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells activate \u03b12 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in CA3 PCs. It is not only these functional studies that have indicated the lack of segregation of \u03b11 and \u03b12 subunit-dominant GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to distinct somatic synapses, as two recent studies using highly sensitive immunohistochemical approaches have also shown the presence of \u03b11 and \u03b12 subunits in all perisomatic synapses without any indication of multiple synapse populations (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kasugai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Panzanelli et al., 2011</a>). However, from the presence of two unimodal distributions, a negative correlation between these two \u03b1 subunits cannot be excluded; i.e. synapses that contain many \u03b11 subunits could have few \u03b12 subunits, and vice versa. Furthermore, almost nothing is known about the quantitative relationship between different \u03b2 subunits in PC somatic and AIS synapses, although different \u03b2 subunit isoforms were shown to be responsible for the polarized distribution of recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Connolly et al., 1996</a>). Furthermore, the \u03b22 subunit has a critical role in a form of inhibitory synaptic plasticity observed at a cerebellar synapse (<a href=\"#bib13\">He et al., 2015</a>), demonstrating its crucial involvement in setting the synaptic strength."

Carbon-platinum-carbon coating of the surfaces stabilizes the phospholipids and transmembrane proteins in the replica, allowing their visualization with specific antibodies. If an antibody recognizes intracellular epitope(s), specific immunolabeling will be detected in the P-face of the membrane, whereas extracellular epitopes will be visualized on the E-face. The most widely used application of SDS-FRL is to perform quantitative comparisons between distinct subcellular compartments. However, the most straightforward interpretation of the results (i.e. twice as many gold particles reflects twice as many proteins) is based on an assumption that has not been tested: If one compartment (e.g. synapse \u2018X\u2019) contains twice as many gold particles than another one (e.g. synapse \u2018Y\u2019), the possibility that this is the consequence of a larger fraction of the protein fracturing to the appropriate membrane, and not a difference in the density of the protein, has not been excluded. For example, two synapses could have an identical receptor density, but if 80% of the synaptic receptors fractured to the P-face in synapse \u2018X\u2019, but only 40% in synapse \u2018Y\u2019, SDS-FRL would result in twice as many gold particles in the P-face of synapse \u2018X\u2019, leading to an erroneous interpretation that synapse \u2018X\u2019 has more receptors. However, at the same time, an antibody that recognizes an epitope on the opposite side (E-face) would label the synapse \u2018Y\u2019 with 3-times as many gold particles as synapse \u2018X\u2019 (60% versus 20%), resulting in a negative correlation between the labels obtained in E- and P-faces."

Somatic P-face membrane areas with high intramembrane particle (IMP) densities contained a large number of gold particles labeled with an anti-\u03b32<sub>(Rb; aa319-366)</sub> antibody. The complementary E-face membranes also contained many gold particles labeled with an anti-\u03b32 antibody recognizing an extracellular epitope (\u03b32<sub>(Rb; aa39-67)</sub>). Gold particle numbers on both faces strongly and significantly correlated with the synaptic areas (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), consistent with the results of many previous studies. Importantly, we found a strong positive correlation between P- and E-face gold particle numbers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), demonstrating that GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs fracture to both faces of the plasma membrane and the synapse-to-synapse variability in gold particle number is not the consequence of synapse-to-synapse variability in fracturing to E- and P-faces. Thus, for proteins where antibodies against both intra- and extracellular epitopes are not available (i.e. the vast majority of proteins), quantitative comparisons between different subcellular compartments can be reliably made with a single antibody."

In contrast, fractured plasma membranes of AISs cannot be recognized based on their position within the replicas or on morphological criteria, requiring their molecular identification. Thus, throughout the study, we used immunoreactions for Nav1.6 or Kv1.1 subunits and defined a membrane as an AIS if it was either Nav1.6 or Kv1.1 immunopositive (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lorincz and Nusser, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kirizs et al., 2014</a>). To avoid complications arising from potential competition between different antibodies on the same replica, the mirror replica method was used for the co-localization of the \u03b32 subunit and neuroligin-2 (NL-2), a GABAergic synapse-specific cell adhesion molecule (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). Immunogold particles for NL-2 were clustered over small areas of somatic and AIS P-face membranes that contained a high density of IMPs, characteristic of GABAergic synapses (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kasugai et al., 2010</a>). The complementary E-face membrane areas always contained many gold particles labeling for the \u03b32 subunit (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3A\u2013D</a>). When the \u03b32 subunit-immunoreacted replica was searched and somatic and AIS areas with strong \u03b32 subunit labeling were found, the corresponding areas on the opposite replica were always immunopositive for NL-2. The distributions of somatic and AIS synapses of both CA3 and CA1 PCs are unimodal based on their NL-2 and \u03b32 subunit content (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2H,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3H,I</a>), indicating the lack of multiple synapse populations. The number of gold particles for both NL-2 and the \u03b32 subunit in AIS and somatic synapses shows a positive correlation with the synaptic area (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3E,F</a>), demonstrating that the main source of variability in the postsynaptic receptor number is the variance in the synaptic area. There was large variability in the area of AIS and somatic synapses (CA3 AIS: CV = 0.6, n = 161; CA1 AIS: CV = 0.4, n = 164; CA3 soma: CV = 0.7, n = 1105; CA1 soma: CV = 0.7, n = 767). Statistical comparisons of the four compartments revealed that CA1 AIS synapses are significantly smaller than CA1 somatic and CA3 AIS synapses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a>). Finally, we found positive correlations between the number of gold particles for the \u03b32 subunit and NL-2 in individual AIS and somatic synapses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2G</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3G</a>). Comparisons of NL-2 densities between CA3 and CA1 PC AIS and somatic synapses showed no significant differences (for normalization see Materials and methods; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). In contrast, we found that normalized \u03b32 subunit densities were significantly higher in CA3 and CA1 AIS synapses than in somatic synapses of both regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). These results demonstrate that all GABAergic synapses on the soma and AIS of both CA1 and CA3 PCs contain the \u03b32 subunit and NL-2, enabling their use as GABAergic synapse-specific markers."

First, we carried out face-matched mirror replica labeling for NL-2 and the \u03b11 subunit (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Replicas immunoreacted for Nav1.6 and NL-2 were first screened and when a NL-2-positive GABAergic synapse was found on P-face somatic or AIS membranes, its corresponding E-face membrane was photographed and the \u03b11 subunit content was quantitatively analyzed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). This sampling method resulted in an unbiased synapse population and revealed that all somatic and AIS synapses are immunopositive for the \u03b11 subunit on CA1 PCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>), but that ~10% of CA3 PC synapses are immunonegative for the \u03b11 subunit (AIS: 4 out of 50; soma: 44 out of 402; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). The density of the \u03b11 subunit was twice as high in CA1 compared to CA3 perisomatic synapses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Immunonegative synapses on CA3 PCs either lack the \u03b11 subunit or contain it at a low density that falls below the detection threshold of our method. However, the fact that &gt;99% of synapses in CA1 PCs are immunopositive, where the \u03b11 density is higher, suggests that the latter possibility might be more likely."

We obtained antibodies that provided specific immunolabeling against all \u03b2 subunit isoforms (\u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23) and co-localized them with the \u03b32 subunit in face-matched mirror replicas.

Tissue prepared from very mildly-fixed rat brains showed robust and punctate immunolabeling for both NL-2 and the \u03b32 subunit in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a> illustrates reactions in the CA3 region). Strongly immunoreactive puncta surrounded PC somata and ankyrin-G-labeled AISs. Qualitative evaluation of our reactions revealed that apparently all clusters were immunopositive for both NL-2 and the \u03b32 subunit, consistent with our SDS-FRL results. AISs were strongly and dominantly demarcated by immunoreactive puncta for both of these molecules, allowing their use for identifying AISs. Co-localization of the \u03b11 and \u03b32 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>) and \u03b12 and \u03b32 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>) subunits revealed that both PC somata and AISs are surrounded by relatively weak immunopositive puncta for the \u03b11 subunit and much stronger puncta for the \u03b12 subunit. We noted that despite the very robust demarcation of PC AISs by \u03b12 subunit-immunopositive clusters, all perisomatic synapses were also labeled for the \u03b12 subunit. Antibodies against the \u03b21, \u03b22 and \u03b23 subunits in low-pH fixed tissue visualized strongly immunopositive clusters that delineated the AISs and surrounded the somata of PCs (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D\u2013F</a>). These clusters were extensively co-localized with the \u03b32 subunit or NL-2, indicating their synaptic nature. Immunofluorescent labeling of the six major GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits with a low-pH-based fixation protocol revealed the presence of \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23, and \u03b32 subunits in virtually all AIS and somatic synapses of the CA3 region, consistent with the EM SDS-FRL results.

In agreement with our ultrastructural data, LM immunofluorescent localization of the six GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits in low-pH-fixed tissue also revealed that all examined subunits form clusters around PC somata and delineate the AISs. This is consistent with the results of <a href=\"#bib38\">Panzanelli et al. (2011)</a> showing the presence of \u03b11 and \u03b12 subunits in both AIS and somatic synapses. However, the presence of every examined subunit in both somatic and AIS synapses does not mean that all synapses contain these subunits at the same density. The relative abundance of a synaptic receptor cannot be easily determined using diffraction-limited LM, and therefore we refrained from quantitative analysis of our fluorescent reactions. In contrast, the SDS-FRL allows the direct quantitative comparison of surface densities between different subcellular compartments. Our quantitative results revealed very similar densities of NL-2 and \u03b11 subunit in somatic and AIS synapses of both CA3 and CA1 regions, but higher \u03b12 and \u03b32 subunit densities in AIS compared to somatic synapses of CA1 PCs."

Prominent demarcation of AISs with \u03b12 subunit-immunopositive clusters is found in many brain regions, including the CA3 area of the hippocampus and in layer 2/3 and 5 PCs of several cortical areas. The demarcation of the AISs in a fluorescent reaction is the consequence of the density of GABAergic synapses on AISs; the larger the synapse density is, the more delineated the AISs will appear. In addition, the strength of a fluorescent synaptic cluster is determined by the density of the receptors and the size of the synapse. The fact that CA3 AISs appear strongly demarcated for the \u03b12 subunit, which has similar densities in somatic and AIS synapses, indicates that the larger synaptic size and the large synaptic coverage of AISs are primarily responsible for their apparent predominance for \u03b12 subunit labeling. Our results presented here also show that the prominent demarcation of CA3 PC AISs is not a unique feature of the \u03b12 subunit, but is also evident for NL-2, \u03b21, \u03b23 and \u03b32 subunits."

The proposed segregation of \u03b11 and \u03b12 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to synapses established by PV<sup>+</sup> and CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cells, respectively, comprises one of the most remarkable molecular specializations of synapses that are within the same subcellular compartment separated by only a few microns (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nyiri et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Klausberger et al., 2002</a>). Such a segregation would imply different decay kinetics to the IPSCs, which were not seen using paired recordings between identified basket cells and CA3 PCs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Szabo et al., 2010</a>). Using transgenic animals with a point mutation rendering the \u03b12 subunit insensitive to benzodiazepines, <a href=\"#bib14\">Heistek et al.

These results, taken together with our quantitative EM data showing similar \u03b12 subunit densities in the two basket cell synapse populations, point towards a similar subunit composition of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in these functionally distinct somatic synapse populations."

A study from our laboratory demonstrated that external tufted cells of the main olfactory bulb express the \u03b11 and \u03b13 subunits and display small synapse-to-synapse, but large cell-to-cell variability in the \u03b11:\u03b13 ratio (<a href=\"#bib6\">Eyre et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with this, the decay kinetics of IPSCs recorded from tufted cells have small within-cell, but large cell-to-cell variability. Here, we found that hippocampal PCs exhibit moderate synapse-to-synapse, but small cell-to-cell variability in the \u03b11:\u03b12. This is in agreement with the very small cell-to-cell variability in mIPSC decay times recorded from PCs. Thus, our analysis of the ratios of two \u03b1 subunits in two cell types demonstrate that distinct neuronal types use unique strategies for expressing multiple synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b1 subunit isoforms with either a variable or constant ratio from synapse-to-synapse and cell-to-cell, allowing them to fulfill individual cellular requirements in network dynamics."

The highest labeling efficiency of the postembedding immunogold method for AMPA and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs localization was estimated to be around 30\u201340% (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nusser et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">1998</a>), but it could be as high as 90\u2013100% with SDS-FRL (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tanaka et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lorincz and Nusser, 2010</a>). The density of functional GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs was estimated to be ~1200 receptors per \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> in cerebellar stellate cell synapses (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nusser et al., 1997</a>). Our face-matched mirror replica labeling for the \u03b32 subunit revealed around 800 gold / \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> on the E- and 250 gold / \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> on the P-face, resulting in ~1050 gold in every \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> of postsynaptic membrane. If a similar GABA<sub>A</sub>R density characterizes hippocampal perisomatic synapses to that found in cerebellar stellate cells, an almost 90% labeling efficiency can be calculated in our best reactions. Thus, SDS-FRL has a superior sensitivity compared to postembedding labeling, the only other localization technique that allows the visualization of receptors and ion channels embedded in dense protein matrices found in e.g. postsynaptic membranes or AISs. Increasing the sensitivity of a localization method results in the disappearance of negative synapses if their negativity was the consequence of a low protein content and not the lack of the protein. It is important to emphasize that even with SDS-FRL, some of the synapses could remain immunonegative (e.g. some of the CA3 PC perisomatic synapses were apparently negative for the \u03b11 subunit) and it is erroneous to conclude that their negativity means the lack of the examined protein just because this technique with certain antibodies yields a labeling efficiency close to 100%. The fact that &gt;99% of synapses are immunopositive in CA1 PCs, where the overall density of the \u03b11 subunit is &gt;2 fold larger than in CA3 PCs, indicates that the 10% immunonegativity of the CA3 synapses is probably due to low subunit densities and not the lack of the subunit. Concluding the lack of a protein in a subcellular compartment with any immunolocalization technique requires a labeling efficiency close to 100% and this needs to be determined for each antibody."

The \u03b12 content of the two synapse populations was assessed in partially fractured postsynaptic membranes facing Cav2.1-positive (Cav2.1<sup>+</sup>, i.e. PV<sup>+</sup>) or Cav2.2-positive (Cav2.2<sup>+,</sup>i.e. CCK<sup>+</sup>) active zones (AZs). All other GABA<sub>A</sub>R density measurements were performed on synapses fractured in their entirety."

The reaction intensities varied between individual animals, probably due to differences in fixation. Therefore, in order to pool the synaptic density values for statistical comparisons, each density value was normalized to the reaction average, which was calculated by averaging density values for AIS and somatic synapses in both CA3 and CA1 areas. Normalized density values for NL-2, \u03b32, \u03b11 and \u03b12 subunits are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2H,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3H\u2013K</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4G\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5G\u2013I</a>. Raw density values are shown whenever quantification was made only in one rat (immunogold labeling for \u03b2 subunits), or when the reactions were not different between rats, and hence they could be pooled for statistical comparisons (i.e. \u03b12 density measurement in identified synapses, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>; p&gt;0.0125, after Bonferroni correction following Mann-Whitney tests for pair-wise comparison of \u03b12 density values in four compartments for two rats: identified (Cav2.1<sup>+</sup> and Cav2.2<sup>+</sup>) and unidentified synapses, and E-face background labeling). The \u03b11 versus \u03b12 density ratios (\u03b11:\u03b12) were calculated by dividing normalized \u03b11 and \u03b12 density values of individual synapses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>)."

Similar labeling patterns were obtained with a rabbit anti-\u03b11 (\u03b11<sub>(Rb; aa1-9)</sub>) and a mouse anti-\u03b11 (\u03b11<sub>(Mo; aa28-43)</sub>) antibody, indicating the specificity of the reaction. Mirror replica labeling was used to assess the specificity of our \u03b12 and \u03b32 labeling, by using antibodies directed against an extracellular and an intracellular epitope. We observe similar gold particle labeling patterns with a rabbit anti-\u03b12 antibody (\u03b12<sub>(Rb; aa322-357)</sub>) on the P-face compared to that obtained with a guinea-pig anti-\u03b12 antibody (\u03b12<sub>(Gp; aa1-9)</sub>) on the E-face. Our \u03b32 labeling on the E-face, obtained with a rabbit antibody (\u03b32<sub>(Rb, aa39-67)</sub>), was very similar to the immunogold labeling seen on the P-face with a rabbit anti-\u03b32 antibody (\u03b32<sub>(Rb, aa319-366)</sub>), recognizing an intracellular epitope (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D</a>). We could not purchase anti-\u03b2 subunit antibodies raised against different epitopes, and therefore we could not test the specificity of the labeling using two antibodies. However, we performed SDS-FRL immunogold labeling for the \u03b21 and \u03b22 subunits in brain areas and nerve cells where the genes of these subunits are not expressed (e.g. cerebellar Purkinje cells, and medial habenula neurons), and observe very few gold particles labeling for \u03b21 or \u03b22 subunits in GABAergic synapses (zero or 1\u20133 gold particles / synapse; data not shown). These results indicate that our immunogold labeling for the \u03b21 (\u03b21<sub>(Gp; aa342-430)</sub>) and \u03b22 (\u03b22<sub>(Gp; aa343-430)</sub>) subunits in hippocampal perisomatic synapses is probably due to specific antibody-protein interactions. We observed a similar labeling pattern with our guinea-pig anti-\u03b23 antibody (\u03b23<sub>(Gp; aa344-429)</sub>) to that published by <a href=\"#bib15\">Kasugai et al. (2010)</a> with a different antibody against the \u03b23 subunit, the specificity of which was proven in \u03b23<sup>-/-</sup> mice."
