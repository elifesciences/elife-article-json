Combining psychophysics measurements and driving simulation, we confirm that speed is underestimated when contrast is reduced uniformly for all objects of the visual scene independently of their distance from the viewer. However, we show that when contrast is reduced more for distant objects, as is the case in real fog, visual speed is actually overestimated, prompting drivers to decelerate. Using an artificial anti-fog\u2014that is, fog characterized by better visibility for distant than for close objects, we demonstrate for the first time that perceived speed depends on the spatial distribution of contrast over the visual scene rather than the global level of contrast per se. Our results cast new light on how reduced visibility conditions affect perceived speed, providing important insight into the human visual system."

Combining psychophysics measurements and driving simulation, we confirm that speed is underestimated when contrast is reduced uniformly for all objects of the visual scene independently of their distance from the viewer. However, we show that when contrast is reduced more for distant objects, as is the case in real fog, visual speed is actually overestimated, prompting drivers to decelerate. Using an artificial anti-fog\u2014that is, fog characterized by better visibility for distant than for close objects, we demonstrate for the first time that perceived speed depends on the spatial distribution of contrast over the visual scene rather than the global level of contrast per se. Our results cast new light on how reduced visibility conditions affect perceived speed, providing important insight into the human visual system."

Notably, it has been shown that people tend to underestimate speeds when visibility is reduced equally at all distances, as for example, when driving with a fogged up windshield. But what happens when the visibility decreases as you look further into the distance, as happens when driving in fog? Fortunately, as new research reveals, people tend to overestimate their speed when driving in fog-like conditions, and show a natural tendency to drive at a slower pace."

In one experiment, drivers were presented with two driving scenes and asked to guess which scene was moving faster. In the reference scene, the car was driving at a fixed speed through a landscape under conditions of clear visibility; in the test scene, it was moving through the same landscape, again at a fixed speed, but with the visibility reduced in different ways. The experiments showed that drivers overestimated speeds in fog-like conditions, and they underestimated speeds when the reduction in visibility did not depend on distance. Further experiments confirmed that these perceptions had an influence on driving behaviour: drivers recorded an average speed of 85.1 km/hr when the visibility was good, and this dropped to 70.9 km/hr in severe fog. However, when visibility was reduced equally at all distances, as happens with a fogged up windshield, the average driving speed increased to 101.3 km/hr."

When looking directly into the fog, visibility is strongly reduced in the distant regions, where the relative motion is slow, and is preserved in the near regions, where the motion is fast. This visibility gradient would lead to speed overestimation. To test this theory, the experiments were repeated with new drivers under three different conditions: good visibility, fog, and an artificial situation called \u2018anti-fog\u2019 in which visibility is poor in the near regions and improves as the driver looks further into the distance.

While uniform contrast reduction is a valid model to assess the perception of two-dimensional patterns moving on a computer screen, it is a poor model to investigate how an atmospheric phenomenon like fog affects motion perception in three-dimensional environments. Specifically, fog alters visual contrast because tiny water droplets suspended in the air are interposed between the observer and the surrounding objects. The quantity of droplets increases along the line-of-sight as distance from the observer increases. As a consequence, the contrast of the visual scene decreases with distance, and visibility is better for close than for distant objects. Therefore, the distance-dependent attenuation of contrast experienced in fog is obviously very different from the uniform reduction traditionally adopted in vision research. Uniform contrast reduction resembles more closely what one could experience when looking at the environment through a dirty glass or a foggy windshield."

This method allowed us to determine the point of subjective equality (PSE) as well as the just-noticeable difference (JND). The PSE corresponded to the speed at which the two scenes were perceived as moving equally fast. Therefore, PSEs higher than the actual speed of the reference scene indicated speed underestimation, whereas PSEs lower than the speed of the reference scene indicated speed overestimation. The JND corresponded to the smallest detectable difference between two different speeds.

This suggests that the global level of contrast is not the only factor affecting perceived speed. The spatial distribution of contrast over the visual scene also seems to play a critical role.

In this situation, fog acts as a mask obscuring the central region of the visual field. Recently, we have shown that speed perception strongly depends on the visible portion of the visual field (<a href=\"#bib19\">Pretto et al., 2009</a>). In particular, we found that speed is overestimated when the central area is occluded, and underestimated when it is the peripheral area that is masked. A similar phenomenon could explain why speed is overestimated in fog, that is, when contrast is reduced in a distance-dependent manner. More specifically, speed overestimation in fog could result from the relative contrast between the central and peripheral areas of the visual field."

In other words, normal fog and anti-fog resulted in opposite spatial distributions of contrast over the visual scene, although the global contrast reduction was the same for both fog types.

This indicates that estimating driving speed was more difficult in the anti-fog condition, which likely results from the completely artificial nature of this type of contrast reduction. Indeed, anti-fog is a type of contrast alteration that never occurs in real life. In that respect, it is interesting to mention that reduced speed discrimination performance was observed with both unusual types of contrast reduction, namely anti-fog here and uniform contrast reduction in the first experiment."

These studies were directly inspired by classical vision research experiments that assessed the effect of contrast on the perceived speed of two-dimensional objects on a monitor (<a href=\"#bib27\">Thompson, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Stone and Thompson, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Blakemore and Snowden, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Anstis, 2003</a>). In the present study, we reproduced this perceptual bias, showing that visual speed is indeed underestimated when contrast is reduced in a distance-independent manner. However, we show that this is only part of the whole picture. In particular, we demonstrate here for the first time that an identical global loss of visibility can evoke opposite percepts, depending on the nature of the underlying visual contrast reduction. Therefore, contrarily to what has been consistently reported in previous studies, a global contrast reduction can also lead to an overestimation of visual speed. This is notably the case when contrast is not reduced uniformly for all objects of the visual scene but varies according to their distance from the viewer. For instance, in fog, contrast reduction is more important for distant than for close objects. This generates a distance-dependent visibility gradient between the peripheral and central area of the visual field. Our results show that in this situation, perceived speed is not determined by the global level of contrast per se, but rather by the spatial distribution of contrast over the visual scene. More specifically, perceived speed is determined by the relative contrast between the central and peripheral areas of the visual field. When visibility is better in the peripheral than in the central visual field, as is the case in fog, speed is overestimated. Inverting the direction of the contrast gradient with anti-fog and thereby obscuring more the peripheral than the central region of the visual field, inverts the perceptual bias such that speed is now underestimated. This highlights the critical role of the visibility gradient in perceived speed, explaining why speed is unexpectedly overestimated in fog despite a global reduction of visibility. Importantly, our results also evidence the direct relationship between perceived and produced speed. Specifically, speed overestimation systematically prompted drivers to drive slower, whereas speed underestimation led to faster driving paces. This demonstrates that driving speed is strongly affected by perceived visual speed."

                        "text": "In \u2018real-life\u2019 driving, the roadsides usually include various objects and landmarks as trees, buildings, traffic signs, or pedestrians. Such objects next to the road can have a cognitive influence on driving speed because they constitute potential obstacles that increase the risk of collision (e.g., tree or building if one drives out of the road and cars or pedestrians suddenly crossing the road). However, we were interested in the perceptual and not in the cognitive effects of contrast reduction on driving speed. Therefore, the roadsides of our driving scenario consisted of a grass texture clear of any object and landmark. This prevented cognitive factors as those mentioned above to bias our results, but importantly, it also prevented subjects of using these landmarks to estimate moving speed. Indeed, adding landmarks or other \u2018higher-level\u2019 cues would have given the subjects the possibility to use some cognitive strategies to estimate speed. For instance, subjects could have used relative size information of landmarks to infer distances and counted passing them to assess speed. Undoubtedly, this would have biased our results. Yet, one could argue that at a \u2018pure\u2019 perceptual level, objects next to the road can also contribute to increase peripheral visual flow, thereby altering perceived speed. This would be mostly true with a driving environment that provides only little visual flow information (e.g., very smooth road pavement and roadsides). However, the scene we used consisted of a rough asphalt pavement and roughly textured grass roadsides (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). These rough textures provided participants with rich visual flow information when driving, as attested by our results. Specifically, in the \u2018clear visibility\u2019 condition, participants estimated visual speed with great accuracy. In addition, the variability of speed estimates was small (i.e., low JNDs) in all conditions, and even more with clear visibility. Those elements indicate that our driving scenario provided robust visual flow information allowing for reliable speed estimates."

                        "text": "Contrast-dependent modulation of neural activity has been reported at early stages of visual processing, as the retina (<a href=\"#bib21\">Shapley and Victor, 1978</a>), the lateral geniculate nucleus (<a href=\"#bib24\">Solomon et al., 2002</a>), and the primary visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Levitt and Lund, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Polat et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Sceniak et al., 1999</a>). It has also been reported in the middle temporal area (MT or V5), an area playing an important role in motion processing (<a href=\"#bib17\">Pack et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bartels et al., 2008</a>) and speed detection (<a href=\"#bib15\">Maunsell and Van Essen, 1983b</a>), notably via feedforward projections to the medial superior temporal area (<a href=\"#bib14\">Maunsell and van Essen, 1983a</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ungerleider and Desimone, 1986</a>). Yet, linking these neurophysiological findings with the effect of contrast on perceived speed in humans is not straightforward. For instance, the observation that MT neurons tuned to high speeds are strongly activated by slow stimuli at low contrast (<a href=\"#bib17\">Pack et al., 2005</a>) would predict speed overestimation at low contrast. This is the opposite of what has been usually observed with uniform contrast reduction, including in the current study. As stated by <a href=\"#bib17\">Pack et al. (2005)</a>, this inconsistency might be resolved by assuming a bias towards slow speeds when the total MT population activity is low. Such a bias towards slow speed is precisely what is proposed by Bayesian models of speed perception (<a href=\"#bib30\">Weiss et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Stocker and Simoncelli, 2006</a>). Specifically, these models rely on the assumption that speed \u2018measurements\u2019 are intrinsically noisy, and that based on our everyday experience, slower motions are more likely to occur than faster ones\u2014resulting in an elevated prior for slow speeds. Whereas Bayesian models of speed perception can accurately predict speed underestimation at low contrast (<a href=\"#bib25\">Stocker and Simoncelli, 2006</a>), speed overestimation observed at higher speeds (<a href=\"#bib28\">Thompson et al., 2006</a>) and at low luminance (<a href=\"#bib7\">Hammett et al., 2007</a>) are more difficult to account for. Alternative models have proposed that speed is encoded as \u2018the ratio of the responses of physiologically plausible temporal filters\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Hammett et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Hammett et al., 2005</a>). These \u2018ratio models\u2019 account for both under- and overestimation of speed at low contrast (<a href=\"#bib28\">Thompson et al., 2006</a>). However, none of the abovementioned models addressed situations in which the amount of contrast reduction differed for different areas of the moving visual scene, as is the case when driving in fog. In that respect, these models do not explain the differences in speed perception observed here with uniform and distance-dependent contrast reduction. They do not account for opposite biases evoked with the same global contrast reduction at the same actual speed."

We show here for the first time how fog biases speed perception, and we reveal the perceptual mechanisms underlying this bias, providing important insights into the human visual system. In particular, we show that contrarily to what was previously believed, speed is overestimated in fog because visibility is poorer in the central than in the peripheral area of the visual field. We also show that the behavioural consequence of this speed overestimation is a natural tendency to drive at a slower pace. Therefore, drivers should probably listen to their visual system when it prompts them to decelerate."

For all experiments, the participants were seated in a simplified vehicle mock-up equipped with steering wheel and pedals. The steering wheel haptic feedback was disabled so that no speed information could be inferred from the wheel feedback. Also, the steering wheel rotation amplitude was linearly mapped to the vehicle turning speed and applied on the centre of mass of the vehicle. This way, a small rotation of the steering wheel resulted in a slow rotation of the vehicle around its vertical axis, whereas a large steering wheel rotation led to a fast turning, independently of the actual longitudinal speed of the vehicle. The mock-up was located at the centre of a large semi-spherical screen equipped with a multi-projection system. The panoramic screen surrounded the observer to provide an image that embraces almost the entire human visual field. More specifically, a cylindrical screen with a curved extension onto the floor provided a projection surface of 230\u00b0 (horizontally) \u00d7 125\u00b0 (vertically). The resulting surface was entirely covered by four LCD projectors, with a resolution of 1400 \u00d7 1050 pixels each. Overlapping regions were blended by openWARP technology (Eyevis, Reutlingen, Germany). The geometry of the scene was adjusted for an eye height of 0.8 m at a distance of 3 m from the vertical screen. The virtual environment was created using 3DVIA Virtools 4.1 (Dassault Systemes, V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France) behavioural engine, which was running distributed on a 5-PCs cluster, one for each of the projectors and a supervisor. The visual stimulus consisted of a virtual environment where a textured plane reproducing a straight single-lane road was scrolled at different speeds. The central surface of the plane was a rough asphalt pavement, whereas the sides were covered with grass-like textures. The sky consisted of a homogenous grey texture with the same colour of the fog and the plane used for the uniform contrast reduction (RGB = [128, 128, 128])."

The colour of each pixel was converted into the corresponding brightness (the arithmetic mean of the red, green, and blue colour coordinates in the RGB colour space), and the scene luminance distribution was computed based on the empirically determined function between luminance and brightness. The function was determined in two phases: (i) a plane model with uniform colour (brightness) was displayed on the screen facing the observer, and luminance was measured on its surface with a Minolta LS-100 photometer (Konica Minolta, Tokyo, Japan) for several brightness levels; (ii) the readings of the photometer were plotted against the corresponding brightness and fitted (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.999) by a quadratic function that was then used to compute the luminance distribution of the scene for each visibility condition. The contrast of the scene was then computed as the RMS of the luminance (in cd/m<sup>2</sup>) of the pixels in the virtual scene (similarly to what <a href=\"#bib23\">Snowden et al., 1998</a> did in their work). We set the fog density value to 0.1 for the medium visibility condition and 0.3 for the poor condition, in a range from 0 (full visibility) to 1 (no visibility).

This way, a small rotation of the steering wheel resulted in a slow rotation of the vehicle around its vertical axis, while a large steering wheel rotation led to a fast turning, independently of the actual longitudinal speed of the vehicle."
