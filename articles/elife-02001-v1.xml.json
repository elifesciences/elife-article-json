Thus, a mutagenic effect of their repair could constitute a serious genetic burden. We show here that while mismatches introduced into human cells on an SV40-based episome were invariably repaired, this process induced mutations in flanking DNA at a significantly higher rate than no mismatch controls. Most mutations involved the C of TpC, the substrate of some single strand-specific APOBEC cytidine deaminases, similar to the mutations that can typify the \u2018mutator phenotype\u2019 of numerous tumors. siRNA knockdowns and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that TpC preferring APOBECs mediate the mutagenesis, and siRNA knockdowns showed that both the base excision and mismatch repair pathways are involved. That naturally occurring mispairs can be converted to mutators, represents an heretofore unsuspected source of genetic changes that could underlie disease, aging, and evolutionary change."

One of these involves processing U/G mismatches, or BER products thereof, by a non-canonical application of the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Normally, MMR (<a href=\"#bib45\">Modrich, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hsieh and Yamane, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jiricny, 2013</a>) is a high fidelity process that operates post-replicatively on the nascent DNA strand to remove mismatches that have escaped the proof-reading activity of high fidelity replicative DNA polymerases. Essential components of this pathway include the heterodimer MutS\u03b1 (MSH2 and MSH6), which recognizes mismatches, the heterodimer MutL\u03b1 (MLH1 and PMS2), which accesses the mismatch-containing nascent strand in a reaction mediated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, a multipurpose replication clamp, e.g., <a href=\"#bib46\">Moldovan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lee and Myung, 2008</a>).

Thus, MMR is subverted to an error-prone process that contributes to SHM. Recently, elements of non-canonical MMR have been recapitulated in vitro (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schanz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pe\u00f1a-Diaz et al., 2012</a>), and the latter study also showed that extracts of non-lymphoid mammalian cells can also process U/G mismatches by a non-canonical MMR process. In addition, these non-lymphoid cells when stressed in vivo by the alkylating agent, N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), generated more mutations in MMR proficient than deficient cells, thereby implicating MMR in the mutagenic process but presumably using an AID-independent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hsieh, 2012</a>)."

Of interest in this regard is the mechanism that produces the enhanced mutation rate that characterizes certain tumors, which has been termed the \u2018mutator phenotype\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bielas et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Venkatesan et al., 2006</a>). Recent examples of such a mutator phenotype are the high mutation rates of the C of TpCpN (or its complement, G of NpGpA) that can accompany the progression of some cancers (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Roberts et al., 2012</a>). TpC-preferring members of the AID/APOBEC family of C deaminases, particularly APOBEC3B (A3B), mediate these mutations (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burns et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Leonard et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Roberts et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Taylor et al., 2013</a>), which can occur in strand-coordinated clusters. These deaminases prefer single stranded DNA and an important issue is how the single stranded APOBEC substrate is generated. Experiments using yeast as a model system showed that the transitory single stranded regions that arise at replication forks or during double strand break repair can accumulate such mutations upon chronic alkylation of DNA (<a href=\"#bib59\">Roberts et al., 2012</a>).

Numerous studies have shown that processing lesions harbored by such episomes (as well as those introduced in the SV40 virion) faithfully captured the DNA repair repertoire and mutational environment of its host (e.g., <a href=\"#bib25\">Hare and Taylor, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Seidman et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brown and Jiricny, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Choi and Pfeifer, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Terai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pathania et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Qi et al., 2012</a>).

HmU is a byproduct of the enzymatic demethylation of methyl-C (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bhutani et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Guo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wu and Zhang, 2014</a>) and abasic sites are generated during BER (e.g., <a href=\"#bib61\">Robertson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Jacobs and Schar, 2012</a>). For convenience, we refer to both mismatches and ab/G sites as lesions. Mutation frequency is the percent (%) white colonies (per total screened) that contained undeleted episomes. We did not consider deletions because most were missing all or part of the reporter region. These deletions had resulted from our initial method of vector preparation and were essentially eliminated by its subsequent modification (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and \u2018Materials and methods-Vector preparation\u2019).

This would result from using the T-containing strand as the repair template (see section, \u2018The mutational spectrum, sequence context, and fate of the bases mutated in response to DNA repair are consistent with APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis\u2019). The mutated plasmids represented repair of 426 T/G, 116 hmU/G, 293 U/G and 90 ab/G mismatches (combined top and bottom lesions, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), and the percent restoration to the C/G base pair was: 72.3, 99, 100 and 100 respectively.

Thus, the ratio of restoring T/G to C/G or converting it to T/A was independent of repair-induced mutagenesis.

This difference accounts for their different mutagenic effects because relocating the MM region upstream of the reporter region (M1F) switches these distances (now &lt;50 bp for bottom\u2014but \u223c5 kb for top-strand lesions respectively), and it also switches the extent of their respective mutagenic effects (cf. top and middle panels of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

The preformed SSB &lt;50 bp from the <i>cis</i> 3\u2032 end of the reporter region in the top strand of FM1 or bottom strand of M1F generates the same mutagenic effect as U/G-ab/G at these positions. We also obtained this result when using non-5\u2032 phosphorylated versions of T/G-mismatch producing oligonucleotides (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Therefore, processing this nick bypasses T/G repair, and generates a substrate that is susceptible to mutagenesis. However, unlike the other lesions, a preformed SSB at \u223c5 kb from the <i>cis</i> 3\u2032 end of the reporter region (bottom and top strand respectively for FM1 and M1F) has little if any mutagenic effect.

Thus, the preponderance of mutations on the G of GpA indicates that its complement on the repair template, the C of TpC, is targeted by the mutagenic process that is recruited during repair. This preference implicates the TpC-preferring APOBEC family members of single strand-specific cytidine deaminases. The left panel of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> outlines how this could occur during the restoration of top strand lesions to C/G after the repair process was initiated by BER at the lesion (green triangle), and subsequent resection of the lesion-containing strand by MMR as described in the previous section. Deamination of the C of TpC would generate TpU, and as discussed by others (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lange et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pe\u00f1a-Diaz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Roberts et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Burns et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Leonard et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Roberts et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Taylor et al., 2013</a>) further processing of the U could generate a number mutational outcomes of the original C (and its complement G). Faithful copying of the U in the repair template would produce an A/U pair. Subsequent replication would result in a G to A transition (complementary C to T transition). On the other hand, the A/U base pair could also be a substrate for a U glycosylase, which would remove the U and generate an abasic site. Subsequent replication of this strand by a high fidelity DNA polymerase would generally insert an A opposite the abasic site\u2013that is, the \u2018A rule\u2019, (<a href=\"#bib65\">Strauss, 2002</a>). The fact that the most frequent mutational outcome at GpA was a G to A transition is consistent with the above two mechanism of generating an A opposite the original C of TpC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, upper left quadrant). On the other hand, replication across the abasic site by various other DNA polymerases could insert a T or C opposite the abasic site and generate G to T or C transversions (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lange et al., 2011</a>), which we also found (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, upper left quadrant).

A lack of discrimination on 3\u2032 nucleotides was also shown in vitro for APOBEC3B (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burns et al., 2013</a>), and reflected in the mutational effect of APOBECs on HIV (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bishop et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Doehle et al., 2005</a>), and in this case the very low preference toward TpCpG (opposite strand CpGpA), reflected the strong bias against CpG in the HIV genome (<a href=\"#bib69\">van der Kuyl and Berkhout, 2012</a>)."

Thus, mutations can occur in a concerted fashion, which is the case for 25\u201330% of the episomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). This figure also shows that the mutational spectra and the dinucleotide contexts of the clustered and unclustered mutations induced by repair of top strand lesions did not differ, and all exhibited the mutational preference for the complement of the C of TpC, that is, the G of GpA. However, the spectra and dinucleotide context of clustered and unclustered mutations induced by repair of bottom strand lesions differed. In contrast to the clustered mutations, which had the same mutational APOBEC signature as the top strand lesions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), the unclustered mutations show less of a preference towards mutating the C of TpC, most evident for those induced by restoration of T/G to C/G (cf. lower 2 panels, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and the lower panels labeled unclustered, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Perhaps, the generation of unclustered mutations with a non-strictly TpC mutational signature in the reporter region is facilitated by the \u223c5 kb distance between its <i>cis</i> 3\u2032 end and the lesion (top panel, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

While knockdown of any one of them marginally affected the mutational frequency, knockdown of two (A3B and A3F) inhibited mutagenesis associated with T/G and U/G repair (middle panel, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Although knocking down all three did not further reduce the mutagenic effect, the lower part of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> shows that only knocking down all three deaminases (siA3(B,F,C)) eliminates the mutational signature associated with deamination of the C of TpC. However, even though the single knockdowns did not substantially inhibit the mutational frequency, they do change the mutational signature with respect of the dinucleotide context (hereafter referred to as the dinucleotide signature) consistent with the extent of their preferences for TpC (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bishop et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Langlois et al., 2005</a>). Thus, knocking down A3C (46% preference for TpC) hardly alters the dinucleotide signature, whereas knocking down A3B (91% preference) had a more profound effect, and the knockdown of A3F (intermediate at 77%) produced an intermediate effect on this signature. Although the numbers of mutations analyzed are relatively low, these data suggest that while the three deaminases compete for substrates generated during repair, A3B is the most important contributor to repair-induced mutagenesis."

Also, as predicted from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, the extent of deaminase binding to the <i>supF</i> reporter of T/G-containing episomes is indifferent to the top or bottom strand location of the mismatch. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> also shows that the deaminase binds to other episomal regions, for example, the T antigen-containing region for both mismatches. This would be expected as the mutagenic effect can extend over 5 kb for both lesions, which is undiminished for T/G but not for U/G. Consistent with this difference, the deaminase binds both <i>supF</i>- and T antigen-containing regions to about the same extent for either the top or bottom strand location of T/G. However, considerably more deaminase binds to the <i>supF</i> reporter gene than T antigen gene for top strand U/G wherein the U is closer to the <i>cis</i> 3\u2032 end of the <i>supF</i> reporter gene than to the T antigen gene (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, top panel). On the other hand, somewhat more deaminase binds to the T antigen gene than <i>supF</i> for bottom strand U/G wherein the U is closer to T antigen gene than to <i>supF</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, bottom panel)."

We also screened other cell lines, including a second HeLa cell isolate, HeLa_KU, for their contents of APOBEC family members as well as the extent to which T/G and U/G repair are mutagenic (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Two of the cell lines (HeLa_KU and 2102ep) exhibited distinct dinucleotide mutational signatures (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Also the repertoire of APOBEC enzymes in these cell lines differed, even quite dramatically between HeLa_JM and HeLa_KU (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Nonetheless, all the cell lines exhibited roughly similar levels of T/G-induced mutagenesis: about the same for HeLa_JM, 143b, and HeLa_KU, and about one-half as much for the other three cell lines (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In contrast, differences between the extent of U/G repair-associated mutagenesis were more marked. Thus, U/G repair was about fivefold more mutagenic in HeLa_JM than in HEK293 although their APOBEC repertoires were comparable. Therefore, factors other than just the availability of these deaminases are required for repair-induced mutagenesis, in agreement with observations on some cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib60\">Roberts et al., 2013</a>)."

Cleavage of the DNA 5\u2032 of the ensuing abasic site (ab) by APE1, and modification of the 3\u2032 ends would generate a single strand break (SSB) that could be extended in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction (green arrow) in a reaction involving XRCC1, polymerase-\u03b2 and LIG3. The blue box encloses components of the MMR pathway. In non-canonical MMR (MutS\u03b1 and MutL\u03b1/PCNA) can hijack U/G-BER intermediates and recruit EXO1 that could generate a gapped DNA 5\u2032 of the lesion (see text). The ensuing single strand, which could serve as the template for DNA repair, can be appropriated by APOBEC deaminases (red box) that could deaminate TpC to TpU and processing the U as described in the text and illustrated <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. As U/G is almost always restored to C/G, the G-strand is the repair template. The right side of the figure shows direct access of a T/G mismatch by MMR (see text). In this case, either the G-strand or T-strand can serve as the repair template for T/G repair, and the T/G-induced mutagenic effect can propagate undiminished for the 5-kb length of the episome. Therefore, we depict the T/G repair intermediate as a migrating D-loop.

We also knocked down a component of the heterodimers (MutS\u03b1, MutL\u03b1) that initiate MMR (MSH2 and MLH1, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> shows that the knockdown of any one of the above proteins was sufficient to reduce mutagenesis induced by repair of T/G or U/G. While the maximal effect of the knockdowns of U/G-induced mutagenesis was about the same for the BER or MMR, the maximal inhibition of T/G-induced mutation by MMR knockdown was greater than that attained by the BER knockdown. This result is consistent with a model whereby MMR can not only highjack BER intermediates generated from a T/G mismatch but also directly access the mismatch, that is, independently of BER. Direct access of T/G by MMR has been demonstrated in vitro (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pluciennik et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pe\u00f1a-Diaz et al., 2012</a>).

Simultaneous knockdown of both proteins returns the mutagenic effect of U/G repair to control levels, a result that suggests the effects of both proteins converge on a common pathway.

The fact that the extent of T/G-induced mutagenesis is more sensitive to the knockdown of MMR than BER suggests that MMR can generate an APOBEC-sensitive substrate independent of (i.e., in addition to) that mediated by BER (right hand side of <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>).

A brief treatment of the reconstituted vectors in the ligation reaction with the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exo<sup>\u2212</sup> Klenow nuclease just prior to their transfection into mammalian cells reduced the amount of gapped plasmids to undetectable amounts (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), eliminated the increase of the mutagenic effect of the 0 MM control during siRNA knockdowns of repair proteins, but did not materially affect the extent of the mutagenesis induced by the 0 MM control or the lesion-containing episomes in experiments with the siRNA controls\u2014cf. the siCtrl for 0 MM, T/G or U/G in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8 and 9</a> with those in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 6 and 7</a> (for HeLa_JM). The Klenow treatment consisted of a 10-min incubation at 37\u00b0C of 6 \u03bcl of the ligation reaction with 3 \u03bcl of a solution that contained 0.2 unit of Klenow polymerase (NEB, M0212), 3 \u00d7 NEBuffer 2 and 100 \u03bcM of dNTP."

More than 99% of the undeleted plasmids contained at least one mutation in the reporter region (data not shown).

Overall, we determined the DNA sequences of \u223c2600 undeleted plasmids, about 5% of which contained small indels in the reporter region that could not be detected by PCR screening. We excluded these sequences from further analysis because their frequency was not correlated with either the type of introduced lesion or even the presence of one. We grouped the rest (\u223c2500) into 155 distinct alignments. We also determined the DNA sequences of \u223c250 blue clones, grouped into 38 alignments. We parsed these alignments and computed mutational data using custom Unix, Perl, and R scripts (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, <a href=\"http://www.R-project.org/\">http://www.R-project.org</a>). We also used R for statistical analysis as indicated in the legends to the Figures or text. We determined the fate of the introduced DNA lesions, and the frequency with which each base of the reporter and mismatch regions was mutated, and to which base it was mutated (i.e., its mutational fate). We determined the mutagenic effect caused by the repair of each type of lesion (T/G, hmU/G, U/G, ab/G) located on the top or bottom strand from the pooled results of each lesion class irrespective of their location, number, or context within the mismatch region of a given vector as these variables did not materially affect the mutagenic effect of their repair (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The major finding was that both lesions and an SSB induced mutagenesis that appeared directional (for most substrates) with respect to the location of the lesion. Based on these observation the authors propose that lesions induce a 3'\u20135' directed excision mechanism, followed by APOBEC-mediated deamination of the ssDNA and subsequent repair synthesis. Curiously the SSB caused the highest level of mutagenesis. Most lesion repair resulted in restoration to a C/G sequence, consistent with a BER-type mechanism."

However, knockdowns of BER components (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) showed that single knockouts provided minor, if any, effect on the mutagenesis frequency. Double knockouts of the BER components APE1 and XRCC1 yielded results that were difficult to interpret because the mutagenesis frequency seen in the 0-mismatch control was elevated to fairly high levels.

Similarly, if BER and NER function in the same mutagenesis pathway proposed in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, why do both need to be knocked down to see an effect? Also, the 0-mismatch substrate shows unusual fluctuations in mutation frequency. For example, there is an unusual mutagenesis pattern in the OMM substrate for the single MLH1 and MSH2 knockdowns compared to the double knockdown (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) that makes me concerned based on the high mutation rate expected for single knockouts of these critical MMR genes.

This bias towards the G-strand is in part due to the T-specific glycosylases (to our knowledge there are none that are specific for the G of a T/G mismatch). But this mechanism probably does not account for all of the G-strand bias, for in other experiments not reported here we found that the sequence context of the mismatch, including the presence of C-methylation can strongly affect the choice of strand selection as repair template. In some cases, the T-strand is used as the repair template more than 50 % of the time and this can occur whether or not repair is mutagenic. These instances quite likely involve direct access of the MMR pathway to the T/G mismatch. Whatever the extent that MMR can compete with BER to directly access a T/G mismatch, a built in bias of MMR towards accessing the T-containing strand would minimize C to T transitions at CpG sites. Even so, transitions at CpG sites represent the most frequent class of SNPs and, with time, CpGs not under selection are converted to TpGs (CpAs). We have modified our paper to more explicitly address this issue and modified <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> to show that the conversion of T/G to T/A results from the mounting of MMR components on the G-containing strand."
