We demonstrate in zebrafish that <i>nf1</i> loss leads to aberrant activation of RAS signaling in <i>MYCN</i>-induced neuroblastomas that arise in these precursors, and that the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) is sufficient to suppress the acceleration of neuroblastoma in <i>nf1</i>-deficient fish, but not the hypertrophy of sympathoadrenal cells in <i>nf1</i> mutant embryos. Thus, even though neuroblastoma is a classical \u201cdevelopmental tumor\u201d, NF1 relies on a very different mechanism to suppress malignant transformation than it does to modulate normal neural crest cell growth. We also show marked synergy in tumor cell killing between MEK inhibitors (trametinib) and retinoids (isotretinoin) in primary <i>nf1a-/-</i> zebrafish neuroblastomas. Thus, our model system has considerable translational potential for investigating new strategies to improve the treatment of very high-risk neuroblastomas with aberrant RAS-MAPK activation."

We demonstrate in zebrafish that <i>nf1</i> loss leads to aberrant activation of RAS signaling in <i>MYCN</i>-induced neuroblastomas that arise in these precursors, and that the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) is sufficient to suppress the acceleration of neuroblastoma in <i>nf1</i>-deficient fish, but not the hypertrophy of sympathoadrenal cells in <i>nf1</i> mutant embryos. Thus, even though neuroblastoma is a classical \u201cdevelopmental tumor\u201d, NF1 relies on a very different mechanism to suppress malignant transformation than it does to modulate normal neural crest cell growth. We also show marked synergy in tumor cell killing between MEK inhibitors (trametinib) and retinoids (isotretinoin) in primary <i>nf1a-/-</i> zebrafish neuroblastomas. Thus, our model system has considerable translational potential for investigating new strategies to improve the treatment of very high-risk neuroblastomas with aberrant RAS-MAPK activation."

This cancer is the most common noncranial solid tumor in childhood, accounting for 8\u201310% of all childhood malignancies and 15% of all cancer deaths in children (<a href=\"#bib18\">Maris and Matthay, 1999</a>). Neuroblastoma is genetically heterogeneous, with multiple interacting genetic mutations required to generate fully transformed malignant tumors. As in many other pediatric cancers, resequencing studies have documented a very low frequency of somatic mutations in neuroblastoma (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cheung et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Molenaar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Pugh et al., 2013</a>), including <i>ALK</i> (~9.2% of cases), <i>PTPN11</i> (~2.9%), <i>ATRX</i> (~2.5%) and <i>NF1</i> (~1%). Amplification and overexpression of the <i>MYCN</i> oncogene occurs in about one-third of patients and is a principal indicator of a poor prognosis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brodeur et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Hansford et al., 2004</a>). Genomic aberrations that inactivate the <i>NF1</i> tumor suppressor gene, including loss-of-function mutations and deletions, as well as decreased expression levels of the gene, have been identified in 6% of primary neuroblastomas and are predictive of a poor outcome (<a href=\"#bib11\">H\u00f6lzel et al., 2010</a>), suggesting an important role for <i>NF1</i> loss in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis."

Loss of <i>NF1</i> in neuroblastoma cells has been shown to mediate resistance to retinoic acid via hyperactive RAS signaling, which can be abolished by enforced expression of <i>NF1</i>-GRD (<a href=\"#bib11\">H\u00f6lzel et al., 2010</a>). However, it is known that NF1 has other functions in PSNS development besides the downmodulation of RAS signaling, because <i>Nf1</i> mutant mice die at birth with evidence of massive overgrowth of neural crest tissues, including the sympathetic ganglia, while overexpression of the GRD domain is unable to reverse this overgrowth (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ismat et al., 2006</a>). In addition, studies showed identical or only modestly elevated RAS-GTP levels in <i>NF1</i>-deficient human neuroblastoma cells, in contrast to highly elevated RAS-GTP levels in <i>NF1</i>-deficient Schwannoma tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Johnson et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">The et al., 1993</a>). These results, coupled with the numerous mutations of <i>NF1</i> that cause the disease neurofibromatosis type 1, but do not appear to affect protein stability or GAP function (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abernathy et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Fahsold et al., 2000</a>), argue that functional domains outside the GRD may mediate important aspects of neurofibromin function in neuroblastoma tumor suppression."

Loss of <i>nf1</i> led to the aberrant activation of RAS signaling in MYCN-induced neuroblastoma, promoting both tumor cell survival and proliferation. We also show that the very aggressive growth properties of MYCN-induced neuroblastomas with loss of <i>nf1</i> are due to aberrant activation of RAS signaling, because the increased penetrance and rapid growth could be suppressed by overexpressing the intact NF1 GRD domain. These findings establish <i>nf1</i>-deficient zebrafish that overexpress <i>MYCN</i> as an ideal animal model system for investigating new strategies to improve treatment of very high-risk neuroblastomas with aberrant RAS-MAPK activation."

For our studies in the zebrafish model, we began with experiments to confirm this surprising result in zebrafish PSNS precursor cells by studying the effect of loss of <i>nf1</i> on growth of the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) during the normal development of early embryos (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We bred the <i>nf1a+/-; nf1b+/-</i> mutant zebrafish line (<a href=\"#bib26\">Shin et al., 2012</a>) with transgenic fish overexpressing either EGFP or mCherry in the PSNS under control of the <i>d\u03b2h</i> promoter (<i>dbh:EGFP</i> or <i>dbh:mCherry</i>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>). As in the mouse, complete loss of <i>nf1</i> led to increased cell numbers in the SCG at 6 dpf (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> with panel A, also panel E). Homozygous loss of <i>nf1a</i> led to the same level of increase in SCG neuronal cell number as homozygous loss of <i>nf1a</i> plus <i>nf1b</i>, while the loss of <i>nf1b</i> had little effect on SCG cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and G</a>), which is consistent with the fact that <i>nf1a</i> is expressed at a much higher level than <i>nf1b</i> in sympathetic neurons as well as the whole embryo during the first week of zebrafish embryonic development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Later in development at 3, 4 and 6 weeks of life, we observed lower relative <i>nf1a</i> and <i>nf1b</i> levels in RNA from the whole fish, and at these time points the expression levels of <i>nf1a</i> and <i>nf1b</i> were similar to each other, without evidence of the predominance of <i>nf1a</i> that was observed at 1 week of age."

The <i>nf1a+/-;nf1b+/-;MYCN</i> zebrafish line was then bred with a <i>nf1a+/-;nf1b+/-;dbh:EGFP</i> transgenic line to obtain transgenic lines harboring one, two, or three <i>nf1</i> mutant alleles, as well as the overexpression <i>MYCN</i> transgene in the PSNS (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2figure supplement 1</a>). The resultant offspring were monitored every 2 weeks, beginning at 4 weeks postfertilization for evidence of fluorescent tumors in the PSNS.

This is consistent with the fact that <i>nf1b</i> is expressed at a much lower level than <i>nf1a</i> in the PSNS during the first week of zebrafish development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). By contrast, the highest neuroblastoma penetrance levels at 4 weeks of age (82.6%) was observed in <i>MYCN</i> transgenic fish with homozygous loss of <i>nf1a</i> and heterozygous loss of <i>nf1b</i>, which produced the earliest onset and highest penetrance of neuroblastoma that we have observed in this model system. Finally, the penetrance of <i>nf1a-/-</i> fish with wild-type <i>nf1b</i> was still very high at 62.5%, indicating that of the two paralogues, the <i>nf1a</i> gene is primarily responsible for tumor suppression in the developing zebrafish sympathetic nervous system."

Neuroblastomas that arose in fish with <i>nf1a+/-;nf1b+/+;EGFP;MYCN</i> and <i>nf1a-/-;nf1b+/+;EGFP;MYCN</i> genotypes were all strongly immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and the pan-neuronal marker Hu, comparable to the fish with wild-type <i>nf1</i> alleles (<i>nf1a+/+;nf1b+/+;EGFP;MYCN</i>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), indicating derivation from sympathetic neuroblast precursors (TH+, Hu+). This is consistent with our previous report in <i>nf1</i> wild-type fish that <i>MYCN</i>-induced neuroblastoma tumors arise from adrenal sympathetic neuroblasts that are prevented from differentiation into chromaffin cells by the overexpression of <i>MYCN</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>). Predominately TH+, Hu- chromaffin cells were detected in the IRG of <i>nf1a</i> mutant fish lacking <i>MYCN</i> overexpression (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that loss of <i>nf1</i> alone does not contribute to developmental arrest of PSNS neuroblasts at the TH+, Hu+ stage. Taken together, these data demonstrate that loss of <i>nf1a</i> synergizes with overexpression of <i>MYCN</i> in the initiation of neuroblastoma, but that loss of <i>nf1a</i> is insufficient to initiate neuroblastoma on its own, possibly because loss of <i>nf1a</i> by itself does not lead to a block of terminal differentiation in PSNS neuroblasts in the IRG."

This leads to a low penetrance, with tumors developing in 515% of animals, and a relatively long latency of 12 to 20 weeks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>). In the current study, we observed positive staining for cleaved caspase-3 at 6 weeks of age in <i>nf1</i> wild-type <i>MYCN</i> transgenic fish, consistent with our previous findings, but we did not detect staining for cleaved caspase-3 in the IRG of either <i>nf1a+/-;nf1b+/+;MYCN;EGFP</i> or <i>nf1a-/-;nf1b+/+;MYCN;EGFP</i> fish (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Thus, loss of either one or both alleles of <i>nf1a</i> blocked the apoptotic response due to overexpression of MYCN in sympathetic neuroblasts, thus promoting tumor cell survival and leading to the development of neuroblastoma at high penetrance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The effects of loss of NF1 on cell survival therefore appear similar to the effects of mutational activation of the ALK tyrosine kinase (<a href=\"#bib29\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>), which also promotes activated signaling through the RAS pathway."

Thus, loss of <i>nf1a</i> resulted in an increased neuroblastoma cell proliferative fraction, consistent with the observation that neuroblastoma tumors grow much more rapidly in fish with homozygous loss of <i>nf1a</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Together, our results support an important role of the tumor suppressor <i>nf1</i> in restricting both the proliferative rate and survival of <i>MYCN</i>-overexpressing hyperplastic sympathetic neuroblast precursors. They also provide important cellular mechanisms that underlie the striking synergy between <i>nf1</i> loss and overexpression of <i>MYCN</i> in neuroblastoma pathogenesis. We then isolated established neuroblastoma tumors of <i>nf1a+/+;nf1b+/+;MYCN</i> and <i>nf1a-/-;nf1b+/+;MYCN</i> zebrafish to examine expression of key genes involved in control of the cell cycle, including <i>ccna1, ccna2, ccnb1, ccnd1, ccnd2, ccnd3, ccne, cdk2, cdk4, cdk6 and e2f1</i>.

Only 12 of 31 <i>nf1a-/-;nf1b+/+;MYCN;EGFP;wt-GRD;mCherry</i> fish developed neuroblastoma tumors by the age of 12 weeks (38.7%, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), compared to 35 of 41 <i>nf1a-/-;nf1b+/+;MYCN;EGFP</i> fish (85.4%, p&lt;0.0001; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), indicating that restoration of the NF1 GAP activity significantly reduced the penetrance of neuroblastoma in the <i>nf1a-/-;nf1b+/+;MYCN;EGFP</i> background. As a control, we also stably expressed the inactive GRD R1276P mutant (designated 'mut-GRD') into <i>nf1a-/-;nf1b+/+;MYCN;EGFP</i> fish, which led to a frequency of neuroblastoma at 12 weeks of age that was identical to that in fish not transgenic for either GRD construct (90.0%, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Because the GRD R1276P mutant specifically disrupts the ability of the GRD to mediate the NF1 GAP activity, this result indicates that NF1 normally suppresses the development of neuroblastoma by downmodulating oncogenic signals from RAS. This finding stands in marked contrast to the inability of the same zebrafish line expressing the same level of GRD to rescue overgrowth of the SCG in normal development, indicating that even though a novel mechanism is responsible for restriction of PSNS neuron growth during normal embryogenesis, NF1 still acts as a classical GAP protein to suppress RAS-MAPK signaling for the suppression of neuroblastoma."

By contrast, coinjection of the mut-GRD domain and the <i>mCherry</i> transgene into <i>nf1a-/-;nf1b+/+;MYCN;EGFP</i> fish yielded strong mCherry fluorescence in 5 of 25 tumors that developed by 7 weeks of age (20.0%; p=0.0237; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B, D, and F</a>).

Isotretinoin, also known as 13-cis retinoic acid, is a retinoid used as frontline therapy for childhood neuroblastoma and improves the event-free survival of combination chemotherapy (<a href=\"#bib19\">Matthay et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Park et al., 2009</a>). In our <i>nf1a-/-;nf1b+/+;MYCN; EGFP</i> fish, isotretinoin alone leads to reduced tumor growth, with essentially stable tumor size over 7 days of treatment at the highest dosages (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). However, the combination of isotretinoin and trametinib was much more active in reducing tumor size, in many fish reducing the GFP fluorescence from the <i>d\u03b2h</i> promoter to the level of the normal IRG at 4 weeks of life (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and C</a>). Importantly, synergistic antitumor effects of trametinib and isotretinoin were documented in vivo at several different dosage combinations by isobologram analysis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), indicating that inhibition of RAS-MAPK signaling can significantly improve the treatment of this very aggressive form of neuroblastoma when it is combined with the inhibition of other key pathways. Because of the very high penetrance and rapid onset of neuroblastoma in our <i>nf1</i>-deficient, MYCN-transgenic zebrafish model, it becomes one of a very few systems in which extensive analysis of the synergistic activity of two or more drugs can be evaluated in primary tumors in vivo. This capability is especially valuable given the recent evidence documenting the profound impact of RAS-MAPK hyperactivation in therapy-resistant neuroblastoma of childhood (<a href=\"#bib6\">Eleveld et al., 2015</a>)."

We show that <i>nf1</i> deficiency in the fish leads to aberrant activation of RAS-MAPK signaling in MYCN-induced neuroblastoma, which promotes both tumor cell survival and proliferation, leading to marked acceleration of tumor onset and increased tumor penetrance. To establish the underlying mechanism of these observations, we performed in vivo structure-function analyses to show that the tumor suppression function of NF1 is mediated through the GAP activity of its GRD domain. The same rescue construct does not suppress the PSNS overgrowth that accompanies <i>nf1</i> loss during development, supporting earlier work implicating a different and still-to-be-identified activity of NF1 in the restriction of the normal growth of PSNS neuroblasts during embryogenesis."

Ostensibly, this would seem inconsistent with our current findings in the zebrafish model implicating downregulation of the RAS pathway in NF1-mediated tumor suppression. However, a recent whole-genome sequencing study revealed that loss of <i>NF1</i> is one of a strikingly high frequency of diverse mutations that hyperactivate the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway in relapsed neuroblastoma (<a href=\"#bib6\">Eleveld et al., 2015</a>). Thus, our inability to demonstrate increased GTP on RAS in <i>NF1</i>-deficient neuroblastoma cell lines may reflect the strong activation of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway in essentially all high-risk neuroblastomas, if not by <i>NF1</i> loss then by direct mutation of <i>RAS</i> itself or other types of mutations. This interpretation becomes more appealing when one realizes that neuroblastomas able to grow in vitro as continuous cell lines are invariably from patients with the very highest risk of treatment failure, and often are obtained from tumor biopsies at the time of relapse. The same relationship likely applies to melanoma cell lines as well, since most of these tumors harbor activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway, including <i>BRAF</i> V600E and <i>NRAS</i> Q61L/R, as well as the loss of <i>NF1</i> in a subset of cases (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Hodis et al., 2012</a>)."

Our results support those studies, in that the GRD domain expressed in the same zebrafish line that suppressed neuroblastoma pathogenesis failed to suppress sympathetic neuroblast overgrowth in <i>nf1</i>-deficient zebrafish embryos. Thus, GAP-independent activities of <i>NF1</i> appear to restrict the growth of normal neural crest-derived tissues during development, as the PSNS overgrowth phenotype was not rescued by the same level of GRD restoration that suppressed the accelerated onset of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>)."

Indeed, it suggests that MEK inhibitors and other agents targeting the RAS-MAPK pathway might suppress the outgrowth of resistant clones and therefore should be investigated as part of the initial combination therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma. Our zebrafish model of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma with <i>nf1</i> loss is ideally suited for the rapid in vivo analysis of the effects of candidate small-molecule inhibitors selected for this purpose. Neuroblastomas can be detected in most MYCN-transgenic fish with <i>nf1a</i> loss by 3 weeks of age, when the fish are very small, making it feasible to test the effectiveness of many drugs and drug combinations for their ability to kill primary neuroblastoma cells in vivo. This advantage of the model is readily apparent in our demonstration of marked antitumor synergy between the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the retinoid isoretinoin in <i>MYCN-</i>overexpressing fish with loss of nf1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Studies using our model should be a valuable asset in devising new therapeutic strategies for neuroblastomas with mutations affecting the RAS-MAPK pathway, which appear to be a major cause of relapse in children with this devastating tumor."

The color deconvolution plugin of ImageJ and the 'H DAB' vector was used to separate the hematoxylin and DAB stains (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ruifrok and Johnston, 2001</a>), and the kidney tubules adjacent to the IRG or tumor region were applied as internal references to define threshold of DAB staining for each IRG or tumor region. For live imaging, zebrafish and embryos were anaesthetized using 0.016% tricaine () and mounted in 4% methycellulose (). A Nikon SMZ1500 microscope equipped with a Nikon digital sight DS-U1 camera was used for capturing both the bright field and fluorescent images from live zebrafish and embryos. For PSNS and neuroblastoma quantification, all animals in the same experiments were imaged under the same conditions and the acquired fluorescent images were quantified using the ImageJ software by measuring the EGFP covered area. For neuroblastoma quantification, the fluorescent area was normalized against the surface area of the fish head as fish size was variable. Overlays were created using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop 7.0.1."

The authors show that <i>nf1</i> loss potentiates transformation by MYCN-overexpression in zebrafish neuroblastoma. <i>nf1</i> deficiency in their model caused aberrant activation of RAS-MAPK signalling in MYCN-induced neuroblastoma, which promoted both tumour cell survival and proliferation, accelerating tumour onset and penetrance. Finally, using a series of in vivo structure-function analyses they show that the tumor suppression function of NF1 is mediated through the GAP activity of its GRD domain. Interesting differences in the capacity of this signal mechanism to suppress PSNS overgrowth in <i>nf1</i> deficient fish during development, further support the notion that a different and unknown activity of NF1 restricts the normal growth of PSNS neuroblasts during embryogenesis. This is a well done, interesting, important and informative study. The experiments are largely well conducted, the results clearly presented, and the data support the conclusions of the authors. While there are some minor issues with the experiments and additional work could be suggested, it is unlikely that these would alter what is an already excellent and interesting paper."
