However, it has been an experimental challenge to directly link the stochastic events at the promoter to transcript production. Here we established a fast fluorescence in situ hybridization (fastFISH) method that takes advantage of intrinsically unstructured nucleic acid sequences to achieve exceptionally fast rates of specific hybridization (\u223c10e7 M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>), and allows deterministic detection of single nascent transcripts. Using a prototypical RNA polymerase, we demonstrated the use of fastFISH to measure the kinetic rates of promoter escape, elongation, and termination in one assay at the single-molecule level, at sub-second temporal resolution. The principles of fastFISH design can be used to study stochasticity in gene regulation, to select targets for gene silencing, and to design nucleic acid nanostructures."

However, it has been an experimental challenge to directly link the stochastic events at the promoter to transcript production. Here we established a fast fluorescence in situ hybridization (fastFISH) method that takes advantage of intrinsically unstructured nucleic acid sequences to achieve exceptionally fast rates of specific hybridization (\u223c10e7 M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>), and allows deterministic detection of single nascent transcripts. Using a prototypical RNA polymerase, we demonstrated the use of fastFISH to measure the kinetic rates of promoter escape, elongation, and termination in one assay at the single-molecule level, at sub-second temporal resolution. The principles of fastFISH design can be used to study stochasticity in gene regulation, to select targets for gene silencing, and to design nucleic acid nanostructures."

Transcription is a dynamic, multi-step process in which RNA polymerase (RNAP) (i) binds to the promoter to form the closed complex (RP<sub>c</sub>); (ii) melts the promoter to form the open complex (RP<sub>o</sub>); (iii) performs several abortive cycles of synthesis and release of short 2\u201312 nt RNA products as the initial transcribing complex (RP<sub>itc</sub>); (iv) escapes the promoter; (v) undergoes some promoter-proximal pausing; (vi) forms an elongating complex (RD<sub>e</sub>) whose processivity can either be interrupted by more pauses or stimulated by trailing RNAPs and elongation factors; and, finally (vii) terminates at the end of the transcription unit (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib8\">DeHaseth et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Murakami and Darst, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cheung and Cramer, 2012</a>). Due to the low copy number of genes in a cell (usually one in prokaryotes and two in eukaryotes), molecular fluctuations at any of the above steps may cause large cell-to-cell variability in the amount of the final RNA transcript produced in populations of otherwise genetically identical cells grown under identical conditions, and thus can affect gene expression, and cell physiology (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ogawa, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Raj and Van Oudenaarden, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yamanaka, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gupta et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lionnet and Singer, 2012</a>). Therefore, understanding how molecular fluctuations at different steps of the transcription cycle alter transcriptional outcomes is required to dissect the mechanism of gene regulation."

For instance, single-molecule assays based on optical nanomanipulation have revealed pausing and backtracking of RD<sub>e</sub> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Neuman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shaevitz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Galburt et al., 2007</a>) and measured the force and the torque generated by RD<sub>e</sub> (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ma et al., 2013</a>). Methods based on magnetic nanomanipulation and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer have probed conformational changes in DNA and RNAP within RP<sub>o</sub>, and RP<sub>itc</sub> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kapanidis et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Revyakin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chakraborty et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Robb et al., 2013</a>). Finally, single-molecule localization studies have probed the dynamics of the initial promoter search by RNAP (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Friedman et al., 2013</a>). However, most current single-molecule methods focus on only one step of transcription, and are not well suited to relate protein-DNA complex assembly and dynamics during multiple stages of the transcription cycle to RNA production. In addition, most methods do not measure RNA production directly, but rather infer it from changes in DNA conformation or movement of RNAP along the DNA. Most recently, single-molecule tracking of key protein-DNA interactions coupled with detection of the RNA production has been demonstrated in the bacterial (<a href=\"#bib12\">Friedman and Gelles, 2012</a>) and human transcription systems (<a href=\"#bib44\">Revyakin et al., 2012</a>). The former study achieved time resolution for RNA detection on the order of \u223c10 s, and thus provided a dynamic, quantitative view of the full transcription cycle of bacterial RNAP. However, time scales of many events in transcription are on the order of \u223c1 s, particularly under physiological conditions (for instance, the residence time of transcription factors on DNA (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib20\">Hager et al., 2009</a>), the rate of initiation and promoter clearance by RNAPs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Revyakin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tang et al., 2009</a>), and the expected time delay between cooperatively elongating RNAPs molecules (<a href=\"#bib10\">Epshtein and Nudler, 2003</a>)). Thus, a real-time method for nascent transcript detection at \u223c1 s time scales would significantly enhance our ability to dissect the dynamics of the transcription process, and to correlate stochastic fluctuations at different steps with transcriptional outcomes."

However, oligonucleotide probes typically hybridize several orders of magnitude slower than diffusion under physiological conditions (effective rate constant <i>k</i><sub><i>on</i></sub> less than 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>, [<a href=\"#bib6\">Chan et al., 1995</a> and references therein]) and, as a result, do not permit real-time nascent RNA detection with common single-molecule setups, such as total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Here we present a fast fluorescence in situ hybridization method (fastFISH) to detect synthesis of nascent RNA transcripts at sub-second time resolution, at the single-molecule level. The method takes advantage of our finding that single-stranded nucleic acid probes with sequences comprised of just three of the four bases (A, U and C for RNA probes, and A, T, and G for the complementary DNA targets) are intrinsically unstructured and, as a result, hybridize at exceptionally fast rates (\u223c10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>) without compromising sequence specificity. As a proof of concept, we applied fastFISH to probe the production of nascent RNA transcripts by the speedy bacteriophage T7 RNA Polymerase (T7 RNAP) in vitro. Furthermore, by using fastFISH in combination with fluorescently labeled RNAP, we dissected the full T7 RNAP transcription cycle (promoter binding, promoter escape, elongation, and termination). FastFISH can be used to study transcription by multi-subunit prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases at the level of stochastic molecular interactions. The rules for generating fastFISH probe-target pairs can also be used for gene silencing, gene profiling and bottom-up assembly of nucleic acid nanostructures (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rothemund, 2006</a>)."

Hybridization of two single-stranded nucleic acid fragments requires unfolding of the fragments into unstructured coils, which then anneal to form an intermolecular base paired helix (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lima et al., 1992</a> and references therein). In support of this notion, nucleic acid probes with less stable secondary structures show faster hybridization rates to complementary nucleic acid targets (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lima et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kushon et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang and Drlica, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gao et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yilmaz et al., 2006</a>). Likewise, decreasing the length of hairpins in conventional molecular beacons increases their hybridization rates (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tsourkas et al., 2003</a>).

We chose RNA sequence with length of 19 nt and GC content between 0.4 and 0.6 as representative of a typical oligonucleotide primer. We found that <i>\u0394G</i><sub><i>37\u00b0C</i></sub> values were mostly negative and widely distributed (\u22121.7 \u00b1 1.7 kCal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>), indicating that an average random 19-mer RNA sequence is mostly structured (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Next, we closely examined a subset of 19-mer RNA sequences that had positive <i>\u0394G</i><sub><i>37\u00b0C</i></sub> (&gt;+2 kCal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>, N = 2,768, &lt;1% of the total pool of random sequences), and found that these mostly unstructured sequences were composed predominantly of only three bases A, U, and C (\u223c84% had only 2 G residues or less, significantly less than the 4.75 G residues expected on average, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The bias towards the lower G-content in the unstructured sequences was not surprising, because guanine is the most potent in base-paring interactions: it forms a triple hydrogen bond with cytosine and a wobble pair with uracil. We then calculated <i>\u0394G</i><sub><i>37\u00b0C</i></sub> for randomly picked 19-mers composed of only A, U, and C (N = 99,777, GC content between 0.4 and 0.6, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and found that these AUC-sequences had mostly positive <i>\u0394G</i><sub><i>37\u00b0C</i></sub>, with a much narrower distribution (+2.5 \u00b1 0.6 kCal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Analysis of other three-base-derived RNA sequences (AUG, CAG, CUG) indicated that AUC-sequences were unique in their largely positive <i>\u0394G</i><sub><i>37\u00b0C</i></sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Calculation of <i>\u0394G</i><sub><i>37\u00b0C</i></sub> for random DNA 19-mers (that could be used as complementary probes for RNA targets) indicated that ATG-based and ATC-based DNA 19-mers were also significantly less structured than their four-base counterparts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the use of the AUC alphabet for RNA targets, and ATG alphabet for DNA probes should allow the fastest annealing reactions under physiological temperature of 37\u00b0C."

This algorithm, commonly used in lossless data compression programs, calculates the minimal number of operations required to reconstruct a sequence of symbols by copying and inserting segments of an existing sub-sequence. Thus, nucleic acid sequences that contain repetitive elements would have a lower LZ complexity (and would be less specific in hybridization) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wright and Church, 2002</a>). We found that three-letter 19-mer sequences had complexity indices of 8.1 \u00b1 0.8 (N = 99,777), while four-letter 19-mers had complexity indices of 9.3 \u00b1 0.8 (N = 338,417, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). As a comparative reference, we calculated complexity indices for tiling 19-mers in all exons of human chromosome 22 to be 8.9 \u00b1 1.0 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Importantly, a significant fraction of three-letter 19-mers (\u223c31%) had complexity indices of 9 and higher, which matched or exceeded the average complexity of human exons. These calculations indicate that a significant fraction of the random probe sequences composed of only three bases nevertheless retain sequence complexity and specificity that match their physiological, four-base derived counterparts."

Such concentrations are generally incompatible with common single-molecule detection setups such as TIRF microscopy, due to high fluorescence background from the freely diffusing, unbound probe molecules.

The hybridization rates of fastFISH probes were near \u223c10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> which exceeded annealing rates of probe-target sequences reported in literature by up to three orders of magnitude. We followed three simple rules in fastFISH probe-target design. First, the targets and the probes should be unstructured, which we achieved using sequences composed of only three bases\u2014A, U, and C for RNA targets, and A, T, and G for DNA probes. We note that the three-base rule of fast hybridization also applies to DNA\u2013DNA pairs (data not shown). Second, a complexity filter should be applied to ensure specificity and 1-to-1 stoichiometry of hybridization. This is essential for single-molecule counting, and cannot be achieved by using repetitive sequences such as poly (A/T). Third, fastFISH probes should be self-quenched. This reduces the fluorescence background from the free probe, and enables the use of near-micromolar probe concentrations for real-time single-molecule imaging. Self-quenching of fastFISH probes likely occurs through random polymer motion and/or contact quenching (<a href=\"#bib24\">Johansson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Marras et al., 2002</a>), and does not rely on hairpin formation (which is known to compromise hybridization rates [<a href=\"#bib56\">Tsourkas et al., 2003</a>]). The choice of probe length of \u223c20 nucleotides was based on the end-to-end distance of a 20-mer nucleic acid duplex, expected to separate the fluorophore and the quencher beyond typical Forster distance (4\u223c6 nm) upon hybridization. Shorter probes in combination with a short-range quencher may be used (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhu et al., 2005</a>) if the potential faster off-rate of the probe is not a concern. We note that probe hybridization rates could be further increased using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes, because the neutral charge of the PNA backbone is expected to reduce the electrostatic repulsion between the probe and the target (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kuhn et al., 2002</a>)."

However, in our experience, the presence of adjacent four-base sequences usually does not interfere with co-transcriptional RNA detection, likely because four-letter sequences become kinetically trapped within their own secondary structures. Nevertheless, the use of a secondary structure prediction tool is recommended to ensure that flanking sequences do not interfere with the fastFISH target."

We recorded several differences between our measurements and previous studies. First, the measured rate of stochastic RP<sub>c</sub> dissociation (<i>T</i><sub><i>0</i></sub> <i>\u223c0.3 s</i>, <i>k</i><sub><i>off</i></sub> \u223c3 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) was higher than what had been reported in previous ensemble and single-molecule studies (<i>k</i><sub><i>off</i></sub> from 0.4 s<sup>\u22121</sup> to 1 s<sup>\u22121</sup> [<a href=\"#bib53\">Tang and Patel, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tang et al., 2009</a>]). Second, the measured rate of promoter escape (<i>T</i><sub><i>abortive</i></sub> \u223c0.2 s, <i>k</i><sub><i>escape</i></sub> \u223c5 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) was higher than in previous ensemble and single-molecule studies (<i>k</i><sub><i>escape</i></sub> from 0.25 s<sup>\u22121</sup> to 1 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, [<a href=\"#bib49\">Skinner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tang et al., 2009</a>]). Third, the measured peak elongation rate (300 \u00b1 60 nt s<sup>\u22121</sup>) was somewhat higher than in previous ensemble measurements (\u223c240 nt s<sup>\u22121</sup>, <a href=\"#bib4\">Bonner et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Golomb and Chamberlin, 1974</a>), and significantly higher than in previous single-molecule measurements (from 40 nt s<sup>\u22121</sup> to 120 nt s<sup>\u22121</sup>, <a href=\"#bib55\">Thomen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Skinner et al., 2004</a>). The overall faster rates measured in our study are likely due to the use of optimal physiological temperatures (37\u00b0C). Indeed, the catalytic rate of the T7 RNAP measured in steady-state conditions is known to increase up to 10-fold in the 20\u00b0C\u201337\u00b0C temperature range (<a href=\"#bib34\">Maslak and Martin, 1993</a>). Another potential contributing factor to the faster observed rates could be that our method to dissect the RNAP transcription cycle does not require the use of force, or covalent modification of the DNA templates."

A different seed for the Matlab random number generator was used in independent trials to ensure independent sampling. (Sets of 3-base 19-mers were used, because a 19-mer is representative of commonly used hybridization probes, and analysis of k = 3<sup>12</sup> 19-mer sequences could be performed on a modern portable computer.) Built-in Matlab routine dec2base was then used to convert sets of k integers into strings of numeric characters of base 3 (0, 1, and 2\u2014for 3-base sequences) or base 4 (0, 1, 2, and 3\u2014for 4-base sequences). The numeric characters were then replaced with A, U, C, and G, and sequences having GC-content \u22650.4 and \u22640.6 were saved as ASCII files, to be processed with the secondary structure prediction tool Mfold. Calculation of free energies of self-folding for DNA and RNA sequences was performed on a personal computer (routine hybrid-ss-min, release 3.8, available at <a href=\"http://mfold.rna.albany.edu\">http://mfold.rna.albany.edu</a>, <a href=\"#bib67\">Zuker, 2003</a>).

For RNA, default folding parameters were used. The free energies of self-folding were extracted from Mfold output files using a home-written Matlab parsing routine, and plotted as normalized probability histograms with 1 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup> binning. At least three independently randomized sets of 3<sup>12</sup> sequences were analyzed for each alphabet (rAUC, rAUG, rCAG, rCUG, rAUGC, ATC, ATG, CAG, CTG, and ATGC) and results from independent sets were consistent to within 0.5%."

The coverslips were then rinsed copiously with deionized water, rinsed twice by dipping in acetone (Chromasolv-Plus) for 10 s, and placed into a 3% solution of aminopropyltriethoxylane (APTES, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) in acetone for 45 min, with gentle shaking. APTES-treated coverslips were then rinsed copiously with deionized water, and blow-dried with nitrogen. 50 \u03bcl drops of solution of 10% PEG-succinimidyl valerate (PEG-SVA, Mw = 5,000, Laysan) and 0.05% biotin-PEG-SVA (Mw = 5,000, Laysan) in 0.45M K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 0.1M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (pH 9.0) was squeezed between pairs of coverslips, and the coverslip pairs were incubated with PEG at 30\u00b0C for 30 min. PEG-treated coverslips were then rinsed copiously with deionized water, blow-dried with nitrogen, and the unreacted amine groups were end-capped by squeezing a 50 \u03bcl drop of solution of 2 mg sulfo-succinimidyl acetate (Pierce) in 0.1M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (Pierce) for 10 min.

An imaging flow cell containing seven reaction channels (volume of each channel: \u223c25 \u03bcl) and side injection ports was constructed using two PEG-treated coverslips and double-sided adhesive tape (3M VHB 4095).

The position of the microscope stage was then actively stabilized in <i>(x,y,z)</i> (see above), and a \u2018mapping\u2019 video of diffraction-limited spots indicating the positions of RNA target molecules was acquired at 2.5 Hz until all RNA spots were photobleached. Single-molecule imaging here and below was conducted in the presence of 0.9 mM Trolox, 2.2 mM protocatechuic acid (PCA), and 10 \u03bcg/ml protocatechuate dehydrogenase (Toyobo), further purified to remove contaminating nuclease activity (Jonas Korlach, Pacific Biosciences, personal communication). After mapping of the RNA targets, the loading buffer was replaced with hybridization buffer (loading buffer plus 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and a solution of fluorescently labeled, self-quenched probes in hybridization buffer at concentrations in the 2\u2013500 nM range was injected into the flow cell at flow rate \u223c50 \u03bcl s<sup>\u22121</sup>. A real-time video of probe binding events (observed as appearance of diffraction-limited fluorescent spots, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) was acquired at 2.5 Hz. For most accurate measurements of the hybridization rates, the concentrations of probes were adjusted empirically to achieve average probe arrival times of 10\u2013100 s. Data analysis was essentially as described (<a href=\"#bib44\">Revyakin et al., 2012</a>). Briefly, single-molecule spots were identified in every frame of the target and probe videos using the software Insight (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huang et al., 2010</a>), and each spot was localized in <i>(x,y)</i> by fitting a 5 \u00d7 5 pixel spot intensity distribution to a 2D Gaussian. The <i>(x,y)</i> coordinates of all identified spots in all video frames were grouped into clusters (\u2018blobs\u2019) using a 2D histogram (1 pixel binning), and the average <i>(x,y)</i> of every blob (indicating the locations of target and probe molecules) was calculated. Then, for every target blob, the closest probe blob was found, the deviations <i>\u0394x\u0394y</i> were calculated for all such probe-target pairs, and plotted as a 2D histogram (\u2018the co-localization plot\u2019). RNA targets that were located within two standard deviations of the central peak at position (0,0) of the co-localization plot (\u223c40 nm) were selected. Such \u2018active\u2019 RNA molecules typically comprised \u223c30% of all RNA molecules. Time series of probe-target binding was generated for every active RNA (using the mean fluorescence intensity from a 5 \u00d7 5 pixel region of interest (ROI), with the mean intensity of the ROI perimeter pixels subtracted as background). Each time series was examined, and the video frame corresponding to the probe arrival at the target was identified (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The dataset containing all probe arrival times (<i>T</i><sub><i>wait</i></sub>, usually 100\u2013500 events) was binned, with the center of the first bin corresponding to the minimal observed <i>T</i><sub><i>wait</i></sub>, the center of the last bin corresponding to the maximal observed <i>T</i><sub><i>wait</i></sub>, and the number of bins <i>N</i><sub><i>bins</i></sub> = <i>\u00b3\u221a(2N</i><sub><i>events</i></sub><i>)</i> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Scott, 1992</a>). The first bin was discarded to account for the discontinuity, and for the lag time due to the buffer exchange during probe injection. The probability histogram of <i>T</i><sub><i>wait</i></sub> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) was fit to a single exponential function using the Matlab built-in routine <span class=\"monospace\">nlinfit</span>, which gave an estimate of the characteristic hybridization time (95% confidence interval), and the goodness of fit (typically, R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.98).

For every frame of the heat map, the centers of mass of RNAP and probe signal intensity distributions were calculated, and normalized by setting the maximum intensity to 1, and weight-averaged profiles of all RNAP and probe binding events were generated. The rising edges of the averaged RNAP and probe profiles were found by fitting the maxima of the respective first derivatives to second-degree polynomial, and <i>\u0394T</i><sub><i>on</i></sub> was calculated by subtracting the edge for probe from the edge for RNAP. The same approach was used to calculate <i>\u0394T</i><sub><i>off</i></sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), except that video frames in which RNAP dissociated from the DNA (<i>T</i><sub><i>off</i></sub>) were used as references to post-synchronize RNAP- and probe-DNA dissociation events to generate respective heat maps, and to calculate weight-averaged profiles of all RNAP and probe dissociation events."

The amount of work that went into the design of the fastFISH probes is impressive, and the general idea of removing internal structures with individual oligos to accelerate annealing, and in particular using three nucleotides only, will also have a broad appeal."

Nevertheless, the direct observation of various stages of transcription starting from RNAP binding until its dissociation from the transcript has established important benchmarks for future studies of such systems and point toward exciting future possibilities of more complex systems including those with RNA polymerase II. The fastFISH approach was absolutely necessary for this work because the overall duration of the reaction was about 1\u20132 s and any slower annealing would have missed the majority of events."

Thus, we believe that the three-letter rule is important for selection of hybridization pairs, regardless of the probe length. In addition, as the reviewers point out, we were concerned about fast off-rates of short probes, particularly at the temperature optimal for transcriptional activity. Thus we added two sentences in the first paragraph of the Discussion section: \u201cThe choice of probe length of \u223c20 nucleotides was based on the end-to-end distance of a 20-mer nucleic acid duplex (\u223c6.8 nm), expected to separate the fluorophore and the quencher out of the range of resonance energy transfer upon hybridization. Shorter probes in combination with a short-range quencher may be used (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhu et al. 2005</a>) if the potential faster off-rate of the probe is not a concern.\u201d"
