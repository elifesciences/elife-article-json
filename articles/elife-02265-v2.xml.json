Breathing, for example, involves the sequential activation of numerous muscles hypothesized to be driven by a primary respiratory oscillator, the preB\u00f6tzinger Complex, and at least one other as-yet unidentified rhythmogenic population. We tested the roles of <i>Atoh1-</i>, <i>Phox2b-</i>, and <i>Dbx1-</i>derived neurons (three groups that have known roles in respiration) in the generation and coordination of respiratory output. We found that <i>Dbx1</i>-derived neurons are necessary for all respiratory behaviors, whereas independent but coupled respiratory rhythms persist from at least three different motor pools after eliminating or silencing <i>Phox2b-</i> or <i>Atoh1</i>-expressing hindbrain neurons. Without <i>Atoh1</i> neurons, however, the motor pools become temporally disorganized and coupling between independent respiratory oscillators decreases. We propose <i>Atoh1</i> neurons tune the sequential activation of independent oscillators essential for the fine control of different muscles during breathing."

Breathing, for example, involves the sequential activation of numerous muscles hypothesized to be driven by a primary respiratory oscillator, the preB\u00f6tzinger Complex, and at least one other as-yet unidentified rhythmogenic population. We tested the roles of <i>Atoh1-</i>, <i>Phox2b-</i>, and <i>Dbx1-</i>derived neurons (three groups that have known roles in respiration) in the generation and coordination of respiratory output. We found that <i>Dbx1</i>-derived neurons are necessary for all respiratory behaviors, whereas independent but coupled respiratory rhythms persist from at least three different motor pools after eliminating or silencing <i>Phox2b-</i> or <i>Atoh1</i>-expressing hindbrain neurons. Without <i>Atoh1</i> neurons, however, the motor pools become temporally disorganized and coupling between independent respiratory oscillators decreases. We propose <i>Atoh1</i> neurons tune the sequential activation of independent oscillators essential for the fine control of different muscles during breathing."

As the lungs increase in volume, the pressure inside them drops and air is drawn in. Relaxation of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles compresses the lungs, causing us to exhale."

The IC muscle is innervated by motoneurons in the caudal thoracic spinal cord. Like the lumbar innervated abdomen, the IC is active during expiration in vivo and in more mature in vitro preparations (<a href=\"#bib57\">Miller et al., 1985</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Iscoe, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Legrand and Troyer, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Iizuka, 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2004</a>). As in preparations from older animals, we found rhythmic motor output from both cervical and lumbar roots that corresponded to rhythmic respiratory muscle activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These outputs were silenced by transection above the first cervical root (not shown), and thus require the hindbrain. In late fetal (E18.5) preparations, however, both lumbar motor roots and intercostal EMG were often co-active with cervical output (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D,F</a>). Importantly, however, cervical, lumbar, and IC activities were not identical arguing against a single source of respiratory drive for all respiratory motor pools. Cervical bursts were present without lumbar motor root or intercostal (IC) muscle activity, as is most common in adult rodents at rest (see arrows in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), whereas both lumbar and IC activity were often active prior to the onset of cervical output, as in older preparations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013I</a>). These data are consistent with the presence of functional and independent rhythmogenic sources of respiratory drive to cervical, thoracic, and lumbar motor pools in E18.5 mice. It further suggests these different patterns of temporal co-activation from different respiratory motor pools might be the consequence of variations in the coupling between independent respiratory oscillators (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J\u2013L</a>)."

Our present results also match invertebrate preparations where individual oscillators increase their frequency after uncoupling from a network (<a href=\"#bib61\">Mulloney, 1997</a>). These data suggest that, in WT animals, each respiratory motor pool receives drive from independent but interconnected oscillators and that these oscillators persist in RL<sup>\u2212</sup>/RTN<sup>\u2212</sup> mice. These data further suggest that the loss of both RTN and RL neurons accentuates free-running oscillator activity induced by selective neuromodulation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Doi and Ramirez, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2010</a>)."

Consistent with their stimulatory role, the selective loss of RTN neurons leads to a significant prolongation of the inspiratory period. After the loss of both RL and RTN populations, however, the respiratory period recovered almost to WT levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E,G</a>). This raised the possibility that RL neurons mediate a net inhibitory effect on respiratory networks, possibly via activation of inhibitory neurons. Inhibition is essential for normal respiratory output to control the timing and pattern of the different respiratory muscles (<a href=\"#bib49\">Marder and Bucher, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ramirez and Viemari, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Feldman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Janczewski et al., 2013</a>).

                                "text": "Respiratory networks produce several motor behaviors besides the basic cervical (eupneic) respiratory pattern. The best characterized of these are sighs (<a href=\"#bib74\">Ramirez and Viemari, 2005</a>), which are generated within the medulla, persist in reduced preparations, are first seen during late embryonic stages, and are increased after SP application (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lieske et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gray et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ballanyi and Ruangkittisakul, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chapuis et al., 2014</a>). Sighs consist of a biphasic inspiratory (cervical) burst with an initial peak of typical amplitude that, before decaying, gives rise to a larger amplitude sigh burst. This biphasic burst pattern is present under baseline conditions, both in vivo and in vitro. The sigh component of these biphasic motor outputs, however, can be decoupled from normal \u2018eupneic\u2019 bursts either pharmacologically or by blockade of inhibition (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lieske et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ramirez and Viemari, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Tryba et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chapuis et al., 2014</a>). Our WT E18.5 preparations showed biphasic cervical bursts similar to sighs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B,D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B,F,G,I</a>). Under baseline conditions, 6 of 11 preparations produced biphasic cervical bursts (54.5%). In the presence of 1 \u00b5M SP, biphasic cervical bursts increased and were present in 3 of 4 preparations (75%). Alternately, biphasic bursts decreased in the presence of 10<sup>\u221212</sup> M SST and were present in only 3 of 7 (42.9%) preparations. This is lower than what was recently found in E18.5 mouse in vitro slice preparations but not unreasonable given the elevated potassium used to stimulate respiratory-related output in slices (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chapuis et al., 2014</a>). Under baseline conditions in preparations showing biphasic cervical bursts, these augmented bursts occurred in 8.87 \u00b1 3.16% of total cervical bursts. In addition, biphasic cervical bursts also showed a consistent biphasic lumbar pattern in which activity occurred primarily during the initial cervical peak (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B,F,G,I</a>). SP increased the frequency of biphasic cervical bursts, which were often accompanied by an active inhibition of lumbar output during the second cervical peak (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This complex respiratory pattern was also found in cervical-lumbar-intercostal and cervical-lumbar-VII recordings (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). In contrast to lumbar output, intercostal EMG activity was most active during the augmented burst, whereas VII output could be active during either burst (<a href=\"#bib100\">van Lunteren et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lieske et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ramirez and Viemari, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a>). RL<sup>+</sup>/RTN<sup>\u2212</sup> mice showed occasional biphasic cervical bursts, although lumbar activity in these events occurred during the larger peak (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Note that some cervical bursts that lack a biphasic component can show either smaller or larger amplitudes than putative sigh-bursts (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E,H</a>)."

The interval between peaks in this 4.1% of respiratory bursts can be attributed to the inherent noise and variability in the output signals and are unlikely to reflect actual temporal disparity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>). The temporal distribution for RL<sup>\u2212</sup>/RTN<sup>\u2212</sup> mice showed a single peak temporal difference that was significantly less than in WT (median peak lag in WT = \u221239 ms and RL<sup>\u2212</sup>/RTN<sup>\u2212</sup> mice = \u22123 ms, p&lt;0.0016; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,I</a>). This loss of normal temporal interval was not a simple consequence of low excitability in the network, because neither excitation with SP nor preB\u00f6tC inhibition with SST (<a href=\"#bib64\">Onimaru et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gray et al., 2010</a>) generated any respiratory cycles with clear lumbar-cervical delay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

The appearance of uncoupled fictive breaths, especially evident in cervical-lumbar-VII recordings, led us to wonder whether what might appear to be deletions at longer time scales (&gt;1 s) were, in fact, only changes in the relative timing of respiratory output such that lumbar or VII activity occurs at a different phase of the respiratory cycle (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In vivo, the peak of activity for many respiratory neurons is delayed to late in the expiratory period (<a href=\"#bib75\">Richter, 1982</a>). This type of phase switching is seen when moving from the simultaneous activation of legs during hopping to alternating activation during walking. To address this, we determined the phase of the peaks of lumbar and VII motor output during the cervical respiratory period (defined as \u03a6 [0\u2013360\u00b0] for each individual respiratory burst, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib90\">Strohl, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hwang et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Plowman et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Huangfu et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Iscoe, 1998</a>).

In RL<sup>\u2212</sup>/RTN<sup>\u2212</sup> mice, the peak of both lumbar and VII activity also occurred just prior to cervical output (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

In WT mice we found no secondary peaks that would indicate consistent phase differences. In RL<sup>\u2212</sup>/RTN<sup>\u2212</sup> mice, however, the lumbar trace showed a small second peak around 50\u00b0 (arrows in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,E</a>).

Together, however, these data suggest an absence of a longer timescale reorganization of respiratory activity. They also show that both lumbar and VII outputs are still largely coupled to cervical output, with changes in the details of their relative timing."

The elimination of both RL and RTN neurons, however, recovered baseline respiratory period. Not only does this reveal a previously unknown net inhibitory role for RL neurons in the control of breathing, but it also demonstrates that neither of these populations is necessary or sufficient for expiratory motor output, since both cervical and lumbar respiratory-related outputs persist after their genetic elimination. In the absence of <i>Dbx1</i>-derived neurons, however, all rhythmic respiratory outputs were eliminated. The absence of both cervical and lumbar rhythms in <i>Dbx1</i> mutant mice suggests that in addition to its inspiratory rhythmogenic role in the preB\u00f6tC, <i>Dbx1</i> is essential for the development of neurons necessary for the expression of rhythmic respiratory output from other motor pools, although the exact location of these neurons remains unknown. <i>Dbx1-</i>dependent neurons have recently been shown to play an important role in locomotor pattern generation (<a href=\"#bib93\">Talpalar et al., 2013</a>)."

We propose that this is the case for three reasons. First, we found that lumbar and cervical activities were not identical. Either output could occur either in isolation or with a distinct temporal separation. This same pattern of independent motor activity was also seen in respiratory output from internal intercostal muscles or VII motor roots, suggesting it is a general property of respiratory motor pools. Second, output from lumbar and thoracic roots (which innervate expiratory musculature) has previously been shown to require structures outside of the preB\u00f6tC and the rostral ventral respiratory group, which are the well-established sources of rhythmic inspiratory drive and premotor innervation to the phrenic motor pool (<a href=\"#bib57\">Miller et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Merrill and Lipski, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Sasaki et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Iscoe, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Janczewski et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">de Almeida et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ford and Kirkwood, 2013</a>). These anatomical differences are consistent with independent sources of respiratory drive to different motor pools serving inspiration and expiration, respectively, although we cannot rule out changes in connectivity during maturation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Iscoe, 1998</a>). Third, simultaneous co-activation of cervical and lumbar roots is also present in older in vitro rat preparations, suggesting it is only the relative percentage of respiratory bursts showing one or the other pattern that changes, not the ability to generate each pattern (<a href=\"#bib91\">Taccola et al., 2007</a>)."

Respiratory networks are capable of reconfiguring to produce different patterns of respiratory outputs, such as sighs, depending upon the behavioral or modulatory state of the organism (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lieske et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Doi and Ramirez, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chapuis et al., 2014</a>). We extend those findings to include activation of lumbar, thoracic, and VII motor pools, which are normally, but not obligatorily, active during different phases of the respiratory cycle. We observed that sigh-like cervical patterns corresponded with lumbar outputs active primarily only during the initial eupneic phase, whereas intercostal and VII outputs were active during both biphasic cervical bursts. In contrast to these motor outputs, 95% of preB\u00f6tC inspiratory neurons are active during both inspiratory bursts and during sighs, which suggests that the differential gating of motor output occurs outside the putative inspiratory oscillator or by transient reconfigurations within respiratory populations (<a href=\"#bib99\">Tryba et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chapuis et al., 2014</a>). We speculate that the differences in the timing and presence of respiratory outputs from lumbar and thoracic motor pools between these late fetal and more mature preparations are related to differences in the balance of synaptic interactions between hindbrain neurons and not the absence of connectivity (<a href=\"#bib96\">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bouvier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Perreault and Glover, 2013</a>)."

Lumbar outputs increased but cervical decreased their percentage of solitary activity. These data are inconsistent with a role for RL and RTN populations in generating lumbar respiratory output. It is important to note that the strong coupling of the cervical, lumbar, and VII motor roots in RL<sup>\u2212</sup>/RTN<sup>\u2212</sup> mice suggests that the excitatory connections likely arising from the preB\u00f6tC are maintained (<a href=\"#bib94\">Tan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Feldman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Moore et al., 2013</a>). In RL<sup>\u2212</sup>/RTN<sup>\u2212</sup> mice, the temporal overlap between cervical and lumbar output was nearly complete, again raising the question of the independence of the drives to each motor pool. Because there is no evidence in the literature that loss of <i>Atoh1</i> would affect <i>Atoh1</i>-independent projection patterns, we suggest the temporal gap is lost because of differences in connectivity between hindbrain respiratory populations (<a href=\"#bib56\">Miesegaes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Rose et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kohl et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Perreault and Glover, 2013</a>).

It is also possible, however, that the loss of <i>Atoh1</i> neurons indirectly affects respiratory networks by modulating the development of inhibitory populations or the overall maturation of hindbrain circuits. It is important to point out that we were unable to selectively eliminate lumbar motor output in any of our genetic manipulations. While our data are consistent with the presence of independent respiratory oscillators, we cannot rule out that the variability we see between respiratory motor pools is the consequence of higher level network interactions between a single distributed respiratory oscillator and small pools of respiratory premotor neurons (<a href=\"#bib85\">Smith et al., 2007</a>).

The dissections were done while keeping the embryos submerged in cold (4\u00b0C) artificial cerebral spinal fluid (regular/enhanced = WT [n = 17/5]; RL<sup>\u2212</sup>/RTN<sup>\u2212</sup>[n = 13/6]; RL<sup>+</sup>/RTN<sup>\u2212</sup>[n = 5/1]; RL<sup>+</sup>/RTN<sup>silent</sup>[n = 3/0]; aCSF (in mM): 124 NaCl, 3/5 KCl, 1.5/2.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.0/1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25.0/26.0 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>/1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 D-Glucose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to pH = 7.4) and transferred into a partitioned 6 ml recording chamber, which were separately gravity fed by reservoirs of heated (25\u00b0C\u201326\u00b0C) and aerated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) aCSF at a rate of 3\u20134 ml/min. After transferring the preparation into the recording chamber, the brainstem and spinal cord compartments were rendered mutually impervious with petroleum jelly. Allowing \u223c30 min for stabilization, the extracellular electrophysiological recordings were made (acquisition rate 4 kHz) simultaneously from a cervical (C2\u2013C6) and a lumbar (L1) ventral spinal motor root using suction electrodes, differentially amplified (low noise Grass Instruments, band pass filtering [0.3\u20133 kHz]), digitized using an analog to digital converter (AD instruments, Colorado Springs, CO) and then integrated over time (absolute value with a 100 ms decay time constant) using LabChart 7 Pro software (version 7.2.4, AD Instruments). Similarly, triple recordings were also made using an additional suction electrode to record from facial nerve or a sharp tungsten microelectrode (10 m\u03a9 impedance and 1 \u00b5m tip diameter; FHC, inc.) to record electromyograph from intercostal muscle XI (IC) in a non-partitioned bath as previously described in neonatal rats (<a href=\"#bib32\">Iizuka, 1999</a>). After recording baseline activity, 1 \u03bcM substance P (SP) or 10<sup>\u221212</sup> M somatostatin (SST) in aCSF was added selectively to the brainstem compartment in the partitioned bath preparations. In some early experiments, we used an enhanced aCSF suggested to increase the percentage of respiratory bursts with lumbar activity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Iizuka, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Ruangkittisakul et al., 2008</a>). We found no changes in the percent of lumbar bursts nor any differences in the phase distributions of fictive breaths, so we combined both solutions when comparing deletion and time lag. The peak time and amplitude, phase difference and inter-burst intervals (period) were determined for cervical, lumbar, and facial nerve bursts as well as for IC. The comparisons of cervical and lumbar periods indicative of respiratory frequency were made between the different genotypes by direct comparison, whereas the amplitudes of the integrated respiratory bursts were first normalized against the baseline arithmetic mean determined individually. The percentage of inspiratory and expiratory deletions was also calculated from each recording and these values were then compared between treatments and mouse lines. In cases of triple recording involving facial nerve, the relative degree of phase separation for the lumbar and facial nerve bursts from the preceding cervical burst (\u03a6) was determined by equating the instantaneous cervical inter-burst interval period to 360\u00b0. Moreover, coupling efficiencies of rhythms whose integrated peaks occurred within 1 s period of a cervical inspiratory burst were quantified and compared in facial nerve and IC triple recordings."

On-cell and whole-cell patch recordings were obtained using infrared-enhanced differential interference contrast videomicroscopy (IR-DIC) after fluorescent identification of <i>Atoh1</i>-derived neurons in both YFP and tdTomato reporter mice. ACSF contained (in mM): 124 NaCl, 9 KCl, 0.5 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHC0<sub>3</sub>, 30 D-glucose, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>*2H<sub>2</sub>0, and 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>.

Patch recordings employed a Dagan IX2-700 amplifier (Minneapolis, MN). Respiratory-related motor output was monitored from XII nerves with extracellular suction electrodes and a high-gain differential amplifier with band-pass filtering (0.3\u20131 kHz) (Dagan EX4-400), full-wave rectified and smoothed for display. Data were acquired using Chart software and a Powerlab 4/30 (ADInstruments). A liquid junction potential, which measured 1 mV, was not corrected in current-clamp experiments. We used the following patch solution containing (in mM): 140 K-gluconate, 5 NaCl, 0.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 Na(<sub>3</sub>)-GTP (pH = 7.2 using KOH). We added 2\u20134 \u00b5l/ml of Alexa Fluor 568 hydrazide (Na<sup>+</sup> salt, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to the patch solution for fluorescent visualization of morphology. Neurons were visually identified using both IR-DIC videomicroscopy and epifluorescence illumination (X-Cite 120, EXFO, Montreal, Canada) and a fluorescent filter to identify YFP or tdTomato labeled cells.

They then go on to show that the RL is necessary for expiration to lead inspiration as is the 'predominant' mode in adults and conclude it provides coordinating inhibition to the inspiratory rhythm generator in the PreBotC.

Originally it is claimed that a lag of &gt;150 ms between expiration and inspiration is normal for the adult nervous system \u201c...active expiration usually precedes inspiratory output by hundreds of milliseconds (when both are present...'), but the % of fictive 'breaths' with this relation is not given. Then the normal WT coordination in the embryonic nervous system is described with only \u223c26% of fictive 'breaths' show a lag of &gt;150 ms between expiration and inspiration. Thus it is unclear to me what is normal for this coordination: near synchrony or an expiratory lead (inspiratory lag). If majority %ages of an expiratory lead (inspiratory lag) are seen in adult nervous system then adult-like is appropriate as a description for this coordination. Even then the authors should each time make clear that they are speaking of coordination at all times, because the inspiration and expiration can be near coincident (i.e., near synchrony is a coordination) but that the ability of expiration to lead is missing in the transgenic lines (genetic deletions). Thus coordination is always present but certain intervals, rare though they may be in WT embryonic nervous system, are not present in the transgenics. Making this distinction clear is important because otherwise it is hard for a non-respiration expert to follow. In several places in the text I have high-lighted places where the authors should make this distinction."

One possibility is that the AtOH1 neurons generate expiration while the DBX1 neurons generate inspiration.

Expiration itself is often divided into stages with the period just prior to inspiration being called either late expiration or pre-inspiration. Even inspiration itself is more complicated, as each specific burst could be a eupneic breath, a sigh, a gasp or unrelated to breathing. We have decided it is more precise to step back from the terms inspiration and expiration but rather to simply name the motor root we are recording from, i.e., cervical or lumbar. We recognize it is widely accepted to describe cervical motor output as inspiration, but using only that one term was somewhat unwieldy. This is similar to descriptions of motor output in invertebrate systems. We do in places use the term \u201cbreath\u201d in relation to the motor bursts to reinforce the respiratory-related nature of these outputs."

First, at the suggestion of all three reviewers, we examined the relationship between cervical and lumbar root activity with EMG muscle activity recorded from the XIth internal intercostal space (ICXI) in wild-type animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). ICXI was chosen because it was accessible, allowed for simultaneous cervical and lumbar root recording, and, most importantly, was previously shown to be active out of phase with the inspiratory drive from cervical roots both in vivo and in previous in vitro experiments (<a href=\"#bib34\">Iizuka, 2004</a>). ICXI is driven by motoneurons in the caudal thoracic spinal cord, so it sits between the cervical and lumbar motor pools previously analyzed. Consistent with our previous recordings, the peak of ICXI activity most often occurred close in time to both cervical and lumbar respiratory outputs. However, also similar to previous recordings, the output of ICXI was not identical to cervical or lumbar outputs. Even in breaths in which lumbar output preceded cervical output, ICXI could be co-active with lumbar or both lumbar and cervical (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In contrast, in breaths with biphasic sigh-like cervical bursts, ICXI was most active during the sigh-like burst (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus when recording from 3 roots, we found the timing and presence of activity were not consistent with being inspiratory output. These data are also consistent with previous work in rats and cats showing that respiratory drives to thoracic and lumbar motor pools, which drive caudal intercostal and abdominal muscles, emanate from neurons outside the preB\u00f6tzinger Complex or rVRG, the proposed sources of inspiratory rhythm generation and phrenic premotor drive, respectively."

Additionally, we found that each root can be active independently of the other and that for any breath any temporal sequence of the three motor roots is possible. In Atoh1 mutant mice, this same pattern of co-expression and independence of motor pool output persists.

They then go on to show that the RL is necessary for expiration to lead inspiration as is the 'predominant' mode in adults and conclude it provides coordinating inhibition to the inspiratory rhythm generator in the PreBotC.

What is \u201cnormal\u201d is complicated. The respiratory field has largely been interested in the question of inspiration and most (nearly all) of the analysis surrounding expiratory activity has been qualitative. Normally expiration is completely passive in adult mammals. Active respiratory output to abdominal and internal intercostal muscles is state-dependent and usually requires a stimulus such as CO2 or hypoxia, which boosts respiratory function overall. Motor output is then described as expiratory if it is not co-active with the diaphragm. Abdominal motor output is silent or at least decreased during inspiration. There is actually very little quantitative analysis of the temporal relation between late expiration (also referred to as pre-inspiration, E2, or Eb) with inspiration. We found one reference where we could infer the delay between abdominal and phrenic output to vary between less than 300ms to over 500 ms in an adult, anesthetized rat breathing elevated CO2 or decreased O2 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Iizuka and Fregosi, 2007</a>). We also cite a second reference showing that a minority of post-natal in vitro preparations also produce breaths where cervical and lumbar roots are co-active (<a href=\"#bib91\">Taccola et al., 2007</a>).

Importantly, we propose RL neurons play an essential role in the coordination of mammalian breathing behavior by modulating the inhibitory interneurons that produce the temporal lag between independent oscillators. This modulation also helps stabilize coupled oscillators preventing independent or unwanted activation. This has the advantage that temporal delays can be controlled without strongly affecting the rhythmogenic properties of the underlying oscillators (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hill et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Grillner, 2006</a>). It is also possible, however, that loss of Atoh1 neurons indirectly affects respiratory networks by modulating the development of inhibitory populations or the overall maturation of hindbrain circuits."

The authors need to address this issue squarely</i>."

While our data are consistent with the presence of independent respiratory oscillators, we cannot rule out that the variability we see between respiratory motor pools is the consequence of higher level network interactions between a single distributed respiratory oscillator and small pools of respiratory premotor neurons (<a href=\"#bib85\">Smith et al., 2007</a>). Similarly, whether there are discrete anatomical boundaries between these putative independent oscillators is also unknown."
