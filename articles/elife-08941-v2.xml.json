During autophagy, cytoplasmic material is delivered into the lysosomal system by organelles called autophagosomes. Autophagosomes form in a de novo manner and, in the course of their formation, isolate cargo material from the rest of the cytoplasm. Cargo specificity is conferred by autophagic cargo receptors that selectively link the cargo to the autophagosomal membrane decorated with ATG8 family proteins such as LC3B. Here we show that the human cargo receptor p62/SQSTM-1 employs oligomerization to stabilize its interaction with LC3B and linear ubiquitin when they are clustered on surfaces. Thus, oligomerization enables p62 to simultaneously select for the isolation membrane and the ubiquitinated cargo. We further show in a fully reconstituted system that the interaction of p62 with ubiquitin and LC3B is sufficient to bend the membrane around the cargo."

During autophagy, cytoplasmic material is delivered into the lysosomal system by organelles called autophagosomes. Autophagosomes form in a de novo manner and, in the course of their formation, isolate cargo material from the rest of the cytoplasm. Cargo specificity is conferred by autophagic cargo receptors that selectively link the cargo to the autophagosomal membrane decorated with ATG8 family proteins such as LC3B. Here we show that the human cargo receptor p62/SQSTM-1 employs oligomerization to stabilize its interaction with LC3B and linear ubiquitin when they are clustered on surfaces. Thus, oligomerization enables p62 to simultaneously select for the isolation membrane and the ubiquitinated cargo. We further show in a fully reconstituted system that the interaction of p62 with ubiquitin and LC3B is sufficient to bend the membrane around the cargo."

A protein called p62 is able to specifically bind to damaged proteins that have been covered with a molecule called ubiquitin. It also interacts with proteins of the ATG8 family that are found on the surface of the developing autophagosome. In this way, p62 operates as an adaptor that brings damaged proteins into contact with autophagosomes in preparation for autophagy. However, since a single p62 molecule can only interact with one ubiquitin molecule and one ATG8 protein, it is not clear how it is able to specifically select only the proteins that carry many ubiquitin tags."

Wurzer, Zaffagnini et al. use a combination of biochemical and cell biological techniques to study these oligomers in human cells. The experiments show that the oligomers are able to bind to many ubiquitin tags on a single structure. This enables a p62 oligomer to form a stronger connection to the damaged protein than a single p62 unit can. At the same time, the oligomer can interact with many ATG8 proteins, which tend to be found in clusters only on the surface of the autophagosome."

Wurzer, Zaffagnini et al. observed that the binding of p62 oligomers to ATG8 proteins and damaged structures with ubiquitin tags, drive the bending of the membrane around these structures. Wurzer, Zaffagnini et al.\u2019s findings reveal how the formation of oligomers allows p62 to specifically select and target damaged proteins that are covered with many ubiquitin tags for destruction, while sparing other materials. Other proteins that are closely related to p62 also help to select cell materials for autophagy, so a future challenge is to find out whether these proteins work in a similar way."

The lysosomal system mediates degradation of large and bulky substances that cannot be degraded by other means, for example, the proteasome. A major pathway for the degradation of cytoplasmic material\u00a0is macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">De Duve and Wattiaux, 1966</a>). During autophagy, double membrane-bound organelles called autophagosomes are formed that, upon fusion with the lysosomal system, deliver cytoplasmic cargo material for degradation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Kraft and Martens, 2012</a>). Autophagosomes form in a de novo manner. Initially, small-membrane structures called isolation membranes or phagophores are observed, which gradually enclose cargo material as they grow. Upon closure of the isolation membranes, autophagosomes are formed within which the cargo is isolated from the rest of the cytoplasm. Subsequently, the autophagosomes fuse with the endolysosomal system where the inner membrane and the cargo are eventually degraded\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Kraft and Martens, 2012</a>)."

Atg19 acts during the transport of the oligomeric prApe1 peptidase and other cargos into the vacuole (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hutchins and Klionsky, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Scott et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Suzuki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yuga et al., 2011</a>). Within the vacuole, prApe1 becomes activated and fulfills its enzymatic function. Under basal, nutrient-rich conditions, the prApe1 oligomers are constitutively transported into the vacuole by the cytoplasm-to-vacuole\u00a0transport (Cvt) pathway (<a href=\"#bib24\">Klionsky et al., 1992</a>), in which small double membrane-bound vesicles, called Cvt vesicles, tightly enclose the prApe1 cargo (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baba et al., 1997</a>). The formation of these Cvt vesicles depends on the core autophagic machinery (<a href=\"#bib10\">Harding et al., 1995</a>)\u00a0and it is mechanistically analogous to the formation of selective autophagosomes in complex eukaryotes, including mammals (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lynch-Day and Klionsky, 2010</a>).

We asked whether this feature is conserved and turned our attention to p62, which is a major cargo receptor in mammals, including humans. Only a single LIR motif has been identified in p62 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ichimura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Pankiv et al., 2007</a>),\u00a0but there was the possibility that low-affinity-binding sites for ATG8 family proteins such as LC3B and GABARAP were not detected in classical pull-down assays since they fail to detect interactions with high off-rates. We, therefore, used a more sensitive assay to find potential p62\u2013LC3B interaction sites that are independent of the known LIR motif. To this end, we attached GFP-labeled LC3B or GABARAP to the membrane of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Recombinant mCherry-p62 was added to the GFP-LC3B and GFP-GABARAP-coated GUVs and the recruitment of mCherry-p62 was followed by spinning disk microscopy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). mCherry-p62 was robustly recruited to GFP-LC3B\u00a0and GFP-GABARAP but not to GFP-coated GUVs. Upon simultaneous mutation of D335, D336, D337, and W338 to A in the LIR motif of p62 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ichimura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Pankiv et al., 2007</a>), the recruitment of the protein to the GFP-LC3B and GFP-GABARAP-coated GUVs was completely abolished (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), strongly suggesting that p62 has only one functional LC3B/GABARAP interaction site.

Within the p62 oligomers, LIR motifs are clustered, similar to the occurrence of multiple Atg8 binding sites in the Atg19 cargo receptor (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, the PB1 domain was shown to enhance LC3B binding in pull-down experiments (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bj\u00f8rk\u00f8y et al., 2005</a>). To directly test whether the strength of the p62\u2013LC3B interaction correlates with the\u00a0ability of p62 to oligomerize, we recombinantly expressed and purified several oligomerization mutants of p62. The attachment of mCherry to the N-terminus of p62 considerably increased the yield of soluble protein. In order to determine the oligomerization state of our mCherry-p62 variants, we conducted size exclusion chromatography (SEC) runs coupled to static light scattering (SLS) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This allowed us to determine the molecular mass of the p62 variants independently of their\u00a0shape. The wild-type\u00a0and LIR mutant proteins eluted in the exclusion volumes (<i>V</i><sub>0</sub>) of the column. SLS showed that the protein in the <i>V</i><sub>0\u00a0</sub>was composed of\u00a0oligomeric particles of on average 24 molecules. Deletion of the PB1 domain resulted in a complete shift of the protein from the <i>V</i><sub>0</sub> to lower molecular weight fractions.

Employing the p62 pelleting assay ([<a href=\"#bib3\">Ciuffa et al., 2015</a>] and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>), we tested the effect of linear, K48- and K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin chains on the oligomerization of p62. All three chain types had a measurable effect on the oligomerization of p62 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). This effect was specific as GST did not disrupt p62 oligomers. Consistent with previous experiments (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ciuffa et al., 2015</a>), we did also not detect any effect of LC3B on the oligomerization of p62 [<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>]. Addition of K48-linked ubiquitin chains had the strongest disruptive effect on p62 oligomerization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Together with the fact that these chains were not preferentially bound by oligomeric p62 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) this suggests that p62 oligomers may be locally disrupted upon binding to the beads cross-linked with K48-linked ubiquitin chains."

Thus, even though linear ubiquitin chains disrupt p62 oligomers to some\u00a0extent in a concentration-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>), they are still bound\u00a0stronger than mono-ubiquitin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). We then went on to study whether lower off-rates contribute to the stronger binding of the wild-type protein to linear tetra-ubiquitin compared to mono-ubiquitin. Indeed, FRAP analysis of wild-type mCherry-p62 bound to mono-ubiquitin and linear tetra-ubiquitin showed that the recovery rate was higher for mono-ubiquitin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Lowering the density of mono-ubiquitin on the beads also resulted in increased FRAP recovery rates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>), similarly to what we observed for LC3B (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). These results suggested that oligomerization of p62 results in clustering of the ubiquitin-binding UBA domain and thus avid binding to surface-localized, clustered ubiquitin, analogous to the interaction with surface-localized LC3B (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). To directly test whether oligomerization of p62 confers more avid interaction with ubiquitin on surfaces, we measured the decay of mCherry-p62 wild-type or delta PB1 from ubiquitin-coated beads upon dilution in buffer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K,L</a>). Both proteins showed some degree of dissociation from the surface of the\u00a0beads but the oligomeric wild-type\u00a0p62 remained more stably bound."

We, therefore, asked what the consequences of the simultaneous interaction of p62 with ubiquitin and LC3B would be in the context of membrane-localized LC3B and ubiquitin localized to a surface. First, we asked whether p62 actually possesses the ability to simultaneously interact with LC3B and ubiquitin. To this end, we conducted experiments using GST-di-ubiquitin-coated beads to indirectly recruit\u00a0GFP-LC3B via p62 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). First, the\u00a0recruitment of mCherry-p62 variants to GST-di-ubiquitin-coated beads recapitulated our results with GFP-mono-ubiquitin (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, black bars, with <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We next assessed the ability of the p62 variants to recruit GFP-LC3B to the beads. No significant difference between wild-type\u00a0p62 and the K7A/D69A mutant was observed, while p62 delta PB1 and the NBR1-p62 chimera recruited significantly less LC3B (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, gray bars). However, when the GFP-LC3B signal is normalized to the corresponding mCherry-p62 signal, the\u00a0non-oligomerizing mutants appear to be about twice as efficient as p62 wild-type\u00a0in recruiting GFP-LC3B (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This mirrors the results we obtained when we directly tethered mCherry-p62 to RFP-TRAP beads (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

To this end, we adapted a previously described assay that is based on the coating of small latex beads with transfection reagent ([<a href=\"#bib25\">Kobayashi et al., 2010</a>]\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Upon internalization of the beads by the cell, the transfection reagent damages the endosomal membrane, which then becomes a target for\u00a0selective autophagy (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kobayashi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Thurston et al., 2012</a>). In order to render the beads themselves a direct target for selective autophagy, we coated them with recombinant TagBFP-ubiquitin before coating with transfection reagent (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). TagBFP-ubiquitin-coated beads were then added to HeLa cells that had the endogenous p62 protein\u00a0downregulated by RNAi (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and that were co-transfected with mCherry-p62 and GFP-LC3B. Extracellular beads were stained using an anti-ubiquitin antibody allowing us to count only the intracellular beads (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). mCherry-p62 wild\u2013type\u00a0was robustly recruited to the TagBFP-ubiquitin-coated beads (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). The ability of the p62 mutants to associate with the beads strongly correlated with their ability to oligomerize (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). While the non-oligomeric delta PB1 mutant and the NBR1-p62 chimera showed almost no recruitment above the experimental background (mCherry), the K7A/D69A mutant was still recruited to a considerable degree (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). To follow the recruitment of LC3B to the beads, we\u00a0quantified the number of beads that were positive for both mCherry-p62 and GFP-LC3B (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,F</a>). The recruitment of GFP-LC3B to the beads was also strongly dependent on the ability of p62 to oligomerize. Wild-type p62 showed robust recruitment of LC3B to the beads while p62 delta PB1 and the NBR1-p62 chimera showed very low LC3B recruitment. The p62 K7A/D69A mutant displayed an intermediate behavior\u00a0between the two extremes with regard to LC3B recruitment. Moreover, we noticed that the effect of the oligomerization on the LC3B recruitment to the beads was largely dependent on the reduced recruitment of the p62 oligomerization mutant. This became obvious when we quantified the total recruitment of LC3B to all intracellular beads, regardless of whether they were positive or negative for p62 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). This quantification showed that there is at least one redundant factor that is able to recruit LC3B to the ubiquitin-coated beads. This redundant factor accounts for 68% of the LC3B recruitment activity (compare wild-type p62\u00a0to mCherry). Obvious candidates for this factor are other cargo receptors such as NBR1\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Kirkin et al., 2009</a>), optineurin (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wild et al., 2011</a>), or Tollip (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). However, within the dynamic range of our assay for p62 recruitment activity, the p62 oligomerization mutants showed a profound loss of LC3B recruitment."

                        "text": "In this study, we have shown that the human cargo receptor p62 employs oligomerization to generate high-avidity interactions with ubiquitin and LC3B. Thus, oligomerization enables p62 to simultaneously select for concentrated ubiquitin and LC3B (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). There are interesting parallels but also deviations compared to the yeast Atg19 cargo receptor. Atg19 binds its prApe1 cargo with very high affinity and selects for membrane-bound Atg8 via a high-avidity interaction mediated by multiple low-affinity Atg8 interaction sites (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</a>). These properties are advantageous because the prApe1 cargo is a dedicated selective autophagic cargo that needs to be delivered into the vacuole in order to fulfill its function (<a href=\"#bib24\">Klionsky et al., 1992</a>). Thus, the high-affinity interaction of Atg19 with the prApe1 cargo ensures its rapid transport into the vacuole. The multiple Atg8 binding sites in Atg19 subsequently mediate the selective interaction with membrane localized, locally concentrated Atg8, enabling Atg19 to bend the membrane tightly around the cargo and to exclude non-cargo material from its delivery into the vacuole (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baba et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, the cargo of p62 is not normally destined to be transported into the lysosomal system but fulfills a function in the cell\u2019s cytoplasm. Only when this material becomes dysfunctional or superfluous\u00a0it becomes marked with ubiquitin and thereby\u00a0a target for selective autophagy. Aggregated proteins, for example, are a cargo for p62\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Bj\u00f8rk\u00f8y et al., 2005</a>). However, when cytosolic proteins unfold and aggregate, they initially become a target for the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). When the UPS is overwhelmed, unfolded, ubiquitinated proteins form aggregates\u00a0on which ubiquitin is locally concentrated. Only these structures should become a target for p62 and subsequently be\u00a0degraded by selective autophagy. The low affinity but high avidity interaction of the p62 oligomer with ubiquitin will select for these structures as ubiquitin is locally concentrated\u00a0on them (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Interestingly, we found that K48-linked ubiquitin chains are less efficiently bound by oligomeric p62 compared to linear and K63-linked chains, possibly because K48-linked ubiquitin chains disrupt the p62 oligomers more effectively. These results hint to the possibility that K48-linked chains are not the preferred target for p62 in vivo, possibly in order to prevent proteins targeted for the proteasome to become premature targets of p62. Thus aggregated proteins may need further modification by K63-linked or linear ubiquitin chains in order to render them efficient targets for p62."

Contrary to Atg19, a substrate adaptor with multiple LIR motifs, p62 contains only a single LIR-motif and a single UBA-domain. This study suggests that oligomerization provides p62 with multiple LIR-motifs and UBA domains within a single structure, probably related to the large helical structures previously described by cryo-EM. Oligomerization decreases the off-rate of cargo from the adaptor, thus stabilizing the interaction of adaptor and cargo sufficiently for membrane formation around the cargo. In addition, the simultaneous binding of p62 to ubiquitin and LC3 allows for bending of the autophagosomal membrane around cargo, at least in the context of GUVs. There is also some correlation between in vitro data and recognition of ubiquitylated Salmonella by p62."

However, this study is mostly done in the context of mono- or di-ubiquitin, and linkage-specificity of ubiquitin conjugates is not taken into account. It is important to address both length and linkage of the ubiquitin conjugates as previous work had suggested that long ubiquitin chains (octamers connected through K63) can disrupt the oligomeric structure of p62. Thus, some of these assays need to be repeated with defined K63- or K48-linked chains of at least four ubiquitin molecules tested for their interaction with p62 and their ability to induce membrane bending in conjunction with p62."

Are all components required for bending the membrane or that an interaction between the beads and the membrane could be sufficient to drive the curvature? The authors may need to demonstrate a physiological circumstance which requires ubiquitin, oligomerized p62 and LC3 to bend the membrane. Could the p62-coated beads bend the LC3-coated membrane? In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, the data shown do not support the statistical significance of the claim that \"The oligomerization deficient mutants of p62 showed reduced ability to mediate membrane bending (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>).\" The authors show that PB1-mediated oligomerization is important for avid binding to Ub, but their results do not support the idea it is a direct driving force for membrane bending."

However, this study is mostly done in the context of mono- or di-ubiquitin, and linkage-specificity of ubiquitin conjugates is not taken into account. It is important to address both length and linkage of the ubiquitin conjugates as previous work had suggested that long ubiquitin chains (octamers connected through K63) can disrupt the oligomeric structure of p62. Thus, some of these assays need to be repeated with defined K63- or K48-linked chains of at least four ubiquitin molecules tested for their interaction with p62 and their ability to induce membrane bending in conjunction with p62.</i> "

We have now tested the interaction of wild type p62 and the non-oligomeric delta PB1 mutant with beads cross-linked to linear tetra-ubiquitin, K48-linked tetra-ubiquitin and K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Interestingly, while the delta-PB1 mutant bound equally to all three chain types, the oligomeric wild type protein showed increased binding to linear ubiquitin and to some extent to K63-linked ubiquitin chains but not to K48-linked ubiquitin. When we tested the oligomer disruption activity of the three chain types we found that K48-linked ubiquitin chains had the strongest effect on oligomerization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Thus it appears that K48-linked ubiquitin chains may not be the preferred target for oligomeric p62. We further tested the effect of ubiquitin chain length on p62 binding using mono-ubiquitin and linear di- and tetra-ubiquitin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Both, wild type and p62 delta PB1 bound stronger to longer chain types but the positive effect of the increasing chain length was more pronounced for the oligomeric wild type protein. This was despite the fact that at high concentrations linear ubiquitin chains have a considerable disruptive effect on p62 oligomerization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). We then went on to test the dissociation of p62 from mono-ubiquitin and linear tetra-ubiquitin using FRAP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>) and found that p62 is much more tightly bound (i.e. has a lower off rate) to tetra-ubiquitin chains than to mono-ubiquitin. Increasing the density of mono-ubiquitin on the beads also resulted in reduced off-rates of p62 from the beads (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). Thus a major factor for the avid binding of oligomeric p62 to ubiquitinated structures is the density of ubiquitin rather than the existence of chains, although chains could still have an additive positive effect. We also tested the ability of wild type p62 to bend the membrane of GUVs around beads coated with linear tetra-ubiquitin, K48-linked tetra-ubiquitin and K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). We found that p62 mediated membrane bending for all three chain types. Consistent with weaker interaction of p62 with K48-linked chains bending was less efficient for this chain type."

In addition, this experiment shows that oligomerization is also not essential for membrane bending (although it could of course have an additive positive effect). Thus oligomerization may primarily mediate the accumulation of p62 at the ubiquitinated cargo, which in turn clusters the LIR motifs allowing the bending of the LC3B-coated membrane.

Thus wild type p62 binds very strongly to the membrane via its interaction with LC3B (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>) and the beads via its interaction with ubiquitin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This means that the protein will cover both surfaces and due to the practically irreversible nature of these interactions the interaction of the beads with the membrane are mediated by p62-p62 interactions. In contrast, the oligomerization deficient mutants are less tightly bound to the membrane and the beads and thus are likely to exchange and therefore to be able to mediate simultaneous interaction with LC3B and ubiquitin. We came to the conclusion that we are not comparing the same phenomenon for the different p62 variants. Therefore we have changed the experimental setup by pre-incubating linear tetra-ubiquitin coupled beads with p62 followed by their addition to GUVs coated with LC3B (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This experiment shows that p62 is able to bend the membrane around the beads and that this activity is significantly reduced for the delta PB1 mutant."
