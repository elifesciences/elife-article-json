A parsimonious model for generation of convergence sites is that cell polarity for the auxin transporter PIN1 orients up auxin gradients, as this spontaneously generates convergent alignments. Here we test predictions of this and other models for the patterns of auxin biosynthesis and import. Live imaging of outgrowths from <i>kanadi1 kanadi2 Arabidopsis</i> mutant leaves shows that they arise by formation of PIN1 convergence sites within a proximodistal polarity field. PIN1 polarities are oriented away from regions of high auxin biosynthesis enzyme expression, and towards regions of high auxin importer expression. Both expression patterns are required for normal outgrowth emergence, and may form part of a common module underlying shoot outgrowths. These findings are more consistent with models that spontaneously generate tandem rather than convergent alignments."

A parsimonious model for generation of convergence sites is that cell polarity for the auxin transporter PIN1 orients up auxin gradients, as this spontaneously generates convergent alignments. Here we test predictions of this and other models for the patterns of auxin biosynthesis and import. Live imaging of outgrowths from <i>kanadi1 kanadi2 Arabidopsis</i> mutant leaves shows that they arise by formation of PIN1 convergence sites within a proximodistal polarity field. PIN1 polarities are oriented away from regions of high auxin biosynthesis enzyme expression, and towards regions of high auxin importer expression. Both expression patterns are required for normal outgrowth emergence, and may form part of a common module underlying shoot outgrowths. These findings are more consistent with models that spontaneously generate tandem rather than convergent alignments."

New leaves and flowers are made from outgrowths that constantly form at the tip of growing shoots. Groups of cells in the outer layer of the shoot tip arrange a protein called PIN1 so that it is more abundant on the cell surfaces that face towards the centre of the group. PIN1 transports a hormone called auxin out of plant cells and this \u201cconvergent\u201d arrangement of PIN1 increases the levels of auxin in cells at the centre of the group, leading to the formation of a new outgrowth. However, it is not clear what causes these cells to position their PIN1 proteins in this way."

For example, according to the \u201cup-the-gradient\u201d hypothesis, PIN1 is allocated to the end of a cell that is next to a cell with a higher level of auxin. Abley et al. have now compared predictions from computer models with new experimental data from a plant called <i>Arabidopsis</i> to evaluate three hypotheses for how convergent PIN1 patterns form. A computer model based on the up-the-gradient hypothesis naturally creates convergent PIN1 patterns, even if each cell starts off with the same level of auxin. On the other hand, models based on two other hypotheses generate tandem alignments of PIN1 so that auxin is transported in the same direction along lines of cells."

These outgrowths form in a similar way to outgrowths at the growing shoot tip, but in a simpler context. The experiments show that the patterns of where auxin is produced in growing leaves were more compatible with the tandem alignment models than the up-the-gradient model. This suggests that plants use a tandem alignment mechanism to form convergences of PIN1 proteins that generate the local increases in auxin needed to make new outgrowths."

Shoot apical meristems produce leaf primordia, which in turn provide the setting for the initiation of new outgrowths such as serrations and leaflets. A common developmental module has been proposed to underlie the generation of both leaves and leaf-derived outgrowths (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barkoulas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hay et al., 2006</a>). A key feature of the module is an epidermal site of high intracellular auxin, located at the centre of convergence of the polarised auxin efflux carrier, PIN1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barkoulas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Benkov\u00e1 et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hay et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Reinhardt et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Scarpella et al., 2006</a>)."

This mechanism is parsimonious because it can spontaneously generate spaced centres of polarity convergence without additional assumptions about the presence of auxin sources or sinks. Molecular mechanisms accounting for up-the-gradient behaviour have been proposed to involve detection of auxin-induced stress gradients (<a href=\"#bib23\">Heisler et al., 2010</a>) or auxin transport sensing (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cieslak et al., 2015</a>)."

A possible molecular mechanism for how cells might sense auxin flux has recently been proposed (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cieslak et al., 2015</a>). Although originally proposed to account for venation patterns, this flux-based model has also been shown to be compatible with the patterns of epidermal PIN1 polarity in the vegetative shoot apical meristem (<a href=\"#bib47\">Stoma et al., 2008</a>). Polarity convergence formation can be accounted for by assuming that sub-epidermal pro-vascular PIN1 strands are induced in regions of elevated auxin and cause a local depletion of auxin from the epidermis. This depletion causes PIN1 polarities to reorient and generate a site of convergence, which then raises auxin levels at its centre through transport. A problem with this model is that it predicts a transient drop in intracellular auxin concentration during early stages of convergence formation, which is not supported experimentally (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brunoud et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Heisler et al., 2005</a>)."

Instead, the indirect coupling model involves intracellular polarity components that can establish cell polarity without external asymmetries in auxin distribution (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abley et al., 2013</a>). The two polarity components each exist in two forms: a diffusible cytoplasmic form (A and B) and a more slowly diffusing membrane bound form (A* and B*). Interactions between the components leads to A* and B* being localised at opposite ends of the cell. PIN1 is recruited to the membrane by one of the components (A*), causing a polarised PIN1 distribution. Polarities of neighbouring cells are coupled indirectly through a feedback mechanism in which extracellular auxin inhibits A* and thus PIN1 accumulation. This model results in polarities being oriented away from regions of high extracellular auxin and towards regions with low extracellular auxin. It can generate coordinated polarities for a field of cells, but it is unclear whether it can generate centres of PIN1 convergence."

These outgrowths can be considered as intermediates between leaf primordia and serrations. Similar to leaf primordia, the outgrowths emerge perpendicular to the main plane of the tissue, and like serrations, they are derived from the leaf. Because of their emergence from the abaxial lamina which can be readily imaged, these outgrowths are more amenable to time-lapse imaging than serrations which are often obscured by neighbouring cotyledon tissue and curving of the leaf edge. <i>kan1kan2</i> outgrowths have elevated intracellular auxin at their tips, and their formation depends on specific patterns of auxin biosynthetic enzyme expression (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). They provide a test bed for studying convergence site formation in a starting context which, unlike the apex, is not complicated by the prior patterns of continual primordium initiation. However, the dynamics of auxin accumulation, PIN1 polarity and expression of auxin biosynthesis genes at early stages of <i>kan1kan2</i> outgrowth emergence have not been described. Moreover, the role of <i>CUC</i> genes, needed for formation of primordia and serrations (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nikovics et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">Aida et al., 1997</a>) has not been determined."

These convergent polarities arise within the context of an initial proximo-distal PIN1 polarity field and are promoted by <i>CUC2</i> activity. An exploration of model behaviours reveals that models may be classified into two types: those that spontaneously generate convergent aligments (e.g. the up-the-gradient) and those that spontaneously generate tandem alignments (e.g. flux-based and indirect coupling). Both types of model can account for the generation of an initial proximo-distal polarity field, followed by the formation of convergences with elevated intracellular auxin. However, unlike the convergent alignment model, tandem alignment models require the appearance of local regions with elevated auxin import. In support of tandem alignment models, we show that expression of the <i>LAX1</i> auxin importer is elevated in regions of polarity convergence at the tips of <i>kan1kan2</i> outgrowths, and that <i>AUX/LAX</i> importer genes are required for normal <i>kan1kan2</i> outgrowth development. Additionally, we show that expression of YUCCA1 and YUCCA4 auxin biosynthetic enzymes tends to be elevated in regions of polarity divergence in <i>kan1kan2</i> and WT leaves, an observation which is also most readily consistent with tandem alignment models. Thus, tandem alignment models provide parsimonious explanations for the developmental module underlying outgrowth emergence."

Here we focus on PIN1 since this is the predominant epidermally expressed PIN that shows polar intracellular distributions in wild-type leaves (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guenot et al., 2012</a>). In young <i>kan1kan2</i> leaf primordia, the epidermal PIN1 polarity pattern was similar to that observed in WT: PIN1 polarities were oriented towards the leaf tip in both cases (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). At later stages of development, WT leaves retained a proximo-distal polarity pattern, and then no-longer showed detectable expression of the <i>PIN1::PIN1:GFP</i> reporter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The loss of <i>PIN1::PIN1:GFP</i> expression did not occur uniformly throughout the WT leaf because some patches of cells retained expression for longer than other regions of the leaf (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A iii</a>). By contrast to WT, <i>kan1kan2</i> leaves maintained PIN1 expression until later stages of development and formed centres of PIN1 polarity convergence, located at the tips of emerging ectopic outgrowths (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u00a0iv and C\u00a0iv</a>). Cells at the centres of convergence had highly polarised PIN1, oriented towards the interface between three or four neighbouring cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u00a0iv</a>). To determine whether the centres of convergence preceded outgrowth emergence, leaves were imaged over several days and cell lineages that gave rise to convergences traced back through the time-course of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, yellow dots, arrows and lines). This revealed that cells closest to the centre of convergence at the outgrowth tip descended from one or two cells, which were already at a centre of polarity convergence prior to outgrowth emergence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Taken together, these findings show that, prior to <i>kan1kan2</i> outgrowth emergence, centres of polarity convergence develop within a proximodistally oriented polarity field."

In this model, we also represent cell membranes and walls with several compartments per cell edge (allowing lateral diffusion of components to be simulated).

However, to get a clearer view of the properties of each model, we begin by considering a group of cells having initially uniform auxin concentration and PIN1 distribution, and with only the central cell having the ability to relocate its PIN1 according to the rules specified by each model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). We find that the central cell becomes polarised with both the up-the-gradient and flux-based models, assuming that there are small random fluctuations (noise) in the initial concentrations of PIN1 in the cell membranes and that auxin flux from the central cell can modify the initially homogeneous auxin concentration in the neighbouring tissue (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a>). In the up-the-gradient model, a cell edge with elevated PIN1 causes an increase in auxin concentration in the neighbouring cell. This elevated auxin concentration in the neighbour feeds back to cause an increase in PIN1 allocation to the cell edge (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u00a0ii</a>, purple arrow). Assuming a limited pool of PIN1 in the cell, there will be a corresponding reduction in PIN1 allocation to other cell edges. In the flux-based model polarity arises because if one cell edge has slightly elevated PIN1 (due to small random fluctuations), this edge will have a higher rate of auxin efflux, which feeds back to favour further recruitment of PIN1 to the given cell edge (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u00a0ii</a>, purple arrow). Recruitment of PIN1 to other cell edges is inhibited because the different edges of a cell compete to export auxin into surrounding cells."

There is, however, a key difference between the up-the-gradient and other models. If auxin concentration in the surrounding medium remains fixed throughout the simulation (equivalent to voltage-clamping in neurophysiology), then the up-the-gradient model does not generate polarity (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The above simulations show that this distinction needs to be taken into account to appreciate that, whereas the flux-based model can present intracellular partitioning (i.e. establish polarity in the absence of asymmetric cues or polarisable neighbours), the up-the-gradient model relies on its ability to change its surrounding to establish and maintain polarization. Thus, both the flux-based and up-the-gradient model share commonalities with the indirect coupling model regarding intracellular partitioning, albeit through a more indirect mechanism involving auxin transport between cells."

For a proximodistal polarity field to be maintained within the growing primordium, the convergent alignment model requires maintenance of an increasing auxin concentration gradient from the leaf base to the leaf tip. One way this can be achieved is through net auxin removal at the leaf base. Net auxin removal from a region of tissue could be achieved through a decreased rate of auxin biosynthesis, an increased rate of transport away from the region, or an increased rate of auxin degradation or conjugation. Here net removal is achieved using elevated auxin degradation rates (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Combining this assumption with an initially elevated intracellular auxin concentration at the leaf tip, a proximodistal polarity field can be maintained within an array. The intracellular auxin concentration is kept high at the distal end of the array through transport towards this region (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), similar to experimental observations using the <i>DR5::GFP</i> reporter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">Mattsson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Scarpella et al., 2006</a>). As the primordium increases in size (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), the auxin concentration tends to become shallow at a distance from the leaf tip. This can result in the spontaneous formation of a centre of convergence with elevated intracellular auxin within the proximal region of the lamina (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), similar to that observed in <i>kan1kan2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). The length of the tissue at which the polarity reversal occurs depends on the parameters values used in the model. The failure to form such a convergence centre in WT leaves could be explained by the PIN1 polarity pattern becoming fixed at early stages of development, preventing polarity reorientation. However, how this could be achieved is unclear, although it has been proposed that absence of <i>CUC2</i> activity may play a role in fixing polarity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bilsborough et al., 2011</a>)."

Thus, with tandem alignment models, further assumptions are needed to generate centres of PIN1 polarity convergence.

In the tandem\u00a0alignment models, auxin biosynthesis in this region leads to a shallow peak in intracellular auxin proximal to the distal limit of auxin biosynthesis (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,C</a>). This peak arises as a consequence of elevated auxin biosynthesis in this domain, together with polarised transport which shifts the position of the peak distally. If intracellular auxin above a threshold concentration activates auxin import, a region with elevated import arises, leading to a centre of polarity convergence (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B,D</a>). Elevated auxin removal needs to arise in addition to elevated auxin import since import alone causes very high levels of intracellular auxin to accumulate at the centre of convergence. This can disrupt convergence formation by preventing the maintenance of low extracellular auxin (in the indirect coupling model), and by increasing total auxin efflux from the central cell (in the flux-based model).

To determine the contribution of <i>lax2</i> and <i>lax3</i> to the loss of outgrowths, <i>kan1kan2aux1lax1</i> quadruple and <i>kan1kan2aux1lax1lax2</i> quintuple mutants were also generated. Loss of function of <i>aux1</i> and <i>lax1</i> alone caused a reduction in the number of outgrowths compared with <i>kan1kan2</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11G</a>). This reduction was further increased by a loss of <i>LAX2</i> activity (<i>kan1kan2aux1lax1lax2</i> mutants have a further loss of outgrowths [<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11G</a>]). Since <i>LAX2::GUS</i> expression was only detected in sub-epidermal tissue, this finding supports a role of sub-epidermal auxin importer expression in the generation of outgrowths. <i>LAX2</i>-mediated sub-epidermal auxin import below centres of convergence could contribute to removal of auxin from the centre of convergence. Despite the absence of <i>LAX3::GUS</i> reporter expression in leaves, loss of <i>LAX3</i> caused a further reduction in the number of outgrowths (<i>kan1kan2aux1lax1lax2</i> mutants generated more outgrowths than <i>kan1kan2aux1lax1lax2lax3</i> mutants, [<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11G</a>]). This suggests that <i>LAX3</i> may function redundantly with other members of the <i>AUX/LAX</i> family in the generation of ectopic outgrowths, or that differences in genetic background between the multiple mutants has an effect on outgrowth frequency (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods)."

In its most parsimonious form, there is no need for elevated auxin import at the leaf tip or at subsequent centres of convergence with the convergent alignment model (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). However, this does not make the model incompatible with elevated auxin import at these sites. If it is assumed that intracellular auxin above a threshold concentration induces elevated auxin import and removal, elevated import and removal may be induced after convergence formation (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11H</a>). This does not cause disruption of the centres of convergence. Distally oriented polarities near the leaf tip may also be achieved if these cells have an elevated rate of auxin import and removal (rather than an elevated initial auxin concentration) (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11H</a>).

Assuming all cells in a tissue have an equal capacity to import and export auxin, cells with elevated intracellular auxin concentration will have higher net rates of auxin flux away from them, into neighbouring cells.

However, auxin removal alone, through formation of sub-epidermal PIN1 strands (<a href=\"#bib47\">Stoma et al., 2008</a>) would lead to a transient dip in epidermal auxin concentrations, which is not observed experimentally (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brunoud et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Heisler et al., 2005</a>). Here,\u00a0in the simulations we present, the transient dip does not occur if centres of convergence have elevated auxin import in addition to removal. The observed elevated levels of auxin import at convergence centres (feature 4) is therefore an expected feature for tandem alignment models. A functional role for auxin import is also supported by the observed disruption of outgrowth initiation in <i>aux1lax1lax2lax3</i> meristems (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bainbridge et al., 2008</a>) and <i>kan1kan2aux1lax1lax2lax3</i> leaves. A further property of tandem alignment models is that polarities tend to become oriented away from auxin sources. It is therefore expected that sites of divergent polarity, such as the axillary regions of outgrowths would be auxin sources, compatible with elevated expression of auxin biosynthesis enzymes in these regions (feature 3). Also supporting these predictions of tandem alignment models, loss of ectopic auxin biosynthesis and import in the <i>kan1kan2cuc2</i> mutant correlates with a loss of PIN1 convergence points and ectopic outgrowths."

According to the convergent alignment model, CUC2 may be required to enable PIN1 polarity to become reoriented rather than remaining fixed in the abaxial lamina as occurs in wild\u00a0type (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bilsborough et al., 2011</a>). According to the tandem alignment models, ectopic expression of <i>CUC2</i> could drive auxin synthesis (YUCCA expression) and induction of ectopic sites of elevated auxin import and removal, and thus centres of convergence. <i>CUC2</i> expression distal to the outgrowth could also maintain these regions as sites of high auxin synthesis and polarity divergence."

All plant models tested can generate cell polarity without a polarising environment, whilst animal models except the direct coupling model ([4] [<a href=\"#bib1\">Abley et al., 2013</a>]) either require an asymmetric signal ([1] [<a href=\"#bib29\">Le Garrec et al., 2006</a>]\u00a0[2]\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib3\">Amonlirdviman, 2005</a>]) or polarisable neighbours ([3]\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib11\">Burak and Shraiman, 2009</a>]) for cell polarity to arise. A further classification is made according to the behaviours of groups of cells in the absence of pre-established asymmetries. In this context, the indirect coupling ([5]\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib1\">Abley et al., 2013</a>]) and flux-based ([6]\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib33\">Mitchison, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rolland-Lagan and\u00a0Prusinkiewicz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Stoma et al., 2008</a>]) models of plant polarity generate swirled patterns of polarity with tandem alignments between cells.

The stress-based model of PIN1 polarity ([8] [<a href=\"#bib23\">Heisler et al., 2010</a>]) also fits in the convergent alignment category as it generates similar behaviours with respect to auxin concentrations to the up-the-gradient model. The animal models that are capable of polarising in the absence of pre-established asymmetries generate tandem alignments of polarities ([4] direct coupling model [<a href=\"#bib1\">Abley et al., 2013</a>], and (3) <a href=\"#bib11\">Burak and Shraiman, 2009</a>)."

One is through small fluctuations in polarity leading to altered auxin distribution or flux which then feeds back to enhance polarity. This occurs in the up-the-gradient and flux-based models (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a> [<a href=\"#bib51\">van Berkel et al., 2013</a>]). It contrasts with current animal models in which polarity does not feed back to influence the distribution of the extracellular ligand. Another class of plant models proposes that cells become polarised without requirement for altered distribution or flux of auxin, through processes internal to the cell, as assumed for indirect coupling (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). It remains to be seen whether the indirect coupling model can also capture the generation of sub-epidermal strands of cells with elevated levels of membrane-localised PIN1 (feature 5). Such strands are observed experimentally during pro-vascular development and can be accounted for with a flux-based model assuming superlinear feedback between flux and PIN1 allocation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Scarpella et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bayer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rolland-Lagan\u00a0and\u00a0Prusinkiewicz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Feugier et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Stoma et al., 2008</a>)."

However, models may differ in the predictions they make prior to the data being obtained, and the parsimony with which experimental data can be accounted for. Moreover some models may make very similar predictions even though underlying molecular mechanisms are different. For example, two types of tandem alignment model - flux-based and indirect coupling - give similar predictions for auxin import and synthesis. Similarly, a concentration-based or stress-based version of the convergent alignment model gives similar predictions for auxin turnover. Other types of experiment will be needed to discriminate between these further levels of explanation."

The most widely accepted model, the \"up-the-gradient\" model, is also the most parsimonious explanation as it spontaneously generates convergent PIN transporter alignments. Based on recent literature, suggesting that regulated auxin import and new auxin biosynthesis must also be involved, the authors looked at the ability of current models to predict sites of new leaf outgrowths. In a combination of methodologies that include both experiments and computer simulations, the authors challenge the simple model and conclude that less parsimonious models, (\"flux model\" or \"indirect cell-cell coupling\" model), make predictions that better explain the data."

The time-lapse images are stunning, and I generally agree with the interpretation (with the exclusion of Figure 11B3). The Meyerowitz lab's \"up-the gradient\" model has dominated the discussion for 8 years, and I think it's time for us to consider some new ideas. Thus, I am in favor of publishing this paper. That said, some other new data has emerged in the past 8 years, in addition to the information on auxin import and auxin biosynthesis. As an example, PIN1 can localize to a side of a cell, but it is only an active transporter when it's phosphorylated by PID or one of its paralogs or one of the D6PKs. A second example is the use of <i>kan1 kan2</i> double mutant, which makes mixed tissue outgrowths ectopically that are best predicted by tandem alignment models. Why not just look at areas of serration? The authors imaged only epidermal tissue. Why not other layers?"

The data set mostly comprises time course observations of pertinent markers, at the same time taking advantage of the unusual laminar outgrowth formation in <i>kanadi</i> mutants. From the simulations and their match with spatio-temporal maker expression, the authors conclude that the two \"tandem alignment\" models fit the data better than another model that has been proposed to explain convergence points. Specifically, the \"indirect coupling\" tandem alignment model proposed by the authors previously appears to fit the observations best. I am not a modeler and cannot judge the technical dimension of the simulations, but trust the authors and other reviewers are competent in this field.

The reason for our revision arose from the fact that no one had previously applied their models to simulate single polarisable cells surrounded by non-polarisable neighbours - all previous simulations considered cell arrays in which all cells are polarisable. When performing such simulations we found that all three models can generate polarity in an initially uniform field of auxin concentration. The polarity arises in the flux-based and up-the-gradient models because small fluctuations in PIN1 distribution create variations in auxin flux or concentrations that feed back to reinforce the polarity. We have now clarified the text in the subsection \u201cPIN1 polarity models can be classified into two groups with different behaviours\u201d to make our reasoning more explicit, and also pointed out a key difference between the up-the-gradient model and the other models. If auxin concentration in the medium surrounding a single polarisable cell remains fixed throughout the simulation (equivalent to voltage-clamping in neurophysiology), then the up-the-gradient model does not generate polarity (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Indirect coupling depends on a mechanism for sensing extracellular auxin concentration and ABP1 initially seemed like a reasonable candidate. We agree that recent data rules out ABP1 having this role, and like the other hypotheses (up-the-gradient, flux) the molecular players involved in sensing auxin levels or flux remain to be elucidated."
