                    "text": "As the major mechanism of plant growth and morphogenesis, cell elongation is controlled by many hormonal and environmental signals. How these signals are coordinated at the molecular level to ensure coherent cellular responses remains unclear. In this study, we illustrate a molecular circuit that integrates all major growth-regulating signals, including auxin, brassinosteroid, gibberellin, light, and temperature. Analyses of genome-wide targets, genetic and biochemical interactions demonstrate that the auxin-response factor ARF6, the light/temperature-regulated transcription factor PIF4, and the brassinosteroid-signaling transcription factor BZR1, interact with each other and cooperatively regulate large numbers of common target genes, but their DNA-binding activities are blocked by the gibberellin-inactivated repressor RGA. In addition, a tripartite HLH/bHLH module feedback regulates PIFs and additional bHLH factors that interact with ARF6, and thereby modulates auxin sensitivity according to developmental and environmental cues. Our results demonstrate a central growth-regulation circuit that integrates hormonal, environmental, and developmental controls of cell elongation in Arabidopsis hypocotyl."

How these signals are coordinated at the molecular level to ensure coherent cellular responses remains unclear. In this study, we illustrate a molecular circuit that integrates all major growth-regulating signals, including auxin, brassinosteroid, gibberellin, light, and temperature. Analyses of genome-wide targets, genetic and biochemical interactions demonstrate that the auxin-response factor ARF6, the light/temperature-regulated transcription factor PIF4, and the brassinosteroid-signaling transcription factor BZR1, interact with each other and cooperatively regulate large numbers of common target genes, but their DNA-binding activities are blocked by the gibberellin-inactivated repressor RGA. In addition, a tripartite HLH/bHLH module feedback regulates PIFs and additional bHLH factors that interact with ARF6, and thereby modulates auxin sensitivity according to developmental and environmental cues. Our results demonstrate a central growth-regulation circuit that integrates hormonal, environmental, and developmental controls of cell elongation in Arabidopsis hypocotyl."

Complex interplays among these signals have been observed at the genetic and physiological levels, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions are not fully understood. Recent studies have shown integration of the light, temperature, BR and GA pathways through direct interactions between their target transcription regulators (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gallego-Bartolome et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Oh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bai et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2012b</a>).

While regulation of auxin level and distribution is an important aspect of its function, the ability of auxin to regulate cell elongation also depends on developmental context and the status of other hormonal and environmental signals (<a href=\"#bib40\">Stewart and Nemhauser, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Del Bianco and Kepinski, 2011</a>). For example, auxin and brassinosteroid (BR) are known to be interdependent and show synergistic interactions in promoting hypocotyl elongation, and they induce highly overlapping transcriptional responses (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goda et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nemhauser et al., 2004</a>). Normal auxin response also requires another growth-promoting hormone gibberellin (GA) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chapman et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, both auxin level and sensitivity are modulated by light, temperature, and circadian rhythm, through the phytochrome-interacting factor (PIFs) family of bHLH transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib9\">Covington and Harmer, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nozue et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Koini et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Franklin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nozue et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hornitschek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sun et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2012a</a>). The mechanisms for regulation of auxin levels and distribution through metabolism and polar auxin transport have been studied extensively, however, little is known about direct interaction between the signal transduction pathways of auxin and other signals at the molecular level."

By contrast, BR acts through a receptor kinase pathway to inhibit BIN2/GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of the brassinazole resistant (BZR) family of transcription factors, leading to their accumulation in the nucleus and regulation of thousands of target genes (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Cross regulation between auxin and BR has been observed at several levels, including auxin activation of BR biosynthetic genes, BR regulation of the expression levels of auxin transporters (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bao et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mouchel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yoshimitsu et al., 2011</a>)<i>,</i> and BIN2 phosphorylation of ARF2 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Vert et al., 2008</a>). However, these cross regulation mechanisms appear insufficient to explain the mutual interdependence between BR and auxin. There has been evidence that both BZR2 (also named BES1) and ARF5 bind to the promoter of the auxin- and BR-activated <i>SAUR15</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib47\">Walcher and Nemhauser, 2012</a>). The functions of such interactions in the auxin-BR co-regulation of genome expression and cell elongation, however, remain unclear. Much less is known about direct interactions between auxin and the phytochrome or GA pathways. While recent studies demonstrated convergence of the BR, light, and GA pathways through interactions between PIF4, BZR1 and the GA-inactivated repressor DELLA proteins (<a href=\"#bib13\">Feng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">de Lucas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gallego-Bartolome et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Oh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bai et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2012b</a>), the current models suggest that auxin interacts with other signals mainly through modulation of hormone levels (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mouchel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Franklin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yoshimitsu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chapman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sun et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2012a</a>)."

Genetic and biochemical assays further demonstrate that these factors interact directly and bind to shared target genes cooperatively. Furthermore, the DELLA protein RGA interacts with ARF6 and blocks its DNA binding. Our study elucidates a central growth regulation circuit that explains how auxin, BR, GA, light, and temperature act together in regulating hypocotyl cell elongation and how the hormone sensitivities are modulated by environmental signals and developmental programs."

To define the genomic targets of auxin involved in hypocotyl cell elongation, we performed chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analysis of target genes of ARF6. An ARF6-Myc fusion protein was expressed from the <i>ARF6</i> promoter in transgenic <i>arf6-2;arf8-3</i> plants, and rescued the short-hypocotyl phenotype of the <i>arf6;arf8</i> double mutant (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). ChIP-Seq analysis using anti-Myc antibody identified 2037 ARF6-binding sites in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> genome. Most of the ARF6 binding sites were in the gene promoter regions consistent with its molecular function as a transcription regulator (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The 2037 binding sites were linked to 2675 neighbor genes (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1A</a>), which were considered ARF6 binding target genes. The ARF6 binding targets include 40 of the 49 early auxin-induced genes in the hypocotyl tissues after 30 min of auxin treatment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chapman et al., 2012</a>), but only 1 of the 16 immediate auxin-repressed genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Therefore, ARF6 appears to function mainly as a transcriptional activator, consistent with previous study (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tiwari et al., 2003</a>). Comparison with auxin-activated genes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chapman et al., 2012</a>) identified 255 ARF6 binding targets that are activated by auxin in the hypocotyl tissues.

Furthermore, the ARF6 binding regions having both AuxRE and E-box motifs were significantly more frequently associated with auxin-activated genes than binding regions having only AuxRE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Consistent with cis-elements clustering, the ARF6 targets shared by BZR1 and PIF4 had higher percentage of auxin-activated genes than the targets of ARF6 alone, and a higher percentage of BR-activated genes than genes that are targets of BZR1 only (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). Furthermore, the GA-activated genes and light-repressed genes were also highly enriched among the common targets of BZR1, PIF4 and ARF6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). These results suggest that the major growth signals\u2014auxin, BR, GA, and light\u2014converge at shared genomic target promoters containing combinatorial cis-elements for these factors."

Indeed, ARF6 directly interacted with both BZR1 and PIF4 through the C-terminal domain of BZR1 and the bHLH domain of PIF4 in the yeast two-hybrid assays (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>). Both the middle and C-terminal domains of ARF6 were required for the interactions with BZR1 and PIF4 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that ARF6 interacts with BZR1 and PIF4 in vivo (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In addition, the ARF6\u2013PIF4 interaction was increased by co-transfection with a gain-of-function bzr1-1D protein that is constitutively active irrespective of BR signaling (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), suggesting that BZR1\u2013PIF4 interaction enhances PIF4 interaction with ARF6. We next examined if BZR1 and PIF4 interact with other ARFs using yeast two-hybrid assays, and the results show that both BZR1 and PIF4 specifically interacted with ARF8, but not ARF1 and ARF7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that BZR1 and PIF4 mediate only subsets of auxin responses such as hypocotyl elongation by interacting with specific ARFs."

Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of selected genes, including <i>SAURs</i> (<i>SAUR15, SAUR26</i>), <i>ESPANSIN</i> (<i>EXP8</i>)<i>, PREs</i>, and <i>DWF4,</i> confirmed the patterns observed in the genome-wide analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Activation of the BR- and auxin-induced genes by <i>bzr1</i>-<i>1D</i> was abolished or diminished by <i>iaa3</i>, but the repression of BR-repressed <i>DWF4</i> expression was unaffected by <i>iaa3</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>).

If the effect of <i>iaa3</i> on BR responses is due to inactivation of ARFs, loss of the ARF functions would have a similar effect as <i>iaa3</i>.

The effect of <i>arf6;arf8</i> is similar to but weaker than <i>iaa3</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>), consistent with additional ARF factors playing overlapping role with ARF6 and ARF8 and being suppressed by <i>iaa3</i>. These results indicate that BR activation of genes for hypocotyl elongation is dependent on auxin activation of ARFs, whereas BR feedback repression of BR biosynthesis genes is independent of auxin signaling."

To understand the functional importance of the interactions between ARF6, BZR1, and PIF4, we analyzed the effects of genetic alteration of each component on the growth responses to changes in the other activities. Hypocotyl elongation of the BR receptor mutant <i>bri1</i> shows diminished response to auxin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), as observed previously (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nemhauser et al., 2004</a>), but the auxin-insensitive phenotype of <i>bri1</i> was fully rescued by <i>bzr1-1D</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), indicating that BZR1 mediates BR enhancement of auxin response. The hypersensitivity of <i>bzr1-1D</i> to auxin was abolished by the <i>iaa3</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), suggesting that ARF activity is required for BZR1 function. Consistently, both <i>iaa3</i> and <i>arf6;arf8</i> were less sensitive to BR than was wild type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Furthermore, the <i>bzr1-1D;arf6;arf8</i> triple mutant and <i>bzr1-1D;iaa3</i> double mutant showed shorter hypocotyls on the medium containing BR biosynthesis inhibitor BRZ than the <i>bzr1-1D</i> single mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>), indicating that ARF6/8 are required for BZR1 promotion of hypocotyl elongation. Finally, to determine whether PIFs are required for auxin response, we checked the hypocotyl response to auxin in <i>pifq</i> and <i>PAR1-OX</i>. Compared with wild type, <i>pifq</i> was less sensitive and <i>PAR1-OX</i> was almost insensitive to auxin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). These results indicate that ARF, BZR1 and PIFs are interdependent in promoting hypocotyl elongation, consistent with their cooperative regulation of a core set of genes involved in hypocotyl cell elongation."

Therefore, PRE1 and IBH1 may modulate auxin response by altering HBI1 activity. Indeed, knock down of multiple <i>PREs</i> (<i>PRE1</i>, <i>PRE2</i>, <i>PRE5</i> and <i>PRE6</i>) by artificial micro-RNA (<i>pre-amiR</i>) or overexpression of IBH1 (<i>IBH1-OX</i>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bai et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2012b</a>), significantly reduced the sensitivity of transgenic plants to auxin in terms of both hypocotyl elongation and gene expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>)."

We confirmed the developmental regulation of expression of <i>PRE1</i>, <i>PRE5</i> and <i>IBH1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), and found that auxin treatment induced bigger fold changes of the <i>PREs</i> and <i>SAUR15</i> expression levels in young stems than in mature stems (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The reduced auxin sensitivity of the <i>SAUR15</i> gene in the mature stem was restored in the <i>PRE1-OX</i>, <i>HBI1-OX</i> and <i>PIF4-OX</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), supporting that developmental regulation of <i>PREs</i> and <i>IBH1</i> impacts auxin sensitivity through PIF4 and HBI1. The expression level of BR biosynthesis gene <i>DWF4</i> was high in young stems but low in mature stems (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Consistent with the expression pattern of <i>DWF4</i>, BZR1 was less phosphorylated in the young stems than in the mature stems (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>), indicating that BZR1 is more activated in the young tissues (<a href=\"#bib20\">He et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gampala et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ryu et al., 2007</a>). Since BZR1 interacts with ARF6 to potentiate auxin response, differential BZR1 activity may also contribute to the difference in auxin sensitivity between young and mature tissues. Indeed, activation of BZR1 by the <i>bzr1-1D</i> mutation increased auxin sensitivity of <i>SAUR15</i> expression in the mature stem (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). Together, these results suggest that developmental regulation of BZR1 and HLH factors contributes to the changes of auxin sensitivity over the progression of organ development."

A comparison of ARF6 targets with BZR1 and PIF4 targets revealed that GA-activated genes are enriched in the common targets of ARF6, BZR1, and PIF4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>), suggesting that ARF6 is also involved in GA response. Therefore, we tested whether ARF6 directly interacts with the DELLA protein RGA. In yeast two-hybrid assays, RGA interacted with the middle domain and, to a lesser extent, the DNA binding domain of ARF6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). RGA also interacted with other activator ARFs (ARF6, ARF7 and ARF8), but not repressor ARF1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In addition, HA-RGA, but not HA-YFP, was pulled down by ARF6-Myc in vitro (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), and RGA-GFP was co-immunoprecipitated with ARF6-Myc in <i>Arabidopsis</i> protoplasts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). These results demonstrate that RGA directly interacts with ARF6. Since the middle domain of ARF6 also mediates the ARF6-PIF4/BZR1 interactions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), it is likely that RGA competes with PIF4/BZR1 for interaction with ARF6. Indeed, the ARF6-PIF4 interaction was reduced by rga-\u039417, which is a stable form of RGA due to deletion of the N-terminal DELLA domain (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bai et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), suggesting that RGA disrupts the ARF6\u2013PIF4 interaction."

In addition, the auxin promotion of hypocotyl elongation was compromised in the GA-insensitive mutant <i>gai-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Peng et al., 1997</a>) and in wild-type plants grown on the medium containing GA biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>), both of which accumulate DELLA proteins, but was nearly normal in the PAC-treated <i>della pentuple</i> mutant (<i>della</i>) lacking all five members of the DELLA family (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>), indicating that accumulation of DELLA proteins inhibits auxin sensitivity.

The level of such ability that has evolved for the cellular control systems of plants remains unclear. While cell elongation, as the major growth process in plants, is the target of many signaling pathways that have evolved to provide the high level of developmental plasticity in higher plants, it has been unclear whether these pathways act on independent cellular machineries involved in elongation or they are processed by a central control system into a coherent cellular decision. Although physiological synergism and genetic interdependency suggested signal integration, the essential molecular connections between the signaling pathways, particularly with the auxin pathway, have been elusive. Our findings of the BZR-ARF-PIF/DELLA (BAP/D) module illustrate an elegant model of signal integration, which explains the synergistic or antagonistic interactions between auxin and the other signaling pathways. Our study demonstrates that hypocotyl cell elongation is controlled by major hormonal and environmental pathways through a central circuit of interacting transcription regulators."

The incomplete overlap between targets of BZR1, ARF6, and PIF4 suggests that their interactions are selected and/or facilitated by specific promoters to allow co-regulation of hypocotyl elongation and photomorphogenesis, while each pathway or combination of two pathways may regulate other gene sets and developmental processes.

In addition to light, temperature and the circadian clock transcriptionally regulate members of PIF family (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nozue et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Koini et al., 2009</a>), and consequently alter auxin synthesis as well as auxin sensitivity through the BAP module. The integral role of PIFs in hormone-responsive gene expression is also consistent with the finding of the HUD element, a potential binding site of PIF4/5, associated with the morning-specific phytohormone gene expression program (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nozue et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Michael et al., 2008</a>). The DNA-binding activities of PIFs are also modulated by the tripartite HLH/bHLH module, in which the PRE family of non-DNA binding HLH factors sequesters another class of HLH factors (including IBH1 and PAR1), which otherwise inhibit DNA-binding of bHLH factors including HBI1 and PIFs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ikeda et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bai et al., 2012a</a>). The HLH/bHLH module has a major effect on plant sensitivity to auxin, BR and GA, presumably by controlling PIF4 and HBI1, which both interact with ARF6. Considering that GA, BR, auxin, and PIF4 increase the transcription levels of several <i>PRE</i> members (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chapman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Oh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bai et al., 2012b</a>), the HLH/bHLH modules appear to form positive feedback loops, which potentially re-enforce the activation of the BAP module and help maintain the growing condition in the dark or in young developing organs. The increase of <i>IBH1</i> expression appears to mediate, at least partly, inactivation of hormone responses in mature organs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), whereas a decrease of <i>HBI1</i> expression mediates growth arrest and defense activation in response to pathogen infection (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Malinovsky et al., 2014</a>).

Physiological studies supported additive effects of auxin and GA, while a recent study suggested that auxin regulates GA biosynthesis to release DELLA-dependent growth repression (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chapman et al., 2012</a>). In this study, we show that GA promotion of hypocotyl elongation also requires auxin activation of ARFs, as the <i>iaa3</i> and <i>arf6,arf8</i> mutants show severely reduced GA response in hypocotyl elongation. Similar to DELLA inhibition of BZR1 and PIFs, DELLA also inhibits DNA-binding of ARF6. In contrast to the cooperative interactions among BZR1, ARF6, and PIF4, the DELLA protein RGA inhibits ARF6\u2013PIF4 interaction. As such, DELLA inhibits both protein\u2013DNA and protein\u2013protein interactions of the BAP module, providing presumably coordinated and coherent control of all three components of the BAP module. Together, our study illustrates that the major growth-regulation pathways, auxin, BR, GA, and phytochrome, converge at the BAP/D module to control hypocotyl cell elongation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We propose that the BAP/D module coupled with the HLH/bHLH module forms the central growth regulation network that integrates hormonal, environmental, and developmental inputs into the decisions about hypocotyl cell elongation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

The lack of interaction of BZR1 and PIF4 with ARF7 or ARF1 indicates a level of specificity of signal integration through ARF6 and ARF8 for regulation of hypocotyls and other shoot organs where ARF6 and ARF8 play important roles. Recent studies showed that auxin also acts through a receptor kinase-mediated signaling pathway to regulate cell morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib51\">Xu et al., 2014</a>); the details of this new auxin pathway and its relationships with the ARF-mediated auxin pathway and other hormonal and environmental signaling pathways are yet to be elucidated by future studies. Apparently, hormone interactions are complex and vary with developmental context. While the BAP/D module explains how auxin, BR, GA, light, and temperature coordinately regulate cell elongation of the hypocotyl, and likely other shoot organs in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, mechanisms of signal integration in other developmental contexts might be different and thus remain be elucidated."
