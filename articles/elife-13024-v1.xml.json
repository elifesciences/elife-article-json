Here, we identify roles of Rev-erb nuclear receptors in regulating responses of mouse macrophages to complex tissue damage signals and wound repair. Rather than reinforcing a specific program of macrophage polarization, Rev-erbs repress subsets of genes that are activated by TLR ligands, IL4, TGF\u03b2, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS). Unexpectedly, a complex damage signal promotes co-localization of NF-\u03baB, Smad3, and Nrf2 at Rev-erb-sensitive enhancers and drives expression of genes characteristic of multiple polarization states in the same cells. Rev-erb-sensitive enhancers thereby integrate multiple damage-activated signaling pathways to promote a wound repair phenotype."

Here, we identify roles of Rev-erb nuclear receptors in regulating responses of mouse macrophages to complex tissue damage signals and wound repair. Rather than reinforcing a specific program of macrophage polarization, Rev-erbs repress subsets of genes that are activated by TLR ligands, IL4, TGF\u03b2, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS). Unexpectedly, a complex damage signal promotes co-localization of NF-\u03baB, Smad3, and Nrf2 at Rev-erb-sensitive enhancers and drives expression of genes characteristic of multiple polarization states in the same cells. Rev-erb-sensitive enhancers thereby integrate multiple damage-activated signaling pathways to promote a wound repair phenotype."

As immune cells, macrophages serve as sentinels of infection and injury and are active participants in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Detection of pathogens and tissue damage is mediated by a diverse array of pattern recognition receptors for pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), exemplified by the toll-like receptors (TLRs). Ligation of TLRs initiates profound changes in gene expression that include induction of chemokines, cytokines, anti-microbial peptides, and other factors that contribute to the innate immune response and influence adaptive immunity (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ostuni et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lawrence and Natoli, 2011</a>). This response has been extensively characterized in vitro by treating cultured macrophages with specific TLR ligands such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent activator of TLR4 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kaikkonen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Escoubet-Lozach et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Raetz et al., 2006</a>). TLR4 ligation regulates gene expression through signal transduction pathways culminating in the activation of latent signal-dependent transcription factors, which include members of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), interferon regulatory factor (IRF), and activator protein 1 (AP-1) families (<a href=\"#bib39\">Medzhitov and Horng, 2009</a>). In macrophages, these factors are primarily directed to macrophage-specific enhancers that are selected by macrophage lineage determining transcription factors, PU.1 and CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heinz et al., 2010</a>). The macrophage activation phenotype resulting from selective treatment with LPS, or in some cases a combination of LPS and interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), is referred to as M(LPS) or M(LPS+IFN\u03b3) activation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Murray et al., 2014</a>), and is considered vital for the host response to bacterial or viral infection."

These functions are controlled by complex microenvironmental pathways that include reductionist signals such as transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) and interleukin 4 (IL4). TGF\u03b2 is generally considered to be an inducer of a 'de-activated' macrophage or M(TGF\u03b2) phenotype, although it also acts as a potent chemo-attractant for monocytes and can potentiate their transition into activated cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2006</a>). Macrophages respond to TGF\u03b2 in both an autocrine and paracrine manner. For example, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells results in increased macrophage-mediated secretion of TGF\u03b2 and subsequent inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2006</a>). In addition to dampening inflammatory responses, secreted TGF\u03b2 plays key roles in accelerating wound healing and fibrosis (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schuppan and Kim, 2013</a>). At the transcriptional level, TGF\u03b2 signal transduction pathways function primarily in a Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (SMAD)-dependent manner through Smad2-, Smad3-, and Smad4-mediated activation, as well as Smad7-mediated inhibition (<a href=\"#bib38\">Massagu\u00e9, 2012</a>). Like other signal-dependent transcription factors, ligation of TGF\u03b2 receptors causes the localization of Smad3 to genomic loci containing lineage-determining transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mullen et al., 2011</a>)."

Recent studies show that these combinations of signals can influence the transcriptional landscape of macrophages in an input-specific fashion (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lavin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ginhoux et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gosselin et al., 2014</a>).

Rev-erbs mediate transcriptional repression through recruitment of the nuclear co-repressor (NCoR) and histone de-acetylase 3 (HDAC3) complex (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yin and Lazar, 2005</a>). Rev-erbs lack the carboxy-terminal (AF2) transactivation domain, which is required for recruitment of co-activators (<a href=\"#bib7\">Durand et al., 1994</a>). Genome-wide location analysis of Rev-erb\u03b1 and Rev-erb\u03b2 in macrophages revealed thousands of binding sites, the vast majority of which resided at macrophage-specific enhancer-like regions of the genome established by PU.1 and other macrophage lineage determining factors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lam et al., 2013</a>). Gain and loss of function experiments indicated that Rev-erbs function to suppress the activities of these enhancers by repressing enhancer-directed transcription. While these studies provided insights into the functional significance of enhancer transcription, the biological consequences of the actions of Rev-erbs at these distal regulatory elements were not explored."

Rather than exerting a pattern of repression that reinforces a particular polarization phenotype, Rev-erbs regulate subsets of signal responsive genes that span those associated with M(LPS) or M(LPS+IFN\u03b3), M(TGF\u03b2), and M(IL4) phenotypes, enriching for functions associated with wound repair. Consistent with these in vitro observations, deletion of Rev-erbs from the hematopoietic lineage in vivo results in accelerated wound repair. Unexpectedly, we found that a complex tissue injury signal directs genomic binding patterns for NF-\u03baB p65 (p65), FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Fos \u2013 a member of the activator protein 1, or AP-1, family), and Smad3 that differ substantially from those observed following selective treatments with a TLR4 agonist or TGF\u03b2. In addition, by analyzing changes in enhancer signatures, we identified Nrf2 as an additional mediator of the transcriptional response to the tissue injury signal. While these transcription factors exhibit relatively little co-localization in response to single polarizing ligands, we observe substantial co-localization and enhancer activation in response to the complex tissue injury signal, resulting in transcriptional outcomes that are qualitatively different than the sum of single polarizing signals. These observations provide insights into how combinations of signals are integrated at a transcriptional level to result in context-specific patterns of gene expression."

To study the phenotypic contribution of Rev-erbs to signal-dependent gene expression in macrophages, we performed RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of poly(A) mRNA isolated from wild-type macrophages and those deficient for both Rev-erb\u03b1 and Rev-erb\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>).

Deletion of Rev-erb\u03b2 exons to generate a non-functional Rev-erb\u03b2 mRNA results in marked de-repression of Rev-erb\u03b1 expression and increased expression of a DNA binding domain deleted form of Rev-erb\u03b1 mRNA (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sud et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013b</a>).

Although myeloid cells represent only a small fraction of the total cells analyzed in the wound biopsy, 5590 genes exhibited concordant changes in expression with those observed following stimulation of macrophages with tissue homogenate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Gene ontology analysis of this set of genes indicated significant enrichment for biological process terms related to response to wounding, immune response, and cell adhesion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Response to wounding was the most highly enriched gene ontology term associated with genes de-repressed greater than two-fold in Rev-erb DKO tissue homogenate treated macrophages (282) followed by immune response and taxis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). De-repressed genes in Rev-erb DKO macrophages with gene ontology annotations linked to response to wounding and immune response are indicated in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>.

Genes associated with distinct polarization states resulting from activation with single ligands but exhibiting co-expression following treatment with tissue homogenate could reflect co-expression at the single cell level or mutually exclusive expression in subpopulations. To address this question, we performed RT-Q-PCR analysis of mRNA isolated from single cells maintained under control conditions or treated with tissue homogenate for 6\u2009hr. We evaluated panels of mRNAs in triplicates corresponding to genes selectively activated by LPS or LPS+IFN\u03b3, IL4, TGF\u03b2, or tissue homogenate signals, as well as informative transcription factors and reference genes. After filtering for dead/duplicate cells and eliminating probes with altered melting curves, data was obtained for 30 genes in 80 control cells and 70 homogenate-treated cells. The distributions of expression values of genes in individual cells under control or tissue homogenate treatment conditions are illustrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>. Cells treated with tissue homogenate were clustered in a binary fashion, according to whether the gene was expressed or not expressed. Notably, evaluating individual genes by column, a subset from each category of polarization states is expressed in the majority of cells (e.g., <i>Cxcl1, Dusp4, Cx3cr1, Pf4</i>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). Conversely, evaluating the total set of genes across individual cells, genes from each polarization state can be expressed at similar levels in the same cell (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). Of interest, clustering revealed two main groups that were distinguished by lack of detectable expression of <i>Fos</i> and <i>Rela</i>. Cells lacking <i>Fos</i> and <i>Rela</i> expression also exhibit reduced expression of subsets of genes in the M(LPS) or M(LPS+IFN\u03b3), tissue homogenate, and transcription factor categories. Collectively, these findings indicate that while there is substantial heterogeneity in gene expression at the single cell level, genes characteristic of M(LPS) or M(LPS+IFN\u03b3), M(TGF\u03b2), and M(IL4) polarization states can be co-expressed in individual cells."

This was also the top motif recovered from motif analysis of genomic regions exhibiting a gain in H3K27ac 3\u2009hr following stimulation with tissue homogenate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). Nrf2 is a latent basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein that is activated in response to cell injury and inflammation, and regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). Evaluation of RNA-seq data from both the in vivo\u00a0wound model and tissue homogenate-treated macrophages revealed upregulation of numerous Nrf2 target genes, including <i>Txn1, Sod2, Hmox1, Prdx6,</i> and <i>Nqo1</i>, suggesting that Nrf2 is activated in macrophages as part of the wound response (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a>). We therefore performed ChIP-Seq analysis for Nrf2 in macrophages before and after tissue homogenate treatment.

This co-binding of transcription factors is further emphasized when comparing the overlap of the investigated transcription factors upon treatment of cells with tissue homogenate or the vehicle control (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7f and g</a>).

While ChIP-Seq experiments documented that tissue homogenate induces genomic binding of p65, Smad3, and Nrf2, these studies do not establish functional roles of these factors in the integrated transcriptional response. To address this question, we evaluated effects of chemical inhibitors of NF-\u03baB, Smad3, and Nrf2 on gene expression in tissue homogenate-treated macrophages, using the IKK inhibitor VII to inhibit NF-\u03baB activity, SB-43154 to inhibit TGF\u03b2 signaling, and glutathione to block the activation of Nrf2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a\u2013c</a>). These studies support the idea that each factor contributes to the integrated response to tissue homogenate. For example, activation of <i>Cx3cr1</i> by tissue homogenate was decreased upon targeting the NF-\u03baB, TGF\u03b2 receptor, and Nrf2 pathways, supporting the involvement of all of these pathways in the regulation of this gene. Conversely, tissue homogenate activation of other genes was more dependent on specific signal-dependent pathways. For instance, <i>Dusp5</i> activation was sensitive to NF-\u03baB inhibition (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>) while <i>Nptx1</i> activation was unaffected by NF-\u03baB inhibition (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>). Surprisingly, <i>Socs3</i> activation was sensitive to both inhibition of NF-\u03baB and TGF\u03b2 receptor signaling (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a and b</a>) and <i>Ctla2b</i> was selectively sensitive to inhibition of TGF\u03b2 receptor signaling (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b</a>). Established Nrf2 target genes <i>Txn1</i> and <i>Hmox1,</i> which were also induced by tissue homogenate, were repressed by glutathione co-treatment (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>). Finally, we investigated the ability of the Rev-erb agonist SR-9009 to influence the responses to tissue homogenate. This agonist repressed a subset of genes in tissue homogenate-treated macrophages, exemplified by <i>Cx3cr1, Gpr84</i>, and <i>Pgd</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d</a>). These results are consistent with these genes being de-repressed in Rev-Erb DKO macrophages."

However, the great majority of Rev-erb binding sites in macrophages are located at cell-specific enhancers, which are selected by macrophage lineage-determining factors such as PU.1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lam et al., 2013</a>). These observations predicted that in addition to cell autonomous regulation of the circadian rhythm, Rev-erbs would also regulate a macrophage-specific program of gene expression. Here, using loss of function, transcriptomic, and epigenetic analyses, we demonstrate that Rev-erbs function to repress a network of genes associated with the response to wounding. Consistent with altered transcriptional responses observed in vitro, loss of Rev-erb expression in cells derived from the bone marrow compartment resulted in accelerated wound healing in the skin. As the Rev-erbs are deleted from all hematopoietic lineages in these experiments, further studies will be required to establish the relative contributions of macrophages and other bone marrow-derived cells to this phenotype. How this function of Rev-erbs might contribute to normal tissue homeostasis is as yet unclear. In vivo, Rev-erb expression is circadian (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cho et al., 2012</a>), implying that the effects on macrophage gene expression observed in the present studies are likely to vary over the course of the day. Rev-erbs may thus act in a circadian manner to regulate aspects of tissue macrophage gene expression required for the normal turnover of extracellular matrix, tissue remodeling, and wound healing."

Consistent with this, Rev-erbs co-localize with NF-\u03baB p65 and AP-1 family member Fos at enhancers activated by TLR ligands, and with Smad3 at enhancers activated by TGF\u03b2. Although of interest from a mechanistic standpoint, these findings are of uncertain relevance to functions of macrophages within tissue environments, which contain a multitude of signaling molecules that are sensed simultaneously. To model the complex environment associated with acute tissue damage, we treated macrophages with a supernatant of a skin homogenate. While the specific identities and concentrations of the DAMPs, MAMPs, and other bioactive molecules in this homogenate are unknown, we provide evidence that the transcriptomic response of the macrophage to this mixture overlaps significantly with the transcriptional response observed in a skin wound, thereby validating its use. Through ChIP-Seq experiments, we demonstrate that this complex signal coordinately induces binding of NF-\u03baB, AP-1, and Smad transcription factors. Furthermore, <i>de novo</i> motif analysis of activated enhancers led to the unexpected discovery that the tissue damage signal also acutely activates Nrf2. This finding illustrates the utility of enhancer analysis to identify transcriptional mediators of unknown environmental factors, providing a basis for subsequent directed analysis of corresponding upstream signaling pathways. Accordingly, the use of glutathione to neutralize reactive oxygen species, thus blocking the downstream disruption of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-Cuilin 3 (Cul3) complex required for activation of Nrf2 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gorrini et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Shibata et al., 2013</a>) provides evidence for its functional importance in the transcriptional response to the tissue damage signal. Similarly, the use of inhibitors of NF-\u03baB and TGF\u03b2 provided corresponding support for functionally important roles of these transcription factors. Of course, there are likely to be many other signaling pathways and downstream transcription factors involved in the tissue damage response. Furthermore, Rev-erb deficiency likely modifies both basal and signal dependent transcriptional programs. To distinguish between 'prior' versus 'post-activation' roles of Rev-erbs in macrophages during wound healing may require the use of inducible Cre-expression strategies, as well as measurements of target gene expression in situ in macrophage infiltrated wounds."

The first is that the complex signal provided by tissue homogenate induced co-expression of genes characteristic of distinct macrophage polarization states within individual cells. Second, we found that the tissue homogenate signal induced different genomic locations of p65, Fos, and Smad3 than were observed following KLA or TGF\u03b2, respectively, resulting in co-binding at a large number of enhancer-like regions in the vicinity of tissue homogenate-induced genes. An important implication of these findings is that transcription factors binding maps are context-dependent and must be interpreted accordingly. We speculate that the observed co-localization of factors in response to the complex signal enables the appropriate integration of multiple relevant signaling components necessary for the initial acquisition of a wound repair phenotype (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e</a>). Third, the present findings may have practical applications based on the development of small molecules that enhance or inhibit Rev-erb repressive activity (<a href=\"#bib51\">Solt et al., 2012</a>). Delayed wound healing is observed in a number of pathological contexts, including in diabetics (<a href=\"#bib9\">Falanga, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sen et al., 2009</a>)\u00a0and in immunocompromised individuals (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lin et al., 2011</a>). In these settings, it is possible that Rev-erb antagonists could be evaluated as a means of enhancing wound repair. Alternatively, a large number of devastating and largely untreatable diseases are characterized by exaggerated tissue fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial renal fibrosis, and liver fibrosis (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schuppan and Kim, 2013</a>). We demonstrate that a Rev-erb agonist can suppress a subset of genes that are de-repressed in the Rev-erb DKO and are regulated by the complex wound signal. Overall, our findings suggest that Rev-erbs act to repress a specific combination of genes downstream of multiple signaling pathways that collectively function in an integrated manner to promote the response to wounding (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e</a>). It will therefore be of interest to evaluate whether defects in Rev-erb signaling are associated with these diseases and whether pharmacological modulation of Rev-erb might be of therapeutic benefit."

The volume of the blood was determined by pipetting and transferred to 5\u2009ml round bottom tubes with 50 \u00b5l of Life Technologies (Carlsbad,\u00a0CA)\u00a0CountBright Absolute Counting Beads. Erythrocytes were lysed by addition of 4\u2009ml eBioscience RBC lysis buffer with incubation at 4C for 5 mins. Cells were collected by centrifugation and the supernatant was carefully removed. Cells were washed once more and resuspended in buffer containing anti-CD16/CD32 (clone 93, BioLegend) and Zombie Aqua fixable viability dye (BioLegend). After 10 min, cells were stained with the following 2X antibody cocktail: anti-mouse CD11b BD Horizon BUV395 (clone M1/70, BD Biosciences), anti-mouse CD19 BD Horizon BUV737 (clone1D3, BD Biosciences), anti-mouse CD115 Brilliant Violet 421 (clone AFS98, BioLegend), anti-mouse CD90.2 Brilliant Violet 785 (clone 30-H12, BioLegend), anti-mouse Ly6G FITC (clone 1A8, BioLegend), anti-mouse CD45.2 PE (clone 104, BioLegend), anti-mouse CD45.1 Alexa Fluor 647 (clone A20, BioLegend), and anti-mouse Ly6C APC/Cy7 (clone HK1.4, BioLegend). After 20 min, cells were washed, and counted on a Beckman\u00a0Colter\u00a0MoFlo Astrios EQ equipped with 355 nm, 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm lasers. Cells per \u00b5l were determined by following the manufacturer protocol for CountBright Absolute Counting Beads. Cells of interest were identified by excluding Zombie Aqua that fell within consecutive singlet gates using SSC and FSC. Donor derived monocytes were identified as CD45.2+, CD19-, CD90.2-, CD115+, Ly6G-, and CD11b+. Monocytes were further segregated based on expression of Ly6C. To test the dependence on hematopoietic derived expression of Rev-erb \u03b1/\u03b2 on peripheral blood cell populations, we used a Welch two sample t-test using R."

To achieve anesthesia, 0.4\u20130.75 mg/g was administered intra-peritoneally. A 3\u2009mm punch biopsy (Miltex,\u00a0York,\u00a0PA) was used to generate four wounds on the dorsal skin of each animal. Wounds were systematically photographed from a fixed distance daily. For macroscopic analysis, genotypes were blinded and the size of the wound was analyzed by Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA), and normalized to its size on Day 0. Mice were housed singularly throughout the duration of the study."

Harvested wounds were cut along the mid-sagittal plane and paraffin-embedded. Genotypes were blinded for subsequent histological analyses. The first section along the mid-sagittal plane was utilized for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Subsequent sections were utilized for immunohistochemical analysis using the following primary antibodies: biotinylated anti-F4/80 (AbD Serotec\u00a0(now\u00a0Bio-Rad), MCA4978, 1:50 dilution), IgG (Dako, Glostrup Municipality, Denmark), rat anti-Ly6B.2 (AbD Serotec\u00a0(now\u00a0Bio-Rad), MCA771GA, 1:200), and the following secondary antibodies: biotinylated anti-rat (1:500, BD ), as well as HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:500, Jackson Laboratory), Briefly, slides were de-paraffinized and washed three times in 0.1% Tween-20 PBS. Blocking was performed sequentially using 3% hydrogen peroxide (10 min), 1% BSA in 0.1% Tween-20 PBS (10 min), 0.1% avidin (10 min), and 0.01% biotin (10 min). Three washes were performed between each blocking step using 0.1% Tween-20 PBS. Antigen retrieval was performed using proteinase K (Dako, S3020), followed by three washes and subsequent overnight incubation with the indicated primary antibodies. After three washes, slides were incubated with the indicated secondary antibodies for 30 min and developed using AEC Peroxidase Substrate Kit (Vector Labs,\u00a0Burlingame,\u00a0CA, SK-4200) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Macrophages were allowed to migrate through basement membrane extract (Corning, 3458) for 24\u2009hr. Afterwards, the wells were briefly washed with PBS, and migrated macrophages were dissociated from the membrane and incubated with Calcein AM. Relative fluorescence was measured using a SpectraMax M3 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and the SoftMax Pro software (485 nm excitation, 520 nm emission). A standard curve was used to convert relative fluorescence to cell numbers."

The authors show that macrophages integrate their signals in a context-specific fashion and that this is mainly driven by combinatorial action of several transcription factors, something that was also recently suggested for human monocyte-derived macrophages assessing reductionist in vitro models (Schmidt et al., Cell Research, 2016). This work is a logical and important next step towards understanding of the complex regulation and integration of environmental signals following reductionist models studied so far, and demonstrating that it is absolutely essential to overcome the previous simple model of polarized macrophage activation."

It would be best not to use the terms M1/M2 at all; according to a new nomenclature suggested by Murray and colleagues (Immunity, 2014), terminology would be best changed throughout the manuscript (M1 = M(IFN\u03b3), M2 = M(IL4)). This does not take away the major message of the story but would better reflect the current thought process in explaining how signals from the tissue and complex patterns of stress signals (as modeled here by tissue homogenates) are integrated by macrophages. In this context, the manuscript could introduce the reductionist stimuli (KLA, IL4, TGF\u03b2) as a framework and could predict that combinatorial signals such as those from tissue homogenates would lead to the identification of so far unknown combinations of transcriptional regulators, mainly transcription factors associated with particular functions of macrophages, here response to wounding. This would provide a nice illustration of how one can use reductionist models and combine them into models with high relevance in vivo."

It would be best not to use the terms M1/M2 at all; according to a new nomenclature suggested by Murray and colleagues (Immunity, 2014), terminology would be best changed throughout the manuscript (M1 = M(IFN\u03b3), M2 = M(IL4)). This does not take away the major message of the story but would better reflect the current thought process in explaining how signals from the tissue and complex patterns of stress signals (as modeled here by tissue homogenates) are integrated by macrophages. In this context, the manuscript could introduce the reductionist stimuli (KLA, IL4, TGF\u03b2) as a framework and could predict that combinatorial signals such as those from tissue homogenates would lead to the identification of so far unknown combinations of transcriptional regulators, mainly transcription factors associated with particular functions of macrophages, here response to wounding. This would provide a nice illustration of how one can use reductionist models and combine them into models with high relevance in vivo.</i>"

We gave serious consideration to the suggestion to perform mixed chimera experiments, and as described below, performed new bone marrow transplantation experiments to address other concerns. However, we were not able to devise an experimental plan using existing strains of mice that would provide a clear-cut answer to this question. The most straightforward approach would be to use alternative deleter strains to generate mice in which the Rev-erbs are selectively and/or inducibly deleted in macrophages as suggested in Point 5, below. However, even these approaches are not definitive, e.g., the conventional LysM-Cre strain also deletes genes in granulocytes, which could contribute to the wound healing phenotype, and does not delete efficiently in some of the resident macrophage populations of the skin. Our main purpose in presenting the wound phenotype was to provide a biological context for the subsequent molecular analyses of the effects of complex signals on transcription factor interactions. While we think that the wound repair findings are significant in themselves and will be of general interest, restricting or expanding the cell types involved would not alter the main conclusions of the manuscript. We therefore hope that a definitive answer to this question will not be required for publication in <i>eLife</i>. To address the Reviewer\u2019s concerns on this point, we more clearly state in the Results and Discussion that the accelerated wound repair phenotype results from a loss of Rev-erb expression in cells derived from the bone marrow compartment and that further studies will be required to establish the relative contributions of macrophages and other bone marrow-derived cells."
