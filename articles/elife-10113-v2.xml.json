                    "text": "Microtubule dynamic instability depends on the GTPase activity of the polymerizing \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin subunits, which cycle through at least three distinct conformations as they move into and out of microtubules. How this conformational cycle contributes to microtubule growing, shrinking, and switching remains unknown. Here, we report that a buried mutation in \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin yields microtubules with dramatically reduced shrinking rate and catastrophe frequency. The mutation causes these effects by suppressing a conformational change that normally occurs in response to GTP hydrolysis in the lattice, without detectably changing the conformation of unpolymerized \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. Thus, the mutation weakens the coupling between the conformational and GTPase cycles of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. By showing that the mutation predominantly affects post-GTPase conformational and dynamic properties of microtubules, our data reveal that the strength of the allosteric response to GDP in the lattice dictates the frequency of catastrophe and the severity of rapid shrinking."

How this conformational cycle contributes to microtubule growing, shrinking, and switching remains unknown. Here, we report that a buried mutation in \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin yields microtubules with dramatically reduced shrinking rate and catastrophe frequency. The mutation causes these effects by suppressing a conformational change that normally occurs in response to GTP hydrolysis in the lattice, without detectably changing the conformation of unpolymerized \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. Thus, the mutation weakens the coupling between the conformational and GTPase cycles of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. By showing that the mutation predominantly affects post-GTPase conformational and dynamic properties of microtubules, our data reveal that the strength of the allosteric response to GDP in the lattice dictates the frequency of catastrophe and the severity of rapid shrinking."

Chromosomes, which contain the cell\u2019s genetic blueprints, are the microtubule\u2019s most precious cargo. Before a cell divides, microtubules grow from the ends of the dividing cell towards the middle, where they attach to the chromosomes that are lined up along the centerline.

This acts like a cap and protects the microtubule from shrinking. Later a chemical reaction converts GTP into GDP (short for guanosine diphosphate). Without the protective GTP cap, the microtubule quickly shrinks. At the same time, the proteins that make up the microtubule also change shape. In the microtubule, the proteins adopt a straight shape when GTP is attached. The proteins favor a different shape in the microtubule when GDP is attached. However, it is unclear if or how these shape changes contribute to how a microtubule grows or shrinks."

Another recent example of selective interactions with specific conformations of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin comes from work in our laboratory showing that TOG domains from the microtubule polymerase Stu2p bind preferentially to the curved conformation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ayaz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">2014</a>), and that this preference of TOG domains for curved \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin is probably what allows the polymerase to localize to the growing tip of the microtubule (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ayaz et al., 2014</a>).

A similar argument can be made about the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin conformational changes that occur as a consequence of GTP hydrolysis deeper in the microtubule lattice. One reason these questions are still debated is that to date in vitro microtubule dynamics have only been measured for a small number of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin mutants (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gupta et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dougherty et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sage et al., 1995</a>), and it has not yet been possible to link altered dynamics to a change in the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin conformational cycle."

We reasoned that mutating buried residues with different packing environments in the curved and straight conformations might provide a way to perturb the conformational cycle. We focused on helix H7 because it is an element that is positioned differently in the \u2018curved\u2019 (unpolymerized) and \u2018straight\u2019 (polymerized) conformations of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nogales et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ravelli et al., 2004</a>)(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and it may act as a structural relay connecting the \u2018top\u2019 and \u2018bottom\u2019 of the tubulin subunits (<a href=\"#bib4\">Amos, 2004</a>). The equivalent helix in \u03b1-tubulin was also recently observed to move in response to GTP hydrolysis in the lattice (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alushin et al., 2014</a>). We chose to study the T238A mutation in \u03b2-tubulin because this sidechain resides on helix H7 and is buried in the core of the protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and because prior studies (<a href=\"#bib51\">Thomas et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Machin et al., 1995</a>) showed that the \u03b2:T238A phenotype was consistent with hyperstable microtubules. The molecular mechanism by which the \u03b2:T238A mutation affects microtubule dynamics is unknown, in part because the polymerization dynamics of \u03b2:T238A \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin have not been studied in vivo or in vitro. Our studies now reveal that the \u03b2:T238A mutation affects microtubule dynamics by dramatically reducing the frequency of catastrophe and the rate of shrinking, and that the mutation affects microtubule structure by attenuating post-GTPase conformational changes in the lattice. The effects of the mutation are reminiscent of the way the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol affects microtubule structure (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alushin et al., 2014</a>). By showing that the \u03b2:T238A mutation weakens the coupling between the conformational and nucleotide cycles, our results demonstrate that catastrophe can occur despite diminished post-GTPase conformational changes in the microtubule lattice, and that the strength of the allosteric response to GDP dictates the rate of microtubule shrinking and the frequency of microtubule catastrophe."

We were unable to measure mutant and wild-type microtubule dynamics at equivalent concentrations, because \u03b2:T238A \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin showed abundant spontaneous nucleation at the higher concentrations where we measured wild-type, and wild-type \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin does not elongate measurably at the low concentrations where we were able to measure \u03b2:T238A dynamics without excessive nucleation. Mutant and wild-type microtubules nevertheless show similar concentration-dependent elongation rates: fitting lines to mutant and wild-type data reveals that the x-intercepts of the two datasets (0.12 and 0.033 \u00b5M for wild-type and \u03b2:T238A, respectively) differ by a factor of \u223c3.5 and that the difference in slope (29.6 and 25.5 \u00b5m/hr/\u00b5M for wild-type and \u03b2:T238A, respectively) is not statistically significant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Because the x-intercept and slope respectively relate to the apparent affinity and association rate constant for elongation, our data indicate that the mutation has little effect on the apparent biochemistry of microtubule elongation. Consistent with this biochemical similarity, negative stain electron microscopy revealed that mutant and wild-type microtubules show similar structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In striking contrast to the shared elongation behavior, after catastrophe \u03b2:T238A microtubules shrink roughly hundredfold more slowly than wild-type (1.1 \u00b5m/min for \u03b2:T238A compared to 96 \u00b5m/min for wild-type, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, bottom). Thus, the mutation significantly strengthens the lattice contacts that dictate the rate of microtubule shrinking. Finally, \u03b2:T238A microtubules also undergo catastrophe much less frequently than wild-type. The lower catastrophe frequency we observed is especially notable when considering that in these assays the T238A microtubules were growing much slower than wild-type because of the\u00a0\u223cthreefold lower concentration of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin used for the mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, top)."

It seemed possible that a defective GTPase cycle might explain these observations. We reasoned that if the increased spontaneous nucleation of the \u03b2:T238A mutant resulted from slower/defective GTPase activity, then both mutant and wild-type should nucleate with similar efficiency when GTP hydrolysis cannot occur. We initially attempted to use GMPCPP, the hydrolysis-resistant nucleotide of choice for vertebrate microtubules (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hyman et al., 1992</a>), but GMPCPP did not support elongation of yeast microtubules in our dynamics assays. Yeast microtubules polymerized readily in the presence of GTP\u03b3S, however, indicating that GTP\u03b3S better mimics GTP for yeast microtubules. We observed that even in the presence of GTP\u03b3S, wild-type microtubules show substantially less nucleation than T238A microtubules (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Thus, the abundant nucleation from the mutant cannot be ascribed to a defect in GTPase activity.

We allowed wild-type and \u03b2:T238A \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin to spontaneously polymerize at 1 or 2 \u00b5M concentration (within the range of concentrations tested in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) in the presence of <sup>32</sup>P-GTP. We harvested the microtubules by centrifugation, denatured them to release bound nucleotides, and analyzed the nucleotide content at the exchangeable site using thin layer chromatography (TLC) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). We probed for a GTPase defect using \u03b1-labeled nucleotide to measure the amounts of GTP and GDP in microtubules, and for a phosphate release defect using \u03b3-labeled nucleotide to measure the amounts of GTP and Pi in microtubules. To avoid possible complications that might arise from the very different catastrophe frequencies and shrinking rates, we initially performed these assays under \u2018catastrophe free\u2019 and slow shrinking conditions by using (unlabeled) GTP\u03b3S to support assembly. These experiments revealed that wild-type and mutant microtubules contain similarly low amounts of GTP (2\u20134% of total exchangeable nucleotide) and Pi (fewer than 3% of exchangeable sites) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). When we performed these assays using (unlabeled) GTP to support microtubule assembly, \u03b2:T238A microtubules contained similarly low amounts of GTP and Pi as we observed with GTP\u03b3S but wild-type microtubules appeared to contain a substantially greater amount (\u223c50%) of GTP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Yeast microtubules have previously been reported to contain more GTP than vertebrate microtubules (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dougherty et al., 1998</a>). In control experiments (not shown) we confirmed that vertebrate microtubules contain very little GTP and that individual heterodimers were not pelleting. Because we observed very fast shrinking (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), little <sup>32</sup>P-GTP in microtubules grown with GTP\u03b3S (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and normal plus-end recognition by an EB1 family protein (see below), it seems unlikely that wild-type yeast microtubules contain substantial amounts of GTP. The GTP containing material in our assay might instead reflect oligomers that form more readily for yeast \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. Whatever the mechanism, these experiments demonstrate that \u03b2:T238A \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin remains competent to hydrolyze GTP, and that the altered nucleation and shrinking behavior cannot be ascribed to an accumulation of GTP or GDP.Pi that might result from a defect in assembly-dependent GTPase activity or phosphate release. Some other, nonenzymatic mechanism must therefore account for the observed changes in polymerization dynamics."

It seemed possible that the \u03b2:T238A mutation might stabilize microtubules by shifting the conformational preference of unpolymerized \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin to favor a straight(er) conformation that is more compatible with the microtubule lattice. We used quantitative TOG binding assays (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ayaz et al., 2014</a>) to determine if the \u03b2:T238A mutation changed the \u2018curvature\u2019 of unpolymerized \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. The rationale for this approach is based on the fact that TOG domains bind tightly to curved \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin but very weakly to straight (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ayaz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">2014</a> ). Accordingly, \u03b2:T238A \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin should bind less tightly to a TOG domain if the \u03b2:T238A mutation appreciably changes the conformation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin, for example by straightening it. TOG1 and TOG2, two different TOG domains from the yeast microtubule regulatory factor Stu2p (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wang and Huffaker, 1997</a>), show very similar affinity (within a factor of two) for unpolymerized T238A \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin as they do for wild-type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In energetic terms, this modest difference in affinity is roughly equivalent to one hydrogen bond. While we cannot state that the mutant and wild-type \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin adopt identical conformations, their very similar TOG binding properties indicate that any differences in conformation must be small. Thus, we conclude that the \u03b2:T238A mutation does not significantly change the conformation of unpolymerized \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin."

We therefore infer that like other EB1 proteins on vertebrate microtubules (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zanic et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Maurer et al., 2011</a>), Bim1 discriminates between GTP and GDP forms of the yeast microtubule lattice (presumably, expanded and compacted).

At lower concentrations (5 nM), the Bim1-GFP coat on the body of \u03b2:T238A microtubules is slightly weaker than at the cap but still substantially more intense than on wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This stronger coating reflects tighter Bim1 binding to mutant microtubules, and it occurs in spite of the fact that the mutant microtubules contain very little GTP or GDP.Pi in the exchangeable site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Thus, the \u03b2:T238A mutation attenuates the conformational response to GTP hydrolysis in the microtubule lattice. The structural consequence of the mutation resembles the effect of taxol binding, which also promotes an expanded conformation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin in a GDP lattice (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alushin et al., 2014</a>). Simply put, the mutation appears to have substantially uncoupled the conformational cycle from the nucleotide cycle in the lattice, allowing \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin to retain GTP-lattice-like character even in a GDP lattice."

This observation about \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin in the body of the microtubule cannot by itself explain the slow shrinking, however, because the rate of shrinking is determined by the properties of incompletely surrounded terminal subunits, on which EB1 does not report. Indeed, understanding how different lattice structures relate to dynamic properties of microtubules remains a significant challenge.

The differential response to the mutation inside and outside of microtubules (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>) is consistent with the view that the curved conformation represents the \u2018ground state\u2019 of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin independent of nucleotide state (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rice et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nawrotek et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pecqueur et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Ayaz et al., 2012</a>), that the nucleotide acts across the longitudinal interface (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rice et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nawrotek et al., 2011</a>), and that nucleotide-dependent interactions with the microtubule lattice are what drive\u00a0\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin conformational transitions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rice et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nawrotek et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, the changes we observed can largely be explained by an impaired allosteric response to GDP in the lattice. It will be interesting to discover in future work if other mutations in \u03b2-tubulin can straighten unpolymerized \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin or modulate the allosteric response(s) to nucleotide in the lattice, and to determine if mutations in \u03b1-tubulin can yield similar effects."

By describing microtubules with identical interface composition that nevertheless undergo strikingly different polymerization dynamics, our data demonstrate that allostery in the lattice dictates functionally important aspects of microtubule polymerization dynamics (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Based on the central role of allostery in controlling the frequency of catastrophe and the rate of shrinking, we speculate that cooperative conformational linkage in the lattice amplifies the individual response to nucleotide. Together, the allosteric response to GDP and the intrinsic bias of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin toward the curved conformation elevate and separate the threshold concentrations for persistent elongation and for spontaneous nucleation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), and underlie the fast shrinking rate that makes catastrophe more decisive. These allosteric contributions to microtubule dynamics make microtubules more amenable to regulation by cellular factors that enhance elongation, trigger catastrophe, and promote nucleation."

After 10-fold dilution into water, samples were loaded onto a Cellulose PEI TLC plate (Selecto Scientific) and TLC was performed, first with water followed by buffer containing 0.75 M Tris, 0.4 M LiCl, and 0.45 M HCl. The TLC plate was exposed to X-ray film after air drying. Radiolabelled mixtures of GTP/GDP and GTP/Pi were used as markers."

Pre-formed, epothilone- or GTP\u03b3S-stabilized wild-type or T238A yeast MTs were then introduced into the chamber and allowed to incubate for 10 min, followed by a wash with BRB80 to remove unbound MTs. Solutions containing a range of TOG1 (0.1-\u201310 \u00b5M) or TOG1(R200A) (250, 750 nM) concentrations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) in imaging buffer (BRB80 + 200 nM epothilone + 0.1 mg/mL BSA + antifade reagents (glucose, glucose oxidase, catalase), without the addition of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol [<a href=\"#bib17\">Gell et al., 2010</a>]) were introduced into the chamber immediately prior to data collection. To ensure that the TOG-induced depolymerization was not an artifact of fluorescence imaging, unlabeled wild-type microtubule were assembled as described above but without ReAsH labeling and then imaged with two concentrations of TOG1 using DIC microscopy (black points in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). MT depolymerization reactions with fluorescent microtubules were imaged by epifluoresence microscopy using an Olympus IX81 microscope with a Plan Apo N 60x/1.42 NA objective lens and Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash2.8 CMOS camera, a mercury short arc lamp, and a Texas Red filter cube (Olympus). Reactions were temperature controlled and the microscope was controlled as described above. Images of MT shrinking were recorded every 60 s for about 10 min. MT depolymerization reactions with non-fluorescent wild-type microtubules were imaged using differential interference microscopy as described above. MT length was measured manually using ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>). Average lengths of MT\u2019s were taken over the time course of the movie and were used to determine rate of depolymerization over an hour time span."

After a given time, solutions containing desired tubulin sample and nucleotide of interest, along with 5 or 50 nM Bim1-GFP with imaging buffer described above, were flowed into the chamber. Interactions of Bim1-GFP with MTs were imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus IX81 microscope with a TIRF ApoN 60x/1.49 objective lens, a 491 nm 50 mW solid-state laser and Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash2.8 CMOS camera (Olympus). Reactions were temperature controlled at 30\u00b0C and the microscope was controlled as described above. Axonemes were tracked under DIC and TIRF conditions. Images of MTs were taken over several frames from 15\u201330 min. Bim1-GFP fluorescence intensity along microtubules and extending beyond their growing ends was obtained using the PlotProfile function in ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>).

In mutant cells, the microtubules are highly stabilized, and the purified mutant tubulin forms microtubules that depolymerize very slowly. The authors also determine that subsequent to polymerization, GTP is however hydrolyzed by mutant tubulin more efficiently than in microtubules polymerized from wild type tubulin. Surprisingly, EB1 decoration is not restricted to the microtubule end, suggesting that the conformational change in response to GTP hydrolysis in this mutant is different from that in normal microtubules. Similar behavior is observed for another mutation in helix 7 of beta-tubulin, consistent with prior reports (e.g. Alushin et al, 2014) that this helix is involved in the conformational changes in tubulin following hydrolysis of GTP. This is the first thorough in vitro characterization of a mutation in tubulin that uncouples GTPase cycle reactions from a conformational transition."

Bim1 binding to mutant microtubules is only shown for one Bim1 concentration. Therefore, it remains unclear if simply the overall affinity of Bim1 for microtubule binding is increased or if indeed the relative accumulation at microtubule ends compared to the lattice is reduced/is now absent (as the authors conclude). Experiments with different Bim1 concentrations are needed to distinguish between these two possibilities (effect on overall affinity versus end binding selectivity)."

These errors should be examined in more detail. Ideally, an attempt should be made to collect data points for wildtype microtubules close to its critical concentration using a recently published method (Wieczorek et al., Nat Cell Biol 17, 2015, p. 907)."

However, the new data demonstrate that there is a difference between the mutant GDP microtubule body and the GTP end. This may well indicate that there may also be a difference between the mutant GDP body and the GTPgS body (GTPgS being potentially more similar to the end than to the mutant body). A control experiment with 5 nM Bim1 on GTPgS microtubules is missing. The result of this experiment might require the authors to modify the scheme and adopt a more differentiated view about the microtubule lattice conformations of wt, mutant and GTPgS microtubules."

Lack of saturation was not a factor. A simple thought experiment will illuminate why these data are sufficient to support an argument that the mutation does not lead to substantial change in \u03b1\u03b2\u2212tubulin curvature. Based on our measurements, TOG domains bind approximately 2-fold tighter to \u03b2:T238A \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin than they do to wild-type. A 2-fold difference in binding constant is equivalent to about 0.7 kT of binding energy \u2013 this is a similar order of magnitude as one hydrogen bond, and therefore hard to square with a substantial conformational rearrangement in the mutant. We can also estimate the order of magnitude change in binding affinity we might expect for curved vs straight \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. ~100 nM affinity corresponds to about 16 kT of total binding energy. TOG domains contact both \u03b1- and \u03b2- tubulin when binding to curved \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin, but in straight \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin TOG domains cannot maintain both contacts simultaneously. Making a simplifying assumption that about half of the binding energy (8 kT) will be lost for the straight conformation would correspond to ~3000-fold weaker binding, an estimate that is consistent with the fact that we have not observed significant binding of TOGs to microtubules or detectable binding to \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin by a \u2018half-site\u2019 TOG1 mutant (R200A). Thus, the fitted affinities and their associated errors are not consistent with the idea that there is a substantial mutation-induced change in TOG binding affinity, and this in turn supports our claim that the conformation of the mutant cannot be very different than that of the wild-type. We feel that this is especially so given that we readily detected a change in Bim1 binding affinity for the body of mutant microtubules, and that we also observed a nearly two order of magnitude change in depolymerization rate, all with only small detectable changes in the apparent biochemistry of elongation."

First, we don\u2019t yet have high-resolution structures for wild-type or mutant yeast microtubules, so we can\u2019t know exactly which conformations are involved. Second, yeast microtubules assemble readily using GTPgS but less so with GMPCPP, whereas the opposite is true for vertebrate microtubules \u2013 GTPgS may therefore be promoting different states for the two kinds of microtubules. These factors limit our ability to make detailed structural interpretations, and as mentioned above we have made changes to our language to try to make this clear. Nevertheless, the different Bim1 binding properties of wild-type and mutant microtubules provide strong support for the idea that the mutant retains significant GTP-lattice-like character in a GDP lattice. Encouraging more explanation around these ideas was a good suggestion, and we have added a few sentences along the lines of the above to the end of the Discussion."
