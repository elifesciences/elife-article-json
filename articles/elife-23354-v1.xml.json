This view changed in the early 1990s when a bacterial protein \u2013 that was later identified as a tubulin homolog \u2013 was shown to form a ring-like structure that is essential for bacterial cells to divide (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bi and Lutkenhaus, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus, 1994</a>). It has since been discovered that bacteria and archaea carry homologs for all the components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton \u2013 actin, tubulin and intermediate filaments (<a href=\"#bib9\">Shih and Rothfield, 2006</a>). What is more, we now know that many of these homologs form complex filamentous structures and fulfill similar roles to the cytoskeleton of eukaryotes. This indicates that the cytoskeleton most likely evolved further back in the history of life on Earth than originally thought."

An archaeon called <i>Pyrobaculum calidifontis</i> is believed to be one of the closest living relatives of the ancestral archaea involved in this event (<a href=\"#bib4\">Guy and Ettema, 2011</a>), and has been studied by many researchers.

Interestingly, actin is required for phagocytosis, the process by which a eukaryotic cell engulfs a bacterium. As mentioned above, it is thought a similar mechanism gave rise to the first eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Yutin et al., 2009</a>), and the presence of a working actin-like cytoskeleton in the ancestral archaea would certainly support this idea."

This is the group of archaea to which <i>P. caldifontis</i> belongs and which gives crenactin its name. In <i>P. caldifontis,</i> three proteins encoded by other genes in the arcade cluster \u2013 called arcadin-1, -3, and -4 \u2013 localize with crenactin filaments inside cells, hinting that they might interact. In contrast, arcadin-2 does not co-localize with filaments (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ettema et al., 2011</a>)."

In turn, this explains why arcadin-2 has a different distribution pattern to the other arcadins. Izor\u00e9 et al. then went on to show, using X-ray crystallography, that a fragment of arcadin-2 encompassing its C-terminal portion folds into a helix and binds to crenactin. The binding site corresponds to a site on actin that is used by eukaryotic proteins involved in disassembling filaments."

They also note that the primary sequence of arcadin-2 is unlike that of any actin regulator known to date. This suggests that while the actin cytoskeleton might predate the first eukaryotes, its regulation has been invented independently during evolution. The fact that several, evolutionarily-unrelated proteins use similar mechanisms to fine-tune the polymerization state of actin provides further support for this idea."

Hopefully, these advances will bring us even closer to understanding the evolution of the cytoskeleton."
