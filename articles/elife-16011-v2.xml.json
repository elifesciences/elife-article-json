The severity of the disease depends on the nature of the specific mutation, and whether one or both copies of the gene are affected. Lamin B receptor \u2013 or LBR for short \u2013 is found at the envelope that surrounds the cell\u2019s nucleus and was previously proposed to anchor this envelope to an underlying scaffold to provide it with support. LBR can also catalyze a chemical reaction involved in producing cholesterol \u2013 an essential component of cell membranes. However, this enzymatic activity was assumed to be less important because a second enzyme named TM7SF2 can perform the same reaction. Thus, it was not clear \u2013 at the molecular level \u2013 why the mutations in this gene lead to a variety of diseases."

This fact motivated Tsai, Zhao et al. to reassess the importance of LBR for the production of cholesterol.

As such, these findings challenge the previous assumption that TM7SF2 can compensate for the loss of LBR\u2019s activity and sustain cholesterol synthesis."

The TM7SF2 promoter harbors a sterol response element (SRE) common to most, if not all enzymes implicated in cholesterol synthesis, allowing for the tight regulation of their transcription in response to cholesterol availability (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown and Goldstein, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sharpe and Brown, 2013</a>).

Two congenital disorders are known to be associated with mutations in LBR: Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia (<a href=\"#bib37\">Oosterwijk et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shultz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wassif et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Waterham et al., 2003</a>)\u00a0(see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly is an autosomal dominant disorder in which a single mutation in one LBR allele results in abnormal hypolobulation of granulocyte nuclei (<a href=\"#bib5\">Best et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hoffmann et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shultz et al., 2003</a>). The other human disease associated with LBR, Greenberg skeletal dysplasia, is a perinatally lethal, autosomal recessive condition that results in abnormal bone development, fetal hydrops, and the ultimate nonviability of the fetus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chitayat et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Greenberg et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Horn et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Konstantinidou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Trajkovski et al., 2002</a>).

However, it is unclear whether these diseases are caused by structural changes in the nuclear lamina, or whether they are diseases of cholesterol metabolism (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clayton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Olins et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wassif et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Waterham et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Worman and Bonne, 2007</a>)."

Using a human cell culture model, we demonstrate that it is this function that is perturbed by LBR mutations associated with Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia, suggesting a loss-of-function mechanism for these congenital disorders. Unexpectedly, disease-causing mutations involving C-terminal truncations of LBR lead to their rapid degradation in the nuclear envelope (NE). Such LBR mutants appear to be dislocated from the INM directly into the nucleoplasm, unlike traditional substrates of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, which are eliminated in the cytosol after their dislocation from the ER (<a href=\"#bib9\">Claessen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Vembar and Brodsky, 2008</a>). Metabolically unstable LBR mutant proteins will therefore be informative for future studies aimed at elucidating mechanisms of protein quality control at the nuclear envelope of mammalian cells, a site that was previously experimentally inaccessible due to the absence of suitable model substrates."

We therefore asked whether HeLa, HEK293T and HFF cells expressed both TM7SF2 and LBR under normal and cholesterol-restrictive conditions. For this analysis, we isolated total RNA and prepared protein extracts from these three cell types grown under normal and cholesterol-restrictive conditions. TM7SF2 and LBR transcript levels were quantified via qPCR, and the observed fold change under restrictive conditions was normalized relative to the transcript abundance under normal growth conditions, which was set to one. As expected (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bennati et al., 2006</a>), we found that HFF and HeLa cells upregulated TM7SF2 under starvation conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), whereas LBR was constitutively expressed and unresponsive to cholesterol starvation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Interestingly, HEK293T cells did not materially up-regulate TM7SF2 on the transcript level (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Similar results were obtained when we monitored the LBR and TM7SF2 protein levels via immunoblotting. The abundance of the TM7SF2 protein in HFF and HeLa cells increased under cholesterol-restrictive conditions, whereas HEK293T cells displayed somewhat higher levels of TM7SF2 even under normal conditions but did not upregulate TM7SF2 to the same degree as HFF or HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>)."

To this end, we used the FlpIn gene integration system to generate HeLa cells that express either WT LBR or LBR disease alleles under doxycycline control from the FlpIn locus (<a href=\"#bib54\">Turner et al., 2015</a>). We focused on two LBR point mutations, one frameshift mutation, and one nonsense mutation, the latter of which results in a truncated LBR C-terminus (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Clayton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Konstantinidou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Waterham et al., 2003</a>). The two point mutations, LBR N547D and LBR R583Q (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), are both associated with Greenberg skeletal dysplasia when both LBR alleles are mutated (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clayton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Konstantinidou et al., 2008</a>). Both positions are highly conserved in homologous C14 sterol reductases (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and are not associated with Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly in heterozygous individuals (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clayton et al., 2010</a>). For the LBR truncations, the first frameshift mutation results from a single nucleotide deletion in the C-terminal sterol reductase domain of LBR, c.1402delT, which results in the alteration of downstream codons 468\u2013475 and the formation of a premature stop codon at position 475 (p.Y468TfsX475) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clayton et al., 2010</a>), which we designated LBR 1402T\u0394. This mutation results in\u00a0a C-terminally truncated LBR protein that is missing the final three membrane spanning helices that form the sterol-reductase domain of LBR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and results in Greenberg skeletal dysplasia in homozygous individuals. It is unknown whether individuals heterozygous for the LBR c.1402delT mutation exhibit Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly. The second frameshift mutation causing a distinct C-terminal truncation, LBR c.1599-1605TCTTCTA-&gt;CTAGAAG (LBR p.X534), which we have designated as LBR 1600*, has been shown to cause Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly in heterozygous individuals as well as Greenberg skeletal dysplasia when both LBR alleles are mutated (<a href=\"#bib61\">Waterham et al., 2003</a>). This mutation is a seven nucleotide substitution beginning at LBR position 1599 that directly causes the introduction of a premature stop codon at position LBR p.534, resulting in a truncated LBR C-terminus lacking the final two transmembrane helices of the protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To determine if these mutations are loss-of-function alleles, we expressed each of these as well as wild-type LBR under doxycycline control in our LBR KO HeLa cell line. Cells expressing various LBR alleles in an LBR knockout background were grown under cholesterol-restrictive culture conditions for 7 days. We then imaged and counted the cells and measured total cholesterol content (see Materials and methods). We found that expression of LBR WT from the FlpIn locus completely rescued the growth defect observed for LBR KO cells in cholesterol starvation growth medium (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>). This excluded off-target effects as a cause for the observed phenotype. Importantly, all four disease-associated LBR alleles failed to rescue the observed growth defect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>). LBR KO cells were found to have approximately 40% less total cholesterol content than LBR WT cells after 7 days of cholesterol starvation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Cellular cholesterol content was fully restored to that of WT cells by expression of LBR WT from the FlpIn locus even at somewhat lower LBR expression levels compared to WT cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and E</a>), but not by expression of any of the four disease-associated LBR alleles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). From these data we conclude that LBR KO HeLa cells are strongly compromised for cholesterol production. Neither cell growth nor cellular cholesterol content are restored by the expression of LBR N547D, LBR R583Q, LBR 1402T\u0394 or LBR 1600* in a LBR KO background, indicating that these genetic lesions ultimately result in a failure to sustain cell growth under cholesterol-restrictive conditions."

Indeed, both affected residues are widely conserved in related reductases, including the sterol reductase from <i>Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum</i> (maSR1), the structure of which was recently determined (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2015</a>). Based on a sequence alignment (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the LBR N547 and R583 residues correspond to maSR1 N359 and R395, respectively, both of which map to the NADPH binding pocket, with N359 being implicated in a hydrogen bond formation with a phosphate oxygen of NADPH (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2015</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We therefore tested whether these mutants displayed a reduced affinity for NADPH, the cofactor that contributes the electrons for the reduction reaction. WT LBR, LBR N547D, and LBR 583Q were purified and their NADPH binding affinities measured using a spectroscopic approach (see materials and methods). WT LBR displayed hyperbolic saturation for the cofactor with a K<sub>D</sub> of 24.2 \u00b5M. Both mutants had a severely decreased binding affinity to NADPH, with N547D having the strongest effect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). We attribute this lack of affinity to a possible charge repulsion between the introduced Asp side chain and the negatively charged phosphate of the cofactor. Given that the physiological concentration of NADPH is in the range of ~ 100 \u00b5M\u2013a concentration range at which the discrepancy of cofactor occupancy of LBR and LBR N547D/LBR R583Q would be maximal\u2013 our measurements provide a direct rationale for the inability of those mutants to efficiently rescue the cholesterol auxotrophy (cf. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). As expected, neither LBR N547D nor LBR 583Q transgenes efficiently restored <i>de novo</i> cholesterol synthesis in LBR KO cells, which was monitored by metabolic incorporation of <sup>14</sup>C acetate into cholesterol (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

Given that these cell lines were engineered to express their WT, LBR N547D, or LBR 583Q transgenes to comparable levels, we speculate that the LBR truncation either leads to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the encoding mRNA (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kurosaki and Maquat, 2016</a>), or that the proteins themselves are recognized as aberrant and degraded by a cellular protein quality-control system (<a href=\"#bib28\">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</a>)."

Both mutants were significantly stabilized by MG132, with minimal degradation taking place in 60 min after synthesis. We conclude that the degradation of truncated LBR variants depends on the proteasome. Notably, the kinetics of LBR 1402T\u0394 and LBR 1600* degradation were remarkably rapid, with half-lives of 10\u201315\u2009min, especially considering that these mutant derivatives are polytopic membrane proteins.

Since the levels of unmodified LBR WT far exceed those of LBR 1402T\u0394 and LBR 1600* (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, lower panel), these data reflect a disproportionate increase in abundance of ubiquitylated LBR species for the disease-associated variants relative to LBR WT.

A minor portion of LBR1600* is degraded by the canonical ERAD pathway in the ER, whereas the majority will enter the nucleus by virtue of the correctly folded N-terminal domain and be retained by binding to the nuclear lamina. Here, a presumably ERAD-independent pathway is operative, involving both p97 and the Ub/proteasome.

We found LBR to be essential for survival under cholesterol-restrictive growth conditions in three different human cell types (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures\u00a02C</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig3\">3A\u2013D</a>). Correspondingly, LBR-deficient HeLa cells cannot efficiently synthesize cholesterol (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), but are readily rescued by the addition of LDL particles or free cholesterol to the cholesterol starvation medium (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These results are unexpected since previous studies in mice reported that the sterol reductase activities of LBR and TM7SF2 are functionally redundant, suggesting that HEM dysplasia is likely a laminopathy that is unrelated to the sterol reductase activity of LBR (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wassif et al., 2007</a>). In cultured HeLa cells, however, LBR does not play a significant role in NE organization despite being a constitutively expressed, abundant INM component (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), possibly due to functional redundancy with some of the multitude of other lamina-associated membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hetzer and Wente, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schirmer and Gerace, 2005</a>). In our opinion, a major role for TM7SF2 in generic cholesterol synthesis is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an overt phenotype upon deletion of TM7SF2 in mice, which are not compromised in cholesterol synthesis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bennati et al., 2008</a>). In fact, TM7SF2 is expressed under cholesterol-restrictive conditions in all tested human cell lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>), but cannot compensate for the absence of LBR. Nevertheless, it is striking that mice lacking a fully functional LBR allele due to homozygous mutations at the ichthyosis locus (<i>ic/ic</i>) are viable, although these animals display numerous phenotypic abnormalities including alopecia, syndactyly and hydrocephalus as well as an increase in embryonic lethality (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shultz et al., 2003</a>). Growth defects were also observed in primary cells isolated from mouse models with mutations in the <i>LBR</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib50\">Subramanian et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Verhagen et al., 2012</a>).

Since <i>D. melanogaster</i> is a cholesterol-auxotrophic organism, we speculate that additional LBR functions could involve the N-terminal Tudor domain. While we found this domain to be dispensable for cholesterol synthesis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), a possible role could involve heterochromatin organiziation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Solovei et al., 2013</a>), which may be related to the nuclear abnormalities observed in e.g. Pelger-Huet anomaly (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hoffmann et al., 2002</a>) and mouse models of ichtyosis (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shultz et al., 2003</a>).

The administration of a low cholesterol diet or inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis in animal models with <i>LBR</i> mutations could reveal previously unknown phenotypes and thus provide new insight into disease etiology.

Given that INM-resident proteins are synthesized in the ER prior to their targeting to the INM (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lusk et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ungricht and Kutay, 2015</a>), we propose that the correctly folded N-terminal moiety of LBR containing INM targeting information (<a href=\"#bib47\">Smith and Blobel, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Soullam and Worman, 1993</a>) leads to the rapid trafficking of LBR 1600* to the INM before elements of the ERAD pathway can act (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Considering that near-quantitative nuclear accumulation of an HA-tagged LBR variant is achieved in ~20\u2009min (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ungricht et al., 2015</a>), and that the half life of LBR 1600* is ~10\u201315\u2009min, it follows that a significant fraction of LBR 1600* escapes the ERAD system leading to localization to the INM mediated by the intact N-terminal domain, which confers lamin binding (see. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a> demonstrating INM localization of LBR 1600* under steady-state conditions). Upon arrival of LBR 1600* at the INM, a system analogous to but distinct from the known ERAD system is responsible for the ubiquitylation of LBR 1600* and its p97-dependent extraction from the INM (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">9</a>). Based on the unusually rapid kinetics and substantial protein accumulation in a dislocated nuclear state in presence of MG132, we believe that the INM degradative system is different from the established ERAD machinery."

The NADPH binding measurement was performed using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of LBR. In short, 150 \u00b5l of 10 \u00b5M purified LBR was titrated by increasing concentration of NADPH in elution buffer (20\u2009mM HEPES, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 5\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5\u2009mM KCl, 0.01% (w/v) n-dodecyl-D-maltoside (DDM) pH 7.5). Fluorescence decrease (Ex:295 nm / Em:335 nm) upon NADPH addition was recorded on a spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International) at 20\u00b0C and further corrected for the inner filter effect (<a href=\"#bib63\">Woodyer et al., 2005</a>). The fluorescence change was plotted against NADPH concentration and non-linearly fitted using GraphPad Prism."

This isoform does not have a single mutation. Given that the TM7SF2 protein in HeLa cells co-migrates (on SDS gels) with TM7SF2 proteins detected in HFFs and other cell lines (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>), we conclude that the longer isoform 1 is the major TM7SF2 gene product in several cell types. The sequencing results are included as new <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>. Please note also the newly added data showing that HFFs and HEK 293s similarly rely on LBR to sustain cholesterol synthesis (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013F</a>).

We believe that this range reflects a viability threshold, i.e. cell death ensues at lower concentrations of cholesterol, making it impossible to accurately quantify this effect and to deconvolute the contribution of de novo synthesis. We have therefore implemented metabolic labeling techniques as suggested by the reviewer to directly measure de novo synthesis using <sup>14</sup>C acetate in conjunction with thin layer chromatography/autoradiography. We are most grateful for the reviewer's suggestion since the resulting data are a clear \u201cblack and white\u201d result and are even more convincing than the original data. LBR-deficient cells or those that express disease mutants are in fact completely deficient in de novo synthesis of cholesterol (new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5E</a>). Given our newly added data demonstrating that HeLa cells express TM7SF2 devoid of coding mutations in an LBR deficient background, these data reinforce our central conclusion that LBR is essential for cholesterol synthesis despite the presence of TM7SF2."

Indeed, most of the data in this study are based on carefully controlled expression levels using defined genetic loci for expression of transgenes at near-endogenous expression levels. However, we want to point out that much of the published literature in the protein turnover/ERAD field relies on strongly overexpressed proteins since it is otherwise difficult to achieve robustly detectable levels of metabolically unstable proteins. Please note that neither LBR1600* nor LBR1400T are detectable under steady-state conditions in immunoblots (cf. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) since they are rapidly degraded, forcing us to increase expression by using a strong promoter to reach the detection limit of immunoblots in our ubiquitin-relevant experiments. Please also note that even when overexpressed, the levels of LBR1600* and LBR1400T are significantly lower than endogenous LBR (see <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 1</a> in which we compare endogenous levels of LBR to the input lysates used for the IP experiments in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Given that overexpressed LBR WT, which we included as control, is not degraded at much higher levels of expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and displays only negligible levels of ubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), we hope the reviewer will agree that overexpression cannot account for the ubiquitination or the metabolic instability of LBR mutant derivatives. We have also repeated the pulse-chase experiments that were originally based on transient transfection of LBR1600* and LBR1400T into LBR KO cells. Our new data, which are based on stable cell lines expressing of LBR1600* and LBR1400T at levels below the detection limits of immunoblots (cf. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), faithfully recapitulate our previous result (i.e. rapid turnover/MG132-sensitivity). We have therefore replaced the original panels in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>/D by these new panels representing our recent data obtained at near-endogenous/lower expression levels."

In accordance with the published literature (Biochim Biophys Acta. 2006 Jul;1761(<a href=\"#bib6\">7</a>):677-85), we found that TM7SF2 expression is induced in response to cholesterol starvation (cf. point #1), while LBR is constitutively expressed and not significantly up-regulated (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G-I</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3 \u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As expected, induction of TM7SF2 expression depends on SREBP2, as judged by a significant reduction of TM7SF2 expression in SREBP2-silenced cells relative to a non-targeting siRNA control. Similar results were obtained for HMGCoAR, LDM and NSDHL. We have not included all of these data in the manuscript since the revision has increased the size of manuscript tremendously, and a detailed analysis of transcriptional control is outside the scope of our study. We also generalized our findings by including HFFs and HEK 293T cells in this analysis (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G, H</a>)."
