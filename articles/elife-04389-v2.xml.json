We have examined the mechanism of WNV fusion and sought evidence for potential intermediates during the conformational transition by following hemifusion of WNV virus-like particles (VLPs) in a single particle format. We have introduced specific mutations into E, to relate their influence on fusion kinetics to structural features of the protein. At the level of individual E subunits, trimer formation and membrane engagement of the threefold clustered fusion loops are rate-limiting. Hemifusion requires at least two adjacent trimers. Simulation of the kinetics indicates that availability of competent monomers within the contact zone between virus and target membrane makes trimerization a bottleneck in hemifusion. We discuss the implications of the model we have derived for mechanisms of membrane fusion in other contexts."

We have examined the mechanism of WNV fusion and sought evidence for potential intermediates during the conformational transition by following hemifusion of WNV virus-like particles (VLPs) in a single particle format. We have introduced specific mutations into E, to relate their influence on fusion kinetics to structural features of the protein. At the level of individual E subunits, trimer formation and membrane engagement of the threefold clustered fusion loops are rate-limiting. Hemifusion requires at least two adjacent trimers. Simulation of the kinetics indicates that availability of competent monomers within the contact zone between virus and target membrane makes trimerization a bottleneck in hemifusion. We discuss the implications of the model we have derived for mechanisms of membrane fusion in other contexts."

Once the virus has attached to the host cell membrane, it becomes engulfed within a bubble-like structure called an endosome, which also has a surrounding membrane. The interior of an endosome is acidic. Under these conditions the E protein undergoes a series of changes that bring the two membranes into close contact, so that the membrane of the virus can fuse with the membrane of the endosome. This membrane fusion allows the genome of the virus to escape the endosome and hijack the cell to make new copies of the virus."

Domain I is a central <b>\u03b2-</b>barrel that positions the other two domains; domain II, two long, clustered extensions from domain I, bears the fusion loop at its distal tip; domain III is an immunoglobulin-like domain that may have a receptor-binding surface. In the prefusion, neutral-pH conformation, a cavity at the junction between domains I and III sequesters the fusion loop of the E dimer partner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Protonation of key histidine residues induces dimer dissociation, exposing the fusion loop and allowing the ectodomain to hinge outwards from the virion surface (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fritz et al., 2008</a>).

Kinetic data can define rate-limiting steps preceding an observed process, and coupled with site-directed mutation they can identify key intermediates (<a href=\"#bib9\">Floyd et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ivanovic et al., 2013</a>). We have used this approach to probe the conformational transition of WNV E on the virion surface. Our data support a mechanism in which a pH-dependent dimer-monomer equilibrium creates, at the contact between virus and target membrane, a pool of monomers competent to cluster into target-membrane engaged trimers. Formation of at least two adjacent trimers allows progression to hemifusion. The corresponding two-stage structural picture is (i) that stochastic activation of E monomers (by dimer dissociation and monomer outward extension) leads to trimerization and essentially irreversible target-membrane engagement, whenever three neighboring monomers are active, and (ii) that two adjacent trimers can together exert enough force on the membranes they bridge (target membrane and viral membrane) to produce a hemifusion stalk. Formation of adjacent trimers is limited by the availability of competent monomers. This mechanism\u2014like the one shown previously to fit influenza-virus fusion kinetics\u2014does not require defined trimer\u2013trimer interactions, because resistance of the two membranes to deformation toward a hemifusion stalk couples conformational changes in the trimers that bridge them (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ivanovic et al., 2013</a>). Fusion proceeds rapidly whenever a sufficient number of them can overcome the deformation barrier. We suggest that this description may apply more generally to fusion of intracellular vesicles and to fusion of two cells."

We found a unique set of parameters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) that generated histograms very similar in shape and in pH-dependence of dwell time to our experimental data from WNV VLPs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The three values we varied were <i>k</i><sub><i>act</i></sub>, <i>k</i><sub><i>tri</i></sub> and <i>k</i><sub><i>comp</i></sub>. We converged on these parameters following sequential rounds of optimization, testing fits for conditions in which one, two or three trimers defined hemifusion. We also tested a range of values for P<sub>dim</sub> from 2\u201350, thus altering the cooperativity of subunit activation, and values for T from 1 to 3. We found that the data fit best to models in which two trimers mediate hemifusion and that this number was insensitive to the assumed pK<sub>a</sub> for monomer activation and to the assumed threshold pH for trimer formation. We investigated if accounting for cooperativity between a subunit and its neighbors in the surface lattice other than its dimer partner would alter the outcome of our simulations. Incorporation of an additional factor did not make any changes in the properties of the simulation histograms and their fits. For all subsequent simulations, we fixed the parameter <i>P</i><sub><i>dim</i></sub> = 4, well within the tested range. With these parameters, the rate-limiting step is trimer formation. We noticed that as we increased the pH in these simulations, we lowered the yield of total particles reaching hemifusion during the fixed time frame of the simulation. We found the same trend in the experimental data (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In the simulations, the lower yield came from a reduced pool of activated monomer available to form trimers and a resulting geometric penalty for trimer possibilities. Relaxing this constraint, by increasing the target patch size to 37 monomers, increased overall event yield in the simulation; decreasing the target patch size to 23 decreased the yield (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

The interaction contributes to robust trimer formation in vitro of secreted, soluble TBEV E ectodomain (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allison et al., 1999</a>). We measured the bulk fusion activity for F408V and found no variation in pH threshold, ruling out any global effect of the mutations on proton binding and restricting potential variation in the simulation parameters corresponding to <i>k</i><sub><i>tri</i></sub> and <i>k</i><sub><i>comp</i></sub> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). An F408V mutation in WNV VLPs slowed hemifusion at pH 5.5, broadening and extending the distribution of hemifusion delay times from a roughly single-exponential fall-off for wild-type at that pH (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, top right panel) to a rise-and-decay approximated reasonably by a two-step gamma distribution (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Under conditions expected to speed up the overall reaction (pH 5.0, 22\u00b0C), the F408V mutation reduced the single exponential rate for the distribution of dwell times from that of WT (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Simulations in which the trimerization rate constant (<i>k</i><sub><i>tri</i></sub>) for the F408V mutant was set to one-tenth its best value for the wild-type simulation generated a good fit to the observed hemifusion times, when all other parameters were held constant (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>).

The affected step in the simulation (trimerization) is consistent with the known contacts of F408 in the trimeric intermediate and with the known trimerization properties of E when those interactions are absent (<a href=\"#bib14\">Pangerl et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Klein et al., 2013</a>)."

In the post-fusion conformation, N193 makes a ring of hydrogen bonds in the center of the domain II trimer contact, where it probably contributes to clustering of the fusion loops. WNV N193A VLPs showed no change in bulk fusion threshold. Yet, single particle data of the WNV N193A mutant broadened the distribution of hemifusion delay times for the VLPs at pH 5.5, although somewhat less markedly than F408V (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Under conditions in which the reaction slows (pH 6.25, 18\u00b0C), the N193A data further broaden to a distribution of hemifusion times that fits a process with two steps of equal rate (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>).

The rate-limiting step in the hemagglutinin (HA) conformational change is exposure of the fusion peptide and its engagement with the target bilayer. The contact zone between a typical influenza virus particle and the membrane with which it will fuse includes about 100 closely packed HA trimers. When the pH drops, stochastic rearrangement of trimers within that contact zone creates a random pattern of extended HA bridges between the two membranes. The extended intermediates have a detectable lifetime only because hydration force and resistance to membrane deformation prevent collapse of any single trimer to a postfusion conformation. The free energy recovered from collapse of three neighboring trimers is enough to overcome this barrier, and rapid collapse and hemifusion ensue as soon as three adjacent trimers in the contact zone have created intermembrane bridges."

E dimers, which initially form a regular icosahedral array, dissociate, exposing the fusion loops at the tip of domain II and allowing the subunits to project outwards from the virion surface. These events are fast, and under many conditions they may be in rapid equilibrium. Our results, both from experiment and simulation, suggest that the rate-limiting molecular step is formation of extended trimers. This conclusion is consistent with observations on low-pH induced trimer formation from soluble E ectodomain dimers: liposomes greatly enhance the yield of trimers, probably by transiently immobilizing the monomers in the right orientation. The rate of trimerization depends in turn on the effective surface concentration of activated monomers in the contact zone between virus particle and target membrane, and the rate of hemifusion, on the occurrence of a suitable number (at least two) of adjacent trimers within that zone. Since activation of individual monomers is stochastic, a critical constraint comes from the geometric requirements for availability of activated E to trimerize."

Our single particle analysis has extracted mechanistic detail from mutants that have no detectible bulk phenotype. The observed increase in single particle hemifusion yield at higher temperatures (\u223c40% at 24\u00b0C) suggests that local rearrangements in the particle surface can help satisfy the geometric requirements for trimerization, increasing overall yield with little change in overall reaction rate (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013E</a>). Experimental data for the 1:1 WT:W101A mixed particle showed no decrease in hemifusion yield (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). A likely explanation is that mixed trimers, with one or two Trp-containing fusion loops, can participate in facilitating hemifusion, perhaps in some cases with participation of a third trimer. A simulation assuming that any trimer with one or more mutated E monomers would be inactive greatly decreases yield, while relaxing this constraint recovers wild-type levels, as observed experimentally (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>)."

Fast (ms) synaptic vesicular membrane fusion proceeds by rearrangement of multiple copies of the trans-membrane SNAP/SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Takamori et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hernandez et al., 2014</a>), docked in a poised state analogous to the fusion-loop inserted, extended E-protein intermediate (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). The synaptic fusion machinery may also act in a stochastic fashion, in which a minimum number of complexes are sufficient to catalyze fusion. Although subsequent events are very fast, the poised state precedes any membrane merger: the two bilayers remain distinct until triggering, and activation by calcium-dependent co-factors allows coordinated, rapid progression from the extended state to full pore formation, probably through a transient hemifusion stalk (<a href=\"#bib6\">Diao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lai et al., 2014</a>). The pre-assembly step in synaptic vesicle fusion thus avoids the penalty imposed on viral fusion by the requirement that a critical number of neighboring bridges accumulate <i>after</i> the triggering event (increased proton concentration) before they can zipper and collapse."

Moreover, both have high local protein density within the bilayer\u2014at least 15% for flaviviruses and nearly 25% for synpatic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib31\">Takamori et al., 2006</a>). We find that WNV VLP fusion kinetics are independent of particle size and hence of curvature within the relevant range, which spans a substantial difference in outer:inner area ratios. The area of the outer polar-group layer in small VLPs is nearly three times that of the inner polar-group layer; the ratio is just over 1.5 for the virion-sized particles. The wedge-shaped transmembrane hairpins of M and E, neither of which extends fully into the lumen of the particle, may compensate in part for curvature and help drive budding into the ER; insertion of amphipathic \u03b13 of the stem into the outer leaflet of the bilayer, occupying about 10% of the total outer-leaflet surface area, probably stabilizes curvature as well. With these compensations, even the rather sharp curvature of the small VLPs probably contributes very little to overcoming the barrier to fusion. A potential contribution to catalyzing membrane merger is the perturbation in the target membrane that comes from introducing fusion loops or fusion peptides into its lipid bilayer. The heterogeneity of fusion-loop and fusion-peptide structures and sequences among the various kinds of enveloped viruses appears, however, to rule out a common mechanism for such a disturbance. Our analysis therefore concentrates on the distortions imposed by linking large-scale conformational changes in the fusion protein with comparably strong deformations of the lipid bilayers."

The requirement that several neighboring monomers undergo domain rearrangements to assemble into trimers implies that the extended conformation will have a finite lifetime and that blocking trimerization will markedly reduce the likelihood of hemifusion. The potency of exogenous stem-derived peptide inhibitors of dengue virus (<a href=\"#bib28\">Schmidt et al., 2010</a>) suggests that these properties provide an inhibitory strategy yet to be fully exploited by conformation-specific targeted antibodies or small-molecule inhibitors."

Solvent refractive index and viscosity parameters were defined using the instrument PBS standard values. We calibrated the instrument using polystyrene beads (5 nm radius), tomato busy stunt virus in compact and expanded states (R = 170 \u00c5 and 190 \u00c5, respectively), and rotavirus double-layered particle as standards (350 \u00c5 radius). Each data point is the average of three measurements, each of which was determined by twenty consecutive 10 s acquisitions Data were filtered based on stability of light intensity and sample polydispersity criteria (&lt;20%) with the program DYNAMICS v6 for data analysis."

Dimer dissociation is not the only low pH-dependent stage in fusion, and other pH-dependent stages (including the trimerization step that is found by the authors to depend on pH with pH 6.1 threshold) can contribute to or determine the observed pH dependence of fusion. Furthermore, for the same viral fusogen, pH threshold for lipid mixing can depend on the specifics of the assay (for instance, Wessels et al., 2007, Biophys. J., 93, 526; <a href=\"#bib23\">Moesker et al., 2010</a>, Journal of General Virology, 91, 389) and on the composition of the target membrane (for instance, Gollins &amp; Porterfield, 1986, Journal of General Virology. 67, 157). Thus, pK of the dimer dissociation step can differ from pH threshold of lipid mixing, and it is important to examine whether small changes in the pK for K<sub>dm</sub> would yield better fits with 1 or 3 trimers mediating hemifusion or 2 trimers would remain the best fit."
