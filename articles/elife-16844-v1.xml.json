Here, using large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screening, we find that KDM3A, a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) mono- and di-demethylase, plays a pivotal role in anoikis induction. In attached breast epithelial cells, <i>KDM3A</i> expression is maintained at low levels by integrin signaling. Following detachment, integrin signaling is decreased resulting in increased <i>KDM3A</i> expression. RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>KDM3A</i> substantially reduces apoptosis following detachment and, conversely, ectopic expression of <i>KDM3A</i> induces cell death in attached cells. We find that KDM3A promotes anoikis through transcriptional activation of <i>BNIP3</i> and <i>BNIP3L</i>, which encode pro-apoptotic proteins. Using mouse models of breast cancer metastasis we show that knockdown of <i>Kdm3a</i> enhances metastatic potential. Finally, we find defective <i>KDM3A</i> expression in human breast cancer cell lines and tumors. Collectively, our results reveal a novel transcriptional regulatory program that mediates anoikis."
