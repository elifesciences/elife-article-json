Microtubules are built from protein subunits called \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin and abruptly switch between growing and shrinking. This switching property is known as \"dynamic instability\", and has captivated scientists since it was discovered over 30 years ago (<a href=\"#bib5\">Horio and Hotani, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</a>)."

Catastrophe occurs when the microtubule loses its stabilizing cap,\u00a0which\u00a0is a biochemically distinct region near the growing end. Despite substantial efforts, both the size of this stabilizing cap and its relationship to microtubule growth rates have remained obscure. Now, in eLife, Thomas Surrey and co-workers at the Francis Crick Institute and the London Centre for Nanotechnology \u2013 including Christian Duellberg as first author \u2013 use state-of-the-art methods to resolve these longstanding conundrums (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Duellberg et al., 2016</a>)."
