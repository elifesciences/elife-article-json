                    "text": "Zolpidem produces paradoxical recovery of speech, cognitive and motor functions in select subjects with severe brain injury but underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In three diverse patients with known zolpidem responses we identify a distinctive pattern of EEG dynamics that suggests a mechanistic model. In the absence of zolpidem, all subjects show a strong low frequency oscillatory peak \u223c6\u201310 Hz in the EEG power spectrum most prominent over frontocentral regions and with high coherence (\u223c0.7\u20130.8) within and between hemispheres. Zolpidem administration sharply reduces EEG power and coherence at these low frequencies. The \u223c6\u201310 Hz activity is proposed to arise from intrinsic membrane properties of pyramidal neurons that are passively entrained across the cortex by locally-generated spontaneous activity. Activation by zolpidem is proposed to arise from a combination of initial direct drug effects on cortical, striatal, and thalamic populations and further activation of underactive brain regions induced by restoration of cognitively-mediated behaviors."

In three diverse patients with known zolpidem responses we identify a distinctive pattern of EEG dynamics that suggests a mechanistic model. In the absence of zolpidem, all subjects show a strong low frequency oscillatory peak \u223c6\u201310 Hz in the EEG power spectrum most prominent over frontocentral regions and with high coherence (\u223c0.7\u20130.8) within and between hemispheres. Zolpidem administration sharply reduces EEG power and coherence at these low frequencies. The \u223c6\u201310 Hz activity is proposed to arise from intrinsic membrane properties of pyramidal neurons that are passively entrained across the cortex by locally-generated spontaneous activity. Activation by zolpidem is proposed to arise from a combination of initial direct drug effects on cortical, striatal, and thalamic populations and further activation of underactive brain regions induced by restoration of cognitively-mediated behaviors."

All subjects were more than 12 months post-injury and had histories of zolpidem response and regular usage of the drug for behavioral facilitation. Despite the wide differences in the etiology of brain injury across subjects, quantitative analysis of resting EEG dynamics reveals a striking commonality of spectral features in the absence of zolpidem, and stereotyped changes in these spectral quantities when the drug is administered."

As a first step, the zolpidem-induced behavioral responses were confirmed by formal assessments of behavior ON and OFF drug by the research teams (\u2018Methods\u2019). For subjects 1 and 3, this assessment was made with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, a well-established, standardized rating scale for patients with disorders of consciousness (<a href=\"#bib13\">Giacino et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Seel et al., 2010</a>); the CRS-R captures variations in cognitively-mediated behaviors up to a level of reliable and consistent communication through speech or gesture.

For assessments in the OFF-drug period (the first assessment, which followed a 62-hr washout, and at every time point that was at least 4 hr after zolpidem administration), the total CRS-R score ranged from 10\u201315. After each administration of zolpidem, the CRS-R score rose to ceiling (total score = 23). This change in CRS-R total score reflects improvements in all subscales, including recovery of functional movements, consistent communication, and elements of executive function. Additional changes not captured by this psychometric instrument included recovery of fluent verbal communication, writing and complex organized movements such as assembling block structures to match arbitrary configurations (see \u2018Clinical histories\u2019 for further clinical details and additional neuropsychological assessments).

During all baseline assessments the patient demonstrated no evidence of command following or a communication system (CRS-R communication subscale score 0). Across three assessments of baseline behavior OFF drug after overnight periods and a 62 hr washout period at the onset of the study total CRS-R scores ranged from 10\u201315 reflecting a lack of goal-directed behaviors, evidence of any communication systems either verbal or gestural, nor consistent response to command following. Across two assessments of baseline behavior at least 4 hr after a prior dose of zolpidem within a day (reflecting typical duration of action of the medication) maximal total CRS-R scores of 18 reflected evidence of command following with inaccurate communication and higher level motor function (CRS-R subscale motor score of 6) or consistent auditory command following (CRS-R auditory subscale score of 4). Compared with these baseline behavioral assessments, consistent achievement of a maximum possible total CRS-R scores of 23 was obtained during all ON drug periods reflecting a state in which the patient consistently demonstrated behavioral levels not captured by this psychometric instrument including recovery of consistent communication, fluent verbal communication, writing and complex organized movements (see \u2018Clinical histories\u2019 for further clinical details and additional neuropsychological assessments). As seen in graph, a maximal total CRS-R scores consistently appeared following drug administration within approximately 1 hr and had a variable duration of maintenance with second daily dose of the medication showing extended time periods of maximal total scores.

These behavioral responses, however, could only be elicited with vigorous arousal enhancing maneuvers. After zolpidem administration on a single formal assessment, CRS-R score increased from 15 to 16. This one-point change reflected a change in the CRS-R arousal subscale score from 1 to 2: a shift from a state that required constant stimulation to maintain arousal to a state characterized by spontaneous eye-opening and behavioral responsiveness. Other CRS-R subscale scores did not change but no longer depended on external stimulation to elicit responsiveness. In addition, the subject also showed increased alertness (as judged by orientation to sensory stimuli) and agitated movements, with an increase in speech rate and words that were subjectively rated as more intelligible (see \u2018Methods\u2019 Clinical Histories)."

Comparison of the anterior and posterior channels in both subjects reveal a consistent finding of lower resting average low frequency in anterior channels typically \u223c7.4 Hz. In <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> , the average center frequency for anterior EEG channels in Subject 1 ranges from 7.1 Hz to 7.4 Hz, while posterior EEG channels show a higher average center frequency ranging from 7.5 Hz to 8.3 Hz. A sharper difference for anterior and posterior EEG channels is seen in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> for Subject 2; for this subject, anterior EEG channels show an average center frequency of \u223c7.4 Hz for four of the five measured baselines , with the notable exception of the second baseline measurement. The second baseline measurement in Subject 2 occurred early in morning (8:30AM) and may reflect an independent influence of arousal state, as a similar effect of increased baseline 15\u201330 Hz power is seen for this pre-dose baseline (refer to <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and discussion below).

For the shortest washout intervals (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1 and 2</a>), however, the posterior channels demonstrate a persistent shift in the average center frequency suggesting a carry-over effect for these regions of the brain.

In some instances increased power in the \u223c15\u201330 Hz range is also apparent before and after the drug administration. This variation is substantial and suggests a fluctuation in the baseline state possibly linked to differences in arousal state or other factors not controlled for in this observational study. For Subject 2, a marked change in the power spectrum in the \u223c15\u201330 Hz range is limited primarily to the first dose which followed a 20 hr washout period and was received late in the afternoon (4:30 PM), suggesting that the regular dosing schedule in this subject of three doses per day may produce carry-over effects that diminish once the subject is off drug for more extended time periods. In addition to diurnal arousal effects, carry-over effects also appear to affect the 15\u201330 Hz component as a broad \u223c15\u201330 Hz peak also remains present in this range for the shortest washout baselines in Subject 1 (4 hr; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

By 2 hr after dosing, the enhanced high-frequency power has noticeably decayed. In contrast, both subjects show suppression of low-frequency power beyond this point (up to 3 hr in subject 1, and up to 4 hr in subject 2), suggesting that the prolonged effect on low-frequency activity may underlie the \u2018carry-over\u2019 effect.

Here we studied three such patients with disparate etiologies of brain injury, who had very different underlying patterns of structural brain injury and mechanisms of widespread neuronal death and disconnection. Despite these differences, quantitative EEG analysis revealed strikingly consistent dynamical signatures of brain dynamics in the resting awake state, and how these dynamics were affected by zolpidem. In all subjects, resting EEG power spectra in the baseline state revealed an abnormal peak at \u223c6\u201310 Hz and high coherence in this same frequency range across intra- and inter-hemispheric brain regions. Behavioral activation with zolpidem reliably attenuated \u223c6\u201310 Hz power and coherence in all subjects and associated with an increase in power at \u223c15\u201330 Hz. These findings suggest a fundamental similarity in the dynamics of brain states that are poised to elicit a zolpidem response. Below we propose a physiological basis for these common resting state dynamics identified by our EEG findings in the OFF drug state that show specific correspondence with known physiological processes. We further discuss a key prediction of this model: that changes observed in EEG spectral content during activation in the ON drug state will covary with the degree of structural and functional deafferentation of the cerebral cortex."

Testing these ideas, however, goes far beyond the scope of the present study, as it would require a large structured, prospective, randomized clinical trial (<a href=\"#bib46\">Whyte and Myers, 2009</a>).

The implications of severe deafferentation of cortical neurons for EEG dynamics can be estimated by comparing two extremes: completely de-afferented \u2018slabs\u2019 of cortical tissue, and normal cortical tissue. In the former case (in vivo studies of completely deafferented \u2018slabs\u2019), neocortical neurons typically have an intracellular potential of \u223c-70 mV and the dominant frequency of activity measured in far field potentials is \u223c1 Hz (<a href=\"#bib43\">Timofeev et al., 2000</a>). Intact, fully connected neocortical neurons have an average membrane potential in active wakeful states, that ranges from \u223c\u221265 to \u221255 mV (<a href=\"#bib40\">Steriade, 2001</a>) and the dominant frequency of far-field potentials is in the 8\u201312 Hz range. Given these benchmarks it is reasonable to assume that in our patient subjects, all with very significant but incomplete deafferentation, that average membrane potentials are intermediate between these conditions. In this context, the prominent low frequency peaks seen across the power spectra from anterior EEG channels and across different OFF drug baselines of \u223c7.4 Hz are notable for comparison to findings from in vitro studies of spontaneous oscillations generated by neocortical pyramidal cells. Silva et al. (<a href=\"#bib39\">Silva et al., 1991</a>) identified that nearly identical frequencies of sustained firing lasting over seconds (7.4 Hz SD +/\u22120.6) are produced by layer V neocortical pyramidal cells in response to very brief (4 ms) current pulses. These sustained oscillations could be initiated under physiologic conditions in vitro that maintain intrinsic membrane potentials near firing threshold at \u223c\u221260\u201365 mV (<a href=\"#bib39\">Silva et al., 1991</a>). As seen in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1 and 2</a>, an average center frequency of 7.4 Hz (\u223cSD +/\u22120.6) characterizes all but one of nine separately measured baselines across the anterior EEG channels of Subjects 1 and 2."

In the slice preparation, increases in membrane depolarization with stronger and more sustained injected currents produced shifts of these intrinsically generated oscillatory firing patterns toward higher frequencies (up to 12 Hz) when kept below firing threshold (<a href=\"#bib39\">Silva et al., 1991</a>) indicating that a wider range of frequencies beyond 7.4 Hz could in principle still reflect such pathologically driven oscillations (and in Subject 3 the resting oscillations tend to be at higher frequencies as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1 and 3C</a>). Moreover, fully depolarizing these neurons in the slice results in similar shifts to \u223c15\u201330 Hz firing rates (<a href=\"#bib39\">Silva et al., 1991</a>)."

According to this principle, when oscillators with similar frequencies interact weakly, stable synchronization around a consensus frequency is the generic result. Here, we hypothesize that the net effects of residual Layer V output neurons (efferent to other cortical regions either directly or via subcortical structures) constitute a weak coupling. The predicted result is widespread coherence of cortical columns at a consensus theta frequency (\u223c7.4 Hz), as we in fact observe in all three subjects."

Slower frequencies and lack of a change in frequency in response to sensory stimulation are associated with worse outcomes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Young et al., 1994</a>), consistent with the notion that this activity results from de-afferentation, and the dominant frequency range indexes its severity."

For example, somewhat similar increases in theta power observed in the resting MEG signal recorded from patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, obsessive compulsive disorder and other syndromes have been proposed to arise in the setting of less severe deafferentation and disfacilitation of thalamic neurons producing a \u2018thalamocortical dysrhymia\u2019 syndrome (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jeanmonod et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Llin\u00e1s et al., 1999</a>).

Specifically, experimental and clinical studies of thalamocortical dysrrhythmia link abnormal increases in theta power to coincident abnormal increases 15\u201330 Hz activity produced by lateral inhibition in the cortex (\u2018edge effect\u2019, Llin\u00e1s et al., 1999; Llin\u00e1s et al., 2005). Of note, the linkage of elevated 4\u201310 Hz and 15\u201330 Hz activity has been observed in a study of a zolpidem responsive stroke patient subject (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hall et al., 2010</a>). <a href=\"#bib17\">Hall et al.(2010)</a> studied MEG signals in a fully conscious, alert, and cognitively normal patient subject with mild aphasia and diminished sensorimotor integration ; these investigators reported that zolpidem administration produced similar changes of power suppression in co-localized areas of abnormally increased 4\u201310 Hz activity and increased 15\u201330 Hz activity in the resting MEG signal measured near the boundaries of a large stroke lesion within the damaged hemisphere. This suppression of increased high frequency power with zolpidem is exactly opposite to the changes observed in \u223c15\u201340 Hz power in our subjects and indicates that a different mechanism underlies the changes seen in the present study, compared to that underlying the resting MEG activity in the Hall et al. subject (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hall et al., 2010</a>). In the latter subject, global cerebral structures, including both thalami, remained intact and the patient\u2019s state of consciousness was normal (and there also was no history of a preceding disorder of consciousness). Moreover, in the Hall et al. study, no increases were observed in \u223c15\u201340 Hz power outside of MEG channels with abnormal 3\u20137 Hz power (where \u223c15\u201340 Hz suppressed with zolpidem administration). Since the elevated theta and beta activity seen in the Hall et al. study was focal, it is more likely to be due to bursting of a localized set of deafferented thalamic neurons (i.e., thalamocortical dysrhythmia), than to widespread cortical de-afferentation."

This is far more probable to arise in this setting with a more locally deafferented thalamus in largely structurally intact brain.

Local increases in blood flow within these same anterior forebrain regions have also been reported in the dominant hemisphere of a stroke patient who recovered fluent speech with zolpidem administration (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cohen et al., 2004</a>)."

Briefly, this mesocircuit model incorporates the basic observation that all severe brain injuries produce diffuse disfacilitation across corticothalamic systems arising from widespread disconnection or neuronal death (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Maxwell et al., 2006</a>). As a consequence of their broad and widespread point to point connections, neurons in the central thalamus are progressively more deafferented with severity of structural brain injuries (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maxwell et al., 2006</a>). Reduction of corticostriatal, thalamocortical and thalamostriatal outflow following multi-focal deafferentation and loss of neurons across the corticothalamic system likely also results in conditions of sufficient loss of afferent input to the medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of striatum to prevent these neurons from reaching firing threshold because of their requirement for high levels of synaptic background activity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grillner et al., 2005</a>). Loss of active inhibition from the striatum in turn is expected to result in release of tonic activity from neurons of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) that will provide an active inhibition to their synaptic targets including relay neurons of the already strongly disfacilitated central thalamus and possibly also the projection neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rye et al., 1996</a>). Collectively, these effects are expected to produce very broad reductions in global cerebral synaptic activity as reflected in very low cerebral metabolic rates typically measured in severe brain injuries producing disorders of consciousness (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib23\">Laureys and Schiff, 2012</a>). The main prediction of this model is that across all etiologies of structural injury, metabolic and functional down-regulation of the anterior forebrain should be prominent. The dominance of the \u223c7.4 Hz activity across fronto-central EEG channels observed here provide support for this prediction."

Zolpidem can also be linked directly to the selective binding of GABA-A alpha 1 receptor subtypes in the neocortex, where it may increase thalamocortical and thalamostriatal outflow indirectly as a result of activation of cortical inhibitory interneuronal networks (<a href=\"#bib27\">McCarthy et al., 2009</a>). In addition, zolpidem may activate the striatum where GABA-A currents facilitate alpha and beta (\u223c8\u201330 Hz) rhythms within the striatum and normal MSN function (<a href=\"#bib28\">McCarthy et al., 2011</a>). Finally, a direct stimulatory action of GABAergic agonist at the pyramidal cell axon could produce excitation and persistent gamma-frequency oscillations (<a href=\"#bib44\">Traub et al., 2003</a>). Collectively, all of these potential mechanisms of zolpidem\u2019s action would result in the marked increase of thalamocortical and thalamostriatal outflow, restoration of corticothalamic and corticostriatal outflow, as well as suppression of tonic inhibition of the central thalamus and possibly the PPN by the GPi."

In the context of anesthesia, broad reductions of background synaptic activity occur during initial sedation. During paradoxical excitation normal subjects demonstrate a brief period of agitation and increased power in the 15\u201330 Hz frequency range after the initial quieting with light sedation. Paradoxical excitation is more common with GABAergic agonists (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brown et al., 2010</a>) and the phenomenon may reflect a similar process of release of thalamocortical outflow. A consistent but less prominent shift of fronto-central activity toward increased beta range frequencies (\u223c15\u201330 Hz) is initiated by zolpidem in the EEG of awake normal subjects receiving the drug but it is not sustained for more than 30 min before returning to baseline (<a href=\"#bib32\">Patat et al., 2004</a>). Thus, it can be expected that all patients administered zolpidem will show similar initial dynamical changes in EEG the early period after drug administration (\u223c30 min). However, in those brain-injured patients who show behavioral facilitation with zolpidem this initial shift of \u2018paradoxical excitation\u2019 is sustained and evolves over time as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and is associated with further dynamical changes (narrowing of increased activity in the 20\u201335 Hz range). The observations of propofol and zolpidem induced increases in 15\u201330 Hz activity shows that an initial shift of power in this range is expected in all subjects, it remains unclear how this initial change interacts with the overall increase in cortical activation (as indexed by the loss of the \u223c7.4 Hz activity) and remains self-sustaining."

This interpretation anticipates other contributions from brain arousal systems and ongoing activity within the cerebrum in maintaining the power distribution in the \u223c20\u201330 Hz range across the frontal-temporal and central-parietal regions as observed for both Subjects studied over hours (refer to <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Such engagement of the plurality of arousal systems in ongoing wakeful behaviors is a powerful arousal stimulus as demonstrated experimentally even in animals with primary deficits in the orexin wake promoting systems of the hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Espa\u00f1a et al., 2008</a>). The evident carry over effects of continued zolpidem use in Subject 2 noted above suggests that restoration of behavior allows additional benefits to be harnessed in drug responders. However, the washout periods here were not varied experimentally, so a more rigorous assessment of this hypothesis awaits future work. The appearance of several posterior EEG channels with increased average center frequency in the 9\u201310 Hz in both subjects 1 and 2 in association with shorter washout intervals (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1 and 2</a>) is also consistent with a time-evolving recruitment of activity; expression of more normal patterns of organized rhythms may require the sustained cortical activation over time, with shorter dosing intervals allowing the effects of each dose to build up background brain activity."

At the time of the study, this subject varied in level of behavioral function from a total score on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) of 10\u201314 at baseline to a reliable score of 23 with zolpidem administration (the highest level of function measured by this instrument, a level consistent with emergence from MCS). At baseline (off zolpidem) the subject could stand and transfer from bed to wheelchair with assistance but made no attempts at verbal communication with or without prompting. He followed simple commands only intermittently and could spontaneously demonstrate the functional use of a napkin but no other commonly used objects (cup, toothbrush, comb). On zolpidem the patient regained fluent spoken language, could accurately give his full name, read and write simple words and phrases as well as demonstrate the functional use of common objects as well demonstrating a variety of higher level executive motor skills (e.g., accurate construction of arbitrary block configuration with up to five different block design objects). On zolpidem the subject responded appropriately to wide range of simple yes/no questions (e.g., \u2018am I pointing to my nose?, do you live in Hawaii?\u2019) and general knowledge questions. Additional testing with Mississippi Aphasia Screening Test during two ON zolpidem periods demonstrated a maximum score of 57/100 items on this examination."

At 2 years after injury the subject had a first exposure to zolpidem and demonstrated recovery of spoken language and accurate communication with first dose. Following this observation the patient began a regime of three zolpidem doses daily around the time of meals as use of the medication allowed for sufficient control of deglutition and management of saliva to safely engage in oral feeding. This regime had continued over the 5 year period prior to these studies. Off zolpidem, the subject exhibited prolonged latency of responses to questions or commands, severe dysarthria and dysphagia. He had left-sided hemiparesis and spasticity with flexor posturing and a 1\u20131.5 Hz resting tremor of the right upper extremity. After receiving zolpidem the subject was alert, attentive and initiated interaction frequently, with improved verbal fluency and articulation, and with shortened latency of response. He organized complex goal-directed movements of both upper extremities (e.g., formulating an accurate \u2018knuckleball\u2019 baseball pitch using the right hand and arm, throwing the ball across the room). He demonstrated reduced spasticity in the left upper extremity, marked reduction of tremor in the right upper extremity and was able to manipulate small objects such as a pen, spoon and a hairbrush with the right hand. Both loss of oral feeding capacity and spasticity of the right extremity returned after each zolpidem dose had worn off."

Prior to zolpidem exposure the patient demonstrated marked arousal impairment and required intensive stimulation to maintain an eyes open awake state. The patient could with vigorous stimulation speak spontaneously emitting only halting expression (stammering, missing words, and frequent phonological and semantic errors). She was confused at baseline and exhibited spatio-temporal disorientation . She also presented visual hallucinations (e.g., \u2018there is a boy running in the room\u2019) and repetitive movements mimicking activities of daily living but out of context (e.g., sewing in the air). The patient was able to demonstrate reproducible responses to verbal command (e.g., squeeze hand) and sustain visual fixation to people in the room but did not demonstrate visual pursuit. Automatic motor behavior such as scratching of nose and passive manipulation of objects occurred spontaneously (e.g., rolling of a ball in the hand). She localized nociceptive stimuli. A yes/no communication system using gesture could be established but without accurate yes/no communication. Following zolpidem administration the patient shifted to an eyes open alert state and showed agitation. Her spontaneous speech rate increased and she formed understandable words in short phrases and initiated interpersonal interactions."

Both studies were performed on a General Electric Discovery LS PET/CT system (General Electric Company, Fairfield, CT) using a standard resting condition in 2-dimensional (2D) mode. Thirty-five slices were acquired in dynamic high-sensitivity emission mode (matrix size = 128 \u00d7 128 \u00d7 35, axial field of view = 25 cm, 4.25-mm slice thickness). Attenuation correction and anatomical localization were achieved by performing a helical CT scan in the same session, the images from which were subsequently reconciled to the PET image."

Global metabolism increased by a factor of 1.97 on zolpidem in comparison to the off-drug state (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). There was an overall increase in anterior forebrain metabolism, with the largest percent increase occurring in the lateral frontal cortex."

This refers to the fact that when behavioral performance is substantially different in two experimental conditions (in this case on and off zolpidem), and some measures of brain physiology are also different between those 2 conditions, this does not in a straightforward way provide causal evidence that the change in physiologic activity is causally responsible for the change in performance. Since effortful mental activity is typically associated with a shift toward more EEG power at higher frequencies, finding a spectral shift of this kind, accompanying behavioral improvement, is not particularly surprising or illuminating. Indeed, it would be quite surprising if the subjects showed significant cognitive improvement without any change in EEG dynamics. The more relevant question is whether the nature of the EEG power spectrum at baseline is predictive of behavioral improvement with the drug. The authors suggest that it is, by noting that high power in the 6\u201310 Hz range was not typical of their previously studied subjects. This is a relatively vague statement, however, since we don't know what proportion of an unselected sample of patients with disorders of consciousness display a particular power level in this frequency range, nor whether those subjects were or were not responsive to zolpidem (though, in an unselected series, one would assume that few if any were zolpidem responsive). The most compelling evidence, then, would be a demonstration that significantly fewer patients who fail to respond to zolpidem have a spectral peak at 6\u201310 Hz and/or that zolpidem does not abolish that peak in non-responders, neither of which is formally reported here."
