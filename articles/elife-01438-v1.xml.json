In mouse sperm, the principal K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>KSper</sub>) is carried by the Slo3 channel, which sets the membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) in a strongly pH<sub>i</sub>-dependent manner. Here, we show that I<sub>KSper</sub> in human sperm is activated weakly by pH<sub>i</sub> and more strongly by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Correspondingly, V<sub>m</sub> is strongly regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and less so by pH<sub>i</sub>. We find that inhibitors of Slo3 suppress human I<sub>KSper</sub>, and we identify the Slo3 protein in the flagellum of human sperm. Moreover, heterologously expressed human Slo3, but not mouse Slo3, is activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> rather than by alkaline pH<sub>i</sub>; current\u2013voltage relations of human Slo3 and human I<sub>KSper</sub> are similar. We conclude that Slo3 represents the principal K<sup>+</sup> channel in human sperm that carries the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated I<sub>KSper</sub> current. We propose that, in human sperm, the progesterone-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx carried by voltage-gated CatSper channels is limited by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-controlled hyperpolarization via Slo3."

In mouse sperm, the principal K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>KSper</sub>) is carried by the Slo3 channel, which sets the membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) in a strongly pH<sub>i</sub>-dependent manner. Here, we show that I<sub>KSper</sub> in human sperm is activated weakly by pH<sub>i</sub> and more strongly by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Correspondingly, V<sub>m</sub> is strongly regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and less so by pH<sub>i</sub>. We find that inhibitors of Slo3 suppress human I<sub>KSper</sub>, and we identify the Slo3 protein in the flagellum of human sperm. Moreover, heterologously expressed human Slo3, but not mouse Slo3, is activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> rather than by alkaline pH<sub>i</sub>; current\u2013voltage relations of human Slo3 and human I<sub>KSper</sub> are similar. We conclude that Slo3 represents the principal K<sup>+</sup> channel in human sperm that carries the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated I<sub>KSper</sub> current. We propose that, in human sperm, the progesterone-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx carried by voltage-gated CatSper channels is limited by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-controlled hyperpolarization via Slo3."

First it must travel along a meandering route to encounter an egg, before pushing through a jelly-like coating that surrounds the egg and then, finally, fusing with the egg\u2019s surface membrane. In order to complete these steps and fertilise the egg, a sperm must undergo a process called \u2018capacitation\u2019. This process, and a variety of other sperm functions, involves the controlled flux of positive ions into and out of the sperm via specific ion channels that are located in the cell membrane."

Also, in mice, this channel is essential for the sperm to function correctly, and for fertilization. However, in humans, it is unclear if the Slo3 channel is present in sperm and if it performs the same role."

However, whereas the mouse Slo3 channel is opened in response to a decrease in the concentration of protons within the sperm (i.e., an increase of the pH inside the cell), human Slo3 is largely controlled by changes in the levels of calcium ions. An increase in the calcium concentration within the cell opens the human Slo3 channel, more than a decrease in the proton concentration does."

We, therefore, examined the pH sensitivity of I<sub>KSper</sub> and V<sub>m</sub> in human sperm. Decreasing pipette pH from 7.3 to 6.2 reduced outward currents by 2.2 \u00b1 1.0-fold (n = 4) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,D,F</a>). Moreover, intracellular alkalization by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl enhanced outward currents by 1.8 \u00b1 0.9-fold (at 100 mV, n = 4) at pipette pH 6.2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>), but not at pipette pH 7.3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B,F</a>). Thus, human I<sub>KSper</sub> is less sensitive to pH<sub>i</sub> than mouse I<sub>KSper</sub>, which is enhanced about fourfold by increasing pH<sub>i</sub> from 6.5 to 7.5 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Navarro et al., 2007</a>). In mouse sperm, I<sub>KSper</sub> sets V<sub>m</sub> in a strongly pH<sub>i</sub>-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib30\">Navarro et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Santi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zeng et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, we tested under current-clamp whether, in human sperm, the control of V<sub>m</sub> by I<sub>KSper</sub> is dependent on pH<sub>i</sub>. At pipette pH 6.2, V<sub>m</sub> was \u221223 \u00b1 5 mV (n = 4) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a> left); raising pipette pH to 7.3 or alkalization by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl hyperpolarized sperm only slightly to \u221230 \u00b1 5 mV and \u221231 \u00b1 4 mV, respectively (n = 4) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B,C</a> left). At pipette pH 7.3, alkalization by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl did not further change V<sub>m</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a> left).

Therefore, we co-expressed mSlo3 with mLRRC52. Raising pH<sub>i</sub> from 7 to 8 strongly enhanced mSlo3 steady-state (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and tail (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) currents, similar to previous results (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schreiber et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhang et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Yang et al., 2011</a>). At pH<sub>i</sub> 8, Ca<sup>2+</sup> (60 or 300 \u00b5M) did not enhance currents (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Instead, outward mSlo3 currents were strongly suppressed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and even tail-current amplitudes were reduced (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). A G-V plot derived from tail currents confirms that Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not activate mSlo3, but inhibits mSlo3 following activation by positive potentials (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

These results exclude the possibility that hLRRC52 confers Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity on hSlo3. Suppression of mSlo3 tail currents by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>) reflects persistent occupancy of the mSlo3 pore by Ca<sup>2+</sup> following repolarization. We note that the voltage-dependent suppression of currents by Ca<sup>2+</sup> is much more pronounced for mSlo3 compared to hSlo3. Ca<sup>2+</sup> occludes the pore of mSlo3 with about 10-fold higher affinity than that of hSlo3 (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>); therefore, inhibition of hSlo3 by Ca<sup>2+</sup> occurs only at very positive, non-physiological V<sub>m</sub>."

Progesterone-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via CatSper has been implicated in sperm chemotaxis, hyperactivation, and acrosomal exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blackmore et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Publicover et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Publicover et al., 2008</a>). We examined whether stimulation of human sperm by progesterone enhances Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels sufficient to activate Slo3 channels. Sperm were loaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators of different Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity as surrogates for high- to low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,C</a>). The progesterone-evoked transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> response was faithfully tracked by high- (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.35 \u00b5M), moderate- (K<sub>D</sub> = 9.7 \u00b5M), and low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (K<sub>D</sub> = 90 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore ionomycin evoked a sustained fluorescence increase reflecting the indicator response to near saturating, millimolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). For indicators with a K<sub>D</sub> value \u2264 2.3 \u00b5M, the amplitudes of progesterone- and ionomycin-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were similar (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>), suggesting that these high-affinity indicators become saturated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the progesterone-evoked response. For indicators with K<sub>D</sub> values \u2265 9.7 \u00b5M, the amplitude ratio of progesterone-evoked/ionomycin-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals decreased with increasing K<sub>D</sub> values. However, even for the low-affinity indicator Fluo-5N, which reports [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes in a concentration range of about 9\u2013900 \u00b5M, the amplitude ratio was as large as 0.25. Thus, considering the dynamic range of indicators (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), our results indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels reached during a physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> response are sufficient to activate Slo3."

(2013)</a> reported that the prototypical Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated member of the Slo channel family, Slo1, is the principal K<sup>+</sup> channel in human sperm. Several observations strongly argue against this conclusion. First, Slo1 is inhibited rather than activated at alkaline pH (<a href=\"#bib1\">Avdonin et al., 2003</a>). Second, specific inhibitors of Slo1 did not inhibit I<sub>KSper</sub>. Third, human Slo1 is largely insensitive to progesterone (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,C</a>). Fourth, we and others (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2013</a>) are unable to identify the Slo1 protein in human sperm. Fifth, if Slo1 carried the current of about 125\u2013150 pA in human sperm (recorded at 100 mV in symmetrical K<sup>+</sup> and saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>), this would correspond to the opening of about 5\u20136 BK channels. Under such conditions, discrete opening and closing transitions of single BK channels would be readily visible; not only at 100 mV, but even more so at voltages &lt; 100 mV. Thus, recordings of I<sub>KSper</sub> current in human sperm are consistent with lower conductance openings characteristic of Slo3, but not Slo1. Finally, the most obvious discrepancy between the two reports concerns the pharmacology. Mannowetz et al. show that K<sup>+</sup> currents in human sperm are abolished by the Slo1 inhibitors IBTX, charybdotoxin (CTX), and paxilline. Although we do not know the reason for this discrepancy, there are differences in experimental conditions. We tested the inhibitors at 1 mM extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] to prevent monovalent CatSper currents and at 1 mM intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] to strongly activate I<sub>KSper</sub>. Mannowetz et al. tested the drugs at 100 \u00b5M extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and in the absence of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Under these conditions, sizeable CatSper currents are recorded (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>), but activation of Slo1 would be minimal."

                        "text": "What might be the function of Slo3 in sperm? It has been suggested that the I<sub>KSper</sub>-mediated hyperpolarization reinforces Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via CatSper by increasing the electrical driving force (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clapham, 2013</a>). Alternatively, we propose that the hyperpolarization serves as a negative feedback that decreases the open probability of CatSper and, thereby, curtails rather than enhances Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Why did Slo3 switch in human sperm from a strictly pH-sensitive to a pH- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel? In mouse, Slo3 and CatSper are both voltage- and strongly alkaline-activated. In human but not in mouse sperm, CatSper is directly activated by progesterone and prostaglandins (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lishko et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Str\u00fcnker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brenker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). Thus, human CatSper mediates a ligand- rather than an alkaline-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Moreover, the pH sensitivity of both Slo3 and CatSper is considerably lower in human compared to mouse sperm, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of Slo3 may have evolved in concert with ligand activation of CatSper. This co-evolution might ensure that ligand-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via CatSper is coupled to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-controlled hyperpolarization via Slo3. Thus, by curtailing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via CatSper, I<sub>Ksper</sub> may serve a similar role in both mouse and human sperm despite its differential regulation by intracellular ligands. The control of V<sub>m</sub> by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and pH<sub>i</sub> and the interplay of CatSper and Slo3 deserve further study in intact, freely moving human sperm with non-invasive and kinetic techniques, for example using voltage-sensitive dyes."

CatSper and Slo3 are both located in the principal piece. Moreover, progesterone-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals originate in the flagellum and propagate in a tail-to-head direction (<a href=\"#bib43\">Servin-Vences et al., 2012</a>). Due to the miniscule flagellar volume (about 2.5 fl), opening a few CatSper channels, each conducting several thousand Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions per second, would increase local flagellar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] to levels that should readily exceed global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. The potential interplay of Slo3 and CatSper in sperm is reminiscent of the interplay in neurons between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<sub>v</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Prakriya and Lingle, 2000</a>). In neurons, Slo1 and Ca<sub>v</sub> channels interact to form local microdomains of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling near the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berkefeld et al., 2006</a>). In microdomains, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] can rise to levels \u227f 100 \u00b5M that are readily sensed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rizzuto and Pozzan, 2006</a>).

Slo channels and a large number of bacterial channels/transporters harbor a homologous octameric intracellular domain, dubbed the gating ring, that provides a template for ligand regulation of the pore domain (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lingle, 2007</a>). The gating-ring motif has evolved for regulation of transmembrane ion flux by nucleotides, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>, and probably other cytosolic ligands (<a href=\"#bib37\">Salkoff et al., 2006</a>).

However, the conformational changes that couple binding to gating remain incompletely defined and the location of ligand-binding sites varies markedly (<a href=\"#bib37\">Salkoff et al., 2006</a>). Our study adds an interesting twist, demonstrating that, even among Slo3 orthologues, the gating-ring motif has been exploited for regulation by different ligands \u2014 primarily Ca<sup>2+</sup> in hSlo3 and primarily H<sup>+</sup> in mSlo3. Alignment of human Slo1 sequence with human Slo3 and other mammalian Slo3 sequences illustrates that, although the membrane-associated S0-S6 domain retains considerable identity (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), there is extensive lack of identity in many segments of the ligand-sensing cytosolic domain (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Given that positions of ligand-sensing determinants in regulator of K<sup>+</sup> conductance (RCK)-containing proteins vary markedly within the RCK domain structures, it is not surprising that simple examination of the Slo3 sequence alignments does not reveal obvious determinants of either pH sensitivity in mSlo3 or Ca<sup>2+\u2212</sup>sensitivity in hSlo3."

Membranes were sedimented by centrifugation (100,000\u00d7<i>g</i>, 30 min, 4\u00b0C) and membrane proteins were processed by in-gel digestion, in-solution digestion, or a FASP protocol. Peptides were subjected to 1D-ESI-LC-MS/MS using a nanoAcquity UltraPerformance LC System (Waters, Milford, Massachusetts, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Velos or Elite instrument (Thermo, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The resulting tandem MS data were searched using the Sequest algorithms embedded in Proteome Discoverer 1.2 (Thermo) against a SwissProt/UniProtKB human protein sequence database (including 56,582 entries). The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set to \u226410 ppm; the mass tolerance for fragment ions was set to \u2264 1 amu. For search result filtering, the false discovery rate (FDR) was set to &lt; 1% and only peptides with search result rank 1 were accepted for identification. For targeted mass spectrometry, the instrument control software used a list of theoretical tryptic peptide masses for the proteins of interest for subsequent CID fragmentation, that is once a mass from the list was detected in the orbitrap full scan, it was preferred over all other co-eluting masses, independent of its signal intensity."

Based on analysis of the NCBI <i>slo3</i> gene (<i>kcnu1</i>, NM_001031836), 62 base pairs (bp) present around the S10 region in BC028701 correspond to an intron left over from incomplete mRNA splicing. The intron sequences were removed by site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, there are at least three polymorphic sites present in the EST clone corresponding to amino-acid positions 192, 739, and 768 of hSlo3. The three sites were changed to match those of the human genomic sequence (NCBI reference sequence: NC_000008.10; Chromosome 8). This results in 192W, 739R, and 768W. The full length coding sequence of hSlo3 was subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pXMX (see details in <a href=\"#bib48\">Tang et al., 2010</a>). The hSlo3 sequence used here is identical to that used in another study (<a href=\"#bib20\">Leonetti et al., 2012</a>). An hLRRC52 (NM_001005214.3) clone was generated from two HEK genomic DNA fragments of 622 bp and 320 bp which correspond to hLRRC52 exons 1 and 2, respectively. The two fragments were amplified via over-lapping PCR and subcloned into the pXMX vector. For the mCherry-tagged hLRRC52, seven glycines were added as a spacer between the carboxy-terminus of hLRRC52 and the amino-terminus of mCherry; the hLRRC52-mCherry construct was also subcloned into pXMX vector. All cDNA clones were verified by sequencing. For expression in oocytes, cRNA was synthesized by SP6 polymerase after the cDNA template was linearized with the restriction enzyme MluI."

Functional hallmarks of hSlo3 as seen in sperm can be recapitulated in CHO cells expressing recombinant hSlo3 and the auxiliary subunit LRRC52.

The authors confirm these observation by others by direct electrophysiological recordings in human sperm.

The 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> pipette had 1 mM EGTA with no added Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which results a free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] of perhaps &lt; 10 nM. The pipette solution contains no ATP or GTP. Such condition may be fine for studying the biophysical properties of a channel with voltage-clamping, but is too \u201cunphysiological\u201d for studying the regulation of membrane potential. It is hard to interpret the apparent lack of large effect on V<sub>m</sub> by pH<sub>i</sub> change under this condition. The authors also cited the paper by Navarro (PNAS 104:7688-7692) to compare the difference between human and mouse sperm in the effects of pH<sub>i</sub> on V<sub>m</sub>. However, there is large difference between the pipette solutions used in the two studies (Navarro et al. included ATP and GTP in the pipette and had apparently different free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration). The authors should at least test several Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations close to the physiological levels. In addition, all the pipette solutions have 50 mM HEPES. It's not clear whether 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl in the bath is able to significantly increase pH<sub>i</sub> when 50 mM HEPES is included in the pipette, and this is critical to the conclusion that pH<sub>i</sub> increase doesn't have much effect on V<sub>m</sub>. Finally, the numbers of cells (n = 3, 4) are too small to draw statistically significant conclusions, especially when measuring V<sub>m</sub> of primary cells."

If that were the case, we would certainly agree that the manuscript contributes little new information. However, the focus of the manuscript is in establishing that the human sperm K<sup>+</sup> current is, in fact, regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with weaker regulation by pH. The prototypical Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated and pH-activated members of this channel family are Slo1 and Slo3, respectively. Thus, the important question is whether the human sperm K<sup>+</sup> current is carried by Slo1 or Slo3. Our results demonstrate that human I<sub>KSper</sub> current arises from Slo3 and not Slo1. Furthermore, we show that heterologously expressed human Slo3 is Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulated. These observations are entirely new and it is surprising that two orthologous proteins, mSlo3 and hSlo3, have such different regulation by cytosolic ligands."
