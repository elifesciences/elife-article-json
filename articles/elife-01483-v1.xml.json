In contrast, cotransin likely binds at the other end of the channel, to a piece of Sec61 that serves to plug the exit into the endoplasmic reticulum; and this plug is directly connected to the side-gate. By preventing the plug from moving out of the way, cotransin can somehow stop the new protein from passing through the side-gate. However, MacKinnon, Paavilainen et al. did find that some membrane proteins with certain physical and chemical properties could get through the gate, despite the presence of cotransin. The next challenge is to resolve exactly how interactions between cotransin and the Sec61 plug can block the escape of new proteins into the membrane."

This process begins when the first hydrophobic segment of a nascent membrane protein, often a transmembrane domain (TMD), emerges from a translating ribosome and is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP). The SRP system (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akopian et al., 2013</a>) targets the ribosome-nascent polypeptide complex (RNC) to the ER membrane and transfers it to a translocation channel, or translocon, the central component of which is the Sec61 complex (<a href=\"#bib37\">Osborne et al., 2005</a>). Sec61 binds the ribosome near the polypeptide exit tunnel and mediates both cotranslational translocation and TMD integration. This means that the Sec61 channel opens not only toward the ER lumen, but also laterally toward the lipid bilayer. While lateral TMD release through the Sec61 channel was appreciated long ago (<a href=\"#bib33\">Martoglio et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Do et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mothes et al., 1997</a>), the precise mechanism of this crucial step in membrane protein biogenesis remains unclear."

Several models have been proposed to explain how this occurs. In one model, the TMD is thought to equilibrate between the aqueous Sec61 channel and the lipid bilayer (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heinrich et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hessa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ojemalm et al., 2011</a>). This process would be facilitated by an intrinsically dynamic lateral gate in Sec61 that allows the polypeptide segment inside the channel to reversibly sample the membrane. A second model proposes that TMD integration is facilitated by direct interactions with Sec61. This idea is supported by the analysis of stalled RNCs of membrane proteins at different lengths. Not only does the TMD of such stalled RNCs crosslink to Sec61, but it also appears to be oriented in a specific manner, as judged by asymmetric crosslinks to adjacent TMD residues (<a href=\"#bib34\">McCormick et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sadlish et al., 2005</a>). Molecular dynamics simulations further suggest that lateral gating is facilitated by the TMD and that TMD movement into the lipid bilayer is a kinetically irreversible event (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhang and Miller, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">2012</a>). Analysis of cotranslational integration in yeast has also revealed a kinetic barrier to TMD insertion (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cheng and Gilmore, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Trueman et al., 2011</a>)."

The crystal structure of the archaeal complex revealed that SecY (homologous to eukaryotic Sec61\u03b1) comprises a compact bundle of 10 transmembrane helices (TM1\u201310) arranged in a pseudo-twofold symmetric structure, with TM1\u20135 and 6\u201310 forming two halves of a \u2018clamshell\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Van den Berg et al., 2004</a>). The interior of the clamshell forms an hourglass-shaped pore in the membrane, the center of which is occluded by a short \u03b1-helix termed the plug. The front of the clamshell, at the interface between TM2/3 and TM7/8, forms a lateral gate that, when opened, could provide direct access to the lipid bilayer from the central pore."

When coupled with ongoing translation, this event would position the nascent polypeptide within the channel and provide access of the hydrophobic TMD to the lipid bilayer. This idea is supported by the observation that signal peptides can be crosslinked to Sec61\u03b1 TM2 and TM7 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Plath et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2004</a>) and that mutations in the lateral gate can influence TMD integration (<a href=\"#bib27\">Junne et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Trueman et al., 2012</a>).

We reasoned that because Sec61 represents the final destination of a nascent TMD prior to its integration into the membrane, small-molecule modulators like cotransin could shed light on this poorly understood process. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism by which cotransin inhibits membrane protein insertion. We demonstrate that cotransin stabilizes an ephemeral pre-integrated intermediate in which the TMD docks against the cytosolic tip of the Sec61 lateral gate. Progression through this cotransin-arrested stage was found to depend on TMD hydrophobicity, helical propensity, and charge distribution, features that contribute to cotransin\u2019s ability to discriminate among different substrates. Using genetic selection in human cancer cells, we identified multiple point mutations in the lumenal plug region of Sec61\u03b1 that confer dominant resistance and prevent cotransin binding. These results support a model in which cotransin binding to the plug prevents lateral gating by susceptible TMDs, whereas TMDs with increased hydrophobicity and helical propensity can override the cotransin-imposed block. More generally, our characterization of a pre-integrated complex implies that dynamic interactions between the TMD and Sec61 can facilitate lateral gating and membrane integration."

Direct detection of cotransin binding to Sec61 was aided by CT7, an isosteric and equipotent analog of CT8 equipped with a diazirine for covalent photo-crosslinking to Sec61\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">MacKinnon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). FLAG-tagged TNF\u03b1 nascent chains of 126 residues (126-mers) were assembled on ER microsomes in the presence or absence of CT7, solubilized with digitonin, immunopurified with anti-FLAG beads, and analyzed for the presence of Sec61\u03b1 and CT7. Sec61\u03b1 specifically copurified with FLAG-TNF\u03b1 RNCs, as it was not detected on anti-FLAG beads recovered from control reactions programed with HA-tagged TNF\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Moreover, the amount of Sec61\u03b1 copurifying with TNF\u03b1 RNCs was identical in the absence or presence of CT7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lane 1 vs 2), suggesting that CT7 does not weaken the affinity of the RNC-Sec61 complex. Finally, the amount of CT7 covalently bound to Sec61\u03b1 in the FLAG-TNF\u03b1 immunoprecipitates was identical whether the photo-crosslinking step was carried out before or after the stringent immunopurification and washing steps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lane 2 vs 3). Thus, CT7, Sec61, and TNF\u03b1 RNCs assemble into a high-affinity ternary complex amenable to biochemical analysis."

At the 126-mer length, TNF\u03b1 RNCs should have sufficient polypeptide beyond the TMD (\u223c75 amino acids) to have stably inserted into the Sec61 channel in the \u2018looped\u2019 orientation, with the TMD at least partially exposed to the lipid bilayer (<a href=\"#bib33\">Martoglio et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">McCormick et al., 2003</a>). Consistent with this expectation, 126-mer RNCs assembled in the absence of CT8 were predominantly shielded from protease, generating a large protected fragment that consists of the TMD plus the lumenal C-terminal domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This fragment was not observed in the absence of microsomes, suggesting that the TNF\u03b1 TMD and ectodomain are protected by the Sec61 complex and the membrane. RNCs produced in the presence of CT8 generated sharply reduced amounts of the protected fragment, indicating that the nascent chain remained primarily in a protease-accessible compartment, despite binding tightly to the Sec61 complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

We monitored accessibility of Cys49 to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which efficiently reacts with cysteine thiols exposed to an aqueous environment. In this assay, ER-targeted RNCs are first alkylated with NEM under native conditions, followed by quenching, denaturation with SDS, and modification of unreacted sulfhydryls with PEG-maleimide. Thus, PEG-modified nascent chains (identified by a molecular weight shift) represent RNCs whose Cys49 sulfhydryl was initially inaccessible to NEM. When 126-mers were assembled without CT8, Cys49 was unreactive toward NEM, whereas the same nascent chains assembled in the presence of CT8 were strongly reactive and thus protected from subsequent reaction with PEG-maleimide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These results are consistent with the protease protection assay and demonstrate that CT8 causes 126-mers to occupy a distinct environment, one in which Cys49 in the TMD is exposed to aqueous solvent."

This transition occurred over a narrow range of nascent chain lengths, between 116- and 126-mers. By contrast, in the presence of CT8, the TMD remained accessible to NEM at every nascent chain length tested (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Given that efficient alkylation with NEM requires an aqueous environment, the abrupt transition observed in the absence of CT8 likely represents TMD integration into the lipid bilayer. Not only is the polypeptide sufficiently long at this stage to exit the translocon, but this is also the length at which earlier studies have observed photo-crosslinking of the TMD to phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib33\">Martoglio et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mothes et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Urbanus et al., 2001</a>). While the TMD may remain close to Sec61 at this stage (<a href=\"#bib34\">McCormick et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sadlish et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Devaraneni et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Frauenfeld et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hou et al., 2012</a>), it has most likely exited the central aqueous pore of Sec61.

BMH crosslinking of wild-type TNF\u03b1 126-mers (native cysteines at positions 30 and 49 in the TMD) yielded no major crosslinked products (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), consistent with the solvent inaccessibility of the TMD at this length.

These crosslinks were diminished when a termination codon was introduced at position 126, indicating that only tRNA-bound nascent chains crosslink to the Sec61 complex.

Given the \u223c15 amino acid tether between the C-terminal end of the TMD and the polypeptide exit tunnel (positions 51\u201365 of the 96-mer), Cys49 is likely situated within or near the cytosolic vestibule of Sec61\u03b1 such that it can reach a solvent-exposed cysteine on Sec61\u03b1 (via the 13 \u00c5 crosslinker). As the nascent chain was extended beyond 96 residues, crosslinking to Sec61\u03b1 decreased abruptly and was undetectable by 126 amino acids. This transition parallels the loss in NEM accessibility (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) and further suggests that the TMD exits the Sec61\u03b1 vestibule at this stage of nascent chain elongation. Integration of the TMD is therefore preceded by a step in which Cys49 of the TMD passes within \u223c13 \u00c5 of an accessible cysteine in Sec61\u03b1."

Although short nascent chains (up to 86-mers) had a similar crosslinking profile, all RNCs beyond this length were clearly distinct from the matched samples lacking CT8. Not only were the crosslinks to Sec61\u03b1 and Sec61\u03b2 more intense, but they also persisted beyond the point where TMD integration occurred in the absence of CT8 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Order-of-addition experiments indicated that TMD egress from the cytosolic vestibule (operationally defined by the disappearance of TMD/Sec61\u03b1 crosslinks) becomes irreversible once the nascent chain has progressed from 106- to 126-mers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). When 106-mers were first assembled in the absence of CT8, isolated by sedimentation, and then incubated with CT8 post-translationally, enhanced TMD/Sec61\u03b1 crosslinks were observed. By contrast, post-translational addition of CT8 to identically prepared 126-mers had no effect, indicating that the 126-mers had crossed a kinetic point-of-no-return that could not be reversed by CT8. Taken together, these data argue: (1) CT8 stabilizes a configuration of the TMD/Sec61 complex that occurs just prior to a committed step of TMD integration, and (2) a similar pre-integrated configuration occurs in the absence of CT8 for nascent chain lengths of 96\u2013106 amino acids. That CT8 actually enhances the initial interaction between Sec61\u03b1 and the TMD (as determined by BMH crosslinking) suggests an allosteric mechanism of action."

We used BMH crosslinking to probe the environment of a cysteine residue scanned across the TMD and flanking regions of 126-mers assembled in the presence or absence of CT8 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). As expected on the basis of protease and NEM accessibility experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>), 126-mers assembled in the absence of CT8 displayed no protein crosslinks to cysteines within the TMD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). By contrast, 126-mers prepared with CT8 showed strong crosslinks to Sec61\u03b1, with peak intensities at positions 35, 38, 42, 45, and 49 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). A helix-destabilizing proline mutation in the center of the TMD (V41P) abolished the periodic crosslinking pattern without significantly affecting RNC targeting to Sec61 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). An identical periodic crosslinking pattern was observed with both shorter (96-mers) and longer (146-mers) nascent chains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). The sharp periodicity of the crosslinks (<i>i</i>, <i>i</i>+3, <i>i</i>+7, etc), along with the consistent pattern observed across multiple nascent chain lengths, indicates that the TMD helix is not oriented randomly relative to Sec61\u03b1. Instead, the TMD appears to have a defined orientation, docked to Sec61\u03b1 in a manner that is presumably stabilized by CT8. In the absence of CT8, a periodic crosslinking pattern across the TMD was not observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), despite the strong crosslinks to Cys49 in the context of 96-mers (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

We note that the N-terminal tail of CT8-arrested, pre-integrated TNF\u03b1 is highly accessible to the cytosolic side of the membrane, consistent with the early establishment of a type II orientation. It is therefore unlikely that TNF\u03b1 initially exposes its N-terminus to the ER lumen, as shown in a recent study of a different type II membrane protein (<a href=\"#bib6\">Devaraneni et al., 2011</a>).

By contrast, the CT8-arrested state is distinguished by a TMD helix that has not integrated, but is instead accessible to the aqueous environment and docked to Sec61\u03b1 in a specific orientation. This pre-integrated configuration is stabilized by CT8 from the 96-mer until at least the 146-mer. The degree to which the cotransin-stabilized Sec61 conformation resembles integration intermediates that form in the absence of cotransin is not clear. Cotransin may stabilize one of a continuum of conformational states adopted by Sec61 during the normal process of cotranslational integration (e.g., TMD docked to a lateral gate that is partially open toward the cytosol, but closed near the lumenal plug)."

This is because the \u03b2 subunit is poorly conserved across species and does not contribute substantially to the structural core of the Sec61 complex.

However, a mechanistic explanation for these effects has remained elusive. Given the intimate association between the TMD and the cytosolic face of TM2b and TM8, we reasoned that certain TMD mutants should be able to overcome the CT8-imposed barrier to integration via productive interactions with the lateral gate helices and/or membrane lipids. Comparison of sensitive and resistant TMDs at multiple points along the integration pathway (i.e., at multiple nascent chain lengths) should allow us to: (1) test whether they pass through a common intermediate and (2) define the point at which their fates diverge.

BMH crosslinking of successively longer T45L/T46L RNCs assembled without CT8 showed a pattern that was similar to wild-type TNF\u03b1: crosslinks to Sec61\u03b1 were observed over a narrow length range, 86- to 96-mers, beyond which the crosslinks abruptly disappeared (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

At longer chain lengths, crosslinking of the mutant TMD to Sec61\u03b1 was not observed, consistent with its successful integration into the membrane beyond the 96-mer stage (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>).

One potential explanation is the increased overall hydrophobicity of the T45L/T46L mutant, which is predicted to have a greater thermodynamic driving force for membrane integration (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hessa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ojemalm et al., 2011</a>). While mutating multiple polar residues to leucine resulted in increased CT8 resistance (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), further mutational analysis revealed that overall hydrophobicity is not the sole determinant. Hydrophobic to lysine mutations in the N-terminal region of the TMD, for example, led to increased CT8 resistance, whereas such mutations in the central or C-terminal regions had the opposite effect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This may be mechanistically related to the observation that positively charged flanking residues influence TMD orientation (\u2018positive-inside rule\u2019) and facilitate membrane integration (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hessa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lerch-Bader et al., 2008</a>), potentially due to interactions with negative charges on or near the cytoplasmic face of Sec61 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Goder et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Frauenfeld et al., 2011</a>). Proline-scanning mutagenesis across the TMD resulted in similar position-dependent effects, conferring increased CT8 resistance when introduced into the N-terminal region and increased sensitivity in the central region (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

With few exceptions, dominant resistance mutations that reduce a drug\u2019s binding affinity localize to the drug\u2019s binding site or its immediate vicinity; confidence in this interpretation is especially high when multiple resistance mutations localize to the same site (<a href=\"#bib4\">Campbell et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shah et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wacker et al., 2012</a>), although remote allosteric effects on drug binding are also possible."

To determine whether these mutants support TNF\u03b1 integration in the presence of CT8, we generated stable cell lines that express wild-type or mutant Sec61\u03b1 constructs from a tetracycline-inducible promoter. For these experiments, we used HEK293 cells, whose viability is unaffected by CT8 treatment for at least 72 hr. Upon induction with tetracycline, both wild-type and mutant Sec61\u03b1 transgenes (untagged) were expressed at similar levels as the endogenous protein (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Whereas CT8 potently inhibited TNF\u03b1 expression in cells with the wild-type Sec61\u03b1 transgene (IC<sub>50</sub> \u223c 50 nM), it had little effect in cells carrying either the M136T or R66I mutant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). These results indicate that the Sec61\u03b1 mutants assemble into functional translocons and that the M136T and R66I mutations are sufficient to confer dominant resistance to CT8. Because we could not easily distinguish endogenous Sec61\u03b1 from the mutants expressed in HEK293 cells, we measured cotransin binding to recombinant Sec61\u03b1/\u03b3 overexpressed in Sf21 insect cells, as described in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. CT7 photo-crosslinking assays revealed specific binding to wild-type Sec61\u03b1, but greatly reduced and undetectable binding to the M136T and R66I mutants, respectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Although the mutations may have subtle effects on Sec61 function, the CT7 photo-crosslinking data argue that reduced cotransin binding causes resistance in the cell proliferation and TNF\u03b1 expression assays."

However, the mechanism and timing of TMD egress, along with the role of the TMD itself in the integration process, have remained unclear. In this study, we have exploited a small-molecule inhibitor of cotranslational integration (cotransin, CT8) to trap and interrogate a nascent TMD prior to its exit from the cytosolic vestibule. By analyzing recombinant cysteine mutants of Sec61\u03b1, we identified a TMD docking site near the cytosolic tip of the lateral gate. This intimate association suggests that the TMD helix may facilitate opening of the lateral gate. Indeed, such a gating transition may underlie the recently described \u2018pulling force\u2019 exerted by the translocon on a nascent TMD just before its integration into the membrane (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ismail et al., 2012</a>)."

In this model, RNC targeting to Sec61 allows partial opening of the lateral gate toward the cytosol, as observed in a crystal structure of SecYE bound to a Fab fragment (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tsukazaki et al., 2008</a>). In the SecYE/Fab structure, separation of TM2b from the cytosolic end of TM8 creates a notch in the lateral gate, which we propose to be the initial docking site for a nascent TMD after its release from SRP (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, middle). At the 96-mer stage, docking of the TMD to this site enables BMH crosslinking to Sec61\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). As the nascent chain elongates, interhelical contacts that seal the lateral gate are progressively destabilized. This key transition, which is opposed by CT8 binding (most likely to the plug), leads to complete intercalation of the TMD between helices TM2/3 and TM7/8 of the lateral gate, concomitant with exposure of the TMD to membrane lipids (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, right). As indicated by the pronounced rightward shifts in the CT8 dose-response curves (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), TMDs with greater hydrophobicity and helical propensity are better able to progress to this state, presumably in kinetic competition with CT8."

This conclusion is further strengthened by the observation that R66I and M136T mutations abrogate CT7 binding (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), although we cannot exclude the possibility that mutations in the plug perturb cotransin binding to a remote site. Given that binding to the lumenal plug arrests the TMD in its cytosolic docking site &gt;20 \u00c5 away, cotransins appear to exhibit characteristics of both allosteric and competitive inhibitors. We note that the closed conformation of the channel (<a href=\"#bib47\">Van den Berg et al., 2004</a>) cannot accommodate a molecule the size of CT8, whereas a cavity, outlined by the identified mutations and roughly large enough for CT8, is apparent in structures with a partially open lateral gate (<a href=\"#bib9\">Egea and Stroud, 2010</a>). We speculate that CT8 binding stabilizes interactions between the plug, TM3, and TM7, thereby sealing the lateral gate at its lumenal end in a manner similar to that proposed for the Q129L and N302L mutations in yeast Sec61p (<a href=\"#bib44\">Trueman et al., 2012</a>). In this view, CT8 acts as a molecular wedge that impedes TMD integration by blocking displacement of the plug. Alternatively, CT8 binding may itself result in the displacement or structural rearrangement of the plug; here again, CT8 would act as a molecular wedge that prevents TMD movement through the lumenal end of the lateral gate. This model is suggested by a recent electron crystallographic structure of the SecYEG complex in which a signal peptide bound to the lipid-exposed face of the lateral gate displaces the plug 10 \u00c5 relative to apo-SecYEG (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hizlan et al., 2012</a>). Further structural studies are needed to provide an atomic-resolution view of how cotransins engage Sec61 to arrest TMD integration."

The authors present convincing evidence that cotransin stabilizes an early targeting intermediate. Elegant crosslinkng experiments localized the TM binding site to the cytosolic vestibule of Sec61. Point mutations in the TNF TM span reduce or enhance sensitivity to cotransin, depending upon whether the mutation increases hydrophobicity or alter the predicted helical propensity of the TM span. Cotransin insensitive mammalian cells were isolated, and found to have point mutations in the Sec61 plug domain. The most important feature of this manuscript is that it provides evidence for an initial binding site for signal sequences prior to insertion into the lateral gate."

The fragment might correspond to a ribosome-shielded peptide. Also, the fragment does not disappear completely after detergent solubilisation, which remains unexplained. The authors should demonstrate that the protected fragment contains the TM span, and also is a peptidyl-tRNA and whether Cys-46 or some of the other cysteine is part of the PK inaccessible fragment using the corresponding mutant TNF\u03b1."

However, this should be taken with caution since the experiments make use of a CT8-blocked translocon that is no longer responsive to the incoming nascent chain. It is unclear if the arrested state is truly a transient intermediate or the direct result of a block at Sec61, yielding an arrested non-physiological state where the translocon is unable to open because of its interactions with CT8. The authors argue that inhibition is allosteric, of which I am in complete agreement; however, this would suggest that the Sec61\u03b1/cotransin complex is in a distinct conformation relative to the channel alone. This would further suggest that the nature of the TMD interaction in the presence of cotransin does not necessarily reflect an on-pathway intermediate. In fact, the data might support a unique interaction as <a href=\"#fig1 fig2\">Figures 1C and 2B</a> suggest that the nature of the interaction is distinct as CT8 enhances the pre-integration interaction (the authors note this at the end of the paragraph \u2018CT8 stabilizes a transient pre-integrated intermediate\u2019). This distinction is not critical to the story; however, it does qualify the ability to describe the cotransin complex as a 'pre-integrated intermediate'. In fact, the authors argue that a true pre-integrated TMD complex likely samples multiple conformations. So, at best, they are stabilizing one possible intermediate. In my opinion, they may be stabilizing a unique state that only appears in the presence of cotransin. A remedy might just be to provide some clarity to the 'intermediate' discussion early on."

The Results section states that the crosslinking pattern of V41P 126mers is different even though RNC targeting is not significantly affected. The crosslinking pattern is clearly different, but I am not sure how the authors reach the conclusion that RNC of V41P targeting was normal. The Sec61\u03b1 crosslinks are similar in intensity (\u00b1CT8). Crosslinks seem to be elevated for -CT8 and reduced for +CT8. Sec61\u03b2 crosslinks are mainly in the +CT8 lanes. In a later figure, data is presented that V41P 126mers progress to the integrated form based upon protease digestion, so it is not clear why any crosslinking is observed in the -CT8 case. Overall, I wonder whether the V41P mutation reduces integration at multiple points in the absence of CT8, and as such, whether analysis of this sample adds definitive information to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>."

The authors conclude that the mutant residues define the binding site for cotransin. While this interpretation is possible, an alternative interpretation is that point mutations in the plug domain indirectly perturb the cotransin binding site. The basis for this alternative interpretation is that there are a number of previously identified point mutations in the plug domain that are thought to destabilize the plug domain and allow more permissive translocation of precursors (the prl mutants). The most effective mutations identified in the current study (R66G and R66I) are probably prl alleles. R66 in human Sec61 corresponds to R67 in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Sec61 and N65 in <i>E. coli</i> SecY. Martin Spiess isolated the R67E and R67C alleles, both of which have the prl phenotype. The <i>E. coli</i> N65Y mutant corresponds to prlA8914, which was isolated by the Beckwith lab. Rather it could be that these mutations effect a conformational change in Sec61-\u03b1 that also reduces the effectiveness of CT9. In this respect, the probed sites cluster in a region that when mutated in the bacterial SecY causes prl mutations. While the Discussion tempers this, the description of the mutations in the results gives a strong impression that there is only one interpretation.

PEG-Mal treatment resulted in a gel shift of the PK-protected nascent chain containing Cys49 in the TMD; no shift was observed with a Cys-free construct. The TNF\u03b1 peptidyl- tRNA species was also labeled by PEG-Mal, which shows that the PK-protected band includes the C-terminus of the TNF\u03b1 126-mer (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1D</a>)."

However, this should be taken with caution since the experiments make use of a CT8-blocked translocon that is no longer responsive to the incoming nascent chain. It is unclear if the arrested state is truly a transient intermediate or the direct result of a block at Sec61, yielding an arrested non-physiological state where the translocon is unable to open because of its interactions with CT8. The authors argue that inhibition is allosteric, of which I am in complete agreement; however, this would suggest that the Sec61\u03b1/cotransin complex is in a distinct conformation relative to the channel alone. This would further suggest that the nature of the TMD interaction in the presence of cotransin does not necessarily reflect an on-pathway intermediate. In fact, the data might support a unique interaction as</i> <a href=\"#fig1 fig2\">\n<i>Figures 1C and 2B</i>\n</a> <i>suggest that the nature of the interaction is distinct as CT8 enhances the pre-integration interaction (the authors note this at the end of the paragraph \u2018CT8 stabilizes a transient pre-integrated intermediate\u2019). This distinction is not critical to the story; however, it does qualify the ability to describe the cotransin complex as a 'pre-integrated intermediate'. In fact, the authors argue that a true pre-integrated TMD complex likely samples multiple conformations. So, at best, they are stabilizing one possible intermediate. In my opinion, they may be stabilizing a unique state that only appears in the presence of cotransin. A remedy might just be to provide some clarity to the 'intermediate' discussion early on</i>."

Nevertheless, our data clearly show: (1) in the absence of cotransin, the nascent TMD transiently occupies a configuration in which it crosslinks to Sec61\u03b1, (2) this state occurs prior to TMD integration, (3) this state (as defined by TMD crosslinking to Sec61\u03b1) is stabilized by cotransin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), and (4) a \u2018cotransin-resistant\u2019 TMD mutant is transiently arrested in this state (by cotransin) prior to its escape and successful integration at longer nascent chain lengths (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). While it is possible that the cotransin-arrested Sec61 conformation is 'non-physiological', we feel it is more likely that cotransin binding stabilizes one of many conformational states normally accessed during TMD integration and prevents the transition of Sec61 to a fully open conformation.

The Results section states that the crosslinking pattern of V41P 126mers is different even though RNC targeting is not significantly affected. The crosslinking pattern is clearly different, but I am not sure how the authors reach the conclusion that RNC of V41P targeting was normal. The Sec61\u03b1 crosslinks are similar in intensity (\u00b1CT8). Crosslinks seem to be elevated for -CT8 and reduced for +CT8. Sec61\u03b2 crosslinks are mainly in the +CT8 lanes. In a later figure, data is presented that V41P 126mers progress to the integrated form based upon protease digestion, so it is not clear why any crosslinking is observed in the -CT8 case.

By contrast, cotransin- induced crosslinking to Sec61\u03b1 is much weaker with V41P than with WT 126-mers. Moreover, the helical periodicity observed with WT TNF\u03b1 is not apparent with V41P. These observations support our contention that WT and T45L/T46L, but not V41P, adopt a helical conformation with a defined orientation in the cotransin-arrested state. Adopting this conformation and orientation is not prerequisite for successful integration or cotransin sensitivity."

The authors conclude that the mutant residues define the binding site for cotransin. While this interpretation is possible, an alternative interpretation is that point mutations in the plug domain indirectly perturb the cotransin binding site. The basis for this alternative interpretation is that there are a number of previously identified point mutations in the plug domain that are thought to destabilize the plug domain and allow more permissive translocation of precursors (the prl mutants). The most effective mutations identified in the current study (R66G and R66I) are probably prl alleles. R66 in human Sec61 corresponds to R67 in</i> S. cerevisiae <i>Sec61 and N65 in</i> E. coli <i>SecY. Martin Spiess isolated the R67E and R67C alleles, both of which have the prl phenotype.

Rather it could be that these mutations effect a conformational change in Sec61-\u03b1 that also reduces the effectiveness of CT9. In this respect, the probed sites cluster in a region that when mutated in the bacterial SecY causes prl mutations. While the Discussion tempers this, the description of the mutations in the results gives a strong impression that there is only one interpretation. It might be useful to include some other possible explanations.

Most importantly, we showed that select mutations (R66I and M136T) not only confer cotransin resistance in functional assays, but they also prevent CT7 binding. In our view, these combined observations indicate a high likelihood that the mutations are proximal to the cotransin binding site. We are unaware of examples where multiple drug resistance mutations cluster to the same site of the target and prevent drug binding, yet are located far away from the drug binding site.
