However, direct evidence for such a system, and the physiological basis of its computations, is lacking. Using an auditory stimulus whose pitch value changed according to specific rules, we controlled and separated the three key computational variables underlying perception, and discovered, using direct recordings from human auditory cortex, that <i>surprise</i> due to prediction violations is encoded by local field potential oscillations in the gamma band (&gt;30 Hz), changes to <i>predictions</i> in the beta band (12-30 Hz), and that the <i>precision</i> of predictions appears to quantitatively relate to alpha band oscillations (8-12 Hz). These results confirm oscillatory codes for critical aspects of generative models of perception."
