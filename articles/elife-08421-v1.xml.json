Here, we show that targeted application of compressive forces can catalyze this conformational change in individual PFO complexes trapped at the prepore stage, recapitulating this critical step of the spontaneous process. The free energy landscape determined from these measurements is in good agreement with that obtained from molecular dynamics simulations showing that an equivalent internal force is generated by the interaction of the exposed hydrophobic residues with the membrane. This hydrophobic force is transmitted across the entire structure to produce a compressive stress across a distant, otherwise stable domain, catalyzing its transition from an extended to compact conformation. Single molecule compression is likely to become an important tool to investigate conformational transitions in membrane proteins."

Here, we show that targeted application of compressive forces can catalyze this conformational change in individual PFO complexes trapped at the prepore stage, recapitulating this critical step of the spontaneous process. The free energy landscape determined from these measurements is in good agreement with that obtained from molecular dynamics simulations showing that an equivalent internal force is generated by the interaction of the exposed hydrophobic residues with the membrane. This hydrophobic force is transmitted across the entire structure to produce a compressive stress across a distant, otherwise stable domain, catalyzing its transition from an extended to compact conformation. Single molecule compression is likely to become an important tool to investigate conformational transitions in membrane proteins."

Previous work had identified a mutant PFO protein that arrests at the prepore state. Applying a compressive force to the top of this prepore-trapped PFO as it sits on the membrane transmitted forces across the entire PFO protein. This ultimately produced a compressive force across a distant part of the protein that caused the protein to change from the elongated prepore state to the compact, pore-like shape. If a compressive force was not applied, the PFO protein remained in the prepore state. Czajkowsky et al. further found that this compressive force is naturally produced by distant water-repellent parts of the naturally occurring protein interacting with the cell membrane. Therefore, internal forces can transmit across proteins to drive shape changes in distant regions."

Moreover, pulling on single molecules with tensile forces has enabled detailed probing of functional and structural transitions within proteins, in particular those that involve a separation of specific structural elements (<a href=\"#bib29\">Puchner and Gaub, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">del Rio et al., 2009</a>). Yet, tensile forces cannot be used to probe transitions that involve a decrease in the distance between structural elements such as the closing of a substrate access gate, for example, as the force acts in a direction opposite to the structural movement. In these instances, what is needed is the controlled application of a compressive force at the single molecule level."

During the prepore-to-pore transition, the distance between the D1 and D4 domains is reduced as a result of conformational changes in the D2 domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>): this domain is elongated in the prepore but collapses into a more compact structure in the pore, largely accounting for the remarkable 40 \u00c5 decrease in height relative to the bilayer surface first observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Tilley et al., 2005</a>). Also within this prepore-to-pore step, an \u03b1-helical bundle (the Trans-Membrane Helices (TMHs)) in the D3 domain converts into an amphipathic \u03b2-sheet that inserts in the bilayer and lines the aqueous membrane pore. While these changes in the D2 and D3 domains have been firmly established, the mechanism by which these changes are coordinated remains unresolved. In fact, the physical processes associated with long-distance structural communication in proteins are poorly understood in general (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cui and Karplus, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Whitley and Lee, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2011</a>). Herein, using single molecule compressive force spectroscopy and single molecule AFM together with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that intra-protein stresses are the driving force of the structural coordination between the D2 and D3 domains and, ultimately, the catalyst of the collapse of the D2 domain."

However, extensive equilibrium MD simulations (&gt;0.3\u00a0\u00b5s) of a PFO monomer without the TMHs shows that the D2 domain remains in an extended conformation in the absence of the TMHs interactions, fluctuating in height by only a few \u00c5 (2.9 \u00c5 RMS height deviation) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Thus, the loss of contact with the TMHs alone is insufficient to trigger the conversion of the D2 domain into a compact structure, a conclusion consistent with recent work showing that the TMHs in the thermally trapped PFO prepore are unfolded with significant conformational freedom (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sato et al., 2013</a>)\u00a0while cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images of a related cytotoxin, pneumolysin, showed that the D2 domain in this state is in its extended conformation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Tilley et al., 2005</a>)."

These calculations reveal that the most significant structural effect of this force is the collapse of the D2 domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), with the rest of the structure remaining largely unchanged (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). That is, the tensile force on the TMHs is effectively transmitted through the protein to generate a compressive stress across the D2 domain that can catalyze its collapse. During the simulations, after modest initial changes in conformation, the protein structure remained relatively stable owing to the presence of an energy barrier that prevented further conformational changes. Finally, this barrier was overcome, and the height dropped rapidly to a value \u223c40 \u00c5 lower than its initial height (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In this final conformation, the lower portion of the D2 domain is still a \u03b2-sheet and lies almost perpendicular on the surface of the D4 domain, pivoting at Lys381. More importantly, the D2 domain remains in this compact conformation even after the force is relieved (for &gt;40\u00a0ns) (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that this conformation is a relatively stable state. The D2/D4 interface in this conformation covers 842 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kellermayer et al., 1997</a>) similar to that observed for interfacial contacts in oligomeric proteins (<a href=\"#bib27\">Miller et al., 1987</a>), and the buried hydrophobic residues (Phe75, Tyr389, Tyr415) in the interface (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) likely contributed to the stability of this compact state. As these residues are highly conserved in the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDC) family (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), it is possible that this structure is a common feature of other CDC toxins. For these simulations, the applied force was 250\u00a0pN; different forces consistently produced similar results, but the time scale was significantly longer at lower forces (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Overall this collapsed structure is consistent with the electron-density profile of the pneumolysin pore by cryo-EM (<a href=\"#bib36\">Tilley et al., 2005</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

This landscape (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) exhibits a broad minimum at heights associated with the prepore conformation (from \u221210 to 8 \u00c5) and a local minimum at heights associated with the pore conformation (centered at \u223c40 \u00c5), separated by an energy barrier of \u223c23 kcal/mol (\u223c38 <i>k<sub>B</sub>T</i>) from the prepore minimum. Thus, the extended structure of the D2 domain is indeed associated with the energetically minimized conformation of PFO. Of note, there is a sharp rise in the energy at \u223c25 \u00c5, where the energy increases by \u223c17 kcal/mol over a distance of \u223c6 \u00c5. Such a barrier height would require a time frame of days to be overcome by thermal fluctuations alone (see 'Materials and methods'), far longer than the observed timescales of the prepore-to-pore transition (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hotze et al., 2001</a>).

In this regard, a mutant protein, PFO<sup>G57C-S190C</sup>, has been identified that spontaneously assembles into prepore complexes on the membrane like the wild-type protein but does not proceed to the pore state owing to a disulfide bridge that inhibits the restructuring of the TMHs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hotze et al., 2001</a>).

Thus, this mutant enables investigation of just the energy barrier of the D2 collapse under compressive forces, without any complicating effects associated with the D3-bilayer interaction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Steered MD simulations confirmed that under compressive forces mimicking those that would be applied with AFM, the D2 domain of this mutant recapitulates the same collapse as that of the D2 domain under tensile forces applied to the TMHs (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Indeed, direct application of constant compressive forces with an AFM tip to individual PFO<sup>G57C-S190C</sup> prepore complexes reproducibly induced the characteristic height reduction in the absence of any reducing agent, leaving the general morphology of the complexes otherwise unchanged (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and additional images are presented in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We note that this pore-like structure does not revert back to the prepore conformation upon removing the applied force, indicating that this compact structure is relatively stable, consistent with the MD simulations. We further note that this applied force (110 pN/monomer) is &gt;10-fold smaller than the force required to break a covalent bond over this time period (see 'Materials and methods') (<a href=\"#bib13\">Grandbois et al., 1999</a>)."

In each simulation, the lower loop regions of domain 4 (residues 399 to 404, 434 to 438, 459 to 468, and 489 to 493) were held fixed to mimic their vertically immobile association with the membrane surface during pore formation. A constant force was applied to the C<sub>\u03b1</sub> atoms of residues Met222 and Ser317 following the standard NAMD protocol. The height of the D3 domain was determined from the positions of the C<sub>\u03b1</sub> atoms of Met222 and Ser317. The height of the D2 domain was determined from the locations of the C<sub>\u03b1</sub> atoms of Thr86 and Lys378. The direction of force application for most simulations was chosen as the shortest path from the C<sub>\u03b1</sub> atoms of Met222 and Ser317 to the expected location of the membrane surface, avoiding direct collision with the D4 domain. In particular, this direction corresponds to a \u223c15\u00b0\u00a0tilt from the vertical (the long axis of PFO), away from the protein, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>.

The direction of this pathway is approximately that depicted in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>.

In addition, as with the steered MD simulations, the lower loop residues (residues 399 to 404, 434 to 438, 459 to 468, and 489 to 493) were held fixed during these calculations. Two different ABF runs were performed: first with a distance range between the aforementioned centers-of-mass of 1.5 \u00c5 and then piecing together these results as the initial potential of mean force profile for calculations with distance ranges of 5 \u00c5. The latter were performed to guarantee accuracy of the calculated profile, particularly at the junction between neighboring 1.5 \u00c5 segments. The size of each ABF sampling bin for all calculations was 0.1 \u00c5. All simulations, run within NAMD, were run long enough to observe the convergence of the system to ensure accurate sampling of the free energy profile: at the end of the second ABF run, every ABF 0.1 \u00c5 bin had been sampled over 100,000 times."

For the single molecule compressive force experiments, the composition of the first monolayer (facing mica) was eggPC, and the second monolayer was eggPC:chol at 50:50 mol%. For the experiments with the detergent, supported bilayers of a similar composition were dissolved too quickly following the addition of detergent to enable investigation. Instead, for these experiments, the first monolayer was composed of diynePC and the second monolayer was eggPC:chol (50:50 mol%). Following deposition of the diynePC monolayer onto mica, the sample was irradiated with UV light (Bio-Rad) for 10 min to induce cross-linking of the lipids. As is evident from <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, the PFO<sup>G57C-S190C</sup> complexes proceed to their pore-like height in the presence of DTT, just as in bilayers where the first monolayer is composed of eggPC (<a href=\"#bib6\">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</a>). For all experiments, the final concentration of the protein in the well was \u223c15 \u00b5g/ml, and the buffer in the well consisted of buffer A (10\u00a0mM sodium phosphate, pH 7). After incubating for 45 min, the sample was extensively washed and then, for the compressive force experiments, imaged in the AFM under buffer A. For the experiments with detergent, the sample was first washed in buffer B (10 mM HEPES, 0.1 M NaCl, 25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.5), then washed and incubated for 5 min in buffer B with DDM (at the concentrations indicated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), then washed and incubated for 10 min in buffer B with DDM and 2.5 mM DTT, then washed and incubated for 10 min in buffer B with DDM and 2% glutaraldehyde, followed finally by an extensive wash in buffer B, a final incubation in 20 mM glycine, pH 6, and a final wash and imaging in buffer B. The chemical fixation was necessary because stable imaging of the protein complexes directly in the detergent solution was not possible. The histogram data presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> was determined from imaging five different regions in each of three different samples at each condition. Imaging was performed in the contact mode with a Nanoscope II AFM (Bruker - Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA,\u00a0US) using oxide-sharpened \u2018twin-tip\u2019 Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> cantilevers with a spring constant of 0.06 N/m. The spring constant was verified by measuring the thermal induced oscillation. The typical scan rate was 9 Hz, and the imaging force was minimized to 0.1 nN. The piezoscanner (14 mm, D scanner, Bruker - Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA,\u00a0US) was calibrated using a variety of samples including mica and the cholera toxin B subunit. Scanning electron microscopy of the AFM probe (shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was obtained with a JEOL 7800F microscope (Peabody, MA,\u00a0US)."

                                "text": "Compressive forces have been previously applied with AFM to probe mesoscopic mechanical properties of various biomaterials (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kodama et al., 2005</a>). In our experiments, after obtaining an image of the sample at small applied forces in scan sizes of 300 to \u2013400 nm, the tip was positioned within the center of a given complex by zooming in with progressively smaller scan sizes (generally 2), arriving at a sample location with the complex of interest in the center of a scan size of \u223c80 nm. Once one-half of the complex was imaged, we immediately zoomed in on its center, set the scan size to zero, and then applied the larger constant force for a specific duration (1 or 5\u00a0s). The force was then immediately reduced to detach the tip from any contact from the sample, the scan size was adjusted to \u223c500 nm, and then the tip was re-engaged at smaller forces to obtain an image of the sample to determine whether or not the larger applied force catalyzed the height reduction in the complex. In this way, the applied force was equally distributed on each of the monomers within the complex. No complex was probed more than once. We measured the time between the final zoom-in step and the application of force to be less than 5 s. We measured the extent of lateral drift in our system to be less than 0.03 nm/s, which is similar to published reports (<a href=\"#bib21\">King et al., 2009</a>). Thus, we expect to not have drifted by more than 0.15 nm from the center of the complex prior to force application. As the complex is 35 nm in diameter, this drift imparts only a slight deviation to an equal force on all subunits. Although wild-type PFO complexes and other CDC toxins form a range of sizes, from incomplete arcs to complete rings (<a href=\"#bib6\">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sonnen et al., 2014</a>), these prepore mutant PFO<sup>G57C-S190C</sup> complexes formed almost exclusively complete rings of an identical size. Only the complete rings were studied here. Based on the radial periodicity of the monomers in the complete rings (<a href=\"#bib6\">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</a>)\u00a0and high-resolution images of the rings (data not published), the complete rings contain 36 subunits. Thus, in the text, we referred to the applied force either with respect to the entire complex or to each monomer (dividing the total applied force by 36). As such, the total applied force range used here (1800 pN to \u20133800 pN) corresponds to 50 pN to \u2013106 pN per monomer, which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the force needed to break a covalent bond over this time frame (1400 pN to \u20132000 pN) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Grandbois et al., 1999</a>). On average, more than 30 individual measurements were performed at each applied force, resulting in more than 600 individual single molecule measurements obtained from tens of samples and using tens of different AFM cantilevers."

The conformational changes responsible for the pre-pore to pore transition were previously known. The authors themselves published an article in 2004 in EMBO journal that uses the same di-sulfide-linked mutant in combination with AFM imaging with or without DTT to observe the shrinking of the pore heights due to pore formation. Here, the new contribution is that compressive AFM is used to induce pore formation. Also, steered MD simulations are performed to complement experiments. Importantly, they are able to obtain the transition probability as a function of force magnitude and duration, allowing them to fit the data to a two state model and deduce the distance to the transition state (and less clearly) the free energy barrier. If indeed this is the first time such analysis has been performed, this would be a significant contribution regardless of the novelty and biological significance of the findings themselves. In the physiological context, the force will be applied between D3 and the membrane, largely driven by hydrophobic force, and the compressive force is proposed to mimic this force, which is reasonable. MD simulations provide molecular accounting and some quantitative comparisons. The experiments were performed in an expert fashion, and the data is highly original and of high quality. Because we are not aware of any prior publication measuring a certain rate as a function of compressive force from a single molecule, this work could be a significant contribution even without important biological insights as long as the authors can address important technical issues raised, including a major concern about the validity of the construct used for the study. In addition, the work presents possible mechanisms underlying the transition from prepare to pore of PFO."

The unfolding of the TMHs in the D3 domain are not directly coupled structurally to that of the collapse of the D2 domain, thus the mechanism of D2 conversion remained unresolved prior to our work. That is, the objective of our study was to determine how the D2 domain is driven into its compact conformation, not the insertion of the TMHs into the lipid bilayer per se. As the reviewer correctly pointed out, with the disulfide bridge intact, these mutants cannot form transmembrane pores. But this mutant protein enabled testing of the predictions from the MD simulations of the compressive force-catalyzed collapse of the D2 domain without any complicating effects associated with the D3-bilayer interaction. We have now included a figure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) to further clarify this point. Additional text of explanation is also included in Results and Discussion, third and fifth paragraphs,."

Also, the protein maintains this compact structure even after release of the compressive force, similar to the previous simulations (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

Thus, at most, we expect a drift of less than 0.3 nm from the center of the complex by the end of the force application. As the complex is ~35 nm in diameter, this drift, clearly, imparts only a slight deviation to an equal force on all subunits. We have now added this information to the Methods section, in the subsection \u201cSingle molecule compression with AFM\u201d."

The ultimate probe shape is essentially spherical at the apex and approximately 25 nm in radius, consistent with the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. As this is roughly the same as the diameter of the pore, it is reasonable to assume that the applied force should be more or less equally applied to all subunits within the time frame of each data acquisition. We have now included this information to this figure legend and additional text to the Methods section: \u201cScanning electron microscopy of the AFM probe (shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was obtained with a JEOL 7800F microscope (Peabody, MA).\u201d"

The reason for performing the tensile force MD simulations was the speculation that the tensile force on the TMHs in the actual pore-forming process generates a compressive force across the D2 domain. As such, the D2 would collapse under a compressive force regardless whether it is generated by the membrane insertion of the TMHs or by the AFM probe pushing the top of the protein. This is indeed the case as shown by the MD simulations. Also, we note that, based on AFM and cryo-EM data (EMBO J 23, 3206 (2004), Cell 121, 247 (2005)), the contact of the protein with the lipid bilayer does not change the structure of the D2 domain from that in the monomer. We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and the newly added MD results further supported our approach."

But such simulations are clearly beyond our current computational capability. Furthermore, the interface between the subunits is known to involve only the D1 and D3 domains (and not the D2 domain), but the precise details of this interaction are largely not understood, and remain one of the main enigmas in the complete understanding of pore formation for this class of toxins. These limitations notwithstanding, it is well established that the compaction of the D2 domain is a critical step of the pore formation process, which is the central question we wish to answer in this paper: namely, through what mechanism is the D2 domain compacted? Previous work suggested that oligomerization is responsible for the separation of the D3 domain from contact with the D2 domain, leading to the unraveling of the TMHs. Their contact with the lipid bilayer is the driving force leading to the irreversible compaction of the D2 domain. The latter point is provided by the studies presented in this paper, and we are certainly keen to pursue answers to the other questions in future studies."
