Pathway choice is made at the level of DNA end resection, a nucleolytic processing step, which primes DSBs for repair by recombination. Resection is thus under cell cycle control, but additionally regulated by chromatin and nucleosome remodellers. Here, we show that both layers of control converge in the regulation of resection by the evolutionarily conserved Fun30/SMARCAD1 remodeller. Budding yeast Fun30 and human SMARCAD1 are cell cycle-regulated by interaction with the DSB-localized scaffold protein Dpb11/TOPBP1, respectively. In yeast, this protein assembly additionally comprises the 9-1-1 damage sensor, is involved in localizing Fun30 to damaged chromatin, and thus is required for efficient long-range resection of DSBs. Notably, artificial targeting of Fun30 to DSBs is sufficient to bypass the cell cycle regulation of long-range resection, indicating that chromatin remodelling during resection is underlying DSB repair pathway choice."

Pathway choice is made at the level of DNA end resection, a nucleolytic processing step, which primes DSBs for repair by recombination. Resection is thus under cell cycle control, but additionally regulated by chromatin and nucleosome remodellers. Here, we show that both layers of control converge in the regulation of resection by the evolutionarily conserved Fun30/SMARCAD1 remodeller. Budding yeast Fun30 and human SMARCAD1 are cell cycle-regulated by interaction with the DSB-localized scaffold protein Dpb11/TOPBP1, respectively. In yeast, this protein assembly additionally comprises the 9-1-1 damage sensor, is involved in localizing Fun30 to damaged chromatin, and thus is required for efficient long-range resection of DSBs. Notably, artificial targeting of Fun30 to DSBs is sufficient to bypass the cell cycle regulation of long-range resection, indicating that chromatin remodelling during resection is underlying DSB repair pathway choice."

One of the most toxic forms of DNA damage is the double strand break, in which both strands of the double helix are broken. These breaks can be mended in two ways: by directly joining the broken ends together, or via a process called homologous recombination. In homologous recombination, a duplicate DNA molecule is used as a template to repair the broken DNA strands. These duplicates only form during particular phases of the cell division cycle, which limits when homologous recombination can take place."

This control takes two forms: on the one hand by regulating whether the enzymes that trim the DNA ends are active; and on the other hand by regulating the remodelling of the structure into which DNA is packaged, which is called chromatin. However, it is not known which of these two targets is the limiting factor that determines whether homologous recombination occurs."

During those stages, cell cycle kinases add phosphate groups to Fun30.

At the same time, resection interferes with ligation-based repair (non-homologous end-joining, NHEJ) and thus is the critical step for repair pathway choice. In mitotically dividing cells, recombination-based repair critically depends on the presence of a sister-chromatid. DSB repair pathway choice and accordingly DNA end resection are therefore highly regulated during the cell cycle: in G1 phase, little resection occurs and NHEJ is therefore favoured. Conversely, in S, G2 and M phase, resection is up-regulated and HR becomes more prevalent (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cejka, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ira et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Symington, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Symington and Gautier, 2011</a>)."

Notably, when we bypass the CDK requirement by directly fusing Fun30 to a subunit of the 9-1-1 complex, we observe long-range resection even in G1\u2013arrested cells. This suggests that the cell cycle regulation of long-range resection can be bypassed solely by artificially targeting Fun30 to DSBs. Finally, we show that also human SMARCAD1 binds to TOPBP1 (human ortholog of Dpb11) in a CDK phosphorylation-dependent manner that involves conserved interaction surfaces, suggesting that the formation of a Fun30-Dpb11 complex is a conserved mechanism of cell cycle regulation that could control DNA end resection and repair pathway choice throughout eukaryotes."

Indeed, upon CDK inhibition (using the <i>cdc28-as1</i> allele and 1-NMPP1 inhibition) Dpb11 binding to Fun30 was strongly reduced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Accordingly, purified Fun30<sup>3FLAG</sup> was able to interact with <sup>GST</sup>Dpb11-BRCT1+2 in vitro but only after pre-phosphorylation by CDK (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), suggesting that the Fun30-Dpb11 interaction as well as its regulation by CDK phosphorylation are direct. Therefore, we sought to identify the CDK phosphorylation sites on Fun30, which are relevant for Dpb11 binding. Interaction mapping using truncated constructs placed the Dpb11\u00a0interaction site close to the N-terminus of Fun30 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Since conventional phospho-mimetic mutations failed to promote binding (data not shown), we generated a covalent fusion of the Fun30-SSAA protein directly to Dpb11\u25b3N lacking BRCT1+2\u00a0(<i>FUN30-AA-DPB11-276-C</i>\u00a0expressed as the\u00a0only copy of Fun30 from the\u00a0endogenous promoter, referred to as <i>FUN30-DPB11</i> fusion in the following). Importantly, the fusion protein localized efficiently to damaged chromatin and thus restored the defect of the <i>fun30-SSAA</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). This finding suggests that the interaction with Dpb11 is indeed involved in targeting Fun30 to DSBs and that the covalent fusion is sufficient to bypass the CDK regulation of Fun30. Notably, DSB recruitment of the Fun30-Dpb11 fusion protein was stronger than\u00a0Fun30 consistent with the replacement of a transient, PTM-dependent interaction by a covalent interaction. Therefore, we reason that the <i>FUN30-DPB11</i> fusion deregulates Fun30 in two ways: first, it uncouples Fun30 from its cell cycle regulation. Second, it leads to enhanced DSB\u00a0localization to DSBs, thus potentially enhancing Fun30 activity at damaged chromatin."

Our data thus suggest the existence of two Fun30\u2013targeting mechanisms: one that is Dpb11-dependent and recruits Fun30 to sites of ongoing resection, and a second that is Dpb11-independent and tethers Fun30 to DNA that has already been resected."

We measured resection at an HO-induced, non-repairable DSB in M phase-arrested cells using the combined read-out of (a) the accumulation of the ssDNA-binding protein RPA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, upper panel) around the DSB by ChIP and (b) the specific DNA loss (occurring due to ssDNA formation, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, lower panel). Indeed, compared to <i>WT</i> cells, <i>fun30\u25b3</i> mutants showed a pronounced defect in long-range resection, visible by a reduced spreading of both RPA-ChIP and DNA loss, to regions greater than 10 kb away from the break (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), confirming previous observations (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Costelloe et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Eapen et al., 2012</a>). Notably, the same defect in long-range resection was also observed in the Dpb11-binding\u00a0deficient <i>fun30-SSAA</i> mutant and was fully restored by the <i>FUN30-DPB11</i> fusion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To corroborate these findings, we also analysed resection-dependent DSB repair in a single-strand annealing (SSA) assay, where cellular survival upon an HO-induced DSB in the absence of Rad51 critically depends on the efficient resection of 25 kb of DNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, [<a href=\"#bib57\">Vaze et al., 2002</a>]). In fact, Dpb11-binding\u00a0deficient <i>fun30</i> mutants were deficient in SSA-mediated survival and this defect was completely rescued by covalent fusion\u00a0of\u00a0Fun30-SSAA to Dpb11 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, the CDK-regulated interaction between Fun30 and Dpb11 is required for efficient long-range\u00a0resection as well as subsequent resection-coupled repair."

Similar to what has been described for the <i>fun30\u25b3</i> mutant, we observed that the CPT-hypersensitivity of the <i>fun30-SSAA</i> was suppressed by an additional <i>rad9\u00a0</i>deletion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), suggesting that the Fun30-Dpb11 complex antagonizes Rad9. Interestingly, Rad9 also binds to Dpb11, and Fun30 and Rad9 share the same interaction site on Dpb11 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pfander and Diffley, 2011</a>). While it is currently unknown whether Dpb11-associated Rad9 (in contrast to nucleosome-associated Rad9) contributes to the inhibition of DNA end resection, the overlapping binding site raised the possibility that Fun30 may interfere with Rad9 function via competition. Therefore, in order to exclude that the <i>FUN30-DPB11</i> fusion rescues resection simply by blocking the Rad9-Dpb11 interaction, we inactivated the ATPase activity of Fun30 by a Walker A motif mutation (K603R) in the context of the <i>FUN30-DPB11</i> fusion and found the K603R mutant fusion did not restore <i>WT</i> resistance to CPT (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, competition does not explain the effects of the <i>FUN30-DPB11</i> fusion and the catalytic activity of Fun30 is required for the resection-promoting function of the Fun30-Dpb11 complex.

Previous efforts to bypass this regulation have focussed on nucleases (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huertas et al., 2008</a>). Thus, we tested if the CDK-regulation of Fun30 may contribute to the cell\u00a0cycle regulation of DNA end resection or may even be a limiting factor for this regulation. We used the <i>DDC1-FUN30</i> fusion, which in contrast to <i>WT</i> Fun30 efficiently localized to a DSB in G1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This indicates that the fusion may in principle allow Fun30 to act on damaged chromatin in G1, consistent with 9-1-1 being loaded to damaged chromatin in G1 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barlow et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Janke et al., 2010</a>). Indeed, the <i>DDC1</i>-<i>FUN30</i> fusion protein promoted resection in G1 to a significantly larger reach compared to <i>WT</i> Fun30, since RPA recruitment could be observed up to 25 kb distance from the DSB (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Notably, the spreading of resection under the <i>DDC1</i>-<i>FUN30</i> conditions was even more pronounced than in <i>WT</i> cells arrested in M phase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This effect is thus consistent with the very efficient targeting of Fun30 to DNA damage sites by the <i>DDC1-FUN30</i> fusion. This hyperactivation of resection thus indicates that forced tethering of Fun30 to DSB sites is able to bypass the bottleneck that limits long-range resection in G1."

                                "text": "It needs to be pointed out that within the resected region the fold enrichment of RPA recruitment and the extent of DNA loss was not restored to similar levels as observed in M phase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Moreover, precise ligation of a cut plasmid by NHEJ did not appear to be influenced by the <i>DDC1-FUN30</i> fusion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). These data thus suggest that the overall cell cycle regulation of DNA end resection was not bypassed completely, presumably because other resection proteins and in particular resection initiation are additional targets of cell cycle regulation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albuquerque et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huertas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pfander and Diffley, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). We therefore compared G1 resection in the <i>DDC1-FUN30</i> strain to another mutant \u2013 <i>sae2-S267E</i> \u2013 that is thought to at least partially bypass the CDK regulation of resection initiation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cannavo and Cejka, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Huertas, 2010</a>). Notably, the <i>sae2-S267E</i> mutant showed no increase in the reach of resection and only led to a slight increase in the fold enrichment of the RPA ChIP, both in <i>WT</i> and <i>DDC1-FUN30</i> background (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Overall, these data are thus consistent with a model, whereby <i>sae2-S267E</i> partially bypasses the cell cycle regulation of resection initiation, while the <i>DDC1-FUN30</i> fusion\u00a0bypasses the cell cycle regulation of long-range\u00a0resection. This highlights that chromatin has a barrier function towards resection and that formation of the Fun30-Dpb11 complex is the limiting step that needs to be up-regulated during recombination-permissive cell cycle phases in order to overcome this barrier."

                                "text": "Fun30\u2019s role in promoting DNA end resection is conserved to its human ortholog SMARCAD1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Costelloe et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Densham et al., 2016</a>). Strikingly, in an independent screen we identified an N-terminal fragment of SMARCAD1 (aa 55\u2013274) as interactor of TOPBP1 (using a TOPBP1 BRCT0-2 construct), the human ortholog of Dpb11. Furthermore, we found this interaction to require the phospho-protein\u00a0binding sites of TOPBP1 BRCT1+2 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We verified the SMARCAD1-TOPBP1 interaction in a pulldown approach using purified GST-TOPBP1-BRCT0/1/2 fragments and in vitro phosphorylation of cell extracts with purified CDK. GFP-SMARCAD1-55-445 bound efficiently to GST-TOPBP1-BRCT0/1/2, but only after addition of active CDK to the cell extract (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). This suggests that CDK phosphorylation promotes the interaction, similar to the regulation in yeast. We therefore queried for the TOPBP1 interaction site on SMARCAD1 using mutagenesis of CDK consensus motifs. Using this approach, we found that the T71A variant, but none of the other S/TP site mutants tested caused strongly reduced TOPBP1 binding in two-hybrid and Co-IP (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data therefore suggest that SMARCAD1 interacts with TOPBP1 via the CDK-site T71. To our surprise, we observed in two-hybrid experiments that human SMARCAD1 also interacted with yeast Dpb11 and in a manner that was dependent on the T71 phosphorylation site (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), despite low sequence conservation. This raised the possibility that SMARCAD1 and FUN30 could also functionally complement each other. Expression of SMARCAD1 from the inducible GAL-promoter lead only to a slight suppression of the CPT sensitivity of a <i>fun30\u25b3</i> strain (data not shown), suggesting that there is an aspect of Fun30 function or regulation that is not recapitulated by SMARCAD1. In contrast, when we generated a SMARCAD1-Fun30 chimera lacking the Dpb11-binding region of Fun30 but containing the TOPBP1-binding region of SMARCAD1 (SMARCAD1-1-300-FUN30-30-C), this chimera was largely able to rescue the CPT sensitivity of the <i>fun30\u25b3</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s5\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In contrast, the Fun30-30-C fragment alone was unable to provide a rescue and showed reduced protein stability as well (without tag or GFP-tagged, figure <a href=\"#fig9s4\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplements 4</a>,<a href=\"#fig9s6\">6</a>). This experiment may thus indicate that the TOPBP1-binding region of SMARCAD1 could replace the Dpb11-binding region of Fun30 in vivo. Overall, we therefore conclude from the data in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> that the Fun30/SMARCAD1 interaction with Dpb11/TOPBP1, its regulation by CDK phosphorylation and the corresponding interaction surfaces show a remarkable conservation over more than a billion years of eukaryotic evolution."

In budding yeast, this interaction seems to facilitate localization of Fun30 to damaged chromatin in a manner that depends on the 9-1-1 complex. Notably, other interactions may also contribute to Fun30 targeting or function, given that Fun30 was shown to interact with RPA and nucleases (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2012</a>) and that SMARCAD1 was recently shown to interact with H2A-ubiquitin (<a href=\"#bib21\">Densham et al., 2016</a>). Importantly, however, our data suggests that the interaction with Dpb11 and 9-1-1 is essential for the resection function of Fun30 during the cell cycle. In contrast to the Fun30-Dpb11 complex, the other interactions are seemingly cell cycle-independent and future research will need to show whether they are at all critical for Fun30/SMARCAD1 function."

It seems clear that Fun30 antagonizes the resection inhibitor Rad9 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2012</a>), but different, non-exclusive mechanisms remain possible. For example, Fun30 could directly remove Rad9 from DNA damage sites or render Rad9-containing chromatin resection-permissive, but also could interfere with Rad9 recruitment by changing chromatin composition. We predict that our system of forced targeting Fun30 to damaged chromatin will be useful to discriminate between these possibilities in the future."

Dpb11 thus interacts with pro-\u00a0and anti-resection factors, and the same is true for TOPBP1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cescutti et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Moudry et al., 2016</a>). It will thus be interesting to figure out in the future, how binding of potential antagonizing factors is balanced."

                        "text": "Overall, our data suggest that at least two layers of cell cycle regulation of DNA end resection can be distinguished. First, nucleases and nuclease-associated factors are substrate for CDK phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huertas et al., 2008</a>) and this may directly activate these enzymes, as has for example been shown for the endonuclease activity of MRX-Sae2 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cannavo and Cejka, 2014</a>). Second, chromatin and nucleosome remodellers may be regulated in a way that generates resection-permissive chromatin at damage sites in cell cycle phases when resection is favoured. The Fun30-Dpb11 complex clearly falls in this second category, as does perhaps Rad9/53BP1, the cell cycle regulation of which we are only beginning to understand (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cescutti et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pfander and Diffley, 2011</a>). Notably, deregulation of the second layer such as in the experiments with the\u00a0<i>DDC1-FUN30</i> fusion has so far been the most successful strategy to bypass the cell cycle regulation of DNA end resection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This emphasizes the importance of resection regulation by its chromatin substrate and suggests that chromatin (more specifically the Fun30 target on chromatin) is the factor that limits long-range resection in G1 phase cells."

Notwithstanding the overall complexity of DSB repair pathway choice, our results suggest that modification of the DSB-surrounding chromatin by Fun30/SMARCAD1 should be explored further \u2013 particularly in higher eukaryotes \u2013 as a tool to experimentally channel DSBs into the HR pathway independently of cell cycle stage."

A double-strand break was introduced by inducing the HO endonuclease from the galactose promoter by addition of galactose to the cultures (2% final). 100 ml samples were crosslinked with formaldehyde (final 1%) for 16 min at indicated timepoints and the reaction was quenched with glycine. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in ice-cold PBS and snap-frozen (RPA ChIPs) or directly processed (Fun30-<sup>3FLAG</sup> ChIPs). For lysis, cell pellets were resuspended in 800 \u03bcl lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-deoxycolate, 0.1% SDS) and grinded with zirconia beads using a bead beating device. The chromatin was sonified to shear the DNA to a size of 200\u2013500 bp. Subsequently the extracts were cleared by centrifugation, 1% was taken as input sample and 40% were incubated with either anti FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma\u00a0Munich, Germany) for 2 hr (Fun30-<sup>3FLAG</sup> ChIPs) or 1.5 hr with anti RFA antibody (AS07-214, Agrisera\u00a0V\u00e4nn\u00e4s, Sweden) followed by 30 min with Dynabeads ProteinA (Invitrogen\u00a0Schwerte, Germany, for RPA ChIPs). The beads were washed 3x in lysis buffer, 2x in lysis buffer with 500 mM NaCl, 2x in wash buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 0.25 M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate) and 2x in TE pH 8.0. DNA-protein complexes were eluted in 1% SDS, proteins were removed with Proteinase K (3 hr, 42\u00b0C) and crosslinks were reversed (8 hr or overnight, 65\u00b0C). The DNA was subsequently purified using phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and quantified by quantitative PCR (Roche LightCycler480 System, KAPA SYBR FAST 2x qpCR Master Mix, KAPA Biosystems\u00a0London, UK) at indicated positions with respect to the DNA double-strand break.

This complex, together with 9-1-1 is important for long range resection in S-M phase. Fusion of Fun30 to a component of 9-1-1 complex or Dpb11 substitutes the need for Fun30 phosphorylation and even restores resection in G1 blocked cells. Evidence for a similar cell cycle control of resection and interaction between human orthologues (SMARCAD1:TOPBP1) is provided. Together this report uncovers new mechanism of cell cycle regulation of DSB ends resection and proposes a possible strategy to optimize gene targeting in G1/post-mitotic cells.

Second, we generate more efficient Fun30 recruitment to damaged chromatin than would be seen for the WT protein (see Fun30 ChIPs in Figure.6\u2014figure supplement 3). This could lead to Fun30 hyperactivation. In fact, we generated the Ddc1-Fun30 specifically for this effect, because we reasoned that it would target Fun30 to damaged chromatin even more efficiently than the Fun30-Dpb11 fusion. Moreover, in case of the Ddc1-Fun30 fusion we have clear indication that it leads to Fun30 hyperactivation, as was rightly pointed out by the reviewers. In case of the Fun30-Dpb11 fusion we do not have such clear evidence of hyperactivation (the SSA efficiency in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> is in our opinion similar to WT), even though recruitment to DSBs is more efficient than in WT cells.

From this we conclude that (1) the cell cycle regulation of other factors, which also contributes to the overall cell cycle regulation of DNA end resection, could potentially be overridden by the hyperactivation of Fun30. Notably we also conclude from this finding that (2) Fun30 activity is most likely limiting to resection in WT cells."

In the revised version of our manuscript, we used two mutants (next to our <i>fun30-SSAA</i>) to specifically address the effect of mutations in the upstream factors: the 9-1-1 mutant <i>ddc1-T602A</i> (deficient in binding to and recruiting Dpb11) and the Dpb11 mutant <i>sld3-dpb11\u0394N</i> (DPB11 is an essential gene, but the Fun30 interaction site (BRCT1+2) can be truncated if fused to Sld3 (Zegerman et al, Nature, 2007)). As predicted by the model, both mutants indeed lead to a reduction in Fun30 ChIPs to damaged chromatin. As discussed already in the context of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a> (Fun30 ChIP in the <i>fun30-SSAA</i> mutant) there is residual recruitment occurring in all mutant backgrounds affecting the 9\u20101-1-Dpb11-Fun30 pathway. Most likely this reflects a 9-1-1-Dpb11-independent mode of recruitment. As we speculate in the paper, Fun30 could be targeted to resected DNA via an RPA interaction (Chen et al., Nature, 2012). We reason that the second pathway may depend on resection, which would explain why Fun30 recruitment in the <i>fun30-SSAA</i> mutant (which is resection-deficient) is more strongly defective than in the <i>ddc1-T602A</i> mutant (which is not resection-deficient, because it also influences Rad9 (our unpublished data). Importantly, however, the <i>fun30-SSAA</i> mutant is as defective in resection as the <i>fun30\u0394</i> mutant. This suggests that, even though other recruitment mechanisms may exist, it is the 9-1-1-Dpb11-Fun30 pathway, which is essential for efficient DNA end resection."
