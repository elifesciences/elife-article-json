Histidine kinases (HK) are the sensory component, transferring information toward downstream response regulators (RR). HKs transfer phosphoryl groups to their specific RRs, but also dephosphorylate them, overall ensuring proper signaling. The mechanisms by which HKs discriminate between such disparate directions, are yet unknown. We now disclose crystal structures of the HK:RR complex DesK:DesR from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, comprising snapshots of the phosphotransfer and the dephosphorylation reactions. The HK dictates the reactional outcome through conformational rearrangements that include the reactive histidine. The phosphotransfer center is asymmetric, poised for dissociative nucleophilic substitution. The structural bases of HK phosphatase/phosphotransferase control are uncovered, and the unexpected discovery of a dissociative reactional center, sheds light on the evolution of TCS phosphotransfer reversibility. Our findings should be applicable to a broad range of signaling systems and instrumental in synthetic TCS rewiring."

Histidine kinases (HK) are the sensory component, transferring information toward downstream response regulators (RR). HKs transfer phosphoryl groups to their specific RRs, but also dephosphorylate them, overall ensuring proper signaling. The mechanisms by which HKs discriminate between such disparate directions, are yet unknown. We now disclose crystal structures of the HK:RR complex DesK:DesR from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, comprising snapshots of the phosphotransfer and the dephosphorylation reactions. The HK dictates the reactional outcome through conformational rearrangements that include the reactive histidine. The phosphotransfer center is asymmetric, poised for dissociative nucleophilic substitution. The structural bases of HK phosphatase/phosphotransferase control are uncovered, and the unexpected discovery of a dissociative reactional center, sheds light on the evolution of TCS phosphotransfer reversibility. Our findings should be applicable to a broad range of signaling systems and instrumental in synthetic TCS rewiring."

Signaling pathways enable cells to regulate genetic and biochemical programs for adaptation and survival. Two-component systems (TCSs) play a particularly important role among protein machineries that cells have evolved to carry out signaling, widely distributed in bacteria, fungi and plants. The simplest TCSs comprise a sensory histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR) component (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gao and Stock, 2009</a>). The signal is transmitted downstream from HK to RR, through an orderly sequence of conformational rearrangements coupled to phosphoryl-transfer reactions. The HK is turned on or off after signal-dependent allosteric rearrangements, which control autophosphorylation on a conserved histidine residue. The phosphoryl group is then transferred from the phosphorylated kinase to a conserved aspartate on the RR receiver domain, activating it to effect a specific output response. When auto-kinase activity is turned off, HKs often act as a phosphatase of their cognate phosphorylated RR (P~RR) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Goulian, 2010</a>), contributing to shutting down the pathway. Despite being paradoxical for a protein kinase, the phosphatase activity of HKs is physiologically relevant ensuring robust homeostatic responses (<a href=\"#bib69\">Schramke et al., 2016</a>)."

Trans-membrane HKs display the catalytic region in the cytoplasm and the sensory domain within the lipid bilayer or toward the extracellular/periplasmic space. The catalytic core typically includes a helical Dimerization and Histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) domain, followed by a <b>C</b>atalytic and ATP-binding (CA) domain. HKs are classified according to DHp sequence signatures in HisKA, HisKA_2, HisKA_3, HWE_HK and His_kinase families. CheA-like HKs instead harbor the reactive His within a Histidine <b>P</b>hospho<b>t</b>ransfer (HPt) domain that is not involved in dimerization. Overall sequence conservation among HKs can be very low, but the entire catalytic region is remarkably conserved at the structural level (<a href=\"#bib91\">Zschiedrich et al., 2016</a>), suggesting that functional mechanisms are shared. RRs comprise a receiver domain (REC), which may be adjacent to additional effector domains (DNA binding, enzymatic, etc.). REC phosphorylation stabilizes structural rearrangements associated with effector domain activation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gao and Stock, 2010</a>)."

HKs have evolved to catalyze irreversible phosphotransfer reactions (<a href=\"#bib61\">Porter et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Potter et al., 2002</a>) ensuring a\u00a0unidirectional input\u2192output information flow (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bourret and Stock, 2002</a>). However, evolutionary pressure has also resulted in signaling pathways where reversible steps are simultaneously required, mostly in phosphorelays (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burbulys et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Janiak-Spens et al., 2005</a>), where dedicated HPt modules act as phospho-donors and -acceptors. The molecular bases underlying such differential reversibility patterns remain unknown, raising the question of how signaling pathway directionality is ensured, from input signal to adaptive response."

We had previously shown that the HK DesK, a member of the HisKA_3 family, undergoes important conformational changes to switch between phosphatase- and phosphotransfer-competent states (<a href=\"#bib3\">Albanesi et al., 2009</a>). The cytoplasmic portion of DesK (DesKC) including its entire catalytic region, displays a symmetric and rigid structure in the phosphatase state. DesK activation implies its rearrangement into an auto-kinase competent form with substantially higher flexibility. Upon auto-phosphorylation DesKC adopts a strongly asymmetric conformation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Albanesi et al., 2009</a>) able to transfer the phosphoryl group to DesR, its downstream RR partner. The DHp \u03b1-helices include a conserved membrane-proximal coiled-coil motif, upstream of the phosphorylatable His. Such DHp segment is critical for signal transmission, folding into a coiled-coil in the phosphatase state, whereas in the phosphotransferase form this coiled-coil breaks apart (<a href=\"#bib66\">Saita et al., 2015</a>). We now report the\u00a0crystal structures of the DesKC:DesR complex, trapped in the phosphatase and the phosphotransferase functional states. Extensive conformational rearrangements reveal how the two reaction centers are remodeled. Our data indicate that the relative orientation and distance of the reactive histidine with respect to the receiver aspartate is a molecular determinant controlling signal directionality."

(<b>B</b>) Crystal structure of the phosphatase complex depicting the contents of the asymmetric unit (one whole 2:2 HK:RR complex and half of a second one) and the crystallographically related moieties that complete the second complex. Solid cartoon representation is used for the ASU components, whereas the half-complex generated by the two-fold symmetry operator is highlighted in transparent colors. The two-fold axis is marked in black. Two orthogonal views are displayed (left and right panels). The N-terminal coiled-coil is formed in one of the complexes present in the asymmetric unit (in green and purple). The second complex shows two alternative conformations towards this N-terminal end, only one of which allowed for confident modeling, revealing a disrupted coiled-coil (in red and yellow). The alternate conformation appears to be forming the coiled-coil structure, but was\u00a0not included given the weak electron density map. The N-terminal ends of both complexes are establishing crystal contacts with neighboring molecules, and different dehydration treatment of the crystals appear to force this alternative conformation (data not shown). Fitting analysis of the SAXS curves suggests that the closed conformation of the N-terminal end is the most abundant species in solution (see <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>).

Several features indicate that this complex represents a snapshot of the phosphatase reaction, hereafter denominated the \u2018phosphatase complex\u2019. Symmetric organizations are a hallmark of HKs in the \u2018auto-kinase off / phosphatase on\u2019 states (<a href=\"#bib3\">Albanesi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Casino et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Yamada et al., 2009</a>). The phosphatase complex we have now crystallized indeed displays high symmetry, both in the way the REC domains associate to the HK dimer, as well as between HK monomers. The two independently refined phosphatase complexes show one dimer of DesKC<sub>STAB</sub> bound to two molecules of DesR-REC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), with the latter occupying equivalent positions on either side of the HK core. The 2:2 HK:RR stoichiometry was confirmed in solution by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), revealing an entropy-driven, endothermic association reaction. Size exclusion chromatography-coupled small-angle X ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) further supported the 2:2 stoichiometry (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Tables 3</a> and <a href=\"#tbl4\">4</a>). There is also a\u00a0high internal symmetry between both HK monomers, with CA domains rigidly fixed onto the central DHp and a resulting butterfly-like shape of the whole molecule. A second feature consistent with a phosphatase-competent configuration, is that one AMP-PCP (ATP analogue) moiety is bound to each CA domain, far (&gt;27 \u00c5) from the His<sub>188(HK)</sub> phosphorylation sites on the central DHp, precluding auto-kinase activity (subscripts HK and RR highlight the protein to which the indicated residues belong). Finally, the structural rearrangements triggered at high temperatures (<a href=\"#bib66\">Saita et al., 2015</a>), driving DesK to its phosphatase state, have been linked to the stabilization of an N-terminal coiled-coil (<a href=\"#bib3\">Albanesi et al., 2009</a>). The three point-mutations engineered within DesK helix \u03b11, are indeed observed to stabilize a coiled-coil structure toward the N-terminus in the phosphatase complex (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Coiled-coil stabilization was devised according to previous structures of free DesKC<sub>H188V</sub> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Albanesi et al., 2009</a>), a mutant version that maintains normal P~DesR-specific phosphatase activities in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albanesi et al., 2004</a>). Free DesKC<sub>H188V</sub> structures superimpose extremely well onto the HK partner of the phosphatase complex (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). SEC-SAXS data further suggest that the coiled-coil conformation in the phosphatase complex was the most abundant species in solution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>), involving a large \u03b11:\u03b11 dimerization interface of\u00a0~2100 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D and E</a>). Regarding the RR component within the phosphatase complex, the three DesR-REC molecules in the ASU display identical \u2018active-like\u2019 structures (<a href=\"#bib77\">Trajtenberg et al., 2014</a>). BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2013</sup> moieties mimicking phosphoryl groups are observed bonded to each phosphorylatable Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub>, and coordinated to Mg<sup>2+</sup> cations, consistent with this crystal form being a snapshot of the phosphatase reaction at its pre-dephosphorylation step."

The crystal structure was eventually solved by using the phosphomimetic DesKC<sub>H188E</sub> mutant in complex with DesR-REC. Three X ray diffraction datasets were obtained from DesKC<sub>H188E</sub>:DesR-REC crystals soaked with different concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2013</sup> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The three structures are similar, showing two DesKC<sub>H188E</sub>:DesR-REC complexes in the ASU (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). A number of observations readily distinguish this complex from the phosphatase one, supporting it has captured a ground state of the P~HK\u2192RR phosphoryl-transfer reaction, hereafter referred to as the \u2018phosphotransferase complex\u2019. In the first place, the phosphotransferase complex is highly asymmetric, a typical feature of phosphorylated and kinase-active forms of HKs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Albanesi et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib50\">Mechaly et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Casino et al., 2014</a>). One DesKC<sub>H188E</sub> dimer was observed bound to one DesR-REC monomer in the crystal. This 2:1 stoichiometry was further supported by ITC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) and SEC-SAXS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Tables 3</a> and <a href=\"#tbl4\">4</a>) in solution. The symmetry is also broken within the HK dimer, with one of the two CAs interacting with the DHp helix \u03b11 of the other protomer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The second CA domain is free, visible in the structure due to fortuitous crystal packing contacts. Such arrangement leaves only one RR-binding site available on the HK in the phosphotransferase state, explaining the asymmetric stoichiometry. Secondly, structural superposition of the HK partner extracted from the phosphotransferase complex, with the available structure of free phosphorylated DesK (<i>wt</i> P~DesKC [PDB 3GIG]), reveals closely similar conformations (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), confirming that the structure of DesKC<sub>H188E</sub> in complex is a reliable model of the <i>wt</i> phosphorylated species. Finally, BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2013</sup> was not observed bonded to Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub> in any of the DesKC<sub>H188E</sub>:DesR-REC complex structures, despite testing elevated soaking concentrations. Yet, the phosphorylation sites of the RR partners are very similar compared to the phosphatase complex, allowing for the Mg<sup>2+</sup> cation to bind alike (the cation was observed bound only in phosphotransferase complex structures soaked with high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations). The absence of BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the phosphotransferase state, even though Mg<sup>2+</sup> was eventually bound, is consistent with phosphorylated HKs not interacting with phosphorylated RR species. The molecular basis for a decreased BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> affinity in the phosphotransferase became clear later by comparing both states\u2019 reaction centers (see below). Taken together, the evidence indicates the phosphotransferase complex represents a snapshot of the transfer reaction, prior to the P~His\u2192Asp phosphoryl group migration."

Concerning the DHp domain, a large rotational shift is observed on the membrane-proximal side of the phosphorylation site (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), in contrast to the distal RR-binding site, which remains essentially invariant. The relative orientation of the CA domains is also dramatically changed (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). On the other hand, the RR REC domain adopts a unique conformation in both complexes, with an average rmsd of 0.3 \u00c5 aligning all C\u03b1 atoms, and no significant contrast clustering phosphatase vs phosphotransferase structures (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). Interestingly, this conformation adopted by the REC domain in complex with the kinase, combines structural features of both active and inactive states as seen in the free forms of RRs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gao and Stock, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Trajtenberg et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Namely, the \u03b24\u03b14 loop and \u03b25 strand emulate the inactive RR, while the rest of the protein resembles the free phosphorylated species. The \u03b24\u03b14 loop is closed in phosphorylated RRs (e.g. PDB 4LE0), coupled to a fully wound first turn of helix \u03b14 (Pro<sub>85(RR)</sub> displays a dihedral \u03c8 angle near \u221240\u00b0, allowing for \u03b1-helicity). The REC molecules in both phosphatase and phosphotransferase complexes, show instead this \u03b24\u03b14 loop open (with Pro<sub>85(RR)</sub> \u03c8 angles of respectively 126\u00b0 and 130\u00b0, and the first turn of \u03b14 unwound, as observed in the inactive state of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free protein [PDB 4LE1]). Thus acting as a \u2018phosphate lid\u2019, the \u03b24\u03b14 loop opens and closes to control phosphoryl-transfer chemistry on Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."

Dashed outlines highlight the regions that most resemble each functional state.

An\u00a0~80\u00b0 rotation of helix \u03b11 is coupled to a cogwheel-like shift of helix \u03b12, at the level of the phosphorylation site within the DHp domain (<a href=\"#bib3\">Albanesi et al., 2009</a>). This rotation includes the phosphorylatable His<sub>188(HK)</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), which had not been previously observed. Due to this shift, the side chain of His<sub>188(HK)</sub> ends up buried in the phosphatase state, establishing a H-bond with the same residue of the other protomer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), displaced away from the reaction center as compared to the phosphotransferase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Asp<sub>189(HK)</sub> right next to the phosphorylation site, follows a similarly dramatic rearrangement, well positioned only in the phosphatase complex to make a salt bridge with Arg<sub>84(RR)</sub>. Neighboring Phe<sub>82(RR)</sub> thus inserts its aromatic side chain into a hydrophobic pocket formed between DHp \u03b11 of one HK protomer and \u03b12\u2019 of the other (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). That the reactive histidine moves away from the catalytic site in the phosphatase state is consistent with its marginal role in P~RR dephosphorylation catalysis in HisKA_3 HKs. Indeed, the phosphorylatable His was proved nonessential for NarX-mediated P~NarL dephosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huynh et al., 2010</a>). His has been implicated in EnvZ-mediated phosphatase catalysis (<a href=\"#bib90\">Zhu et al., 2000</a>) in which case its imidazole would act as a base assisting the attack of water on the P~aspartyl group (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bhate et al., 2015</a>). But contradictory results cast doubts on such a direct role (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hsing and Silhavy, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Skarphol et al., 1997</a>). Instead, a Gln in HisKA_3 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huynh et al., 2010</a>), corresponding to Gln<sub>193(HK)</sub> in DesK, or a Thr/Asn in HisKA HKs (<a href=\"#bib83\">Willett and Kirby, 2012</a>), equivalently positioned one helical turn C-terminal to the phosphorylatable His, play a key role in the phosphatase reaction, positioning a catalytic water molecule. Such water or hydroxide molecule is well located to perform the nucleophilic attack on the phosphoryl group, as observed in the P~CheY3 phosphatase CheX (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pazy et al., 2010</a>), a shared geometry among phosphatases and HKs as we now observe in the DesKC:DesR-REC phosphatase complex (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

This shift accounts for the capacity of Thr<sub>80(RR)</sub> to be at H-bonding distance from the P~His<sub>188(HK)</sub> phosphoryl moiety, accompanying its transfer, and maintaining the H-bond to the phosphate on P~Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

How is immediate P~RR dephosphorylation prevented once the phosphate has been transferred? The side chain of Thr<sub>80(RR)</sub> at the end of \u03b24 strand, appears to drive the whole phosphate lid to a closed configuration, escorting the phosphoryl group during P~His\u2192Asp migration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4D</a>).

Yet, comparing <i>wt</i> P~DesR with point-mutants P~DesR<sub>F82A</sub> or P~DesR<sub>R84A</sub>, no change was detected in their marginal abilities to transfer the phosphoryl group back to DesK (data not shown). There is however a parameter that was found to discriminate irreversible phosphotransfer systems from others that reveal appreciable reversibility: the reactional His-Asp distance. The distance between P~His<sub>188(HK)</sub>N\u03b52 and Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub>O\u03b41 in the phosphotransferase complex is\u00a0~7.6 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5C</a>), strongly suggesting that the phosphotransfer reaction occurs through a loose (or predominantly dissociative) nucleophilic substitution mechanism. This is in contrast to what has been observed in reversible complexes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), which efficiently catalyze phosphotransfer also in the opposite, P~Asp\u2192His direction. The latter display significantly shorter N\u03b52-to-O\u03b41 distances, consistent with an associative nucleophilic mechanism (<a href=\"#tbl6\">Table 6</a>).

Further supporting that this ensemble of conformations is functionally relevant, molecular dynamics simulations of the phosphotransferase complex (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) recapitulated the gliding shifts of one partner with respect to the other, reaching the different arrangements observed in the crystal structures at different moments of the simulations (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Loose HK:RR association architectures can actually be observed in other TCS-related complexes (<a href=\"#bib87\">Zapf et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Casino et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Willett et al., 2015</a>), suggesting it is a universal feature. This explains the considerable promiscuity reported in different TCSs in in vitro assays, if long enough incubation times are allowed for a given HK to phosphotransfer to different RRs, including surrogate partners (<a href=\"#bib75\">Skerker et al., 2005</a>). HK:RR interactions thus ensure high specificity, but also avoiding exceedingly high stability, which would hinder proper functional modulation and, ultimately, signal transmission altogether. Evolutionarily selected to be loose, slippery interfaces are inherently tolerant for substantial sequence variation of protein:protein contacting residues. Such tolerance is consistent with the extensive degeneracy found in TCS pairs (<a href=\"#bib60\">Podgornaia and Laub, 2015</a>), likely a general feature of HK:RR interactions. However, a permissive tendency for substitutions would appear to be contradictory with the high protein:protein specificity requirements of these systems. The DesK:DesR structures now provide with molecular details explaining why epistasis is found as a key property of HK:RR interfaces (<a href=\"#bib60\">Podgornaia and Laub, 2015</a>). Epistatic amino acid changes are those that depend on the presence of other substitutions, leading to different effects in combination than individually. While interfacing residue replacements on any one of the TCS components can easily be accommodated due to the loose character of the protein:protein association, epistatic substitutions in the same component and/or in the other partner, are called to play essential stabilizing or destabilizing compensatory roles. Epistatic substitutions are thus selected, such that partner recognition and non-cognate discrimination are maintained, but without leading to overstable, non-functional complexes."

HK:RR binding data in other TCSs are scarce, particularly exploring differential affinities according to the proteins\u2019 phosphorylation status.

When the pathway is turned off, HK autophosphorylation is inhibited by: 1) hindering CA domains mobility, holding ATP substrates far from the His<sub>188(HK)</sub> phosphorylation site; and, 2) DHp helical rotation, making the His<sub>188(HK)</sub> side chains inaccessible (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This \u2018open\u2019 autokinase-off configuration is linked to a folded N-terminal coiled-coil, in which DesK can bind P~DesR and trigger phosphatase catalysis. Linked to P~DesR phosphate lid opening, Asp<sub>189(HK)</sub> binds to Arg<sub>84(RR)</sub>, and Phe<sub>82(RR)</sub> becomes inserted into a DHp pocket (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Phe<sub>82(RR)</sub> is thus removed from the closed position, which would otherwise clash with an incoming nucleophilic water molecule (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">3</a>) that brings about dephosphorylation (Pazy et al., 2010). DesK Gln<sub>193(HK)</sub> is well located to position the catalytic water to perform dephosphorylation, consistent with the essential role of the homologous Gln residues in the phosphatase reactions mediated by the phosphatase CheZ (<a href=\"#bib88\">Zhao et al., 2002</a>) or by the HK NarX (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huynh et al., 2010</a>). The rotational movement of His<sub>188(HK)</sub>, placing it at\u00a0&gt;18 \u00c5 away from the reactive Asp<sub>54(RR)</sub>, makes phosphoryl back-transfer P~DesR\u2192DesK impossible (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Although sequence divergence makes the\u00a0DHp rotational shift unlikely in HisKA HKs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Marina et al., 2005</a>), DHp kinking by means of a conserved proline (<a href=\"#bib13\">Casino et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Mechaly et al., 2014</a>) could regulate the separation of the phosphorylatable His from the reaction center, analogously to the HisKA_3 rotational switch. Additional mechanisms that stabilize an \u2018open\u2019 state of HisKA HKs via extensive CA-DHp interfaces, have been reported to favor the phosphatase reaction (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dubey et al., 2016</a>) further supporting our hypotheses."

Such H-bond enhances His N\u03b52 nucleophilicity (<a href=\"#bib63\">Quezada et al., 2005</a>), and indeed a carboxylate at His\u00a0+\u00a01 is critical for autophosphorylation in a number of HKs (<a href=\"#bib83\">Willett and Kirby, 2012</a>).

The \u03b24\u03b14 loop in DesR plays a key role in these controls, remodeling its configuration in concert with DesK-association. This loop, acting as a phosphate lid, is open in the phosphotransferase complex, enabling the transfer reaction (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Yet, the phosphate lid is expected to close in, following the phosphoryl migration during transfer, due to the strong phosphoryl-Thr<sub>80(RR)</sub> interaction.

The energies of P-N and P-O bonds engaged in phosphoryl-transfer reactions among histidine and aspartate, appear to be equivalent, explaining a few known reversible systems (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burbulys et al., 1991</a>). However, and except for such systems where P~Asp\u2192His phosphorylation has been selected (such as in phosphorelays), phosphoryl back-transfer (P~RR\u2192HK) is typically minimized. Alternative sources of reactional asymmetry, other than bonding energetics, must be at play. Taking into account that phosphotransfer is a nucleophilic substitution at phosphorus, the reaction coordinate distance (i.e. between phosphorus and the entering atom, before the transfer reaction has begun) strongly suggests that P~DesK\u2192DesR phosphotransfer occurs through a largely dissociative, or \u2018loose\u2019 mechanism (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lassila et al., 2011</a>): a reaction coordinate distance of\u00a0\u22654.9 \u00c5 provides room for a fully dissociated metaphosphate intermediate (<a href=\"#bib51\">Mildvan, 1997</a>). This distance is directly correlated with the one separating side chain N and O atoms, respectively on the reactive His and Asp residues. Considering van der Waals radii, full dissociation of the phosphate intermediate is predicted for N-O distances of\u00a0\u22656.6 \u00c5. This threshold distance classifying phosphotransfer reactions into loose <i>vs</i> tight nucleophilic substitutions, nicely discriminates signaling complexes involved in, respectively, phosphorylations from the histidine imidazole group, or towards it (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#tbl6\">Table 6</a>). The His-Asp distance thus correlates with associative <i>vs</i> dissociative phosphotransfer, but also with the symmetry of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> cation with respect to the entering and leaving atoms (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>). Increased back-transfer has been observed when the cation is removed (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albanesi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lukat et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Shi et al., 1999</a>), further supporting that Mg<sup>2+</sup> asymmetry favors irreversible P~His\u2192Asp transfer reactions. Furthermore, mutations that likely increase the distance between TCS partners, without impeding their association, have been reported to affect differentially the forward- and back-transfer directions in otherwise reversible phosphoryl-transfer steps (<a href=\"#bib36\">Janiak-Spens et al., 2005</a>)."

Many, if not most, histidine kinases are bifunctional, capable of transferring phosphoryl groups to their cognate response regulator and stimulating their dephosphorylation. There are many unanswered questions about the mechanisms of the phosphotransfer and phosphatase reactions, in part because of the paucity of high-resolution structures of HK\u2022RR complexes. The manuscript by Tratjenberg et al. reports multiple DesK\u2022DesR structures and the reviewers all agreed that it will likely be regarded as a landmark study. In general, the manuscript is well written and illustrated, providing important new insights into (i) the mechanism for switching the HK between phosphotransfer and phosphatase reactions, (ii) a novel conformation of the RR when complexed with the HK, (iii) key roles of variable RR residues in the reactions, (iv) a dissociative phosphotransfer reaction mechanism, and (v) the apparent lack of participation of the conserved His on the HK in the phosphatase reaction."

The authors eventually make a reasonable case that the structures are what they are interpreted to be. However, the text first asserts that the structures represent the two reactions and then discusses some properties of each structure before explaining why the authors believe the structures represent the two reactions. It would be much more convincing to the reader to first provide the reasons why the authors believe their structures represent the phosphotransfer and dephosphorylation reactions and then describe the structures."

For example, the authors claim that DesKCSTAB is a phosphatase-constitutive mutant. This is true in the sense that the phosphatase activity of DesKCSTAB is (i) not regulated by temperature and (ii) comparable to the high temperature value exhibited by wild type DesKC. However, the actual phosphatase activity reported in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> of Saita et al. 2015 is quite weak. When mixed with DesR-P in equimolar amounts, DesKCSTAB was able to dephosphorylate only half of the DesR-P, and did so at twice the initial rate of wild type DesKC. In other words, there is no evidence that one DesKCSTAB can act as an enzyme to dephosphorylate more than one DesR-P molecule."

It is worth noting that the structure used to represent the inactive state (4LE1) lacks not only a phosphoryl group analogue, but also the divalent metal ion necessary for phosphoryl group chemistry. There are some differences in structures of receiver domains with or without metal ion bound, so the lack of a metal ion probably exaggerates the differences between the \"inactive\" state and the conformation observed in the complexes. It is perfectly appropriate to use 4LE1 when a metal bound structure is not available; however, it would be better to clearly alert the reader to the lack of metal ion."

However, in the phosphotransferase reaction the apo-RR should be recognized by P-HK, while the P-RR is recognized in the phosphatase reaction by the apo-HK. As is well know and the authors mentioned, the apo-RR and P-RR conformations are different. Therefore, the authors should analyze and discuss how are these conformations selectively recognized by the complementary HK conformation (structural determinants)."

In particular, the mechanism of phosphatase activity by HK remains unresolved and whether or not the conserved His residue participates in the reaction is controversial. For example, a recent prominent review article [Bhate, Structure 23, 981 (2015)] states that although the His is not always required, \"in cases where the catalytic histidine is required, it likely acts as a base to assist the attack of water or hydroxide on the phosphoryl-aspartyl group\".

I have two comments about the illustration and accompanying text:a) In subsection \u201cA HK:RR concerted switch controls efficiency along the signaling pathway\u201d the authors say that a hydrogen bond is formed between His188 and Asp189. Is this modeled in the reported structures or just speculation? The reference cited (Quezada et al. 2005) actually demonstrated hydrogen bonding between the conserved His and a Glu that is 22 residues to the C-terminal side, not 1 residue C-terminal as in DesK. It might be worth citing Willett &amp; Kirby, PLOS Genetics 8, e1-003984 (2012), which provides evidence in multiple HKs that the acidic residue at variable position H<sup>+</sup>1 is critical for autophosphorylation, but not for phosphatase activity.b) The proposed dissociative phosphotransfer mechanism involves a key interaction between the conserved Ser/Thr residue of the RR and the phosphoryl group that has been released from the HK, before attack by the RR Asp. One prediction of this mechanism might be that phosphotransfer from HK to RR would be severely affected in the absence of the conserved Ser/Thr residue. I am aware of only one potentially relevant piece of data in the literature. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> of Appleby &amp; Bourret, J Bacteriol 180, 3563 (1998) shows that phosphotransfer occurs from CheA to a CheY mutant in which the conserved Thr is repaced by an Ala. Obvious caveats are that CheAs are different than other HKs, and that the experiment was not particularly sensitive to changes in phosphotransfer rate (i.e. the rate of phosphotransfer could have been dramatically slower but still observed)."

For example, subsection \u201cThe phosphatase to phosphotransferase transition: reconfiguring the reaction center for catalysis\u201d notes apparent hydrogen bonding between the phosphoryl group and Thr81 of DesK. One wonders what happens in the ~80% of RRs for which the residue corresponding to Thr81 is not a Ser or Thr. Similarly, in this section and elsewhere, the role of Phe82 in forming the phosphate lid is noted. One wonders what happens in the 2/3 of response regulators that do not contain an aromatic residue (Tyr, Phe, His) at the position corresponding to Phe82. These are rich topics for future investigation.

Such a claim is supported mostly on two pieces of evidence: i-in vitromeasurements of CheY\u2019s Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity at neutral pH (Lukat el al 1990), which falls approximately within the same order of magnitude, sub-mM/low mM range, as that of free intra-cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in enterobacteria (Froschauer et al. 2004 FEMS Microbiol Lett 237:49; Alattosava et al. 1985 J Bac 162:413), and ii- \u201cdirect\u201d estimations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound CheY by <i>in cell</i> NMR methods (Hubbard et al. 2003 Mol Microbiol 49:1191), revealing signal peaks more similar to metallated than to non-metallated CheY species. However, it must be stressed, as the authors recognize in that Hubbard et al. paper, that these <i>in cell</i> NMR measurements were performed using cells that had overexpressed CheY to reach NMR-detection limits (~5 times higher concentrations of CheY than normal), which given a constant metal-binding affinity, and a tightly regulated intra-cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration, is expected to result in a ~5-fold overestimation of the complexed form (not to account for the undetermined proportion of phosphorylated vs unphosphorylated CheY variants under such overexpression regimes). Taking all this evidence together, it doesn\u2019t really seem sensible at this time to rule out the possibility of having significant amounts of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free CheY in <i>E. coli</i> cells, mostly so when cells have low free metal concentrations (1mM or lower)."

Working with <i>wt</i> proteins most often implies simultaneous phosphoryl-transfer and dephosphorylation, confusing clear-cut interpretations. With these caveats considered, only a few HK:RR interactions have been thoroughly characterized, which actually lend further support to our hypothesis. EnvZ binds OmpR and P~OmpR with equivalent affinities (Yoshida et al. 2002). The same holds for PhoQ binding PhoP or P~PhoP (Castelli et al., 2003). CheA has slightly lower affinity (but within the same order of magnitude) for P~CheY than for CheY (Schuster et al., 1993Nature 365:343; Li et al. 1995 Biochemistry 34:14626). And, this 2- to 3-fold difference cannot be immediately interpreted in terms of potential CheA:CheY interface differences, to be directly compared to our data. Most importantly because, besides CheA\u2019s P1 domain (containing the phosphorylatable His, hence certainly contacting CheY), CheA bears an additional P2 domain, which is a CheY-binding element not present in most HKs including DesK. Given that CheA-P2 binds to a surface on CheY [Welch et al. 1998 Nat Struct Biol 5:25] that is known to change according to CheY\u2019s phosphorylation state (the \u03b14\u03b25\u03b15 surface, which is the same surface that later binds FliM during downstream output response), it would not be surprising that CheA:CheY <i>vs</i> CheA:P~CheYbinding affinities change driven by CheA-P2:CheY binding modulation. Added to this, we still don\u2019t know whether P~CheA binds to CheY with a significantly different affinity as apo-CheA does (our data predict those association constants to be similar, further studies needed to prove it)."

We are tempted to speculate that when the signaling pathway turns the HK off, at first large amounts of P~RR are present, such that the HK in its phosphatase state catalyzes P~RR dephosphorylation. At some point though, enough amount of apo-RR builds, competing with P~RR for HK binding. This could result in a biphasic HK-mediated P~RR dephosphorylation slope (an example of product inhibition), and the RR\u2019s autodephosphorylation capacity could become increasingly relevant (as well as additional dedicated phosphatases such as CheZ, RapH, etc, if present). Such biphasic behavior might be a better interpretation of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> of Saita et al., 2015 Mol Microbiol 98:258 (already mentioned above in response to comment #2). A further derivation of this is that fairly stable complexes of HK:RR (with neither partner phosphorylated) cannot be excluded, perhaps playing biologically relevant roles. The low nanomolar affinity (~30nM) measured for CheA:CheY supports this notion (Schuster et al., 1993Nature 365:343), as the authors explicitly mention."

Is this modeled in the reported structures or just speculation? The reference cited (Quezada et al. 2005) actually demonstrated hydrogen bonding between the conserved His and a Glu that is 22 residues to the C-terminal side, not 1 residue C-terminal as in DesK. It might be worth citing Willett &amp; Kirby, PLOS Genetics 8, e1-003984 (2012), which provides evidence in multiple HKs that the acidic residue at variable position H<sup>+</sup>1 is critical for autophosphorylation, but not for phosphatase activity.</i>"

The Quezada et al. 2005 article is referenced there, because even when the carboxylate group in that case (CheA) is indeed coming from a completely different place (compared to the more canonical DHp-containing HKs), it is a very nice paper where direct NMR spectroscopy data reveal how that carboxylate H-bond stabilizes the reactive protonation tautomer of the reactive His during autophosphorylation."

I am aware of only one potentially relevant piece of data in the literature. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> of Appleby &amp; Bourret, J Bacteriol 180, 3563 (1998) shows that phosphotransfer occurs from CheA to a CheY mutant in which the conserved Thr is repaced by an Ala.

Although both Ganguli and Gautam articles detect HK-mediated phosphotransfer activity in vitro, using a Thr-to-Ala substituted RR, they do report a significant decrease in such transfers. All these papers, including Appleby &amp; Bourret, observe substantial perturbations and even disruption of in vivosignaling when this Thr is substituted (and, consistently, Thr-to-Ser giving milder or undetectable deleterious effects). Taking those pieces of evidence together, it seems that this Thr is not a catalytic residue <i>sensu strictu</i> (i.e. one that directly participates in the chemistry within the reaction center, such that its substitution results in a drop of reaction velocity of several orders of magnitude, in practical terms usually to undetectable limits for in vitroenzymatic assays), but one that plays a major role in the reaction, detectable in vitro, and to the point of precluding normal biological function."

At this point, taking now into account the crystallographic evidence that we are reporting, it is tempting to speculate that Thr80 might play an increasingly essential role in phosphoryl-transfer, correlated to the increasing degree of dissociative character of such reaction for a given TCS pair."

But, for TCS complexes where that His(HK)-to-Asp(RR) distance is large, such as in DesK:DesR and others, nucleophilic substitution chemistry predicts a non-negligible amount of free metaphosphate intermediate for the reaction to occur, and it is in this case where the conserved Thr is expected to play a more essential role (again, maybe not catalytic <i>sensu strictu</i>, but without which the velocity could be reduced substantially because of insufficient intermediate state stabilization \u2013 the limit of catalytic vs non catalytic becoming of course increasingly ambiguous)."

One wonders what happens in the 2/3 of response regulators that do not contain an aromatic residue (Tyr, Phe, His) at the position corresponding to Phe82.
