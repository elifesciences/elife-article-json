We use coarse-grained simulations to investigate the Sec-facilitated membrane integration of EmrE and its mutants on realistic biological timescales. This work reveals a mechanism for regulating membrane-protein topogenesis, in which initially misintegrated configurations of the proteins undergo post-translational annealing to reach fully integrated multispanning topologies. The energetic barriers associated with this post-translational annealing process enforce kinetic pathways that dictate the topology of the fully integrated proteins. The proposed mechanism agrees well with the experimentally observed features of EmrE topogenesis and provides a range of experimentally testable predictions regarding the effect of translocon mutations on membrane protein topogenesis."

Performing these roles requires integration of the IMPs into the membrane with the correct topology (i.e., the correct orientation of the fully integrated IMP relative to the membrane). In most cases, membrane integration proceeds via the Sec translocon, a conserved protein-conducting channel located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes or in the plasma membrane in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib51\">White and von Heijne, 2004</a>). During this process, the ribosome or other molecular motor docks to the cytoplasmic opening of the translocon, feeding the nascent protein into the translocon channel (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shao and Hegde, 2011</a>); conformational changes in the lateral gate (LG) helices of the translocon then allow sufficiently hydrophobic segments of the nascent protein to integrate as transmembrane domains (TMD) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hessa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Egea and Stroud, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhang and Miller, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gogala et al., 2014</a>). The orientation of a single TMD relative to the membrane is determined by factors that include the hydrophobicity of the TMD and the charge and length of the soluble loops that flank the TMD (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goder and Spiess, 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Devaraneni et al., 2011</a>).

In this cotranslational model, the dominant IMP topology is determined by the orientation of the N-terminal TMD and is primarily dictated by the features of that leading TMD (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hartmann et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Borel and Simon, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dale et al., 2000</a>). However, the cotranslational model is challenged by dual-topology proteins, which exhibit both possible orientations of the fully integrated IMP with respect to the membrane in approximately 1:1 stoichiometry (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rapp et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2007</a>). The most thoroughly studied dual-topology protein is the bacterial multidrug transporter EmrE (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>), which can be biased in favor of a single dominant topology by introducing positive charges to any of its soluble loops (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rapp et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2010</a>). The dominant topology of each EmrE mutant retains the loop with the additional positive charges in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2010</a>), apparently satisfying the empirical trend known as the \u2018positive-inside\u2019 rule which notes that the combined charges of the cytoplasmic loops (i.e., K+R bias) of an IMP correlates with its dominant topology (<a href=\"#bib49\">von Heijne, 1986</a>). Surprisingly, adding charges to even C-terminal loops can influence the dominant topology of EmrE, suggesting that such mutations have a long-range effect on the orientation of previously-translated TMDs. This finding is inconsistent with the cotranslational model and raises interesting questions about IMP topogenesis. At what point is IMP topology established with respect to ribosomal translation? Are TMD orientations locked-in during the period in which the nascent IMP is attached to the ribosome (i.e., cotranslationally) or do TMD orientations remain subject to change even upon completion of ribosomal translation (i.e., post-translationally)?"

We use a coarse-grained (CG) model that enables access to a timescale of minutes while retaining sufficient chemical accuracy to capture the forces that drive membrane integration (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</a>). The distribution of topologies predicted by the simulations are in good agreement with previous experimental findings (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rapp et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2010</a>). The simulation results show that TMDs in the dual-topology mutants do not completely integrate by the end of translation; instead, the slow post-translational flipping of loops across the membrane allows misintegrated TMDs to reorient and insert into the membrane. The fully integrated topology is determined by the position of the loop that undergoes flipping most slowly. This work elucidates the mechanism by which dual-topology protein topology is established, reconciles dominant protein topologies with the positive-inside rule, and predicts the role that the translocon plays in mediating multispanning IMP topogenesis. Other examples of post-translational topological changes in diverse multispanning IMP systems suggest that this mechanism may have generality beyond EmrE (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lambert and Prange, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kanki et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Skach, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">\u00d6jemalm et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bowie, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Virkki et al., 2014</a>)."

The ribosome, translocon, and nascent protein are all composed of CG beads. Each bead has a diameter of <i>\u03c3</i> = 0.8 nm to represent approximately three amino-acid residues. This bead diameter is similar to the Kuhn length of polypeptides (<a href=\"#bib45\">Staple et al., 2008</a>) so that the nascent protein can be treated as a freely jointed chain. The surrounding solvent and lipid bilayer are included implicitly, a technique that is used in other CG models of the translocon (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rychkova and Warshel, 2013</a>). The time-evolution of nascent protein configurations is calculated using Brownian dynamics with a 100 ns timestep. The kinetics of the LG are modeled as stochastic transitions between a closed conformation, which prevents the nascent protein from exiting from the channel interior to the membrane, and an open conformation, which removes the barrier to membrane entry. All bead positions are projected onto the plane that passes along the translocon channel axis between the helices forming the LG. This off-lattice 2D approximation reflects the cylindrical geometry of the channel and is inspired by previous models of biopolymer translocation through nanopores (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huopaniemi et al., 2006</a>). Beads representing the ribosome enclosure and translocon are placed to approximate their structures (<a href=\"#bib46\">Van den Berg et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Frauenfeld et al., 2011</a>). Two negative charges are placed on a bead at the cytosolic end of the translocon LG, whereas two positive charges are placed on a bead at the periplasmic end of the translocon LG. This charge distribution reflects the position of conserved charged residues (<a href=\"#bib51\">White and von Heijne, 2004</a>) near the translocon LG that have been previously shown to affect single-spanning protein topogenesis (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goder et al., 2004</a>).

Moreover, the model has been shown to accurately predict features of single-spanning IMP integration and topogenesis (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</a>), including the sigmoidal dependence of stop-transfer efficiency on TMD hydrophobicity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hessa et al., 2005</a>), the inversion of signal-anchor orientation during translation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goder and Spiess, 2003</a>), and the effect of translation rates and sequence features on signal-anchor orientation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goder and Spiess, 2003</a>). In particular, the model has been shown (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</a>) to correctly describe integration processes that are governed either by thermodynamics (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hessa et al., 2005</a>) or kinetics (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goder and Spiess, 2003</a>), and it has provided a means of understanding the competition between such effects. The model has also been shown to correctly predict the dominant topology for a three-TMD multispanning IMP with a strong positive-inside bias (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</a>). The strong agreement between simulation and experimental results presented in this work further indicates that IMP topological determinants are captured at this CG resolution."

The CG beads assume one of four types as determined by the associated amino-acid residues in the nascent protein; these CG bead-types include V (moderately hydrophobic), L (very hydrophobic), Q (neutral-hydrophilic), and K (positively charged). Among these types, the CG beads vary with respect to their charge and their water/membrane transfer free energies (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Appendix table 1</a>). In the hydropathy profile, the N-terminal TMD (TMD1) is less hydrophobic than the other three TMDs, so its beads are assigned the V bead type. All other TMD beads are assigned the L bead type. Beads in each soluble loop are assigned to either the K or Q bead type, depending on the location of positive charges in the amino-acid sequence; positive charges are highlighted in red in the EmrE wild-type amino-acid sequence in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Each K bead type is assigned a +2 charge, following previous work (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</a>). Negative charges are excluded from the CG representation of EmrE, because EmrE exhibits a small number of such charges (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and because the experimentally studied EmrE mutations focus only on the addition/removal of positively charged residues (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2010</a>). Nonetheless, the effect of negatively charged residues in the CG simulation was explicitly tested in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and was found to be minor.

Specifically, it is assumed that upon reaching configurations in which all of the TMDs are integrated into the membrane, the protein topology remains irreversibly fixed for all subsequent times; physical processes that may lead to this irreversibility include the dimerization of EmrE proteins to form functional channels in the membrane (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lloris-Garcer\u00e1 et al., 2012</a>) or the degradation of undimerized EmrE proteins prior to topological inversion (<a href=\"#bib53\">Woodall et al., 2015</a>). Given the symmetry of the membrane-protein interactions in the absence of the translocon, if the CG trajectories were allowed to run for infinitely long times to reach full equilibration after diffusing away from the translocon, the relative probability of the N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> and N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>peri</sub> topologies would be equal, regardless of the protein sequence. The employed trajectory termination criteria thus isolate the role of the non-equilibrium integration process in determining IMP topology. Demonstration of the robustness of the reported results to the cutoff values employed in the trajectory termination criteria are provided in the <i>Robustness checks for the trajectory termination criteria</i> section of the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019."

TMDs in the CB mutant integrate sequentially with near 100% efficiency during translation, which is consistent with the standard cotranslational model of topogenesis (c.f. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and explains the rapid timescale for fully integrating into a multispanning topology shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. In contrast, the TMDs of EmrE exhibit only partial integration, even at long times following the completion of translation. Snapshots of a typical misintegrated TMD in EmrE are shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>. Various experiments have indicated that such configurations with misintegrated TMDs arise due to frustration from charges placed in consecutive loops (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gafvelin and von Heijne, 1994</a>), the strong orientational preference of a neighboring TMD (<a href=\"#bib34\">\u00d6jemalm et al., 2012</a>), or the weak stop-transfer efficiency of marginally hydrophobic TMDs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Moss et al., 1998</a>).

This mechanism, which we refer to as kinetic annealing of the end-of-translation (EOT) ensemble, is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and involves two basic steps. In the first step, the cotranslational integration (or misintegration) of each TMD leads to an ensemble of IMP configurations associated with the time at which ribosomal translation completes; we call this set of configurations the EOT ensemble. In the second step of the proposed mechanism, configurations in the EOT ensemble anneal toward a fully integrated topology as a function of time as loops post-translationally flip across the membrane. The rate at which the soluble loops undergo post-translational flipping is a key determinant of the fully integrated topology. We will show that this mechanism explains the unexpected elements of EmrE topogenesis observed experimentally, including the topogenic effect of C-terminal mutations (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2010</a>)."

Differences in loop charges in the various mutants leads to variation in the corresponding EOT ensembles, because electrostatic interactions between highly-charged loops and the translocon favor their cytoplasmic retention (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goder et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</a>). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> shows representative members of the EOT ensemble for the EmrE, T28R, and nR111 mutants with the most-charged loop of each mutant highlighted in red. The EOT ensemble is defined as the set of configurations visited by a given nascent protein within 1 s of simulation time following the termination of ribosomal translation. The schematics indicate how various TMDs integrate or misintegrate to give rise to heterogeneity in the EOT ensemble of configurations, while the loops with added charges preferentially obtain cytoplasmic positions. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> further quantifies the cytoplasmic bias of charged loops by showing the EOT ensemble averaged loop positions with respect to the membrane for all five loops in each mutant, expressed as the fraction of EOT configurations with a given loop in the cytoplasm. The increased cytoplasmic localization exhibited by the L2 and L5 loops in T28R and nR111 respectively highlights the effect of adding positive charges. Similarly, the reduced cytoplasmic retention of L2 and L4 in nR111 relative to EmrE is due to the removal of charges from these loops."

For each of the three mutants, the figure schematically illustrates the post-translational kinetics of two representative configurations from the EOT ensemble. Black horizontal arrows indicate how the flipping of soluble loops across the membrane leads to transitions between intermediate configurations. The most-charged loop is again highlighted in red. Each configuration post-translationally anneals toward a fully integrated topology as loops stochastically flip across the membrane to correct the misintegrated TMDs. The soluble loops undergo flipping at different rates, with charged loops flipping more slowly. The slowest-flipping loop thus determines the fully integrated topology that is most kinetically-accessible from a given configuration in the EOT ensemble, because the other loops will more rapidly flip. The EmrE examples (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, left) demonstrate how the equal distribution of L2 positions with respect to the membrane in the EOT ensemble leads to two different fully integrated topologies, giving rise to the dual-topology behavior. The T28R examples (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, right) show that increasing the charge of L2, thereby biasing its cytoplasmic localization in the EOT ensemble (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), leads to a dominant N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>peri</sub> topology. Finally, the nR111 examples illustrate how C-terminal charges can have a long-range topogenic effect by biasing the fully integrated proteins towards a dominant N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> topology."

The energetic cost for flipping a hydrophilic loop across the hydrophobic membrane increases with the hydrophilicity of the loop; the loop-flipping frequency observed during simulations is thus expected to decrease for loops with larger numbers of charges. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> shows the computed loop-flipping frequencies for each loop in the EmrE mutants. In this analysis, loop-flipping events are determined by comparing loop positions with respect to the membrane in 1-ms time intervals, as described in the <i>Calculation of loop-flipping frequency</i> section of the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. The number of charges in each loop are marked with dots. As expected, highly-charged loops exhibit a decreased loop-flipping frequency. The figure also reveals that the terminal L1 and L5 loops have a lower loop-flipping frequency than the intermediate L2-4 loops. Loop-flipping events are not found to be strongly concerted, as two or more loops were observed to flip concurrently in only 0.015% of all 1-ms time intervals in which at least one loop-flipping event was observed. However, the loop-flipping frequency of a given loop is impacted by the orientation of its neighboring TMDs; on average, a loop with a single misintegrated neighboring TMD flips 1.5 times more frequently than the same loop with zero misintegrated neighboring TMDs, while a loop with two misintegrated TMDs flips 3.7 times more frequently than the same loop with zero misintegrated neighboring TMDs. Additional details on these calculations are presented in the <i>Calculation of loop-flipping frequency</i> section of the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019."

Several bacterial proteases that degrade membrane proteins have been characterized which provides insight into the approximate degradation timescale (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dalbey et al., 2011</a>). For example, FtsH is a membrane-embedded protease that degrades misassembled IMPs over timescales ranging from 2 min (for SecY) to 15 min (for YccA) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ito and Akiyama, 2005</a>), and even longer timescales for degradation have been observed in eukaryotic systems (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buck and Skach, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Feige and Hendershot, 2013</a>); very recently, FtsH was also shown to degrade undimerized EmrE on a sub-30 min timescale (<a href=\"#bib53\">Woodall et al., 2015</a>). In comparison to the simulated trajectories (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), these degradation timescales are relatively slow, supporting the assumption that IMP integration and post-translational annealing reaches completion prior to significant degradation. Nonetheless, if degradation of EmrE occurs on faster timescales, it could potentially impact the reported topologies from the simulations. To investigate this effect, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> shows the relative fraction of N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> and N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>peri</sub> protein topologies for the CG trajectories that have reached fully integrated topologies as a function of time, excluding all trajectories for which at least one TMD is misintegrated. If it is assumed that fully integrated proteins are resistant to degradation (or that rapid dimerization following the full integration of EmrE protects the proteins from degradation [<a href=\"#bib53\">Woodall et al., 2015</a>]), then each point in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> represents the distribution of topologies that would be observed if all misfolded proteins were uniformly degraded at the corresponding time. Data are shown for degradation times ranging from 5 s to 100 s following the end of translation; the dashed lines indicate the overall fraction of N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> topologies for each mutant after all CG trajectories reach fully integrated topologies, corresponding to the results from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> shows that the distribution of topologies is nearly constant with respect to degradation time, preserving the correlation between the position of the slowest-flipping loop at the end of translation and in the fully integrated topology. These results suggest that the predicted distribution of protein topologies from simulation is relatively robust with respect to possible degradation processes that occur on the same timescale as post-translational annealing."

Introducing charge mutations to the soluble loops of a multispanning IMP leads to shifts in both the distribution of loop positions in the EOT ensemble (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and changes in the kinetics of loop-flipping events that lead to the fully integrated topologies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The combination of these effects is found to govern the observed distribution of fully integrated topologies in the CG simulations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This proposed mechanism explains the experimental finding that adding charges to any of the soluble loops of EmrE, even a loop near the C-terminus, affects the observed topology (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2010</a>). The proposed mechanism also agrees with recent experiments that find EmrE to undergo partial topological rearrangements that correspond to the loop-flipping events described here (<a href=\"#bib53\">Woodall et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, the mechanism can explain deviations from the positive-inside rule if the position of the slowest-flipping loop in the EOT ensemble enforces a topology in which the majority of the positive charges are in periplasmic loops, as seen for the K3 mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

A simple overarching prediction of the mechanism is that changes to the ribosome or translocon that affect the EOT ensemble may lead to significant shifts in topology. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> shows the average position of the slowest-flipping loop in the EOT ensemble after slowing translation from 24 residues/s to 6 residues/s to model the addition of cycloheximide (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goder and Spiess, 2003</a>), removing the periplasmic positive charge from the channel, or removing the cytoplasmic negative charge from the channel (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goder et al., 2004</a>). For single-spanning IMPs, the rate of translation and the removal of translocon charges were previously found to significantly affect TMD orientation in both simulations and experiments (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goder and Spiess, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Goder et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</a>). We find that slowing translation has a minimal effect on the mutants studied here, and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a> confirms this finding for other translation rates. Given that these EOT loop positions are unchanged, and given that the post-translational dynamics is unaffected by the ribosomal translation rate, these results suggest that changing translation rate will not affect the final distribution of fully integrated topologies. In contrast, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> shows that removing either the cytoplasmic or periplasmic charge on the translocon significantly decreases the cytoplasmic retention of the slowest-flipping loops by increasing the periplasmic accessibility of highly charged loops. Most notably, it is found that for two of the EmrE mutants (indicated in dashed boxes) the translocon charge mutations dramatically shift the slowest-flipping loop position in the EOT ensemble from being primarily cytosolic to being primarily periplasmic, suggesting that the dominant topology for these EmrE mutants will be similarly reversed by the translocon charge mutations. These changes in IMP topology due to channel mutations are experimentally testable predictions of the proposed mechanism."

In the CG model, neglecting interactions with the Sec translocon, both the N<sub>cyto</sub>/C<sub>cyto</sub> or N<sub>peri</sub>/C<sub>peri</sub> topologies are energetically equivalent and would be observed with equal probability if simulations were continued for an infinitely long time. The prediction of a dominant topology by the CG model arises from the initial distribution of configurations in the EOT ensemble (due to interactions of the nascent protein with the translocon complex) and from the available kinetic pathways that allow the configurations in the EOT ensemble to reach fully integrated topologies. We note that the changes in topology predicted in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> would be unexpected from a model in which the dominant topology of an IMP is determined by thermodynamic equilibration, since the equilibrium distribution of the protein topologies would be unaffected by transient interactions with the translocon or ribosome during initial membrane integration."

In addition to demonstrating excellent agreement with the experimentally observed topologies of EmrE and its mutants (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2010</a>), the simulations reveal a novel mechanism for the regulation of topogenesis in multi-spanning membrane proteins, in which initially misintegrated configurations of the proteins undergo post-translational annealing to reach final, fully integrated topologies. The energetic barriers associated with this post-translational annealing process enforce kinetic pathways that dictate the topology of the fully integrated proteins. The inclusion of charged residues on the soluble loops of the IMP can lead to significant changes in the distribution of fully integrated topologies by both altering the ensemble of protein configurations at the end of ribosomal translation, as well as by altering the available kinetic pathways that lead to fully integrated topologies."

For EmrE and its mutants, we find that a significant fraction of the IMP configurations are misintegrated upon completion of ribosomal translation and undergo subsequent post-translational annealing to reach fully integrated topologies. In contrast, a CB mutant exhibits an essentially fully integrated ensemble of configurations at the time that ribosomal translation completes. For other IMPs, a combination of these behaviors may well be expected (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lambert and Prange, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kanki et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Skach, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">\u00d6jemalm et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bowie, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Virkki et al., 2014</a>), with some fraction of the nascent protein configurations reaching fully integrated topologies at the completion of ribosomal translation and some fraction reaching misintegrated configurations that subsequently undergo post-translational annealing.

EtBr is toxic to <i>E. coli</i>, but antiparallel EmrE dimers, in which the two monomers forming the dimer have opposite topologies, confer drug resistance. EmrE dimerization can also be suppressed by including an E14D mutation. The topology of an EmrE variant with the E14D mutation can thus be inferred by coexpressing the mutant with another EmrE variant of known topology, as any resulting drug resistance (and cell growth) can be attributed to the formation of antiparallel dimers.

In the \u2018in-out\u2019 pathway, the TMD fully spans the channel prior to membrane integration; a trajectory thus exhibits this pathway if a TMD visits IS3 on the way to membrane integration without visiting IS4."

It is clear that the dominant cotranslational integration pathway for all four TMDs in both the EmrE and nEmrE mutants is the \u2018channel-sliding\u2019 pathway. This same pathway was also observed in the previous study of single-spanning proteins using the CG model (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang and Miller, 2012a</a>) and similar configurations were observed in long-timescale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the early stages of cotranslational membrane integration (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zhang and Miller, 2012b</a>). We find that only a small number of CG trajectories exhibit the \u2018interface-sliding\u2019 pathway. Finally, we note that the dominant cotranslational integration pathway is likely to depend on the IMP sequence, and the \u2018channel-sliding\u2019 behavior may be less dominant in other IMPs with less hydrophobic TMDs."

Consistent with experiment, the simulations produce a mixture of orientations of the protein in the membrane that is sensitive to mutations in the loops connecting the transmembrane helices. Transient topologies are found to anneal by flipping loops across the membrane during post-translational annealing. The resulting orientation distribution thus depends strongly on the electrostatic character of these loops. This work sheds light on the mechanism of membrane protein insertion, its kinetics, and the factors determining the orientation and its variability."

This is important, because Cymer et al.
