During Arabidopsis development, the intercellular movement of SHORTROOT (SHR) and subsequent interaction with its downstream target SCARECROW (SCR) control root patterning and cell fate specification. However, quantitative information about the spatio-temporal dynamics of SHR movement and SHR-SCR interaction is currently unavailable. Here, we quantify parameters including SHR mobility, oligomeric state, and association with SCR using a combination of Fluorescent Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) techniques. We then incorporate these parameters into a mathematical model of SHR and SCR, which shows that SHR reaches a steady state in minutes, while SCR and the SHR-SCR complex reach a steady-state between 18 and 24\u2009hr. Our model reveals the timing of SHR and SCR dynamics and allows us to understand how protein movement and protein-protein stoichiometry contribute to development."

During Arabidopsis development, the intercellular movement of SHORTROOT (SHR) and subsequent interaction with its downstream target SCARECROW (SCR) control root patterning and cell fate specification. However, quantitative information about the spatio-temporal dynamics of SHR movement and SHR-SCR interaction is currently unavailable. Here, we quantify parameters including SHR mobility, oligomeric state, and association with SCR using a combination of Fluorescent Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) techniques. We then incorporate these parameters into a mathematical model of SHR and SCR, which shows that SHR reaches a steady state in minutes, while SCR and the SHR-SCR complex reach a steady-state between 18 and 24\u2009hr. Our model reveals the timing of SHR and SCR dynamics and allows us to understand how protein movement and protein-protein stoichiometry contribute to development."

In plants that had lower levels of SCARECROW, SHORTROOT moves between cells more quickly and in an unrestricted manner. This suggests that SCARECROW forms a complex with SHORTROOT to restrict its movement in the endodermis. The experiments also show that SHORTROOT is only able to leave the endodermis to return to the vasculature when SCARECROW levels are lower than normal."

In the <i>Arabidopsis</i> root, the SHORTROOT-SCARECROW (SHR-SCR) mediated gene regulatory network (GRN) is a well-characterized developmental pathway that controls ground tissue patterning and endodermal cell fate specification (<a href=\"#bib26\">Levesque et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cui et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sozzani et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cruz-Ram\u0131rez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Long et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Moreno-Risueno et al., 2015</a>).

Thus, we explored the possibility of combining scanning Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (scanning FCS) techniques. Unlike more common time correlation FCS techniques, which only use temporal information, scanning FCS techniques utilizes both the spatial and temporal information present in a confocal raster scan to measure protein movement, protein-protein interactions, and the stoichiometry of protein complexes. (<a href=\"#bib32\">Petrasek and Schwille, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Digman and Gratton, 2011</a>). Previously, these techniques have only been used to quantify protein mobility and the dynamics of protein association in cell cultures (<a href=\"#bib5\">Digman et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Digman and Gratton, 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Digman et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jameson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rossow et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hinde et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Vetri et al., 2011</a>). We combined the techniques of Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS), Pair Correlation Function (pCF) and Number and Brightness (N&amp;B;) to analyze SHR and SCR mobility and interaction at high spatio-temporal resolution. By using RICS and pCF (<a href=\"#bib5\">Digman et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Brown et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Digman and Gratton, 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jameson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rossow et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hinde et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Vetri et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Digman and Gratton, 2011</a>), we quantified the rate and directionality of SHR movement. Specifically, we used RICS and a 3D Gaussian diffusion model (<a href=\"#bib5\">Digman et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">2005b</a>) to calculate the diffusion coefficient of SHR in different root cell types. We also acquired line scans and performed pCF analyses (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hinde et al., 2010</a>) to assess the directionality of SHR movement in these different cell types. Moreover, we used N&amp;B; and cross-correlation analyses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Digman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">2009b</a>) to characterize the oligomeric state of SHR and the stoichiometry of the SHR-SCR complex, respectively. Finally, we incorporated the diffusion coefficient of SHR and the stoichiometry of the SHR-SCR complex into a mathematical model of SHR and SCR dynamics. Our results demonstrate that these parameters can be used in predictive mathematical models, allowing us to understand how protein movement and stoichiometry of protein complexes contribute to developmental processes. Further, our study highlights how these non-invasive scanning FCS techniques can be used to experimentally measure protein movement and protein-protein interactions within multicellular organisms."

In order to measure protein movement in a multicellular organism such as <i>Arabidopsis,</i> we used Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS), which returns an autocorrelation function (ACF) by correlating fluorescence intensity fluctuations in pixels in an image over time and space. The diffusion coefficient (DC) is then calculated by fitting the ACF with a diffusion model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Since the fit of the diffusion model depends on the choice of imaging parameters, such as pixel size and pixel dwell time, we first set these parameters by performing RICS analysis on Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) driven by the CaMV 35S constitutive promoter (35S:GFP) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, see Materials and methods). In the <i>Arabidopsis</i> root, the resulting DC for free GFP was 6.33 \u00b1 0.37 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s (<i>n\u00a0</i>=\u00a034 for different cells, including vascular, endodermal, and QC cells) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We obtained similar diffusion coefficients using two different confocal microscopes (Zeiss 780 and Zeiss 710)."

To this end, we used a SHR:SHR-GFP translational fusion, which complements the <i>shr2</i> mutant phenotype (SHR:SHR-GFP in <i>shr2</i>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nakajima et al., 2001</a>). Our RICS analysis showed that SHR moves at a rate of 2.45 \u00b1 0.26 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s (<i>n\u00a0=\u00a0</i>40) and 1.73 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s (n\u00a0=\u00a016) within a population of vascular and endodermal cells and vascular and QC cells, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Notably, in a population of only endodermal cells, SHR moves at a significantly slower rate (1.29 \u00b1 0.14 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s <i>n\u00a0=\u00a0</i>19, Wilcoxon with Steel-Dwass, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0303) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). To investigate whether the reduction in SHR movement in the endodermis may be due to its interaction SCR (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cui et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Levesque et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sozzani et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Moreno-Risueno et al., 2015</a>), we measured the DC of SHR in a SCR RNAi (SCRi) line (SHR:SHR-GFP in SCRi)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Cui et al., 2007</a>). In this line, in which the levels of SCR are reduced, SHR diffusion in populations of only endodermal cells was similar to that in populations of vascular and endodermal cells (2.40 \u00b1 0.29 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s, <i>n\u00a0=\u00a0</i>14, Wilcoxon with Steel-Dwass, p\u00a0=\u00a00.9337)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Overall, our RICS data are in agreement with genetic and molecular data that show SHR movement is restricted by SCR (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heidstra et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cui et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Long et al., 2015</a>). Most importantly, our RICS data provide a precise quantification of how SHR diffusion is affected by the presence of SCR."

                                "text": "An open question is whether SHR moves unidirectionally, only from the inner to the outer cell layers, or in a bidirectional fashion. The former would be consistent with an active transport mechanism from the vasculature into the endodermis. To detect the route of intercellular movement of SHR between the vasculature and endodermis as well as between the endodermis and cortex, we used pair correlation function (pCF) analysis on line scans (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We used pCF to measure the directionality of movement by correlating pixels that are separated by a specific pixel distance (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hinde and Cardarelli, 2011</a>). To account for differences in cell size, as well as cell wall orientation within our images, we used three different distances: 5 pixels, 7 pixels, and 9 pixels. Generally, the pCF analysis returns a carpet, or heatmap, that shows the fluorescence correlation over time (y-axis) and space (x-axis). If proteins move across the cell wall, there is an arch that represents the delay in movement. If proteins are unable to cross the barrier, the arch is absent (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hinde et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) (see Materials and methods). Thus, we performed a binary analysis on each carpet to determine the movement of SHR between cells by looking at the presence, or absence, of these arches. Specifically, we recorded a 1 if the carpet showed an arch and a 0 if no arch was present (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We took the average of these values from the different pixel distances (5, 7, and 9) to represent one biological replicate. We then calculated the protein Movement Index (MI), which is the average of all biological replicates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). As a positive control, we acquired pCF data for 35SGFP, which had a MI\u00a0=\u00a00.71 \u00b1 0.07 (n\u00a0=\u00a015). As a negative control we used 3xGFP, which was shown to restrict free GFP movement in roots (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2005</a>). To this end, we drove the 3xGFP using a root vasculature promoter (TMO5:3xGFP, <a href=\"#bib42\">Schlereth et al., 2010</a>) which had a MI\u00a0= 0.26 \u00b1 0.05 (n\u00a0=\u00a019) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We found that SHR moves from the vasculature to the endodermis (MI\u00a0= 0.58 \u00b1 0.03, n\u00a0=\u00a020, Wilcoxon with Steel-Dwass, p\u00a0=\u00a00.6356), consistent with previous experimental data (<a href=\"#bib19\">Helariutta et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Nakajima et al., 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). However, from the endodermis back to the vasculature, the MI of SHR was significantly lower than the MI of free GFP (MI\u00a0= 0.36 \u00b1 0.07, n\u00a0=\u00a020, Wilcoxon with Steel-Dwass, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0368) and not significantly different from the MI of the 3xGFP (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.5974), suggesting that SHR is unable to move back to the vasculature (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In addition, we found that SHR moves bidirectionally between the endodermis and cortex, as the MI is not significantly different from that of free GFP (MI\u00a0= 0.61 \u00b1 0.06 from endodermis to cortex, MI = 0.53 \u00b1 0.06 from cortex to endodermis, n\u00a0=\u00a020, Wilcoxon with Steel-Dwass, p\u00a0=\u00a00.9524 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.3909 respectively)."

Accordingly, we performed a pCF analysis using SHR:SHR-GFP in the SCRi line. Line scan measurements were taken across vascular, endodermal, and cortical cells as well as across the extra layer between the endodermis and cortex which is a direct consequence of the RNAi reduction of SCR (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cui et al., 2007</a>). We not only observed SHR movement from the vasculature to the endodermis with a MI\u00a0= 0.66 \u00b1 0.07 (n\u00a0=\u00a014) but also from the endodermis back to the vasculature with a MI\u00a0= 0.78 \u00b1 0.09 (n\u00a0=\u00a014) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Since the MI for SHR:SHR-GFP in SCRi in both directions is not significantly different from the MI for 35S:GFP (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.9553 for endo to vasc, p\u00a0=\u00a00.9999 for vasc to endo) it suggests that movement is unrestricted in both directions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Similarly, we found that SHR is still able to move bidirectionally between the endodermis and cortex (MI\u00a0= 0.61 \u00b1 0.05 from endodermis to cortex, MI = 0.59 \u00b1 0.07 from cortex to endodermis, n\u00a0=\u00a017, Wilcoxon with Steel-Dwass, p\u00a0=\u00a00.9997 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.5510 respectively). These results suggest that the presence of SCR prevents SHR movement specifically from the endodermis back to the vasculature while it does not affect the movement between the endodermis and cortex. To determine if SCR can move with SHR from the endodermis to the cortex, we used pCF on the SCR:SCR-GFP. Our results show that SCR does not move between the endodermis and the cortex, as the MI in either direction is significantly lower than that of 35S:GFP (MI\u00a0= 0.31 \u00b1 0.08 from endodermis to cortex, MI = 0.31 \u00b1 0.07 from cortex to endodermis, n\u00a0=\u00a014, Wilcoxon with Steel-Dwass, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0236 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.0054 respectively). Taken together, our pCF results provide information about the directionality of SHR movement and indicate that SCR restricts SHR movement from the endodermis to the vasculature."

We used the Number and Brightness technique (N\u00a0and\u00a0B), which relies on the RICS image acquisition, to investigate the oligomeric state of the SHR protein in different root cell types. We used the average fluorescence intensity, and the variance in fluorescence, to determine the brightness of particles and their number in an image (<a href=\"#bib6\">Digman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">2009a</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, see Materials and methods).

Our results indicated that SHR exists primarily as a monomer in the vasculature, given that SHR homodimer formation was only 2.6% \u00b1 0.3% in these cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Notably, SHR monomeric proteins are observed in both the nuclei and in the cytoplasm of vasculature cells. By contrast, in the nuclei of the endodermis, there are significantly more SHR homodimers present (7.5% \u00b1 0.9% homodimer, Wilcoxon with Steel-Dwass, p&lt;0.0001) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Moreover, in the endodermis SHR is present at very low levels outside of the nuclei (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). To further understand the differences in SHR oligomeric state, we determined if the homodimer of SHR present in the endodermis could be affected by the presence of SCR. Therefore, we performed N&amp;B; on SHR:SHR-GFP in the SCRi line and observed that SHR is mainly found as a monomer in the endodermis (1.9% \u00b1 0.4% homodimer, Wilcoxon with Steel-Dwass, p\u00a0=\u00a00.2546), indicating that SCR influences the oligomeric composition of SHR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These N&amp;B; results provide a quantitative assessment of SHR\u2019s oligomeric states and their distribution in the vasculature and endodermis."

We next asked if both the monomer and homodimer are able to form a complex with SCR. To test this hypothesis, we performed cross-N&amp;B;, which can determine the stoichiometry of the SHR-SCR complex. Cross N&amp;B; requires that each protein be tagged with a different fluorophore. The analysis then determines which proteins are in a complex by calculating the cross-correlation between the two channels at each pixel (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, see Materials and methods). Accordingly, we generated a transgenic line containing both SHR and SCR tagged with different fluorophores (SHR:SHR-GFP &amp; SCR:SCR-mCherry) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We reasoned that SCR may also exist in higher oligomeric states, which would increase the possible binding ratio of the SHR-SCR complex; therefore we first used N&amp;B; on SCR:SCR-mCherry to determine the oligomeric state of SCR. Initially, we determined the S-factor and brightness of monomeric mCherry protein in the root (UBQ10:mCherry) as we did for the monomeric 35SGFP protein (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In the SCR:SCR-mCherry line, we detected mostly monomers with 4.7% \u00b1 0.5% of homodimers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We tested the oligomeric state of SCR using a SCR:SCR-GFP fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), as it was shown that the type of fluorescent tag can change the behavior of a protein and its aggregation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Brown et al., 2008</a>). We found that the SCR:SCR-GFP line had 5.4% \u00b1 0.7% of homodimers, which is similar to the SCR:SCR-mCherry line (<a href=\"#SD13-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Therefore, when performing the cross-N&amp;B; analysis, we considered the possibility that the homodimer of SCR could be part of the SHR-SCR complex."

After experimentally determining the rate of SHR movement, SHR oligomeric state, and the binding ratio of the SHR-SCR complex, we sought to incorporate this information into a mathematical model of SHR and SCR, with the goal of determining how protein movement and stoichiometry affect SHR and SCR dynamics. Therefore, we constructed a compartmental model that only measures SHR, SCR, and the SHR-SCR complex in both the vasculature and the endodermis (see Materials and methods)."

We chose to use Sobol indices to measure how sensitive the model is to each parameter (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sobol, 2001</a>; see Materials and\u00a0methods). Briefly, the total Sobol effects index measures how much the model outcome varies as the parameters are changed. If small changes in the parameter values cause large changes in the model outcome, then that parameter is more influential. Using this measure, we found that the rate of movement of SHR from the vasculature to the endodermis (<i>a<sub>1</sub>)</i> and from the endodermis to the vasculature (<i>a<sub>2</sub></i>) are both highly influential parameters (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Most of the parameter values were chosen based on the previous mathematical model (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cruz-Ram\u00edrez et al., 2012</a>). However, since this model did not account for different oligomeric states of SHR we estimated some of the parameters using the N&amp;B; data (<a href=\"#SD19-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>; see Materials and methods). Our mathematical model predicts that SHR reaches a steady state in the vasculature and endodermis in a matter of minutes. The levels of SCR increase greatly in the first 3\u2009hr, which is supported by data that show that SCR expression in a SHR inducible system is significant after 3\u2009hr (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sozzani et al, 2010</a>). While the 1:1 SHR-SCR complex increases greatly in the first 3\u2009hr, the 2:1 complex does not form until after 9\u2009hr. This is because the SHR homodimer does not form until about 9\u2009hr into the simulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). We reasoned that this is a plausible scenario because SCR should exceed 60% of steady-state levels to trigger homodimer formation (see Materials and methods). Finally, the entire system reaches a steady-state between 18 and 24\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This suggests that cell division occurs once SCR and the SHR-SCR complexes reach their steady state values."

In this model, we assume that SCR levels are maintained at below 60% of wild type levels as in agreement with previous experimental data (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cui et al, 2007</a>). At these lower levels of SCR, we observe that the steady-state value of the 1:1 SHR-SCR complex is reduced by half (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

Combining RICS and pCF provided detailed understanding of SHR movement both within and between cells of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> root. Trafficking along the radial axis is normally unidirectional - SHR moves from the vasculature to the endodermis, and not in the opposite direction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In the absence of SCR, SHR trafficking is bidirectional. In agreement with the pCF results, our RICS data showed that the DC of SHR in the endodermis increases significantly in the absence of SCR as compared to wild type, indicating that removal of SCR affects the diffusive behavior of SHR. Taken together, these results provide further evidence that SCR, which is present only in the endodermis, spatially restricts SHR movement. The mechanisms underlying this restricted movement remain unclear, and future experiments should focus on uncovering other factors, in addition to SCR, that can bind SHR (<a href=\"#bib27\">Long et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Moreno-Risueno et al., 2015</a>).

On the other hand, both RICS and pCF are applied to frames or lines, respectively, which increase the spatial resolution and the statistical power of the analysis by simultaneously measuring the movement of many individual molecules in time and space. Moreover, RICS and pCF introduce a spatial component that can determine whether slow movement is due to a binding interaction or slow diffusion, which FRAP and single-point FCS cannot do. Thus, these scanning FCS methods are robust against cell movement and other artifacts that could bias measurements taken with other single-point methods."

The slower movement of SHR could be due to its size alone. However, since the DC of SHR is three-fold smaller than the DC of 35S:GFP, and the DC is inversely proportional to the cube root of the molecular weight of the protein (<a href=\"#bib56\">Young et al., 1980</a>), the change in DC is not attributable to the molecular weight of SHR (~60\u00a0kDa). If it were, then the molecular weight of SHR would have to be 27-fold higher than that of GFP, or approximately 729\u2009kDa (<a href=\"#bib33\">Prendergast and Manni, 1978</a>). Further, the decrease in the DC of SHR relative to 35S:GFP, in addition to the pCF analysis which shows unidirectional movement, suggests an active regulation of SHR movement, which is in agreement with previous data (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gallagher et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sena et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gallagher and Benfey, 2009</a>).

The presence of the SHR homodimer in the nucleus and loss of the homodimer in the SCRi line indicate that SCR is required to maintain SHR in its higher oligomeric forms.

This suggests that future experiments that aim to understand the details of the SHR-SCR GRN should focus on a time scale of hours to measure its dynamics. In addition, the sensitivity analysis revealed that diffusion is one of the most important parameters in our model, motivating the need to experimentally measure the diffusion coefficient. In the simulation of SCRi, our model showed that the 2:1 complex does not form and the 1:1 complex is reduced to half of normal levels. This suggests that the mutant layer in the SCRi line is likely due to a reduction in the SHR-SCR complex. These results only scratch the surface of what is likely to be a complex network regulating the spatial localization of SHR as a mobile transcription factor and developmental regulator. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of physical interactions between transcription factors as a regulatory component of transcription factor intercellular trafficking networks. The three scanning FCS methodologies utilized here (pCF, RICS, and N&B) gave consistent results providing strong evidence for their reliability. Our data suggest that the application of in vivo molecule tracking techniques is virtually limitless, which opens exciting new opportunities in all fields of biology."

The PSF was measured for each objective and each confocal microscope used for image acquisition. To calibrate the PSF for our objective lens, we performed RICS on free EGFP in an aqueous solution. While we determined the PSF using free EGFP in solution, it is possible that the PSF varies depending on the cell or tissue we are imaging. However, the exact value of the PSF is not as important for these scanning FCS techniques as it is for single-point FCS since the scanning techniques measure the time a molecule takes to go from one pixel to the next (<a href=\"#bib10\">Digman et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Petrasek and Schwille, 2008</a>). Thus we made the assumption that the PSF determined using the EGFP solution is an accurate estimation of the true PSF. Accordingly, raster images of a solution of 0.6 \u00b5M EGFP were acquired using commercial CLSMs, including the Zeiss 780 and 710 (Zeiss Inc, Germany). We determined the PSF by fitting the autocorrelation function (ACF) to the intensity fluctuations of free EGFP in aqueous solution, obtained from the raster images, while fixing the known EGFP diffusion coefficient of 78 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2002</a>). The ACF then returned the experimental PSF beam waist (<a href=\"#SD18-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>).

In particular, RICS can be used to determine the rate of movement of a GFP-labeled protein, such as SHR:SHR-GFP. During a RICS measurement, the laser performs a raster scan across a selected region of interest. The raster scan involves scanning from left to right across a set number of pixels and then retracing, without backtracking across the already imaged pixels, to perform the next line below. The scanning is repeated for multiple consecutive lines until a 256x256 pixel frame is created, and then starts over again to obtain between 50 to 100 time points. Because each pixel is collected at a different time, and we know where each pixel is located, there is spatial and temporal information included in each individual image (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This spatio-temporal information can be used to extract the diffusion coefficient of a population of molecules using the RICS algorithm, which has two steps: (1) background subtraction and (2) image correlation. The background subtraction removes stationary and slow-moving objects so that the image autocorrelation only detects the dynamics of diffusing species (<a href=\"#bib5\">Digman et al., 2005a</a>) while the image correlation compares each pixel to its adjacent pixel in both the x and y direction."

For the RICS analysis, the software can reduce the region of interest (ROI) from 256x256 pixels to 128 \u00d7\u00a0128 pixels in order to obtain a more enriched cell population. For example, we used this feature to obtain QC-enriched populations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). After selecting the ROI to use, the software uses the moving average (see RICS) to eliminate any artifacts from immobile fractions. Then, the software fits the RICS-ACF using the imaging parameters provided (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and returns the diffusion coefficient of the protein. The diffusion coefficient returned results in the ACF curve that best fits the data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Goodness of fit was determined by comparing the residuals to the amplitude of the ACF. We only kept images where the maximum value of the ACF was three fold larger than the greatest residual in order for the RICS analysis to be reliable (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Images that had residuals larger than this threshold generally had low laser intensity or sample movement were not used for analysis."

When there was photobleaching in the sample, we eliminated some of the frames acquired at later time points. A period average of 800 frames was then applied so that trends in the fluorescence carpet are easier to see. The carpet is displayed as a gradient, with red corresponding to high correlation and blue corresponding to low correlation. Next, the autocorrelation of each of the 32 pixels in the line scan was calculated using a moving average of 200 frames. The resulting image was a 32 column image where each of the columns represented the autocorrelation value of that pixel. At this step, the 32 columns were aligned with the reference image to determine the pixel location of the cell wall. The location of the cell wall was then used as the column distance (<math id=\"inf4\"><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></math> in order to calculate the pCF.

The pCF in the opposite direction was then calculated by correlating pixels from right to left, instead of left to right. To account for the fact that the cell wall is not straight, the pCF was calculated using pixel distances of 5, 7, and 9. Given that there is heterogeneity in the cell size and cell wall orientation in the root, we would not capture differences by using only one pixel distance. Finally, the color scale of the pCF was adjusted such that high correlation is represented as red, low correlation is represented as blue, and no correlation is black."

Since the intensity is not used in the N&amp;B; calculation, the exact values of the intensity for each fluorophore do not matter. Background images have two distinct populations representing the monomer and the background. The background brightness was standardized by setting the S-factor parameter such that the background population is centered at <i>B\u00a0=\u00a01</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

We defined <i>a<sub>1</sub></i> as the experimentally determined diffusion coefficient (<i>D<sub>1</sub></i>) divided by the area of a vasculature cell (<i>A<sub>1</sub></i>). We measured the area of vascular cells (n\u00a0=\u00a019) using ImageJ, and averaged them to determine <i>A<sub>1</sub></i> (<a href=\"#SD19-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Although the diffusion coefficient returned by RICS is from a population of vascular and endodermal cells, we assumed that it is a good approximation of SHR movement between one vascular and one endodermal cell. We included a second active transport term for movement in the reverse direction, from the endodermis to the vasculature, where <i>a<sub>2</sub></i>is the active transport rate. However, based on the pCF analysis, <i>a<sub>2</sub> =</i> 0 since normally there is no bidirectional movement. Adding linear degradation gave us the equation for the change in SHR in the vasculature over time."

Notably, we reasoned that small changes in highly influential parameters could result in large changes in the model outcome. In addition, it has been shown that parameter estimation can become more computationally complex and produce more uncertainty in the parameter values as the number of estimated parameters increases (<a href=\"#bib44\">Smith, 2014</a>). Therefore, we focused on estimating only the most influential parameters. We chose to use Sobol decomposition to measure how sensitive the model is to a particular parameter (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sobol, 2001</a>). Sobol decomposition is a variance-based method, meaning that the sensitivity of the model to a parameter is quantified by calculating the variance in the model outcome. In addition, Sobol decomposition is a global sensitivity method, so we are exploring the entire parameter space in order to determine the most influential parameters (<a href=\"#bib44\">Smith, 2014</a>)."

Therefore, for the homodimer formation term <i>k<sub>2</sub></i>, we chose <i>C<sub>0</sub></i> to be 60% of the steady-state value of SCR. By choosing this value, the homodimer will not form until the concentration of SCR is above 60%. Additionally, we chose <i>k\u00a0=\u00a0</i>0.1 so that homodimer formation occurs rapidly after SCR passes the threshold (<a href=\"#SD19-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>).

Their earlier studies have revealed that SHR moves from the vasculature into the adjacent cell layer where it activates SCR expression, which is proposed to delimit further SHR movement through hetero-dimerisation. To probe the underlying mechanism, the authors have employed innovative techniques based on Fluorescent Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) to non-invasively and quantitatively study SHR-SCR mobility and interactions. These tools allowed them to measure the diffusion of the GFP-tagged species, to determine that a binding partner slows this diffusion, to show that the presence of the binding partner in some cells creates a directional net motion of the factor towards the cell with the partner, and to make a measure of the likely stoichiometry of the factor and this partner. These conclusions are made possible by innovations in the measurement of species inside cells, often using aspects of the data that others merely ignore or discard and extends these tools to applications in the intact <i>Arabidopsis</i> root."

The authors present techniques (that they say are novel) in a fashion more appropriate for techniques that are in everyday use. The reviewers (who are experts in these techniques) found the descriptions difficult to follow, and thus for many readers the paper will be impenetrable. A couple of sentences of introduction at the beginning of each section on what the technique is, or a cartoon in some cases would help tremendously to solve this. The authors also use things that are equivalent in their minds somewhat too interchangeably and without using the terms to help the reader understand. As an example of how the text impresses rather than illuminates, consider these sentences in the introduction: \"To that end, we explored the possibility of combining scanning Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (scanning FCS) techniques. These are different from the more common time correlation FCS techniques as they are based on the probability of finding a molecule at a given distance from a starting point with a time delay (Petrasek and Schwille, 2008, Digman and Gratton, 2011). In particular, we employed spatial temporal probability techniques to measure protein movement, protein-protein interactions, and the stoichiometry of protein complexes.\""

The authors present techniques (that they say are novel) in a fashion more appropriate for techniques that are in everyday use. The reviewers (who are experts in these techniques) found the descriptions difficult to follow, and thus for many readers the paper will be impenetrable. A couple of sentences of introduction at the beginning of each section on what the technique is, or a cartoon in some cases would help tremendously to solve this. The authors also use things that are equivalent in their minds somewhat too interchangeably and without using the terms to help the reader understand. As an example of how the text impresses rather than illuminates, consider these sentences in the introduction: \"To that end, we explored the possibility of combining scanning Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (scanning FCS) techniques. These are different from the more common time correlation FCS techniques as they are based on the probability of finding a molecule at a given distance from a starting point with a time delay (Petrasek and Schwille, 2008, Digman and Gratton, 2011). In particular, we employed spatial temporal probability techniques to measure protein movement, protein-protein interactions, and the stoichiometry of protein complexes.\"</i> "

In addition to the schematics, we have added sentences to the beginning of each Results section that briefly describe the techniques used. We rewrote sections of the main text in order to make both the techniques and our results more accessible to the reader. We made sure that we included the rationale behind using all of the different techniques so that the reader understands when each technique is appropriate. Specifically, we now say why we use the technique, how it is performed, and what the results tell us. Although we have added more explanatory material to the main text, we made sure that the Materials and methods section still contains most of the details about each of the scanning FCS methods, as well as how to use the SimFCS software."

Accordingly, we constructed an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of SHR and SCR in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> root. Using a sensitivity analysis, we show that the diffusion coefficient of SHR is an extremely sensitive parameter, motivating the use of these biophysical techniques to experimentally determine protein movement. Further, we estimated some of the other parameter values using our oligomeric state and complex stoichiometry data from N&amp;B; and Cross N&amp;B.; Our model reveals new mechanistic insights about SHR and SCR dynamics in the root. Specifically, our model predicts that SCR expression is activated approximately 3 hours after influx of SHR. This prediction is supported by previous experiments in which SCR expression in a SHR inducible system is observed after 3 hours of induction (Sozzani et al. 2010, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Further, we show that the 2:1 complex forms later than the 1:1 complex (9 hours vs 3 hours) and that the entire system reaches a steady state between 18 and 24 hours. Our model allows us to better understand how SHR movement and SHR-SCR complex formation significantly contribute to root patterning."
