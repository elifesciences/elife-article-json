In eukaryotic cells, nutrients and growth factors regulate ribosomal RNA transcription through various key factors coupled to cell growth. We show here in mature adipocytes, ribosomal transcription can be acutely regulated in response to metabolic challenges. This acute response is mediated by PTRF (polymerase I transcription and release factor, also known as cavin-1), which has previously been shown to play a critical role in caveolae formation. The caveolae\u2013independent rDNA transcriptional role of PTRF not only explains the lipodystrophy phenotype observed in PTRF deficient mice and humans, but also highlights its crucial physiological role in maintaining adipocyte allostasis. Multiple post-translational modifications of PTRF provide mechanistic bases for its regulation. The role of PTRF in ribosomal transcriptional efficiency is likely relevant to many additional physiological situations of cell growth and organismal metabolism."

Without treatment or a change in lifestyle, this insulin resistance may develop into diabetes. However, \u201chealthy obese\u201d individuals also exist, who can accommodate an overabundance of fat without developing insulin resistance and diabetes."

Ribosome biogenesis, the process of making ribosomes, is a complex and energy intensive process that involves transcriptional regulators, protein modification, and the assembly of multi-component macromolecular complexes (reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grummt, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kusnadi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Russell and Zomerdijk, 2005</a>). Synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is generally considered as a major rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis, and it produces the common 47S precursor of mature 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNAs (review in [<a href=\"#bib39\">Moss et al., 2007</a>]). The 47S pre-rRNA is transcribed from hundreds of copies of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes distributed in repeated arrays among 5 acrocentric chromosomes in humans (<a href=\"#bib24\">Henderson et al., 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Stults et al., 2008</a>). Given the large numbers of rDNA genes, rRNA transcription can be regulated by both varying the number of transcriptionally active genes and/or by varying the rate of activated transcription. The former can be regulated through chromatin remodeling and related factors, and the latter can be acutely regulated through the factors assembled in Pol-I transcription complex machinery (reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grummt, 2010</a>)."

Any perturbation that changes cell growth or protein synthesis, such as nutrient and growth factor availability, senescence, toxin exposure or viral infection, leads to changes in rDNA transcription activity (reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kusnadi et al., 2015</a>). This regulatory process comprises a series of coordinated steps including transcription initiation, promoter escape, elongation and termination (reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib48\">Russell and Zomerdijk, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schneider, 2012</a>). Regulation is achieved <i>via</i> coordinated multiple signaling pathways that modulate the expression and activities of many key factors, such as Pol I-specific transcription factors (RRN3, also known as transcription initiation factor 1A, TIF-1A), selectivity factor 1 (SL-1; also known as TIF-1B), upstream binding factor (UBF) and others (reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bywater et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Grummt, 2010</a>). Most of these studies were performed in cultured cancer or cancer-like cell lines, where ribosomal transcriptional regulation was coupled to cell proliferation or closely related cell growth. For cell mass growth in mature non-proliferating cells, it\u2019s less clear if and how ribosomal transcription is regulated, and the physiological relevance of ribosomal RNA transcription in these cells has been little studied."

As a mature non-proliferating cell type, it undergoes dramatic changes upon metabolic challenges. In obesity due to excess calorie loading, adipocytes need to develop not only corresponding cellular structures and functions for the increasing needs in lipid storage and metabolic capacity, but also the machinery for the secretion of adipokines and other proteins. These cells also have to maintain an insulin sensitive functional response in order to avoid the development of type 2 diabetes. Given the importance of homeostatic protein synthesis as a basic cellular function to maintain structure and activity, and to ensure normal cellular physiological functions, it becomes obvious that 'healthy' adipocyte expansion has to be supported by fundamental processes such as protein synthesis, which in turn, can be determined by ribosome biogenesis. Changes in ribosomal RNA synthesis by long term starvation and re-feeding were in fact reported soon after ribosomes were first described (<a href=\"#bib6\">Benjamin and Gellhorn, 1966</a>) although many mechanistic details of ribosome composition and function were unknown at that time. The effect of insulin on protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis in adipocytes was also reported (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hansson and Ingelman-Sundberg, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Vydelingum et al., 1983</a>).

Moreover, the physiological relevance of this activity was never established in cells or in vivo. Consequently, we used primary mouse and cultured adipocyte experimental systems to show that PTRF localized to the nucleus and associated with the pol I transcription complex, playing a direct role on metabolically regulated ribosomal DNA transcription. A number of PTRF post-translational modifications and motifs can explain its nuclear translocation and the role in mediating insulin and nutrient-regulated ribosomal transcription. PTRF also plays a critical role in maintaining the active rDNA transcriptional 'loop' formation. Our studies not only show a specific role of PTRF on metabolism-regulated ribosomal DNA transcription in the adipocyte, they add another layer of regulation to rDNA transcriptional complexity. They also highlight the role of ribosome biogenesis in adipocyte allostasis."

To further confirm this, we fractionated 3T3-L1 adipocytes into nuclear and non-nuclear fractions by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, a significant portion of PTRF translocated to nucleus upon insulin stimulation. In contrast other caveolae component proteins such as caveolin-1, Cavin-2 (SDPR), and Cavin-3 (SRBC) did not show any nuclear localization or stimulated translocation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), suggesting a specific role of PTRF on rRNA transcriptional regulation. We performed an immunoprecipitation from the nuclear fraction with PTRF antibody, and consistent with the prior in-vitro assay (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jansa et al., 1998</a>), our data indicated PTRF binds to TTF1 (polymerase I transcription termination factor 1) in cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using a PTRF antibody followed by qPCR using primers probing the ribosomal transcription termination region. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, the occupancy of PTRF in the termination complex is significantly regulated by the nutrient availability and insulin. These results show PTRF nuclear localization and binding to the rDNA transcription complex, suggesting that PTRF might play a functional role in ribosomal transcription activity in cells."

                                "text": "Previous studies have shown that rDNA transcription can be acutely regulated by nutrients and growth factors (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib39\">Moss et al., 2007</a>]). After pre ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) is synthesized, the first step is to remove the 5\u2019 portion of the 5\u2019-externally transcribed spacer (5\u2019-ETS) to generate 45S pre-rRNA (<a href=\"#bib12\">Craig et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gurney, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Miller and Sollner-Webb, 1981</a>). The length of the removed region, known as the leader fragment of the 5\u2019-ETS, is 650 bases in mouse and 414 bases in human. Because this leader sequence is rapidly excised and degraded after transcription (<a href=\"#bib46\">Puvion-Dutilleul et al., 1997</a>), its quantity in the nucleolus is a sensitive and highly selective marker of the amount of the nascent 47S pre-rRNA and hence, a widely used indicator of the rate of ribosomal transcription. Here we let 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and differentiated adipocytes 'rest' in PBS with 1% BSA for 3\u20134\u2009hr, then switched them back to full culture medium (10% FBS in high glucose DMEM) with insulin. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, pre-rRNA 47S levels were significantly up-regulated by this culture condition change. Compared to fibroblastic cells, the response in adipocytes is 2-fold higher, suggesting an adipocyte-specific rDNA transcription regulation mechanism as the levels of PTRF are much higher in the latter as compared to the former (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bastiani et al., 2009</a>). To see if PTRF played any role on this regulation, we isolated primary adipocytes from 6\u20138 weeks old wild type and PTRF null mice and challenged them with similar medium changes by switching from 1% BSA/KRP buffer to 10% FBS in high glucose DMEM with 100nM insulin. A dramatic defect of rDNA transcription up-regulation was observed in PTRF null cells as compared to wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). A time-course experiment further showed the peak of rDNA transcription in response to a metabolic challenge was significantly blunted in PTRF null cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

To mimic these physiological conditions in vitro, we repeatedly challenged WT and PTRF null 3T3-L1 adipocytes by repeated 'feeding', and 'fasting' at 12-hr intervals. After seven days, the PTRF null adipocytes showed a dramatically lower lipid content, less total protein and less total and 47S RNA levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), which essentially recapitulated the lipodystrophy characteristics observed in the PTRF knockout mouse model and human patients with PTRF deficiencies. These data suggest a PTRF-dependent ribosomal transcriptional response may be the early and direct causal mechanism for the pathogenesis of in vivo lipodystrophy. Interestingly we saw a subunit of RNA polymerase I, PolR1A dramatically decreased upon 3T3-L1 differentiation, whereas PTRF and TTF1 levels increased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), suggesting a possible adipocyte-specific termination factor-dependent mechanism for the rDNA transcription regulations (See Discussion)."

Here we first examined p53 activation in PTRF null 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We did not observe a significant p53 and MDM2 protein level change at basal condition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, left). However when we challenged the cells with 'feeding' medium, PTRF null cells showed a poor rRNA response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), higher ribosomal protein rpl5 levels, lower mdm2 and higher p53 nuclear accumulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, right), indicating p53 pathway activation. This is probably due to insufficient rRNA synthesis causing a relative increased accumulation of ribosomal proteins in the nucleus, which is also called nuclear stress. When we challenged the cells by 'fasting' medium, the inefficient rRNA transcription regulation was confirmed in PTRF null cells comparing to WT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). However we saw opposite responses of p53 activation, which was transiently up-regulated in control wild type cells and lost in PTRF null adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This response in wild type cells seems to be only at cell arrest levels (activated <i>p21, gadd45</i>, and <i>cdkn1a</i>), not cell apoptosis (unchanged levels of <i>atm, Bax</i> and <i>caps2</i>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), which probably represents some level of cell response under nutrient starved conditions. When we examined the adipose tissue from PTRF null mice, a full range of p53 activation targets including both cell arrest and apoptosis all were up regulated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013G</a>), indicating a long term adipocyte apoptosis."

However the functional relevance of this modification in a physiological context remains unknown. Consistent with previous results, we show here that insulin stimulates PTRF tyrosine phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Interestingly another caveolae protein in the cavin family, SDPR (Serum deprivation response protein, Cavin-2) co-immunoprecipitated with PTRF (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bastiani et al., 2009</a>) also showed increased insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation but it does not undergo nuclear translocation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Next we investigated whether this modification plays any role in rDNA transcription regulation. Since PTRF has only 4 tyrosine sites, we substituted each of these with phenylalanine, Y158F showed a significant decrease in phosphotyrosine levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Accordingly, this mutant form (Y158F) shows a significant inhibitory effect on rDNA transcription activity when transfected into PTRF null MEF cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), suggesting a critical role for this phosphorylation site in mediating the up-regulation of rDNA transcription activity in response to feeding medium."

PTRF has two putative nuclear localization signals (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aboulaich et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kalderon et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wei et al., 2015</a>).

The NES is a short amino acid sequence of hydrophobic residues in a protein that targets it for export from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex by interacting with exportin, and the common NES sequence motif is 'LxxLxxLxL', where 'L' is a hydrophobic residue (often leucine) and 'x' is any other amino acid (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bogerd et al., 1996</a>). To investigate if this NES signal plays any role in PTRF nuclear localization, we generated a mutant by deletion of this region and expressed it in HEK293 cells. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> this mutant was exclusive localized in the nucleus, probably due to the loss of nuclear export signal. When we transfected it into PTRF null primary MEFs cells, unlike wild type, this mutant cannot rescue 'feeding' medium 47S up-regulation under cell growth arrest condition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), indicating a nuclear export 'recycling'\u00a0process is needed for maintaining PTRF ribosomal transcription regulatory activity."

By immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, we showed that PTRF is mono-ubiquitinated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D and E</a>). Based on the size of 8\u2009kDa for each ubiquitin protein, PTRF seems to be mono-ubiquitinated at two sites. Thus we expressed 8 PTRF truncation constructs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated them with anti-myc antibody followed by western blot using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>, it\u00a0seems that two regions (166-192aa and 193-249aa) are responsible for one mono-ubiquitination each. Protein monoubiquitination has recently emerged as an important posttranslational modification regulating transcription, endocytic vesicle trafficking, histone modification, and DNA repair (<a href=\"#bib16\">Friedberg, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pemberton and Paschal, 2005</a>). For example, the addition of a mono-ubiquitin tag to p53 is sufficient for its nuclear export; p53 monoubiquitination may cooperatively interact with its nuclear export signal (NES) for cytoplasmic targeting (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carter et al., 2007</a>). NLS can also be regulated by monoubiquitination signals. Studies have suggested that monoubiquitination can mask its NLS resulting in cytoplasmic retention (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen and Mallampalli, 2009</a>). Our data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>, taken together, suggest the localization of PTRF in caveolae or in the nucleus might be coordinated by monoubiquitination, NLS and NES motifs."

However insulin-stimulated PTRF nuclear translocation was completely blocked (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), indicating the localization of PTRF in caveolae is critical for this translocation. Furthermore immunoblot analyses of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in cell lysates showed that PTRF tyrosine phosphorylation was largely inhibited although the insulin stimulated IRS-1/2 (180\u2009kDa) and the beta-subunit of insulin receptor (95\u2009kDa) (arrows) were not affected by beta-CD treatment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

The active rDNA transcription complex forms nucleotide loops by jointing initiation and termination regions together (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grummt and Langst, 2013</a>). Here we tested if PTRF plays any role on this active loop formation. By using a chromosome conformation capture assay (3C assay) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nemeth et al., 2008</a>), we pulled down the transcriptional complex and ligated the DNA fragments followed by PCR using primers targeting the initiation and termination loci (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>).

When PTRF/Cavin-1 is knocked out in mice or lost through mutation in humans, caveolae are absent and the metabolic consequences are severe, including muscular and lipodystrophies. The possible explanation(s) proposed for the adipocyte lipodystrophic phenotype include alterations in lipid transport and/or altered plasma membrane adaptations (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pilch and Liu, 2011</a>), but these do not fully explain the progressive nature of the lipodystrophy observed in vivo. The transport/membrane defects would be present at birth presumably causing an immediate fat cell deficiency. On the other hand and given that the lipodystrophy of PTRF/Cavin-1 null mice and humans has a progressive severity, PTRF\u2019s eponymous function in rRNA synthesis does indeed provide a possible explanation whereby decreased rRNA transcription as a function of time would lead to adipocyte loss due to the inability to maintain adequate protein levels, and we present data here in support of this hypothesis."

Here we confirm that PTRF is present in the nucleus of fat cells, and indeed, it functions in these cells to promote rRNA transcription (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). The data of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a> derive from a comparison of WT and PTRF null primary mouse fat cells and gene edited cultured fat cells, and taken together, support the hypothesis that inefficient rRNA transcription underlies the lipodystrophy observed in mice and humans. Moreover, the absence of PTRF would be expected to lead to ribosomal stress, which in turn would lead to fat cell loss over time, and we find evidence for this process in fat cells from PTRF null mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

These results make physiological sense by adjusting potential ribosomal activity to the nutritional status of the cell. A further level of regulation may be achieved by ubiquitination and we have verified the necessity of the nuclear export signal in PTRF dynamics (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Our data (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) support the idea that intact caveolae are required for PTRF tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear function.

This is closely correlated with pre-adipocyte proliferation. Upon adipocyte differentiation and consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2006</a>) Pol-I levels were dramatically decreased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), whereas PTRF and TTF-1 levels were increased correspondingly, indicating ribosomal transcription in mature adipocyte became less Pol-I dependent, and more reliant on the regulation of transcriptional efficiency through the termination machinery. Our results support the notion that cells have developed at least these two different mechanisms to ensure proper control of ribosomal transcription in a cell type and physiological condition-specific manner. One mechanism is Pol-I dependent active transcriptional number regulation, which plays major role in proliferating cells. The other is termination factor, PTRF-dependent transcriptional rate regulation, which plays a critical role in mature differentiated cells in response to nutrient challenges. In fact, all cells must maintain a certain level of ribosomal activity to maintain protein expression upon their normal turnover, and nutritionally stressed cells such as adipocytes have a particular need for this activity. These cells are subject to repeated cycles of feeding and fasting, and indeed, we show in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), the consequences of PTRF deficiency in this regard. We see no apparent differences in protein and fat content between WT and PTRF null fat cells until we expose them to the metabolic stress of repeated fasting and refeeding cycles. The PTRF null cells show a dramatic reduction in total triglyceride, RNA and protein content which essentially recapitulates the lipodystrophy in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) that is occurring in vivo in PTRF deficient mice and humans."

What has been observed is that some individuals respond to over-nutrition by fat cell expansion requiring ribosomal activity to amass the additional proteins required to increase the size of fat cells and accommodate the excess nutrients as triglyceride, the so-called healthy obese individuals who lack obvious metabolic pathology. On the other hand, most people apparently fail to mount an adequate adipocyte adaptive response, and this results in fat spilling over to liver and muscle resulting in hepatosteatosis and type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize that the capacity of adaptational ribosomal DNA transcription may determine the maximal limit of adipocyte functional homeostasis and may coincide with these metabolic perturbations. In support of this idea, mice were exposed to conditions of normal, over and under nutrition from birth to weaning and then subjected to the same diet and followed for up to 112 days. The mice subject to undernourishment show an apparent inability for adipose tissue expansion that correlates with PTRF expression (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kozak et al., 2010</a>). Together these data and ours suggest the PTRF-dependent ribosomal transcriptional response to metabolic challenges may be the early and direct causal molecular mechanism for the pathological developments of adipose tissue function in vivo, lipodystrophy in the worst case scenario."

The nuclei were pelleted, resuspended in nuclear buffer with 0.3% SDS and incubated for 1\u2009hr at 37\u00b0C. Triton-X100 (1.8%) was added to sequester the SDS followed by the addition of high concentration BglII and BamHI (NEB) to digest the chromatin overnight at 37\u00b0C with gentle shaking. The restriction enzymes were inactivated by the addition of SDS to 1.6% and incubation at 70\u00b0C for 15\u2009min. The reaction mixture was diluted with 1x ligase buffer (NEB) and incubated for 1\u2009hr at 37\u00b0C. Ligation of DNA was done using T4 ligase for overnight at 16\u00b0C. Following reversal of cross-linking and DNA extraction, the samples were subjected to qPCR quantification. The various primer combinations were tested for their amplification efficiency using a control template prepared by mixing mouse rDNA plasmids in equimolar amounts, followed by digestion with BglII and BamHI and subsequent ligation."

As shown in the new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, when caveolae integrity was disrupted by cholesterol depletion using methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (see Liu and Pilch, JBC 2008;283(7):4314-22 and Breen et al., PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e34516.), there was essentially complete loss of caveolae and consequently, insulin-stimulated PTRF tyrosine phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and effects on ribosomal transcription. The total level of PTRF is unchanged in this protocol. These data are consistent with intact caveolae being necessary for PTRF phosphorylation and subsequent proper targeting to the nucleus, hence its function on rRNA transcription. A new section describing these results has been added to the revised manuscript. Although caveolin-1 null cells might have been an ideal model to test PTRF caveolae-independent function, we and others have shown that the expression levels of caveolin-1 and PTRF are always linked to one other in existing physiological models such as cav-1 or cavin-1/PTRF null mice. Thus there is essentially no PTRF in the <i>Cav1</i> null mouse (Liu and Pilch, unpublished; Hansen et al., Nat Commun. 2013; 4: 1831). Together with the other figures presented in this manuscript, we believe our data clearly show a distinction between PTRF function in the nucleus and in caveolae."

Thus there is no overall movement of caveolae, just PTRF, which undergoes a specific translocation from plasma membrane caveolae to the nucleus in response to insulin. In the context of caveolae positive cells, PTRF translocation through cellular compartment(s) other than caveolae, the cytosol in particular, appears to be unlikely. First, the data presented in the new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> are consistent with PTRF localization in caveolae being necessary for translocation. In the context of PTRF in caveolae positive cells, we showed (Breen et al., PLoS1, 2012) by cell fractionation that the amount of this protein in the cytosol is very small (&lt;5%) compared to that at present in caveolae. Moreover, these data may be the result of cell disruption, not intrinsic localization, as PTRF/cavin-1 dissociates from caveolae upon membrane and osmolarity stress (Sinha et al., Cell 2011, 144:402-413) both of which occur during cell disruption. Thus we think our data, including the new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, clarify how PTRF localizes to caveolae, probably exclusively, and then translocates to the nucleus upon its insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation."
