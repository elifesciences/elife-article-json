Although the striatum is thought to consist of sensorimotor, associative and limbic domains, their precise demarcations and whether additional functional subdivisions exist remain unclear. How striatal inputs are differentially segregated into each domain is also poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive map of the excitatory inputs to the mouse striatum. The input patterns reveal boundaries between the known striatal domains. The most posterior striatum likely represents the 4th functional subdivision, and the dorsomedial striatum integrates highly heterogeneous, multimodal inputs. The complete thalamo-cortico-striatal loop is also presented, which reveals that the thalamic subregions innervated by the basal ganglia preferentially interconnect with motor-related cortical areas. Optogenetic experiments show the subregion-specific heterogeneity in the synaptic properties of striatal inputs from both the cortex and the thalamus. This projectome will guide functional studies investigating diverse striatal functions."

Although the striatum is thought to consist of sensorimotor, associative and limbic domains, their precise demarcations and whether additional functional subdivisions exist remain unclear. How striatal inputs are differentially segregated into each domain is also poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive map of the excitatory inputs to the mouse striatum. The input patterns reveal boundaries between the known striatal domains. The most posterior striatum likely represents the 4th functional subdivision, and the dorsomedial striatum integrates highly heterogeneous, multimodal inputs. The complete thalamo-cortico-striatal loop is also presented, which reveals that the thalamic subregions innervated by the basal ganglia preferentially interconnect with motor-related cortical areas. Optogenetic experiments show the subregion-specific heterogeneity in the synaptic properties of striatal inputs from both the cortex and the thalamus. This projectome will guide functional studies investigating diverse striatal functions."

For example, the cortex and thalamus communicate with another structure known as the basal ganglia, which is essential for controlling voluntary movement, emotions and reward behaviour in humans and other mammals. Information from the cortex and the thalamus enters the basal ganglia at an area called the striatum. This area is further divided into smaller functional regions known as domains that sort sensorimotor, emotion and executive information into the basal ganglia to control different types of behaviour. Three such domains have been identified in the striatum of mice. However, the boundaries between these domains are vague and it is not clear whether any other domains exist or if the domains can actually be divided into even smaller areas with more precise roles."

Now, Hunnicutt et al. present the first comprehensive map of excitatory inputs into the striatum of mice. The experiments show that while many of the excitatory inputs flowing into the striatum from the cortex and thalamus are sorted into the three known domains, a unique combination of the excitatory inputs are sorted into a new domain instead. One of the original three domains of the striatum is known to relay information related to associative learning, for example, linking an emotion to a person or place. Hunnicutt et al. show that this domain has a more complex architecture than the other domains, being made up of many distinct areas. This complexity may help it to process the various types of information required to make such associations."

                        "text": "Neuronal circuits within large brain structures, such as the cortex and the thalamus, are organized around functional subregions. For example, the cortex contains many distinct functional areas, including the sensory subregions, which are defined by specific sensory inputs, and the motor subregions, which are defined by intracortical microstimulation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li and Waters, 1991</a>). The thalamic subregions have traditionally been defined by cytoarchitectural boundaries to delineate\u00a0~40 nuclei (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jones, 2007</a>). In contrast, the spatial organization of the striatum is poorly defined, particularly in mice. The striatum is thought to contain three functional domains: the sensorimotor, associative, and limbic domains, which approximately correspond to the dorsolateral, dorsomedial, and ventral striatum, respectively (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balleine et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Belin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gruber and McDonald, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Thorn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yin and Knowlton, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yin et al., 2005</a>). However, the precise demarcations between these striatal domains remain unclear, and it is not known whether each striatal domain contains finer levels of organization. Notably, although the striatum extends a significant length along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis (~4 mm in mice), the existence of domain heterogeneity along this axis remains elusive."

For example, in primates, the motor cortex has been shown to project to the rostral putamen, which corresponds to the rostral dorsolateral striatum, whereas the premotor cortex projects to the rostral caudate, which corresponds to the rostral dorsomedial striatum (<a href=\"#bib37\">K\u00fcnzle, 1975</a>). Investigation of the topographic arrangement of corticostriatal inputs from selected cortical subregions, or to isolated parts of the striatum have also been initiated in mice (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wall et al., 2013</a>). However, the precise projection patterns from most cortical subregions to the entire striatum remain to be systematically characterized. Furthermore, the organization of thalamostriatal inputs, which provide\u00a0~1/3 of all glutamatergic synapses in the striatum (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huerta-Ocampo et al., 2014</a>), has been less studied. In primates, the centromedian/parafascicular (CM/Pf) complex of the thalamus has been the main focus in studies of thalamostriatal function (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fran\u00e7ois et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Smith et al., 2011</a>), yet less is known about the thalamostriatal projections from other thalamic subregions."

For example, recent functional studies suggest that corticostriatal and thalamostriatal axons differ in their release probability and plasticity properties (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ding et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Smeal et al., 2007</a>), but the precise differences have been controversial (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ding et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Smeal et al., 2007</a>). This controversy raises the possibility of heterogeneity within axons originating from different cortical or thalamic subregions in their synaptic properties (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</a>). A comprehensive excitatory input wiring diagram will provide a road map to enable systematic examination of the differential function of individual inputs. In addition, since the excitatory input patterns are thought to be stereotypic in the striatum, we reasoned that the striatal subregions and their boundaries may be revealed by systematic analysis of these input patterns from individual cortical and thalamic subregions."

Analyses of this striatal excitatory input wiring diagram revealed clear boundaries separating the three traditional striatal domains and uncovered a fourth subdivision in the posterior striatum. The dorsomedial striatum exhibited the highest degree of cortical input heterogeneity, suggesting that this subdivision serves as an information hub. In addition, thalamic subregions receiving basal ganglia outputs are preferentially interconnected with motor-related cortical subregions. With all the pathways tested, the anatomically described corticostriatal and thalamostriatal projections were confirmed to be functional using optogenetic approaches. Importantly, striatal inputs originating from different cortical or thalamic subregions form synapses in the striatum with distinct plasticity properties. Our findings lay the foundation for understanding the function of the striatum and its interactions with the cortex and the thalamus."

To overcome this problem, we used a whole brain image dataset produced from 218 highly overlapping viral injections that covered\u00a0&gt;93% of the thalamic volume (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</a>). The overlapping injections allow for the determination of the thalamic origins of projections in the striatum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f\u2013g</a>) with finer resolution than the viral injection volume (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</a>). Strong fluorescent signal derived from fasciculated axons that originate from the thalamus and travel through the striatum to reach their cortical targets was presented in the striatum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). These axons do not form synaptic connections in the striatum, as confirmed by channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-mediated photostimulation experiments (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b\u2013d</a>), and therefore, their fluorescent signal needed to be removed. The fasciculated axons have distinct morphological features compared to the defasciculated axons which do form synaptic connections with medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b\u2013d</a>). We applied a supervised machine learning algorithm to identify these morphological features and remove the fluorescent signal from fasciculated axons (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The resulting striatal input maps were aligned to the AIBS averaged template brain (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), and thalamostriatal projections were localized using a semi-automated image segmentation method and custom-developed algorithms (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The resulting dataset describes the axonal projection patterns in the striatum that originate from individual thalamic injections (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g\u2013i</a>)."

To examine these different patterns, cortical projections within each downsampled striatal voxel were classified as one of three graded densities: dense, moderate, and diffuse projections, which were defined as over 20%, 5%, and 0.5%, respectively, of original imaging voxels containing fluorescent axons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c\u2013d</a> and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods)."

Each projection distribution was quantified in the dorsal-ventral (D-V), anterior-posterior (A-P) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>), and medial-lateral (M-L) (data not shown) axes. Each cortical subregion gave rise to a distinct projection pattern in the striatum, forming either one or two contiguous volumes. While no two projection maps were identical, some were similar. For example, the somatosensory and motor subregions, including FrA, M1/2, and S1/2, exhibit similar projection patterns, producing dense, highly overlapping projection fields in a large volume of the central portion of the striatum in the A-P axis. These projections were biased toward the lateral striatum, likely including the traditionally-termed dorsolateral domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b\u2013c</a>). In contrast, frontal subregions, including LO/VO, IL, and MO/PrL, have smaller, largely non-overlapping dense projections in the anterior, medial striatum and diffuse projections that span a larger striatal volume (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b\u2013c</a>). When injections were further grouped according to their locations in either the A-P or M-L axis, we observed a moderate trend for topographic organization in the A-P and M-L axes for the dense projections, but this was not seen for diffuse projections (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Nevertheless, even the dense projections from such grouping often resulted in several discrete, non-contiguous projection fields (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2b and e</a>), which are not as well defined as the cortical subregion-specific projection fields, as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>."

For example, Ptl, Rsp, IL, and Sub have very little projection overlap with the motor areas M1/2 or FrA.

To compare thalamostriatal projection patterns across animals, as well as to corticostriatal projections, the segmented striatum for each experiment was computationally aligned to the AIBS averaged template brain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Similar to our previous study of thalamocortical projections (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</a>), the thalamic injections were individually categorized based on their projections to a given striatal volume, such as a striatal volume innervated by a specific cortical subregion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> shows a representative example, wherein four thalamic injections are categorized based on their projection convergence with M1/2 projections in the striatum. Injections found to fulfill each category were combined and then used to derive the thalamic confidence map for the striatal subregion innervated by M1/2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g\u2013k</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for details). Each thalamic confidence map describes the likelihood that a given thalamic volume projects to a given striatal volume with a resolution finer than the size of individual injections (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This process was repeated for all cortical subregions, producing a complete map of striatal convergence for corticostriatal and thalamostriatal projections (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>)."

                                "text": "To determine if and how different portions of the striatum exhibit heterogeneity in the excitatory inputs they receive, the dense and diffuse corticostriatal projections (as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a\u2013c</a>) were summed, respectively, across all cortical subregions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The results indicate that distinct striatal subdivisions receive different numbers of converging cortical inputs and that there are distinct differences between dense and diffuse projection convergence (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013b</a>). Nearly all striatal voxels receive diffuse projection from at least five cortical subregions, with an average of 8.3 cortical inputs converging per voxel. When the striatal voxels were subdivided based on the average convergence level, two distinct subdivisions formed. A large, contiguous subdivision, constituting\u00a0~63% of the ipsilateral, is innervated by diffuse projections from a high number of cortical subregions (10.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 inputs per voxel, mean \u00b1 s.d.), and a second subdivision receiving diffuse projections from a low number of cortical subregions (6.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.84 inputs per voxel, mean \u00b1 s.d.) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013b</a>). Interestingly, when we constructed thalamic confidence maps to localize the thalamic subregions innervating the ipsilateral striatum receiving either a high (&gt;8.3 inputs) or a low (\u22648.3 inputs) level of cortical convergence, the striatal subdivision with high cortical input convergence was found to receive inputs from every thalamic nucleus shown to project to the striatum (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). In contrast, the striatal subdivision with low input convergence does not receive any input from the anterior thalamic nuclei (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). For dense corticostriatal projections, a lower level of convergence was observed (2.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 inputs per voxel, mean \u00b1 s.d.), as expected since dense projections cover a smaller volume. However, their convergence exhibits a different distribution pattern from that of the diffuse projections (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). For example, a higher level of convergence of the diffuse projections is observed in the dorsal striatum, whereas dense projection convergence is biased toward the ventral striatum (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>)."

We found that, instead of a single class, the striatal subdivision with high cortical convergence always received input from multiple cortical classes (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). Additionally, the thalamostriatal inputs that converge with each cortical class (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2b\u2013c</a>) did not mimic the thalamostriatal inputs that converge with striatal subdivisions based on high/low input convergence (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b\u2013c</a>). These results provide evidence for multimodal input integration throughout the striatum and functional heterogeneity between striatal areas having distinct diffuse and dense input convergence."

Since the above analyses indicate heterogeneity in excitatory input integration across the striatum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and cortical input patterns are thought to be stereotypic across animals, we sought to subdivide the striatum using an objective and functionally relevant approach based on corticostriatal projection patterns. The striatum was downsampled to a voxel size of 150 \u00b5m x 150 \u00b5m x 150 \u00b5m, and the projection density within each voxel was calculated for all cortical inputs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). The voxels, each treated independently, were clustered based on the input density (none, diffuse, moderate, or dense, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) they received from all cortical subregions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b\u2013c</a> and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Cortical subregions were analogously clustered based on their projections to individual striatal voxels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). To identify striatal subdivisions in an unbiased manner, four increasingly lower thresholds were applied to the voxel clustering dendrogram to generate voxel groups (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). Each voxel group was then mapped back onto the striatum (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). Notably, although no positional information was used in the clustering analysis, the resulting voxel clusters form largely contiguous volumes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>), suggesting that these voxel clusters may represent functionally distinct subdivisions."

A slightly lower threshold produced three clusters that are highly reminiscent of the three traditional striatal domains: a dorsomedial subdivision with highly convergent inputs, a lateral subdivision receiving dense sensorimotor innervation, and a ventral subdivision receiving several limbic inputs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b\u2013d</a>). Notably, the ventral subdivision contains two non-contiguous segments: a ventral segment in the anterior striatum and the most posterior segment of the striatum, suggesting that they may represent two different domains. Indeed, when the threshold was lowered to create a fourth cluster, the posterior segment became a distinct cluster (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). Although this posterior subdivision shares similarities with the limbic domain, it also receives strong auditory and visual innervation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). This posterior cluster may constitute a previously unappreciated functional subdivision of the striatum in mice. Further lowering the threshold to produce 13 clusters divided the dorsomedial subdivision, as well as a small portion of the lateral subdivision immediately adjacent to the dorsomedial subdivision, into many smaller clusters without dividing the remaining three subdivisions (see the small clusters at the dorsomedial striatum in the bottom row of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>), indicating a high degree of input heterogeneity in this region. When the threshold was lowered to produce 15 clusters, the posterior and ventral subdivisions are each separated into two clusters, where one cluster receives motor and somatosensory information and the other cluster does not (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b\u2013d</a>). Importantly, even with the low threshold generating 15 clusters, the majority of the lateral subdivision, likely corresponding to the traditional sensorimotor domain, remained as a single large cluster, suggesting a highly homogeneous functional role for this region."

Each striatal cluster, although defined by cortical inputs, receives innervations from distinct thalamic subregions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>). The thalamic inputs largely project to striatal clusters in accordance with the known thalamic nuclear groups (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3b\u2013c</a>). For example, when the striatum is divided into four clusters (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e\u2013f</a>), the dorsomedial subdivision receives input primarily from the anterior nuclear group, the ventral subdivision receives most of its inputs from the midline and medial nuclear groups, the lateral subdivision receives inputs from the ventral, intralaminar, posterior, and medial nuclear groups, while the posterior subdivision receives only weak thalamic input from the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3b\u2013c</a>). To verify that the convergent inputs to each subdivision were accurately localized, retrograde bead injections were performed in portions of the dorsomedial and posterior subdivisions (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4a\u2013b</a>). All cortical and thalamic subregions labeled by the retrograde injections were predicted by our dataset (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4c\u2013h</a>).

Furthermore, the thalamus extensively interconnects with the cortex, thereby creating a cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia circuit loop (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). To obtain a complete picture of the organization of this circuit, we overlaid the thalamic confidence map for thalamocortical projections to a given cortical subregion (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</a>) with the thalamic confidence map for thalamostriatal projections that target the striatal field innervated by the same cortical subregion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a> shows a representative example of this overlay process corresponding to the somatosensory cortices (S1/2) (see <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for all cortical subregions). When further aligning these confidence maps to the atlases, we observed that projection patterns varied across thalamic nuclei (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>).

Corticostriatal projections are shown for the cortical subregions that form primary convergent projections with the projection field of the indicated cortical subregion. Thalamostriatal projections that converge in the striatum with the projection field of the indicated cortical subregion are shown for each thalamic nucleus having\u00a0&gt;20% of its volume contributing to the convergent projections (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c\u2013d</a>). Thalamocortical projections are shown for each thalamic nucleus with\u00a0&gt;20% of its volume contributing to projections to the indicated cortical subregion (See <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>, and [<a href=\"#bib27\">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</a>]). Corticothalamic projections are shown if\u00a0&gt;20% of the thalamic nucleus received projections from the corresponding cortical subregion. Since Amyg constituted a primary convergent input to all corticostriatal projection fields, projections from Amyg were not included in corticocortical maps individually. However, the primary input to the striatal projection field is still indicated."

It has been proposed that cortical subregions whose projections converge in the striatum are more strongly interconnected than subregions that do not converge and non-converging cortical subregions are less interconnected (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yeterian and Van Hoesen, 1978</a>), which may maintain information segregation. To test the hypothesis that cortical subregions that converge in the striatum are more strongly cortically connected, the same preprocessed AIBS API datasets that were used to map the corticothalamic projections were also used to determine the density of projections between each cortical subregion. Cortical subregions whose projections converge\u00a0&gt;20% within the striatal projection fields of each other are shown in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2b\u2013p</a>.

As shown, primary convergent inputs with most cortical subregions form distributed cortical networks, for example frontal subregions IL and d/vACC are more interconnected with cortical subregions that they do not converge with in the striatum. However, some areas, such as FrA, M1/2, S1/2, and AI form highly recurrent networks with convergent subregions (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2b\u2013p</a>).

A full circuit map shows the relative levels of input convergence between cortical and thalamic subregions, as well as with the basal ganglia output targets (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>), and by focusing on connectivity related to specific subregions, information flow can be traced through the circuit (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). For example, these comparisons reveal that the motor cortex (M1/2) directly innervates, receives projections from, and converges in the striatum with all of thalamic nuclei that receive basal ganglia output. This extensive interconnectivity of the thalamic nuclei innervated by the basal ganglia with motor-related cortical and striatal subregions, particularly M1/2 and FrA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggests the importance of cortical motor information for basal ganglia function. In contrast, the orbital cortices (LO/VO) are highly interconnected with MD, VM, and, to a lesser extent, with VAL, but there are no direct corticothalamic or thalamocortical interactions between LO/VO and Pf. Thus, although LO/VO plays an important role in this circuit, it does not display the ubiquitous connectivity pattern seen with M1/2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Similarly, whereas S1/2 is interconnected with VM, Pf, and VAL, it does not send or receive MD projections directly, even though both S1/2 and MD send converging axons in the striatum (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Consistently, repetitive photostimulation (10 stimuli, 20 Hz) of the two thalamic inputs resulted in sustained Thal1 EPSCs with larger relative magnitude than those evoked by Thal2 axons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8f\u2013g</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1f\u2013g</a>). Moreover, a sustained slow current, which is evident even in singly evoked EPSCs (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>) in Thal1 inputs, but not in Thal2 inputs, contributed to an overall increased charge transfer during the consecutive photostimuli (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1g</a>). Similarly, different cortical projections to the DM striatal subdivision also exhibited heterogeneity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c\u2013g</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1b\u2013h</a>). The PPR of Vis inputs exhibited strong synaptic depression, which was not observed in d/vACC inputs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c and e</a>). Repetitive photostimulation of Vis or d/vACC inputs resulted in similar levels of synaptic depression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8f</a>, and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1f</a>). However, repetitive stimulation d/vACC, but not Vis inputs, resulted in a prominent slow sustained current that led to increased charge transfer at d/vACC\u2013DM synapses relative to Vis\u2013DM synapses over consecutive photostimuli (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8g</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1g</a>). Thus, the discrepancies observed across previous studies may be due to electrical stimulation of cortical or thalamic inputs to the striatum lacking sufficient subregion specificity. These data provide, to our knowledge, the first examples of intra-thalamic and intra-cortical heterogeneity among striatal excitatory inputs, suggesting subregion-dependent integration in the striatum."

Three of these subdivisions most likely correspond to the traditional dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and ventral domains thought to play critical roles in goal-directed behaviors, habitual behaviors, and affective control of behaviors, respectively. The fourth subdivision at the posterior end of the striatum may represent a previously unappreciated functional domain, and illustrates the existence of heterogeneity along the A-P axis. Recent evidence has suggested that the posterior part of the striatum receives inputs from anatomically distinct populations of dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Menegas et al., 2015</a>), bears a unique MSN subpopulation composition (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gangarossa et al., 2013</a>), and has been shown in primates to mediate specific behavioral functions (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yamamoto et al., 2013</a>). Our data identify and describe the distinct connectivity of the posterior striatum in mice, showing that this posterior subdivision receives strong inputs from the auditory, visual, and rhinal cortices, as well as from the amygdala, suggesting that this area may process multi-modality sensory inputs in the context of emotional information (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). We also found that the associative striatum, consistent with its proposed function, receives extremely heterogeneous inputs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). The comprehensive input map presented here may also guide future experiments aimed at understanding the function of individual cortical, thalamic, or striatal subdivisions by allowing for a systematic evaluation of all locations to perform imaging and recording experiments."

Besides geometric subdivisions, brain circuitry is also organized based on different neuronal cell types. Future studies combining cell-type-specific and subregion-specific circuit analyses to examine how subregion-specific inputs differentially innervate different cell types, for example, the D1 and D2 MSNs, in striatal subdivisions will provide additional insights into the striatal circuitry in normal and diseased brains."

Recent technical advances have made it possible to systematically generate whole brain projection data at mesoscopic resolution (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Oh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pinskiy et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zingg et al., 2014</a>). However, it remains challenging to integrate such large datasets (typically\u00a0&gt;50 terabytes) obtained from different research teams under different conditions, and with various forms of metadata. To our knowledge, our study represents the first example of combining two different large mesoscopic imaging datasets (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Our efforts were fruitful for several reasons. First, similar viral infection reagents were used, which standardized many properties of the imaging data, including comparable injection sites and high-imaging sensitivity. Second, our analyses utilize the different advantages of each dataset. For the thalamic dataset (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</a>), because the thalamic nuclei can be smaller than the size of an individual injection, high-density, overlapping injections are necessary to achieve adequate mapping resolution (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, the injections in the AIBS Mouse Connectivity Atlas dataset are sparse and mostly non-overlapping, but they are spread across many brain regions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kuan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Oh et al., 2014</a>), making them suited for mapping projections from cortical areas, which are larger, more widely spread, and better demarcated than the mouse thalamic nuclei."

We were able to expand our systematic circuit analyses to include three main brain regions that form a complete loop. Specifically, we examined how subregion-specific projections from the thalamus and the cortex converge in the striatum, and how the thalamus is interconnected with the cortex and basal ganglia (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). To do this, we carried out several analyses. First, we mapped the thalamic origins of thalamostriatal projections and identified the converging subregion-specific corticostriatal inputs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, we illustrated the relationships between the thalamic subregions that directly project to a cortical subregion and the thalamic subregions that converge with the same cortical subregion in the striatum (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is worth noting that the current thalamic dataset does not include the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei (MGN and LGN, respectively) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</a>), although reports in rat (<a href=\"#bib38\">LeDoux et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Veening et al., 1980</a>), as well as our visual inspection of AIBS thalamic injections (data not shown), suggest that the MGN, but not the LGN, projects to the posterior striatum. Third, since the thalamus is the major target of basal ganglia output, and only specific thalamic subregions receive basal ganglia innervation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deniau and Chevalier, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gerfen and Bolam, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">McFarland and Haber, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Smith et al., 2014</a>), we examined how these basal ganglia-innervated thalamic subregions differ in connectivity patterns as compared to other thalamic subregions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). We found that these thalamic subregions have strong ties with motor cortical subregions, and converge in the same striatal subdivisions with corticostriatal projections from those motor cortical subregions, consistent with the notion that the basal ganglia play a critical role in movement controls and are in close coordination with the cortical motor processing."

                        "text": "Regarding the corticostriatal inputs, the results of the present study are largely consistent with related literature in rat and primate, although several sources could potentially contribute to any discrepancy in isolated cases. First, the relative small size of mouse brain allows the systematic tracing coverage of all cortical subregions and\u00a0&gt;93% volume of the thalamus with individual injections of small (500\u2013600 \u00b5m) sizes, and the imaging of the entire projections of every injection. The level of completeness has not been previously achieved in any mammalian species. The comprehensiveness of the datasets allows us to perform quantitative analyses that are difficult with a few example images. On the other hand, because of the relative small size of mouse brain, and the lack of anatomical landmarks for demarcating certain subregions, accurately assigning cortical subregions can be challenging (e.g., for M1 and M2, see [<a href=\"#bib42\">Mao et al., 2011</a>]). For cortical injections, we applied stringent criteria (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) in the selection process and, as a result, only\u00a0&lt;10% of AIBS injections was included. Even with great care, the lack of clear landmarks for certain mouse cortical subregion definition may still be a source of variability. Second, it is important to note that there are two distinct projection patterns of corticostriatal axons, a localized dense core projection and a diffuse projection that generally spans a wider area than the dense projections (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mailly et al., 2013</a>). Many previous mapping studies preferentially focused on the dense projections, particularly when reporting a summary result of several tracing experiments. In our data, we mapped both the dense and diffuse projections, and this revealed some previously underappreciated convergence patterns, such as the diffuse somatosensory-motor inputs to a portion of the limbic striatum (mid-dark blue, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a>, 15\u00a0clusters) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Draganski et al., 2008</a>), and the widespread diffuse projections of LO/VO to nearly the entire striatal volume (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Our dense projection results are highly consistent with the corticostriatal projection distributions reported in the literature (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gruber and McDonald, 2012</a>), and studies that separate the dense and diffuse projections describe similarly widespread diffuse projections (<a href=\"#bib23\">Haber et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mahan and Ressler, 2012</a>). Finally, there might be circuit differences at mesoscopic resolution across species due to parallel evolution and it will be interesting to systematically compare them in the future when similar type of data become available in other mammalian species."

In addition to cortico-dorsal striatal projections, our study also includes cortico-ventral striatal projections, thalamostriatal projections, as well as corticocortical and thalamocortical connectivity. Our thalamostriatal dataset is of particular interest because thalamostriatal data for mouse is scarce in the literature and the circuits are much less understood compared to the corticostriatal pathways.

Therefore, we examined the existence of synaptic connections using optogenetic stimulation and physiological recording for the anatomically described corticostriatal and thalamostriatal projections (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our results indicate that, for the projections identified after computer-assisted exclusion of passing fasciculated axons, the mapped axonal projections do form functional synapses in the striatum (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and data not shown). Furthermore, taking advantage of our comprehensive anatomical input map, we examined functional heterogeneity of synaptic connections in the striatum. A series of recent studies have shown that cortical and thalamic inputs form functionally unique synapses in the striatum, although their synaptic properties remain controversial. In addition, little was known about whether different subregions within the cortex or the thalamus form functionally unique synapses in the striatum. We found that distinct cortical and thalamic subregions each give rise to synapses in the striatum with unique synaptic properties (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), providing a potential explanation for the discrepancies reported previously (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ding et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Smeal et al., 2007</a>) when the thalamic or cortical inputs were stimulated in a non-subregion-specific manner. Taken together, these results presented here demonstrate the value of creating comprehensive input maps, and their utility in guiding the effective design of functional studies."

                                "text": "Specifically, at the time our analyses were performed, the AIBS Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas contained 1029 cerebral cortex injections (<a href=\"#bib48\">Oh et al., 2014</a>) which sampled the telencephalon. Here subregions of the isocortex, hippocampus, and amygdala are all broadly defined as telencephalic cortical areas that originate developmentally from the cortical plate, and separated into neocortex (FrA, M1/2, S1/2, Vis, Ptl, and Aud), mesocortex (AI/GI/DI, Rhi/Tem, LO/VO, PrL/MO, IL, dACC/vACC, and Rsp) and allocortex (Sub and Amyg) classes. Neocortex is primarily six-layered and comprised of the primary sensory and motor cortices. Mesocortex, also called the paralimbic cortex, is generally three-layered and is made up of associative subregions in frontal cortex as well as subregions at the interface between allocortex and neocortex, such as insular and perirhinal cortices. Allocortex is the evolutionarily oldest part of cortex, and comprised of piriform cortex, hippocampus and the subiculum (<a href=\"#bib44\">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</a>). Although the amygdaloid complex has both telencephalic (pallial) and subpallial origins, it is situated within allocortex, between piriform cortex and the subiculum (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pabba, 2013</a>). Being functionally related to both the hippocampus through the limbic system and the piriform cortex with olfactory processing (<a href=\"#bib47\">Novejarque et al., 2011</a>), it was grouped here as part of the allocortex. Since that olfactory information does not project directly to the dorsal striatum and only very weakly to the ventral striatum and with olfactory tubercle not considered, olfactory areas and the piriform cortex were not included (<a href=\"#bib44\">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</a>), leaving 957 injections. This was also checked through a search for olfactory to striatal projections in the AIBS Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (data not shown). These 957 injections include both wildtype and cell-type specific cre lines, 177 of these injections are in wildtype C57BL/6J animals. However, many of the wildtype injections spanned multiple cortical subregions and had insufficient subregion specificity to map projections. Therefore, three primary sets of cre lines were also included in the search: A930038C07Rik-Tg1-Cre, Rbp4-Cre_KL100, and Cux2-IRES-Cre. The cre lines were chosen to span cortical layers 2/3 (L2/3) and 5 (L5), so as not to bias the dataset towards intratelencephalic (IT) or pyramidal-tract (PT)-type corticostriatal projections (<a href=\"#bib24\">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kress et al., 2013</a>), and contain injections in all of the cortical subregions analyzed. This added another 177 injections to the 177 wildtype injections, totaling 354 to choose from. No cortical layer 4 (L4) or layer 6 (L6) lines were chosen because they do not project to the striatum (<a href=\"#bib7\">Briggs, 2010</a>). One injection each from Etv1-CreERT2, Gpr26-Cre_KO250, and Grp-Cre_KH288 mouse lines in auditory and insular cortices were used to supplement the lack of specific L5 or L2/3 injections in the AIBS connectivity atlas for the three primary cre lines described above (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The amygdala and hippocampus were primarily targeted by wildtype injections, but also required a different set of injections from cre lines since they have different gene expression patterns from neocortex and mesocortex. The metadata for each injection identifies the primary and secondary brain areas infected, which was used as a first screening process for subregion specificity before each brain was manually evaluated for injection targeting accuracy and specificity. Some small subregions were grouped with functionally similar areas if few or no specific injections could be identified. This includes the following grouping: LO/VO, dACC/vACC, Rhi/Tem, and AI/GI/DI (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Injections specific to multiple areas within a single large subregion, such as visual and somatosensory cortices were selected to insure full coverage of the entire volume, and were analyzed as a single group (e.g., injections in VISp, VISal, VISl, and VISam for visual cortex). In the end 127 injections were found to specifically target 15 subregions that spanned all striatal projecting subregions originating from the cortical plate. All areas contain at least one wildtype, one L2/3, and one L5 injection and contain eight injections on average, with considerable variability depending on the size of the subregion, with the fewest being infralimbic (IL) with three injections and most being somatosensory cortex (S1/2) with 21 injections (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

The average template brain was rotated using these estimated angles to mimic the aberrant sectioning angle of the experimental brain. A center of mass curve was then generated from the striatum mask of this rotated average template brain, and the experimental brain sections were aligned to the rotated average template brain in the M-L and D-V axes.

To prepare the image sets for training, each image section containing striatum was background subtracted, a 12-pixel Gaussian filter was applied, and the striatum mask was used to limit the region of interest to only the striatal volume. The images were then split into single channels (red or green) and converted to an 8-bit grayscale format. The WEKA Segmentation program was manually trained to distinguish between three categories: (1) defasciculated axons that make synapses in the striatum, (2) fasciculated, or bundled axons that travel through the striatum to reach their final targets in the cortex, or (3) residual background fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3e</a>). Visually, fasciculated traveling axons could be identified as being highly directionally oriented and generally brighter than the defasciculated thalamostriatal projections, which have a diffuse, spidery appearance (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013c</a>). Since these morphological distinctions varied slightly for projections from different thalamic nuclei, separate training was required for each brain. For each channel, 3\u20136 sections (an average of 4) were used for training. The Trainable Weka Segmentation parameters were as follows; six image filters were selected, Entropy, Membrane Projections, Neighbors, Structure, and Variance. Classes were homogenized, and the other settings were left on their default values (membrane thickness: 1, membrane patch size: 19, minimum sigma: 1.0, maximum sigma: 16.0, classifier: fast random forest of 200 trees with two features per tree). Once the training was complete, the classifier was applied to the remaining\u00a0~80 sections of the brain containing the striatum, generating a probability map for each of the three features listed above, which conveys the certainty that a given pixel belonged to each of the three features. Only the defasciculated projection probability map was utilized (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3f</a>)."

                                "text": "Confidence maps, which define the thalamic origin of projections, were created to determine the likelihood that regions of the thalamus sent projections to: (1) striatal volumes that contained corticostriatal projections originating from cortical subregions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>), (2) striatal volumes that contained high- or low-diffuse corticostriatal input convergence (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>), and (3) striatal subdivisions generated by clustering voxels with common cortical input patterns (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e\u2013f</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>). To control for alignment variability (~100 \u00b5m) across thalamus masks (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</a>), an injection \u2018core\u2019 was produced by eroding the \u2018full\u2019 injection for each three-dimensional injection mask by 100 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For each injection, a positive injection core adds one to the confidence level and a positive full injection adds one (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b\u2013c,e</a>). Similarly, negative injection cores subtract one from the confidence level, and a negative full injection subtracts one. Exception: full injections were only subtracted for the two easiest to meet criteria in each grouping method (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>, arrows, and 1d), and subsequent criteria only subtract negative injection cores as one. <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> shows a simplified schematic of this process for case (1) listed above. A six level confidence map was generated by determining the inclusion of each injection in the following three groups; 10% of the diffuse target volume covered by the projection, 5% of the dense target volume covered by the projection, and 50% of the dense target volume covered by the projection (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1g</a>). Thalamic volumes occupied by the cores of injections that did not meet any of these criteria were set to zero. For cases (2) and (3), there was not projection density data, but instead binary volumes targeted by the thalamic projections, so the injection grouping was adjusted accordingly. For these groups, eight level confidence maps were created by determining the inclusion of each injection in the following four groups; 10% of the target volume covered by the projection, 10% of the projection volume within the target, 25% of the target volume covered by the projection, and 25% of the projection volume within the target. Thalamic volumes occupied by the cores of injections that did not meet any of these criteria were set to zero, and values of the final confidence maps below zero are also set to zero. The overall method was similar to that for case (1), as shown in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, except each injection is categorized based on the inclusion in each of the four groups listed above instead of the three groups shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>."

However, this does not diminish the relationship seen between the thalamus and cortex for subdivision-specific networks in the circuit, since the thalamocortical inputs are going to a primary input to the striatal subdivision, but it may account for the excess of thalamocortical projections not associated with corresponding thalamostriatal projections in these networks (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7e\u2013f</a>).

Coronal brain sections of 50 \u00b5m were produced on a vibratome and stained with 1:5000 Hoechst. Epifluorescent tiled images were made on an AxioImager N2 (Zeiss)."

This was accomplished using a combination of existing databases and new experiments. The authors combined this anatomical connectivity work with detailed computer based analyses of injection volumes, averaging of striatal volumes, and effective subtraction of fasciculated fibers of passage. These approaches were supplemented with high quality optogenetic/electrophysiogical experiments showing the location and properties of intriguing selected cortical and thalamic inputs. Overall this work represents a tour-de-force of structural and functional connectivity analysis that will be valuable to everyone studying the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits and their functions. The mapping of overlapping cortical and thalamic inputs to striatum is especially valuable. There are a few areas where data presentation might be improved, and I strongly urge the authors to think about ways that input pathways and especially convergent pathways could be represented in schematic or 3d formats that would be easier for readers to understand. There are also a few questions about some aspects of the data and some small corrections that are needed."

It might be worth revising this statement to indicate that olfactory information does not go to dorsal striatum and only weakly to ventral striatum/accumbens, but that the olfactory tubercle that has many striatal-like properties does receive this input, but will not be the subject of this study. On a related subject, Hintiryan et al. report that piriform cortex projects to ventral/ventromedial striatum, and the Allen Brain connectivity site shows a weak projection to parts of the nucleus accumbens, so perhaps statements regarding this cortical subregion should be revised."

The results here indicate much less structure in the corticostriatal projection than expected, and it may be the projection is less structured in mice than in larger animals. Both the old and new methods (and primates and mice) have their strong and weak points. It is great to cover the entire cortex. In the previous generation of this kind of work it was never possible to do more than a fragment of the cortex in any one study. The positive side of the old primate work is that cortical regions were much better defined, and the projections were seen at higher resolution. Not only are functional regions larger in primates, but it was often possible to define regions functionally, rather than only by position on the cortex. This allowed injections to be placed far from functional boundaries, and even in functional subregions (e.g. hand area of somatosensory cortex). A lesson of those old papers was that cortical regions that are close to each other might be functionally disparate and have disparate projections in the striatum. That is, although they projected to the same general area of the striatum (e.g. the somatosensory cortex recipient region), injections in the hand and foot somatosensory cortex did not have convergent projections at the microscopic level, and so did not converge on single striatal neurons. My first concern about this study is that all of those principles learned from the primate work have been jettisoned, and a strictly spatial scheme is used. Because functional areas of the cortex in the mouse are so small, it is likely that most of these injections involve very different functional cortical regions with different projections in the striatum, and are being superimposed to make the projection look less specific than it is. The same could be said about the thalamic projections. Stated differently, if the cortex or thalamus contained an affine map of function, the lost resolution in the injections could be recovered by comparing nearby injections. If it is not, then this will not work. I think the previous work suggests that it is not."

One principle proposed by previous authors was that cortical areas that are strongly connected with each other converge in the striatum (Yeterian and Van Hoesen, Brain Res, 139:43-63, 1978).

The somatosensory and motor systems are very closely connected and in the past many studies have shown that somatosensory and motor function may even overlap spatially in the cortex (of rodents). However, this does not extend to other sensory modalities. For example, visual cortex or its projections to the striatum do not go to the region called sensory by the authors. Throughout the paper, the word sensory seems specifically associated with the somatosensory cortex. I think the authors should replace the word 'sensory' in all cases in which it appears with 'somatosensory'. One thing we have learned from previous studies is that there is very little overlap between visual and somatosensory cortical projections to the striatum, and very little between visual and primary motor cortex. This is evident in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, but still, there is no recognition that Aud and Vis are sensory cortices. Their projections do not overlap much with motor cortex at all. What does this mean about the idea that all sensory input is 'sensorimotor'?"

Briefly, the cortical inputs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A_C</a>) were first used to define a striatal subdivision of interest (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-B</a>). Then we localized the thalamic origins that project to this part of the striatum in the following steps. The thalamostriatal projection in individual sections were analyzed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C-D</a>) by using the method described in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>. Thalamostriatal projections in the striatum were aligned across experimental mice as described in <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and their axonal innervation within the striatal subdivision, as defined by the cortical inputs, were determined (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E-G</a>). The aligned thalamic projections in the striatum from individual injections were then categorized (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). All injection-projection information for a given striatal subdivision was combined to derive a \u201cthalamic confidence map\u201d, which describes the thalamic subregions that innervate this striatal subdivision (example results shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H-K</a>, and methods detailed in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The confidence map for each striatal subdivision is analogous to a comprehensive retrograde tracing analysis from the striatal subdivision. Our method has the advantage that it is efficient (only computational efforts are involved after producing the original thalamic projection dataset), and allows the user to dynamically change the striatal subdivision of interests (e.g., the striatal subdivision receiving M1/2 inputs versus the subdivision receiving d/vACC inputs)."

The level of comprehensiveness in documenting thalamic projections has not been previously achieved in any mammalian species. Second, the comprehensiveness of the dataset allow us to perform quantitative analyses that are only possible with full dataset, but not with example images. For example, conventional descriptions of thalamic projections are mostly based on thalamic nucleus demarcations which, when compared to cats or primates, are less distinct and sometimes ambiguous in mice (Jones 2007, pg 52). As better stated in the textbook by Sherman and Guillery (2006), \u2018The concept of the thalamic nucleus as a single structural, functional, and connectional entity has barely survived advancing techniques and new information. We stay with the thalamic nuclei as one of our prime analytical tools because, as yet, we have little to use in its place\u2019. In our studies, we take the unique opportunity to establish nucleus-independent thalamic projection maps by using model thalamus based on averaging 70-100 mouse brains (Hunnicutt et al., 2014)."

This algorithm is the operational expression of what reviewer 3 mentioned as \u2018the lost resolution\u2026\u2026recovered by comparing nearby injections\u2019. Furthermore, our confidence maps are statistical by nature and therefore, are difficult to be compared to the traditional anatomical tracing just by numbers. For cortical injections, we integrated Allen Institute data but with strict criteria for selecting the injections within a given subregion (Methods). However, unlike in the primate literature, the definition of certain cortical subregions themselves can be controversial in mice (e.g., for M1 and M2, see Mao et al., 2011) and even with the ones that have clear functional definitions, the physical landmarks are often lacking to clearly demarcate them. We did the best practice possible by sticking to the existing mouse atlas using visible landmarks and by being consistent in injection selection process. Even with great care, the lack of sufficient demarcating landmarks may contribute to variability. We are also limited to what is available in AIBS database for cortical injections which is already the best effort available with current technology using over 1600 brains for establishing the model brain to assign the subregions. Because these cortical injections are mostly not-overlapping, we could not employ similar resolution improving algorithms as we did with thalamic injections (i.e., comparing to the neighbors). Despite these caveats, given that the mouse is an important model system for studying brain circuitry, our effort will provide a framework to examine the subregion-specific circuits in the mouse striatum."

                    "text": "Two technical notes are also important regarding why our datasets are different from certain traditional data. First, the high resolution imaging is crucial in our analyses because it allowed us to specify the portions of the striatum where there are a lack of projections, and we took consideration of the negative data (lack of projections) when localizing projection origins in the thalamus (see Methods and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, most of traditional studies do not discuss any lack of projections due to lack of full brain images, and very few studies make full projections available. The way we categorized and quantified cortical projections requires comprehensive datasets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). With such a comprehensive map, any specific element of the circuits will need to be tested functionally in the future to have a thorough comparison across species. Second, that there are two distinct projection patterns of corticostriatal axons, a localized dense core projection and a diffuse projection that generally spans a wider area than the dense projections (Mailly et al., 2013). Many previous mapping studies preferentially focused on the dense projections, particularly when reporting a summary result of several tracing experiments. In our data, we mapped both the dense and diffuse projections, and this revealed some previously underappreciated convergence patterns, such as the diffuse somatosensory-motor inputs to a portion of the limbic striatum (mid-dark blue, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, 15 clusters) (Draganski et al., 2008), and the widespread diffuse projections of LO/VO to nearly the entire striatal volume (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Our dense projection results are highly consistent with the corticostriatal projection distributions reported in the literature (Gruber and McDonald 2012), and studies that separate the dense and diffuse projections describe similarly widespread diffuse projections (Mailly et al., 2013; Haber et al., 2006)."

By lowering the clustered dendrogram thresholds, increasing numbers (we present up to 15, but the number can be more with even lower thresholds) of subdivisions can be identified and described, but most of these smaller subdivisions are associated with one primary striatal subdivision, the dorsomedial subdivision, and this is consistent with the associative function of this subdivision (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

This in turn can make it difficult in cases to evaluate whether individual injections are in and only within a claimed cortical subregion. This applied to both work. For this reason, we were very conservative in including any injections. For example, we included &lt;10% of all published AIBS cortical injections, and we did not take entorhinal as an individual group because almost all AIBS injections in this area also covered either entorhinal, perirhinal, or some of temporal cortex. We instead included entorhinal in Rhi/Tem group (subsection \u201cCorticostriatal projectome data overview\u201d, second paragraph).

This age was chosen mainly based on our experience with physiological characterizations of the thalamocortical projections with the consideration of two aspects: the technical consideration and the biological consideration. On the technical part, the cortical slices are more robust, and pyramidal neurons, especially layer 5 pyramidal neurons, are much more healthy in young adult mice compared to older mice. So, to provide cortical recordings to validate the thalamocortical projections, as we have done in Hunnicutt et al. 2014 paper, we chose the age (P14-18) that we could do consistent stereotaxic injections and after two weeks of viral infection, we could still have high success rate of cortical neuron recordings. Although the slice health is less of an issue for the striatum, we aimed the injections to accommodate both thalamocortical and thalamostriatal pathways for physiology. On the biological part, the motor and sensory areas are considered functionally and structurally matured by our time-point (P30) and this time point is widely used to investigate sensorimotor integration (e.g., Van Eden & Uylings, 1985 and Weiler et al., 2008), although the frontal area is still dynamic around this time. In our previous work (Hunnicutt et al., 2014), we tested whether there may be large rearrangements in thalamocortical projection distributions, especially the thalamo-frontal projections in young adult mice. We found that thalamocortical projections from at least 24 nuclei have reached the frontal area and form functional synapses by P30, with all frontal subregions being contacted by at least 5 thalamic nuclei. Since the frontal subregions innervated by each nucleus are comparable to those seen in the adult rat, our data suggest that the majority of thalamocortical projections to the frontal area have reached their final targets by P30 in mouse. Therefore, the behavioral changes during young adult rodents are more likely due to local refinements and synaptic pruning, rather than larger rearrangements in thalamocortical projection distributions to frontal subregions."

Similarly, we also plotted EPSC over light power for single light stimulation and repetitive light stimulation (panel B and D). Our findings regarding the functional heterogeneity of striatal inputs are relative measures obtained within each recording, namely paired-pulse ratio and relative standing current to EPSC amplitude size.

We agreed with the reviewer that the original manuscript had a gap in how we went from corticostriatal pathways to the thalamostriatal convergence. We have now added a new figure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) that walks readers step-by-step through the method by which the convergence data are derived. Briefly, the cortical inputs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A-C</a>) were first used to define a striatal subdivision of interest (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-B</a>). Then we localized the thalamic origins that project to this part of the striatum in the following steps. The thalamostriatal projection in individual sections were analyzed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C-D</a>) by using the method described in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>. Thalamostriatal projections in the striatum were aligned across experimental mice as described in <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and their axonal innervation within the striatal subdivision, as defined by the cortical inputs, were determined (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E-G</a>). The aligned thalamic projections in the striatum from individual injections were then categorized (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). All injection-projection information for a given striatal subdivision was combined to derive a \u201cthalamic confidence map\u201d, which describes the thalamic subregions that innervate this striatal subdivision (example results shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H-K</a>, and methods detailed in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The confidence map for each striatal subdivision is analogous to a comprehensive retrograde tracing analysis from the striatal subdivision. Our method has the advantage that it is efficient (only computational efforts are involved after producing the original thalamic projection dataset), and allows the user to dynamically change the striatal subdivision of interests (e.g., the striatal subdivision receiving M1/2 inputs versus the subdivision receiving d/vACC inputs). We hope this closed the missing logic gap that the reviewer was concerned about."

The results here indicate much less structure in the corticostriatal projection than expected, and it may be the projection is less structured in mice than in larger animals. Both the old and new methods (and primates and mice) have their strong and weak points. It is great to cover the entire cortex. In the previous generation of this kind of work it was never possible to do more than a fragment of the cortex in any one study. The positive side of the old primate work is that cortical regions were much better defined, and the projections were seen at higher resolution. Not only are functional regions larger in primates, but it was often possible to define regions functionally, rather than only by position on the cortex. This allowed injections to be placed far from functional boundaries, and even in functional subregions (e.g. hand area of somatosensory cortex). A lesson of those old papers was that cortical regions that are close to each other might be functionally disparate and have disparate projections in the striatum. That is, although they projected to the same general area of the striatum (e.g. the somatosensory cortex recipient region), injections in the hand and foot somatosensory cortex did not have convergent projections at the microscopic level, and so did not converge on single striatal neurons. My first concern about this study is that all of those principles learned from the primate work have been jettisoned, and a strictly spatial scheme is used. Because functional areas of the cortex in the mouse are so small, it is likely that most of these injections involve very different functional cortical regions with different projections in the striatum, and are being superimposed to make the projection look less specific than it is. The same could be said about the thalamic projections. Stated differently, if the cortex or thalamus contained an affine map of function, the lost resolution in the injections could be recovered by comparing nearby injections. If it is not, then this will not work. I think the previous work suggests that it is not.</i>"

                    "text": "The reviewer has pointed out the exact advantages and the disadvantages of the mice mesoscopic mapping. The advantages of our study in mice are two folds. First, because mouse brains are small, we were able to cover all cortical subregions and &gt; 93% volume of the thalamus with individual injections of small (500-600 \u00b5m) sizes, and image the entire projections of every injection. The level of comprehensiveness in documenting thalamic projections has not been previously achieved in any mammalian species. Second, the comprehensiveness of the dataset allow us to perform quantitative analyses that are only possible with full dataset, but not with example images. For example, conventional descriptions of thalamic projections are mostly based on thalamic nucleus demarcations which, when compared to cats or primates, are less distinct and sometimes ambiguous in mice (Jones 2007, pg 52). As better stated in the textbook by Sherman and Guillery (2006), \u2018The concept of the thalamic nucleus as a single structural, functional, and connectional entity has barely survived advancing techniques and new information. We stay with the thalamic nuclei as one of our prime analytical tools because, as yet, we have little to use in its place\u2019. In our studies, we take the unique opportunity to establish nucleus-independent thalamic projection maps by using model thalamus based on averaging 70-100 mouse brains (Hunnicutt et al., 2014). We also devoted significant effort to connect with the existing literature: for all the confidence maps presented, we overlay the confidence maps with the nucleus demarcations of both Paxinos atlas and Allen Brain atlas (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B-D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5F</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6D-E</a>,<a href=\"#fig7\">7F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B-C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).But because everything is smaller, and often time, lack of anatomical landmarks, accurately assigning the cortical subregions can be might be vague and ambiguous, and not trivial. For example, unlike in primate literature, the definition of some cortical subregions themselves can be controversial in mice (e.g., for M1 and M2, see Mao et al., 2011) and even with the ones that have clear functional definitions, their physical landmarks are lacking. Unfortunately, the boundaries of the thalamic nucleus are also much less distinct compared to the ones in the primate as mentioned above. This is indeed a common challenge in the field for mesoscopic mapping in mice at large scale. For thalamic injections, we took full advantage of the high <i>n</i> numbers we could get and used overlapping injections to dramatically increase the resolution (Hunnicutt et al., 2014). This algorithm is the operational expressing of what this reviewer mentioned as \u2018the lost resolution\u2026recovered by comparing nearby injections\u2019. For cortical injections, we did the best practice possible by sticking to the existing mouse atlas and by being consistent in selection process (that is why &lt; 10% of AIBS injections was selected into the dataset). Even with great care, the lack of clear landmarks in mouse cortical subregion definition may still be a source of variability. We are also limited to what is available in AIBS database for cortical injections which is already the best effort available with current technology with using over 1600 brains for establishing the model brain to assign the subregions. These cortical injections are mostly not overlapping with one another, so we could not employ similar resolution-improving algorithms we did with thalamic injections."

Instead, we feel that our work illustrates the exact issues (e.g., injections not confined within a given thalamic nucleus, and \u2018involving potentially different functional areas of the cortex\u2019, as the reviewer pointed out). Many of our analyses were, in fact, inspired by the primate work (e.g., work cited Graybiel and colleagues for cortical inputs and Smith and colleagues for thalamic inputs) because we had to think how to take advantage of our data and combat the disadvantages. In the meantime, mouse has become an essential model in understanding the brain circuits. We reason that providing such anatomical maps, despite possible drawbacks, is important."

First, the high resolution imaging is crucial in our analyses because it allowed us to specify the portions of the striatum where there are a lack of projections, and we took consideration of the negative data (lack of projections) when localizing projection origins in the thalamus (see Methods and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, most of traditional studies do not discuss any lack of projections due to lack of full brain images, and very few studies make full projections available. The way we categorized and quantified cortical projections requires comprehensive datasets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). With such a comprehensive map, any specific element of the circuits will need to be tested functionally in the future to have a thorough comparison across species. Second, that there are two distinct projection patterns of corticostriatal axons, a localized dense core projection and a diffuse projection that generally spans a wider area than the dense projections (Mailly et al., 2013). Many previous mapping studies preferentially focused on the dense projections, particularly when reporting a summary result of several tracing experiments. In our data, we mapped both the dense and diffuse projections, and this revealed some previously underappreciated convergence patterns, such as the diffuse somatosensory-motor inputs to a portion of the limbic striatum (mid-dark blue, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, 15 clusters) (Draganski et al., 2008), and the widespread diffuse projections of LO/VO to nearly the entire striatal volume (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Our dense projection results are highly consistent with the corticostriatal projection distributions reported in the literature (Gruber and McDonald 2012), and studies that separate the dense and diffuse projections describe similarly widespread diffuse projections (Mailly et al., 2013; Haber et al., 2006)."

One principle proposed by previous authors was that cortical areas that are strongly connected with each other converge in the striatum (Yeterian and Van Hoesen, Brain Res, 139:43-63, 1978).

Throughout the paper, the word sensory seems specifically associated with the somatosensory cortex. I think the authors should replace the word 'sensory' in all cases in which it appears with 'somatosensory'. One thing we have learned from previous studies is that there is very little overlap between visual and somatosensory cortical projections to the striatum, and very little between visual and primary motor cortex. This is evident in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, but still, there is no recognition that Aud and Vis are sensory cortices. Their projections do not overlap much with motor cortex at all.
