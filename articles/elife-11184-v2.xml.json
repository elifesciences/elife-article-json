Here, we investigated structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion using various biophysical experiments including circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Huntingtin is likely composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical \u03b1-helical solenoid where the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions fold to contain a circumscribed central cavity. Interestingly, we showed that the polyglutamine expansion increases \u03b1-helical properties of huntingtin and affects the intramolecular interactions among the domains. Our work delineates the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin, which are affected by the polyglutamine expansion, and provides an elegant solution to the apparent conundrum of how the extreme amino-terminal polyglutamine tract confers a novel property on huntingtin, causing the disease."

Here, we investigated structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion using various biophysical experiments including circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Huntingtin is likely composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical \u03b1-helical solenoid where the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions fold to contain a circumscribed central cavity. Interestingly, we showed that the polyglutamine expansion increases \u03b1-helical properties of huntingtin and affects the intramolecular interactions among the domains. Our work delineates the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin, which are affected by the polyglutamine expansion, and provides an elegant solution to the apparent conundrum of how the extreme amino-terminal polyglutamine tract confers a novel property on huntingtin, causing the disease."

Huntingtin has a segment of polyglutamine near its amino terminus (Amino-terminal) that is encoded by a polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat. If expanded above 38-residues, this mutation causes Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), a dominant neurodegenerative disorder (<a href=\"#bib1\">Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993</a>). The strong correlation between the size of the expanded repeat and the age at diagnosis of HD motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms shows that CAG repeat-size is the primary determinant of the rate of the disease progression (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brinkman et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Snell et al., 1993</a>). This biological relationship also provides a human patient-based rationale for delineating the HD disease-trigger in studies with an allelic series designed to determine the effects of progressively increasing the size of the mutation. Consistent with genetic studies in distinct CAG-expansion neurodegenerative disorders and CAG knock-in mice that replicate the HD mutation, the mechanism that triggers the disease process that leads to the characteristic vulnerability of striatal neurons in HD is thought to involve a novel gain of function that is conferred on mutant huntingtin by the expanded polyglutamine segment (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gusella and MacDonald, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Nucifora et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Trettel et al., 2000</a>)."

Huntingtin\u2019s large size and predicted predominant HEAT/HEAT-like repeat domain structure is well conserved through 500 million years of evolution (<a href=\"#bib34\">Seong et al., 2010</a>). The polyglutamine region is not conserved in some huntingtin orthologues (<a href=\"#bib34\">Seong et al., 2010</a>), implying a role as an extra feature that fine-tunes huntingtin structure and function. Indeed, testing this idea, we have previously demonstrated, with purified recombinant human huntingtins in a cell-free assay, that lengthening the polyglutamine tract quantitatively enhances the basal function of huntingtin in stimulating Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) histone methyltransferase (<a href=\"#bib34\">Seong et al., 2010</a>)."

The topology of the huntingtin solenoid is expected to reflect the specific stacking characteristics of \u03b1-helical HEAT/HEAT-like repeats that span the molecule. The shape imparted by intramolecular\u00a0stacking cannot be predicted because of the idiosyncratic nature of HEAT/HEAT-like repeats, which are loosely conserved ~34 amino acid bipartite \u03b1-helical units (<a href=\"#bib36\">Takano and Gusella, 2002</a>). Nevertheless this shape must enable modulation by the amino-terminal polyglutamine segment. It seems reasonable that this may involve some structural feature that is critical to huntingtin function. One possibility is structure-dependent post-translational modification. Human huntingtin is phosphorylated, at more than seventy modified serine, threonine and tyrosine residues (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hornbeck et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, a comparison of lines of transgenic modified <i>HTT</i> BAC mice has implicated unique amino-terminal serine phosphorylation in protection against deleterious effects of mutant huntingtin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gu et al., 2009</a>) and the polyglutamine expansion at the amino-terminal causes a trend of hypo-phosphorylation in all sites, including sites near the carboxyl-terminus (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anne et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Schilling et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Warby et al., 2005</a>), indirectly implying a long-range impact of the amino-terminal region on huntingtin structure and function."

To carry out a standardized evaluation, we performed circular dichroism (CD) analysis of a series of recombinant human huntingtins with different polyglutamine tract lengths (Q2-, Q23-, Q46-, Q67-, Q78-huntingtin, respectively) purified to homogeneity (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The CD spectra (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) of all of the huntingtins are consistent with a predominant \u03b1-helical secondary structure (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu and Rost, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Rost et al., 1994</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), with typical minima at 222 and 208 nm and a positive peak at 195 nm, and all exhibited the same irreversible thermal denaturation pattern, with secondary structure stable up to ~38\u201340\u00b0C, a gradual slow denaturation as the temperature is increased to 65\u201370\u00b0C, followed by aggregation and some precipitation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These results imply the same basic core structure and stability regardless of the size of the expanded polyglutamine segment. Plotting an average of the Mean Residue Ellipticity (MRE) at 222 nm (characteristic of an \u03b1-helix) reveals an incremental quantitative effect of lengthening the polyglutamine tract at the amino terminus on the \u03b1-helicity of the entire molecule (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

                                "text": "We then investigated the proposal that huntingtin\u2019s shape may enable a structural impact of the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract, by performing single-particle electron microscopy (EM) of recombinant human huntingtins with polyglutamine tract lengths of 23- and 78-residues. These were purified to high homogeneity using a gradient purification method with mild crosslinking (GraFix) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kastner et al., 2008</a>), collecting only the monomer fraction for analysis to eliminate potential contributions from oligomeric structures that would confound interpretation of the results (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Negative-stained micrographs of these proteins confirmed that the samples were highly homogeneous (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A total of 10,169 particles were chosen for generating 2D class averages and 30 class averages were used for reconstructing a 3D EM map of Q23-huntingtin (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). The EM map of Q23-huntingtin at about 30\u2009\u00c5 resolution, estimated from Fourier shell correlation analysis, shows that the molecule adopts an overall spherical shape with 130\u2009\u00c5 height and 100\u2009\u00c5 width (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The overall shape of huntingtin was not apparently affected either through crosslinking or by the tag as 2D class averages of huntingtin with no cross linker or without tag also showed a similar spherical shape (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The outer volume of the structure can be roughly estimated as 861,829 \u00c5<sup>3</sup> and a Mathew\u2019s coefficient (V<sub>M</sub>)\u00a0of 2.48, assuming that Q23-huntingtin is a sphere with 115\u2009\u00c5 diameter with 348\u2009kDa molecular weight. Considering the V<sub>M</sub>=1.23 for the protein itself, Q23-huntingtin appears to contain a large solvent cavity (up to 50% by volume). Consistent with this estimation, the 3D EM reconstruction of Q23-huntingtin shows a large cavity in the core (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The analysis of negatively-stained Q78-huntingtin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) disclosed a 3D map showing a similar overall spherical shape, with a large cavity in the core (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Although 3D maps were reconstructed de novo without other experimental methods such as random conical tilt, the high similarity of the shapes between Q23- and Q78-huntingtin 3D maps attests that huntingtin has the spherical structure with a cavity (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Notably, manual superimposition of the 3D maps of Q23-huntingtin and Q78-huntingtin reveals potential differences in the two structures (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), which may reflect technical variation (image processing, stain distribution, sample heterogeneity), in addition to the structural effects of the lengthened polyglutamine segment that were foreshadowed by the altered CD spectra (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

                                "text": "To further examine structural characteristics such as folding, we then assessed intramolecular interactions within huntingtin as estimated from the spatial proximity of lysine residues in sucrose-gradient-selected monomeric Q23- and Q78-huntingtin, determined by disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) cross-linking mass spectrometry (DSS XL-MS) analysis (<a href=\"#bib21\">Leitner et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Based upon the spacing between the DSS-cross-linked lysine residues in the primary sequence, the interactions that were detected for either huntingtin can be grouped into three categories, depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. These comprise: #1) short-range interactions (within a 200 amino acid interval), which seem likely to occur within the same secondary structure element, including the contacts between pairs of adjacent lysines (e.g. K174-K178 and K664-K669), and the interactions between K220, K255 and K262; #2) mid-range interactions (201 to 1000 amino acid interval), such as K826-K1559, K943-K1559 and K2548-K2934; and #3) long-range contacts (interval of &gt;1000 amino acids), including between the carboxyl-terminal K2969 and amino-terminal K943 residue. Inspection of the depiction of the short-range cross-link contact sites relative to the location of the protease-sensitive sites (<a href=\"#bib34\">Seong et al., 2010</a>) indicates that huntingtin is likely to be composed of five distinct domains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> upper panel). The location of the protease-sensitive major hinge region located at residues 1184\u20131254 defines the 150\u2009kDa amino-terminal domain (NTD) and the 200\u2009kDa carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD). A minor-protease sensitive site located at ~ residue 500 demarcates the NTD into NTD-1 and NTD-II. Interestingly, a region centrally located within the CTD showed strikingly few crosslinks, despite the presence of several lysine residues, strongly implying a distinct sub-domain that we call \u2018uncrosslinked\u2019 sub-domain (UCD), which, given the paucity of short range intramolecular contacts, may adopt a largely unfolded structure. The UCD is flanked by regions with numerous intramolecular contacts; the CTD-I in proximity to the major proteolysis site and the carboxyl-terminal CTD-II (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Consistent with the hypothesis of five discernable huntingtin sub-domains, the results of hydrophobicity analysis show a transition in hydrophobicity prediction at the edge of each sub-domain (data not shown)."

Below that is a schematic view of huntingtin with five sub-domains delineated by the shared patterns of intra-molecular interactions; two amino-terminal (NTD-I, NTD-II) and three carboxyl-terminal (CTD-I, UCD and CTD-II), as defined relative to the landmark major protease-sensitive site at ~ residue 1200 identified previously (<a href=\"#bib34\">Seong et al., 2010</a>), which is denoted by the large red arrowhead, while the secondary minor cleavage site is denoted by the small red arrowhead. The cross-links of Q46 huntingtin (Q46) identified in XL-MS analysis are also shown under the five sub-domains schematic. Lys-Lys cross-links by DSS unique to Q23-huntingtin, Q78-huntingtin and Q46-huntingtin are shown in cyan, pink, and orange, respectively in each pair-wise comparison of Q23 vs Q78 (<b>B</b>), Q23 vs Q46 (<b>C</b>) or Q46 vs Q78 (<b>D</b>).

In all three huntingtins (all red dashed arrows), NTD-I folds to contact CTD-I and CTD-II also contacts CTD-I as well as NTD-II, implying that the physical impact of the polyglutamine tract at the very amino-terminal end has the opportunity to subtly but globally alter the entire huntingtin structure and function in a polyglutamine length-dependent manner."

Specifically, NTD-I mainly interacts with CTD-I, while CTD-II interacts with NTD-II and notably with CTD-1. Thus, the pattern of mid- and long-range contacts supports a view of huntingtin folding such that the extreme amino-terminal subdomain (NTD-I), with its polyglutamine tract, and the extreme carboxyl-terminal subdomain (CTD-II) are close to each other by virtue of contacts that each makes with the NTD-II and CTD-I sub-domains that flank the major cleavage site."

However, subtraction of the 38 crosslinks common to both proteins highlight networks of contacts that are relatively specific for either Q23-huntingtin (13 crosslinks) or Q78-huntingtin (8 crosslinks), as depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. To further examine the patterns of the internal interaction depending on its polyglutamine length, we also performed XL-MS analysis of Q46-huntingtin. First, the overall contact-patterns of Q46-huntingtin were similar and consistent with the five distinct domains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> lower panel). Compared with those of Q23- and Q78-huntingtin, the unique contacts of Q46 reveal widespread interactions across the entire region of the protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a>). These unique, largely mid- and long-range contacts disclose that Q23-huntingtin exhibits more unique interactions of the NTD-I with the CTD-I, and Q78-huntingtin displays more unique contacts between the CTD-II and the CTD-I and on occasion with NTD-II. On the other hand, the unique crosslinks of Q46-huntingtin reveal that CTD-I seems to interact with both NTD-I and CTD-II as if Q46-huntingtin posits an intermediate conformation between Q23- and Q78-huntingtin. (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). These observations imply a subtle but detectable 3-dimensional structural impact of polyglutamine tract length as it increases."

Our biophysical analyses of an allelic series of native recombinant human huntingtins now provide a satisfying solution to the mystery of how the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract may be in a position to modulate huntingtin structure and function. The results of EM and XL-MS analyses provide coherent support for a HEAT/HEAT-like repeat solenoid comprising a major hinge that delimits two large nearly equal-sized domains that fold such that the ends of each arm are in close proximity and the whole circumscribes an extensive internal cavity. Other HEAT repeat proteins such as nuclear importin and exportins have functional protein-protein binding interfaces located at the inner side of the solenoid structure (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chook and Blobel, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cingolani et al., 1999</a>). Considering that the size of huntingtin is much bigger than other HEAT repeat proteins, we can imagine that the HEAT repeat domains can be folded back to form a closed structure that we have observed in huntingtin, having functional sites located in the internal cavity. This shape classifies huntingtin as a closed helical solenoid, contrasting with the shorter open curvilinear HEAT/HEAT-like repeat solenoids whose native structures have been solved at high resolution (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cingolani et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Groves et al., 1999</a>). Huntingtin\u2019s distinctive shape is predicted to provide both internal and external surface topologies that may mediate the binding of proteins or nucleic acids, as befitting a mechanical HEAT/HEAT-like repeat interaction-scaffold (<a href=\"#bib36\">Takano and Gusella, 2002</a>)."

                        "text": "Our biophysical analyses also provide basic insights for future higher-resolution studies that will be needed to more precisely delineate huntingtin structure and its modulation by the polyglutamine tract. The DSS-XL-MS intramolecular cross-linking data, together with our previously reported limited proteolysis analysis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Seong et al., 2010</a>) provide a general sense of how rod-like \u03b1-helical HEAT/HEAT-like repeat domains, may fold to delimit the closed shape that we observe. The pattern of proteolysis, regardless of polyglutamine tract length, revealed a single major cleavage-sensitive site at ~ residue 1200, strongly predicting a major hinge or pivot that roughly parses the protein into two nearly equal \u2018arms\u2019, a 150\u2009kDa NTD and a 200\u2009kDa CTD. This is supported by the patterns of short- and mid-range intramolecular DSS-XL-MS delineated intramolecular contacts that are shared by the Q23-, Q46- and Q78-huntingtin, which are mainly located within and between each of the regions that immediately flank this location, implying extensive local internal folding and close proximity of the \u2018arms\u2019 around the pivot-point. Multiple short- and mid-range interactions are also detected at the ends of the NTD-I and CTD-II. These contacts imply internal folding near the ends of each arm. Limited proteolysis of the amino-terminal domain did reveal an internal cleavage site, located at ~ residue 500, which is consistent with internal pivot points, along with other internal folding, that may explain the short- and mid-range contacts detected by XL-MS near the terminus. However, the carboxyl-terminal domain lacked internal cleavage-accessible sites (<a href=\"#bib34\">Seong et al., 2010</a>), implying a paucity of accessible hinge-points. Consistent with this, XL-MS fails to detect short- or mid-range cross-linked lysine residues in the sub-region spanning amino acids ~1800 to ~2300, except one long distance contact and one short distance contact only in Q46-huntingtin. This sub-region contains 13 lysine residues. It is possible that these residues are not DSS-accessible although we did observe DSS modified, but not cross-linked peptides in this region (data not shown), implying instead a more extended 3D structure that maximizes the surface area available for interaction with binding-partners, as in other HEAT repeat solenoid proteins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cingolani et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Grinthal et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Groves et al., 1999</a>). By contrast, the adjacent extreme C-terminus does display some internal short- and mid-range cross-linking interactions that suggest internal folding, though apparently without a well-defined proteolysis-accessible hinge-point. However, perhaps the most striking finding is the multiple long-range interaction cross-links between the CTD-II and CTD-I or NTD-II, as well as the long-range contacts of the NTD-I with the CTD-I close to the major hinge-pivot, which places the ends of each arm in close proximity to each other on the carboxyl-terminal domain arm, above the major hinge. Of note, EM analysis of the\u00a0amino-terminal FLAG-antibody-huntingtin complex strongly suggests accessibility of the extreme N-terminus, and likely the adjacent polyglutamine tract, at the external surface. Thus, folding of the two main HEAT/HEAT-like domains forms an extensive internal cavity consistent with the shape that we observe in EM analysis, while providing an elegant explanation for the conundrum of how the polyglutamine tract located at the end of the amino-terminal arm may affect change throughout the entire protein."

                        "text": "All of the huntingtins, regardless of polyglutamine tract length, appear to have the same basic core structure. Our CD data demonstrates that they are all \u03b1-helical and have the same pattern of thermal stability, denaturing over the same temperature range. They have similar shapes in EM analysis and display mostly shared DSS-XL-MS intramolecular interactions, as discussed above. Nevertheless the differences among huntingtins with different polyglutamine lengths (Q23, Q46 and Q78) are telling. Each displays a unique intramolecular interaction pattern that is most evident in the long-range contacts detected by DSS-XL-MS analysis. Q23-huntingtin features unique additional contacts between the end of the amino-terminal domain arm with the carboxyl-terminal arm, near the hinge region, whereas Q78-huntingtin is characterized by additional interactions of the end region of the carboxyl-terminal arm with itself near the hinge region, in proximity to the location of the contacts made by the end region of the amino-terminal arm, or with the amino-terminal arm near the hinge. It is intriguing that most of these unique normal and mutant huntingtin folding characteristics involve contacts at the locations on the CTD-I near the major hinge where many other contacts that are common to both proteins converge. While Q23- and Q78-huntingtin show unique crosslinks skewed toward either amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal region respectively, the wide-spread intramolecular interactions of Q46-huntingtin prompt us to hypothesize that the polyglutamine tract expansion induces subtle but progressive structural changes in huntingtin. This implies that polyglutamine tract length may subtly alter the basic structure by influencing the degree to which the end of the carboxyl-terminal arm is folded back upon itself onto the region around the major hinge: the longer the polyglutamine tract, the more are the contacts. This suggests a location of torsion or tension on the major hinge region that may be exerted by a balance between the positions of the amino-terminal end region contacts and carboxyl-terminal end region contacts. Consistent with our data, particularly including long-range interaction affected by the polyglutamine expansion, a few studies previously implied and reported the global structural and functional influence by the polyglutamine tract size: the interaction with HAP40 at the extreme carboxyl-terminus of huntingtin was influenced by the polyglutamine expansion (<a href=\"#bib25\">Pal et al., 2006</a>); the proteolytically cleaved amino-terminal fragment interacted with the carboxyl-terminal fragment of huntingtin (<a href=\"#bib9\">El-Daher et al., 2015</a>); the proximity between the first 17 residues and the polyproline region has been shown to change by the polyglutamine tract size both in exon 1 fragment and endogenous full-length huntingtin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Caron et al., 2013</a>). Perhaps huntingtin binding involves internal surface features that are accessed by a spring-loaded action of the major hinge-region that entails the end-region contacts of each arm. Importin HEAT/HEAT-like solenoid proteins undergo substantial conformational change around a hinge-pivot region upon cargo binding (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cingolani et al., 1999</a>). The impact of the polyglutamine tract on huntingtin basic structural features strongly suggests that it is possible that huntingtin may also undergo dramatic conformational change upon interaction with its binding partners."

Full-length <i>HTT</i> cDNA was cloned in two steps. First, the NcoI-XhoI <i>HTT</i> cDNA fragment (<a href=\"#bib10\">Faber et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Seong et al., 2010</a>), encoding huntingtin amino acids 1\u2013171 with varying polyglutamine tracts (Q2, 23, 46, 67, 78), was inserted between the unique NcoI and XhoI restriction sites in the modified linker. Second, the 9,046 bp XhoI-SacII <i>HTT</i> cDNA fragment from a full huntingtin cDNA clone, pBS-HD1-3144Q23 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Faber et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Seong et al., 2010</a>), encoding huntingtin amino acids 172\u20133,144 was inserted in frame using XhoI-SacII into the linker region.

The SacII site in the linker was unique because the original SacII site in pFASTBac1 vector had been removed before adding the linker. All final clones, namely pALHDQ2, pALHDQ23, pALHDQ46, pALHDQ67 and pALHDQ78 encoding full-length human FLAG-Q2-, 23-, 46-, 67- and Q78- huntingtin, respectively, were verified using full DNA sequence analysis.

A fraction containing only the monomeric huntingtin was collected and the protein was then negatively-stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 2\u2009min on 400 mesh carbon grids. Images were collected at 50,000x magnification with a defocus value of 0.5\u20131.5\u2009\u03bcm on a 4x4K CCD camera (Tietz Vieo and imaging Processing System) attached to a Jeol JEM2100F filed emission gun transmission electron microscope at 200 kV. Data were processed using EMAN2 program (<a href=\"#bib37\">Thakur et al., 2009</a>). For the huntingtin-FLAG Antibody complexes, FLAG-antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and huntingtin were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and only the antibody bound monomer of huntingtin was isolated as for huntingtin alone. Total 10,169, 9368, 4714, and 3239 particles were selected for Q23-huntingtin, Q78-huntingtin, Q23-huntingtin FLAG-antibody, and Q78-huntingtin FLAG-antibody, respectively. The selected particles were used for further processing to generate reference-free class-averages. The models were further iteratively refined with a low-pass-filter (cutoff=0.033). Four refined models were superimposed and difference maps between Q23-huntingtin, Q78-huntingtin alone and Q23-huntingtin-, Q78-huntingtin-Flag antibody complex, were calculated by Chimera (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>), respectively."

Digests of cross-linked huntingtins were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) as described (<a href=\"#bib20\">Leitner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">2014</a>). Three fractions were collected and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis on a Thermo Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer as described previously (<a href=\"#bib12\">Greber et al., 2014</a>). Cross-linked peptides were identified from the MS/MS spectra using xQuest (<a href=\"#bib39\">Walzthoeni et al., 2012</a>) with the following settings: Enzyme = trypsin, maximum number of missed cleavages = 2, cross-linking site = K and mass shifts for the cross-linking reagent DSS-d<sub>0</sub>/d<sub>12</sub>. A sequence database was constructed from an independent search of an unfractionated sample against the UniProt/SwissProt database with Mascot (<a href=\"#bib26\">Perkins et al., 1999</a>). The final database contained the huntingtin sequence and 13 identified low-level contaminants. xQuest search results were filtered according to the following criteria: mass error &lt; 4 ppm, minimum peptide length = 6 residues, delta score &lt; 0.9,% TIC \u2265 0.1, minimum number of bond cleavages per peptides = 4. An xQuest score cut-off of 17 was selected, corresponding to an estimated false discovery rate of &lt; 5%.

This study uses several approaches to examine structural features of recombinant human huntingtin. The most novel and informative studies are those using 3D EM and cross-linking followed by mass spec. While relatively crude these date provide the most informative structural data to date. Most of the work is done using huntingtin with either 23 or 78 glutamines \u2013 in a sense a range representing a broad range of allele lengths from wt to a rather long expanded allele, one that would cause juvenile HD. The extensive internal cavity is intriguing regarding potential functions of this protein. What is telling is the high degree of similarity on structure found for huntingtins with these two polyQ tract lengths. Yet subtle structural differences were seen that the authors speculate on in regards to polyQ effect on function and pathogenesis. What the authors fail to acknowledge is that the subtle changes were seen in comparing 23Q with 78Q. Much less data are provided for an intermediate allele of 46Qs \u2013 an allele representing a considerably more frequent mutant allele that leads to disease. Overall it seems that the structural effect of polyQ expansion is quite subtle, which in itself is an important finding. It would be interesting for the authors to comment on what the HTT work might imply for the other polyQ disorders."

FLAG tags are manipulated in biochemistry experiments to enhance the solubility of proteins, but they obviously cannot be innocuous with that run of charged residues to protein structure.

This is a problem with the manuscript, and the concept of the amino-terminus being important to total structure via PTMs, as the amino-terminus of mammalian huntingtin proteins has no homology to the gene annotated in insect species as huntingtin.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. The study presents the results of structural studies on full-length huntingtin using CD, 3D EM, and a mass spec/cross-linking approach. In this revised manuscript the investigators include additional data on huntingtin with 46 repeats, a repeat tract found frequently on affected alleles. Finding that huntingtin folds into a structure that consists of a large central cavity, regardless of polyQ tract length, is intriguing regarding potential functions of this large protein and effect of polyQ expansion on function. Overall this work is an important contribution to HD research and polyQ diseases in general, field where structural data are lacking. However, the manuscript still needs important revisions. We feel sorry that we have to delay further acceptance, but important advice given in the first round of revision is insufficiently addressed to allow publication without further important adaptations of the text."

There are about 100 kinases in fly, around 200 in worm, and over 500 in humans, with 13 human kinase families not seen in fly or worm (Manning et al., 2002. TIBS 27(10) pp.514-520). Thus, there is a high chance of different phospho-PTMs of a human protein expressed in insect cells. A useful reference of a study that showed only 38% similarity of PTMs from human to <i>Drosophila</i> cells: Krishnamoorthy, S. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3(8): e2877. Positively one could argue that even if these phosphorylation events are physiologically not validated, they provide proof of concept that changes in the N-terminal extension can affect posttranslational modification (PTM). This needs however follow up studies in a mammalian expression system for further validation. We suggest to the authors to consider to remove this part of the manuscript or to be at least much more careful in the claims. They should clearly mention that insect cells are not a full model for PTM in mammalian cells and that they only cover a fraction of the kinome in mammals. They also should explicitly mention the possibility of artefacts. Finally, we provide several references of papers that investigated the topic before, these papers need to be discussed in a final version. Alternatively, this part can be deleted as there remained also still serious doubts about the quality controls of the phosphoantibodies which were provided in Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5 but for which no controls on reactivity in cell extracts were provided."

Dr, Truant had not tried to detect native huntingtin with this reagent (personal communication) but our results suggest either that the N17-epitope is buried in the native full-length huntingtin structure or, alternatively that the N17-antibody epitope is formed only when the protein is denatured and assumes a non-native structure. The latter explanation seems more likely, given the accessibility of the FLAG-epitope in native FLAG-full-length huntingtin and the fact that the N17 antibody was generated to denatured N-17 peptide. In any case, the inability of the N17 antibody to bind to native full-length huntingtin precluded our ability to utilize the N17 antibody to locate the N-terminal of full-length \u2018native\u2019 huntingtin. Instead, as the reviewer suggested, we applied an additional experimental method to locate the N-terminal of huntingtin. We utilized the Ni-NTA-Nanogold for labeling His-tag located at the N-termini of Q23- and Q78-full-length huntingtins, and observed that the gold nanoparticle labeled Q23- and Q78-huntingtins, permitting the N-termini to be visualized.
