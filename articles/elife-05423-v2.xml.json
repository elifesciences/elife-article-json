However, little is known about the cellular mechanisms sperm use to gain competitive advantage or how these mechanisms are regulated genetically. In this study, we utilize a forward genetic screen in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to identify a gene, <i>comp-1</i>, whose function is specifically required in competitive contexts. We show that <i>comp-1</i> functions in sperm to modulate their migration through and localization within the reproductive tract, thereby promoting their access to oocytes. Contrary to previously described models, <i>comp-1</i> mutant sperm show no defects in size or velocity, thereby defining a novel pathway for preferential usage. Our results indicate not only that sperm functional traits can influence the outcome of sperm competition, but also that these traits can be modulated in a context-dependent manner depending on the presence of competing sperm."

One way that males try to gain a competitive edge is by producing large quantities of sperm.

Although sperm cells from a <i>comp-1</i> mutant male can migrate through the reproductive tract and fertilize eggs when other sperm are not present, in competitive situations the mutant sperm cells have difficulties migrating and are often absent from the hermaphrodite's sperm storage structure.

It thus influences a wide array of processes that affect not only the likelihood of mating, but also the probability that gametes will interact within a female to form a viable zygote. In many species, a female can mate with multiple males, resulting in competition between male ejaculates, known as sperm competition (<a href=\"#bib71\">Parker, 1970</a>). In addition, having multiple mates provides opportunities for a female to influence the outcome, known as cryptic female choice (<a href=\"#bib17\">Eberhard, 1996</a>). These post-copulatory forms of sexual selection have driven the diversification of sperm and reproductive tract morphologies as well as the divergence of reproductive proteins, and have likely contributed to reproductive isolation and speciation (<a href=\"#bib78\">Ritchie, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Howard et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Manier et al., 2013</a>)."

For example, in some species, the first male to mate may show precedence, while in others, the last mate's sperm may win, and the strength of such effects varies widely. By their nature, events in the reproductive tract that determine the outcome of competition are difficult to study, so in most cases the mechanistic basis for a particular precedence pattern is poorly understood. When sperm competition is intense, males often respond by production and transfer of numerous smaller sperm (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gomendio et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Simmons, 2001</a>). However, in some cases, sperm may gain an advantage by modulating functional traits, for example, by increasing migration velocity, promoting retention, or blocking subsequent access to the site of fertilization (<a href=\"#bib99\">Wigby and Chapman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gomendio and Roldan, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Pizzari and Parker, 2009</a>)."

The cell behaviors underlying sperm competition have only been investigated in a few species that are amenable to such analyses, and little is known about the genetic basis for differences in competitive ability among cells. However, in vivo imaging studies have recently begun to reveal the cellular mechanisms of sperm behavior in competitive contexts, where multiple males have mated with a female (e.g., <a href=\"#bib12\">Civetta, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Manier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Marie-Orleach et al., 2014</a>). For example, in <i>Drosophila</i>, analyses of genetically labeled fluorescent sperm have revealed that stored sperm are highly motile and that modulation of sperm storage, release, and ejection by the female contribute strongly to second-male precedence in that organism (<a href=\"#bib53\">Manier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lupold et al., 2012</a>). Some genetic loci that affect male reproductive success have recently been identified in <i>Drosophila</i> and in mammals (e.g., <a href=\"#bib22\">Fiumera et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Sutton et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Yeh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Civetta and Finn, 2014</a>). Specific seminal fluid components have been shown to play an important role in male competitive advantage by affecting sperm motility and storage, as well as female responses (e.g., <a href=\"#bib64\">Mueller et al., 2008</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib2\">Avila et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Simmons and Fitzpatrick, 2012</a>). However, very few examples are known of genes that function in sperm to control characteristics directly involved in sperm competition. An open question is whether genes exist that specifically regulate competition, without affecting core sperm functions, or whether competitive advantage is always gained by modulating the activity of genes involved in other processes."

                        "text": "The nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> provides a model system to address the cellular behaviors and molecular pathways that mediate sperm competition. <i>C. elegans</i> is a male-hermaphrodite species in which hermaphrodites produce their own self sperm but also can be inseminated by males. In a self-fertilizing context, hermaphrodite self sperm reside in the spermathecae, sperm storage organs where fertilization occur, and are used with very high efficiency. Typically, more than 99% of sperm go on to fertilize an oocyte (<a href=\"#bib95\">Ward and Carrel, 1979</a>). However, if mating occurs, male sperm migrate through the uterus to the spermathecae, where they encounter and must compete with stored self sperm. Importantly, during male-hermaphrodite sperm competition, male sperm are used preferentially (<a href=\"#bib95\">Ward and Carrel, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1995</a>). Male precedence is very robust, and many crosses result in male sperm exclusively fertilizing oocytes. Simple numerical advantage, seminal fluid factors, and the order of introduction into the reproductive tract have been ruled out as potential causes (<a href=\"#bib95\">Ward and Carrel, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">1995</a>). Instead, the competitive advantage of <i>C. elegans</i> male sperm has been shown to rely on intrinsic differences between male and hermaphrodite sperm cells. While the form of male and hermaphrodite sperm is the same, male sperm are generally larger than hermaphrodite sperm (<a href=\"#bib46\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1999</a>). Consistent with the idea that this is significant, experimental evolution under crossing conditions has been shown to lead to increased sperm size (<a href=\"#bib47\">LaMunyon and Ward, 2002</a>). Like those of other nematodes, <i>C. elegans</i> sperm move by crawling using a pseudopod, and this motility is required for precedence (<a href=\"#bib67\">Nelson et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Singson et al., 1999</a>). Larger sperm crawl faster in vitro (<a href=\"#bib45\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</a>), and male sperm displace self sperm from the walls of the spermathecae (<a href=\"#bib95\">Ward and Carrel, 1979</a>). However, male sperm need not fertilize oocytes to outcompete hermaphrodite sperm; mutant males whose sperm are motile, but fertilization-defective, block self progeny production even though their sperm cannot be used (<a href=\"#bib88\">Singson et al., 1999</a>). These data suggest a model for male precedence in which the presence of larger, faster, male sperm leads to the exclusion of self sperm from the fertilization process (<a href=\"#bib45\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib20\">Ellis and Stanfield, 2014</a>). Differences in the migration behaviors of male and hermaphrodite sperm could affect the processes of sperm migration towards, retention in, or localization within the spermathecae, where there could be sites especially favorable for sperm\u2013egg interaction (<a href=\"#bib28\">Han et al., 2009</a>). Although many mutants defective for spermatogenesis and/or fertilization have been identified in genetic screens, most mutations affect both male and hermaphrodite sperm equally and none specifically affect male precedence (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib68\">Nishimura and L'Hernault, 2010</a>). Thus, the underlying mechanisms, in terms of either cellular behaviors or genetic controls, remain unclear."

Strikingly, <i>comp-1</i> sperm are normal in size. However, they show defects in sperm motility and storage in vivo, coupled with context-dependent defects in pseudopodial extension in vitro. These results suggest a model in which <i>comp-1</i> functions in sperm to coordinate environmental signals that influence motility-related functions required for sperm to compete with one another. Our findings provide key insight into the genetic regulation of sperm competition and suggest that in <i>C. elegans</i>, sperm gain advantage by modulating their motility and storage depending on their competitive milieu."

After a wild-type male mates with and transfers sperm to a hermaphrodite, his sperm rapidly migrates to the spermathecae and begins fertilizing oocytes, and in ideal conditions, most crosses result in more than 90% cross progeny (<a href=\"#bib95\">Ward and Carrel, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1995</a>). However, the underlying mating and sperm transfer behaviors are variable in efficiency, so that in practice a wide range of cross-progeny frequencies are often observed, and some crosses fail altogether (<a href=\"#bib95\">Ward and Carrel, 1979</a> and unpublished observations). Thus, for our screen, we developed a sperm competition assay, using <i>spe-8; dpy-4</i> hermaphrodite recipients, that allowed us to exclude crosses for which cross progeny numbers were decreased due to behavioral defects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). <i>spe-8</i> hermaphrodites are self-sterile due to a defect in the ability to activate their self sperm to become motile (<a href=\"#bib40\">L'Hernault et al., 1988</a>). In the absence of mating, they produce no offspring. However, if a male mates with and transfers seminal fluid to a <i>spe-8</i> recipient, both the male and self sperm are activated to become motile and fertilization-competent, and since male sperm are superior, they fertilize the vast majority of oocytes (<a href=\"#bib44\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1995</a>). The <i>dpy-4</i> mutation is recessive and allows discrimination of self progeny from cross progeny on the basis of the Dumpy phenotype. For our assay, we established mating conditions in which most crosses were successful and fewer than five total Dumpy self progeny were produced in the vast majority of cases, providing a readily scored cutoff for candidate mutants (data not shown)."

For <i>C. japonica</i>, <i>C. sinica</i>, and <i>N. americanus</i>, the predicted COMP-1 proteins present in current databases were incomplete or had regions with poor similarity. In each case, examination of sequence from the <i>comp-1</i> region allowed us to generate new predicted proteins showing similarity across the full-length <i>Ce</i>-COMP-1 and the other orthologs. For <i>C. sinica</i>, we obtained sequence from the <i>comp-1</i> region, which revealed a minor assembly error in Csp5.Scaffold_00675.g14294.tt (PRJNA194557). For <i>C. japonica</i>, previous annotation (<a href=\"#bib102\">WormBase</a>) of the <i>comp-1</i> region predicted two overlapping gene models encoding proteins similar to the N and C terminus of COMP-1; our new predicted <i>Cja</i>-COMP-1 fuses JA64544 and CJA40432.

We identified one mutant, <i>me69</i>, which showed reduced male precedence as compared to the wild type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; GMS, unpublished data). The percentage of cross progeny that resulted from mating with <i>me69</i> mutant males was rarely comparable to that of wild-type crosses. However, <i>me69</i> mutant hermaphrodites produced a normal number of offspring (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), setting the <i>me69</i> phenotype apart from those of previously identified <i>spe</i> mutants, most of which were isolated based on the reduction of hermaphrodite fertility but usually affect sperm production in males as well (<a href=\"#bib68\">Nishimura and L'Hernault, 2010</a>)."

To assess precedence of <i>me69</i> males in a more natural competitive context, we performed crosses to <i>dpy-4</i> hermaphrodites, whose sperm localize appropriately to the spermathecae (data not shown). We placed individual L4 males and <i>dpy-4</i> hermaphrodites together for 40 hr and quantified self and cross progeny generated during this time period. Under these conditions, most matings with wild-type control males resulted in at least some cross progeny, and most successful males sired a high fraction of offspring (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, matings with <i>me69</i> males resulted in few or no cross progeny during the time frame of this assay. We confirmed that <i>me69</i> males were capable of mating and transferring sperm to these hermaphrodites at a high frequency (48\u201385% of crosses were successful, as compared to 74\u2013100% for wild-type), so their poor reproductive success was not simply due to behavioral defects. Rather, <i>me69</i> mutant males show post-copulatory defects in sperm usage consistent with a defect in male precedence."

It is missing three highly conserved core motifs present in active kinases, including the VAIK motif in the N lobe, the HRD motif in the catalytic loop, and the DFG motif within the activation loop, though it does contain the tripeptide APE motif located within the activation segment (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hanks et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hanks and Hunter, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Manning et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Nolen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Marchler-Bauer et al., 2011</a>). The absence of these features suggests that the protein is unlikely to have catalytic activity. The <i>me69</i> allele is predicted to result in a glycine to arginine change in a residue that is conserved in all other orthologs identified to date. COMP-1 orthologs are present in other <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species as well as in the parasites <i>Haemonchus contortus</i>, <i>Ancylostoma ceylanicum</i>, and <i>Necator americanus</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib102\">WormBase</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Laing et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Schwarz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Tang et al., 2014</a>).

To test if the <i>me69</i> and <i>gk1149</i> alleles result in a similar male precedence defect, we crossed <i>gk1149</i> males to <i>dpy</i>-<i>4</i> hermaphrodites and found that <i>gk1149</i> mutant males indeed showed a reduction in male precedence as compared to the wild type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

To confirm that loss of <i>comp-1</i> function is responsible for the male precedence defect, we performed rescue experiments.

In the standard laboratory strain of <i>C. elegans</i> (N2), sequential male matings normally show no precedence pattern, i.e., the first and second males to transfer sperm are equally likely to sire offspring (<a href=\"#bib95\">Ward and Carrel, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</a>). However, sequential matings of males from different wild-type strains can show preferential sperm usage patterns (<a href=\"#bib45\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Murray et al., 2011</a>), indicating that differences in competitive ability can occur among males in this species. To determine if <i>comp-1</i> function influences sperm competition in a male vs male context, we performed sequential matings of wild-type and/or <i>comp-1</i> males to <i>fog-2</i> mutant hermaphrodites, which fail to produce self sperm and are essentially female (<a href=\"#bib81\">Schedl and Kimble, 1988</a>). To facilitate assignment of paternity, we used strains containing a GFP transgene, <i>mIs11</i>, for either the first or second sets of crosses, and scored offspring for the presence or absence of fluorescence. In control crosses, in which two wild-type males were sequentially mated to hermaphrodites, progeny numbers from the first and second male were variable, but no consistent bias was observed, other than a weak trend in which non-<i>mIs11</i> males seemed to be slightly favored over <i>mIs11</i>-containing males (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly, in sequential matings of two <i>comp-1</i> males, no precedence order was observed. However, sequential matings of wild-type and <i>comp-1</i> males resulted in strong precedence for the wild-type sperm, regardless of whether wild-type males were the first or second mates. Notably, <i>comp-1</i> males showed full fertility in crosses to <i>fog-2</i> hermaphrodites, which lack their own sperm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These data indicate that <i>comp-1</i> males transfer normal numbers of functional sperm, which can be used efficiently when they do not need to compete. However, when other sperm are present, <i>comp-1</i> sperm show poor usage. Furthermore, the reduced usage of <i>comp-1</i> sperm is unrelated to the order of their introduction into the hermaphrodite reproductive tract. Rather, male sperm lacking <i>comp-1</i> function appear to have an intrinsic disadvantage as compared to wild-type sperm."

In particular, we wished to know if <i>comp-1</i> sperm were lost or remained active within the gonads of hermaphrodites. To address this question, we assayed the long-term kinetics of usage of <i>comp-1</i> male sperm within hermaphrodites. We crossed wild-type or <i>comp-1</i> males to <i>dpy-4</i> hermaphrodites for 16 hr, transferred the recipients at 12-hr intervals until they ceased egg laying, and counted the total number of self and cross progeny at each time point. Wild-type male sperm usage increased rapidly after mating (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), consistent with previous evidence that male sperm are used preferentially over hermaphrodite self sperm (<a href=\"#bib94\">Ward, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Ward and Carrel, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1995</a>). However, <i>comp-1</i> mutant males sired almost no progeny until late in the hermaphrodite lifespan (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Furthermore, while mating with wild-type males suppressed usage of self sperm, mating with <i>comp-1</i> males had no effect on self-progeny production (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Thus, <i>comp-1</i> males show severe long-term defects in their ability to produce offspring after mating, and hermaphrodites that mate with <i>comp-1</i> males produce a decreased number of total offspring (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). However, although they are initially unsuccessful in fertilizing eggs, at least some <i>comp-1</i> sperm are eventually used, indicating that they can remain in the reproductive tract."

To test if <i>comp-1</i> sperm can be used more rapidly when fewer self sperm are present, we aged hermaphrodites until they had used up part or all of their self sperm reservoir, then crossed them to males and assessed the short-term usage of male sperm. In crosses to 12, 24, and 36 hr post-L4 recipients, which retain moderate levels of self sperm (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>; \u201bNo. remaining sperm\u2019), the number of offspring sired by <i>comp-1</i> males increased proportionally to the age of the hermaphrodite, but success was always reduced as compared to wild-type males (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

The COMP-1 fusion proteins displayed a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm of both developing spermatids and mature sperm, where they were restricted to the cell body region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013F</a> and data not shown). These punctae were visible in sperm from both males and hermaphrodites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and data not shown). To determine whether the COMP-1 protein was localized to a specific subcellular location, we performed co-labeling experiments with the vital dye Mitotracker, a marker of mitochondria, and PEEL-1::GFP, which labels the sperm-specific membranous organelles (MOs) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Seidel et al., 2011</a>). We also examined the phosphatase GSP-3/4, which is involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and shows polarized localization within the pseudopod (<a href=\"#bib103\">Wu et al., 2011</a>). COMP-1 did not colocalize with any of these markers of sperm structure or with the sperm nucleus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013P</a>), and its absence from the pseudopod suggests that it is not involved directly with cellular locomotion, at least by modulating cytoskeletal dynamics."

Interestingly, when <i>comp-1</i> males were mated to <i>comp-1</i> hermaphrodites, mutant male sperm usage was indistinguishable from that of wild-type, suggesting that the male precedence order is regained when <i>comp-1</i> sperm compete against each other. These results indicate that <i>comp-1</i> functions to promote sperm usage not only in males, but also in hermaphrodites.

Loss of function of <i>spe</i> or <i>fer</i> genes required for spermatogenesis generally leads to hermaphrodite self sterility and male infertility, and reduction of gene function can result in partial fertility (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kadandale and Singson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Nishimura and L'Hernault, 2010</a>). We thus examined available markers of sperm morphology to determine if <i>comp-1</i> sperm harbor any general defects. Males and hermaphrodites both produce immotile, spherical spermatids that must be activated to become mature, pseudopod-bearing sperm competent for motility and fertility (<a href=\"#bib100\">Wolf et al., 1978</a>). <i>comp-1</i> mutant spermatids and sperm appear grossly normal by light microscopy (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,G</a> and data not shown). In addition, several markers of sperm structures localized appropriately in the <i>comp-1</i> mutant. As in wild-type sperm, mitochondria and membranous organelles were restricted to cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013H</a>), and the GSP-3/4 phosphatase was polarized within pseudopodia (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I\u2013L</a>). The presence of properly polarized sperm structures in mutant sperm indicates that <i>comp-1</i> is not required to complete spermatogenesis, nor is it necessary for proper localization of sperm structures in mature sperm cells. These findings are consistent with the absence of fertility or sperm usage defects in <i>comp-1</i> animals in the absence of competition."

Thus, we investigated the possibility that the precedence defects of <i>comp-1</i> males might be due to a reduction in the size of mutant sperm. To assay cell size, we measured spermatids, which are spherical, by obtaining a cross-sectional area through the center of each cell (<a href=\"#bib45\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</a>). <i>comp-1</i> mutant spermatids were variable in size, but the average and distribution of their sizes were indistinguishable from those of wild-type spermatids (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5M</a>). Therefore, we conclude that loss of <i>comp-1</i> does not reduce competitive ability by affecting cell size.

However, the shapes of <i>comp-1</i> cells were markedly different from wild-type (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013F</a> and data not shown). Quantification of pseudopod length, using an aspect ratio measurement to normalize for variation in cell size (<a href=\"#bib3\">Batchelder et al., 2011</a>), confirmed that Pronase-treated <i>comp-1</i> cells were significantly shorter than either wild-type or TEA-treated <i>comp-1</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Since Pronase-treated <i>comp-1</i> cells contained distinct cell body and pseudopod regions, with normal localization of organelles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, and data not shown), it is likely that these cells were polarized but failed to extend their pseudopods appropriately. Similar to other amoeboid cells, locomotion of nematode sperm depends on protrusion of the lamellipodium-like pseudopod, adhesion to substrate, and retraction of the cell body (<a href=\"#bib79\">Roberts and Stewart, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bottino et al., 2002</a>). Pseudopod extension defects would be expected to result in altered locomotion and/or interactions with the hermaphrodite reproductive tract, which in turn should affect migration to and occupation of the spermathecae."

While mutant sperm are used at normal levels in non-competitive contexts, they display severe usage defects in all competitive contexts. When wild-type sperm are present, <i>comp-1</i> sperm are largely absent from the spermathecae and thus are virtually excluded from opportunities to fertilize oocytes. This usage pattern leads to severe defects in male reproductive success for males as well as failure to benefit from outcrossing for hermaphrodites. Consistent with their localization defects in vivo, <i>comp-1</i> sperm have in vitro defects in pseudopodial extension that, like their usage defects, are dependent on context. Together, these phenotypes suggest a cellular role for <i>comp-1</i> in modulating the response of sperm to their environment. To our knowledge, <i>comp-1</i> is the first gene identified in <i>C. elegans</i> to specifically regulate sperm competition and one of few implicated in this process in any organism. Its pattern of conservation in related species suggests a role in male\u2013male sperm competition outside the male-hermaphrodite mode of reproduction used by <i>C. elegans</i>. Our findings demonstrate that functional traits can influence the outcome of sperm competition in <i>C. elegans</i> in a manner independent of sperm size."

To fertilize oocytes, sperm must be transferred, become motile, and migrate to the site of fertilization in response to guidance signals (<a href=\"#bib95\">Ward and Carrel, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kubagawa et al., 2006</a>). Overall fecundity depends on the number of sperm that accomplish these behaviors as well as their ability to be stored so as to ensure long-term usage (<a href=\"#bib65\">Murray and Cutter, 2011</a>). We have found that <i>comp-1</i> sperm are transferred at rates comparable to the wild type, so they achieve initial entry into the reproductive tract, but they then show varying defects in the ensuing steps (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Although <i>comp-1</i> sperm show delays in migration toward the spermathecae, at least some sperm migrate rapidly and directionally, arguing against a defect in locomotion per se. Large numbers eventually accumulate in the spermathecal region, suggesting that they respond to directional cues, but they are generally found outside the spermathecal valve. Once self-sperm stores are depleted, <i>comp-1</i> sperm concomitantly gain residency in the spermathecae and begin to fertilize oocytes. Since fertilization occurs only in these structures, it is likely that this localization defect underlies the reduced competitive ability and generally poor reproductive success of <i>comp-1</i> males."

Male sperm could thus increase their numbers in the spermathecae either by resisting removal, for example, by increasing adhesion to the spermathecal walls, and/or by migrating quickly back into the spermathecae, for example, by increasing their crawling velocity.

In some organisms, sperm may cooperate by associating with one another to promote fertility or by providing different functions within an ejaculate (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib31\">Higginson and Pitnick, 2010</a>), but neither cooperative nor detrimental interactions between sperm have been described for <i>C. elegans</i>. Some defects in localization of <i>comp-1</i> sperm are observed in the absence of competing cells; a few sperm can be found scattered throughout the uterus, though this mislocalization apparently does not lead to significant reduction in usage or loss from the reproductive tract. These findings are consistent with the migration and localization defects we observed in competitive contexts, and they indicate that <i>comp-1</i> defects are not solely induced by the presence of wild-type sperm.

Furthermore, <i>comp-1</i> activity appears to override the contribution of size, since large <i>comp-1</i> male sperm are completely outcompeted by small wild-type hermaphrodite sperm. Interestingly, the normal male precedence order is restored when both male and hermaphrodite sperm lack <i>comp-1</i> function, consistent with the idea that the size effect again predominates. Our data thus suggest that multiple activities contribute to precedence and can be independently modulated to affect sperm competitive ability. We note that a mechanism involving altering the activity of COMP-1 is likely to be less costly than production of larger sperm, which is associated with a reduced rate of sperm production (<a href=\"#bib45\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Murray et al., 2011</a>)."

                                "text": "How does COMP-1 function in sperm to alter motility-related behaviors? For crawling cells, locomotion and interaction with substrate are dependent on maintenance of polarity and extension of the lamellipodium or the pseudopod in the case of nematode sperm (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib42\">Lammermann and Sixt, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Reig et al., 2014</a>). <i>C. elegans</i> sperm are stably polarized, though the shape and size of their pseudopods is dynamically regulated (<a href=\"#bib67\">Nelson et al., 1982</a>). Markers of the cell body and pseudopod are appropriately localized in <i>comp-1</i> sperm, suggesting polarity is not disrupted. However, treatment with Pronase in vitro, which is thought to mimic the endogenous male activator (<a href=\"#bib89\">Smith and Stanfield, 2011</a>), generates activated cells with severely shortened pseudopods. The sperm cytoskeleton lacks actin and instead consists of Major Sperm Protein (MSP), which generates a network of fibers that drives cell protrusion via its expansion and contraction (<a href=\"#bib35\">Italiano et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Roberts and Stewart, 2012</a>). In the related nematode <i>Ascaris</i>, MSP filament assembly is mediated by MPOP, a pH-dependent phosphoprotein that is active at the leading edge (<a href=\"#bib48\">LeClaire et al., 2003</a>) and the soluble proteins MFP1 and MFP2 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buttery et al., 2003</a>). MSP dynamics are also governed in part by the PP1 phosphatase GSP-3/4, which localizes to the proximal pseudopod near the cell body (<a href=\"#bib103\">Wu et al., 2011</a>). Since COMP-1 localizes to the cell body, it seems unlikely to interact directly with the MSP cytoskeleton, but rather might function upstream of locomotion per se. COMP-1 contains a protein kinase-like domain, which might suggest a role in signal transduction. Like many other reproductive proteins, it represents a divergent member of its family, and its primary sequence suggests that it is unlikely to be catalytically active. However, in spite of lacking or having reduced enzymatic activity, pseudokinases have been shown to play important roles in cell signaling via interactions with active kinases or their substrates, scaffolding or tethering of signaling complexes, and other mechanisms (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib77\">Reiterer et al., 2014</a>). The punctate localization of COMP-1 within the sperm cell body is intriguing in this context."

However, measurements of cell velocity indicate that cells lacking <i>comp-1</i> are capable of wild-type crawling speeds and they eventually accumulate near their appropriate target. Therefore, it is probable that the cellular defects of <i>comp-1</i> sperm in vivo are less severe than those of Pronase-treated <i>comp-1</i> sperm, which have severely shortened pseudopods and should be nearly incapable of movement (<a href=\"#bib67\">Nelson et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1999</a>). The <i>comp-1</i> phenotype is also distinct from that caused by lack of prostaglandin cues involved in guidance toward oocytes, which leads to a severe reduction in crawling velocity along with loss of directionality (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kubagawa et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Edmonds et al., 2010</a>). Thus, <i>comp-1</i> sperm are capable of directional migration, though some aspect of sensing or responding to prostaglandins could be impaired. Alternatively, the altered localization of <i>comp-1</i> sperm could stem from decreased adhesion to the substrate, leading to a reduced ability to crawl directionally and/or maintain position within the spermathecae. Overall, the context dependence of <i>comp-1</i> sperm usage suggests that cellular defects may be limited to a subset of sperm cells or may be manifested only some of the time, for example during interaction with particular substrates within the reproductive tract. Sperm migrate across a variety of tissues including uterine and spermathecal cells and fertilized eggs, each of which could be more or less permissive for migration of <i>comp-1</i> mutant cells due to effects on either adhesion or signaling."

                                "text": "The outcome of sperm competition depends on the arena in which it occurs, which depends on the specialized reproductive biology and anatomy of the species in question. In particular, differences in the capacity of the sperm storage organ(s), functional characteristics of sperm and seminal fluid, and the degree of sperm mixing lead to distinct patterns of sperm usage (<a href=\"#bib72\">Parker and Pizzari, 2010</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i>, the spermathecae are somewhat limited as storage sites, which likely reduces the incentive for males to produce and transfer vast numbers of sperm. Instead, the arms race between the sexes leads to males producing sperm that are functionally superior. Once male sperm reach the spermathecae, they are immediately used even though they lack numerical superiority (GMS, unpublished data). Interactions between competing ejaculates can be divided into offense, the ability to displace previous sperm, and defense, the ability to block subsequent sperm. Observations of the processes of ovulation, sperm migration, and fertilization in wild-type <i>C. elegans</i>, as well as the ability of fertilization-incompetent sperm to sterilize hermaphrodites, suggest that wild-type male sperm most likely block the access of self sperm to the site of fertilization (<a href=\"#bib95\">Ward and Carrel, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Singson et al., 1999</a>). However, they fail to block the sperm of another male, as no precedence order is observed in sequential wild-type matings (<a href=\"#bib95\">Ward and Carrel, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</a>). <i>comp-1</i> male sperm lack the ability to suppress self progeny production, and they also show severe defects in male\u2013male competition whether they are the first or a subsequent mate. Thus, they appear to totally lack the offensive capabilities of normal sperm and also show defects in defense against new rivals."

Since the male\u2013female reproductive mode is ancestral (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kiontke et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cutter et al., 2008</a>), the function of COMP-1 in sperm competition most likely originated in male\u2013male competition and has been retained in androdioecious species, such as <i>C. elegans</i>, where it remains necessary for both male\u2013male and male-hermaphrodite sperm competition. Our results thus establish that <i>C. elegans</i> provides a general model to study the molecular mechanisms that underlie sperm competition as well as the interplay between the cell biology of sperm and the forces of sexual selection."

Velocity was measured in TEA-activated sperm that moved for at least 3 consecutive frames. Measurements were obtained using ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib82\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>)."

Since the K-S test requires fewer assumptions about the underlying distributions involved, we believe it is most appropriate for the majority of our data. Systematic comparison of the two tests for our data sets found that they give completely concordant results in nearly all cases; where differences in p value cutoffs were observed, the K-S actually tended to give a lower p value.

We have not quantified mating behaviors in our strains, for several reasons. 1) In experiments using mitotracker to visualize sperm, the quantity of transferred sperm, as assessed by fluorescence intensity, appears similar for wild-type and <i>comp-1</i> males, suggesting that 2) most of our assays allow us to exclude cases in which mating fails altogether: these include precedence and fertility assays using <i>spe-8, dpy-4</i> or <i>fog-2</i> recipients, male-male precedence assays, fertility time-course assays, migration assays, and counts of sperm in the spermatheca. 3) In the case of one of our assays, male-hermaphrodite precedence tests using <i>dpy-4</i> recipients, differences in mating efficiency would be expected to contribute to the magnitude of the phenotype we observe; but our conclusions do not rely on this assay alone. In summary, we believe that any effect due to mating is minor compared to the severe deficits in progeny production by <i>comp-1</i> males, which we observe even in cases where sperm transfer is directly confirmed."
