This has not only been necessary to help increase image contrast and improve imaging speed on a larger scale, but also to help computer vision research produce assisted segmentation approaches for reconstructing different features. However, with this re-invigoration of electron microscope technology, and the need for automation to reconstruct complex structures, it is important to understand how chemical fixation alters brain ultrastructure."

These paid careful attention to how different fixatives affected cell volume and preserved the ultrastructure. However, the need to consistently preserve entire organs soon led to cardiac perfusion of aldehydes, and staining with buffered osmium, which became the accepted approach for electron microscopy studies (<a href=\"#bib27\">Karlsson and Schultz, 1965</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">1966</a>), despite the tissue shrinkage it caused. The degree of shrinkage depends on differences in fixative composition, concentration (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hillman and Deutsch, 1978</a>), and region (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kalimo, 1976</a>). Shrinkage has significant implications for the measurement of parameters such as the density of structures; for example, synaptic contacts. Few studies have incorporated a shrinkage factor. Kalimo et al., adjusted for a 16% linear reduction (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kalimo, 1976</a>), and Kinney et al. 15% shrinkage along each orthogonal axis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kinney et al., 2013</a>). Any correction is typically calculated on the basis of the changes that occur during the embedding process, with the assumption that no alterations occur during the initial tissue fixation. Using rudimentary indicators such as the position of lesion sites (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sch\u00fcz and Palm, 1989</a>), or observations of how the brain filled the skull (<a href=\"#bib42\">O\u2019Kusky and Colonnier, 1982</a>), gave no precise value for how any brain region changed in volume during the preservation process. In the current study, we made quantitative analyses of fresh and chemically fixed brain tissue using discrete landmarks that allow us to assess the extent of volume changes that occur in the somatosensory cortex."

Even prior to ultrastructural brain imaging, a measurement of ionic concentrations showed that around a fifth of the tissue volume was extracellular space (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allen, 1955</a>). This was subsequently verified by various in vivo experiments, using techniques such as resistivity measurements and diffusion analysis. The amount of extracellular space varies between brain regions and the stage of development (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sykov\u00e1 and Nicholson, 2008</a>). In the neocortex of the adult rat, for example, it is 18\u201322%, and at postnatal day 4\u20137, 30% and 43%, depending on the cortical layer (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lehmenk\u00fchler et al., 1993</a>). Yet standard electron microscopy of this tissue using chemical fixation shows considerably less. This mismatch led Anton Van Harreveld to explore this phenomenon, along with alternative methods of brain fixation."

This technique revealed the physiological levels of extracellular space. Here, we have revisited this method, using high-pressure freezing to preserve tissue volumes, and comparing how the different cellular compartments are affected with chemical fixation. Ultrastructural analysis using serial section electron microscopy showed that chemically fixed tissue has a reduced volume: a significant loss of extracellular space and a decrease in the volume of neurites. However, the volume fraction of astrocytic elements increased following chemical fixation. In cryo-fixed tissue astrocytes showed a less intimate association with synapses, and their endfeet have a reduced coverage of blood vessels. Differences in membrane arrangements were also apparent at the synapse with a lower density of vesicles along the presynaptic membrane in chemically fixed synapses."

The increased synapse density after chemical fixation is consistent with the overall volume shrinkage of the neocortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Measuring the distance from the edge of spine synapses to the nearest cell membrane, showed a three times larger gap after cryo fixation compared to chemical fixation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; cryo fixation, 166 \u00b1 18 nm, N = 3 mice; chemical fixation, 53 \u00b1 5 nm, N = 3 mice; p = 2.7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>, unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test). As astrocytes are present at many synapses, where they play a role in glutamate uptake, extracellular space homeostasis, and contribute to the regulation of synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ventura and Harris, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Oliet et al., 2001</a>), we counted the proportion of spine synapses enveloped, or partially enveloped, by their processes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Astrocytic processes at these types of synapses were significantly fewer in cryo-fixed cortex (cryo fixation, 34.0 \u00b1 11.0%, N = 4 mice; chemical fixation, 62.4 \u00b1 1.9%, N = 3 mice; p = 0.008, one way ANOVA).

Cryo-fixed tissue, in which there is a greater preservation of the extracellular space, therefore, reveals larger volumes around synaptic clefts suggesting that neurotransmitters can diffuse into large volumes of extracellular fluid before encountering other cell membranes."

Type 2 synapses, later characterized as GABAergic, are distinguishable by their pre- and post-synaptic densities showing equal thickness (<a href=\"#bib56\">Uchizono, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Colonnier, 1968</a>), and their vesicles appearing flattened with darkened centres (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Measurements of the long and short diameters of synaptic vesicles at type 2 synapses in chemically fixed tissue indicate their ovoid shape (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; long diameter \u2018y\u2019, 41.0 \u00b1 5.4 nm; short diameter \u2018x\u2019, 28.2 \u00b1 3.7 nm). The glutamatergic type 1 synapses in chemically fixed tissue, in contrast, have an obvious asymmetry with larger postsynaptic densities, and round vesicles with clear centres (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; diameter y, 40.0 \u00b1 3.8 nm; diameter x, 39.1 \u00b1 3.7 nm). In cryo-fixed neocortex all synapses, on spines and dendritic shafts showed similar symmetry, and vesicle diameters indicated them all as spherical (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>; diameter y, 38.7 \u00b1 4.3 nm; diameter x, 38.5 \u00b1 4.1 nm). This suggests that the chemical fixation causes the structural changes that allow this morphological distinction to be made. To check this, and verify that it was not an effect of the dehydration and embedding process, chemically fixed samples were high-pressure frozen and embedded at low temperature, by freeze substitution (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sosinsky et al., 2008</a>). This material contained both asymmetric synapses (vesicle diameter y, 39.2 \u00b1 4.0 nm; diameter x, 38.9 \u00b1 4.8 nm) and synapses with symmetric pre- and post-synaptic densities, and flattened vesicles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; diameter y, 41.6 \u00b1 5.3 nm; diameter x, 27.7 \u00b1 3.4 nm). The hallmarks differentiating glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses would therefore appear to be induced by chemical fixation."

The difference between these two values (43% vs 38%) might be accounted for by the fact that synapses were only counted in the neuropil, whereas the cortical volume measurements are from the whole tissue that includes cell bodies and blood vessels. We also cannot rule out changes to the tissue that may occur during the freeze substitution procedure as the acetone replaces the water at low temperature prior to any fixation with the osmium."

Observations like this and many others preceded cryo-fixation studies, first undertaken by Anton Van Harreveld.

This was the first illustration of how the extracellular space rapidly disappears once the heart has stopped. More recent live imaging of fluorescent diffusion markers showed a similar reduction (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thorne and Nicholson, 2006</a>) suggesting that the process of cardiac perfusion for chemical fixation would induce a normal tissue response to anoxia resulting from the removal of the blood supply."

However, considering the total tissue volume has shrunk by 30% the neuronal portion has therefore reduced similarly to maintain the same volume fraction. The doubling of the astrocytic volume fraction after chemical fixation could reflect how this cell type reacts in the aftermath of anoxia. Oxygen depletion elicits an energy reduction resulting in ions moving down their concentration gradients, with an increase in extracellular potassium, and wholesale depolarisation and spreading depression throughout the tissue (<a href=\"#bib57\">Van Harreveld and Malhotra, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lutz, 1992</a>). The critical role that astrocytes play in buffering potassium in the extracellular space (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kofuji and Newman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Binder et al., 2006</a>) and water movement during brain ischemia (<a href=\"#bib37\">Manley et al., 2004</a>) point to these cells as playing the principal role in removing the extracellular space. The high concentrations of aquaporin transporters along their surfaces (<a href=\"#bib3\">Benfenati and Ferroni, 2010</a>) suggest that astrocytes may be responsible for the removal of extracellular water ensuring that any changes in outside environment are rapidly neutralised. Cryo fixing brain tissue at different stages after the initiation of spreading depression, or ischemia, has shown similar astrocytic morphologies to those seen after chemical fixation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Van Harreveld and Malhotra, 1967</a>)."

The perisynaptic region in chemically fixed tissue shows smaller spaces within which neurotransmitters can diffuse (<a href=\"#bib58\">Van Harreveld et al., 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ohno et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), with smaller distances between the edge of the synapse and surrounding elements. This region has variously been described at dendritic spines with a significant presence of astrocytes. In the neocortex, 60\u201370% of the bouton/spine interfaces are partially or completely surrounded with an astrocytic process (<a href=\"#bib15\">Genoud et al., 2006</a>). A similar proportion was found in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harris and Stevens, 1989</a>). The larger perisynaptic space suggested by cryo fixation to exist in vivo would give neurotransmitters a greater opportunity to diffuse more rapidly out of the synaptic cleft, into the enlarged extracellular space where there would be a greater dilution, possibly leading to a slowing of their diffusion. The enlarged perisynaptic space could effectively act as a buffer zone, reducing extrasynaptic neurotransmitter concentrations, which could help isolate synapses, reducing the possibility that their activity would influence other extrasynaptic receptors, and minimising synaptic crosstalk. However, careful computational simulations (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rusakov and Kullmann, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hrabe et al., 2004</a>) taking into account spatiotemporal dynamics, tortuosity, and binding/unbinding of neurotransmitters to various proteins (for example, glutamate transporters largely located on astrocytic membranes) are essential to gain a more detailed understanding of neurotransmitter diffusion, and how this would be affected by the differences in ultrastructure we found after cryo fixation compared to standard chemically fixed tissue. The reduced synaptic density in the cryo-fixed tissue also places them further from each other, adding to their anatomical isolation. Cryo fixation therefore appears to suggest a reduction in the influence of volume transmission revealing an ultrastructure that might favour wiring transmission (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kullmann, 2000</a>)."

Here, their endfeet completely enclose blood capillaries after chemical fixation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mathiisen et al., 2010</a>) but cryo fixation reveals a partial coverage of about two thirds (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The abluminal surface of the endothelial cell, therefore, is less insulated from the neuronal elements suggesting that solutes passing through the capillary wall from the blood have more direct access to the neurons. Conversely, substances released from neurons have greater access to blood vessels, where they might contribute to controlling blood flow (<a href=\"#bib2\">Attwell et al., 2010</a>)."

Pre-synaptically, vesicles were located further from the active zone. Images of the frog neuromuscular junction showed that chemical fixation, unlike freezing, could not prevent the fusion of vesicles to the presynaptic membrane (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heuser et al., 1976</a>). More recently, the use of high-pressure freezing, simultaneous to synapse stimulation, has revealed how the vesicles fuse and collapse into the pre-synaptic membrane within 30 ms of stimulation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Watanabe et al., 2013</a>). Analyses of vesicle arrangement in cryo-fixed CNS synapses in cultured slices (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhao et al., 2012</a>) or synaptosome preparations (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Busnadiego et al., 2010</a>) have revealed a high concentration of vesicles clustered at the pre-synaptic membrane with the lowest concentration immediately behind this zone, 50\u201370 nm further back. However, after stimulation, the lowest concentration is seen at the pre-synaptic membrane steadily increasing further away (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fern\u00e1ndez-Busnadiego et al., 2010</a>). A similar picture is seen in our comparison between chemical and cryo-fixed cortical synapses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). After cryo fixation, the greatest density of synaptic vesicles is at the pre-synaptic membrane, but after chemical fixation the vesicle density increases away from the pre-synaptic membrane suggesting that chemical fixation is unsuitable for capturing all docked vesicles."

This peak in vesicle density close to the presynaptic release site has also been seen at the calyx of Held synapse (<a href=\"#bib17\">Han et al., 2011</a>). Whether this heterogenous distribution represents different functional pools is unproven. However, a functional analysis of calyx synapses showed that disruption to the pre-synaptic protein machinery results in less vesicular release, together with a concomitant reduction in the number of vesicles seen close to the presynaptic membrane (<a href=\"#bib17\">Han et al., 2011</a>). This would support the idea that vesicles against the presynaptic membrane are docked and associated with their release machinery (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harlow et al., 2001</a>) where they can be depleted within a few milliseconds (<a href=\"#bib12\">Felmy et al., 2003</a>). This arrangement of vesicles with cryo fixation could be revealing the readily releasable pool; those aligned tightly along the membrane. And the second grouping, further back from those in a docked position may, therefore, be those of the recycling and reserve pool, immobilized and clustered together within the body of the bouton by proteins such as actin or synapsin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hilfiker et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Siksou et al., 2007</a>)."

This increases the relevance of morphological analyses by revealing an arrangement of cell membranes that more closely matches functional measurements. However, although these analyses highlight how the exquisite organization of the brain's cellular elements is acutely sensitive to chemical fixation, there are difficulties in cryo preserving large volumes of brain tissue. The high water content of the CNS appears to limit the depth to which vitrification can occur (less than 10\u201320 microns in our hands at least) before ice crystal formation causes significant damage to the structure. Large-scale preservation for ultrastructural analysis will therefore continue to rely on chemical fixation approaches."

As an alternative, to circumvent tissue shrinkage and the potential redistribution of the extracellular space and cellular processes or synaptic vesicles, the authors used high-pressure freezing of the tissue. This method is advantageous since no aldehydes are applied that cause tissue shrinkage but is disadvantageous with respect to the study of larger tissue samples. Only small tissue blocks, such as brain slices, can be subjected to high-pressure freezing. When comparing cryofixed tissue with chemically fixed tissue the authors did indeed find considerable differences."

This warming is common practice in the preparation of acute slices ready for electrophysiology experiments. Electron microscopy shows that irrespective the fixation method, both preparations show large amounts of ECS (see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2A, B, C and D</a>). Therefore, this would suggest that the removal of ECS that we see in the perfusion fixed material is not due to the fixation method itself, but rather its physiological state. If we chemically fix a slice prior to the recovery period, immediately after vibratome slicing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a>; after step 19, Studer et al., 2014) the morphology is very similar to what we find after the perfusion fixation with a reduced extracellular space. It is also the same when cryo fixation is performed 5 min after the heart has stopped, and the same as described by Van Harreveld and Khattab (1967) after spreading depression."

This observation though comes from only looking within the first 10 microns of the cryo fixed tissue (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2B</a>). We were not able to find well-preserved tissue deeper into the slice without considerable ice crystal damage (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2D</a>). We think that this is because of the excessive amounts of watery solution that surrounds the cellular elements making the tissue difficult to vitrify to any significant depth."

It is clear that we are not able to preserve slices to any significant depth with cryo fixation. We must also recognise that these slices are bathed in an artificial CSF that does not exactly replicate in vivo conditions. Therefore, our analysis would only show the fixation differences within a severely disrupted region of brain tissue in an artificial environment."

Our reasoning was that all large scale connectomics analyses of mammalian central nervous systems use chemical fixation, but to date there is little consideration for the natural state of the ultrastructure. We would like to draw the attention of the reviewers also to the recent paper by Mikula and Denk (Nature Methods, 2015), that illustrates why perfusion fixation of the brain is an important process for preserving the neural circuits of connectomics. It is therefore important to understand what changes occur to brain ultrastructure during chemical perfusion fixation, and we think our study makes important advances towards this goal."
