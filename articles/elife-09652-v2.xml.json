Yet, variability is ubiquitously observed, suggesting limits to paracrine averaging. It remains unclear whether and how biological systems may be affected by such limits of paracrine signaling. To address this question, we quantify the signal and noise of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ERK spatial gradients in response to an in vitro wound within a novel microfluidics-based device. We find that while paracrine communication reduces gradient noise, it also reduces the gradient magnitude. Accordingly we predict the existence of a maximum gradient signal to noise ratio. Direct in vitro measurement of paracrine communication verifies these predictions and reveals that cells utilize optimal levels of paracrine signaling to maximize the accuracy of gradient-based positional information. Our results demonstrate the limits of population averaging and show the inherent tradeoff in utilizing paracrine communication to regulate cellular response fidelity."

Technological advances in single-cell measurement methodologies reveal substantial cellular variability. For instance, single-cell quantification of protein concentration variability between cells shows that the concentration of many signaling molecules can vary by \u223c25% (coefficient of variation) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sigal et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bar-Even et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Spencer et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, a large and rapidly growing body of single-cell transcriptomics experiments further demonstrates that cells homogeneous in 'type' have substantially heterogeneous gene expression patterns (<a href=\"#bib24\">Junker and Van Oudenaarden, 2014</a>). The origin of this cellular variability has been traced to fundamental properties of gene expression. Notably, single-molecule kinetics regulates gene expression and, as a result, is an inherently stochastic process (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sanchez and Golding, 2013</a>)."

Functional analysis of cellular response variability demonstrates that the observed cellular variability affects the core function of signaling networks. Despite a homogenous environment, cells respond in a heterogeneous manner due to biological variability. Response variability potentially degrades transmitted information and decreases downstream effector ability to reliably respond to environmental changes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Selimkhanov et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cheong et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Voliotis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hansen and O'Shea, 2015</a>). The abundance of cellular variability throughout biological processes and the potential consequences of information degradation suggest that biological systems have developed mechanisms to regulate cellular variability. However, cellular variability is not necessarily detrimental to cellular function. In fact, cellular heterogeneity often plays a critical role in ensuring proper cellular response by mechanistically increasing the cellular response range to a constantly changing environment (<a href=\"#bib3\">Altschuler and Wu, 2010</a>). For example, single-cell noise in NF\u03baB dynamics creates robust population level responses to a wider range of inputs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hughey et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</a>)."

Overall population-level averaging decreases variability by following the statistical laws of the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers (<a href=\"#bib31\">Piras and Selvarajoo, 2014</a>). Paracrine signaling averaging can decrease variability in a similar manner, but functions on a local population level. Specifically, paracrine signaling averaging functions such that the local concentration of the paracrine ligand, or the concentration of ligand a cell is exposed to, is the average ligand concentration secreted by local cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Indeed, the benefits from paracrine communication were previously demonstrated to increase post-paracrine cellular response fidelity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rand et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shalek et al., 2014</a>). The process of local population 'information averaging' by each cell enables increased accuracy of inherently single cell decisions such as proliferation and differentiation."

EGF release from each cell is proportional to the primary response to ATP (green arrows). Due to diffusion of EGF, the local concentration will be the average of EGF released from nearby cells and subject cells in a local neighborhood to the same level of EGF (blue arrows) to result in similar ERK activation.

Paracrine communication is pervasive during initial wound response. Wound healing begins as soon as the wound occurs and the initial cellular wound response provides the foundation for proper downstream healing. The initial cellular wound response relies on external environmental cues as well as programs inherent to the cell, including DAMPs as primary danger signals (<a href=\"#bib29\">Enyedi and Niethammer, 2015</a>). DAMPs are released from necrotic cells and bind to extracellular receptors on surrounding cells. This binding initiates a signal in the surrounding cells to secrete a secondary set of cytokines and growth factors required to coordinate the wound healing process. Many DAMP signals, such as extracellular ATP, are transient and released in limited quantities. As a result, the initial wound response to such DAMPs shows high cellular variability and low fidelity. Despite the limited fidelity of the initial wound response, the wounded epithelium is able to establish a robust healing response. The complicated and multi-step wound healing process utilizes several paracrine communication mechanisms to share cellular information and coordinate the overall healing program."

Statistical analysis of the primary response signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) demonstrates that the increase in response fidelity is limited by paracrine communication distance (PCD). To analyze this pathway in the physiological context of wound response we developed a new microfluidics device to monitor the spatial propagation of initial wound response signaling. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between the wound induced spatial signaling gradient and the cellular noise pattern produces an optimal PCD. The optimal PCD balances the benefits of decreased noise from local averaging with the cost of reduced signal of the spatial signaling gradient due to over-averaging. Empirical measurements of the PCD reveal that cellular communication occurs at a distance to maximize cellular response fidelity."

This computational model quantifies the overall observed benefit of paracrine coordination and predicts the potential reduction in variability. Experimental single-cell dose response data of primary Ca<sup>2+</sup> (prior to paracrine communication) response to ATP is used as an input to predict the secondary ERK response. We quantify cellular response fidelity by using a simple signal-to-noise analysis (SNR). In this analysis the cellular response magnitude of the input ligand (signal) is divided by the cellular response variability (noise). The signal is estimated by calculating the spread between the average cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses from multiple ATP concentrations using multi-well dose response data. Noise is calculated from the average variability between cellular responses to a single input ligand concentration. SNR is simply the ratio of these two estimates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). To mimic the benefit of paracrine communication our computational model performs a local, spatially weighted average (convolution) of the primary Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to predict the variability of response post paracrine communication (ERK) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In short, the convolution averages the signal for every cell with its associated surrounding cells by weighting the surrounding cells based on a Gaussian function parameterized with varying PCDs. The PCD represents how far the paracrine molecule travels from a single-cell to activate its associated surrounding cells. Local spatial averaging provides an upper bound of the possible benefit resulting from cellular communication in conditions where no additional noise exists in the paracrine pathway. This analysis indicates that paracrine averaging using a PCD of 100\u00a0\u03bcm increases response SNR from 0.9 to 20.2 by decreasing noise, or response variability, of the predicted ERK response (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, gray/black). To investigate the limits of paracrine averaging, we repeated this analysis for multiple PCDs. Interestingly, our analysis estimates that the overall response SNR can increase up to eightyfold at PCDs of 500\u00a0\u03bcm when paracrine diffusion is not limiting, and up to twenty\u00a0fivefold when diffusion of the paracrine ligand is limiting (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). More sophisticated statistical measures, such as mutual information, produce similar results (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). The large maximal SNR benefit suggests a potentially noise-free ERK response. However, experimental measurements of ERK response fidelity shows substantial ERK variability indicating potential factors that limit the benefit gained from paracrine communication (data not shown)."

Given this role, the spatial component produced by the ATP concentration gradient and the resulting cellular positional information relative to the wound may be important in the analysis of paracrine communication that occurs over hundreds of microns from the wound. Our previous SNR analysis demonstrating an increasing SNR with increasing communication distance was done based on multi-well experiment data. However, the bolus addition of ATP creates a spatially uniform ligand concentration in the well and does not represent a physiologically relevant spatial component. To examine whether ATP spatial patterns influence the paracrine communication benefit we repeated the SNR analysis using single-cell wound response data."

Scratch-assays, where a monolayer of cells is mechanically wounded using a pipet tip, are traditionally used for epithelial cell wounding (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sholley et al., 1977</a>). Although the scratch-assay is useful for studying cell-migration following wounding, scratch-assays lack the ability to study paracrine signaling. The large volume above the cells and convection caused by the scratch present challenges to examine paracrine signaling due to the dilution and inadvertent mixing of any paracrine molecules released from a cell into the surrounding media. To circumvent these technical issues we developed a microfluidics based wounding device (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Our device has two components: an air channel (black) and a cell chamber with a \u223c2.5\u00a0\u03bcL volume (orange). The ceiling of the cell chamber has a PDMS pillar that, when air pressure is increased in the upper air channel, lowers down on to the cells, thereby wounding the cells in the cell chamber in a highly controlled and reproducible manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

The wounding device is constructed of 2 layers, a top air layer (black) and bottom cell chamber (orange). The air layer has an air hole at one end where air pressure is increased by flowing air through a small tube connected to the hole. The ceiling of the cell chamber has a PDMS pillar that is lowered down on to the cells in the cell chamber when air pressure is increased in the air layer. (<b>B</b>) Cell chamber heights were measured by loading fluorescent beads into the device and allowing them to settle on the surfaces within the device (bottom, pillar, ceiling). Height was measured by scanning the cell chamber through the Z-axis and seeing where the beads had settled based on where they were in focus (bead sharpness). Cell chamber height within the device as measured by bead sharpness revealed a chamber of approximately 60\u00a0\u03bcm in height and a distance of approximately 15\u00a0\u03bcm between the bottom of the pillar and the bottom of the cell chamber. These distances provide ample room for cell growth while still limiting the z-space in which extracellular signals can diffuse. (<b>C</b>) The change in height of the ceiling of the cell chamber (orange) and the pillar (black) with increasing air pressure as measured by bead sharpness shows controlled movement of the pillar with increasing air pressure. Although the ceiling of the cell chamber also moves with the pillar, this does not interfere with cellular wounding. (<b>D</b>) MCF-10A cells were loaded in to the wounding device cell chamber and allowed to adhere in the presence of propidium iodide (PI) to measure cell viability within the device over time in static media conditions.

(<b>E</b>) Wounding in non-static (with flow) and static (no flow) media conditions. Static media conditions were accomplished by placing a piece of tape over one of the ports of the wounding device during imaging. When flow was present, the signal went in the direction of the flow. However, when flow was not present, the signal propagated isotropically from the wound indicating that the response was a measurement of signal transfer and not simply due to the flow in the environment.

(<b>G</b>) Due to the layer-by-layer photolithography manufacture of the molds used to make the wounding device, the size of the wound can be controlled and reproducible. We were able to measure the single-cell spatiotemporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in cells wounded by a 450\u00a0\u03bcm, 300\u00a0\u03bcm, and 150\u00a0\u03bcm wound. The single-cell responses for 4 different cells at varying distances from the wound are highlighted for the 450\u00a0\u03bcm wound with colorbar indicating fold maximum increase."

Therefore, although the increase in PCD decreases response noise, the corresponding decrease in signal demonstrates the limit of PCD on the SNR benefit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The difference in rates at which the signal and noise decrease results in a maximum SNR at a PCD of 91.0+/-6.3\u00a0\u03bcm (SEM, N = 5) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). This peak corresponds to a PCD where the amount of noise is decreased to the lowest amount possible without reducing the response gradient due to \u2018over-averaging\u2019. The predicted PCD with maximal benefit did not change when we expand the model to consider limitations due to diffusion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> green curve, Materials and methods). Similar analysis using mutual information statistics shows a similar PCD with the maximal mutual information at the distance that showed maximal SNR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This analysis shows that the benefits from paracrine communication depend on how far a paracrine molecule travels which, in this specific case, has a maximal benefit at \u223c100 \u03bcm, or approximately three cell diameters."

To measure the PCD of ERK activation we first established a co-culture system that allows us to separate the effects of autocrine and paracrine signaling. Our assay utilizes a synthetic GPCR: Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD). The Gq human muscarinic derived GPCR DREADD is activated by a synthetic small molecule, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), that has no known endogenous receptors (<a href=\"#bib4\">Armbruster et al., 2007</a>). In addition, DREADD activates the Gq pathway similar to purinergic ATP receptors (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dong et al., 2010</a>). Using a co-culture of DREADD expressing (activated by CNO) and non-expressing cells (not activated by CNO), we can determine which cells release EGF (DREADD expressing-red) and which cells accept EGF (non-expressing-gray) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Using a synthetic system allows us to directly measure the average communication distance of EGF. CNO addition selectively activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in DREADD expressing cells while the surrounding non-expressing cells show no response indicating a lack of paracrine activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Although some systems show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> response can propagate from cell-to-cell through gap junctions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ross 2012</a>), this does not appear to be the case in MCF-10A cells as non-expressing cells showed no cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase upon activation of DREADD cells. Alternatively, ERK response was found in both DREADD expressing and the surrounding non-expressing cells upon CNO addition but was inhibited in both cell types in the presence of the EGFR inhibitor tryphosphitin AG1478, confirming paracrine activation of ERK in the DREADD system (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ERK responses in the DREADD system suggest that local averaging takes place only at the EGF level between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ERK response. Additionally, increasing the ratio of DREADD cells to non-expressing cells shows an increasing ERK response magnitude in non-expressing cells, further supporting that paracrine communication locally activates ERK (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

Our analysis reveals that, under these conditions, the magnitude of single-cell response fidelity increases as a function of the PCD with no upper bound. In order for cells to facilitate larger PCDs, cells would need to synthesize larger amounts of paracrine signaling molecules or utilize fast diffusing paracrine ligands like H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Enyedi and Niethammer, 2015</a>). The increased energy required to synthesize the additional molecules is likely to be minor in comparison to the overall energetic demand of a cell. Therefore cells could potentially take advantage of large PCDs to substantially mitigate biochemical noise. However, a spatially uniform input, while common in cell culture experiments, is likely an inadequate representation of physiological conditions. In the second case we analyzed the response of cells to spatially defined inputs in the form of a mechanical epithelial wound. We analyzed the cellular response to extracellular ATP gradients, a damage associated molecule, following a controlled wounding of an epithelial monolayer in vitro. Similar to developmental systems, an extracellular input ligand conveys positional information in wound response (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dubuis et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sonnemann and Bement, 2011</a>). Analysis of the paracrine communication benefit in our novel quantitative wound response assay with defined spatial perturbations demonstrates that paracrine communication increased cellular response fidelity, but with limitations. Unlike the spatially uniform ligand in the first case, the magnitude of the response fidelity benefit varies with increasing PCD. The maximal increase of cellular response fidelity occurrs at a PCD of \u223c100\u00a0\u03bcm, or approximately 3 cell diameters. In vivo work measuring ERK propagation using the same EKAREV FRET sensor also showed propagation extending \u223c100\u00a0\u03bcm (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hiratsuka et al., 2015</a>). Our results demonstrate that the paracrine information sharing benefit depends on the input ligand spatial scale, or PCD. Furthermore, empirical measurements of paracrine communication match the physiologically relevant spatial wound response maximum communication distance."

The initial steps of wound healing programs propagate information concerning the wound in a manner that is appropriate to the magnitude of damage. Both inflammatory and fibrotic processes, critical steps in wound response signaling, are damaging when they go awry. Therefore, the initial cellular responses and the establishment of signaling gradients are key steps in wound healing. The mechanistic details underlying how tissues robustly match the wound response magnitude to the extent of wound-induced damage remain unknown. Our results demonstrate that intercellular communication during the initial wound response is optimized to increase overall response fidelity and provides the initial evidence that matching the wound response to wound damage is a critical aspect to wound healing programs. Future work is needed to further investigate tissue level response fidelity during wound healing programs."

Each cell integrates information from its local neighborhood to increase its individual response fidelity. Local averaging at the cellular level is a distinct mechanism compared to the benefit of global averaging at the population level. Without any paracrine communication, the reliability of the average of a cell population response can only increase with the size of the population. This is a consequence of the central limit theorem where the uncertainty of a sample average decreases with sample size. However, this increase in reliability is only true for the population average and not for individual cells in the population. Therefore, in cases where the biologically significant output is the collective action of the population, for\u00a0example the secretion of a cytokine, intercellular information sharing is not required. However, when biologically significant output requires single-cell action, local information sharing via paracrine communication increases cellular response fidelity. Therefore, whether paracrine communication is required remains context dependent. It is possible that paracrine information sharing is more prevalent in signaling networks that support individual cellular decisions and less prevalent in cases where biologically meaningful outcomes result from population averages."

Paracrine averaging demonstrates how intercellular communication enables cellular collective decision making where the 'wisdom of the crowd' is greater than the individual cell.

The effective PCD can be regulated at the cellular level by several possible factors to optimize the benefit of paracrine communication to the specific noise and spatial patterns characteristic to each signaling system (<a href=\"#bib6\">Batsilas et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Muratov and Shvartsman, 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">2003b</a>). PCD also depends on the effective diffusion coefficient of the secreted molecule, transmitted signal strength (e.g. number of secreted molecules), and receiver cell sensitivity (e.g. receptor K<sub>d</sub>). The diffusion coefficients of paracrine signaling molecules can vary by two orders of magnitude, let alone differences in signal strength and receptor sensitivity in individual paracrine signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kreuz et al., 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gregor et al., 2007</a>).

A separate mold for both the air layer and cell layer were made using negative photoresists and masks. Chips were made by pouring uncured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) onto each mold, allowing the PDMS to harden, and bonding the layers together and subsequently to a glass slide. Cells were loaded into the devices through the inlet port using a 20G needle. During wounding the outlet port was plugged using tape and the inlet port held a reservoir of media to prevent evaporation in the chamber. Wounding was accomplished by increasing the air pressure in the top layer of the device until the pillar made contact with the bottom of the device after which the air pressure was released to raise the pillar back up. Cells were loaded in to the wounding device at a density of 15,000,000 cells/mL using a 20G needle. Following trypsinization and resuspension, cells were put on ice to prevent aggregation. Two o-rings were attached to the device surrounding both the inlet and outlet ports for media reservoirs. Each o-ring was attached using a thin film of vacuum grease. Wounding devices were kept in an empty pipet box filled with water to prevent media evaporation. Cells were allowed to adhere for 18\u201324 hr before wounding."

Even if the shift is characterized by low P\u00e9clet number, advection can interfere with positional information accuracy (as analyzed in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). To estimate the potentially degrading effects of flow we calculate the expected level of positional accuracy error induced by flow. We estimate that the wound induced signaling gradient (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) to be &gt;500 \u03bcm. Therefore the effect on positional accuracy will be minimal (&lt;10%) at advection distances up to 50 \u03bcm, or for a PCD of 100 \u03bcm, a P\u00e9clet number up to 0.5. The isocline of a P\u00e9clet number of 0.5 is shown in <a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8a</a> as a dotted black line.

The cellular response to a paracrine ligand depends on cellular decoding of the temporal paracrine concentration profile a cell observes. As both the temporal profile of the secreted paracrine molecule and the temporal cellular decoding are unknown, we consider the simple assumption of a Gaussian profile reasonable. To quantitatively test this assumption we compared the Gaussian profile to an alternative model that could be addressed analytically. In the alternative model, we assume that all paracrine molecules are released at T = 0 and that cellular decoding of the paracrine signal is simple temporal averaging.

Through single cell live imaging they quantified signal and noise of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ERK responses following treatment with ATPs (which recapitulates an event happening in wound context). They first validated the system (paracrine activation of ERK by ATP) and then they analyzed the effect of differential spatial density of cell clusters on the responses. They identified that higher density correlates with lower response variability, suggesting that paracrine communication decreases cellular variability response. To quantify the observed benefit of paracrine communication they performed a computational analysis based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This analysis showed that paracrine communication can increase the response SNR."

Applying the same computational strategy as before in a better-controlled environment, they showed again that the paracrine communication distance decreases the noise of the response. However they also identified a limit of paracrine communication, which consist in reducing the gradient magnitude."

The equations that are part of the derivation of this extended model are presented in Material and methods section: \u201cAnalysis of the effects of diffusion, secretion and integration time on paracrine communication\u201d. In this section we analytically derive key expressions that show the dependency of the Paracrine Communication Distance (PCD) on the diffusion coefficient and the ratio between the number of released molecules to the sensitivity of detection. We show under what regimes integration time could become limiting and therefore extend our model to include such limitations to the potential benefit of paracrine communication."
