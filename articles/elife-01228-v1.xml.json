Pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 plays a pivotal role in mediating cancer-related skeletal muscle degeneration. Here, we show a novel function for retinoblastoma protein (Rb), where Rb causes sarcomeric disorganization. In human skeletal muscle myotubes (HSMMs), up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and concomitant phosphorylation of Rb was induced by TNF-\u03b1 treatment, resulting in the translocation of phosphorylated Rb to the cytoplasm. Moreover, induced expression of the nuclear exporting signal (NES)-fused form of Rb caused disruption of sarcomeric organization. We identified mammalian diaphanous-related formin 1 (mDia1), a potent actin nucleation factor, as a binding partner of cytoplasmic Rb and found that mDia1 helps maintain the structural integrity of the sarcomere. These results reveal a novel non-nuclear function for Rb and suggest a potential mechanism of TNF-\u03b1-induced disruption of sarcomeric organization."

This means that Rb inhibits the ability of muscle cells to slide over one during contractions and relaxation, as happens in normal muscle tissue. If confirmed by further experiments, these results could lead to the development of new approaches for the treatment of skeletal muscle degeneration."

The underlying intercellular mechanism is currently thought to be multifactorial. Inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-\u03b1, have been shown to be key mediators of cancer-related skeletal muscle degeneration (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tisdale, 2002</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib36\">Seruga et al., 2008</a>). Elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1 precede the onset of cancer-related skeletal muscle degeneration and act through several cancer-related signaling pathways such as the p53 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathways (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guttridge et al., 2000</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2004</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib35\">Schwarzkopf et al., 2006</a>)."

To date, numerous studies of Rb function have focused on the transcriptional regulation of E2F. Rb forms a transcriptional repressor complex with two protein groups, E2F transcription factors and LXCXE motif-containing proteins (<a href=\"#bib15\">Halaban, 2005</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib5\">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</a>). Rb activity is regulated by sequential phosphorylation on several serine and threonine residues, first by cyclin D/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and then by cyclin E/CDK2 complexes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Halaban, 2005</a>). This serial phosphorylation of Rb induces dissociation of the transcriptional repressor complex, allowing expression of E2F-target genes, which are required for many cellular processes. Loss of Rb function in many cancer cells is frequently caused by aberrant CDK-mediated phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chau and Wang, 2003</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib5\">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</a>). Consequently, selective CDK inhibition is considered a potentially useful approach for cancer treatment (<a href=\"#bib27\">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009</a>). In addition, inactivation of Rb, which is induced by TNF-\u03b1 treatment, has been shown to lead to various cellular behaviors including proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rastogi et al., 2012</a>) and apoptosis of fibroblasts and aortic endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chau and Wang, 2003</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib33\">Rastogi et al., 2012</a>). Recently, a non-nuclear function of Rb has been reported; where Rb at the mitochondria participates in TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hilgendorf et al., 2013</a>). However, it is still unknown whether the Rb pathway is involved in cancer-related skeletal muscle degeneration mediated by TNF-\u03b1."

The thick filaments are composed of myosin proteins and the thin filaments are assembled from polymerized actin monomers, called filamentous actin (F-actin). The contractile activity of skeletal muscle is achieved through the actin and myosin filaments sliding past one another (<a href=\"#bib38\">Squire, 1997</a>). The motor function of striated muscle therefore, requires the well-ordered assembly of sarcomeres, which is closely tied to the highly organized actin cytoskeleton. The formins are a large family of proteins and are characterized by the presence of the conserved formin homology 2 (FH2) domain (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kovar, 2006</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib7\">Campellone and Welch, 2010</a>). The FH2 domain promotes actin nucleation and polymerization, thereby producing long straight actin filaments and regulating cytoskeletal organization. It has been reported that several members of the formin family serve as key regulators of actin dynamics during sarcomeric organization in striated muscle (<a href=\"#bib39\">Taniguchi et al., 2009</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib22\">Kan et al., 2012</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib30\">Mi-Mi et al., 2012</a>)."

During differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes (from day 0 to day 4), Rb shifted from a phosphorylated to an unphosphorylated state (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Moreover, following TNF-\u03b1 treatment Rb phosphorylation on the CDK4-specific phosphorylation site, serine 780 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kitagawa et al., 1996</a>), was induced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This was not observed on threonine 821, a CDK2-specific phosphorylation site (<a href=\"#bib15\">Halaban, 2005</a>). In untreated HSMMs, Rb was primarily present in the nucleus, but translocated to the cytoplasm after TNF-\u03b1 treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). In addition, we found that phosphorylated Rb in TNF-\u03b1-treated HSMMs was predominantly located in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In accordance with the induction of Rb phosphorylation on a CDK4-specific phosphorylation site, TNF-\u03b1 treatment led to an increase in the level of nuclear CDK4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The vast majority of nuclear Rb was in an unphosphorylated state, while cytoplasmic Rb that accumulated after TNF-\u03b1 treatment was in a phosphorylated state (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We then tested whether TNF-\u03b1-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of Rb is caused by CDK4-mediated Rb phosphorylation. When CDK4 was depleted by short hairpin RNA (shRNA), cytoplasmic accumulation of Rb induced by TNF-\u03b1 was decreased (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013H</a>). These results suggest that phosphorylation of Rb by CDK4 triggers its cytoplasmic translocation in HSMMs."

Lamina-associated polypeptide (LAP) 2\u03b1, a binding partner of nucleoplasmic A-type lamins, interacts with S780-phosphorylated Rb in mitotic myoblasts (<a href=\"#bib29\">Markiewicz et al., 2005</a>) and is known to play an important role in nuclear tethering of Rb (<a href=\"#bib28\">Markiewicz et al., 2002</a>). Indeed, when LAP2\u03b1 was depleted by shRNA in human myoblasts, Rb localized to the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Given the level of LAP2\u03b1 decreased during muscle differentiation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Markiewicz et al., 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), these results suggest that low-level LAP2\u03b1 expression in HSMMs facilitates the cytoplasmic translocation of Rb. In many types of cancer cells, Rb exists predominantly in a phosphorylated state, but is primarily localized in the nucleus.

The beating was not induced in mitotic myoblasts or prematurely differentiated myoblasts implying that the sarcomeric structure, which is essential for the contractile activity of muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Squire, 1997</a>), is organized in HSMMs. To evaluate the effect of TNF-\u03b1 on the periodic assembly of sarcomeres, we examined the distribution of \u03b1-actinin, a major component of Z-disks, as Z-disks define the lateral borders of individual sarcomeres (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gautel, 2011</a>). In untreated HSMMs, \u03b1-actinin was observed at evenly spaced intervals, whereas in TNF-\u03b1-treated HSMMs the peak-to-peak distance in line plots of \u03b1-actinin intensity along the myofibril was larger and inconsistent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>).

Rb is known to be required for myogenic differentiation but not for the maintenance of the terminally differentiated state in myotubes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Huh et al., 2004</a>). In accordance with this, sarcomeric organization was not affected when Rb was depleted by shRNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). After TNF-\u03b1 treatment, the periodic assembly of sarcomeres was disrupted in control shRNA-expressing HSMMs, but TNF-\u03b1 failed to induce the sarcomeric disorganization in sh-Rb-expressing HSMMs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013F</a>). Next, we directly examined whether cytoplasmic Rb is capable of disrupting sarcomeric organization. To this end, HSMMs were infected with adenoviruses expressing a heterologous nuclear exporting signal (NES)-fused form of Rb, which was tagged with monomeric red fluorescent protein mCherry and influenza hemaglutinin (HA) at its amino-terminus (mCherry-HA-NES Rb). Given a small population of endogenous Rb was localized in the cytoplasm after TNF-\u03b1 treatment, we expressed NES Rb at a comparable level to TNF-\u03b1-induced cytoplasmic Rb (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, asterisk vs the open arrowhead). Under this condition, sarcomeric organization was not well ordered as in TNF-\u03b1-treated HSMMs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013D</a>). When we expressed higher levels of NES Rb in HSMMs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>), the periodic arrangement of \u03b1-actinin was significantly disordered when compared to mCherry-HA-Rb-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that Rb is involved in TNF-\u03b1-induced sarcomeric disorganization and TNF-\u03b1-induced cytoplasmic Rb may have a pivotal role in this process."

In the cancer cells, Rb is phosphorylated on CDK2 phosphorylation sites as well as CDK4 phosphorylation sites, whereas our data showed that Rb phosphorylation on the CDK2-specific phosphorylation site, threonine 821, was not induced by TNF-\u03b1 treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, day 6). We therefore reasoned that the selective phosphorylation of Rb by specific CDKs affects the function of cytoplasmic Rb. Given that it has been reported that threonine 821/threonine 826 phosphorylation disrupts Rb binding to LXCXE motif-containing proteins (<a href=\"#bib25\">Knudsen and Wang, 1996</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib10\">Dick and Rubin, 2013</a>), we examined whether the function of cytoplasmic Rb is achieved through its interaction with LXCXE motif-containing proteins.

Among the proteins identified, we focused on mammalian diaphanous-related formin 1 (mDia1), a potent actin nucleation factor (<a href=\"#bib44\">Watanabe et al., 199<i>7</i></a>), as the LXCXE motif is contained in the GTPase binding domain (GBD) of mDia1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). It is noteworthy that the band including mDia1 was hardly detected in mCherry-HA-NES Rb \u0394exon 22-expressing HSMMs (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, band 1). Data from purified wild-type and LXCXE motif-deleted mutant mDia1 proteins (WT and \u0394LXCXE) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) showed that binding of mDia1 to Rb was abolished by deletion of the LXCXE motif (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Cytoplasmic Rb, which was phosphorylated and accumulated after TNF-\u03b1 treatment, interacted with mDia1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). We then examined whether the selective phosphorylation of Rb affects this interaction. Unphosphorylated Rb protein containing the large pocket, an important domain for interactions with a variety of cellular proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</a>), bound to mDia1 in vitro and the binding level was strongly reduced according to its phosphorylation catalyzed by cyclin D/CDK4 and cyclin E/CDK2 complexes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>). Although differences in the patterns of Rb phosphorylation by cyclin D/CDK4 and cyclin E/CDK2 have been reported, we failed to detect the selective phosphorylation of Rb by our in vitro phosphorylation system, which may be due to a supraphysiological activity of CDKs in vitro. We then tested a mutant Rb protein bearing serine/threonine-to-alanine substitutions in the CDK2-specific phosphorylation sites, serine 612 and threonine 821 (Mut CDK2). The mutant Rb exhibited substantial interaction with mDia1 even after phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>), suggesting that phosphorylation of Rb on CDK4 phosphorylation sites alone does not impair its interaction with mDia1 and TNF-\u03b1-induced cytoplasmic Rb has the potential to interact with mDia1."

TNF-\u03b1 induces CDK4 activation and the concomitant phosphorylation of Rb. Subsequently, cytoplasmic translocation of Rb is triggered. Cytoplasmic Rb disrupts sarcomeric organization, which may be caused by dysfunction of mDia1. The precise role of mDia1 in the regulation of sarcomeric organization is poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sparrow and Schock, 2009</a>), but the contribution of mDia1 to sarcomeric organization is supported. When mDia1 was depleted by shRNA, the lateral periodicity in the distribution of \u03b1-actinin was markedly perturbed (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>). The importance of actin nucleation factors for the periodic assembly of sarcomeres is proposed by the recent observations that depletion of actin nucleation factors, such as Fhod3 and leiomodin, results in disordered \u03b1-actinin distribution in cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chereau et al., 2008</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib39\">Taniguchi et al., 2009</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib20\">Iskratsch et al., 2010</a>).

TNF-\u03b1-induced skeletal muscle degeneration is achieved through multiple mechanisms. The results presented in this study propose a novel non-nuclear function for Rb, which is independent of the transcriptional regulation of E2F and may be involved in TNF-\u03b1-induced skeletal muscle degeneration.

As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, the vast majority of the exogenous Rb proteins were localized in the nucleus (mCherry-HA-Rb) and the cytoplasm (mCherry-HA-NES Rb). These proteins can therefore be used for the nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, asterisk) and the reliability of our subcellular fractionation experiments are supported as these exogenous Rb proteins properly fractionated into the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. We confirmed that in untreated HSMMs, Rb was primarily present in the nucleus and phosphorylated Rb accumulated in the cytoplasm after TNF-\u03b1 treatment. In addition, we have verified the specificity of Rb antibodies used in immunofluorescence microscopy. The epifluorescence microscopy data clearly shows that the immunofluorescence signal of these antibodies was significantly weakened in Rb knocked down HSMMs (new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The information regarding epifluorescence microscopy has been now included in the Materials and methods section."

Our new data suggests endogenous Rb contributes to TNF-\u03b1-induced sarcomeric disorganization because TNF-\u03b1 failed to induce sarcomeric disorganization in Rb knocked down HSMMs (new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; see also author response 4). In addition, given that Rb phosphorylation was partially induced by TNF-\u03b1 treatment and a small population of endogenous Rb was localized in the cytoplasm, we have examined whether TNF-\u03b1-induced cytoplasmic Rb is sufficient for the biological function of Rb in the cytoplasm. To address this issue, we have expressed a NES-fused form of Rb at a comparable level to TNF-\u03b1-induced cytoplasmic Rb (new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, asterisk versus the open arrowhead). Under this condition, the repeating pattern of \u03b1-actinin distribution was disrupted (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013D</a>), which was the same as TNF-\u03b1-treated HSMMs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013E</a>). These results suggest that TNF-\u03b1-induced phosphorylation of Rb yields sufficient cytoplasmic accumulation of Rb, which may have a pivotal role in TNF-\u03b1-induced sarcomeric disorganization."

The lists of identified proteins are also shown. Sarcomeric disorganization was induced by NES Rb wild-type, but not by NES Rb lacking exon 22. Because the exon 22-deleted mutant Rb is known to be an LXCXE-binding deficient mutant, we hypothesized that the function of cytoplasmic Rb is rendered through its interaction with LXCXE motif-containing proteins. This critical point was therefore addressed, as highlighted by the title of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. Among the proteins identified (\u223c27 proteins), we focused on mDia1 (DIAPH1) because only mDia1 contains the LXCXE motif. In addition, \u201cit is noteworthy that the band including mDia1 was hardly detected in mCherry-HA-NES Rb \u0394exon 22-expressing HSMMs (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, band 1).\u201d This sentence has been now included in the Results section of our revised manuscript because it further supports our idea that mDia1 is a candidate of NES Rb-binding protein and is involved in the function of NES Rb WT."

The sequence for sh-Rb was added to the Materials and methods section. As shown in new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013F</a>, TNF-\u03b1-induced sarcomeric disorganization was attenuated in sh-Rb-expressing HSMMs when compared to control shRNA-expressing HSMMs. These results support our idea that TNF-\u03b1-induced cytoplasmic Rb is important for TNF-\u03b1-induced sarcomeric disorganization."

Both phosphorylation of Rb and cytoplasmic translocation of Rb were hardly induced by a high dose of TNF-\u03b1 (100 ng/ml) alone or a low dose of TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) in combination with IFN-\u03b3 pretreatment (<a href=\"#fig12\">Author response image 1</a>). The amount of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3used in this study would be greater than their circulating levels in cancer patients, but supraphysiological activity of TNF-\u03b1 is likely to be required in order to obtain a more efficient response in cultured human myotubes. We have now provided relevant discussion in our revised manuscript."
