The first <i>gltA</i> mutation, which increases CS activity by disrupting NADH-inhibition of this enzyme, is beneficial for growth on the acetate and contributed to preserving the rudimentary Cit<sup>+</sup> trait from extinction when it first evolved. However, after Cit<sup>+</sup> was refined by further mutations, this potentiating <i>gltA</i> mutation became deleterious to fitness. A second wave of beneficial <i>gltA</i> mutations then evolved that reduced CS activity to below the ancestral level. Thus, dynamic reorganization of central metabolism made colonizing this new nutrient niche contingent on both co-opting and overcoming a history of prior adaptation."
