The public health risk posed by these two routes is not well understood, particularly in non-pathogenic bacteria. We collected pooled samples from 8 groups of 1741 commercial cattle as they moved through the process of beef production from feedlot entry through slaughter. We recorded antimicrobial drug exposures and interrogated the resistome at points in production when management procedures could potentially influence ARD abundance and/or transmission. Over 300 unique ARDs were identified. Resistome diversity decreased while cattle were in the feedlot, indicating selective pressure. ARDs were not identified in beef products, suggesting that slaughter interventions may reduce the risk of transmission of ARDs to beef consumers. This report highlights the utility and limitations of metagenomics for assessing public health risks regarding antimicrobial resistance, and demonstrates that environmental pathways may represent a greater risk than the food supply."

The public health risk posed by these two routes is not well understood, particularly in non-pathogenic bacteria. We collected pooled samples from 8 groups of 1741 commercial cattle as they moved through the process of beef production from feedlot entry through slaughter. We recorded antimicrobial drug exposures and interrogated the resistome at points in production when management procedures could potentially influence ARD abundance and/or transmission. Over 300 unique ARDs were identified. Resistome diversity decreased while cattle were in the feedlot, indicating selective pressure. ARDs were not identified in beef products, suggesting that slaughter interventions may reduce the risk of transmission of ARDs to beef consumers. This report highlights the utility and limitations of metagenomics for assessing public health risks regarding antimicrobial resistance, and demonstrates that environmental pathways may represent a greater risk than the food supply."

Beef is a widely consumed protein commodity, and production and consumption is expected to increase in the United States and globally (<a href=\"#bib10\">Daniel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">OECD/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2015</a>). In North American beef production, several critically important antimicrobial drugs (AMDs) such as fluoroquinolones, macrolides and third-generation cephalosporins are used, while others are not, e.g., carbapenems (<a href=\"#bib54\">World Health Organization, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Food and Drug Administration, 2003</a>). Use of these AMDs is thought to increase the risk of AMR being transmitted to humans through environmental exposures (i.e., air, water and soil), occupational exposures (<a href=\"#bib27\">Levy et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Moon et al., 2015</a>), as well as through consumption of beef products (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antibiotic Resistance from the Farm to the Table [Internet], 2014</a>). While surveillance for foodborne AMR pathogens has been part of North American food safety systems for decades (<a href=\"#bib36\">National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System \u2013 Enteric Bacteria (NARMS), 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS), 2013</a>), we have yet to fully understand and quantify the public health risk posed by transmission of non-pathogenic bacteria that carry antimicrobial resistance determinants (ARDs). These ARDs could pose a risk to human health if the bacteria carrying them become established within the microbiome of the human host, subsequently enabling horizontal gene transfer to pathogens (<a href=\"#bib13\">Forsberg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rolain, 2013</a>); or if these ARDs are present in opportunistic pathogens that become established within an immunocompromised individual. Establishment within an individual\u2019s microbiome could occur either through the\u00a0ingestion of contaminated food products or through exposure to environmental effluents disseminated from beef feedlots (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antibiotic Resistance from the Farm to the Table [Internet], 2014</a>), i.e., a facility where cattle are aggregated, reared in pens (i.e., outdoor enclosures) and fed a high-energy ration before being slaughtered. The rate at which ARDs from beef products or production facilities become established within humans is unknown, largely due to an historical reliance on culture and isolation of pathogens and an inability to access the microbial community and its complete repertoire of ARDs (i.e., the resistome)."

In North America, use of AMDs is much greater in feedlots than any other phase of beef production (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gow et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rao et al., 2010</a>), a fact that has raised concerns that these operations could represent the principal phase of beef production in which AMR is acquired or maintained. Furthermore, feedlots are intricately linked to environmental exposure pathways such as air, manure, soil, and water, enabling indirect human exposure to feedlot effluents (<a href=\"#bib32\">McEachran et al., 2015</a>). In North America, abattoirs (i.e., slaughterhouses) are a potential control point for the transmission of AMR , as they employ sequential antibacterial interventions to reduce pathogen contamination in beef products; testing of these interventions has demonstrated that they are effective in reducing not only pathogens, but also total bacterial contamination of beef products (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bacon et al., 2000</a>). We hypothesized that the antimicrobial interventions and other procedures used in feedlots and abattoirs would exert a measurable effect on the presence, abundance and composition of ARDs in the bacterial populations of cattle, the feedlot environment and market-ready beef products. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the\u00a0use of a metagenomics approach would enable us to quantify these changes at an ecological level and therefore better understand the risk to public health, compared to the\u00a0use of a culture-based approach."

However, research in this area has been constrained by the challenges of tracking beef products and environmental effluents from individuals or pens of cattle, and collecting detailed records of AMD exposures for the cattle being studied. Specific challenges include lack of unique animal identification, use of non-computerized or hard-to-access AMD treatment records, effluents that are difficult to trace (e.g., air and runoff water), disassembly of carcasses into hundreds of non-linked parts, and the sheer difficulty of obtaining relevant, representative samples from feedlot steers, which weigh over 450 kg. Because of these complexities, studies in this area have been constrained to descriptions of AMR prevalence in isolated sectors of the beef production process without access to relevant AMD exposure data (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sheikh et al., 2012</a>); or they have relied on the use of AMD and AMR data at very abstract levels such as the nation-state (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chantziaras et al., 2013</a>). To our knowledge, no studies have specifically tracked antimicrobial use in cattle while investigating antimicrobial resistance in market-ready products or consumers. This dearth of evidence greatly complicates efforts to develop effective policies related to antimicrobial use in livestock with the goal of protecting public health (<a href=\"#bib25\">Landers et al., 2012</a>). The objective of this study was to perform a prospective longitudinal analysis of antimicrobial use and resistance in beef production and to exploit shotgun metagenomics to characterize resistome dynamics in the environment and the products of cohort cattle from feedlot through to market-ready product."

These samples were collected once around the time that study cattle arrived in the feedlot ('arrival'), and then once when the same cattle had reached slaughter weight and were ready to exit the feedlot ('exit'). Study cattle were then loaded onto transport trucks for shipment to the abattoir. Pooled swabs (green pin) from the inside walls of the transport trucks were collected immediately after the cattle had been unloaded at the abattoir ('truck'). Cattle were then placed into a holding pen outside of the abattoir, where pooled fecal (black pin) and drinking water (blue pin) samples were collected ('holding'). Cattle then entered the abattoir, where they were humanely slaughtered and their carcasses disassembled into beef products for retail.

Capacity in these feedlots was 69,000, 73,000, 74,000, and 98,000 cattle, which is typical for large U.S. feedlots. While small feedlots (defined as feeding &lt;100 cattle) comprise &gt;60% of the ~26,500 feedlot operations in the U.S., large feedlots (defined as feeding &gt;1000 cattle) contain &gt;75% of all cattle that are reared in feedlots in the U.S. (<a href=\"#bib7\">Census of Agriculture, 2012</a>). Animal handling and management procedures in study feedlots were typical for large feedlot operations in North America, and included daily observations of all pens by feedlot personnel trained to identify clinically ill cattle. Sick cattle were moved from their home pen to the cattle handling chute and/or a hospital pen to receive treatment. Rations in these 4 feedlots were corn-based and conformed to the National Research Council diet requirements for beef cattle (<a href=\"#bib37\">National Research Council, 2000</a>). In each feedlot, 2 pens of cattle were enrolled in the study. Because cattle are typically raised in feedlots for at least 5 months, pens of newly arrived cattle are not always available for study participation. Therefore, study pens were a convenience selection from all pens that had been most recently filled to capacity at or near the start of the study. Feedlot owners and managers were aware of the identity of enrolled pens, but personnel involved in managing the cattle on a daily basis were not and therefore it is unlikely that standard operating procedures were altered during the study period. Pen capacities ranged from 150 to 281 cattle, and a total of 1741 cattle were housed in these 8 pens. Antimicrobial exposures were recorded throughout the feeding period, i.e., the total time that animals were housed in the feedlot, which ranged from 117 to 227 days (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). This duration is typical for North American beef cattle that enter feedlots at this age/weight. Analysis of these records indicates that all cattle received in-feed macrolides (tylosin), but use of parenteral AMDs was relatively infrequent at the individual animal level (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). All pens contained at least one animal that was exposed to individual doses of parenteral tetracyclines and macrolides."

Pooled samples provide a representative resistome for the unit of animal management in feedlots and abattoirs, i.e., the pen groupings; they do not provide insight into individual animal resistome variability, and therefore inferences in this study were made at the group level. Pooled fecal, soil and drinking water samples from each pen were collected within 6 weeks after the\u00a0arrival of cattle at the feedlots ('arrival samples', n=24, one pooled sample per pen per sample type; see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>), as well as within 1 day before the same pens of cattle were shipped for slaughter ('exit samples', n=24, one pooled sample per pen per sample type). Cattle were then transported (&lt;8\u2009hr transport time) by truck to 2 abattoirs (one in Texas and one in Colorado) and the walls, floors and ceilings of the trucks were swabbed ('truck samples', n=8, one per pen) immediately after the cattle were unloaded; each abattoir slaughtered ~5500 cattle per day. Outside of the abattoirs, cattle were placed in holding pens (i.e., outdoor enclosures that can hold hundreds of cattle for a short amount of time), where pooled fecal and drinking water samples were collected after cattle had been moved into the abattoir ('holding samples', n=16, one per pen per sample type). Cattle were then euthanized and the carcasses disassembled into beef products. Both abattoirs employed multiple-hurdle interventions to reduce pathogen and other bacterial contamination on carcasses; this included hot water pasteurization, lactic and peroxyacetic acid spray, as well as knife trimming and spot steam vacuuming of the carcass (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). At the end of this process, pooled swab samples were taken from the conveyor belt used to transport disassembled market-ready carcass parts (n=8, one per pen). In addition, beef trimmings (i.e., the parts of the carcass used to make ground beef) were collected and rinsed to obtain a pooled sample of the parts of the carcass with the highest food-safety risk (n=8, one per pen). The metagenomic sequences obtained from table and trimming samples represented the microbiome and resistome after antibacterial interventions had been applied to the carcass, and just before the beef products were packaged for retail distribution ('market-ready samples'). All sampling locations represented points in the beef production process when cattle or their end-products were actively managed and/or antimicrobial interventions were applied, both of which could influence the abundance and/or transmission of ARDs."

One drinking water sample did not contain enough DNA (i.e., &lt;1\u00a0ng) to be sufficiently sequenced. Reads were trimmed and filtered for quality, and reads classified as host genome (<i>Bos taurus)</i> were removed from further analysis (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Non-host reads were then aligned to a custom non-redundant database of ARD sequences compiled from publicly available sources. ARDs with a gene fraction of &gt;80% across all alignments were considered to be positively identified in a sample. We identified 319 unique ARDs across all 87 samples (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), representing 1.2\u00a0M individual read alignments (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Most ARDs were present in low numbers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and the proportion of trimmed, non-host reads aligning to ARDs in the database was correspondingly low across all samples (range 0.00% to 0.12%, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The median number of unique ARDs identified per sample was 33 (range: 0 to 136; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). While this may be an underestimate due to sequencing coverage, recent studies using functional metagenomic screening of dairy cattle feces reported a maximum of 26 unique ARDs per animal (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wichmann et al., 2014</a>). Functional metagenomics offers increased sensitivity compared to shotgun metagenomics (<a href=\"#bib14\">Forsberg et al., 2014</a>), and therefore our observation of a relatively large number of unique ARDs per sample suggests that the pooling of samples undertaken in this study may have increased sensitivity. For comparison, a shotgun metagenomic study of 252 individual human fecal samples identified an average of 21 unique ARDs per sample (<a href=\"#bib15\">Forslund et al., 2013</a>). The 319 ARDs identified in this study represented 42 AMR mechanisms within 17 drug classes (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Reads aligning to genes that encode resistance to tetracyclines and the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin classes of antimicrobials were most abundant, with the TetQ, TetW, TetO, and mefA gene families comprising the majority of alignments within these two classes (see Source Data for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

Samples with only one ARD (n = 2) were removed from clustering analyses. Pre-slaughter samples clustered by sample matrix (i.e., feces, soil, water and swabs, the latter of which comprised all truck samples) based on ARD composition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), suggesting that the resistomes in these sample types differed significantly. Therefore, to avoid confounding, we performed ordination separately on fecal, soil and water samples, all of which exhibited a significant shift from arrival to exit or holding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>); the truck resistome could not be compared owing to complete confounding between sampling location and matrix type. While this shift could result from AMD exposures, culture-based studies of phenotypic resistance have reported mixed results when investigating potential associations between feedlot AMD use and AMR (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Morley et al., 2011</a>). In addition to AMD exposures, cattle undergo numerous changes during the feeding period, including maturation and a gradual shift from forage-based to high-energy rations, all of which have been shown to affect the fecal microbiome in swine, although little is known about these factors in beef cattle (<a href=\"#bib49\">Umu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mach et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, changes in the resistome could also be driven by changes in bacterial community composition, a phenomenon recently reported for a set of functionally confirmed metagenomic soil samples (<a href=\"#bib14\">Forsberg et al., 2014</a>). In order to measure correlation between the microbiome and resistome, and thus to investigate the extent to which microbiome changes may have been driving the resistome, we performed post-hoc procrustes analysis, which can be used to determine the degree of correlation between two ordinations (<a href=\"#bib41\">Peres-Neto and Jackson, 2001</a>). This analysis confirmed a high correlation between the resistome (ARD level) and the microbiome (species level) in arrival and exit samples (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). However, there was tighter correlation on arrival than on exit, leading to the hypothesis that additional factors such as AMD exposures may have influenced resistome changes independently of the microbiome."

Interestingly, this decrease occurred primarily through the\u00a0loss of resistance to AMDs that were not used on cattle in this study population or in the feeding systems in which they were raised (e.g., phenicols, aminocoumarins, elfamycins, rifampin, bacitracin and polymyxin B, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In contrast, resistance to macrolides and tetracyclines remained prevalent in exit and holding pen samples, and these were the two classes of AMDs most commonly administered to cattle within study pens (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In addition, 5 of the 8 pens contained several cattle that received fluoroquinolones, and 3 of the 8 contained several cattle that received \u03b2-lactam AMDs. One hypothesis for the finding of reduced ARD richness is that the pattern of antimicrobial exposures during the feeding period created pressure on microbes that favored maintenance of ARDs that conferred a fitness advantage (i.e., ARDs protecting against macrolides and tetracyclines). Conversely, ARDs conferring resistance to antimicrobials that were not used in this study population (e.g., phenicols, aminocoumarins, elfamycins) or non-drug-specific ARDs (e.g., porin modification genes) did not confer a competitive advantage and may have exacted a fitness cost to bacteria carrying them (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vogwill and MacLean, 2015</a>). Thus, such bacteria may have gradually diminished in the population, leading to disappearance of these ARDs within the pan-microbial population and thus an observed decrease in ARD richness. These pan-microbial population genetic changes may also explain the apparent decoupling of the resistome and the microbiome that was observed from feedlot arrival to exit (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A\u2013B</a>). However, more research is needed to understand how selective pressures acting on specific bacteria may manifest at the pan-microbial level."

While this study was not designed to definitely test for AMD-ARD associations, these findings suggest that the relationship between AMD use and AMR is not straightforward. In addition, we identified several ARDs that confer resistance to critically important antimicrobial drugs in humans when expressed in disease-causing agents (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>); however, these AMDs were not used in this study population and most are not sold for use in cattle. An arrival soil sample contained the functionally-confirmed carbapenemase (bla)OXA-235 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Higgins et al., 2013</a>) as well as vgaD and vatG ARDs, which together confer resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jung et al., 2010</a>). Another arrival soil sample and a water sample from a holding pen contained (bla)OXA-347, which has only been shown to confer resistance to ampicillin but is classified as a carbapenemase based on 53% amino acid identity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2012</a>); therefore, it is unknown whether this is a true carbapenemase ARD. Of the 7 sequenced water samples collected from holding pens, 3 contained reads aligning to the strict carbapenemase class bla(cphA). Additionally, the 4 truck samples collected in Texas all contained a CfrA 23S rRNA methyltransferase, which confers resistance to phenicols, lincosamides, oxazolidinones (linezolid), pleuromutilins, and streptogramin A (PhLOPS<sub>A</sub>). Despite the presence of these ARDs, study cattle were not exposed to aminoglycosides, carbapenems, streptogramins, phenicols, lincosamides, linezolid, or pleuromutilins while in the feedlot (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In addition, carbapenems, pleuromutilins and linezolid are not approved for use in cattle production, and therefore antimicrobial use practices cannot directly explain the presence of these important ARDs. We also identified bla(TEM)-116, an extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) ARD, in 1 water holding pen sample. Third-generation cephalosporins (a class of \u03b2-lactams) are used in beef cattle production, although other drugs are often used more commonly as reflected in this study (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

While high sequence homology and the resistance-conferring functional residues were intact (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), we cannot infer phenotypic expression from these data. Furthermore, while this is the first published report of these ARDs in the feedlot setting, it is also the first study to utilize a shotgun metagenomics approach on feedlot samples; therefore, we cannot contextualize these findings with respect to previous research and we cannot determine whether presence of these ARDs in feedlot samples is a novel or long-standing phenomenon. Identifying these ARDs in metagenomic data may provide important insight above and beyond a culture- or PCR-based approach, but additional work is needed to understand the biological, ecological, and public health consequences of these findings (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mart\u00ednez et al., 2015</a>). For instance, the presence of these ARDs in the feedlot soil could be explained by transfer into the feedlot environment through either other cattle or fomites (e.g., feedlot workers, feedlot working dogs and horses), or through air or water. Use of other AMD classes could also co-select for these ARDs within the cattle population. These findings highlight the complexity of the AMD\u2013AMR relationship, as well as the fact that food production is intrinsically linked to other ecosystems via diffuse environmental contacts. Given these complexities, we believe an ecological and metagenomic approach is necessary to thoroughly and comprehensively research this important public and human health issue."

However, common management strategies used in all 4 feedlots and the ubiquitous use of in-feed macrolides within study pens could explain this lack of difference. In addition, water runoff, windborne dust and fomites within feedlots could contribute to a mixing of pen resistomes, despite differential AMD exposures across pens. Resistome composition did show statistical difference by geography at the ARD level (i.e., Colorado versus Texas feedlot, truck, and holding pen samples), but not at the level of resistance mechanism or class. Despite statistical significance, both the R<sup>2</sup> value from adonis results and the R-statistic from anosim results suggest that the biological relevance of the differences between states was not high (see <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). These findings support the idea of environmental connectivity within feedlots, and perhaps within and between geographic regions.

                        "text": "When examining the 16 post-slaughter samples obtained from the belts, tables, and meat trimmings, no ARDs were identified in any of these market-ready samples (n = 8 pooled belt/table samples and n=8 trimming rinses). These samples yielded large amounts of DNA, but &gt;99% of the reads aligned to the bovine genome (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>); therefore, the lack of detection of ARDs could likely be attributable to low-sequencing coverage of bacterial DNA. However, there are also plausible biological explanations for the lack of bacterial DNA (and thus ARDs) in these samples. The bacterial contamination of beef during slaughter occurs primarily during the\u00a0removal of the hide and gastrointestinal tract (GIT), at which point the surfaces of carcasses can routinely be contaminated with aerobic bacterial counts of 6.1 \u2013 9.1 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/100 cm<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bacon et al., 2000</a>). To decrease this contamination, it is standard in North America for carcasses to undergo several highly effective antibacterial interventions after hide and GIT removal, including steam vacuuming, carcass washing, application of organic acid rinses and thermal pasteurization (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bacon et al., 2000</a>). All carcasses in this study underwent each of these interventions sequentially, a process that has been shown to reduce bacterial loads by &gt;5 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/100 cm<sup>2</sup> total plate count (<a href=\"#bib19\">Greig et al., 2012</a>). Nevertheless, nationwide food safety surveys in the U.S. suggest that a relatively low level of bacterial presence is common on post-slaughter beef trimmings, with aerobic plate counts routinely containing 10<sup>2</sup>\u201310<sup>3</sup> CFU/g of trimmings (<a href=\"#bib50\">USDA, FSIS, 2011</a>). It is likely that some unknown proportion of these organisms harbor ARDs, suggesting that the shotgun metagenomics assay as used in these high-host background samples may have had low sensitivity to detect these very low-abundance ARDs."

                        "text": "To differentiate between the effects of incomplete sequencing and true reduction of the microbial population, we conducted a microbiome analysis of samples collected pre- and post-slaughter, the former comprising all arrival, exit, truck, and holding pen samples. We found that microbiome (i.e., total microbial community) diversity was reduced in the post-slaughter samples compared to the pre-slaughter samples, suggesting a dramatic alteration in the composition of the microbial community, which could reflect the impact of antibacterial interventions that are applied during slaughter (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). However, low diversity could also be the result of low-coverage sequencing of microbial DNA in the post-slaughter samples (<a href=\"#bib45\">Smith et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, we conducted a closer analysis of differential microbial abundance between pre- and post-slaughter samples using zero-inflated Gaussian mixture models to account for distinct processes for zero-count data (i.e., true absence vs. incomplete sequencing depth) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Paulson et al., 2013</a>). Pairwise comparisons between pre- and post-slaughter samples were performed using limma\u2019s makeContrasts function (<a href=\"#bib46\">Smyth, 2004</a>), and pen ID was added to all models as a covariable to account for repeated measurements. We identified 416 (of 763) differentially abundant genera and 840 (of 1821) differentially abundant species, the vast majority of which were more abundant in the pre-slaughter samples (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Of the 19 genera and 68 species that were more abundant in post-slaughter samples, many are known to be heat-tolerant and/or environmentally hardy bacteria, archaea, viruses, and phages (see<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>); e.g., <i>Staphylothermus, Pyrococcus, Pseudomonas</i> and <i>Pleurocapsa</i>, suggesting that they were able to withstand the high heat and other harsh conditions utilized as part of the slaughter antimicrobial interventions. However, sample matrices in the pre- and post-slaughter samples were confounded with location. Therefore, we performed the same analysis solely on swab samples (pre-slaughter swabs from the transport trucks and post-slaughter swabs from the abattoir conveyor belts). Interestingly, the same overall pattern of change was observed; the majority of bacterial genera (105/757) exhibited decreased abundance post-slaughter (see <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, unlike the comparison across all matrices, the genera with increased relative abundance in post-slaughter swab samples were not characterized by a large proportion of environmentally hardy bacteria ( <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source\u00a0data\u00a01</a>). Given that the truck environment is also relatively harsh (i.e., extreme temperatures, lack of nutrients, dry conditions), this result was not unexpected. Taken together, these results suggest that the multiple-hurdle interventions decrease overall bacterial load, and thus greatly diminish the abundance of ARDs in post-slaughter beef. However, the incomplete sequencing depth in the post-slaughter samples cannot be fully discounted and future metagenomic investigations of samples with high-host background should consider methods to overcome this limitation. We were unable to compare these results to previous studies in the abattoir setting, as most of these bacteria are difficult or impossible to culture and therefore have not been investigated. Interestingly, culture-based resistance surveillance in beef trimmings reported &gt;30% prevalence of resistance amongst <i>Salmonella</i> isolates (<a href=\"#bib50\">USDA, FSIS, 2011</a>). However, <i>Salmonella</i> was recovered from &lt;1% of these trimming samples (22 of 1,791 samples collected in 2011), suggesting that the\u00a0recovery of resistant <i>Salmonella</i> is a very rare event; in this respect, the results of these culture-based efforts concur with our findings. Furthermore, samples taken as part of the culture-based surveillance program were enriched prior to isolation, likely resulting in increased sensitivity for <i>Salmonella</i> detection compared to the shotgun metagenomics approach. Further work is needed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of shotgun metagenomics with more traditional assays."

This is particularly important given the increasing availability of next-generation sequencing machines worldwide.

This concern is especially salient given evidence in this study that ARDs may be 'shared' between the\u00a0pens of cattle and feedlots within a geographic region, indicating environmental connectivity that could also extend to human habitats through wastewater run-off, manure application on cropland, and windborne particulate matter. The pattern of resistome change during the feeding period suggests that AMD use practices may be a driving force shaping the feedlot resistome, but more research is warranted. In particular, this study utilized pooled samples to explore resistome dynamics within and between groups of animals; the excrement or meat products from animals treated with a rarely used antimicrobial (e.g., a fluoroquinolone or \u03b2-lactam) were less likely to be included in the pooled samples compared to end-products of animals treated with a commonly-used antimicrobial (e.g. in-feed macrolide). Future research should include the\u00a0sampling of individual treated and untreated animals to better discern the effect of AMD exposure on the resistome. Furthermore, the scientific community urgently needs to develop a better understanding of the risk of different resistomes and resistance genes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mart\u00ednez et al., 2015</a>) and to unify ARD nomenclature so that databases are standardized and analyses are comparable across studies (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hall and Schwarz, 2015</a>). Finally, this study highlights the utility of an ecological, metagenomics, and systems approach to investigating AMR in food production, and provides unique insights that can be used to better inform agricultural and public health policy."

While it is unlikely that pooled samples represent all individual animals within a pen or unit, they do represent a group-level sample that can be used to understand group-level dynamics. This is especially true given research indicating the tendency for cohabiting individuals to share similar microbiomes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Song et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</a>). Because livestock animals are typically managed in groups, pooled samples are likely the appropriate unit of sampling. In addition, recent work has shown that pooled samples do not produce statistically or biologically significant differences in prevalence estimates for resistant generic <i>Escherichia coli</i> compared to individual samples (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benedict et al., 2013</a>). In order to balance external representativeness with biological replicates, 4 feedlots and 2 pens per feedlot were selected for sampling.

All models included pen identification number as a covariable to account for potential clustering of observations. The output of fitZig was then transferred into limma\u2019s 'makeContrasts' and 'eBayes' functions to conduct pairwise comparisons of log<sub>2</sub>-fold change in abundance between sample groups (<a href=\"#bib46\">Smyth, 2004</a>), adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and using a critical \u03b1 of 0.05."

In a few places, however, I was concerned with an over-reliance on p-values. It wasn't clear if all hypotheses tests applied were pre-planned or whether some were suggested by the data (such as the test for a difference in the degree of correlation between ARD content and species composition in arrival and exit samples, as reported in the legend to <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). If these are post-hoc (with comparison suggested by the data), the p-values won't be meaningful and it would be better to just report the magnitude of the difference (and, ideally, a measure of uncertainty) and flag up the observation as hypothesis generating. Equally, it wasn't clear to me if there were other hypotheses tests that were conducted but not reported. A clear statement of pre-planned hypothesis tests in the methods would be useful."

This area is still very underdeveloped and this paper could well make an important scientific contribution, both in terms of methodology as well as in learning about the biological processes behind. However, I found some formal deficiencies in the study, mostly in the Materials and methods and Results sections. Because of this, the paper as it stands reads a bit like a black-box study. I hope the authors can address some of the issues, detailed below, which could potentially improve the study greatly. Crucially, the authors should better present the relationship between AMU and the changes in ARD in the pen levels. The authors should provide some recommendation as to how to assess changes in resistome in other animal production systems in the USA or other countries. I find it a major flaw that sample results are very much dependent on the matrix typing, making comparison between different types of sample almost impossible. It is hard to understand the low number of ARG identified per sample (Cheng et al., 2012), given that samples are pooled and expected to harbour millions of organisms. The authors should provide plausible explanations for this. The prevalence of ARD per sample should be presented. Specific comments are provided below."

The sampling plan is confusing. The should be conveniently be presented in a table indicating number of samples of each types from, as well as from how many sites (pens feces and floors, water, trucks, meat, trimming samples, end of conveyor belts, sponge samples).

Granted abattoir interventions are reported to be very effective but it seems implausible that if one can perform a simple APC and recover bacteria post-slaughter that none harbor ARD.

In particular, tylosin is administered in-feed daily and the target site is the GIT yet the ADD is calculated for injectable tylosin with a target tissue of the lung. Simply developing an ADD based on a different formulation, route of administration, target tissue, target pathogen, etc. is flawed thinking. If the oral administration has an effect \u2013 and presumably it reduces the incidence of liver abscesses \u2013 then that should represent a defined daily dose. That is where an effect \u2013 if any \u2013 would be in terms of the GIT resistome. Why are some doses mg/lb and others lb/kg BW? Also, tylosin is applied to the pen so the probability of a treated animal being included in a pool is 100% yet only 14 animals were treated with a FQ. What is the probability of a FQ-treated animal being included in a pool? It if is low, then the resistome of a treated animal may look very different to the pen average? See points #1 and #2."

In particular, all three reviewers highlighted aspects of the presentation that need to be substantially improved to make it clearer what was done (and why), and also to make it more accessible to a wider audience. This includes avoiding or defining jargon that won't be familiar to general readers. Two reviewers thought <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> should be replaced by something more informative and this should be considered an essential revision. Reviewer 1 highlighted the need to clarify which hypothesis tests were pre-planned (prior to examining the data) and which, if any, were post-hoc. Review 1 also pointed out that where p-values are reported they should in general be accompanied by more informative summary measures. The section on fitness cost was also identified as needing attention. Reviewer 2 highlighted the need to better present the relationship between AMU and the changes in ARD in the pen levels and also to explain the low number of ARG identified per sample, given that samples are pooled and expected to harbour millions of organisms. Reviewer 2 also made suggestions for improving <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and requested a clear presentation of information about which pens received medicated feeds or injectable antibiotics. Reviewer 3 highlighted the fact that, as presented, the work could potentially be misleading, with the implication that 1700 animals were followed rather than 8 cohorts. This reviewer also identified the need to discuss the limitations of metagenomics, in particular with reference to sensitivity limitations. A number of problems with <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> were also identified that need to be addressed. All comments in the three reviews below should be addressed."

We have added additional wording in the Results and Discussion, eighth paragraph, that specifically addresses the APC issue, and also discusses the Se limitations of the metagenomics assay. This is a tricky issue, as the available data suggests that APC counts coming off of post-chilled carcasses are commonly below LOD (i.e. 10<sup>0</sup> or 10<sup>1</sup> CFU/100cm<sup>2</sup>). However, we then tend to see an uptick in APCs at the end of the fabrication line, suggesting that bacteria are somehow either re-introduced into carcasses, or the very, very rare existing bacteria undergo rapid growth during the fabrication process. The increased surface area that occurs during fabrication likely contributes as well. In any case, we agree with the need to address the apparent discrepancy between APC counts and our results, and have added citations of APCs for post-fabrication products; we would point, however, that the only publicly available citations are relatively outdated (2007), and intervention strategies have changed in the meantime. In short, more work is needed to understand the LOD for metagenomics in high-host background samples, as we point out in the Results and Discussion section, last paragraph and the Conclusion, first paragraph."
