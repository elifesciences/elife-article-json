However, it is unclear how these processes are regulated and function. To determine these mechanisms, we characterized the folding energy and kinetics of four representative SNARE complexes at a single-molecule level using high-resolution optical tweezers. We found that all SNARE complexes assemble by the same step-wise zippering mechanism: slow N-terminal domain (NTD) association, a pause in a force-dependent half-zippered intermediate, and fast C-terminal domain (CTD) zippering. The energy release from CTD zippering differs for yeast (13 <i>k</i><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>T</i>) and neuronal SNARE complexes (27 <i>k</i><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>T</i>), and is concentrated at the C-terminal part of CTD zippering. Thus, SNARE complexes share a conserved zippering pathway and polarized energy release to efficiently drive membrane fusion, but generate different amounts of zippering energy to regulate fusion kinetics."

However, it is unclear how these processes are regulated and function. To determine these mechanisms, we characterized the folding energy and kinetics of four representative SNARE complexes at a single-molecule level using high-resolution optical tweezers. We found that all SNARE complexes assemble by the same step-wise zippering mechanism: slow N-terminal domain (NTD) association, a pause in a force-dependent half-zippered intermediate, and fast C-terminal domain (CTD) zippering. The energy release from CTD zippering differs for yeast (13 <i>k</i><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>T</i>) and neuronal SNARE complexes (27 <i>k</i><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>T</i>), and is concentrated at the C-terminal part of CTD zippering. Thus, SNARE complexes share a conserved zippering pathway and polarized energy release to efficiently drive membrane fusion, but generate different amounts of zippering energy to regulate fusion kinetics."

Vesicles are small, membrane-enclosed packages that are used to transport molecules between different membranes; and in order to release its cargo, a vesicle must fuse with its target membrane. To fuse like this, the forces that act to push membranes away from one another need to be overcome. Proteins called SNARES, which are embedded in both membranes, are the molecular engines that power the fusion process. Once the SNARE proteins from the vesicle and the target membrane bind, they assemble into a more compact complex that pulls the two membranes close together and allows fusion to take place."

Furthermore, Zorman et al. propose that the reason why the majority of energy is released in the later stages of complex assembly is because this is when the repulsion between the two membranes is strongest."

Malfunction of fusion has been associated with many important diseases such as neurological disorders and diabetes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burre et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Stockli et al., 2011</a>). Consistent with their diverse functions and dysfunctions, these intracellular membrane fusion processes exhibit distinct kinetics and regulation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kasai et al., 2012</a>). For example, fusion of synaptic vesicles occurs within 0.2 ms in response to the arrival of an action potential (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sabatini and Regehr, 1996</a>), whereas vacuole fusion in yeast is constitutive and lasts minutes (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wickner, 2010</a>). Although these diverse processes have long been identified, it is not fully understood how SNAREs specialize in membrane fusion and become adapted to and regulated for various fusion speeds."

Each SNARE protein contains one or two defining SNARE motifs of around 60 amino acids in eight heptad repeats (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The motif is often connected to a C-terminal transmembrane domain via a short linker domain (LD of \u223c10 a.a.). Complementary SNAREs are anchored to transport vesicles (v-SNAREs) and their targeted membranes (t-SNAREs) in disordered or partially disordered conformations. Their specific interactions lead to coupled folding and assembly into a stable parallel four-helix bundle, drawing the two membranes into close proximity for fusion (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sollner et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sudhof and Rothman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gao et al., 2012</a>). In the core of each SNARE bundle are 15 layers of hydrophobic amino acids and one middle layer of ionic amino acids. The ionic layer is formed by three glutamine residues (Q) and one arginine residue (R) from each of the SNARE motifs categorized as Q<sub>a</sub>, Q<sub>b</sub>, Q<sub>c</sub>, and R SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fasshauer et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

However, the kinetics and energetics of SNARE folding have not been well characterized. It is notoriously difficult to study SNARE assembly using traditional ensemble-based experimental approaches due to the many states and pathways involved in the folding process, especially misassembled states (<a href=\"#bib51\">Weninger et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pobbati et al., 2006</a>). In addition, functional SNARE assembly occurs in the presence of the opposing force imposed by membranes, which has a great impact on the kinetics and regulation of SNARE assembly (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sudhof and Rothman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gao et al., 2012</a>). Although studies of SNARE assembly are facilitated by the use of soluble SNAREs isolated from membranes, the lack of an essential force load may complicate data interpretation regarding functional SNARE assembly. For example, whereas complexin can suspend assembly of trans-SNAREs in a partially zippered state (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kummel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Malsam et al., 2012</a>), it cannot do so for isolated SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2002</a>).

This single-molecule manipulation method allows measurement of the folding energy and kinetics of macromolecules under equilibrium conditions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liphardt et al., 2001</a>). Furthermore, the external force applied to the SNARE complex mimics the opposing force from membranes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Min et al., 2013</a>). Using this single-molecule method, we proved the long-standing hypothesis that neuronal SNAREs assemble by a zippering mechanism and discovered a half-zippered SNARE intermediate that plays a crucial role in the synchronized, calcium-triggered synaptic vesicle fusion (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gao et al., 2012</a>). Step-wise SNARE zippering is initiated by slow association between N-terminal domains (NTDs) of t- and v-SNAREs. SNARE assembly then pauses in the half-zippered state in a force-dependent manner. Finally, the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the v-SNARE (VAMP2 or synaptobrevin) rapidly zippers along the pre-structured t-SNARE template to drive fast membrane fusion."

Furthermore, it is not clear how SNARE assembly is adapted to efficient and versatile membrane fusion. It has been proposed that SNAREs generally assemble in an all-or-none manner without any partially folded intermediates (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kasai et al., 2012</a>). It is argued that assembly of neuronal SNARE complexes occurs in a large energy gradient, and thus cannot be stopped halfway to form any partially assembled intermediates (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</a>). However, despite its fast speed, downhill SNARE assembly would be poorly coupled to membrane fusion, resulting in low energy efficiency of the SNARE engine. In contrast, many molecular engines tested at a single-molecule level have nearly 100% energy efficiency (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bustamante et al., 2004</a>). Based on the first law of thermodynamics, a mechanochemical process has 100% energy efficiency only when the process is reversible. Therefore, to maximize their energy efficiency, SNAREs are expected to fold in a relatively smooth energy landscape (<a href=\"#bib35\">Onuchic and Wolynes, 2004</a>) in the presence of the membrane load. This requires a close match between the energy landscape of SNARE assembly and the energy profile of membrane interactions. The energy opposing membrane fusion includes contributions from the long-ranged entropic membrane undulation, membrane deformation, and electrostatic interactions, and the short-ranged membrane dehydration and van der Waals interactions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Leckband and Israelachvili, 2001</a>). The strong short-ranged repulsion is the largest energy barrier for fusion and takes place within a few nanometers of membrane separation, thus constituting a hard core for fusion. To break this hard core, a SNARE complex is required to focus its folding energy on the membrane proximal C-terminus. Therefore, analogous to a car engine, an efficient SNARE engine is expected to change gears to meet increasing resistance as SNAREs fold towards membranes. However, it remains unclear whether such a gear-changing mechanism exists in SNARE assembly."

The continuous extension increase was mainly caused by stretching of the semi-flexible DNA handle while the SNARE complex remained in the same folding state. The resultant force-extension curves (FECs) could generally be fit by the worm-like chain model of the DNA and polypeptide (<a href=\"#bib29\">Marko and Siggia, 1995</a>). In contrast, abrupt extension changes resulted from cooperative protein transitions between different states (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The FECs show that all four SNARE complexes sequentially unfolded via two reversible transitions and one or two irreversible unfolding steps. Compared to the FECs reported for the neuronal SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gao et al., 2012</a>) and confirmed by the detailed analysis described below, the second reversible transition (between state 2 and state 3) and the first irreversible transition (between state 3 and state 4) resulted from folding/unfolding transitions of CTD and NTD, respectively. Both transitions are energetically or kinetically distinct for each of the four SNARE complexes, as is demonstrated by non-overlapping distributions of the characteristic forces or different lifetimes associated with these transitions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In particular, NTD is mechanically more stable than CTD and unfolded generally after 10\u201310<sup>5</sup> CTD folding and unfolding transitions under our experimental conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

Note that heterogeneity in SNARE zippering was observed, a phenomenon also seen in many single-molecule experiments (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sirinakis et al., 2011</a>). The heterogeneity is manifested by changes in the rate and/or the equilibrium force of the C-terminal domain (CTD) transition detected in different pulling cycles of the same chimeric SNARE protein. For the single neuronal SNARE protein shown here, both equilibrium force and rate of the CTD transition are slightly lower in the first pulling cycle than in the following two cycles. More heterogeneity can be seen in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3</a>."

In this case, the time-dependent extension change represented spontaneous folding/unfolding transition of the protein under tension due to thermal fluctuations. Both transitions in each of the four SNARE complexes were binary, as indicated by the two peaks in the histogram distributions of extension (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The transitions remained cooperative at all forces tested, but were shifted to unfolded states at higher forces. Furthermore, the four SNARE complexes had similar average extension changes for both transitions (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), implying that the same SNARE domains were involved in the observed transitions. Taken together, the results from experiments in variable and constant forces suggest that all four SNARE complexes follow similar pathways to assembly or disassemble via at least two intermediates."

The calculated SNARE energy was plotted in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> as a function of the membrane distance. SNARE NTD association was initiated at the very N-termini of t- and v-SNAREs at a large distance of 12.5 nm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>). The association was accompanied by coil-to-helix propagation of the partially disordered t-SNARE towards its C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, state ii). Further NTD zippering led to the half-zippered trans-SNARE complex at 9.7 nm (state iii) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bharat et al., 2014</a>).

CTD zippering drew two membranes from 9.7 nm to 1 nm for fusion against a large average force. As a result, CTD zippering of the trans-SNARE complex reduced the energy barrier of membrane fusion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, state iv) to 7.4 <i>k</i><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>T</i> per SNARE complex (the energy difference between state iv and state iii), consistent with a fusion rate of \u223c600 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, where we assumed a maximum fusion rate of 10<sup>6</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> in the absence of any energy barrier (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yang and Gruebele, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gao et al., 2012</a>). Correspondingly, the metastable half-zippered SNARE complex in the absence of a force load was stabilized by the short-ranged membrane opposing force (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) together with regulatory proteins, such as complexin (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sudhof and Rothman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Min et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, the optical trapping force used in our experiments was long-range, with a typical force constant of 0.1 pN/nm, compared to an average force constant of 7.1 pN/nm for the membrane force opposing CTD assembly. As a result, the half-zippered SNARE state was typically short-lived (&lt;0.2 ms) upon reassembly of the SNARE complex at the low forces favoring NTD association (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), because the trapping force opposing CTD zippering remained small immediately after NTD was zippered. Thus, the membrane's repulsive force was an integral component of SNARE assembly and regulation."

SNARE zippering indeed met this requirement by producing a high force in this region. Here, the magnitude of local force generated by SNARE zippering was equivalent to the slope of the energy landscape of the unloaded SNARE complex with respect to extension, which also represents the energy density (defined as the folding energy per unit length of R SNARE polypeptide chain zippered) distributed along the SNARE bundle. While zippering of the first two-thirds of CTD generated an average force of 8 pN, zippering of the last one-third of CTD produces an average force of up to 32 pN (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), well suited to counteracting the short-ranged membrane opposing force. The position where CTD changed its energy density (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, at 5 nm) was intriguing, because it was close to the energy barrier of the trans-SNARE complex. This position overlap is no accident, because any force applied to the SNARE complex tilts the CTD zippering energy landscape of the unloaded SNARE complex toward the unfolded state (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bustamante et al., 2004</a>), which tends to make the density-changing point an energy barrier (for example, see Figure S9 in <a href=\"#bib53\">Xi et al., 2012</a>).

In this alternative landscape, the energy of CTD is enriched at its N-terminus, rather than its C-terminus, but with the same total CTD zippering energy. The half-zippered trans-SNARE complex is now greatly stabilized by membranes (at 8 nm of the blue dashed line), but nearly unable to fuse them, because the energy barrier for fusion increases to 24 <i>k</i><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>T</i> (the energy difference between states at membrane distances of 1 nm and 8 nm) compared to 7.4 <i>k</i><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>T</i> for the wild-type SNARE complex. In this case, significant energy from CTD zippering is not transmitted to membranes, but dissipated as heat. In addition, no additional energy barrier appears before fusion. Similarly, SNAREs alone with this alternative folding energy landscape are expected to zipper or unzip in a continuous manner in response to the force exerted by optical tweezers, in contrast to the observed cooperative two-state manner."

The step-wise and reversible assembly enhances not only the coupling between SNARE zippering and membrane fusion, but also the specificity of SNARE pairing.

Fusion of GLUT4-storage vesicles (GSVs) with the plasma membrane mediated by the GLUT4 SNARE complex appears to be very similar to fusion of synaptic vesicles, including distinct stages of vesicle docking, priming, fusion (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stockli et al., 2011</a>), and close CTD zippering energy.

This distribution allows SNAREs to increase their force output as CTD zippering draws two membranes into close proximity. Thus, as specialized engines for membrane fusion, SNAREs contain a built-in automatic transmission system that adjusts their force output to accommodate the large force change required for membrane fusion. This system ensures efficient and tight coupling between SNARE zippering and membrane fusion. A mismatch between the force output from SNAREs and the load from membranes would inevitably lead to dissipation of the SNARE zippering energy into heat, reducing the efficiency or the rate of membrane fusion. Thus, membrane fusion requires SNAREs to \u2018save the best for last\u2019."

The ordered t-SNARE then serves as a template for fast and energetic VAMP2 zippering (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gao et al., 2012</a>).

The total energy of the single-molecule system additionally includes the harmonic potential energy of two beads in optical traps. The folding energy of the structured part of the SNARE complex as a function of the contour length gives the folding energy landscape of SNARE folding. In our data analysis, this energy landscape was characterized by the free energy of the folded state and the transition state and their associated positions in the reaction coordinate, all relative to the unfolded state. Both energy and positions were chosen as model parameters first to calculate the total system energy and the extension of the SNARE-DNA tether. Then these calculations were used to further compute the opening probability based on the Boltzmann distribution and the folding and unfolding rates based on Kramer's theory, as well as the extension change, for the transition of each SNARE domain.

The last term in the effective extension expression (<math id=\"inf7\"><mrow><msup><mi>l</mi><mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow></mrow></msup><msup><mi>p</mi><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow></mrow></msup><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math>) corrects for the residual extension of the unfolded polypeptide in the absence of external force when one end of the polypeptide is attached to the membrane, which is estimated to be half of the Flory radius of a semi-flexible chain (<a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2007</a>). Solving this non-linear equation at different contour lengths, we obtained the membrane distance <i>d</i> at any SNARE zippering stage. The energy landscapes of trans-SNAREs are the total energy of SNAREs (including the folding energy and the elastic energy of unfolded polypeptide) and membrane interaction energy as a function of the membrane distance (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The calculations were performed using Matlab codes that are available as source codes."

After the C-terminal half unzipping, the neuronal and endosomal SNARE complexes require a 5 to 10 pN higher force to unzip the N-terminal half (the irreversible transition), whereas in the GLUT4 and yeast SNARE complexes, the N-terminal half unzipping occurs almost simultaneously with the C-terminal half unzipping. This point is important because the authors stress that the C-terminal half of the SNARE motif works as a sort of independent domain in SNARE-complex assembly for all four SNARE complexes. To make this scenario possible, it is presumed that the N-terminal half is stably assembled, while the C-terminal half then shows zippering in a selective manner after a certain pause. The authors need to characterize the force range in which they see the N-terminal half unzipping for each type of the SNARE complex (the number of molecules studied should be specified), and compare this force distribution with that used for the CTD folding and unfolding (e.g., shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). If these two force ranges (one for NTD unfolding and the other for CTD unfolding/refolding) are largely overlapping for a certain type of the SNARE complex, the SNARE-complex assembly may be essentially a one-step process in an all-or-none manner for that type of the SNARE complex."

However, this overlap does not contradict the stage-wise assembly and disassembly of the GLUT4 SNARE complex. Strictly speaking, the CTD equilibrium force and the NTD unzipping force are different quantities and are not directly comparable. The equilibrium force is defined as the force under which the CTD has half unfolding probability (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), whereas the NTD unzipping force is defined as the force that NTD first unzips. At a low pulling or force-loading speed, NTD may unzip before the pulling force reaches the CTD equilibrium force (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a> for an example). However, in this case, CTD typically has already folded and unfolded for more than 30 times. If we compare the force and time difference at which CTD and NTD first unzip for each SNARE complex, the CTD always unzips earlier and at lower force than NTD for all four SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, the CTD and the NTD unzips in a sequential manner. This observation cannot be explained by an \u201call-or-none\u201d assembly mechanism, because such a two-state process also implies a simultaneous and one-step unfolding of the whole SNARE bundle, which is not observed."

A lower pulling speed will decrease the force difference, mainly because the average NTD unzipping force decreases. Under a constant force, distinct CTD and NTD assembly or disassembly can still be revealed by their different lifetimes. The average lifetime of the folded CTD is generally less than 50 milliseconds under our experimental conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), whereas the average lifetime of the folded NTD is typically greater than 10 s in these experiments. Without a long NTD lifetime, it would be impossible for us to collect more than tens of thousands of CTD transition events at constant forces required to accurately determine the CTD opening probability and transition rates shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>.

In particular, the spacer sequence has minimal effort on CTD transition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), because the extension of the spacers does not change in this process. Third, the spacer sequence introduced between syntaxin and SNAP-25 does not significantly affect the function of the t-SNARE to mediate membrane fusion in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 4</a>). Fourth, results from the single-molecule manipulation experiments are generally homogenous among different molecules pulled and consistent with correctly folded four-helix bundle structures. If alternative folded conformations had occurred in our experiments, they could have been identified from their different assembly/disassembly kinetics (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). Fifth, for yeast SNARE complex, the derived LD and CTD transitions are corroborated by the experimental results from truncated SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 4</a>). Finally, the minor effect of the spacer sequences on SNARE assembly is confirmed by our theoretical calculations (Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2).
