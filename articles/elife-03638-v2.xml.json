                    "text": "CTP Synthetase (CtpS) is a universally conserved and essential metabolic enzyme. While many enzymes form small oligomers, CtpS forms large-scale filamentous structures of unknown function in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. By simultaneously monitoring CtpS polymerization and enzymatic activity, we show that polymerization inhibits activity, and CtpS's product, CTP, induces assembly. To understand how assembly inhibits activity, we used electron microscopy to define the structure of CtpS polymers. This structure suggests that polymerization sterically hinders a conformational change necessary for CtpS activity. Structure-guided mutagenesis and mathematical modeling further indicate that coupling activity to polymerization promotes cooperative catalytic regulation. This previously uncharacterized regulatory mechanism is important for cellular function since a mutant that disrupts CtpS polymerization disrupts <i>E. coli</i> growth and metabolic regulation without reducing CTP levels. We propose that regulation by large-scale polymerization enables ultrasensitive control of enzymatic activity while storing an enzyme subpopulation in a conformationally restricted form that is readily activatable."

                    "text": "CTP Synthetase (CtpS) is a universally conserved and essential metabolic enzyme. While many enzymes form small oligomers, CtpS forms large-scale filamentous structures of unknown function in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. By simultaneously monitoring CtpS polymerization and enzymatic activity, we show that polymerization inhibits activity, and CtpS's product, CTP, induces assembly. To understand how assembly inhibits activity, we used electron microscopy to define the structure of CtpS polymers. This structure suggests that polymerization sterically hinders a conformational change necessary for CtpS activity. Structure-guided mutagenesis and mathematical modeling further indicate that coupling activity to polymerization promotes cooperative catalytic regulation. This previously uncharacterized regulatory mechanism is important for cellular function since a mutant that disrupts CtpS polymerization disrupts <i>E. coli</i> growth and metabolic regulation without reducing CTP levels. We propose that regulation by large-scale polymerization enables ultrasensitive control of enzymatic activity while storing an enzyme subpopulation in a conformationally restricted form that is readily activatable."

The rate at which an enzyme produces its product is often carefully regulated. Some molecules slow or stop an enzyme by binding to and blocking the site where its substrates normally bind: its \u2018active site\u2019. Other molecules can also bind to sites other than the active site, which can cause the enzyme to become either more or less active."

The enzyme's activity is also regulated by the levels of UTP and CTP, and by another molecule (called GTP) that binds to a site outside of its active site. Four copies of the CTP synthetase protein must work together before this enzyme can turn UTP into CTP. The enzyme also forms much larger aggregates, or polymers; however, it is not clear what causes these polymers to form, or what they do in a cell."

Furthermore, CTP encourages the polymers to form, whilst UTP and ATP cause them to disassemble. Therefore, this enzyme is least active when there is excess product in the cell, and most active when its substrates are plentiful."

However, the enzymes in the polymer appear to be locked into a shape that makes them unable to carry out their function. When Barry et al. then mutated the enzyme so that it was unable to form polymers it was also no longer inactivated in the same way by CTP. Bacterial cells with only these mutant versions of CTP synthetase are unable to properly control their levels of CTP. This suggests that polymer formation is important for regulating this enzyme in response to a build up of its product. Further work is needed to see whether the regulation of CTP synthetase activity by forming polymers is specific to this enzyme or a widespread mechanism that is used to control other enzymes too."

Recent studies suggest that some enzymes can also form large, higher-order polymers in which dozens to hundreds of subunits assemble into filaments (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barry and Gitai, 2011</a>). For most of these structures, we lack an understanding of both the regulation and functional significance of their polymerization. To address these questions, we focused on the assembly of CTP synthetase (CtpS), an essential and universally conserved metabolic enzyme. CtpS forms large, micron-scale filaments in a wide variety of bacterial and eukaryotic species (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ingerson-Mahar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Liu, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Noree et al., 2010</a>), but the structure of these polymers, what triggers their formation, and the relationship between CtpS polymerization and enzymatic activity were unknown until now."

                                "text": "Because CtpS filament formation is conserved between divergent organisms, we hypothesized that CtpS polymerization may regulate its conserved enzymatic function. We therefore designed a system to simultaneously monitor the assembly and activity of purified <i>E. coli</i> CtpS. We used a fluorometer to assay CtpS assembly by right-angle light scattering and CtpS activity by the specific absorbance of its CTP product. CtpS assembly and activity were assayed across a range of enzyme concentrations in activity buffer containing saturating amounts of substrates (UTP, ATP, and glutamine) as well as GTP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (referred to as \u2018activity buffer\u2019 throughout the text) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). CtpS protein was first pre-incubated in an incomplete activity buffer without glutamine to favor active tetramer formation. CTP production was then initiated by the addition of glutamine to form a complete activity buffer. The formation of well-ordered filaments was confirmed by negative stain electron microscopy (EM) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Interestingly, at CtpS levels where robust changes in light scattering are observed (above approximately 1\u20132 \u03bcM), CtpS activity (determined by the rate of CTP production per enzyme) sharply decreases (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>). This abrupt transition in activity state supports the hypothesis that there is a threshold for polymerization and that polymerization is inhibitory. Noise and nonlinearity in the light scattering data make it difficult to determine an exact critical concentration value. However, based on correlation between light scattering and CTP production changes, we predict the assembly threshold of CtpS to be approximately 1\u20132 \u03bcM. The cellular level of CtpS protein in <i>E. coli</i> grown in minimal media was measured at 2.3 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), indicating that the CtpS polymerization observed in vitro may be physiologically favorable<i>.</i>"

                                "text": "To determine if polymerization indeed inhibits CtpS activity, we assayed the activity of polymers purified by ultracentrifugation. The polymer-containing pellet was least enzymatically active immediately after centrifugation and CtpS activity increased as the polymers in the pellet disassembled (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 4 and 5</a>). CtpS polymers are thus inactive or much less than maximally active and polymerization is readily reversible. We directly demonstrated the reversibility of CtpS assembly and inactivation by first allowing CtpS to polymerize in activity buffer (with all substrates present) and then adding 1 mM UTP and ATP. Upon addition of these substrate nucleotides, we observed a sharp decrease in light scattering that corresponded to a sharp increase in CtpS activity. This transition was followed by a gradual increase in light scattering and corresponding decrease in activity back to the initial residual level (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Control experiments confirmed that the decrease in CtpS polymerization was not due to mechanical disruption by substrate addition (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The correlation between the decrease in light scattering and the initiation of CTP production at the time of substrate addition indicates that substrate addition leads to rapid depolymerization and subsequent enzyme reactivation. Immediately after this point, we observed an increase in both CTP levels and polymerization. We therefore conclude that polymerized CtpS enzymes are inactive and must disassociate from the polymer to resume normal enzymatic activity. Despite the fact that polymerization occurs in a buffer containing substrates, polymerization only occurs with CTP production, suggesting that polymerization is triggered not by the initial substrates, but rather by the accumulation of CTP product."

We then directly tested our hypothesis that CtpS's product, CTP, a known inhibitor of CtpS activity, stimulates CtpS polymerization. In the absence of substrates (UTP, ATP, and glutamine), incubation with CTP caused CtpS to polymerize (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The threshold concentration for robust changes in light scattering by CtpS with saturating CTP (1\u20132 \u03bcM CtpS; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) agrees with the threshold concentration in the presence of substrates (1\u20132 \u03bcM CtpS; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result suggests that CTP alone is sufficient to influence polymerization and that the substrates and any other products of the enzymatic reaction are not necessary. To confirm that CTP stimulates CtpS assembly, we used ultracentrifugation as an independent assembly assay. Titrating with increasing amounts of CTP caused an increase in the amount of CtpS found in the pellet with respect to the 0 mM CTP condition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

When added to activity buffer, DON abolishes both CTP production and CtpS polymerization (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). However, DON-treated CtpS can still polymerize when CTP is added to the solution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Polymers formed in the presence of CTP and DON disassemble upon the addition of substrates but do not reform after substrate addition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), presumably because the DON-inhibited CtpS cannot produce additional CTP. DON treatment has no effect on CtpS polymerization when the enzyme is incubated with saturating CTP (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1 and 5</a>). These results suggest that competition between substrate (UTP) and product (CTP) binding controls the polymerization equilibrium of CtpS. The dependence of polymerization on CTP levels may explain why DON treatment abolishes in vivo CtpS assembly in some cellular contexts (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ingerson-Mahar et al., 2010</a>) but not others (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2011</a>)."

This observation rules out occlusion of active sites as a regulatory mechanism. An alternative mechanism of CtpS inhibition is blocking the transfer of ammonia between the GATase and ALase active sites, which are separated by \u223c25 \u00c5. The detailed mechanism of ammonia transfer is unknown, but likely involves a conformational rearrangement in the vicinity of a putative channel that connects the two domains (<a href=\"#bib9\">Endrizzi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Goto et al., 2004</a>). One prediction is that a conformational change, induced by UTP and ATP binding, rotates the GATase domain toward the ALase domain to create a shorter channel between the active sites (<a href=\"#bib14\">Goto et al., 2004</a>). Such a large-scale rotation would be unattainable in the steric environment of the filament, as it would lead to clashing of the moving GATase domain with an adjacent CtpS tetramer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>).

Two discrete segments constitute the novel filament assembly contacts: the linker region \u03b1-helix 274\u2013284, and the short \u03b1-helix 330\u2013336 of the GATase domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Though the exact amino acid sequences at the inter-tetramer assembly interfaces are not well conserved, relative to the rest of CtpS, both sites feature many charged or hydrophobic residues available for potential polymerization stabilization across species (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We previously demonstrated that in <i>E. coli</i>, an mCherry-CtpS fusion faithfully reproduces the filamentous localization of native CtpS (as assayed by immunofluorescence) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ingerson-Mahar et al., 2010</a>). As an initial screen for CtpS assembly, we therefore introduced four mutations in the linker region \u03b1-helix and surrounding residues (E277R, F281R, N285D, and E289R) into mCherry-CtpS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)<i>.</i> All four polymerization interface mutants disrupted mCherry-CtpS localization, exhibiting a diffuse localization pattern rather than linear filaments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

This behavior was in stark contrast to wild-type CtpS, whose activity plummeted to 4% of its maximum. Thus, at low enzyme concentrations, CtpS<sup>E277R</sup> exhibited slightly lower activity than wild type while at high enzyme concentrations CtpS<sup>E277R</sup> activity was significantly greater than that of wild type. One explanation for the comparatively modest decrease in CtpS<sup>E277R</sup> activity as a function of enzyme concentration is that CtpS<sup>E277R</sup> produces CTP, which at high CtpS concentrations can accumulate and competitively inhibit CtpS activity, resulting in a slight activity decrease. However, this mutant lacks the dramatic reduction in CtpS activity mediated by large-scale assembly into filaments. As predicted from thermodynamic linkage, the inability to polymerize also leads CtpS<sup>E77R</sup> to bind CTP less tightly, with a higher IC50 value than the wild-type enzyme (830 \u03bcM vs 360 \u03bcM at 200 nM enzyme, <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data are thus consistent with the model that CtpS is negatively regulated in two ways: CTP competitively inhibits UTP binding, and large-scale assembly sterically hinders a conformational change required for CtpS activity. The quantitative differences between wild type and CtpS<sup>E277R</sup> activity suggest that large-scale assembly mediates rapid and efficient inhibition of enzymatic activity."

We hypothesized that if disruption of CtpS polymerization disrupts negative feedback, then CtpS<sup>E277R</sup> should maintain high CtpS activity despite the accumulation of C13-CTP from supplementation with C13-cytidine."

In wild type cells, as the C13-CTP pool increased, the fraction of C12-CTP sharply decreased (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Thus, feedback regulation mechanisms compensate for the increased CTP production from cytidine by reducing de novo CTP production by CtpS. The decrease in the fraction of unlabeled CTP was less pronounced in the CtpS<sup>E277R</sup> mutant and by the end of the period assayed, unlabeled CTP levels were almost twofold higher in the CtpS<sup>E377R</sup> strain than in wild type (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This result supports our conclusion that CtpS<sup>E277R</sup> hyperactivates CtpS by disrupting its negative feedback regulation and that this hyperactivation more than compensates for its reduced enzymatic activity. Since disruption of just one interaction in the proposed polymerization interface weakened the ability of CtpS to control CTP production even when all other forms of CtpS regulation are unaltered, we predict that any disruption of regions of inter-tetrameric contact, either by changes to the protein sequence or by chemical perturbation, would cause this deleterious regulatory defect."

To quantitatively assess the impact of polymerization-mediated enzymatic inhibition, we developed a simple mathematical model of CtpS inhibition by CTP-dependent polymerization (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> for details). A key point of the model is that the concentration of CtpS needed for polymerization depends on the free energy of polymerization, which in turn depends on the UTP and CTP concentrations. One mechanism for how CTP induces reversible polymerization is by CTP binding more favorably to the filament than to the free tetramer. This model leads to two predictions dictated by thermodynamic linkage: (1) CTP should be a more effective inhibitor at CtpS concentrations that favor polymer formation, and (2) the presence of CTP should enhance polymer formation and the reduction in CtpS specific activity (<i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub>) as CtpS concentration increases. Indeed, at 4 \u03bcM CtpS, near the concentration at which CtpS <i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub> is one half of its maximum due to polymerization ([CtpS]<sub>0.5</sub>, 3.3 \u03bcM, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), the CTP IC50 value is reduced to 170 \u03bcM, compared to 360 \u03bcM at 200 nM enzyme (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Conversely, in the presence of 800 \u03bcM CTP, the [CtpS<sub>0.5</sub>] value is 1.4 \u03bcM, reduced by more than half compared to that with no CTP (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Interestingly, the presence of 400 \u03bcM CTP has only a small effect ([CtpS]<sub>0.5</sub> = 2.8 \u03bcM) , suggesting an ultrasensitive response of polymerization to CTP levels."

The conformational differences between the free and filament forms of CtpS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) may play a role in establishing this barrier. This barrier could result from the free energy change required to take the CtpS tetramer from a flexible \u2018free\u2019 state to more rigid \u2018filament\u2019 state upon the first assembly step of the polymer. Alternatively, dimerization of \u2018free\u2019 CtpS tetramers could allosterically influence one another to adopt the \u2018filament\u2019 conformation in a manner similar to one proposed for the cooperative polymerization of FtsZ (<a href=\"#bib29\">Miraldi et al., 2008</a>). Our mathematical model enables us to estimate this nucleation barrier from the average polymer length, yielding a value of order 9 k<sub>B</sub>T, where k<sub>B</sub>T is the thermal energy. Moreover, it demonstrates that coupling activity to polymerization with such a significant nucleation barrier represents a mechanism for generating extremely sharp transitions in enzyme activity."

We found that, among the mechanisms examined, the ones involving polymerization-based negative feedback yield the sharpest decrease in enzyme activity when CTP levels are increased, thereby enabling tight regulation of CTP production by CTP levels. Our estimate based on average CtpS filament length of the value of the nucleation energy yields extremely sharp transitions (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, where this estimate was used, and our discussion of response coefficients in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). This sharpness is apparent in comparing the concentration dependences of CtpS specific activity in the presence of CTP. The CTPS<sub>0.5</sub> value at 400 \u03bcM CTP is slightly shifted compared to no CTP. At 800 \u03bcM, the CtpS<sub>0.5</sub> value is substantially decreased and the curvature more concave (<a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Another crucial difference with respect to such simple cooperative inhibition is that the polymerization-based mechanism also mediates negative feedback on CtpS activity from CtpS levels (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Hence, this mechanism uniquely enables ultrasensitive regulation of CtpS activity by both CTP and CtpS concentrations. Additionally, sequestering CtpS tetramers into the inactive filament ensures the availability of a CtpS pool that can be rapidly reactivated, limited only by the polymer disassembly rate. Our biochemical data confirm that depolymerization and subsequent repolymerization can occur within seconds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), while investigation of the in vivo kinetics of CtpS filament assembly and disassembly presents an interesting subject for future study."

CtpS polymerization is cooperative, which we conclude based on light scattering dynamics, the long polymers observed by EM, and the large fraction of polymerized protein observed by sedimentation (if assembly were non-cooperative one should always observe more tetramers than polymers). CtpS polymerization inhibits CtpS activity. The polymerization of CtpS is stimulated by binding its product, CTP, and disrupted by binding its substrates, UTP and ATP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1E and 9</a>). Inter-tetramer interactions in the CtpS polymer sterically inhibit a conformational change that is thought to be necessary for CtpS activity, and mutations that disrupt polymerization disrupt CtpS regulation with significant impacts on cell growth and metabolism."

First, layering multiple levels of regulation results in robust regulatory control with a series of fail-safes that protects the cell from disregulated nucleotide levels. CtpS is a key node in nucleotide metabolism because it binds ATP, UTP, CTP, and GTP. We propose that strict regulation of nucleotide levels is so critical to controlled growth and division that CtpS evolved as a master switch to integrate information about nucleotide abundances and maintain their proper levels and proportions. Nucleotide biosynthesis is both energetically costly and controls the availability of raw materials for replication, transcription, and other biosynthetic pathways. Thus, coordinating biomass accumulation and cellular proliferation requires extremely tight control of nucleotide levels via CtpS that no one regulatory mechanism could achieve on its own. The need for such tight regulation could also explain recent observations that small CtpS polymers can combine to form higher-order larger structures (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gou et al., 2014</a>) and can co-localize with other proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib4\">Carcamo et al., 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "The second advantage of employing multiple types of regulation is that each regulatory strategy has distinct kinetics that together enables regulation over a wide range of potential conditions. For example, transcriptional regulation is slow in comparison to regulation by ligand binding. Competitive or allosteric regulation by ligand binding can be cooperative if the enzymes form oligomers, as in the case of hemoglobin (<a href=\"#bib34\">Perutz, 1989</a>). However, the amassed activity of such oligomers is strictly linear with respect to protein concentration. By contrast, our modeling indicates that coupling activity to ligand-induced polymerization is a simple mechanism for promoting cooperativity with respect to protein concentration, while at the same time maintaining cooperativity with respect to ligand binding. An added benefit of polymerization-mediated inhibition is that it enables cells to sequester CtpS in an activity-primed tetramer state such that CtpS can be rapidly reactivated in a manner limited only by enzyme depolymerization (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Previous models for enzyme sequestration have relied on the idea of preventing substrate binding (e.g., [<a href=\"#bib19\">Jackson-Fisher et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Michaelis and Gitai, 2010</a>]). Here, we propose an alternate mechanism for sequestration where the active sites can readily access substrates but conformational changes required for activity are restricted. While our data are consistent with the model of cooperative regulation by assembly, experimental noise and nonlinearities limit the current ability to measure the extent of that cooperativity, raising the possibility that there are yet more undiscovered features of CtpS regulation. As methods for manipulating and monitoring nucleotide levels become more available, it will also be interesting to determine the kinetics of the various CtpS regulatory mechanisms in vivo."

In particular, we predict that enzymes that function at key metabolic nodes would most benefit from the ultrasensitive regulation provided by polymerization. Such cooperative assembly can coordinate the mobilization or sequestration of functional units, thereby dynamically altering the level of active enzyme without altering the overall enzyme concentration. The ultrasensitive kinetics of this transition would allow cells to rapidly respond to short-term changes in their environment or metabolic needs. For example, immediately following cell division, daughter cells could depolymerize any CtpS filaments inherited to compensate for reduced CtpS concentrations (perhaps from unequal partitioning) faster than translating and folding new proteins. The rapid kinetics of polymerization could sequester CtpS when CTP is plentiful to prevent futile biosynthesis. A handful of other metabolic enzymes have been shown to form filamentous or large scale structures in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barry and Gitai, 2011</a>). CtpS may thus emerge as a model for a larger class of enzymes that are regulated by higher-order assembly to achieve cooperative enzyme activation or inactivation."

Specifically, we hypothesize that actin and hexokinase may have shared a common ancestor that, like CtpS, evolved polymerization as a regulatory mechanism. Gene duplication and divergence may have subsequently enabled actin to specialize as a structural element, while additional layers of enzymatic regulation may have obviated the need for hexokinase assembly (mammalian hexokinase does not polymerize).

Reaction was monitored at 37\u00b0C for 5 min in a QuantaMaster 40 Fluorometer (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ) equipped with photo multiplier tubes for both scattering and transmittance. Right angle light scattering at 405 nm with a 1 mM slit width detected polymerization, and transmittance at 291 nm with a 0.25-mM slit width detected CTP production with both values reported in arbitrary units. Reactions were performed in 150 \u03bcl samples. Polymerization was monitored for 3 min unless otherwise noted. Detection of light scattering and transmittance alternated with an integration time of 1 s. CTP production velocity (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>, \u03bcmol/s<i>)</i> was determined for the first 30 s of the reaction. CTP production was normalized by the concentration of CtpS enzyme in each sample.

Comparison yielded the presence of a scaling factor to be applied to the fluorometer data set to yield <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> ranges consistent with published data. Data were scaled to yield the same maximal <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> value for both data sets. The fold-change in activity over the concentrations was similar between the data sets.

When CTP was present, it was included in the ATP/UTP mixture. The reactions were initiated by mixing with 10 mM final glutamine and the absorbance at 291 nm measured. It was not possible to measure the rates of 277R above 8000 nM (19 \u00b5M/s) because the rate could not be reliably measured considering the dead time of the instrument and the procedure (\u223c5 s). The final reactions contain 0.1\u201325 mM NaCl from the enzyme storage stocks, but these concentrations of NaCl do not have noticeable effects on enzyme rate. The annealing step is critical for the highest specific activities from stocks stored frozen or at 4\u00b0C and is optimal at concentrations greater than 2 \u03bcM. From CTP inhibition experiments, the CTP IC50 value at 200 nM CtpS<sup>WT</sup>, 600 \u00b5M UTP, and 1.5 mM ATP was 360 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

CTF correction was achieved by applying a Wiener filter to the entire micrograph. Lengths of helix were defined in the boxer program of the EMAN software suite (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ludtke et al., 1999</a>). Overlapping segments were extracted from the CTF-corrected micrographs along the length of each helix. In total, 12,465 overlapping segments were extracted in 510 \u00d7 510 \u00c5 boxes, representing approximately 56,000 unique CtpS monomers. Segments were binned twofold prior to reconstruction, at a final pixel size of 1.64 \u00c5. Iterative helical real space reconstruction (IHRSR) was performed essentially as described by <a href=\"#bib8\">Egelman (2007)</a> and <a href=\"#bib36\">Sachse et al. (2007)</a>, using SPIDER (<a href=\"#bib12\">Frank, 1996</a>) for projection matching and back projection, and hsearch_lorentz (<a href=\"#bib7\">Egelman, 2000</a>) for refinement of helical symmetry parameters. A cylinder was used as the initial reference volume, and 30 rounds of iterative refinement were carried out at increasingly smaller angular increments (1.5\u00b0 in the final round). A preliminary reconstruction was performed imposing only helical symmetry, from which it was clear that the repeating helical subunit was the CtpS tetramer; in subsequent runs of IHRSR the local 2-2-2 point group symmetry of the CtpS tetramer was also enforced. Visualization of the cryo-EM reconstructions and rigid body fitting of the CtpS crystal structure into the EM map were performed in Chimera (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). The CtpS crystal structure monomer was initially fit as a single rigid body into the EM map, followed by local refinement of the fit treating the two domains and linker region as three separate rigid bodies. The final EM map was amplitude corrected using amplitudes from the atomic model."

However, I fail to see how the LS curve in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> can be fit with a threshold concentration different from zero. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> seems a bit better, but I doubt that a straight line fit would indicate a threshold with any statistical significance.

I believe the important signals at low concentration are just lost in the noise. There is a much stronger case for a threshold of enzyme activity. Both <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a> A make a reasonably convincing case that enzyme activity drops only after a 1-2 \u00b5M.

Also, although the LS indicates reassembly, there is no \u201ccorresponding decrease in activity\u201d. It actually remains at its peak value or shows a small steady increase.

This would seem to introduce an additional level of complexity to the kinetics, and it would seem important to see a couple of curves showing the kinetics of CTP production, say at high and low CtpS concentrations. Most important would be to know what level of CTP was produced at the 3 minute time point? Again we would need this for a high and low CtpS. Best to show some kinetic curves in SI."

However the points are erratic and might also be described as a single line from 0-20. I see error bars on only two points. I think it is impossible to judge a mechanism from this erratic LS data, and certainly a Cc is not convincing. The logarithmic plots in S1 don't help, since a Cc is best seen in a linear plot. The Figure caption is sloppy. It indicates a log plot in an inset (but it is in SI), and 1c is confusing.

This is likely to invite a more complex analysis, including the question of nucleation, but that should be a part of any conclusion about a Cc. At the very least we need to know that the LS and enzyme activity plotted are at steady state. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c,e</a> suggest that LS is still increasing at 3-5 minutes."

This direct connection was demonstrated by an elegant combination of structural work (TEM and cryoEM) and steady-state and dynamic in vitro polymerization studies. The authors then perform structure-guided mutagenesis to disrupt polymerization in vivo and demonstrate for one of these mutants that it is the inhibition that is removed (the mutant is not less active in CTP production).

If there were no threshold, then one would always observe more tetramers than dimers of tetramers, more dimers of tetramers than trimers of tetramers, etc. and thus the bulk of protein would be in tetramers and small oligomers of tetramers. The fact that we see such long polymers by EM and such a large fraction of protein in polymers by ultracentrifugation indicate that CtpS assembly is nucleation dependent and that there exists a critical concentration. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> attempts to measure that threshold concentration for polymerization, but due to the nonlinearity of assembly we are intentionally cautious in interpreting this measurement. Since this caveat was not clear, we have altered the text to refer to an assembly threshold (a qualitative description of the assembly behavior) rather than a critical concentration, which, as the reviewer notes, is associated with a specific quantitative definition. That said, we have made additional activity and assembly measurements at additional CtpS concentrations to improve the continuity of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and the new data are consistent with the conclusion that CtpS assembles cooperatively above a threshold of roughly 1 \u03bcM."
