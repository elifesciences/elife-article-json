Here, we report a neglected but important bioenergetic effect of mTOR inhibition in neurons. mTOR inhibition by rapamycin significantly preserves neuronal ATP levels, particularly when oxidative phosphorylation is impaired, such as in neurons treated with mitochondrial inhibitors, or in neurons derived from maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS) patient iPS cells with ATP synthase deficiency. Rapamycin treatment significantly improves the resistance of MILS neurons to glutamate toxicity. Surprisingly, in mitochondrially defective neurons, but not neuroprogenitor cells, ribosomal S6 and S6 kinase phosphorylation increased over time, despite activation of AMPK, which is often linked to mTOR inhibition. A rapamycin-induced decrease in protein synthesis, a major energy-consuming process, may account for its ATP-saving effect. We propose that a mild reduction in protein synthesis may have the potential to treat mitochondria-related neurodegeneration."

Here, we report a neglected but important bioenergetic effect of mTOR inhibition in neurons. mTOR inhibition by rapamycin significantly preserves neuronal ATP levels, particularly when oxidative phosphorylation is impaired, such as in neurons treated with mitochondrial inhibitors, or in neurons derived from maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS) patient iPS cells with ATP synthase deficiency. Rapamycin treatment significantly improves the resistance of MILS neurons to glutamate toxicity. Surprisingly, in mitochondrially defective neurons, but not neuroprogenitor cells, ribosomal S6 and S6 kinase phosphorylation increased over time, despite activation of AMPK, which is often linked to mTOR inhibition. A rapamycin-induced decrease in protein synthesis, a major energy-consuming process, may account for its ATP-saving effect. We propose that a mild reduction in protein synthesis may have the potential to treat mitochondria-related neurodegeneration."

Building proteins requires a supply of nutrients and appropriate levels of energy, and mammalian cells rely on a protein called mTOR to sense both nutrient availability and energy levels.

In contrast, a lack of nutrients and low energy levels inhibit mTOR, which slows down protein synthesis to help the cell to conserve vital resources."

The experiments made use of neurons that could be grown in the laboratory and which faithfully mimicked the problems observed in maternally inherited Leigh syndrome patients. In some experiments, healthy neurons were treated with chemicals that inhibit ATP production. In other experiments, cells collected from a maternally inherited Leigh syndrome patient were coaxed into becoming neurons. Signaling via mTOR was enhanced in both kinds of neurons. Zheng, Boyer et al. then treated the defective neurons with rapamycin, which led to a significant rise in ATP levels. The production of proteins also slowed down. This could explain the observed rise in ATP levels, as making proteins consumes a lot of energy."

Protein homeostasis is often distorted in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as well as PolyQ and other proteinopathies, making mTOR an attractive therapeutic target (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bov\u00e9 et al., 2011</a>). Studies from animal models support mTOR inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases, although several distinct beneficial mechanisms have been proposed. Rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, reduces neuronal cell death in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, and decreased synthesis of DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4) was proposed to provide the protective effect by maintaining AKT pro-survival phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Malagelada et al., 2010</a>). Rapamycin strongly suppresses degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in <i>Drosophila</i> with loss of function mutations of <i>PINK1</i> and <i>PARKIN</i>, genes in which mutations cause human early onset Parkinsonism; importantly, overexpression of 4E-BP, a protein synthesis inhibitor downstream of the mTORC1 pathway, also rescues neuronal degeneration in these fly mutants. Increased production of GSTS1, a detoxifying enzyme, was suggested to be the beneficial factor (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tain et al, 2009</a>). In a mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, deleting one mTOR allele decreases amyloid-\u03b2 deposits and ameliorates memory deficits possibly through enhanced autophagy (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caccamo et al., 2014</a>)."

Proteins causing neuronal degeneration often have either direct or indirect deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions. For example, \u03b1-synuclein inhibits mitochondrial fusion and causes mitochondrial fragmentation followed by a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and neuronal death (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kamp et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nakamura et al., 2011</a>). Pink1 and Parkin are critical in mitochondrial quality maintenance (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</a>). Amyloid precursor proteins accumulate in mitochondrial import channels, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction as a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology (<a href=\"#bib16\">Devi et al., 2006</a>). In Huntington's disease, mutant huntingtin also has detrimental effects on mitochondrial function (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zuccato et al., 2010</a>).

The delicate influence of ATP level on neuronal survival is best exemplified by maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS), a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disease, characterized by severe early childhood neurodegeneration. T8993G in <i>MT-ATP6</i>, encoding an ATP synthase subunit, is the most common mutation in MILS (<a href=\"#bib18\">Finsterer, 2008</a>). A unique feature of mtDNA disease is that disease severity is correlated with the mutation load, i.e., the percentage of mutated mitochondrial DNA copies (<a href=\"#bib58\">Taylor and Turnbull, 2005</a>). Higher than 90% <i>ATP6</i> T8993G causes MILS, whereas, 70~90% causes a less severe disease called NARP syndrome with symptoms, such as neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa, that gradually develop with age. In a cybrid study where patient platelets containing the T8993G mtDNA mutation were fused to human osteosarcoma cells devoid of mtDNA, ATP synthesis was found to be negatively correlated with the mutation load (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mattiazzi et al., 2004</a>), indicating that a moderate difference in ATP level can dictate disease severity and the extent of neuronal death."

Here, we show that rapamycin significantly preserves neuronal ATP levels, particularly when mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is impaired by mitochondrial inhibitors. To test the therapeutic potential of rapamycin on neurodegeneration due to energy deficiency, we developed an iPSC-based disease model of maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS), due to a T8993G mtDNA mutation in the <i>ATP6</i> gene. The MILS neurons exhibited energy defects and degenerative phenotypes consistent with patient clinical observations. Rapamycin treatment significantly alleviated ATP deficiency, reduced aberrant AMPK activation in MILS neurons and improved their resistance to glutamate toxicity. Mechanistically, MILS neurons and neurons treated with mitochondrial inhibitors all exhibited enhanced mTORC1 activity, signified by elevated ribosomal S6 and S6 kinase phosphorylation, indicating a causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction and mTOR signaling in neurons, and providing a rationale for treatment with rapamycin, which reduces protein synthesis, a major energy-consuming process."

After a 6\u2009hr rapamycin treatment of cultured wild type neurons differentiated from human neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) derived from H9 human ESCs, the ATP level was increased by ~13% compared to neurons treated with DMSO as control. FK-506 (tacrolimus) that binds FKBP12, which is also a rapamycin target protein, but inhibits calcineurin signaling rather than the mTOR pathway (<a href=\"#bib58\">Taylor et al., 2005</a>), did not change the ATP level (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Oligomycin treatment alone decreased neuronal ATP level to ~ 64% of that in neurons treated with DMSO, but strikingly, cotreatment with oligomycin plus rapamycin maintained the ATP level at ~86% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Consistent with the higher ATP level, neurons cotreated with rapamycin showed lower AMPK T172 phosphorylation, an indicator of cellular ATP deficiency, compared to treatment with oligomycin alone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Similar effects of rapamycin were observed in neurons treated with rotenone and antimycin-A; but, interestingly, rapamycin was not able to preserve ATP when neurons were treated with CCCP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). It should be noted that both oligomycin and rotenone/antimycin-A treatment reduce ATP production by directly inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation; in contrast, CCCP does so by uncoupling electron transport from ATP production, which not only reduces ATP production, but also stimulates oxidative phosphorylation and induces mitochondrial substrate burning and heat production. We suspect that this difference may account for the different effects of co-treatment with rapamycin. These data indicate that rapamycin can increase neuronal ATP levels and preserve cellular energy when oxidative phosphorylation is impaired."

We found an ~2-fold increase in ribosomal S6 and S6 kinase phosphorylation in neurons treated for 6\u2009hr with oligomycin or rotenone/antimycin-A, but not CCCP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,E and 1F</a>). Rapamycin only partially decreased mTOR S2481 phosphorylation as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hsu et al., 2011</a>), but almost completely abolished the ribosomal S6 and S6K phosphorylation observed in oligomycin-treated neurons, indicating its dependence on mTORC1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We did not observe a consistent change of mTOR phosphorylation at S2481 or S2448 (not shown) upon oligomycin or rotenone/antimycin-A treatment. The increased S6 and S6 kinase phosphorylation was not due to AMPK activation, as AICAR, an AMPK agonist, did not alter their phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In fact, AMPK activation is generally associated with decreased mTORC1 activity and S6K phosphorylation as a result of direct phosphorylation of Tsc2 and Raptor by AMPK (<a href=\"#bib23\">Inoki et al., 2003</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib20\">Gwinn et al, 2008</a>). Consistent with this, NPCs treated with oligomycin or rotenone/antimycin-A for 20\u2009min or for 6\u2009hr showed decreased S6 and S6K phosphorylation, increased phosphorylation of AMPK and its substrate, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H and 1I</a>). In contrast to the 6\u2009hr treatment, 20\u2009min of oligomycin or rotenone/antimycin-A treatment did not significantly alter S6 and S6K phosphorylation in neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that the increased S6 and S6K phosphorylation in neurons treated for 6\u2009hr with these mitochondria inhibitors is a neuron-selective response to some cumulative effect caused by mitochondrial dysfunction."

One consequence of rapamycin inhibition of mTORC1 is a decrease in protein synthesis, and to explore the potential ATP-saving effect of protein synthesis inhibition, neurons were treated for 2\u2009hr with cycloheximide (CHX), a widely-used protein synthesis inhibitor, and 4E1RCat, a protein synthesis initiation inhibitor that blocks eIF4E:eIF4G and eIF4E:4E-BP1 interactions (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cencic et al., 2011</a>), causing a drop in protein synthesis to ~ 9% and ~55% of that of neurons treated with DMSO as control, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Healthy control iPS cell lines were derived from BJ male human fibroblasts. Both the T8993G and BJ iPSCs had normal karyotypes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The mitochondrial genomes from these T8993G and BJ iPS cells were sequenced, and no major pathogenic mutations, apart from T8993G, were found compared to mitochondrial genome variation databases (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Subsequently, three neural progenitor cell lines (NPC) were derived from the respective patient iPS cell lines using the embryoid-body based protocol outlined in <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>. Expected neural progenitor markers were present by immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and all the T8993G NPC lines retained the T8993G mutation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Like the GM13411 fibroblasts, the derived iPSCs, NPCs and neurons all had an extremely high T8993G mtDNA mutation load (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The staining of neuronal differentiation markers and electrophysiological analysis of patient and BJ neurons is described in supplementary data; representative results for T8993G neurons were shown in <a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s8\">8</a>."

ROS responsive genes, such as <i>SOD1, GPX1</i> and <i>GSS</i>, were also up-regulated in T8993G NPCs and neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These data are consistent with the previous studies based on a cybrid model, in which the <i>ATP6</i> T8993G mutation was found to impair the proton passage through ATP synthase, which leads to higher mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS production (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cort\u00e9s-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Manfredi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mattiazzi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Trounce et al., 1994</a>). Extracellular flux analysis of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) revealed that iPSCs, NPCs and neurons containing T8993G mtDNA had a lower basal OCR but similar maximum OCR to controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,H and 2J</a>), mechanistically consistent with ATP synthase deficiency. Significantly more lactate was secreted by T8993G iPSCs and NPCs than controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G and 2I</a>), whereas T8993G neurons exhibited only a small increase in secreted lactate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). This result indicates enhanced aerobic glycolysis in proliferating T8993G cells. Recently, <a href=\"#bib33\">Ma et al. (2015)</a> reported the establishment of iPSCs from the same patient fibroblast line, which have metabolic phenotypes similar to our T8993G iPSC lines. Although they did not differentiate patient neurons from iPSCs, by using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology, they replaced the mutant mtDNA and generated corrected pluripotent stem cells, which had a normal metabolic profile, proving that the metabolic phenotypes observed in the patient iPSCs are due to mtDNA mutation."

The ATP level in MILS neurons dropped to ~73% of healthy control neurons, and, consistently, phosphorylation of AMPK T172, an indicator of ATP shortage, and its substrate ACC was significantly increased in T8993G neurons but not in T8993G NPCs, iPSCs and fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Similarly, oligomycin, an ATP synthase inhibitor, dramatically reduced ATP levels in wild-type neurons but less significantly in NPCs; and lactate levels increased significantly in NPCs but not neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These results are consistent with the fact that neurons mainly rely on mitochondria for energy production. Immunoblot analysis of representative enzymes in the glycolysis and TCA pathways, and mitochondrial respiratory complexes showed no major differences between T8993G and BJ control NPCs or neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Strikingly, however, neurons did not express detectable hexokinase (HK2) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) proteins, the two key enzymes supporting aerobic glycolysis (<a href=\"#bib14\">DeBerardinis and Thompson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dang, 2012</a>). Consistently, the production of lactate in wild type neurons was ~10 fold less than in NPCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Presumably, in iPSCs and NPCs, the increased production of lactate allows more NADH to be recycled to NAD<sup>+</sup>, which is required for the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and results in production of more glycolytic ATP. Without LDHA and HK2, neurons appear unable to compensate for the mitochondrial ATP deficiency through aerobic glycolysis. Moreover, the data also argue that even when short of energy, neurons cannot turn on aerobic glycolysis, at least in MILS neurons. In spite of ATP deficiency in T8993G neurons, we did not detect enhanced autophagy (data not shown), probably due to mTOR activation, which suppresses autophagy. Moreover, there was no marked increase in mitochondrial mass in T8993G neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), indicating that mitochondrial biogenesis was not deployed to compensate for cellular energy deficiency."

                                "text": "T8993G neurons showed finer neuronal fibers than control neurons, and bead-like structures along the T8993G axons were more common (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and 4B</a>). Neurons at 3 and 8-weeks of differentiation retained the homoplasmic T8993G mutation of the parental GM13411 fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The bead-like structures, known as neuritic beading, are focal swellings in the axons and dendrites of neurons, which occur upon intracellular ATP decrease (<a href=\"#bib56\">Takeuchi et al., 2005</a>). Mitochondrial dysfunction increases neuronal vulnerability to form neuritic beading (<a href=\"#bib19\">Greenwood et al., 2007</a>). To challenge the MILS neurons with energy demanding stress, we used a glutamate toxicity assay. Glutamate overdosage is toxic to neurons through two mechanisms - excessive stimulation of neuronal activity and non-receptor oxidative toxicity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rothman, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Murphy et al., 1989</a>). ATP deficiency is the primary trigger for neuronal toxicity caused by glutamate overdosage (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nicholls et al., 2007</a>). T8993G neurons were hypersensitive to increased levels of extracellular glutamate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and 4E</a>). In neurons expressing GFP driven by the neuron-specific DCX promoter to highlight neuronal structures, a 6-h treatment with 100 \u00b5M glutamate abolished neuronal processes in T8993G neurons, whereas the neuronal fibers from control neurons, differentiated from BJ iPSCs or H9 hESCs, remained intact, and could tolerate up to 300 \u00b5M glutamate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and 4H</a>). After a 3-h treatment, neuronal fibers, containing multiple neuritic beadings, were already apparent in T8993G neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Consistently, neuronal ATP levels dropped during glutamate treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). To confirm this observation, we used oligomycin, an ATP synthase inhibitor to mimic the defect caused by the <i>ATP6</i> T8993G mutation. By measuring the basal OCRs with different concentration of oligomycin, 40 nM was found to partially inhibit ATP synthase (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Wild type neurons treated with 40 nM oligomycin became sensitive to 100 \u00b5M glutamate similar to MILS neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H and 4I</a>), and neuronal ATP levels fell consistent with their sensitivities to glutamate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>)."

Consistent with our previous observations, ATP5A1-depleted neurons but not NPCs showed increased S6 and S6K phosphorylation similar to T8993G cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). ATP5A1-depeleted neurons at 3-weeks of differentiation already showed a significant number of beaded neuronal processes compared to neurons infected with scramble control shRNA, and the ATP level of ATP5A-depeleted neurons was only ~60% of the neurons transduced with scramble control shRNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Twelve-hr treatment of rapamycin increased ATP level by ~26% and greatly decreased the number of beaded neuronal processes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G, 5H and 5I</a>). Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, also had effects comparable to rapamycin in preventing beading (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>).

                                "text": "To understand the mechanism through which long term treatment with oligomycin or MILS ATPase deficiency results in elevated mTORC1 activity, we defined the metabolic profiles of MILS neurons, by measuring representative glycolytic and TCA metabolites and amino acids using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The levels of 19 amino acids were quantified; we were unable to measure the level of arginine due to instability. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, the overall levels of amino acids in MILS neurons were increased compared to healthy control neurons: 14 amino acids showed significant increase; alanine, asparagine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine and valine increased by ~40 to 80%; cysteine and threonine increased by ~100%; and, glycine increased by 340%. Pyruvate and lactate levels in MILS neurons were two-fold higher, and the TCA intermediates in MILS neurons were also increased; citrate was ~200% of that in control neurons, \u03b1-ketoglutarate was ~180%, and succinate was ~140%, whereas fumarate and malate were comparable to the control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These data are consistent with the <i>ATP6</i> T8993G mutation defect, which decreases mitochondrial electron transport chain activity, resulting in decreased usage of TCA and glycolytic metabolites. The increased intracellular amino acids levels in MILS neurons may also be attributable to the accumulated glycolytic intermediates and a clogged TCA cycle, because the synthesis and catabolism of amino acids is linked to glycolysis and the TCA cycle; under catabolic conditions the carbon atoms of amino acids are oxidized by the TCA cycle for ATP production (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stryer et al., 2002</a>). Since the mTORC1 complex is a sensor of cellular nutrition, and can be activated by amino acids (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bar-Peled and Sabatini, 2014</a>), we suspect that the observed enhancement of neuronal mTORC1 activity after prolonged mitochondrial OXPHOS inhibition is due to the accumulated amino acids or other nutrients that activate mTORC1."

Similar to MILS neurons, neurons treated with these mitochondrial drugs showed higher levels of amino acids, pyruvate and lactate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D and 6E</a>); although there are some notable differences between mitochondrial inhibitor-treated neurons and MILS neurons. For example, the extent of glycine increase in inhibitor-treated neurons is not as pronounced as in MILS neurons. These differences may be due to the difference in mechanism or extent of mitochondrial inhibition between mitochondrial inhibitors and <i>ATP6</i> T8993G mutation. The large increase of glycine in MILS neurons may be an anti-oxidant response to chronic mitochondrial oxidative stress. In the mitochondrial matrix, serine is converted to glycine catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), a reaction coupled with covalent linkage of tetrahydrofolate to a methylene group to form 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate, which is subsequently used to generate 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate and NADPH by tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) in mitochondria. The NADPH produced through this serine catabolism pathway maintains mitochondrial redox by regenerating the reduced forms of glutathione and thioredoxin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fan et al, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lewis et al, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mart\u00ednez-Reyes I and Chandel, 2014</a>), and is critical for tumor survival (<a href=\"#bib66\">Ye et al, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">DeNicola et al, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al, 2015</a>). In MILS neurons, the expression of <i>SHMT2, MTHFD2</i> and other enzymes in the <i>de novo</i> serine synthesis pathway were significantly higher than in control healthy neurons, supporting our hypothesis (unpublished data). We are currently investigating the role of this pathway in neuronal survival under mitochondrial stress. On the other hand, this accumulated glycine can be used to synthesize glutathione itself."

A recent study reported a dramatic therapeutic effect of rapamycin on a mouse model of Leigh syndrome, deficient in NDUFS4, a component of complex I (<a href=\"#bib25\">Johnson et al., 2013b</a>). The exact rescue mechanism is unclear, but increased autophagy or upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis seem not be involved. Here, we demonstrated that rapamycin treatment significantly preserved neuronal ATP level, particularly when oxidative phosphorylation was impaired, revealing an important beneficial mechanism of rapamycin. To test its therapeutic potential on neurodegeneration resulting from energy deficiency, we developed an iPSC-based disease model of maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS), an infantile neurodegenerative disease with a complex V (ATP synthase) defect due to mitochondrial DNA mutation. Rapamycin treatment significantly alleviated the ATP deficiency, reduced aberrant AMPK activation in MILS neurons, and improved their resistance to glutamate toxicity. Strikingly, ribosomal S6 and S6K phosphorylation, indicators of mTORC1 activity, were increased in neurons treated for a significant time with mitochondrial inhibitors and in MILS neurons, arguing that enhanced mTORC1 signaling might be a frequent feature of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons."

                                "text": "Our observation that in mitochondrially-defective neurons mTORC1 activity increased, rather than decreased concurrent with AMPK activation is contrary to previous reports that pharmacological disruption of mitochondrial function leads to mTORC1 inhibition due to AMPK activation by reduced energy levels (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zoncu et al., 2011</a>). In proliferating NPCs, we did find that mitochondrial inhibitors activated AMPK and, consistently, decreased S6 and S6K phosphorylation. Activation of mTORC1 in neurons with mitochondrial dysfunction takes several hours, and appears to be a slow response to some cumulative effect caused by mitochondria dysfunction. This paradoxical observation could be due to unknown differences in the mTORC1 complex between NPCs and neurons. We found that AKT Ser473 phosphorylation was dramatically decreased in wild type neurons compared to NPCs, as was phosphorylation of its substrate PRAS40 at Thr246 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). PRAS40 is an inhibitor of mTORC1 signaling, and its overexpression has been shown to inhibit mTORC1 hyperactivation in <i>Tsc2</i> -/- mutant cells, with AKT-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40 preventing its inhibition of mTORC1 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sancak et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vander Haar et al., 2007</a>). An alternative explanation for mTORC1 activation emerged from our metabolite analysis, which showed that MILS neurons and neurons treated with mitochondrial drugs had significantly higher levels of amino acids, which can activate mTORC1. Indeed, it has been shown that the basal activity of S6 kinase rises progressively with increased concentration of medium amino acids in a nearly linear fashion; and at a 2-fold increased concentration, S6 kinase activity is close to maximal and no longer shows further activation by growth factors (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hara et al, 1998</a>). Therefore, the increased amino acid levels in MILS neurons or mitochondria-inhibitor treated neurons are significant, and may account for the elevated mTORC1 activity. Certainly, there are other possible mechanisms; for instance, the effect might be due to decreased S6 and S6K phosphatase activity."

(2012)</a> demonstrated that after detachment AMPK is activated in both K-Ras V12-transformed and non-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts; interestingly, mTORC1 activity only decreased, in an AMPK-dependent manner, in transformed but not non-transformed fibroblasts. They further showed that this AMPK-mediated mTORC1 inhibition decreased protein synthesis, thus preserving ATP in the detached transformed fibroblasts and delaying cell death. As in our study, rapamycin or cycloheximide treatment had a significant cell survival effects in their model. Notably, in the transformed fibroblasts, the level of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation was markedly stronger than in non-transformed cells, reminiscent of the situation in NPCs and neurons."

In the MILS neurons, S6 and S6K phosphorylation were significantly higher than in BJ and H9 control neurons. Neuronal energy deficiency caused by mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in the presence of sufficient oxygen and ample nutrition, a situation that cells in vivo rarely encounter, and there is probably no selection pressure to evolve a proper response program. We believe that the recovery of protein synthesis in such situations is an improper response that further aggravates energy deficiency. Therefore, manipulating protein synthesis to match ATP production is beneficial for neurons. Hints exist in the work of others. Overexpression of 4E-BP, a negative regulator of protein synthesis, rescues the neuronal degeneration observed in Pink1 and Parkin fly mutants with mitochondrial defects (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tain et al., 2009</a>); in light of our finding, an alternative explanation is that reduction of protein synthesis is energetically beneficial for neurons with mitochondrial dysfunction. Strikingly, pathogenic LRRK2 mutation in Parkinson's disease has recently been found to induce a large increase in protein synthesis in a <i>Drosophila</i> model, and, when treated with a low-dose of the anisomycin protein synthesis inhibitor, the locomotor deficits and dopamine neuron loss in mutant LRRK2 transgenic flies were rescued (<a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2014</a>). Notably, a recent genetic screen in yeast also revealed that downregulation of protein synthesis could rescue the growth of mutant cells with mitochondrial defects (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wang and Chen, 2015</a>)."

In contrast, carriers with a ~50% load are generally normal, only developing late-onset cone-rod dystrophy in their forties (<a href=\"#bib47\">Porto et al., 2001</a>). In a cybrid study, where patient platelets containing the T8993G mtDNA mutation were fused to human osteosarcoma cells devoid of mtDNA, mitochondrial ATP production was found to be negatively correlated with the mutation load in a nearly linear fashion (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mattiazzi et al., 2004</a>). In this study, we found that rapamycin treatment of T8993G neurons increased ATP level and improved their resistance to glutamate-induced neuronal fiber collapse, a process caused by decreased intracellular ATP (<a href=\"#bib56\">Takeuchi et al., 2005</a>). Therefore, a ~20% increase in ATP, the amount saved by rapamycin, which may seem small, could indeed have a significant effect on neuronal survival in Leigh or NARP syndrome patients."

In one fourth of the cases, these mutations occur in mitochondrial DNA (<a href=\"#bib18\">Finsterer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pinto and Moraes, 2014</a>). The neurological degenerative phenotypes are usually apparent in newborns, but, currently, no effective therapy is available. <a href=\"#bib25\">Johnson et al. (2013b)</a> reported a dramatic therapeutic effect of rapamycin on a mouse model of Leigh syndrome. We also observed beneficial effects of rapamycin in human neurons treated with mitochondria inhibitors and in an iPSC-based disease model of maternally inherited Leigh syndrome. However, potential negative effects of rapamycin on neuronal development should not be neglected. A previous study found that focal infusion of rapamycin into dorsal hippocampus blocks axon fiber sprouting, but it should be noted that such a treatment is unable to reverse already established axon organization (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buckmaster et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, we suggest that long-term usage of rapamycin for newborns should be considered with caution, but could be tried on older NARP syndrome patients to delay disease progression, and short term rapamycin usage could be considered for younger Leigh patients in emergency situations, such as fever, which often drastically and irreversibly worsens the neurodegenerative symptoms (<a href=\"#bib62\">Uziel et al., 1997</a>). Besides these hereditary mitochondrial diseases, mitochondrial dysfunctions are frequently observed in neurodegenerative diseases (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lin and Beal, 2006</a>). Elevated p70 S6 kinase activity has been documented in the brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease patients (<a href=\"#bib3\">An et al., 2003</a>).

GM13411 primary fibroblasts derived from a male\u00a0MILS syndrome patient were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research. BJ fibroblasts were from the ATCC. Fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1x Glutamax, 5 ng/ml FGF2. Fibroblasts from one well of a six-well dish were infected with retrovirus expressing <i>OCT4, SOX2, KLF4</i>, and <i>MYC</i>, and after 2 days, were split onto a 10\u00a0cm plate containing 1 million mitotically-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs). The growth medium was switched to DMEM/F12 supplemented with 20% knockout serum replacement, 1\u2009mM L-glutamine, 0.1\u2009mM non-essential amino acids, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 10 ng ml<sup>\u22121</sup> FGF2 for the 21\u201328 days of reprogramming. hiPSC colonies were picked and cultured onto 24-well plates coated with inactivated mEFs. hiPSCs were split through mechanic passaging with a glass pipet at early passages, while at higher passages, hiPSC could be grown on Matrigel and enzymatically digested with dispase. Karyotyping analysis was performed by Cell Line Genetics (Wisconsin, MD)."

The cell clumps were then transferred to ultra-low attachment plates. After growth in suspension for 1 week in N2/B27 medium, aggregates form embryoid bodies, which were then transferred onto polyornithine (PORN)/laminin-coated plates and developed into neural rosettes in N2/B27 medium.

Specifically, the authors show that cells treated with mitochondrial poisons show increased mTOR signaling and reduced ATP levels that can be rescued by rapamycin treatment. They further show that inhibition of protein synthesis in these cells can partially phenocopy rapamycin by rescuing ATP levels. They go on to describe an iPSC model of Leigh Syndrome in which they observe increased mTOR signaling. They show that treatment with rapamycin can improve some cellular phenotypes, in particular rescuing ATP levels, and propose that this is mediated through inhibition of protein synthesis."

In a separate project to investigate metabolic changes during differentiation of neural progenitor cells into neurons we analyzed the effect of constitutive expression of HK2 and LDHA during neuronal differentiation, and these data will be included in another manuscript describing the metabolic transition from neural progenitor cells to post-mitotic neurons. The data are shown in Author response image 1. In brief, we stably transduced neural progenitor cells (NPCs) with constitutively expressed HK2 and LDHA; ~80% of NPCs had discernible expression and proliferation appeared normal. However, constitutive HK2 and LDHA expression during neuronal differentiation led to extensive cell death and significantly increased GFAP-positive glial cells from 4% of total cells in the control NPC cells containing expression vector alone to ~40% of total cells. The LDHA signals were readily detected in GFAP-positive glial cells but not in MAP2-positive neurons. Importantly, the dead cells signified by condensed nuclei were associated with punctate staining of LDHA and MAP2, a neuronal marker, indicating that neurons were sensitive to HK2 and LDHA re-expression. At the moment, we do not fully understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon. We agree with the reviewer's point, and have changed the phrase according to their suggestion."
