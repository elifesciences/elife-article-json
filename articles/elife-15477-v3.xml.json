In the <i>C. elegans</i> germline, reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation. Here, we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway. This is surprising, since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors. Through a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes, we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch. We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes, silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming. These findings have wide implications, ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling."

In the <i>C. elegans</i> germline, reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation. Here, we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway. This is surprising, since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors. Through a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes, we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch. We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes, silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming. These findings have wide implications, ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling."

Upon inhibition of Notch signaling, the oncogenic genes KLF4 and cMyc become dispensable for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mouse and human keratinocytes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ichida et al., 2014</a>). In this setting, Notch inhibits reprograming. Conversely, Notch signaling promotes transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells to ductal cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sawey et al., 2007</a>), or the conversion of hepatocytes into biliary cells in liver primary malignancy intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sekiya and Suzuki, 2012</a>). Notch signaling can also affect reprograming in normal development. In <i>C. elegans</i>, signaling through the GLP-1 and LIN-12 Notch receptors impedes reprograming during embryogenesis and, during larval development, signaling through LIN-12 is required for the conversion of a rectal epithelial cell into a motorneuron (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jarriault et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Djabrayan et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "The role of epigenetic regulators in cell-fate decisions has been studied mostly in pluripotent cells cultured outside of their normal tissue environment (<a href=\"#bib47\">Meshorer and Misteli, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Spivakov and Fisher, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lessard and Crabtree, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Orkin and Hochedlinger, 2011</a>). Therefore, the\u00a0epigenetic regulation of stem cell identity in intact tissues remains poorly understood. Additionally, the impact of external cues, for example signaling from a stem cell niche to the recipient cell\u2019s chromatin remains equally unresolved. By contrast, <i>C. elegans</i> has been used as a model to study reprograming in an intact organism (<a href=\"#bib27\">Horner et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fukushige et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fukushige and Krause, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ciosk et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jarriault et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yuzyuk et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Riddle et al., 2013</a>). In this model, germ cells can be directly reprogrammed into neurons by depleting specific chromatin modifiers such as LIN-53 (Rbbp4/7) or components of PRC2, and by concomitant overexpression of the transcription factor CHE-1, which induces glutamatergic neuronal fate in a process which we refer to as Germ cell Conversion (GeCo) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tursun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Patel et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "Here, we identify the Notch signaling pathway as a critical player in this reprograming model. This was unanticipated, since signaling through the Notch receptor GLP-1 (henceforth GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>) from the somatic gonadal niche is known to maintain germline stem cell/progenitor fate (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kimble and Crittenden, 2007</a>). To understand this novel, reprograming-promoting role of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>, we combined genetics with tissue-specific expression profiling. We identified genes regulated by GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>, including genes recently shown to maintain the germline stem/progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kershner et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, and unexpectedly, we found that many genes activated by GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling were also repressed by the cell fate-stabilizing chromatin regulator PRC2. We show that GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions and demonstrate co-regulation of their common target, <i>utx-1.</i> Importantly, UTX-1 is a histone demethylase known to erase the gene-silencing methylation of histone H3 dependent on PRC2 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Maures et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Vandamme et al., 2012</a>). Thus, we propose that the GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>\u2013dependent induction of UTX-1 facilitates reprograming by alleviating PRC2-mediated repression of alternative cell fates."

                                "text": "Germ cells can be converted into neuronal cells in intact <i>C. elegans</i> upon overexpression of the neuronal transcription factor CHE-1, simply by depleting the chromatin modifier LIN-53 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tursun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Patel et al., 2012</a>). This GeCo phenotype can be followed in living animals by monitoring a reporter GFP expressed from the <i>gcy-5</i> promoter, which otherwise is induced in glutamatergic ASE neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Altun-Gultekin et al., 2001</a>). In contrast to the spontaneous teratomatous differentiation of meiotic germ cells, observed in the absence of specific RNA-binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ciosk et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Biedermann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tocchini et al., 2014</a>), GeCo is preferentially observed in the pre-meiotic, proliferating germ cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tursun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Patel et al., 2012</a>). Consistently, removing the proliferating germ cells, by inhibiting GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling, prevents GeCo (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tursun et al., 2011</a>). However, because the proliferating germ cells were eliminated, these experiments did not address a possible direct effect of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling on GeCo. We began addressing this issue by examining the gonads of animals carrying the gain-of-function <i>glp-1</i> allele (<i>ar202</i>) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pepper et al., 2003</a>). These gonads are filled with proliferating germ cells and, upon depleting LIN-53 and overexpressing CHE-1, we observed that significantly more germ cells converted to ASE neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). We refer to this enhanced GeCo as 'GeCo+'. Detailed quantification revealed that the GeCo+ gonads contained more than twice the number of converted cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The nuclei of these converted cells were reminiscent of neuronal nuclei and the cells displayed axo-dendritic projection (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), as previously described (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tursun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Patel et al., 2012</a>). To confirm that the GeCo enhancement depends on the canonical Notch signaling pathway, rather than an independent function of the GLP-1<sup>Notch\u00a0</sup>receptor, we RNAi-depleted the transcriptional effector of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling, LAG-1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Christensen et al., 1996</a>). We exposed animals only after hatching to <i>lag-1</i> RNAi in order to avoid sterility, which is caused when animals are subjected to <i>lag-1</i> RNAi earlier (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplemental file 1</a>). RNAi-mediated knock-down of <i>lag-1</i> strongly inhibited GeCo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Importantly, under these experimental conditions, we did not observe any obvious reduction of germ cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>), suggesting a proliferation-independent effect of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling on cell-fate conversion. To investigate this further, we tested GeCo efficiency on germ cells proliferating independently of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling. We took advantage of mutants in which, in the absence of two meiosis/differentiation-promoting factors GLD-1 and GLD-2, germ cells proliferate independently of GLP-1<sup>Notch\u00a0</sup>(<a href=\"#bib32\">Kadyk and Kimble, 1998</a>). Specifically, we examined GeCo in the loss-of-function <i>gld-1(q497) gld-2(q485)</i> mutants, which carried either wild-type <i>glp-1</i> or the loss-of-function <i>glp-1(q175)</i> allele (<a href=\"#bib5\">Austin and Kimble, 1987</a>). Both mutant combinations have previously been described to have tumorous germlines and impaired meiotic entry (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kadyk and Kimble, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hansen et al., 2004</a>). In contrast to efficient GeCo observed in the <i>gld-1(q497) gld-2(q485)</i> gonads, GeCo was strongly diminished in the <i>gld-1(q497) gld-2(q485); glp-1(q175)</i> gonads, despite the ongoing germ cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Counting the number of germ cells in these gonads revealed only a slight difference (a 15% increase in the numbers in the double vs. triple mutant gonads), suggesting that the strong enhancement of GeCo by GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling cannot be explained by the\u00a0increased number of germ cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Since it has been proposed that dividing cells have a higher propensity for cellular reprograming (<a href=\"#bib13\">Egli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hanna et al., 2009</a>), we also tested whether blocking the cell cycle would affect the observed GeCo enhancement in <i>glp-1(gf)</i> gonads. As previously described (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fox et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Patel et al., 2012</a>), we used hydroxyurea (HU) treatment to block the cell cycle in the S phase. Blocking the cell cycle by HU did not diminish the GeCo+ phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Combined, these results suggest that GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> enhances GeCo independently from its role in promoting germ cell proliferation."

Consistent with the joint function of MES-2 and MES-6 in the PRC2 complex, a very similar set of genes was upregulated upon the loss of either protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>; henceforth \u2018PRC2 repressed\u2019 genes; also see (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gaydos et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, those PRC2-repressed genes overlapped strongly with Notch-activated genes, particularly those linked to the X chromosome. Nearly all of the X-linked Notch-activated genes were also derepressed upon the loss of PRC2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This is consistent with the observed genetic interaction and suggests that increased GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling can induce expression of specific PRC2-repressed genes. This activation of the PRC2-repressed genes is not due to a global loss of the repressive tri-methylation of Histone H3 at lysine residue 27 (H3K27me3), since, upon examining gonads of different GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> mutants, we observed no global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

The strongest suppression of the GeCo+ and GeCo phenotype was observed upon the depletion of <i>utx-1,</i> which also suppressed <i>mes-3</i> RNAi-mediated GeCo+ in <i>glp-1(ar202)\u00a0</i>gonads (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Depletion of two other candidates, the uncharacterized C07G1.6 and the aldolase ortholog <i>aldo-1</i>, also suppressed GeCo+, albeit less efficiently (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Because UTX-1 was suggested to effect gonadal development by functioning in the somatic gonad (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vandamme et al., 2012</a>), we re-examined GeCo efficiency upon <i>utx-1</i> RNAi in the <i>rrf-1 (pk1417)</i> background.

Because the suppression of GeCo+ upon <i>utx-1</i> RNAi was observed also in the <i>rrf-1</i> background, UTX-1 does not seem to enhance GeCo by functioning in the somatic gonad (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

However, a number of other H3K27me3 demethylases exist in <i>C. elegans,</i> which prompted us to test whether depletion of these demethylases might have an effect on GeCo in the <i>glp-1(ar202)</i> gonads.

To test the potential expression of <i>utx-1</i> in the germline, we constructed a strain expressing single copy-integrated, FLAG and GFP-tagged, functional UTX-1 (expressed from the endogenous <i>utx-1</i> promoter under the control of endogenous <i>utx-1</i> 3'UTR). We found that this protein was indeed expressed in the germline (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To examine the potential transcriptional regulation of <i>utx-1</i> expression by GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and PRC2, we also created a strain expressing GFP-tagged histone H2B from the <i>utx-1</i> promoter (<i>putx-1</i> reporter), under the control of an unregulated (<i>tbb-2</i>) 3\u2019UTR. This construct was also single-copy integrated into a defined genomic location. With both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the <i>putx-1</i> reporter, we expected expression patterns similar to that of other reported GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> target genes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lamont et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kershner et al., 2014</a>). Among these, <i>lst-1</i> and <i>sygl-1</i> account for the role of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> in stem cell maintenance, and both genes are expressed in the distal-most stem cells/progenitors (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kershner et al., 2014</a>). By contrast, both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the <i>putx-1</i> reporter were little or not expressed in the distal-most, proliferative part of the germline (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Concomitantly with progression through meiosis, their expression increased toward the proximal end of the gonad (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). When examining the existing mRNA hybridization patterns of Notch-activated and PRC2-repressed genes (33 genes), we noticed that half of these (18, all X-linked) are similarly expressed in the medial and/or proximal, but not the distal-most, gonads (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), arguing against direct transcriptional activation of these genes by GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> in the wild type. Nevertheless, in agreement with the expression analyses, we observed increased expression of the <i>putx-1</i> reporter in PRC2-depleted gonads; this increase occurred throughout the gonad, including the distal-most region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In situ hybridization for the endogenous <i>utx-1</i> transcript also showed increased expression throughout the gonad in the absence of PRC2 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, expression of the <i>putx-1</i> reporter was higher upon increased GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> activity in <i>glp-1(ar202)</i> mutants, including the distal-most region where, in the wild\u00a0type, <i>utx-1</i> is little or not expressed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Importantly, we found that the activation of the <i>utx-1</i> promoter by Notch signaling was depended on the putative LAG-1/CSL binding sites within the promoter (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yoo et al., 2004</a>), as deleting those sites reduced reporter expression by approximately one-fourth (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The interaction between LAG-1 and <i>utx-1</i> was also tested by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), performed on a strain expressing FLAG-tagged LAG-1 in either wild-type or <i>glp-1(ar202)</i> background (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>); the previously identified GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> targets, <i>lst-1</i> and <i>sygl-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kershner et al., 2014</a>), served as positive controls for the ChIP. Expectedly, we observed the enhanced binding of LAG-1 to the <i>utx-1</i> promoter, indicating that <i>utx-1</i> is a transcriptional target of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling. Summarizing, based on the observations in mutant backgrounds, PRC2 and GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling have antagonistic effects on <i>utx-1</i> transcription. However, in wild type, the endogenous levels of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling are apparently insufficient to overcome PRC2-mediated repression of <i>utx-1</i> in the distal-most part of the gonad."

Here, we report an unexpected role of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling in promoting cell fate reprograming. To understand this phenomenon, we identified genes activated upon increased GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling. While the identified genes include the physiological GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> targets, <i>sygl-1</i> and <i>lst-1</i>, many other genes, including <i>utx-1</i>, appear to be only weakly or not expressed in the distal-most region of the wild-type gonad, where both <i>sygl-1</i> and <i>lst-1</i> are induced by GLP-1<sup>Notch\u00a0</sup>(<a href=\"#bib33\">Kershner et al., 2014</a>). Thus, the wild-type levels of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling are either insufficient to induce expression of many potential target genes (see below), or their expression is controlled by additional mechanisms, perhaps similarly to <i>lip-1</i> mRNA, which, while induced by GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>, is post-transcriptionally degraded in the distal-most gonad (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hajnal and Berset, 2002</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2006</a>). In addition to its major proliferation-promoting function, GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> has been suggested to have a lesser role in promoting germ cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hansen et al., 2004</a>). Some of the identified Notch-activated genes appear to promote germ cell differentiation, potentially explaining the proposed differentiation-promoting function of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>. However, whether these genes are activated by GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and promote differentiation under physiological conditions remains to be determined."

Indeed, at least in the case of <i>utx-1</i>, PRC2 appears to prevent its inappropriate expression in the distal-most gonad, which, nevertheless, can be overcome upon increased GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling. Our findings suggest that GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> antagonizes PRC2, at least in part, by stimulating expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1, which is essential for the enhancement of cellular reprograming. Previously, it was suggested that UTX-1 influences the germline by functioning in the somatic gonad (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vandamme et al., 2012</a>). However, by using the <i>rrf-1</i> background, which displays defective RNAi in the somatic gonad, including the\u00a0DTC (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kumsta and Hansen, 2012</a>), we found that the reprograming-promoting role of UTX-1 is unlikely to depend on its function in the somatic gonad. Although we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the reprograming-facilitating role of UTX-1 depends on its expression in another somatic tissue (such as the intestine, in which RNAi remains functional in the <i>rrf-1</i> mutant; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kumsta and Hansen, 2012</a>), the germline expression of UTX-1 reported here suggests a germline-autonomous function. Consistent with this hypothesis, manipulating either PRC2 or GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> affected the germline expression of <i>utx-1</i>."

In addition to UTX-1, another H3K27/H3K9-demethylating enzyme, JMJD-1.2 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al., 2010</a>), is required for enhanced reprograming. Similar to UTX-1, JMJD-1.2 is likely to be directly involved in regulating chromatin accessibility, since its depletion results in increased levels of the repressive H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 modifications (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al., 2010</a>). The reprograming-promoting role of JMJD-1.2 might indicate that, besides further demethylation of H3K27me2, perhaps also the removal of H3K9me2 facilitates GeCo. Future studies will shed light on this interesting question."

Together with our data, these findings underscore the importance of UTX-1 in cellular reprograming. Here, we suggest that one way the activity of UTX-1 may be stimulated to promote reprograming is through its Notch signaling-dependent transcriptional activation. Interestingly, an antagonistic relationship between Notch and PRC2 has also\u00a0been observed in T-cell leukemia (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ntziachristos et al., 2012</a>). A fascinating possibility is that a regulatory principle described here could help explain the etiology of this and perhaps other human diseases linked to a pathological increase in Notch signaling."

L4 worms (strain BAT32, details in <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 3A</a>) grown on RNAi-plates were transferred to HU plates and incubated at room temperature for 5\u2009hrs prior to heat-shock in order to induce CHE-1 expression. To test HU efficiency, control animals were treated with HU for 12\u2009hrs with subsequent staining for DAPI and H3Ser10ph (pH3) antibody (Abcam #ab5176). After overnight incubation, the worms were assessed for GFP induction in the germline as described above. To assess the efficiency of the HU treatment, the <i>E. coli</i> strain MG1693 (<i>E. coli</i> stock center), with incorporated 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU), was used to feed L3/L4 worms. EdU in combination with DAPI staining was performed similar to the procedure described previously (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ito and McGhee, 1987</a>) and according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Europe) of the EdU labeling kit. The Click-iT EdU reaction buffer (Invitrogen, Europe) was mixed with Alexa Fluor azide (\u2018click\u2019 reaction) dye to detect cells that were replicating DNA.

Images subject to direct comparison were taken at identical exposure times and were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS4 in an identical manner. The numbers of analyzed gonads were as follows: n = 44 for wild-type reporter; n = 36 for <i>glp-1(gf <sup>ts</sup>)</i>; n = 55 for wild-type reporter on control RNAi; n = 48 for <i>mes-2(RNAi)</i>; n = 15 for <i>mes-3(RNAi)</i>; n = 29 for <i>mes-6(RNAi)</i>, and n = 20 for LAG-1 binding sites deleted reporter."

Here they show a requirement for Notch signalling in this process, and suggest that this role of Notch is independent of its role in promoting proliferation. They also identify targets of Notch, one of which is an H3K27 demethylase, UTX-1, suggesting a mechanism by which Notch-directed transcription may counteract PRC2-dependent repression."

In particular, the X-linked GLP-1 transcriptional targets you studied (e.g., <i>utx-1</i>) do not appear to be GLP-1 transcriptional targets in normal germline development, although they may become GLP-1 targets in the absence of PRC2. The data seem consistent with GLP-1 signaling acting within an abnormal permissive context generated by loss of PRC2. The paper should be reframed to address this point or the claim should be justified."

The <i>mes</i> genes function in the soma (Ross and Zarkower, 2003). It has also been shown that loss of gene activity in the somatic gonad can result in enhancement of the <i>glp-1(ar202</i>) tumorous germline phenotype (McGovern et al., 2009). Therefore, the authors should show that the <i>mes</i> gene mutant enhancement of <i>glp-1(ar202)</i> is germ cell autonomous, which is required based on the mechanism proposed. Similarly, the authors use RNAi of Notch upregulated genes to substantiate the argument that the genes are relevant for germ cell proliferation. While data from others has shown that some of the identified genes function in the germline (for example, Kershner et al., 2014; Doyle et al., 2000) it is also well known that loss of function of genes that function only in the soma can result in reduced proliferation (for example, Dalfo et al., 2012). Note that for <i>utx-1</i>, its function in reprogramming is interesting whether it acts in the germline or the soma, although models for its action would be different."

I think the authors do show that the balance of Glp-1 signaling and PRC2 repression are essential for normal germ cell development. I also think they've shown they can uncouple some of the Glp-1-dependent effects from proliferation phenotypes. This probably underlies the differences in absolute phenotypes between Glp-1 gof and PRC2 mutants (which are presumably maternally rescued mutants): proliferation defects in the former compared to little visible defects in the maternally rescued germ cells. It's formally interesting that raising the level of Notch activity has the same effect on transcriptional regulation as lowering PRC2 activity in these cells. It's interesting that this seems to be separate from any need for proliferation to be dysregulated.</i> "
