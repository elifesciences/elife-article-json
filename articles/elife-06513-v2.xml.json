We used multi-electrode EEG, analyzed with multitaper spectral methods and video recording of body movement to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity in 36 infants 0\u20136 months old when awake, and during maintenance of and emergence from sevoflurane general anesthesia. During maintenance: (1) slow-delta oscillations were present in all ages; (2) theta and alpha oscillations emerged around 4 months; (3) unlike adults, all infants lacked frontal alpha predominance and coherence. Alpha power was greatest during maintenance, compared to awake and emergence in infants at 4\u20136 months. During emergence, theta and alpha power decreased with decreasing sevoflurane concentration in infants at 4\u20136 months. These EEG dynamic differences are likely due to developmental factors including regional differences in synaptogenesis, glucose metabolism, and myelination across the cortex. We demonstrate the need to apply age-adjusted analytic approaches to develop neurophysiologic-based strategies for pediatric anesthetic state monitoring."

We used multi-electrode EEG, analyzed with multitaper spectral methods and video recording of body movement to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity in 36 infants 0\u20136 months old when awake, and during maintenance of and emergence from sevoflurane general anesthesia. During maintenance: (1) slow-delta oscillations were present in all ages; (2) theta and alpha oscillations emerged around 4 months; (3) unlike adults, all infants lacked frontal alpha predominance and coherence. Alpha power was greatest during maintenance, compared to awake and emergence in infants at 4\u20136 months. During emergence, theta and alpha power decreased with decreasing sevoflurane concentration in infants at 4\u20136 months. These EEG dynamic differences are likely due to developmental factors including regional differences in synaptogenesis, glucose metabolism, and myelination across the cortex. We demonstrate the need to apply age-adjusted analytic approaches to develop neurophysiologic-based strategies for pediatric anesthetic state monitoring."

Now, Cornelissen, Kim et al. have used a new EEG-based approach to demonstrate that as infants' brains develop, their responses to anesthesia change. The experiments involved 36 infants aged up to six months old who were going through routine surgical procedures. The brain activity of the infants was recorded using EEG\u2014via electrodes placed on their scalps\u2014when they were awake, during anesthesia, and as they recovered afterwards. The infants were videoed at the same time. Comparing the video with the EEG recordings allowed the brain activity of the infants to be matched up with their state of consciousness."

These findings may help scientists develop more reliable ways to monitor infants' brains during anesthesia."

Anesthetics have profound effects on all physiological systems. As a consequence, since the mid-1980s, anesthesia caregivers have been required to monitor blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation along with anesthetic gas and oxygen delivery for all patients receiving general anesthesia. The states of general anesthesia and sedation are produced by the anesthetics acting in the brain and spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brown et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ching and Brown, 2014</a>). However, brain monitoring using electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived indices is used to only a limited extent in adults, rarely in children, and essentially not at all in infants. These EEG-derived indices, which been developed in adults can give inaccurate indications of anesthetic states in infants and younger children (<a href=\"#bib20\">Davidson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Constant and Sabourdin, 2012</a>). The lack of principled strategies for monitoring the brains of infants and children receiving anesthesia care is especially troubling in view of growing concern about anesthetic toxicity to the developing brain (<a href=\"#bib42\">McCann and Soriano, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jevtovic-Todorovic et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lin et al., 2014</a>)."

Modeling studies suggest that the alpha oscillations are thalamo-cortical in origin (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vijayan et al., 2013</a>). In addition, it is now appreciated that different anesthetics have different EEG signatures that are readily visible in the unprocessed EEG and its spectrogram (<a href=\"#bib47\">Purdon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akeju et al., 2014b</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2014c</a>).

Therefore, we performed a secondary analysis to control for potential dose effects by comparing EEG spectra during MOSSA at identical end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations of 1.8% across infants. We chose 1.8% end-tidal sevoflurane because all the infants received this concentration for at least 30 s during surgery and did not exhibit body movement or reflex activity at this plane of anesthesia suggesting a behavioral state comparable to MOSSA. At 1.8% end-tidal sevoflurane, frontal group-median spectrograms at F7 show that slow and delta power was dominant over other frequencies in both age groups (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Higher frequency oscillations in the theta and alpha range were more prominent in infants 4\u20136 months of age (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013G</a>). The patterns of EEG activity observed during MOSSA were also seen during lighter planes of MOSSA at 1.8% end-tidal sevoflurane suggesting that the observed differences between the two groups are not likely due to a dose effect."

Global coherence is the fraction of variance at a given frequency across all EEG channels that is explained by the first eigenvector of the cross-spectral matrix.

Studies of propofol have shown that these alpha oscillations are strongly coherent across the front of the head during unconsciousness, whereas the slow oscillations are not coherent anywhere across the head (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lewis et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Purdon et al., 2013</a>). With return of consciousness, the frontal alpha power disappears, and posterior alpha reappears (<a href=\"#bib47\">Purdon et al., 2013</a>). Because we did not record EEG in the infants continuously and then administer sevoflurane in a gradual escalating and a gradual deescalating manner, our study could not assess anteriorization. During MOSSA, we see a small, but significant, increase in frontal alpha power when compared to occipital power in infants 4\u20136 months, which suggests this feature of anesthetic-induced consciousness emerges in early life. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that the spatio-temporal dynamics of the anesthetized states of 0- to 3-month-old and 4- to 6-month-old infants differ appreciably from each other and from those of adults."

These studies suggest that the frontal EEG alpha oscillations likely represent oscillatory activity between the cortex and thalamus (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ching et al., 2010</a>). Other modeling work suggests that anteriorization is due to different effects of propofol on thalamic nuclei that project to occipital areas compared to thalamic nuclei that project to areas of the pre-frontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vijayan et al., 2013</a>). Propofol disrupts the normal, depolarized alpha oscillations in posterior-projecting thalamic nuclei whereas it induces, hyperpolarized alpha oscillations in frontal-projecting thalamic nuclei. The differential effect appears to be due primarily to propofol's inhibition of subset of posterior-projecting neurons with hyperpolarizing activating I<sub>h</sub> currents that typically produce alpha oscillations at resting membrane voltages above 60 millivolts (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vijayan et al., 2013</a>). The slow and delta oscillations during general anesthesia are consistent with anesthetic-induced decreases in major excitatory brainstem inputs to the cortex. GABAergic anesthetic likely produce these effects by acting at the GABAergic synapses arising from inhibitory neurons in the pre-optic area of the hypothalamus that project onto each of the major arousal nuclei in the midbrain and upper pons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brown et al., 2011</a>). Both the alpha, slow and delta oscillations likely reflect disruption of thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical processing required to maintain consciousness (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ching et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Purdon et al., 2013</a>)."

Distinct regional differences in the rate of synaptogenesis, glucose metabolism, and myelination across the cortex occur between subcortical and cortical regions, and between different regions of the cortex during the first 12 postnatal months in human infants. For example, in the visual cortex, there is a rapid burst of synapse formation between 3 and 4 months, and the maximum density is reached between 8 and 12 months (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huttenlocher et al., 1982</a>). Synaptogenesis starts at the same time in the pre-frontal cortex, but the density of synapses increases much more slowly and does not peak until after the first 12 months (<a href=\"#bib30\">Johnson, 2001</a>). Additionally, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies show that between 0 and 3 months postnatal age, glucose uptake is highest in the occipital parietal, and temporal cortices; and by 6\u20138 months, glucose uptake extends to the frontal cortex appearing with higher cortical function (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chugani and Phelps, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Chugani et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kinnala et al., 1996</a>). A key role in brain development is played by the subplate neurons, the first neurons generated in the cerebral cortex, which guide formation of thalamocortical connections (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kanold and Luhmann, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kostovi\u0107 and Judas, 2010</a>). The subplate cells form the first functional connections and are a must for relaying early oscillatory activity in the developing brain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kanold and Luhmann, 2010</a>). To the extent that the alpha oscillations in the anesthetized brain are postulated to be produced by thalamocortical circuits, the appearance of the alpha oscillations at 4 months of age may suggest that an important developmental milestone has been reached in the processes guided by the subplate neurons."

As a consequence, observational studies of children receiving general anesthesia or sedation as part of routine diagnostic or therapeutic care are and will continue to be the principal approach to studying the neurophysiology of general anesthesia in children. It is crucial to plan carefully these studies and their subsequent analyses in order to maximize the information learned on this important topic. Anesthetic management was only standardized in our study to the extent that the staff at Boston Children's Hospital uses similar practices. The specific anesthetic management in each case was carried out by the attending anesthesiologist. Given the strength of the findings we report, a more systematic protocol would likely provide more evidence for our findings."

Therefore, we conducted our dose\u2013response analysis (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>), like those reported in previous studies, by observing changes in end-tidal sevoflurane concentration during emergence instead of by recording EEG while systematically changing the anesthetic dose during induction. In place of formal behavioral assessments of consciousness, which would not be feasible in children, we used movement recorded on video as an approximate behavioral marker of emergence from general anesthesia. The advantage of using body movement as a measure of emergence is that it is well-defined in children, and video recordings of body movement can be time-locked to the EEG recording for quantitative analysis. Relating onset of emergence to changes in respiration and heart rate, as well as blood pressure, also reflect effects of anesthesia but in a more complex manner being dependent on drug administration and clinical state of the patient. Similar to what we observed in adults, we found concentration- and behavior-dependent reductions in alpha and theta power during emergence in 4- to 6-month-old infants. Unlike in adults, we did not observe any relationship between slow/delta power and anesthetic concentration or behavior. The differences in slow/delta oscillation dynamics between these infants and adults may be attributable to a number of factors, including mechanistic differences the two groups, low signal-to-noise in the slow/delta band due to patient movement, and the possibility that the infants remained sedated or unconscious despite recovering movement immediately following surgery. Our comparisons between the awake state, MOSSA and emergence indicate that state-specific EEG spectral properties begin to emerge at 4\u20136 months of age. They demonstrate the challenges faced when using EEG measures to evaluate anesthetic depth in younger infants (0\u20133 months). Our findings can be strengthened by studying sevoflurane general anesthesia in children across the entire pediatric age spectrum, and by conducting similar studies of other the anesthetics, for example, propofol, dexmedetomidine, and isoflurane, commonly used in children."

These differences are likely due to differences in structural and functional aspects of cortico-cortical and thalamocortical connectivity, and help explain why EEG-based indices provide inaccurate measures of anesthetic states in children, especially during the first three months of life. We introduced the use of multitaper spectral methods in the analysis of pediatric EEG recordings to facilitate comparisons with adult analyses. We provide spectrograms to show how these brain dynamics appear on available EEG monitors."

Systems neuroscience research that takes account of brain development will be required to accurately define anesthetic states for the entire pediatric age spectrum and to devise principled neurophysiological-based strategies for anesthetic dosing in older infants (&gt;3 months) and children. Moreover, until the question of whether anesthetics are toxic to the developing brain is answered, design of neurophysiological-based definitions of anesthetic states and design of neurophysiological-based brain monitoring strategies offer the most prudent approaches to mitigating anesthetic risk in this vulnerable population."

For each infant, a 10-min EEG segment during a period of maintenance of general anesthesia adequate for surgery and where end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was maintained at a constant concentration (<span class=\"underline\">+</span>0.1%) was identified. Within this time segment, a 5-min epoch was selected from \u2018artifact-free\u2019 EEG, where motion or electrocautery artifacts were not present in the EEG. Channels with noise or artifacts were excluded from the analysis by visual inspection. EEG data analyzed during MOSSA involved epochs with median time after propofol or nitrous oxide administration of 77 min (IQR 32\u201393 min). (2) <i>Awake state to MOSSA analysis</i>: in the second part of this study, we were interested in characterizing the relationship with EEG features during the awake state, and comparing them to MOSSA. For each infant, the EEG and video recording starting before any anesthetics were administered was identified. Each video was reviewed and the sleep state of the infant identified using behavioral and vocal markers. The awake state was defined as having one of three features (1) eyes open, (2) body movement, and/or (3) crying. For each corresponding EEG segment, we extracted an 11-s \u2018artifact-free\u2019 epoch by visual inspection. If there was no \u2018artifact-free\u2019 data available then we did not include that epoch in the analysis. (3) <i>Emergence from general anesthesia analysis</i>: in the third part of this study, we were interested in characterizing relationship with EEG features, end-tidal sevoflurane concentration and onset of body movement. For each infant, an EEG segment starting from 10 min before sevoflurane gas was turned off, and finishing when end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was 0% was identified. For each EEG segment, we extracted a 30-s \u2018artifact-free\u2019 epoch by visual inspection at 10 end-tidal sevoflurane concentration ranges: (1) 0 to &lt;0.3%; (2) 0.3 to &lt;0.6%; (3) 0.6 to &lt;0.9%; (4) 0.9 to &lt;1.2%; (5) 1.2 to &lt;1.5%; (6) 1.5 to &lt;1.8%; (7) 1.8 to &lt;2.1%; (8) 2.1 to &lt;2.4%; (9) 2.4 to &lt;2.7%; and (10) 2.7 to &lt;3.0%. A 15- or 20-s epoch was used in three occasions. If there was no \u2018artifact-free\u2019 data available in a specific concentration range then we did not include that epoch in the analysis."

There is some interesting discussion about possible reasons for the differential effects of anesthesia in younger infants, older infants and adults. However, this is somewhat underplayed in the manuscript as it stands. For example, the Abstract says, \u201cthese differences in EEG dynamics are likely due to brain development\u201d, but doesn't unpack why these are interesting."

We do not know whether this was evenly distributed between the two age groups or not. Please detail. There are differences in duration and amount of anaesthetic used between age groups, but again we're not told whether this was significantly different for the two age groups.

Onset of movement relates to the anesthetic state, namely the ability of general anesthetics to suppress movement. Respiration, heart rate and blood pressure also reflect effects of anesthesia but in a more complex and derivative manner. Each of these parameters can be influenced by anesthetic state, but also can be influenced by a number of factors summarized in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Author response table 1</a> below.

All infants included in the emergence analysis required extubation. The standard anesthetic practice to extubate uses one of two ways: (1) \u201cAwake with movement\u201d, meaning with body movement, coughing, and return of some reflex activity, or (2) \u201cDeep\u201d, meaning with spontaneous breathing, but in a deeper plane of anesthesia, specifically without coughing. For &gt;90% of infant anesthetics at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, awake extubation is preferred, although anesthesiologists differ in the degree of responsiveness required prior to extubation. It is plausible that some infants may remain sedated or unconscious despite recovering movement immediately following surgery. Nevertheless, our comparisons of the EEG properties between arousal states indicate striking similarities between the awake state and emergence in infants 0 to 3 months (as well as between the awake state and MOSSA). The implications of these findings demonstrate the challenges faced when using surface EEG measures to evaluate anesthetic depth in very young infants."
