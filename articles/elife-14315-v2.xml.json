Using a combination of optogenetic stimulation and 2-photon imaging in mice, we demonstrate that selective activation of cortical excitation and inhibition elicits distinct vascular responses and identify the vasoconstrictive mechanism as Neuropeptide Y (NPY) acting on Y1 receptors. The latter implies that task-related negative Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals in the cerebral cortex under normal physiological conditions may be mainly driven by the NPY-positive inhibitory neurons. Further, the NPY-Y1 pathway may offer a potential therapeutic target in cerebrovascular disease."

Using a combination of optogenetic stimulation and 2-photon imaging in mice, we demonstrate that selective activation of cortical excitation and inhibition elicits distinct vascular responses and identify the vasoconstrictive mechanism as Neuropeptide Y (NPY) acting on Y1 receptors. The latter implies that task-related negative Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals in the cerebral cortex under normal physiological conditions may be mainly driven by the NPY-positive inhibitory neurons. Further, the NPY-Y1 pathway may offer a potential therapeutic target in cerebrovascular disease."

An earlier 'metabolic' hypothesis postulated that an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to increased neuronal activity (a.k.a. 'functional hyperemia') was directly related to energetic costs and driven by bi-products of energy consumption (CO<sub>2</sub>, lactate, H<sup>+</sup>, etc.) (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib72\">Raichle and Mintun, 2006</a>]). However, a growing body of experimental evidence, including our own, indicates that while molecules produced by increased energy metabolism do have a vasoactive effect, much of the acute CBF response in vivo under healthy conditions is driven by vasoactive messengers related to neuronal signaling (for recent reviews see [<a href=\"#bib51\">Kleinfeld et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cauli and Hamel, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Buxton et al., 2014</a>]). These messengers, released by specific cell types, actively regulate arteriolar diameters \u2013 a key control parameter in the CBF response. Thus, activation of specific types of neurons (and potentially astrocytes) as opposed to the undifferentiated spiking or synaptic activity is likely to determine the vascular response."

In Pyramidal cells (PCs), activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has been demonstrated to stimulate release of prostaglandin E2 produced by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) causing an increase in CBF (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lacroix et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Lecrux et al., 2011</a>). In inhibitory neurons (INs) \u2013 that can be further classified into subtypes based on their neurotransmitter/neuropeptide content, shape, and neurophysiological properties (<a href=\"#bib59\">Markram et al., 2004</a>) \u2013 release of neuropeptides and nitric oxide (NO) has been hypothesized to provide a bidirectional CBF control (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib16\">Cauli and Hamel, 2010</a>]). Indeed, experiments in cortical brain slices have demonstrated that stimulation of INs can cause dilation or constriction of arteriolar segments embedded in the sliced tissue with the polarity of the effect depending on the INs cell type (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cauli et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Perrenoud et al., 2012</a>).

However, direct evidence that activation of INs can cause arteriolar vasoconstriction in vivo is missing. Therefore, in the present study, we asked whether selective OG stimulation of INs can cause the biphasic dilation/constriction sequence characteristic of sensory-induced responses and whether the constriction phase was specific to activation of INs rather than excitatory neurons. Our results confirm the ability of INs to drive the biphasic arteriolar response and provide the first in vivo evidence for the major role of the NPY-Y1 pathway mediating vasoconstriction."

This was possible due to utilization of longer illumination wavelengths (see Materials and methods) and higher transparency of the mouse cortex compared to the rat; this is due to smaller diameter of the surface vessels attenuating light. The stimulus consisted of a 2-s train of electrical pulses (100 \u03bcs, 1 mA, 3\u2009Hz) delivered to the contralateral forepaw. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran was injected intravenously to visualize the vasculature. Single-vessel diameter measurements were performed at 866 locations along 120 diving arterioles and their branches (n = 320 branch measurements) in 49 wild type subjects at depths from 20 to 850\u2009\u03bcm. Consistent with our previous data, many of the measurements exhibited a biphasic arteriolar diameter change: dilation followed by constriction before returning to the baseline. To quantify the constriction amplitude, individual time-courses were temporally smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 0.5\u2009s); the peak constriction was determined as the minimum value within 3\u201313\u2009s after the stimulus onset. About half of the measurements showed constriction with the peak constriction amplitude exceeding 1% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

When measured at the same vessel location within the center of the forepaw area, the OG response featured a more pronounced constriction phase compared to the sensory one (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The overall shape of the OG response was only weakly sensitive to variation in the light pulse duration (200\u2013430 ms) and intensity (0.7\u20132.8 mW) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>). Thereafter, unless indicated, the stimulus consisted of a pair of light pulses separated by 130 ms for 450-ms total stimulus duration. These stimulus parameters produced a robust response while allowing a measurement point in between the two pulses. Averaged within a subject, 16 out of 17 OG time courses exhibited a clear constriction phase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Grouping dilation time-courses by depth revealed that the fastest dilation onset and time-to-peak occurred at the deepest measurement locations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>).

Hypothetically, however, indirect activation may be produced through disinhibition or generation of a 'rebound' action potential upon termination of the hyperpolarization (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bean, 2007</a>). This rebound mechanism is particularly relevant for deep PCs endowed with low threshold calcium conductance (<a href=\"#bib25\">de la Pe\u00f1a and Geijo-Barrientos, 1996</a>). To control for these or any other unforeseen effects of the OG stimulation on PC activity, we performed extracellular recordings of the Local Field Potential (LFP) and Multi Unit Activity (MUA) in an additional 3 VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP subjects (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). LFP in the cerebral cortex largely reflects flow of currents along the vertically aligned PCs\u2019 apical dendrites and, therefore, provides a reliable measure of PC activity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Buzs\u00e1ki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Einevoll et al., 2013</a>). Our measurements revealed no LFP response timed to the termination of the OG stimulus arguing against the presence of rebound spikes in PCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In addition, the ongoing (spontaneous) LFP activity was suppressed during the OG stimulus implying the hyperpolarization of PCs. The suppression effect was more obvious during longer OG stimuli (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

PCs and INs were identified using structural reference images (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>, see Materials and methods). During spontaneous activity, the majority of imaged PCs exhibited characteristic calcium transients known to be associated with action potentials (AP) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, left) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Grewe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Yaksi and Friedrich, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Stosiek et al., 2003</a>). In contrast, calcium transients in INs had variable kinetics and/or small amplitude (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, right). Poor quality of calcium signals in INs is consistent with previous reports and is likely to reflect low density of voltage-gated calcium channels and/or higher calcium buffering capacity in INs (<a href=\"#bib54\">Langer and Helmchen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Kerlin et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, calcium imaging in INs may not provide enough sensitivity for the detection of single (or a few) APs generated by the 5-ms OG stimulus. Indeed, the stimulus produced no detectable calcium increase (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). To ensure that this stimulus was sufficient to elicit firing, we recorded MUA activity right after acquisition of calcium imaging data. Despite the absence of a calcium increase, there was a robust MUA response to every light pulse (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). While the calcium imaging experiments failed to detect firing of INs, they provided further evidence that PCs were not activated by OG stimulation. This is because no calcium increase was detected in PCs in response to the OG stimulus, although spontaneous calcium transients were readily detectable."

In this case, we predicted that the vasoactive effect would be abolished by blocking APs and rescued by delivering the OG light stimulus directly to layer V (i.e., bypassing the need for antidromic APs as the means of communication). To test this hypothesis, we topically applied 50 \u03bcM of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a blocker of Na<sup>+</sup> channels required for generation and propagation of APs (n = 3 subjects). TTX abolished both the dilation and constriction response phase at all depths (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Next, we used a tapered optical fiber (see Materials and methods) positioned with the light-emitting tip ~600 \u03bcm below the surface (layer V).

These results also imply that, in the absence of spikes, dendritic depolarization was insufficient to induce vascular responses arguing for release of vasoactive agents from axonal terminals rather than via dendritic exocytosis. In addition, these results indicate that the density of ChR2 in axonal terminals was insufficient to drive the release directly, i.e., due to the depolarization and calcium influx resulting from opening of ChR2 in these terminals. Thus, (1) spikes were required to enable release of vasoactive agents, and (2) the communication of the surface excitation to deep release likely occurred via propagation of depolarization along dendrites rather than axons."

Therefore, first we asked whether depolarization of superficial dendrites in INs could, in principle, drive the soma, located in layer V, above its firing threshold. To address this question, we computed membrane potential in morphologically reconstructed INs. Specifically, we chose bipolar INs positive for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP). This choice was motivated by the desired orientation of the dendritic and axonal arbors in VIP-positive INs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1996</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) as well as the known vasodilatory properties of VIP (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cauli et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2014</a>)."

We computed the membrane potential at the soma in response to a step depolarization ('voltage clamp') of the upper part of their dendritic tree. All computations were carried out in the Neuron simulation environment (<a href=\"#bib42\">Hines and Carnevale, 1997</a>). We assumed passive membrane properties and clamped the voltage of the top 50-, 100- or 150-\u03bcm slab of the dendritic tree to 0 mV, which is the reversal potential of ChR2 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Nagel et al., 2003</a>). For all three conditions, we observed a strong depolarization of the soma that developed within ~50 ms. The steady state depolarization reached values between \u221240 to \u221250 mV, depending on the number of dendritic branches within the clamped region, comparable to the reported \u221243.7 mV average firing threshold for VIP-positive neurons (<a href=\"#bib62\">Neske et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In reality, dendritic membranes of INs possess active ionic conductances (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib18\">Cauli et al., 2014</a>]) enhancing the coupling of dendritic excitation to generation of spikes. Therefore, our calculation underestimates the achievable somatic depolarization. Thus, we conclude that depolarization of the upper dendrites in bipolar INs can drive spikes in somas located as deep as layer V."

The stimulus consisted of a single light pulse (330\u2013430 ms duration). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> shows the vascular responses, averaged across subjects, for each condition and the corresponding laser power. Normalized by the laser power, the peak dilation in response to the fiber was roughly twice as large as that in response to stimulation through the objective (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, inset). Thus, initiation of dilation below layer IV in response to OG light at the cortical surface could be explained by depolarization of the superficial dendrites leading to firing of the soma (situated as deep as in layer V) and release of vasoactive agents from deep axons."

Thus, neurovascular mechanism(s) governing arteriolar constriction may be specific to activation of INs rather than excitatory neurons. To test this hypothesis, we employed Thy1-ChR2-YFP (line 18) mice where expression of ChR2 is limited to layer V PCs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arenkiel, 2007</a>). Excitation of PCs can engage other cell types because glutamate released from PCs causes depolarization and firing of postsynaptic neurons. For that reason, we applied blockers of glutamatergic synaptic transmission (AP5 and CNQX, see Materials and methods) to avoid indirect activation of neuronal cell types other than PCs. Under control conditions, OG stimulation in Thy1-ChR2-YFP mice (using a single light pulse of 50\u201380 ms duration) elicited a biphasic arteriolar diameter change consisting of the initial dilation followed by constriction (n = 2 subjects, 28 measurement locations along 13 arterioles within 40\u2013380\u2009\u03bcm depth range; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, black). However, only dilation was observed in the presence of the glutamatergic blockers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, red). Thus, indirect activation of postsynaptic neurons accounted for the constriction phase. Taken together with the VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP data, these results indicate that both INs and PCs could drive dilation while constriction was selective to activation of INs."

In the present study, we used optogenetics to isolate the mechanisms originating from the inhibitory (GABAergic) population of cortical neurons. We demonstrate that OG stimulation elicited a biphasic diameter change composed of a combination of dilatory and constrictive phases. While dilation was also induced by OG stimulation of PCs, the constriction response was specific to activation of INs. Further, we identified the vasoconstrictive molecular agent as NPY acting on Y1 receptors and showed that the same NPY-Y1 pathway was responsible for the sensory stimulus-induced vasoconstriction. This finding supports previous observations in brain slices implicating NPY-positive INs as the primary mediators of vasoconstriction in cortical arterioles under normal conditions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cauli et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Perrenoud et al., 2012</a>)."

In contrast to natural behavior of cortical circuits where specific types of INs play a differential role in 'local' and 'lateral' inhibition (<a href=\"#bib41\">Helmstaedter et al., 2009</a>), OG stimulation of INs in the present study produced indiscriminate activation across various inhibitory cell types. Therefore, arteriolar responses to the OG stimulation cannot be directly compared to the results from these previous studies. However, the finding of the NPY-Y1 pathway underlying constriction predicts that NPY-positive INs may be specifically involved in shaping the surround and ipsilateral neuronal inhibition."

These results suggest that the corresponding vasoactive agents, including NPY, were released from axons rather than via dendritic exocytosis, while spikes were required to drive the release. Yet, we cannot rule out a possibility of dendritic release induced by back-propagating APs (<a href=\"#bib80\">Stuart and Sakmann, 1994</a>).

The present results, on the other hand, demonstrate a feed forward mechanism where specific vasoactive signaling agents released by active neurons drive dilation and constriction, depending on neuronal cell type. Further, the initial dilation in our experiments occurred in infragranular layers and not in layer IV, which is the most metabolic layer in SI (<a href=\"#bib78\">Sokoloff et al., 1977</a>). These findings do not contradict the fact that some of the energy metabolites are vasoactive (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gordon et al., 2008</a>).

The present results indicate that INs mediating dilation may have bipolar morphologies with dendrites extending to the surface and axons reaching to deep cortical layers.

These findings, however, do not imply that neurovascular coupling mechanisms reside exclusively in deep cortical layers and do not rule out local lamina-specific neurovascular communication at every depth. In the presence of both local and conducted signaling, the onset of dilation would be determined by the faster of the two processes. Therefore, substantial delays in the superficial arteriolar branches suggest that local neurovascular communication in the upper layers, if it exists, has slower kinetics."

In addition, the possible variation in the level of ChR2 expression could have resulted in bias towards specific INs cell types. The design of our OG study, however, did not rely on natural or balanced neuronal activity patterns. Instead, our major goal was to produce artificially selective activation of cortical INs as a single population for isolation of their vasoactive effects. Another potential pitfall is that OG stimulation of INs could lead to an indirect recruitment of PCs, which have been implicated in regulation of blood flow (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lecrux et al., 2011</a>). However, our electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging data produced no evidence for PC recruitment. Finally, the majority of the experiments in our study were performed under anesthesia and in the presence of a paralytic agent that could have affected the vasoreactivity and neurovascular coupling. As such, the ketamine/xylazine anesthesia employed by Anenberg et al. (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anenberg et al., 2015</a>) may provide an additional explanation for the discrepancy in our results regarding the constriction phase in response to OG stimulation of INs. Stepping away from anesthesia is an ongoing effort in many laboratories, including our own, but still remains a challenge for studies that require pharmacological manipulations, insertion of recording electrodes, and deep imaging. In the present study, we have confirmed the biphasic nature of the arteriolar diameter change in awake mice, both in response to a sensory stimulus and OG activation of INs."

During the PoRTS procedure, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2% initially followed by 1% during the surgery); their body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C. A custom holding bar allowing repeated head immobilization was glued to the skull overlaying the left hemisphere. On the right side, a ~3\u00a03\u2009mm area of skull was thinned until translucent and polished with silicon carbide grit powder (Convington Engineering). The exposure was centered on the Barrel cortex region of SI using stereotactic coordinates: AP \u22121.5, ML 2. A glass coverslip was glued to the thinned skull and fixed along the perimeter with dental acrylic.

Since ChR2 in the VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP line is fused with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) (<a href=\"#bib88\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>), we used EYFP fluorescence to identify INs. SR101 was used to label astrocytes (<a href=\"#bib63\">Nimmerjahn et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Next, we loaded cells with OGB1 within the same volume and performed in vivo calcium imaging in cortical layer II/III. OGB1 has a strong spectral overlap with EYFP, and, in addition, ChR2-EYFP expression in the VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP line is relatively weak. As a result, EYFP was not detectable after addition of OGB1. Therefore, we used SR101 to coregister OGB1 images with the reference (EYFP/SR101) images. EYFP-positive cells were labeled as INs, and cells negative for EYFP and SR101 were labeled as PCs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Data could not be acquired during OG stimulation because, despite the optical filtration, some of 473 nm excitation light reached the photodetectors causing their saturation. Therefore, we used brief (5 ms) light pulses and acquired line scans at 100\u2009Hz (10 ms per line) limiting the light artifact to 20\u201330 ms. In this regime, we were in a good position to detect calcium transients that have a fast rise and slow decay (time constant ~1\u2009s [<a href=\"#bib58\">L\u00fctcke et al., 2013</a>])."

We used two VIP-positive cells (ID= NMO_06142, NMO_06144) from layer II/III of the rat Barrel cortex provided by Bruno Cauli (<a href=\"#bib48\">Karagiannis et al., 2009</a>). First, the original morphologies were scaled in Z (depth axis) by 0.6 to account for differences in the cortical thickness between the rat and mouse SI. Next, we stretched the middle dendritic section from 100\u2009\u03bcm below the surface (the border between layers I and II) to the soma along the depth axis to position the soma in layer V (600\u2009\u03bcm deep) approximating morphology of a VIP-positive neuron from layer V (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). All computations were carried out in the Neuron simulation environment (<a href=\"#bib42\">Hines and Carnevale, 1997</a>) assuming passive membrane properties."

In scatter plots, measurements were group-averaged according to the depth in 100-\u03bcm bins for each subject before calculating the mean and SE across subjects for each bin. p-value for the regression parameters of the scatter data, in particular, slope values for the linear regression fits, were computed using MATLAB's statistical toolbox function <i>regstats()</i>.

For each sampled neuron, the calcium signal per time point (i.e., one line of the line-scan) was calculated as an average of all pixels within the corresponding line segment. This calculation was repeated for each line in the time series to generate a single-neuron time-course. The same procedure was performed separately for each neuron, resulting in a family of neuron-specific time-courses for each line-scan. After digital removal of the OG light artifact, data were downsampled by a factor of two along the time axis to provide a 20-ms time resolution."

The dissociation of dilation and constriction and the implication of NPY in this process are the strongest elements of the paper. Overall this is a very elegant and technically impressive study. While most studies in the field focused almost exclusively on the role of astrocytes, this group and others have recently challenged the contribution of this cell type in this process, and now provide compelling in vivo evidence for the importance of cortical neurons in neurovascular coupling. The finding that some subpopulations of cortical neurons are specialized for the control of the intracortical vasculature will have an important impact on the reliable interpretation on fMRI signals widely used to infer neuronal activity in health and disease."

For example, the first section, with its indirect ruminations about what happens when the VGAT line is driven, has many points where leaps in inference (from light density to likely firing patterns to absence of dendritic effects) make the case less compelling. The reviewers both thought that the paper would be strengthened by including unit recordings (perhaps in a preparation without simultaneous vascular recording), however both reviewers and the editors agreed that doing this well (e.g. identifying the relevant interneurons) would be challenging and that therefore this was not absolutely required for acceptance. In the event that recordings are not included care should be taken to revise the text to acknowledge this missing line of evidence."

It could of course be a multi-tiered response, in accordance with the fact that the authors likely drove interneurons throughout the depth. The authors tiptoe around this and need to just state clearly that there could (and, likely are) many lamina-specific drivers."

Any of these interpretations is fine from the perspective of the contribution of the current data, but I do want to know their take on this in print. Although a decrease in blood flow induced by OG stimulation of VGAT-ChR2 mice has not been reported per se in the Anenberg et al. 2015 study, looking closely at <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> of this paper shows a positive fractional change of the speckle contrast (i.e. blood flow decrease) in the periphery of the activated region. This is particularly evident at 4s after the onset of stimulation. Given that the 1) \"Regions of interest selected for assessment of speckle contrast over time were 1mm<sup><a href=\"#bib2\">2</a></sup> and centered at the site where the laser was targeted on the cortex\" and 2) that most of the positive fractional change of the speckle contrast does not occur in these ROI, this might explain why Anenberg and colleagues have not reported a decrease in blood flow. This should be indeed acknowledged."

In particular, they made substantial efforts by providing new data including recordings of MUA, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and GAD67 immunohistochemistry of VGAT-ChR2 mice. Although these new data do not directly show that OG stimulation activates INs and silences PCs, they provide a body of evidence supporting it (e.g. evoked spiking activity during long OG stimulation with concomitant suppression of LFP, absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in putative PCs during OG stimulation, expression of ChR2-YFP restricted to GAD67 positive cells). The new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> would benefit from insets/panels showing recordings of MUA during ongoing neuronal activity and during OG stimulation. Providing these recordings at a higher magnification and a better temporal resolution would allow better appreciation of spike shapes."

The reviewers both thought that the paper would be strengthened by including unit recordings (perhaps in a preparation without simultaneous vascular recording), however both reviewers and the editors agreed that doing this well (e.g. identifying the relevant interneurons) would be challenging and that therefore this was not absolutely required for acceptance.

OG stimulation for the duration of 200 ms resulted in a sharp and transient increase in MUA timed to the stimulus onset (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). During prolonged OG stimulation for 1s, the initial transient response was followed by a desynchronized activity, starting ~200 ms after the stimulus onset and lasting for the duration of the stimulus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Since LFP during OG stimulus was largely suppressed, we speculate that this MUA response reflects firing of INs: initially, the OG stimulus depolarizes INs causing a synchronized MUA response. Then, synaptically connected INs inhibit each other; this is why the initial MUA response is transient. During persistent OG stimulation, synaptic connectivity between different types of INs in the absence of a closed circuit loop (no participation of excitatory neurons) eventually results in desynchronized IN firing reflecting a steady state balance between the ongoing OG stimulation and mutual inhibition.

Therefore, if we could resolve individual spikes during the OG stimulus, the expectation is that their average waveform would be narrower compared to that during spontaneous activity where PCs affect the signal duration. However, identification/isolation of individual spikes and spike sorting with extracellular MUA recordings in vivo is a difficult problem. Usually, it is addressed using electrode arrays (e.g., so called \u201ctetrodes\u201d) such that a spike from a given cell can be picked up by a number of recording contacts increasing the fidelity of isolation procedure. In our experiments, we used a single-contact electrode that has sensitivity to spikes within a ~100 \u03bcm sphere around the electrode tip, containing many neurons of different types with their relative signal amplitudes depending on the size of the soma and distance from the electrode tip. In addition, cerebral circuits in vivo (at least, under anesthesia), experience up and down states with bursts of spiking activity during the up state resulting in overlapping spike waveforms. Under these conditions, isolation of individual spikes is an inherently ambiguous problem."

Furthermore, the entire image at 6s is yellow color-shifted (i.e., an increase in CBF) including the periphery. These spatially coherent fluctuations of the peripheral intensity from frame to frame suggest to us that this is not due to the measurement noise but incorrect procedure of image analysis.
