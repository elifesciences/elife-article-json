Defective KIF19A leads to hydrocephalus and female infertility because of abnormally elongated cilia. Uniquely among kinesins, KIF19A possesses the dual functions of motility along ciliary microtubules and depolymerization of microtubules. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of these functions we solved the crystal structure of its motor domain and determined its cryo-electron microscopy structure complexed with a microtubule. The features of KIF19A that enable its dual function are clustered on its microtubule-binding side. Unexpectedly, a destabilized switch II coordinates with a destabilized L8 to enable KIF19A to adjust to both straight and curved microtubule protofilaments. The basic clusters of L2 and L12 tether the microtubule. The long L2 with a characteristic acidic-hydrophobic-basic sequence effectively stabilizes the curved conformation of microtubule ends. Hence, KIF19A utilizes multiple strategies to accomplish the dual functions of motility and microtubule depolymerization by ATP hydrolysis."

Defective KIF19A leads to hydrocephalus and female infertility because of abnormally elongated cilia. Uniquely among kinesins, KIF19A possesses the dual functions of motility along ciliary microtubules and depolymerization of microtubules. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of these functions we solved the crystal structure of its motor domain and determined its cryo-electron microscopy structure complexed with a microtubule. The features of KIF19A that enable its dual function are clustered on its microtubule-binding side. Unexpectedly, a destabilized switch II coordinates with a destabilized L8 to enable KIF19A to adjust to both straight and curved microtubule protofilaments. The basic clusters of L2 and L12 tether the microtubule. The long L2 with a characteristic acidic-hydrophobic-basic sequence effectively stabilizes the curved conformation of microtubule ends. Hence, KIF19A utilizes multiple strategies to accomplish the dual functions of motility and microtubule depolymerization by ATP hydrolysis."

One of these microtubule-based motors, referred to as KIF19A, accumulates at the tip of cilia and controls their length. It does so by combining two actions: it moves along the microtubule to the tip of the cilium, and then removes tubulin molecules from the end. Microtubules are straight along their length and curved at the end, and it is thought that kinesin recognizes both of these shapes in order to carry out these roles. A single region of the KIF19A protein appears to be able to accomplish both roles, but the molecular changes that the protein undergoes to do so are not known."

The findings show that KIF19A uses multiple strategies to enable it to carry out its roles. To understand better how KIF19A depolymerizes the microtubule, a more detailed structure of KIF19A together with tubulin will be needed. Structural studies of KIF19A in cilia will also be useful to understand how the protein controls the length of microtubules."

Most KIFs, including kinesin-1\u2013kinesin-12 and kinesin-14 subfamily members, actively move along the MT toward either the plus or minus end to transport cellular cargoes, such as protein complexes, vesicles and mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hirokawa et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, kinesin-13 proteins, such as KIF2A and KIF2C, are not actively motile along MTs but depolymerize MTs from both ends to control MT dynamics (<a href=\"#bib7\">Desai et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Homma et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ogawa et al., 2004</a>). Kinesin-13 proteins reach the ends of MTs by a passive one-dimensional random diffusion (<a href=\"#bib12\">Helenius et al., 2006</a>) or with the assistance of a MT plus end-tracking protein (<a href=\"#bib17\">Honnappa et al., 2009</a>).

The most extensively studied kinesin-8, Kip3p (budding yeast kinesin-8; a homologue of mammalian KIF18), requires its C-terminal tail for MT-binding to prevent its detachment from the MT lattice (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mayr et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Stumpff et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Su et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Weaver et al., 2011</a>). Kip3p is highly processive (&gt;5\u2009\u03bcm) and multiple Kip3ps act cooperatively to mediate length-dependent MT depolymerization. One possible model for a length-dependent action is proposed to involve the incoming Kip3p bumping off the paused motor at the MT plus-end (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gupta et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Varga et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2009</a>).

We also reported that, unlike KIF18A, a KIF19A dimer without the tail domain depolymerizes MTs mainly from the plus-end. Therefore, KIF19A possesses the key structural elements for the dual functions of the catalytic motor domain. Thus, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the dual KIF19A functions, we performed crystal structure analysis of the mouse KIF19A motor domain as well as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of the KIF19A motor domain complexed with a MT. In combination with a structure-based mutagenesis analysis, the functional anatomy of KIF19A is reported. In the catalytic core of KIF19A, the KIF19A-specific feature of adopting two different interfaces for MTs and tubulins is utilized to achieve the dual functions."

To clarify which region is responsible for these dual functions, we made the monomeric construct KIF19A-353 (353WT) and assessed its motility and MT-depolymerizing activities. 353WT includes the motor domain followed by the neck-linker, but does not include the neck coiled coil, which is required for the dimerization of KIF19A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We first performed the <i>in vitro</i> MT gliding assay, in which tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled and polarity-marked MTs were used to show the tracking direction. The strongly-labeled MT minus-ends lead the MT gliding, suggesting that the monomeric 353WT moves toward the plus-end (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). MT gliding velocity was 5.3 \u00b1 1.2 nm/s (n\u00a0=\u00a0105 MTs from three independent preparations, mean \u00b1 SD, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>), which was slower than that of dimeric KIF19A-379 (21 \u00b1 3 nm/s) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Niwa et al., 2012</a>). An <i>in vitro</i> MT depolymerizing assay was also performed for KIF19A-353 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Desai et al., 1999</a>). GMPCPP-MTs were dose-dependently depolymerized by 353WT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The half-maximal effective concentration for MT depolymerization (EC<sub>50</sub>) was 142 \u00b1 2 nM, which was approximately half that of KIF19A-379 (253 nM) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Considering that one of two motor domains will reach the plus-end of the MT, EC<sub>50</sub> values of one catalytic unit for depolymerizing MTs might be similar between monomeric 353WT and dimeric KIF19A-379. Either way, these <i>in vitro</i> experiments collectively indicate that the KIF19A monomer construct, 353WT, is a dual function motor that moves along and depolymerizes MTs."

At the initial stage of the 353WT structure determination process, the residues of the switch II helix \u03b14 could not be determined because there was no corresponding density at the site where \u03b14 is usually located at the center of the MT-binding interface (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Instead, we found an unmodeled helical-like density, which was more distant from the KIF19A catalytic core (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Long wavelength X-ray diffraction experiment was thus performed to investigate the property of this density (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hendrickson and Teeter, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Dauter et al., 1999</a>), because\u00a0in the switch II helix \u03b14, one cysteine residue exists. It\u00a0successfully depicted the anomalous diffractions of sulfur or phosphorus atoms (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E</a>). Among them, one strong anomalous signal was detected close to the center of the corresponding helical density (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). When the Cys283 residue was assigned to this anomalous signal, all the residues in \u03b14 and the following loop L12 were reasonably determined (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). In this way, the complete tertiary structure of 353WT was finally determined with a reasonable decrease of the R-factor to 22.2% (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

                                "text": "The overall structure of the KIF19A 353WT motor domain shared a similar triangle-shape with other kinesins, which consists of a central \u03b2-sheet of eight strands, sandwiched between six \u03b1-helices, three on either side (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sack et al., 1999</a>). In the 353WT atomic structure, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP was found embedded in the nucleotide-binding pocket. In comparison with previously solved motor domains of various KIFs, the remarkable features of the KIF19A motor domain are concentrated on its MT-binding side and include the long and wide L2 loop, the flexible L8 loop, the disordered \u03b14 helix, and the short \u03b16 helix (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>). Loop L2 is located at the minus-end side (rear side) of the MT-binding surface and is atypically long. Loop L8, which is the major MT-binding region at the plus-end side, is more retracted toward the catalytic core compared with that of kinesin-13 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The switch II helix \u03b14, which is considered the main contributor to MT-based kinesin motility, is more distant from the motor domain than those of other kinesins including kinesin-8 KIF18A (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and D</a>). In comparison to the other kinesins, the first portion of helix \u03b15 is more destabilized in KIF19A (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>); therefore, the loop region between \u03b14 and \u03b15 (L12) is longer. This might allow the invasion of a neighboring molecule into the space between \u03b14 and the motor domain in the crystal packing environment, resulting in the distant position of \u03b14 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). Helix \u03b16 serves as a base for the neck-linker element, which is important for both the regulation of ATPase activity and MT-based kinesin motility (<a href=\"#bib4\">Case et al., 2000</a>). Its reduced length by more than one turn might be caused by the atypical glycine mutation in helix \u03b16, which is not seen in other typical plus end motors (G341, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Glycine has high conformational flexibility and often tends to disrupt the \u03b1-helix, which might affect the conformation of the following neck-linker by terminating \u03b16 prematurely."

L2 of kinesin-13 is a key element contributing to MT depolymerization (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ogawa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Shipley et al., 2004</a>). According to sequence alignments, KIF2C and KIF19A have L2 regions (\u03b21b-L2-\u03b21c) of comparable length in which the hydrophobic residue(s) around the tip is/are suggested to be surrounded by basic and acidic residue(s) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). KIF2C has a slender L2 with a KVD finger at its tip that is vital to MT depolymerization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ogawa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Shipley et al., 2004</a>). In contrast, KIF19A has a long, fan-shaped L2 that has a hydrophobic tip (I54-L55) sandwiched between acidic and basic clusters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Despite the acidic-hydrophobic-basic order being conserved between KIF2C and KIF19A, their shapes are distinct from each other. To test the contribution of these residues to MT-depolymerizing activity, we introduced a series of mutations: an alanine mutant of the basic cluster (PC2A: R56A-H58A-R59A-R61A) and hydrophobic mutants (I54A, L55A, and IL2A: I54A-L55A). It should be noted that the alanine mutant of the acidic cluster was so unstable that we were unable to acquire reliable <i>in vitro</i> data. The acidic cluster is, however, expected to contribute to the depolymerization function."

PC2A,\u00a0L55A and IL2A markedly impaired depolymerization, while I54A had little effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Different concentrations of 353WT and the L2 mutants that showed an effect (PC2A and L55A) were then incubated with GMPCPP-stabilized MTs to obtain EC<sub>50</sub> values for MT depolymerization.

The dose-reaction curve of L55A was shifted to the right of 353WT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). For PC2A, even at the highest enzyme concentration used (5000 nM), approximately 50% of the wild-type depolymerization activity was achieved. We also observed MT depolymerization in the presence of 5\u2009mM Mg-ATP by TIRF microscopy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The depolymerization was mainly observed at the MT plus-ends and the speeds were 10.9 \u00b1 2.0 nm/s for 353WT, 2.5 \u00b1 0.5 nm/s for L55A, and 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 nm/s for PC2A.

Consistent with a previous report, the KIF18A monomer had little MT depolymerization activity (<a href=\"#bib47\">Weaver et al., 2011</a>). The substitution of KIF19A L2 mildly increased the depolymerization activity of KIF18A. Note that a fraction of KIF18A moved to the soluble fraction via interaction with depolymerized tubulin-dimers. In contrast, the L2 of KIF19A did not make KIF5C a MT depolymerase. These data collectively suggested that the basic cluster of L2, as well as the Leu 55 at the tip of L2, play crucial roles in depolymerization from MT ends, although the simple swapping of L2 is not sufficient for transport motors such as KIF5C to attain MT depolymerization function."

Therefore, it is expected that KIF19A ATPase will be activated by both MTs and tubulins. To confirm this idea, we first examined the steady-state ATPase activity of the wild-type construct in the absence/presence of MTs or tubulins. The basal ATPase activities of 353WT, L55A, and PC2A in the absence of MTs or tubulins were all comparable to that of another kinesin-8 motor, Kip3p (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gupta et al., 2006</a>). Activation of 353WT by MTs caused the ATPase to be activated ~300 times to reach a maximum rate of 1.43 \u00b1 0.07\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup>, while free tubulin-dimers caused the ATPase to be activated ~200 times to reach a maximum rate of 0.80 \u00b1 0.06\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, the KIF19A ATPase is similarly activated by both MTs and tubulins. This characteristic is conserved among kinesin-8 proteins, including KIF18A (<a href=\"#bib34\">Peters et al., 2010</a>). However, the ratio of KIF19A ATPase activation by tubulins/MTs is much higher than that of KIF18A, suggesting that KIF19A is more adapted to tubulins to increase MT depolymerization activity."

The affinities for MTs and tubulins were slightly affected by the L55A mutation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and 4B</a>). This indicates that the role of L55 in MT depolymerization is independent from that of the KIF19A catalytic cycle stimulated by MTs or tubulins. This L55 property seems similar to that of the valine residue of the KVD finger in kinesin-13 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ogawa et al., 2004</a>). In contrast, PC2A significantly decreased the MT/tubulin stimulation of the KIF19A ATPase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The PC2A mutation did not significantly affect the <i>K</i><sub>M, tubulin</sub>, but markedly increased the <i>K</i><sub>M, MT</sub> to approximately 30 times that of 353WT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that the basic residues in L2 might strengthen the MT-lattice binding at the weak-binding state, similar to the K-loop of KIF1A (<a href=\"#bib32\">Okada and Hirokawa, 2000</a>). The PC2A mutation also decreased the ATPase stimulation by tubulin without affecting the <i>K</i><sub>M, tubulin</sub>. Hence, the KIF19A-specific basic residues of L2 might be involved in the tubulin-activated ATPase pathway, as described later."

This was confirmed by a MT co-sedimentation assay using KIF19A and a non-hydrolysable ATP-analogue, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). We found that L55A slightly decreased MT affinity (353WT, <i>K</i><sub>d, MT</sub> 0.6 \u00b1 0.1\u2009\u03bcM; L55A, <i>K</i><sub>d, MT</sub> 1.6 \u00b1 0.3\u2009\u03bcM), whereas PC2A severely decreased MT affinity (PC2A, <i>K</i><sub>d,MT</sub> 5.8 \u00b1 2.1\u2009\u03bcM), consistent with the kinetics data above (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We also observed the MT gliding motility of KIF19A. The speed of the L55A mutant was a little higher than that of 353WT described above (L55A, 7.5 \u00b1 0.6 nm/s, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a>). However, bound MTs were rarely detected when the PC2A mutant, at the same concentration as L55A, was fixed on the coverslip. We thus checked the number of bound MTs to PC2A in the presence of AMP-PNP. Different concentrations of MTs were incubated with 353WT or PC2A in the presence of 5\u2009mM AMP-PNP. Although PC2A bound fewer MTs than 353WT, increasing the concentration of PC2A (1 mg/ml) enabled sufficient microtubules to fix to the glass surface (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Even in these conditions, however, bound MTs glided distances that were too short to reliably calculate the gliding speed on the PC2A-coated coverslip. Thus, the PC2A mutation severely increased the dissociation constant for MTs so that few MTs were observed on PC2A attached to the coverslip. The KIF18A and KIF5C L2 substitution mutations were also introduced into KIF19A to check MT gliding motilities. Again, bound MTs were not detectable with KIF5C L2 and very few MTs were detected with KIF18A L2, indicating that the L2 of KIF19A, especially its basic cluster, is necessary for 353WT to stay attached to MTs."

The L2 of KIF19A was swapped into the kinesin-8 member, KIF18A, and the kinesin-1 member, KIF5C, to clarify its effect on motility. As a consequence, MTs glided much more slowly with the swap mutants compared with the wild-type motors (KIF18A WT, 34.4 \u00b1 0.3 nm/s; KIF18A swap, 10.2 \u00b1 0.1 nm/s; KIF5C WT, 179.9 \u00b1 2.5 nm/s; KIF5C swap, 68.9 \u00b1 0.2 nm/s) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013H</a>). The intensive ionic interactions between the L2 of KIF19A and MTs might reduce motility speed. KIF19A L2 is thus likely to interact electrostatically with the MT to tether the KIF19A motor domain on the MT, which in turn reduces motility speed on the MT."

Thus we first constructed two KIF19A swap mutants, in which L12 was replaced with the counterpart of KIF18A or KIF5C (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In comparison to 353WT, soluble tubulin was decreased in the presence of KIF5C L12, but was slightly increased in the presence of KIF18A L12 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Within the KIF18A L12 sequence, three continuous basic residues (K299, R300 and R301) are present. Only one basic residue, K274, was found in the L12 of KIF5C, whereas two basic residues, K290 and K294, were found in the L12 of KIF19A. Therefore, to test the relationship between the number of basic residues in L12 and MT depolymerization ability, we made two more constructs: GS2R, in which both G291 and S292 were mutated to arginine, such that L12 had four basic residues, and K2A in which both K290 and K294 were replaced with alanine, such that L12 had no basic residues. As expected, GS2R exhibited a slight increase in MT depolymerization activity, similar to the KIF18A L2 swap mutant, whereas K2A without basic residues in L12 showed lower MT depolymerization ability, similar to the KIF5C L2 swap mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013G</a>)."

In contrast, K2A showed a lower MT- and tubulin-activated turnover rate and a higher Michaelis-Menten constant for both MTs and tubulins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Therefore, the change in the number of basic residues in L12 might alter the electrostatic affinities to the MT lattice or tubulins. To further confirm this idea, a MT co-sedimentation assay with Taxol-stabilized MTs was performed. The GS2R mutation did not significantly alter the affinity for MTs (353WT, <i>K</i><sub>d, MT</sub> 0.6 \u00b1 0.1\u2009\u03bcM; GS2R, <i>K</i><sub>d, MT</sub> 0.6 \u00b1 0.06\u2009\u03bcM). The K2A mutation, however, significantly weakened the affinity for MTs (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> 3.0 \u00b1 0.6\u2009\u03bcM) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). Thus, two basic residues of L12 contribute to the depolymerization ability of KIF19A through electrostatic interaction. Further addition of basic residues did not effectively increase MT affinity."

Thus, the binding partner of KIF19A L12 was expected to be the E-hook, the C-terminal tail of tubulin that has an acidic cluster. To address whether the E-hook is responsible for the electrostatic interaction with the KIF19A motor domain, we incubated KIF19A with two kinds of MTs, normal tubulin polymers and tubulin-S polymers, in the presence of AMP-PNP. Tubulin-S, which was obtained by limited subtilisin proteolysis of tubulin dimer, lacks the cluster of negatively charged residues found in the E-hook of \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulins. Whether the binding ratio was 1:1 or 1:2.5, a greatly reduced quantity of KIF19A was seen in the tubulin S assembled MT pellet (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>). Thus, the E-hook of tubulin is confirmed to be responsible for the KIF19A-MT interaction."

At this position, a proline residue is highly conserved among kinesin superfamily proteins except for KIF19A (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). It has been proposed that this proline serves as a 'helix starter' of \u03b15 because of its restricted dihedral angles. Thus, a lack of proline at the starting position of \u03b15 might destabilize helix \u03b15, further destabilizing the preceding L12 and \u03b14, as is observed in the crystal structure of 353WT in the absence of a MT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>). To test this hypothesis, Asn297 was mutated to proline to clarify its effect on depolymerization and motility along MTs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013G</a>). The resulting EC<sub>50</sub> value of N297P for MT depolymerization (EC<sub>50</sub> 201 \u00b1 2\u2009\u03bcM, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) was slightly increased compared to the wild type, with the slight decrease in the depolymerization speed (7.7 \u00b1 1.3 nm/s, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D and E</a>). In contrast, the MT-gliding velocity (6.5 \u00b1 0.2 nm/s) was slightly increased compared to the wild type in three independent experiments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F and G</a>). Therefore, Asn297 in \u03b15 has a slight advantage for the MT depolymerization but has a slight disadvantage for the motility over Pro297."

This movement is accompanied by approximately\u00a07 degree counter-clockwise rotation of the following helix \u03b13, as also reported in kinesin-13 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ogawa et al., 2004</a>).

The length, the location, and the angle of \u03b14 in KIF5-free fit perfectly to the corresponding cryo-EM density of KIF19A-free (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). This means that KIF19A is able to adjust the switch II conformation to fit the straight tubulin interface on the MT-lattice. It is also notable that a clear density was found at the right side of \u03b14, corresponding to the E-hook of \u03b2-tubulin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E and F</a>).

No marked difference was observed between KIF19A-ADP and KIF19A-free on a MT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). The corresponding density of L2 almost reaches the inter-tubulin-dimer groove close to the H11\u2019-helix of \u03b2-tubulin at the minus-end side (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I</a>). Because L2 has the characteristic sequence in which the hydrophobic residues at the tip of L2 are sandwiched by an acidic cluster on the left side and a basic cluster on the right side, the possible interactions of these residues were estimated from the fitted atomic models of KIF19A and tubulin-dimers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>). The acidic cluster faces the H11\u2019 helix of the neighboring \u03b2-tubulin, where basic H406 and K402 residues are located (red region in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>). However, the C\u03b1 distance between L2 and H11\u2019 is around 11\u2009\u00c5, which is slightly longer than a stable interacting distance. Hydrophobic residues presumably interact with the hydrophobic residues of the H8-S7 loop and the H12 helix in \u03b1-tubulin (yellow region in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>). Consistent with the mutational studies, the L55 of L2 serves as the main interface of the hydrophobic contacts. The basic cluster then faces acidic clusters on the H12 helix of \u03b1-tubulin (blue region in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>). Its C\u03b1 distances are within 9\u2009\u00c5, thus salt-bridges might be formed between them even on the straight MT lattice. When KIF19A is on the MT-lattice, therefore, loop L2 interacts with \u03b1-tubulin through the hydrophobic tip and basic cluster, though the acidic cluster will not contribute to the interaction with the MT."

To accomplish these requirements, KIF19A-specific characteristics are concentrated on the MT-binding surface. As detailed in the following sections, for the 1st requirement, the location of the destabilized, retractable loop L8 and switch II (\u03b14-L12-\u03b15) enable adjustment to both the straight tubulin interface on the MT-lattice [<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C(i)</a>] and the curved tubulin interface at the MT-ends [<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C(iv)</a>]. For the second requirement, the long and fan-shaped L2 is located at the minus-end side. It plays a central role in depolymerizing MTs from the ends through stabilization of the curved conformation of MT-ends. Helix \u03b16 is atypically shorter than those of the other previously solved kinesins. Its functional meaning is still uncertain mainly because structural information for the neck-linker that follows \u03b16 is still lacking. The short conformation of \u03b16 is expected to affect the neck-linker conformation and further structural study of KIF19A in the ATP state is needed to address the role of the short helix \u03b16."

At that point, the highly conserved proline residue is replaced in KIF19A with a unique asparagine residue (Asn297). A proline residue is often found at the start or end points of a helix to stabilize it. Thus, replacement of proline for an asparagine residue might destabilize \u03b15 allowing it to melt into the flexible long L12 loop. In fact, the first turn of helix \u03b15 melted in the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Therefore, we expected that the flexible feature of the L12 and initial \u03b15 might be caused by the KIF19A-specific Asn297. This idea was supported by our biochemical experiment. The N297P mutant had a more than 40% decrease in tubulin-stimulated ATPase activity compared with the wild type, indicating that this mutation limits adjustment of the KIF19A interface to the curved tubulin-dimer (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Thus, the destabilized conformation of switch II is the second key feature to avoid collision when binding to the curved MT end [<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C(iv)</a>].

It should be noted here that the PC2A mutation only decreases the affinity for MTs but not for soluble tubulin-dimers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). As described below, the additional salt bridges through the acidic cluster on the left side of L2 are only formed when interacting with a tubulin-dimer. This could possibly minimize the effect of the PC2A mutation on the affinity for tubulins, but not on the affinity for MTs. In contrast, when the basic cluster was introduced into the L2 of KIF5C or KIF18A, the motility speed decreased to nearly one third of wild type. The additional strong interaction between the basic cluster and MTs might slow down the detachment of KIF19A from the MT.

Our data showed that more than two of the basic residues in L12 were required to show wild-type KIF19A MT-binding ability and MT-depolymerization activity. In kinesin-13, alanine substitutions of charged residues in the switch II cluster showed lower depolymerization activity due to weak MT binding ability (<a href=\"#bib38\">Shipley et al., 2004</a>).

Alanine mutation of Leu 55, which caused a MT depolymerization deficiency with a small effect on MT-based motility, suggested its central role for depolymerizing MTs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The comparison of KIF19A binding to the MT-lattice and the MT-curved end indicates a further role for L2 [<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C(i) and (iv)</a>]. The interactions between L2 of KIF19A and \u03b1-tubulin through the hydrophobic tip of L2 and the basic cluster of L2 are similarly observed for both straight and curved tubulins. For curved tubulins, however, interactions between L2 and the neighboring \u03b2-tubulin at the minus-end side would also be formed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). The H11\u2019 helix of \u03b2-tubulin gets closer to L2 by ~2\u00c5 compared with that in the straight conformation (C\u03b1 distance is around 9\u2009\u00c5) so that the acidic cluster could make salt bridges with the basic residues in the H11\u2019 helix of \u03b2-tubulin. Therefore, the combination of acidic-hydrophobic-basic residues of L2 stabilizes the curved conformation of inter-tubulin-dimer interface. This could be the structural basis for MT depolymerization by KIF19A."

The destabilized switch II helices contribute to the adaptation to the two distinct interfaces of straight and curved MTs with a concomitant sacrifice of slightly decreased motility speed along the MT. The rotatable L8-\u03b13-L9 cluster also supports adaptation to the two interfaces. The basic cluster of L2, as well as the basic residues of L12, enable KIF19A to tether to both straight and curved MTs via flexible ionic interactions with the acidic residues of H12 or the E-hook of tubulins. This assures its motility along the MT, although motility speed may be decreased. The hydrophobic tip of L2, as well as the surrounding basic and acidic clusters, play critical roles in MT depolymerization. These residues stabilize the inter-tubulin-dimer interface of the curved MT protofilament. Thus, the curved conformation of MT ends is stabilized by L2, resulting in the depolymerization of the MTs. In this way, KIF19A has acquired dual functions by introducing multiple strategies. The resulting KIF19A is a slow plus-end directed motor combined with mild MT-depolymerizing activity. The KIF19A motility speed and the MT depolymerization activity might be different on ciliary doublet MTs. Further studies are required to reveal how KIF19A is involved in length control of ciliary MTs <i>in vivo</i>."

Motion corrected and summed images were analyzed for defocus and astigmatism using CTFFIND3 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003</a>) and images without significant drift and astigmatism were used for further analysis. To generate an initial low-resolution model (~20\u2009\u00c5), images of a 14-protofilament motor-microtubule complex were selected and semi-automatically straightened using the 'unbend' program of Ruby-Helix (<a href=\"#bib23\">Metlagel et al., 2007</a>). Three-dimensional structures were generated using asymmetric helical reconstruction (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kikkawa, 2004</a>). This initial 3D structure was then used for single particle analysis as described previously (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shang et al., 2014</a>). Segments were extracted at a spacing of 80\u2009\u00c5 using a box size of 768\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0768 pixels and initial XY shifts and Euler angles were determined by template matching to the 3D model. The position of the microtubule seam was determined using the set of segment images extracted from one microtubule as described (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</a>). Subsequently, the parameters were refined and the 3D structures were reconstructed using the FREALIGN package (<a href=\"#bib10\">Grigorieff, 2007</a>) without imposing symmetry. The helical parameters were determined from the non-symmetrized map and the parameters were applied to the map. Twelve rounds of refinement with increasing resolution were performed. To assess the effective resolutions and possible over-fitting, the phases of high-resolution components (&gt;10\u2009\u00c5) of individual images were randomized (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2013</a>) and the 3D structures were reconstructed and analyzed by Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC; <a href=\"#bib44\">Van Heel, 1987</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Kinesins-8 combine the ability to move along microtubules with the ability to depolymerise the GTP caps of microtubules. Kif19A is a kinesin-8 that has been shown by the authors to be required for ciliary microtubule length-control. The structures reported here reveal novel features of the tubulin / microtubule binding surface of Kif19A. Wang et al. hypothesize that the various features of this surface allow Kif19A to bind to both 'straight' tubulin in microtubules and 'curved' tubulin in solution and at the depolymerising plus ends of dynamic microtubules. They test the roles of the various features of this interface by mutagenesis of KIF19A and by transplant experiments where these features are moved to related kinesins. The properties of these mutants are explored using depolymerisation assays done with GMPCPP microtubules, and in ATPase assays using both microtubules and tubulin. The depolymerisation mechanism(s) of kinesin-8 are poorly understood at the protein-chemistry level and KIF19A is particularly important, given its role in ciliogenesis. There is a previous structural study of a different kinesin-8 Kif18a, which reported some of the unusual features described here, but there is sufficient novel information that advances our understanding of the kinesin-8 mechanism."

In the new figures, the atomic model of nucleotide-free KIF19A on a MT, produced using the rigid body fitted model of KIF19A-ADP and KIF5-free, is presented (in the second paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). This has enabled us to more clearly present the conformational changes from the KIF19A-ADP without MT to the KIF19A-free on an MT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In the Discussion section, in silico fitting of the KIF19A structures with a curved tubulin-dimer is described to clarify which regions are responsible for the dual functions of KIF19A (subsection \u201cL8 and switch II of KIF19A requires flexibility to fit the tubulin interfaces in both the MT-lattice and MT-curved end\u201d, first paragraph). This clearly illustrates that the KIF19A-specific conformations of the long L2, the retractable L8, and the disordered switch II, play central roles in its dual functions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C\u2013E</a>)."

Although fewer MTs were observed compared with the WT motor, an increased concentration of PC2A (1 mg/ml) enabled sufficient microtubules to be bound (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Even in these conditions, however, MTs were bound to the coverslip for too short a time to reliably calculate the gliding speed on the PC2A-coated coverslip. Thus, the PC2A mutation severely increased the dissociation constant for MTs so that few MTs were observed on PC2A attached to the coverslip. We have added this discussion in the first paragraph of the subsection \u201cLoop L2 Tethers KIF19A to MTs and Might Slow Down Motility\u201d."
