Traditionally, it has been regarded as a passive process in which the doomed cell is simply destroyed by the catalytic activity of the caspases. However, in recent years, it has become clear that dying cells interact with their healthy neighbours. In addition to sending the \u2018find-me, eat-me signals\u2019 that lead to their own elimination, they can also send signals that cause other cells to proliferate (<a href=\"#bib6\">P\u00e9rez-Garijo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ryoo et al., 2004</a>). Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Ainhoa P\u00e9rez-Garijo, Yaron Fuchs and Hermann Steller at the Rockefeller University reveal another remarkable property of apoptotic cells: namely that they can induce apoptosis from afar in cells that were not subjected to the initial apoptotic stimulus (<a href=\"#bib5\">P\u00e9rez-Garijo et al., 2013</a>)."

This structure, which gives rise to the wings of the adult, is subdivided into two distinct lineage blocks, the anterior and the posterior compartment. The sophisticated methods of gene manipulation that are possible in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Potter et al., 2010</a>) allow an experimental analysis of apoptosis that cannot be performed in other organisms. Moreover, apoptotic cells can be kept alive indefinitely through the expression of a protein from baculoviruses called P35, which blocks the activity of the executioner caspases (<a href=\"#bib3\">Hay et al., 1994</a>). These \u2018undead\u2019 cells have been used to reveal properties of apoptotic cells that are difficult to discern in normal apoptotic cells, which are short-lived (<a href=\"#bib6\">P\u00e9rez-Garijo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ryoo et al., 2004</a>). Another convenient feature of the wing disc is that no apoptosis occurs during normal development: this means that any apoptosis that is observed must be due to experimental intervention."

Unexpectedly, however, they also saw substantial apoptosis in the anterior compartment; that is, apoptosis propagated across the antero\u2013posterior compartment boundary to cells in which the <i>hid</i> gene had not been activated. This phenomenon\u2014which P\u00e9rez-Garijo et al. have named AiA, short for apoptosis-induced apoptosis\u2014is not an artefact related to the use of undead cells, because the same phenomenon also occurred in cells not protected by P35. Moreover, apoptosis-induced apoptosis was seen in other imaginal discs but not, intriguingly, in the eye-antenna disc."

The presence of Hid or Reaper in the posterior cells triggers the apoptotic loop: it degrades the anti-apoptotic protein Diap1, thus allowing activation of the caspase Dronc. This has two consequences: it activates the caspase Drice, which is responsible for actually killing the cell, and it upregulates the JNK pathway, which amplifies the activity of the genes that code for Hid and Reaper. The posterior cells produce a ligand called Eiger (Egr), which diffuses across the anterior\u2013posterior border and activates the JNK pathway in anterior cells, triggering apoptosis. It is thought that the Eiger signal is produced by the JNK pathway itself, but the evidence is not conclusive (hence the question mark). (<b>B</b>) Schematic representation of AiA. The cells at the focal point of the initial apoptotic event emit death signals: Egr in flies or TNF-\u03b1 in mammals. These signals diffuse away and induce secondary apoptosis in cells located at a distance from the primary focus.

P\u00e9rez-Garijo et al. went on to show that Eiger is produced in the posterior compartment and then travels to the anterior compartment, where it induces JNK signalling and subsequently activates the apoptotic loop (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

One could speculate that it is also implicated in the production of the Eiger signal, and hence apoptosis at a distance: the fact that increasing the level of JNK signalling in the posterior compartment also increases AiA in the anterior compartment supports this view (Figure 6 in <a href=\"#bib5\">P\u00e9rez-Garijo et al., 2013</a>)."

The production of new hairs involves a cycle of growth, coordinated cell death (known as the catagen phase) and rest, and TNF-\u03b1 signalling has been implicated in this cycle. P\u00e9rez-Garijo et al. confirmed that it is the apoptotic cells that produce TNF-\u03b1 during the catagen phase, and that inhibiting TNF-\u03b1 dramatically reduces apoptosis and disrupts hair follicle functioning. This is fully consistent with involvement of AiA during the mouse hair follicle cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Processes such as the removal of the tadpole tail in amphibians or the interdigital webbing of many vertebrates are associated with collective apoptosis that may be coordinated by AiA. It may also underlie some human pathologies associated with massive apoptosis, such as cardiac infarction, cirrhosis or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In cancer therapy, AiA might have a role in the \u2018bystander effect\u2019\u2019\u2014the observation that cells that have not been exposed to radiation sometimes respond in the same way as nearby cells that have been exposed to radiation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Prise and O\u2019Sullivan, 2009</a>). It is possible that in these cases, the initial apoptotic stimulus triggers a death epidemic in which Eiger or TNF-\u03b1 act as the propagating vectors."
