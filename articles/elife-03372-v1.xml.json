The dynein regulator Lis1 is known to keep dynein bound to microtubules; however, how this is accomplished mechanistically remains unknown. We have used three-dimensional electron microscopy, single-molecule imaging, biochemistry, and in vivo assays to help establish this mechanism. The three-dimensional structure of the dynein\u2013Lis1 complex shows that binding of Lis1 to dynein's AAA+ ring sterically prevents dynein's main mechanical element, the \u2018linker\u2019, from completing its normal conformational cycle. Single-molecule experiments show that eliminating this block by shortening the linker to a point where it can physically bypass Lis1 renders single dynein motors insensitive to regulation by Lis1. Our data reveal that Lis1 keeps dynein in a persistent microtubule-bound state by directly blocking the progression of its mechanochemical cycle."

The dynein regulator Lis1 is known to keep dynein bound to microtubules; however, how this is accomplished mechanistically remains unknown. We have used three-dimensional electron microscopy, single-molecule imaging, biochemistry, and in vivo assays to help establish this mechanism. The three-dimensional structure of the dynein\u2013Lis1 complex shows that binding of Lis1 to dynein's AAA+ ring sterically prevents dynein's main mechanical element, the \u2018linker\u2019, from completing its normal conformational cycle. Single-molecule experiments show that eliminating this block by shortening the linker to a point where it can physically bypass Lis1 renders single dynein motors insensitive to regulation by Lis1. Our data reveal that Lis1 keeps dynein in a persistent microtubule-bound state by directly blocking the progression of its mechanochemical cycle."

Removal of the tail yields the \u2018motor\u2019, the minimal portion of dynein that can exert force. At the core of the motor are six AAA+ modules (AAA1\u20136) that fold into a ring. AAA1 is the main site of ATP hydrolysis for motility but AAA2, 3, and 4 can also bind ATP, and AAA3 and 4 can hydrolyze it (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gibbons et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kon et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cho et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>). AAA5 and AAA6 have lost the ability to bind nucleotide (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>). Two appendages to the ring are essential for dynein function; the \u2018stalk\u2019, an intramolecular anti-parallel coiled-coil at the end of which lies the microtubule-binding domain (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gee et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Carter et al., 2008</a>) and the \u2018linker\u2019, which is dynein's key mechanical element and is an elongated structure N-terminal to AAA1.

Mutations in the Lis1 gene cause the neurodevelopmental disorder lissencephaly (<a href=\"#bib49\">Reiner et al., 1993</a>). Lis1 is the only dynein regulator known to interact directly with its motor domain (<a href=\"#bib40\">McKenney et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Like dynein, Lis1 acts as a dimer, with each monomer comprising an N-terminal dimerization domain (LisH) followed by a coiled-coil, a flexible loop and a C-terminal \u03b2-propeller domain of 7 WD motifs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tarricone et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). We previously showed that the propeller domain alone can regulate dynein in vitro and used negative stain electron microscopy (EM) and two-dimensional (2D) image processing to show that Lis1 binds to dynein's motor domain near AAA3/4 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). We and others have shown that Lis1 induces a slow-moving microtubule-attached state in dynein (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yamada et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">McKenney et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Torisawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, Lis1 can accomplish this without substantially affecting dynein's overall ATP hydrolysis rate (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yamada et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">McKenney et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). This led us to propose that Lis1 acts as a \u2018clutch\u2019, uncoupling dynein's engine (AAA+ ring) from its track-binding region."

On the one hand, Lis1 may regulate dynein allosterically, influencing the structure or motions of AAA3 or AAA4 in the ring, and thus preventing the propagation of a signal for microtubule detachment to the stalk. Alternatively, because the linker domain lies close to AAA4 in certain nucleotide-states, Lis1 may regulate dynein sterically, affecting the linker's movement directly, and thus dynein's mechanochemistry. Establishing Lis1's mode of regulation is not possible without three-dimensional (3D) data, as it is not known if Lis1 binds on the same face of the AAA+ ring as the linker, as would be required for direct Lis1\u2013linker interactions to occur. Moreover, it is not clear to what extent the Lis1 binding site encompasses AAA3, AAA4, or both of these modules. Thus, 3D structural information is critical to understanding the mechanistic basis of Lis1's regulation of dynein."

We obtained the 3D structure of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> dynein bound to Lis1 to determine which elements of the motor Lis1 directly affects. Our structure revealed that Lis1 sterically prevents the linker from reaching its normal post-powerstroke locations on the ATP hydrolyzing ring that are involved in its conformational cycle. Structure-based mutagenesis also allowed us to identify residues in Lis1 responsible for binding to dynein. Single molecule analysis of a dynein motor with a shortened linker that can physically bypass Lis1 indicated that removing the steric block renders dynein insensitive to Lis1. Our combined data show that Lis1 directly blocks dynein's mechanochemical cycle, inducing a persistent microtubule-bound state, by acting on its linker domain."

Cryo-NS combines the structural preservation of vitrification with the high contrast provided by the negative stain (<a href=\"#bib11\">De Carlo and Stark, 2010</a>). We found this increased contrast to be instrumental to our ability to computationally sort the different conformations that co-existed in most of our samples. We also determined a 3D map of dynein alone, as a reference, to establish whether Lis1 alters dynein's structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We used a well-characterized monomeric dynein construct (<a href=\"#bib47\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>) but chose to use dimeric rather than monomeric Lis1 for our reconstructions. We previously showed that while a Lis1 monomer is sufficient to slow down dynein, a much higher concentration of it is required (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2012</a>), presumably due to the high local concentration of the \u03b2-propeller in the context of a Lis1 dimer. Using a Lis1 dimer at much lower concentrations allowed us to minimize the background in our images."

Consequently, the rest of Lis1 would be expected to adopt a wide range of positions relative to the dynein-bound propeller domain. In agreement with this, we did not resolve density beyond that of the single \u03b2-propeller in our dynein\u2013Lis map. 2D image analysis of dynein\u2013Lis1 complexes with either monomeric or dimeric Lis1 showed the same density and location for Lis1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>), further supporting a stoichiometry of one Lis1 propeller to one dynein motor domain."

Consistent with this idea, the docked \u03b2-propeller showed a better qualitative fit and a slightly higher cross-correlation coefficient with our density map when the top face is placed at the dynein interface (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To test this docking orientation, we mutated highly conserved residues on the top face of the propeller (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Our previous finding that the KDEE residues in dynein are critical for Lis1 binding (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2012</a>) suggested that interactions between Lis1 and dynein have an electrostatic component.

Therefore, we expected that some of the Lis1 mutants that did not co-migrate with dynein might still exhibit weak but measurable regulation of the motor.

Lis1 assists in concentrating dynein at the plus ends of cytoplasmic microtubules, from where dynein is offloaded to the cell cortex (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sheeman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Roberts et al., 2014</a>). Cortically anchored dynein exerts a pulling force that results in displacements of the entire mitotic spindle (<a href=\"#bib42\">Moore et al., 2009</a>), giving rise to a brief series of oscillations across the bud neck. Deletion of dynein eliminates these oscillations (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yeh et al., 1995</a>). We quantified the effect of the Lis1<sup>5A</sup> and Lis1<sup>R378A</sup> mutants on spindle movement in cells treated with hydroxyurea, which prolongs the period of oscillations, by tracking fluorescently labeled SPBs over the course of 20 min. We found that disruption of the dynein\u2013Lis1 interface resulted in a decrease in the number of bud neck crossings to a level similar to that caused by the deletion of Lis1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

However, since dynein from the same species had not been visualized in both the no nucleotide and ADP states, and because different constructs were used in the studies cited above, it was uncertain whether the AAA4 and AAA5 linker positions corresponded to distinct mechanochemical states or were due to differences between dynein species and/or constructs."

The AAA4 position was seen only in the presence of ADP and was not detectable in no nucleotide conditions. These results suggest that the linker docks at AAA5 in the absence of nucleotide but can coexist in the AAA4- and AAA5-interacting states in the presence of ADP. Importantly, both the AAA4 linker position in the ADP state and the AAA5 position in the no nucleotide state are sterically incompatible with the presence of Lis1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

First, we designed a monomeric dynein construct to use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure linker movement to AAA2. We based our design, which used <i>S. cerevisiae</i> dynein, on a linker sensor developed for <i>D. discoideum</i> dynein (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kon et al., 2005</a>). In our construct, we fused an eGFP donor to the N-terminus of the linker and coupled a tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) acceptor to AAA2 via a small acetyl-CoA-binding tag (ybbR [<a href=\"#bib66\">Yin et al., 2005</a>]) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This dynein construct (GFP-dynein<sub>FRET/A2</sub>) slides microtubules robustly, with gliding rates \u223c90% of wild-type dynein (GFP-dynein<sub>331kDa</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), showing that the tags are compatible with motor function. Under no nucleotide conditions, and in the absence of Lis1, this construct showed a low FRET efficiency (\u223c2%), as expected when the linker is docked at AAA5 (post-powerstroke position) and the FRET donor and acceptor are far apart (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In the presence of ATP and vanadate (V<sub>i</sub>), which trap dynein as an ADP.V<sub>i</sub>-bound complex after hydrolysis, FRET increased to \u223c26% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Under these conditions, the linker is biased towards the pre-powerstroke position at AAA2 and the fluorophores lie closer together. When Lis1 was added to ADP.V<sub>i</sub>\u2013dynein, there was no significant change in the FRET efficiency relative to ADP.V<sub>i</sub>\u2013dynein alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). When dynein was incubated with Lis1 before adding ATP and V<sub>i</sub>, the FRET efficiency decreased somewhat but remained close to that observed for ADP.V<sub>i</sub>\u2013dynein alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). These results suggest that Lis1 does not affect the linker pre-powerstroke AAA2 position (ATP + V<sub>i</sub> added before Lis1) and has only a minor effect on linkers undergoing the AAA5 to AAA2 transition (Lis1 added before ATP + V<sub>i</sub>)."

We could resolve the linker in the expected pre-powerstroke position towards AAA2 and the density for the Lis1 \u03b2-propeller at the AAA3/4 junction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>).

We wondered whether motility regulation was a result of this steric blocking by Lis1. Specifically, we wanted to test the hypothesis that steric blocking of the linker is necessary for inducing dynein's Lis1-dependent state of persistent microtubule attachment. To test this hypothesis, we used a dynein construct with a truncated linker that is long enough to form a functional motor but is too short to be sterically blocked by Lis1. This construct is generated by deleting 145 amino acids at the N-terminus of the dynein motor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

Central to our testing the steric block hypothesis, our 3D structure of the short linker dynein\u2013Lis1 complex shows the same conformation for the linker in the presence of Lis1 as we had observed for the full-length linker in the absence of Lis1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Therefore, the short linker is functional and able to physically bypass Lis1."

In this study, the duration of single monomeric dynein's attachments to microtubules can be measured by kymograph analysis in a flow chamber by TIRF microscopy (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Addition of ATP triggers a low-affinity state in dynein (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Imamula et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2012</a>) and the dynein monomers release from microtubules, resulting in a loss of fluorescence signal. Microtubule rebinding events are short lived, likely corresponding to single turnovers of ATP. In the presence of a full-length linker, Lis1 converted dynein to a state of persistent microtubule attachment and dynein monomers stayed bound in the presence of ATP for extended periods as previously shown (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Strikingly, shortening of dynein's linker eliminated Lis1's ability to induce this persistent microtubule-bound state. We quantified the durations of microtubule attachments after the addition of ATP and found the same short-lived attachments seen with dynein in the absence of Lis1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013F</a>). Thus, Lis1 is not capable of regulating microtubule attachment in the short linker construct. These data support a steric mode of dynein regulation where Lis1 physically blocks the linker."

Our data suggest that when Lis1 is present, the linker retains its ability to adopt the pre-powerstroke AAA2 position but is prevented from reaching its normal post-powerstroke positions at AAA4 and AAA5 on dynein's ring (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This blocking of the linker by Lis1 is critical for motility regulation; its removal by shortening dynein's linker renders the motor Lis1 insensitive."

                        "text": "Why does Lis1's blocking the linker from adopting its normal post-powerstroke positions prevent dynein's microtubule detachment? One possibility suggested by our structures is that Lis1 disrupts the interaction between the linker and AAA5, preventing normal progression through the mechanochemical cycle. Consistent with this notion, when linker docking at AAA5 is abolished by mutagenesis, dynein displays reduced velocity and prolonged microtubule attachments (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>), reminiscent of Lis1's effects. However, while Lis1 has little effect on dynein's ATPase, AAA5 linker docking mutants display severely reduced ATPase rates, both in the absence (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>) and the presence of Lis1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Given these results, it is not clear at this point what the mechanistic basis is for dynein's continuing ATPase in the presence of Lis1. On the one hand, it is possible that the AAA5 mutations may, in addition to preventing linker docking, disrupt dynein's mechanochemical cycle and thus also prevent ATP hydrolysis. A method to reversibly block linker docking at AAA5 (e.g., via a small molecule) would be required to determine if AAA5 docking is truly required for dynein ATPase activity. On the other hand, Lis1 may uncouple ATP hydrolysis from linker docking at AAA5 through an allosteric effect on the ring. In this scenario, the linker\u2013AAA5 interaction, which is blocked by Lis1, would be required for the conformational changes that ultimately shift dynein's microtubule-binding domain to its low-affinity state, but not for dynein's continuing ATPase activity. Higher resolution structures of the dynein\u2013Lis1 complex will be required to establish whether Lis1 has an effect on the structure of dynein's ring."

Similarly, Lis1 may interact specifically with the linker itself. Either (or both) of these scenarios could in turn be responsible for preventing microtubule release. However, current evidence does not favor these possibilities. Low sequence conservation in the portion of the linker facing Lis1 argues against a specific Lis1\u2013linker interaction (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). Likewise, a specific interaction between a Lis1-displaced linker and dynein's ring is not supported by the apparent conformational heterogeneity of the N-terminus of the linker in the presence of Lis1, where 3D sorting is required to resolve linker positions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013H</a>). Also mutating five amino acids on AAA4, proximal to the linker's displaced position (the most likely candidates to interact with the displaced linker), had minimal effect on Lis1-mediated motility regulation (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A direct test of whether specific interactions exist among these different elements will also require a higher resolution structure, where the rotational orientation of the Lis1 homology model within its density in the EM map is unequivocal and specific interactions between the linker and Lis1 as well as the linker and the dynein ring can be distinguished from physical proximity."

This allows Lis1 to keep dynein in a persistent microtubule-bound state. This modulation of dynein's interaction with its microtubule track likely contributes to dynein's ability to carry out the variety of cellular functions it performs in different organisms, given the conservation of the amino acids at the dynein\u2013Lis1 interface. For example, Lis1 is involved in initiation of cargo transport (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lenz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Egan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Moughamian et al., 2013</a>), in transport of high load cargo (<a href=\"#bib40\">McKenney et al., 2010</a>), and in targeting dynein molecules to the cell cortex via the microtubule plus end (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sheeman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Roberts et al., 2014</a>). The displaced linker observed in the presence of Lis1 in our 3D dynein\u2013Lis1 reconstruction may contribute to this latter task, generating an \u2018unmasked\u2019 tail domain that has been shown necessary for cortical dynein localization (<a href=\"#bib39\">Markus and Lee, 2011</a>). In the case of the mammalian proteins, dynein and Lis1 were previously shown to form a stable complex only in ATP and V<sub>i</sub> conditions (<a href=\"#bib40\">McKenney et al., 2010</a>). Our 3D reconstruction of dynein\u2013Lis1 under those conditions suggests that this might be a consequence of the linker's moving to its pre-powerstroke site at AAA2, where the linker and Lis1 are no longer sterically incompatible."

The high reproducibility we were able to achieve with cryo-NS allowed us to sample a much greater range of constructs/nucleotide conditions in the same time frame than we would otherwise have been able to do in unstained, unsupported conditions. Most importantly, the improved contrast was instrumental in allowing us to sort the different dynein conformations that were present in most of our data sets. 4 \u03bcl of monomeric dynein (80\u2013120 nM), or monomeric dynein pre-incubated for 10 min with Lis1 dimer at a 1.5-fold excess (120\u2013180 nM), was applied to a glow discharged, continuous carbon coated, C-flat EM grids (Protochips, Raleigh, NC). Dynein samples stated to be prepared in no nucleotide conditions were treated with apyrase (0.14 U/ml) for 15 min prior to grid application to hydrolyze residual ADP left over from the dynein purification procedure.

For some experiments, dynein was first incubated with 200 \u03bcM ATP.V<sub>i</sub> for 2 min at RT, followed by Lis1 for 1 hr on ice. Assays were performed in 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT and the final concentrations of dynein and Lis1 were 84 nM and 840 nM, respectively. The sample was excited with 485 nm (eGFP) light, and the emitted light was detected from 505 nm to 650 nm in a SpectraMax M5 fluorimeter (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at RT. In order to normalize across experiments, the samples were also excited with 535 nm (TMR) light and the emitted light was detected from 555 nm to 700 nm. To analyze the FRET data, we first subtracted the fluorescence background from the buffer alone. We then used the emission spectra of dynein-labeled with eGFP and free TMR dye alone to decompose each channel in the experimental spectra. FRET efficiencies (E) were calculated using the method of Clegg (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clegg, 1995</a>): E = {<i>F</i><sup>a</sup><sub>FRET</sub>/<i>F</i><sup>a</sup><sub>DIR</sub> \u2212 \u03b5<sup>a</sup>(485)/\u03b5<sup>a</sup>(535)}\u03b5<sup>a</sup>(535)/\u03b5<sup>d</sup>(485), where the superscripts \u2018d\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 refer to the donor (eGFP) and the acceptor (TMR), respectively. <i>F</i><sup>a</sup><sub>FRET</sub> is the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor excited at 485 nm and <i>F</i><sup>a</sup><sub>DIR</sub> is the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor excited at 535 nm. \u03b5<sup>d</sup>(485) \u03b5<sup>a</sup>(485) and \u03b5<sup>a</sup>(535) are the molar extinction coefficients at the designated wavelengths. In our experiments \u03b5<sup>a</sup>(535)/\u03b5<sup>d</sup>(485) = 37,900 M<sup>\u22121</sup> cm<sup>\u22121</sup>/40,000 M<sup>\u22121</sup> cm<sup>\u22121</sup> and \u03b5<sup>a</sup>(485)/\u03b5<sup>a</sup>(535) = 0.2."

Based on this finding, the authors carried out a series of well-designed biochemical and biophysical experiments to probe the mechanical relationship between bound Lis1 and the linker arm. By docking in previously determined atomic coordinates, the resulting pseudo-atomic models served as a framework for the mutagenesis and FRET experiments, which provided insight into the relationship between Lis1, nucleotide state, and the linker arm position. Truncation of the linker arm, single molecule motility experiments, and in vivo assays were performed to confirm the author's model for Lis1 regulation. Ultimately, the authors conclude that Lis1 serves as a molecular barricade, sterically preventing ATP hydrolysis from being converted into the conformational rearrangements that weaken microtubule binding."

We chose two different sequences to add back to the short linker dynein to restore the wild type linker length: (1) The sequence from <i>S. pombe</i>, which appears to lack a Lis1 homolog; and (2) The sequence from an axonemal dynein from <i>C. reinhardtii</i> (dynein-c), which does not bind axonemal Lis1. Our goal was to then use single-molecule microtubule binding/release assays on these chimeric dyneins, alone and in the presence of Lis1, to test if Lis1 regulation was restored. Unfortunately, the chimeric axonemal dynein failed to express. The chimeric <i>S. pombe</i> dynein did not express well, either, but we were able to purify amounts that were sufficient for single-molecule studies. However, this chimeric dynein showed a disrupted mechanochemical cycle: it was unable to release from microtubules in the presence of ATP even in the absence of Lis1. We agree that additional evidence for the steric block hypothesis would have strengthened our model; unfortunately, given the results described above, this does seem to be too tall an order to be accomplished in a reasonable time frame."

Small differences in density likely arise from different dilutions used. Regarding rebinding events, apart from cases where Lis1 triggers a clear persistent microtubule attachment state in dynein (i.e. full-length linker dynein with Lis1), comparative measurements are not very meaningful as rebinding events are in part dependent on the buffer flow rate through each flow chamber, which guides the rate of clearance of dynein molecules released from microtubules. This flow rate is manually driven via a syringe; so, it too can vary slightly between assays. Therefore, we do not base any of our conclusions on rebinding frequency.

This is followed by a transition to the ADP.Vi like state with a low affinity, pre-powerstroke conformation. The ATP bound, post-powerstroke, low affinity conformation could be altered so that it no longer releases from microtubules by a combination of Lis1 AND linker binding to the AAA+ ring</i>."

However, our short linker experiments do suggest that steric regulation via the linker is critical for this regulation (i.e. it cannot be purely allosteric)."
