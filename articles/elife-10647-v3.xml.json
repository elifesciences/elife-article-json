The processes that modulate SOX2 activity to promote pluripotency are not well understood. Here, we show SOX2 is <i>O</i>-GlcNAc modified in its transactivation domain during reprogramming and in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Upon induction of differentiation SOX2 <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation at serine 248 is decreased. Replacing wild type with an <i>O</i>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 (S248A) increases reprogramming efficiency. ESCs with <i>O</i>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 exhibit alterations in gene expression. This change correlates with altered protein-protein interactions and genomic occupancy of the <i>O</i>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 compared to wild type. In addition, SOX2 <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation impairs the SOX2-PARP1 interaction, which has been shown to regulate ESC self-renewal. These findings show that SOX2 activity is modulated by <i>O</i>-GlcNAc, and provide a novel regulatory mechanism for this crucial pluripotency transcription factor."

The processes that modulate SOX2 activity to promote pluripotency are not well understood. Here, we show SOX2 is <i>O</i>-GlcNAc modified in its transactivation domain during reprogramming and in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Upon induction of differentiation SOX2 <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation at serine 248 is decreased. Replacing wild type with an <i>O</i>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 (S248A) increases reprogramming efficiency. ESCs with <i>O</i>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 exhibit alterations in gene expression. This change correlates with altered protein-protein interactions and genomic occupancy of the <i>O</i>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 compared to wild type. In addition, SOX2 <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation impairs the SOX2-PARP1 interaction, which has been shown to regulate ESC self-renewal. These findings show that SOX2 activity is modulated by <i>O</i>-GlcNAc, and provide a novel regulatory mechanism for this crucial pluripotency transcription factor."

Replacement of wild type SOX2 (SOX2<sup>WT</sup>) with an <i>O-</i>GlcNAc-deficient mutant SOX2 (SOX2<sup>S248A</sup>) results in increased reprogramming efficiency. mESCs with SOX2<sup>S248A</sup> as their sole source of SOX2 have increased expression of genes associated with pluripotency and exhibit a decreased requirement for OCT4.

Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis of SOX2 in self-renewal conditions revealed four main populations of the TAD peptide containing serine 248 (hereinafter referred to as TAD peptide): unmodified, <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylated at one of two sites (S248 or T258), phosphorylated at S253, and doubly modified with <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation at S248 and phosphorylation at S253, (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1A\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s5\">5</a>).

However, the effects of this, or any, PTM are likely to be context specific, and determined by the transcription factors and signaling molecules present in each cell type. GlcNAc-S248 may inhibit SOX2 activity in mESCs, where the decrease in this PTM may alter SOX2 activity upon differentiation, such that SOX2 functions appropriately for the changing cellular context.

Together these results suggest the <i>O</i>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 may exhibit an altered reliance on OCT4 for binding and regulation of gene expression. Further studies aimed at querying the effects of the S248A mutation on genome-wide OCT4 distribution should provide insight into whether this SOX2 PTM alters OCT4 association with target sequences, and may address if <i>O</i>-GlcNAc impacts OCT4/SOX2 heterodimerization."

In both these studies, differentiation of mESCs promotes the PARP1-SOX2 interaction.

During differentiation, the SOX2-PARP1 interaction inhibits SOX2 binding to enhancers of genes that are necessary for self-renewal (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lai et al., 2012</a>). We find that SOX2<sup>S248A</sup> exhibits increased association with PARP1 without decreased occupancy of pluripotency genes under self-renewal conditions.

Here, they show that <i>O-</i>GlcNac-modified SOX2 decreases with differentiation and increases during reprogramming into iPSCs. Ectopic expression of a mutant form of SOX2 that cannot be <i>O-</i>GlcNac-modified (S248A) in ESCs supports self-renewal, gives rise to less differentiated colonies and suppresses differentiation. Similarly, ectopic expression of S248A in combination with Oct4, Klf4and c-Myc gives rise to more iPSC colonies than OCT4, SOX2 (WT), Klf4 and c-Myc expression. The authors finally show that ESCs expressing SOX2 S248A form associate with ca. 1,000 loci that are different from WT SOX2 in ESCs and lack nearby OCT4 binding sites. Moreover, proteomic analysis suggests that the S248A form of SOX2 associates less efficiently with PARP1 and other proteins, thus providing a partial explanation for the differentiation defect of mutant ESCs. This study makes a number of interesting observations on a modification that has received a lot of attention in the stem cell field over the last few years. This is an interesting area and this approach is an important one. The manuscript should be acceptable for publication once the authors eliminate the weaknesses outlined below. Various concerns can be addressed by editing text and labels, and by clarifying experimental details in particular with respect to statistics/quantification/replicates. In addition, there is a need for a few additional experiments to confirm the validity of some of the main findings and conclusions, which are perceived by all reviewers as relatively straightforward for the authors."

In the Methods section we indicate that we performed two biological replicates (each with technical duplicates, for a total of 4 replicates) of the ChIP-seq. We now also state that replicates were performed in the figure legend accompanying the text. The files are deposited in GEO and available to the reviewers. Thus the 1000 new sites occupied in mutant relative to wild type (representing a 25% increase in the number of sites) are not likely to be due to ChIP-to ChIP variability."

ChIP-qPCR doesn't provide the type of resolution necessary to indicate where the binding motif lies within the amplicon (in contrast to ChIP-seq, in which read counts indicate SOX2 and OCT4 peaks abut each other in the OCT4-SOX2 motif found in many active promoters in ESCs). Indeed, if we query for OCT4 motifs +/- 100 bp, a substantial fraction of S248A specific sites contain a predicted OCT4 binding site. Therefore, to address whether OCT4 is bound nearby SOX2 at the S248A-specific sites, ChIP-seq will be necessary. Performing such a ChIP-seq experiment is outside the scope of this manuscript, but is certainly something we will pursue in the future. For the resubmission we have changed the presentation of the analysis of ChIP-seq data. Instead of restricting our query to +/-20 bp of the SOX2 peaks, we used de novo motif identification to determine in an unbiased way what motifs predominant in the SOX2 peaks shared by wild type and S248A and in the S248A-specific peaks. Using this method, the canonical SOX2 motif is identified in the S248A-specific peaks and the canonical OCT4:SOX2 motif is identified in the peaks shared between wild type and mutant. This presentation more clearly highlights that mutant SOX2 site specificity is different from that of wild type SOX2."

Also, it is obvious that OGT will interact with SOX2 but this interaction itself may impact the interaction of SOX2 with PARP1.

We then took the ratio of (ProteinX/SOX2-WT)/(ProteinX/SOX2-S248A). The ratios for all proteins were used to determine the variance of the data, and ultimately which proteins were more enriched by WT or mutant SOX2.
