We discovered that subsets of these stromal cells, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and hypertrophic chondrocytes secrete a C-type lectin domain protein, Clec11a, which promotes osteogenesis. <i>Clec11a</i>-deficient mice appeared developmentally normal and had normal hematopoiesis but reduced limb and vertebral bone. <i>Clec11a</i>-deficient mice exhibited accelerated bone loss during aging, reduced bone strength, and delayed fracture healing. Bone marrow stromal cells from <i>Clec11a</i>-deficient mice showed impaired osteogenic differentiation, but normal adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. Recombinant Clec11a promoted osteogenesis by stromal cells in culture and increased bone mass in osteoporotic mice in vivo. Recombinant human Clec11a promoted osteogenesis by human bone marrow stromal cells in culture and in vivo. Clec11a thus maintains the adult skeleton by promoting the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors into mature osteoblasts. In light of this, we propose to call this factor Osteolectin."

Addition of rClec11a to these cultures did not significantly affect the percentage of cells that formed CFU-F or the number of cells per colony (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u00a0and B</a>). Upon induction of differentiation, rClec11a significantly increased the number of alkaline phosphatase positive osteoblasts per colony (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This appeared to reflect a promotion of differentiation as rClec11a did not significantly affect the frequencies of dividing osteoblasts (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) or osteoblasts undergoing apoptosis within the colonies (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>).

Tetranectin deficient mice exhibit kyphosis as a result of asymmetric growth plate development in vertebrae (<a href=\"#bib22\">Iba et al., 2001</a>); however, it is unknown whether Tetranectin is required for osteogenesis in vivo. Tetranectin is found in both cartilaginous fish and bony fish but Clec11a/Osteolectin is only found in bony fish and higher vertebrate species. This suggests that Clec11a/Osteolectin evolved in bony species to promote osteogenic differentiation and mineralization. Among mammals Clec11a/Osteolectin is highly conserved: human and mouse Clec11a/Osteolectin proteins are 85% identical and 90% similar.

The femurs were rehydrated in PBS for at least 3 hr before testing, and then kept in a humidified chamber and preconditioned with 20 cycles of bending displacement (0.1 mm). Without immersion, the femurs were loaded to fracture with three-point bending (each holding point was 4 mm from the middle break point) under displacement control (3 mm/min) using a material testing system (Instron model # 5565, Norwood, MA)."

Clec11a maintains the adult skeleton by promoting osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors. The authors first determined that Clec11a is highly expressed in skeletal lineage cells by gene and protein expression analyses. They then employed the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate a Clec11a knock out mouse to test if Clec11a is necessary for hematopoiesis and osteogenesis in vivo. They found that Clec11a deficiency led to weaker bones under conditions of normal homeostasis and also after fracture healing. The authors also tested whether administration of recombinant Clec11a is sufficient to prevent and reverse osteoporosis using micro-CT and histomorphometric analyses. The identification of Clec11a as a novel agonist of bone maintenance and fracture healing is of high interest and the data presented are very compelling. While the study does not define a clear molecular mechanism of action for Clec11a, multiple models of osteoporosis were used to demonstrate the efficacy of rClec11a, greatly strengthening the clinical relevance of the study."

Since adult male mice have significantly higher BV/TV values than female mice (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; JBMR 22:1197), it is not surprising that the 2 month-old BV/TV value in the control mice of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> (around 10%) is higher than in the rest of the manuscript (4-8%). Thus, the differences in BV/TV values in different figures mainly reflect expected biological differences, not experimental error.
