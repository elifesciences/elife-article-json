                    "text": "In response to environments that cause cellular stress, animals engage in sleep behavior that facilitates recovery from the stress. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, stress-induced sleep(SIS) is regulated by cytokine activation of the ALA neuron, which releases FLP-13 neuropeptides characterized by an amidated arginine-phenylalanine (RFamide) C-terminus motif. By performing an unbiased genetic screen for mutants that impair the somnogenic effects of FLP-13 neuropeptides, we identified the gene <i>dmsr-1</i>, which encodes a G-protein coupled receptor similar to an insect RFamide receptor. DMSR-1 is activated by FLP-13 peptides in cell culture, is required for SIS <i>in vivo</i>, is expressed non-synaptically in several wake-promoting neurons, and likely couples to a Gi/o heterotrimeric G-protein. Our data expand our understanding of how a single neuroendocrine cell coordinates an organism-wide behavioral response, and suggest that similar signaling principles may function in other organisms to regulate sleep during sickness."

In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, stress-induced sleep(SIS) is regulated by cytokine activation of the ALA neuron, which releases FLP-13 neuropeptides characterized by an amidated arginine-phenylalanine (RFamide) C-terminus motif. By performing an unbiased genetic screen for mutants that impair the somnogenic effects of FLP-13 neuropeptides, we identified the gene <i>dmsr-1</i>, which encodes a G-protein coupled receptor similar to an insect RFamide receptor. DMSR-1 is activated by FLP-13 peptides in cell culture, is required for SIS <i>in vivo</i>, is expressed non-synaptically in several wake-promoting neurons, and likely couples to a Gi/o heterotrimeric G-protein. Our data expand our understanding of how a single neuroendocrine cell coordinates an organism-wide behavioral response, and suggest that similar signaling principles may function in other organisms to regulate sleep during sickness."

As such, scientists would like to know which cells in the nervous system FLP-13 interacts with, what receptor the cells use to recognize this chemical, and whether it turns on cells that induce sleep or turns off the cells that cause wakefulness."

The experiments sifted through genetic mutations to determine which ones cause the worms not to fall asleep when FLP-13 is released. This revealed that worms with a mutation that causes them to lack a receptor protein called DMSR-1 do not become sleepy in response to FLP-13. This suggests that DMSR-1 must be essential for FLP-13 to trigger sleep. About 10% of cells in the worm\u2019s nervous system have the DMSR-1 receptor. Some of these neurons tell the worm to move forward or to forage around for food. The experiments also showed that FLP-13 is probably not the only chemical that interacts with the DMSR-1 receptor, but the identities of these other chemicals remain unknown."

During acute infectious illness in mammals, electrophysiological correlates of sleep behavior are observed (<a href=\"#bib43\">Toth and Krueger, 1988</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">1989</a>), indicating that the behavioral sequence is sleep. In the arthropod <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Williams et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lenz et al., 2015</a>) and the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hill et al., 2014</a>), acute illness results in cellular stress, which then induces a sleep behavior: the animals stop moving and feeding, do not respond to weak stimuli but move normally in response to strong stimuli (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hill et al., 2014</a>). This stress-induced sleep (SIS, also known as sickness sleep) is beneficial to the animal and helps it recover from the acute injury (<a href=\"#bib41\">Spiegel et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hill et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kuo and Williams, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Fry et al., 2016</a>).

In the absence of stress, nematodes experience sleep only when they transition between larval stages but do not sleep in the adult stage. Since <i>C. elegans</i> does not have an identifiable circadian rhythm of sleep, adult nematodes are an ideal system to study SIS in the absence of the circadian and homeostatic effects of animals that require daily sleep."

The acute illness can occur outside of the brain yet affect behavior, suggesting that communication occurs between non-neural and neural tissues. Cytokine signaling is involved. For example, in mammals, the cytokines interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha, whose levels increase during an infectious challenge, are each sufficient to induce sleep when injected into the brain (reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib17\">Krueger, 2008</a>). In nematodes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Van Buskirk and Sternberg, 2007</a>), arthropods (<a href=\"#bib6\">Foltenyi et al., 2007</a>), and mammals (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kushikata et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kramer et al., 2001</a>), signaling by epidermal growth factor (EGF) is sufficient to induce sleep behavior and, at least in nematodes, EGF signaling is necessary for SIS (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hill et al., 2014</a>).

Both locomotion quiescence and feeding quiescence induced by <i>flp-13</i> can be reversed by activation of motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Trojanowski et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that <i>flp-13</i> mediates quiescence at the level of the nervous system. Furthermore, quiescence induced by <i>flp-13</i> requires the G protein alpha subunit GOA-1 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Trojanowski et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that these peptides signal through a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). There are more than 150 genes in the <i>C. elegans</i> genome predicted to encode neuropeptide receptor GPCRs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Frooninckx et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hobert, 2013</a>). In prior detailed analysis of one of these GPCRs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nelson et al., 2015</a>), we showed that while FRPR-4 can be activated by FLP-13 peptides in cell-based assay, its genetic removal does not abrogate <i>flp-13</i> induced quiescence in vivo, suggesting that it is not the receptor mediating the quiescence-inducing effects of FLP-13 peptides in response to cellular stress. Since we had no strong <i>a priori</i> reason to implicate other specific GPCRs, we took a hypothesis-independent forward genetic screen approach to identify the FLP-13 receptor (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yuan et al., 2015</a>). We here identify the GPCR DMSR-1 (<span class=\"underline\">D</span>ro<span class=\"underline\">M</span>yo<span class=\"underline\">S</span>uppressin <span class=\"underline\">R</span>eceptor related-1) as required for <i>flp-13</i> somnogenic effects. DMSR-1 is expressed in about one tenth of all <i>C. elegans</i> neurons and localizes diffusely to membranes. FLP-13 peptides can activate the receptor directly, indicating that DMSR-1 is likely an in vivo receptor for FLP-13 neuropeptides. Inhibition of neurons where <i>dmsr-1</i> is expressed enhances the effect of <i>flp-13</i>, suggesting that DMSR-1 transduces the FLP-13 signal by reducing activity of wake-promoting\u00a0neurons."

The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jones et al., 1992</a>). The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The analysis involved 35 amino acid sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 181 positions in the final dataset.

Four of the mutants (<i>qn44</i>, <i>qn49</i>, <i>qn51</i> and <i>qn53</i>) contained premature stop codons.

We Sanger sequenced the <i>dmsr-1</i> gene in <i>qn40</i>, and found a premature stop mutation in exon 4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

To test whether <i>dmsr-1</i> was required for SIS after exposure to other temperatures, we exposed cohorts of animals to temperatures ranging from 29 to 37 degrees Celsius. The <i>dmsr-1(qn45)</i> mutation suppressed SIS at temperatures ranging from 34 to 37 degrees (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To test whether <i>dmsr-1</i> was required for sleep in response to stressors other than heat, we exposed animals to ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation. UVC induced a strong body movement quiescent response, which was attenuated in the <i>dmsr-1(qn45)</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We partially restored SIS in <i>dmsr-1</i> mutants by expressing a genomic fragment of <i>dmsr-1</i> including the coding region and 4 kb of upstream regulatory DNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). It is possible that the incomplete rescue of SIS is due to an absence of <i>dmsr-1</i> in the full complement of cells where it acts. This incomplete expression may be due to the nature of our extrachromosomal DNA array, which is not inherited by every somatic cell. Alternatively, it is possible that the genomic DNA fragment does not contain all required <i>dmsr-1</i> regulatory elements. While <i>dmsr-1</i> mutants were defective in quiescence associated with SIS, they had normal quiescence associated with DTS (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>), as previously shown for <i>flp-13</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nelson et al., 2014</a>), supporting the notion that the DTS and SIS are regulated at least partially differently (<a href=\"#bib45\">Trojanowski et al., 2015</a>)."

The WorMotel is a PDMS device that contains a series of wells filled with NGM agar so that individual worms can be housed separately for longitudinal tracking. The chip was imaged under dark field microscopy using red light to indirectly illuminate worms from below a glass stage as described. Images were taken every ten seconds at a spatial resolution of 16 microns per pixel. Images were analyzed using custom software that subtracts pairs of successive images as previously described (<a href=\"#bib35\">Raizen et al., 2008</a>). Body movement activity was quantified as the total number of pixels changed in the subtracted images, and quiescent epochs were those in which no pixel movement was detected between a pair of frames.

Briefly, DMSR-1A cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) TOPO expression vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham Massachusetts). Receptor activation was studied in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) stably expressing apo-aequorin (mtAEQ) targeted to the mitochondria as well as the human Galpha16 subunit. We used the CHO-K1 cell line (PerkinElmer, ES-000-A2) for receptor activation assays. Quality control and authentication was performed by determining the EC50 for reference agonists (e.g. ATP) in an AequoScreen calcium mobilization assay. A mycoplasma test was performed using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma (Lonza) detection kit. This cell line tested negative for mycoplasma."

Cell lines were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and were diluted fifteen-fold every third day. CHO/mtAEQ/Galpha16 cells were transiently transfected with the DMSR-1 cDNA construct or the empty pcDNA3.1(+) vector using the Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Thermofisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells expressing the receptor were shifted to 28\u00b0C 1 day later, and collected 2 days post-transfection in BSA medium (DMEM/HAM\u2019s F12 with 15 mM HEPES, without phenol red, supplemented with 0.1% BSA) and loaded with 5 \u03bcM coelenterazine h (Thermo Fisher) for 4 hr to reconstitute the holo-enzyme aequorin. Cells (25,000 cells/well) were exposed to synthetic peptides in BSA medium, and aequorin bioluminescence was recorded for 30 s on a MicroBeta LumiJet luminometer (PerkinElmer,\u00a0Waltham\u00a0Massachusetts) in quadruplicate. For dose-response evaluations, after 30 s of ligand-stimulated calcium measurements, Triton X-100 (0.1%) was added to the well to obtain a measure of the maximum cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. BSA medium without the peptides was used as a negative control and 1 \u03bcM ATP was used to check the functional response of the cells. Cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 empty vector were used as a negative control for the effect of the receptor. EC50 values were calculated from dose-response curves, constructed using a computerized nonlinear regression analysis, with a sigmoidal dose-response equation (Prism 6.0)."

Using a mutagenesis screen, the authors found that a number of mutants that failed to respond to overexpression of <i>flp-13</i>, and therefore presumably over-stimulation by the FLP-13 peptides had a variety of mutations in the <i>dmsr-1</i> gene, leading to a failed DMSR-1 receptor. They went on to show that the DMSR-1 receptor binds to the FLP-13 peptides, that it is required for stress-induced sleep, that the <i>dmsr-1</i> gene is expressed in the nervous system (in a number of specific neurons), and finally that the likely mechanism for the effects of DMSR-1 activation on stress-induced sleep are likely mediated by an inhibition of wake-promoting neurons rather than by an activation of sleep-inducing neurons."

Complex neural circuits regulate sleep, and investigating sleep regulation in the nematode's relatively simple nervous system has potential to identify defined circuits regulating this process, and how they are modulated by environmental change. These findings build upon previous work identifying the ALA neurons as mediating stress-induced changes in sleep by release of FLP-13 neuropeptide. The identification of DMSR-1 as a target of FLP-13 provides a system for examining neurohormonal modulation of sleep in response to environmental or physiological changes. The experiments are technically sound and will have broad impact on the sleep community. Below I list a number of comments, mostly minor, that I believe would increase the accessibility and impact of this manuscript."
