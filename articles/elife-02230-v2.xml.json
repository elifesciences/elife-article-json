So far, most studies have focused on how fast TFs diffuse, underestimating the role of nuclear architecture. We implemented a single-molecule tracking assay to determine TFs dynamics. We found that c-Myc is a global explorer of the nucleus. In contrast, the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb is a local explorer that oversamples its environment. Consequently, each c-Myc molecule is equally available for all nuclear sites while P-TEFb reaches its targets in a position-dependent manner. Our observations are consistent with a model in which the exploration geometry of TFs is restrained by their interactions with nuclear structures and not by exclusion. The geometry-controlled kinetics of TFs target-search illustrates the influence of nuclear architecture on gene regulation, and has strong implications on how proteins react in the nucleus and how their function can be regulated in space and time."

So far, most studies have focused on how fast TFs diffuse, underestimating the role of nuclear architecture. We implemented a single-molecule tracking assay to determine TFs dynamics. We found that c-Myc is a global explorer of the nucleus. In contrast, the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb is a local explorer that oversamples its environment. Consequently, each c-Myc molecule is equally available for all nuclear sites while P-TEFb reaches its targets in a position-dependent manner. Our observations are consistent with a model in which the exploration geometry of TFs is restrained by their interactions with nuclear structures and not by exclusion. The geometry-controlled kinetics of TFs target-search illustrates the influence of nuclear architecture on gene regulation, and has strong implications on how proteins react in the nucleus and how their function can be regulated in space and time."

These works have set a framework to interpret the mobility of macromolecular complexes in the cell, and recently in terms of kinetics of biochemical reactions (<a href=\"#bib12\">Condamin et al., 2007</a>). Experimental evidence has also been found, showing the influence of the glass-like properties of the bacterial cytoplasm in the molecular dynamics of intracellular processes (<a href=\"#bib59\">Parry et al., 2014</a>). These studies demonstrate that the geometry of the medium in which diffusion takes place has important repercussions for the search kinetics of molecules. The notion of <i>compact</i> and <i>non-compact</i> exploration was introduced by <a href=\"#bib16\">de Gennes (1982a)</a> in the context of dense polymers and describes two fundamental types of diffusive behavior. While a <i>non-compact</i> explorer leaves a significant number of available sites unvisited, a <i>compact</i> explorer performs a redundant exploration of the space.

To this end, we used single-molecule (SM) imaging to address the relationship between the nuclear geometry and the search dynamics of two nuclear factors having distinct functional roles: the proto-oncogene c-Myc and the positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb). c-Myc is a basic helix-loop-helix DNA-binding transcription factor that binds to E-Boxes; 18,000 E-boxes are found in the genome, and c-Myc affects the transcription of numerous genes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gallant and Steiger, 2009</a>). Recently, c-Myc has been demonstrated to be a general transcriptional activator upregulating transcription of nearly all genes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Nie et al., 2012</a>). P-TEFb is an essential actor in the transcription regulation driven by RNA Polymerase II. P-TEFb is a cyclin-dependent kinase, comprising a CDK9 and a Cyclin T subunit. It phosphorylates the elongation control factors SPT5 and NELF to allow productive elongation of class II gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wada et al., 1998</a>). The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the catalytic subunit RPB1 of polymerase II is also a major target of P-TEFb (<a href=\"#bib79\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). c-Myc and P-TEFb are therefore two good examples of transcriptional regulators binding to numerous sites in the nucleus; the latter binds to the transcription machinery itself and the former directly to DNA."

Recently, the tracking of single nuclear factors has been facilitated by the advent of efficient in situ tagging methods such as Halo tags (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mazza et al., 2012</a>). An alternative approach takes advantage of photoconvertible tags (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lippincott-Schwartz and Patterson, 2009</a>) and photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Betzig et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hess et al., 2006</a>). Single particle tracking PALM (sptPALM) was first used to achieve high-density diffusion maps of membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib47\">Manley et al., 2008</a>).

A careful control of the photoconversion rate minimized the background signal due to out-of-focus activated molecules, and we could thus follow the motion of individual proteins freely diffusing within the nuclear volume.

(<b>B</b>) Schematics of the intracellular sptPALM; wide-field illumination is necessary in order to reach the nucleus of mammalian cells. A signature of single molecule detection is the on/off single-step fluorescence shown in panel (<b>C</b>). To achieve single molecule detection, 405 nm laser photoactivation needs to be reduced to a level where no background noise is produced by out-of-focus fluorophores. Graphic in panel (<b>D</b>) shows the number of detected single molecules (blue data, right axis) and the mean SNR of the single molecule signal (red data, left axis) as a function of 405 nm photoactivation photon flux per pulse (10 ms pulses every 1 s). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the molecules within the image depth of focus indeed increases as the total number of detected particles decreases. In panel (<b>E</b>), the trace of a single Dendra2 molecule freely diffusing in the nucleus of a living cell is depicted, imaged at a rate of 95 Hz (10 ms acquisition time and 0.5 ms interval between frames)."

The activation (405 nm) laser and the excitation (561 nm) laser were aligned on a single beam using a dichroic beam splitter. Their intensity and on/off switching ratio were independently controlled with an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF). The combined laser beam was expanded through a beam expander and focused on the rear plane of the objective in an inverted microscope, with the help of a long-pass dichroic. The emission from the sample was imaged through the tube lens with an EMCCD. Panel <b>B</b> shows the transition of a fast diffusing particle to a bound state. The image of the moving particle results in a motion blur whereas the image of the bound molecule is a well-defined PSF. In panel <b>C</b>, schematics of the steps followed by the detection algorithm for both a well-defined PSF and a motion blur. The initial image (i) was smoothed by a Gaussian mask and the threshold value set as the 80% percentile of the raw image (ii).

The position of the centroid of 29 consecutive detections represents the experimental error of the detection. Computation of the standard deviation of the mean along the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> axes is a measure of the pointing accuracy."

Therefore, we developed new localization and tracking algorithms (\u2018Materials and methods\u2014Detection and tracking of single molecules\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>) and validated them with simulations (\u2018Materials and methods\u2014Numerical simulations\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We could thus obtain single trajectories formed by individual translocations recorded every 10 ms. 50% of the traces were reconstructed with more than four time points, and some of them were as long as 60 consecutive translocations.

When a particle undergoes anomalous diffusion, the MSD vs time scales as a power law <i>t</i><sup><i>\u03b1</i></sup>, where \u03b1 &lt; 1 is characteristic of a subdiffusion process (<a href=\"#bib64\">Saxton, 2007</a>). However, neither the \u2018free\u2019 Dendra2 nor the c-Myc MSD data could be properly fit by such a law (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Similarly to \u2018free\u2019 Dendra2, c-Myc molecules were distributed between populations of very distinct diffusion coefficients. In contrast, for P-TEFb, the MSD variations were remarkably fit by a <i>t</i><sup><i>\u03b1</i></sup> power law with the anomalous coefficient \u03b1 = 0.6 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The subdiffusion of P-TEFb was also apparent when we plotted the cumulative histograms of the square displacement for multiples of the time interval (\u0394t) between two frames and rescaled them by the factor <i>t</i><sup><i>\u03b1</i></sup>, with \u03b1 determined from the fit in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>.

In other words, the subdiffusive behavior, evidenced by the sublinear MSD, is due to either temporal or spatial restrictions. In order to probe the spatial characteristics of the exploration independently of temporal considerations, we analyzed the distribution of angles \u0398 between two consecutive translocations, an observable that is predominantly sensitive to the geometry of the exploration space (<a href=\"#bib40\">Liao et al., 2012</a>) and able to elucidate complex dynamics of molecules (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burov et al., 2013</a>)."

In a three-dimensional space, there is no privileged direction and all angles \u0398 are equiprobable. In contrast, the angular distribution for P-TEFb was significantly biased toward 180\u00b0, reflecting an anti-correlation between two successive displacements. Such anisotropic angular distribution is consistent with diffusion in a space of reduced dimensionality such as a fractal network (<a href=\"#bib4\">ben-Avraham and Havlin, 2005</a>). A particle that diffuses in such a structure encounters dead ends, in which case it cannot but return back to previously visited locations (\u0398 = 180\u00b0). Noteworthy, the diffusing subpopulation of H2B molecules also showed a non-uniform angular distribution (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

If a diffusing particle is confined in a volume of size comparable to the translocation steps, its repetitive bouncing against the trap walls will produce a relative increase of angles larger than 90\u00b0. In such a case, the temporal evolution of the anti-persistence reflects the length ratio between the displacement steps and the size of the confining volume. On the other hand, a defining property of fractal structures is their scale invariance (<a href=\"#bib4\">ben-Avraham and Havlin, 2005</a>), namely the repetition of structural motifs at different length scales. For a particle diffusing in such a fractal structure, we expected the scale invariance to be apparent in the characteristics of the movement of the particle."

The AC is thus negative for angular distributions with a dominant number of backward angles, and it measures the deviation from a homogenous distribution. We calculated the AC for the angles formed at increasing lag times (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) as well as a function of the average length of the consecutive translocations forming the angle \u03b8 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is important to note that with this analysis, the experimental localization accuracy is reflected in the first data point of the spatial dependence of the AC, and not for the data above the 0\u2013150 nm bin.

However, the angular distribution became isotropic (AC = 0) at translocations larger than 300 nm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This transition can be interpreted as an indication of the upper limit size of the confining volume. Hence, the temporal and spatial evolution of the AC suggest two subpopulations of c-Myc, one confined into regions smaller than \u223c300 nm and a non-confined fraction of c-Myc molecules. P-TEFb, on the other hand, displayed a remarkable constant value of AC for both, time and space (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>), possibly reflecting a length-invariant property of the medium in which diffusion takes place."

We considered a 3D percolation cluster as well as a 2D Sierpinski carpet. The Sierpinski carpet is an exact fractal lattice with multi-scale self-similarities. Random walks on a Sierpinski lattice are anomalous because its structure induces spatial correlations between successive displacements. The percolation cluster at the critical percolation threshold possesses the property of statistical internal self-similarity. As a consequence, the percolation cluster exhibits fractal properties without a defined geometric shape (<a href=\"#bib4\">ben-Avraham and Havlin, 2005</a>). For both fractal structures, the angular anisotropy was constant with time (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), illustrating the scale-invariant features of fractal structures, as observed in the experimental data of P-TEFb. Surprisingly, the AC decreased for larger translocations in the case of the percolation cluster, while the Sierpinski carpet yielded an invariant asymmetry in space. This was interesting because it indicates that the underlying network needs to reproduce a certain degree of geometrical self-similarity, as it is the case of the Sierpinski carpet. The percolation cluster, on the other hand, does not conserve its geometry at different scales but rather other features like the local density obey a power law."

In the case of P-TEFb, our simulations support the notion that anomalous diffusion is compatible with an obstructed mobility of the proteins, as obtained on a fractal structure (we have ruled out other models of subdiffusion, see <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2014Numerical simulations of anomalous diffusion models\u2019 for a more detailed discussion). As previously described, the exponent \u03b1 = 0.6 of anomalous diffusion obtained for P-TEFb (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) is a direct measure of the dimension of the walk <i>D</i><sub><i>w</i></sub> = 2/\u03b1 = 3.3. Since the fractal dimension <i>D</i><sub><i>f</i></sub> has an upper limit at <i>D</i><sub><i>f</i></sub> = 3, we can therefore conclude that <i>D</i><sub><i>w</i></sub> &gt; <i>D</i><sub><i>f</i></sub>, and thus that P-TEFb is engaged in a <i>compact</i> exploration of the nucleoplasm. In contrast, the isotropic sampling of space of c-Myc excludes a <i>compact</i> mode of exploration; it undergoes normal 3D diffusion irrespective of its confinement, and hence the dimension of the walk is <i>D</i><sub><i>w</i></sub> = 2, sampling the nucleoplasm in a <i>non-compact</i> manner.

In contrast, the MFPT of P-TEFb increased with the distance <i>r</i> but did not depend on the target size. The lack of size dependence can be simply viewed as a consequence of the redundant exploration of <i>compact</i> explorers, and reflects the fact that the limiting step to find a target is the time taken to reach its vicinity. We stress that the differences of MFPT can be very significant. For instance, the time needed to find a 10 nm target located at a distance of 250 nm is 68 times longer for c-Myc compared to P-TEFb (506.1 s for c-Myc and 7.4 s for P-TEFb).

First, the exploration geometry of the nucleus by TFs is determined by the function and interactions of the nuclear factor. Rather than being subjected to a universal sampling geometry imposed by the nuclear architecture, c-Myc and P-TEFb adopt different modes of exploration leading to normal and anomalous diffusion, respectively. Second, despite apparently similar diffusion coefficients, the different exploration strategies of c-Myc and P-TEFb (<i>non-compact</i> and <i>compact</i>, respectively) can lead to opposite dependence of the search kinetics on the distance to the target and on the target size. The distance-dependence of the MFPT has direct implications on the probability of interaction of c-Myc and the P-TEFb with their respective partners, which in turn may affect transcriptional kinetics and regulation."

This finding was further supported by measurements of the distribution of angles between consecutive translocations. Importantly, this distribution was initially isotropic for Dendra2 and c-Myc and an asymmetry towards the return angles increased over time, as expected for confined Brownian motion. Conversely, P-TEFb showed a pronounced and time-invariant anisotropy consistent with the motion on a fractal structure. Thus, the nuclear geometry, or equivalently, the architecture of the space sampled by diffusing factors, is not unique but constitutes a protein-specific parameter. Furthermore, taking into consideration the diffusion parameters derived from the analysis of the MSD, together with the geometrical aspects of the exploration of c-Myc and P-TEFb, we determined the mode of exploration of these factors to be <i>non-compact</i> and <i>compact</i>, respectively."

For example, it has been recently shown that, in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, the spatial distribution of TFs is determined by the local state of DNA (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kuhlman and Cox, 2012</a>). Let us consider the case of TFs co-regulating multiple loci; the relative localization of these loci is an important parameter that will play different roles depending on the <i>compact</i> or <i>non-compact</i> exploration of the TFs. <i>Non-compact</i> TFs have a very similar probability to bind to all loci. In other words, all loci will have the same probability to be occupied, regardless of their spatial position. In contrast, <i>compact</i> factors will be preferentially shared between proximal loci, and therefore the probability of a locus to be occupied by a <i>compact</i> explorer is a function of the occupation history of its neighboring sites: it is distance and time dependent. Importantly, this indicates that two loci, such as two regulatory sites located a few tens of kbp away from each other, can transfer information and influence one another without direct physical contact. This spatial relation could underlie the process of sequestration of factors away from their targets (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yao et al., 2011</a>), which would occur only with <i>compact</i> explorers. Such geometrically controlled long-distance interactions are not detectable using conventional chromatin capture assays, which predominantly rely on the chemical crosslinking between contacting sites."

As a result, they have a probability equal to one to return to a site that they previously occupied, a property designated as the recurrence of <i>compact</i> trajectories. From a biochemical viewpoint, this property might affect our understanding of the kinetic stability of molecular complexes. Certainly, molecular machines controlling the nuclear functions such as transcription, splicing, and replication are composed of large numbers of molecules. Some of these molecules are stable constituents while others can be rapidly exchanged in order to control the specificity and modulate the activity of a particular complex (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fong et al., 2012</a>). It is therefore important to understand how these molecular machines can assemble from their principal components. For instance, we cannot yet reconcile the need for strong and stable interactions, believed to be required for the viability of such complexes, and the requisite of weak and transient interactions required for molecules to compete for the same target regulating their composition. The observation of <i>compact</i> modes suggests that strong binding, associated to small dissociation rates, is not required to ensure high occupancy."

In this model, for <i>compact</i> TFs, the recurrence of the trajectories and the facilitated re-association to the locus would result in transcriptional bursting.

Our current view of the nucleoplasm and chromatin is that of a structure whose condensation influences its accessibility to transacting factors.

If that is the case, it will be of paramount importance to understand the level of regulation of such transitions, as well as the implications for the kinetics of the transcription process. The inverse first passage time is a measure of the reaction rate constant. Therefore, the different interaction kinetics that results from <i>compact</i> or <i>non-compact</i> explorations has profound implications in the understanding of the dynamic interactions and reactivity rates between TFs and corresponding regulated genes. For a <i>non-compact</i> explorer like c-Myc, the interaction rate is that of a homogenous solution, and thus it will bind with equal probability to any target in the nucleoplasmic volume. On the other hand, for a <i>compact</i> exploration such as the one of P-TEFb, the recurrent search of the local environment and the distance dependence of the search time translate into spatial and temporal correlations between binding events. Such spatial correlation can be seen as a mechanism that adds a level of control to the rapid assembly of molecular complexes, reconciling weak and transient interactions with functional stability. This last notion suggests the idea of a regulated level of compactness of TFs both in time and space."

This implies that the detected molecules can travel a distance larger than the diffraction limit of light (\u223c250 nm) during the characteristic acquisition time (10 ms). The intensity profile is therefore a convolution between the Airy pattern of the point spread function (PSF) and the trajectory of the particle during the 10 ms acquisition time (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). While such motion blur contains potentially useful information (<a href=\"#bib20\">Elf et al., 2007</a>), it has some detrimental consequences: a decrease of the SNR and the ineffectiveness of traditional Gaussian fit localization algorithms. An approach, demonstrated in bacteria, to minimize the blurring effect consists in illuminating the sample with brief (1 ms or less) and intense (up to 100 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>) laser pulses (<a href=\"#bib20\">Elf et al., 2007</a>). In bacteria, this stroboscopic method is all the more necessary since the extension of the motion blur is often comparable to the size of the cell itself (section of 1 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>). However, given the larger dimension (section \u223c200 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>) of a mammalian nucleus, this method requires high laser power, not practical with standard microscopes or live cell microscopy due to phototoxicity effects. Hence, we favored an approach using lower intensity (\u223c4 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>) and longer illumination time (\u223c10 ms), limited by the readout rate of our camera. At this time scale, trajectories are not affected by the nuclear confinement."

Individual pixel aggregates were then selected for each frame, with one additional constraint to account for molecules diffusing outside and back inside the focal plane during the acquisition time; we considered detected spots closer than 500 nm as originating from the same molecule. The position of each spot was calculated as the center of mass of the pixel aggregate, which is a good estimator of the particle position suggested by deconvolution approaches (<a href=\"#bib51\">Michalet, 2010</a>)."

In order to do so, we determined the local particle density at a time point where the probability of detecting the same particle is close to zero. We estimated the fluorescence photobleaching characteristic time under our experimental conditions by measuring the fluorescence lifetime of an ensemble of proteins in the nucleus, after a high intensity activation pulse, and under usual imaging conditions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We measured a fluorescence half-life of \u223c600 ms, suggesting that the probability of a molecule photobleaching between two consecutive frames is 0.02. After 5 s (476 frames) of the initial detection, it is highly improbable (0.0001 probability) that a detection originates from the same molecule. For each molecule detected, we could therefore calculate the number of detections around the same spatial coordinates but at a time separation of 5 s or more and thus estimate the average local density within a radius <i>R</i> of the molecule."

For that reason, the fractal model has been applied to the comprehension of random walks on disordered media (<a href=\"#bib71\">Szymanski and Weiss, 2009</a>). Fractal object involves the repetition of the same features of an object at different scales. If the whole object is repeated then the fractal is exact. One example of exact fractal is the Sierpinski gasket, a 2D-embedded fractal lattice of dimension df = log(8)/log(3) \u2248 1.89. An example of a non-exact fractal is the maximum site percolation cluster at percolation threshold. The geometry is not conserved in the cluster at different scales, but rather features such as the local density obey a power law."

The angular distribution was obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of 10,000 realizations of trajectories of 500 steps with a randomly distributed start. Since the initial mesh was a cube, there were privileged directions with higher number of sites and thus a higher number of possible successive positions. In computations of the angular distributions on such simulated trajectories, this results in an over representation of the directions imposed by the lattice geometry such a 90\u00b0angle that vanished with an increasing time lag. This bias would be negligible if the percolation cluster had a large number of sites, such that allowed us to record the position of the trajectory for at time lag significantly larger than 2000 steps. The limitation to perform such a simulation was the random access memory of the computer. We therefore applied a simple correction to the angular distribution of the simulated trajectories. We recorded all the possible translocations from our simulations for time lags 1\u0394t to 10\u0394t. These translocations were then shuffled to compute the distribution of the angles that was inherent to the network itself and not to the successive displacement correlation. Such \u2018structural distribution\u2019 reflected therefore the anisotropy of the structure due to the finite scale of the computations, and we used it as a normalization distribution. We verified that this \u2018structural\u2019 angular distribution flattened at increasing time lag. The angular distributions shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> were therefore rescaled by dividing each bin proportion by the corresponding one in the structural distribution."

While bound to the targets, P-TEFb continues diffusing either with them, but much slower due to their size, or on the surface/volume of immobile targets (e.g. hopping between CTD domains of Pol II). Thus P-TEFb alternates between rounds of fast free (normal) diffusion and periods of slow and possibly confined diffusion. My hypothesis is that such motion can leads to MSD vs t and angular distributions of steps that appearas anomalous diffusion, even when the dwell time is exponentially distributed (not power-law-CTRW). Moreover, heavy-tailed dwell times can lead to real subdiffusion (CTRW type) with inhomogeneous angular distributions due to trapping."

Authors further suggest that a matrix of Pol II-CTD repeats can lead to anomalous diffusion. This is a conceptually important point: a mesh of traps can lead to slow diffusion, diffusion with intermittent binding, but anomalous diffusion would further require such mesh of Pol II-CTDs to form a perfect fractal. Note that anomalous diffusion can be observed on the percolation cluster only right at the percolation threshold. Near-fractal clusters below or above the percolation point do not lead to anomalous diffusion. It is hard to imagine Pol II forming such perfect structures. Excellent recent data on Pol II localization (from the same group) would hardly support this notion."

Thus P-TEFb alternates between rounds of fast free (normal) diffusion and periods of slow and possibly confined diffusion. My hypothesis is that such motion can leads to MSD vs t and angular distributions of steps that appearas anomalous diffusion, even when the dwell time is exponentially distributed (not power-law-CTRW).

This was interesting because it indicates that the underlying network needs to reproduce a certain degree of geometrical self-similarity, as it is the case of the Sierpinski carpet.

Authors further suggest that a matrix of Pol II-CTD repeats can lead to anomalous diffusion. This is a conceptually important point: a mesh of traps can lead to slow diffusion, diffusion with intermittent binding, but anomalous diffusion would further require such mesh of Pol II-CTDs to form a perfect fractal. Note that anomalous diffusion can be observed on the percolation cluster only right at the percolation threshold. Near-fractal clusters below or above the percolation point do not lead to anomalous diffusion. It is hard to imagine Pol II forming such perfect structures.
