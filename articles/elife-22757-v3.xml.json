                    "text": "The unique anatomical and functional features of principal and interneuron populations are critical for the appropriate function of neuronal circuits. Cell type-specific properties are encoded by selective gene expression programs that shape molecular repertoires and synaptic protein complexes. However, the nature of such programs, particularly for post-transcriptional regulation at the level of alternative splicing is only beginning to emerge. We here demonstrate that transcripts encoding the synaptic adhesion molecules neurexin-1,2,3 are commonly expressed in principal cells and interneurons of the mouse hippocampus but undergo highly differential, cell type-specific alternative splicing. Principal cell-specific neurexin splice isoforms depend on the RNA-binding protein Slm2. By contrast, most parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons lack Slm2, express a different neurexin splice isoform and co-express the corresponding splice isoform-specific neurexin ligand Cbln4. Conditional ablation of <i>Nrxn</i> alternative splice insertions selectively in PV<sup>+</sup> cells results in elevated hippocampal network activity and impairment in a learning task. Thus, PV-cell-specific alternative splicing of neurexins is critical for neuronal circuit function"

Cell type-specific properties are encoded by selective gene expression programs that shape molecular repertoires and synaptic protein complexes. However, the nature of such programs, particularly for post-transcriptional regulation at the level of alternative splicing is only beginning to emerge. We here demonstrate that transcripts encoding the synaptic adhesion molecules neurexin-1,2,3 are commonly expressed in principal cells and interneurons of the mouse hippocampus but undergo highly differential, cell type-specific alternative splicing. Principal cell-specific neurexin splice isoforms depend on the RNA-binding protein Slm2. By contrast, most parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons lack Slm2, express a different neurexin splice isoform and co-express the corresponding splice isoform-specific neurexin ligand Cbln4. Conditional ablation of <i>Nrxn</i> alternative splice insertions selectively in PV<sup>+</sup> cells results in elevated hippocampal network activity and impairment in a learning task. Thus, PV-cell-specific alternative splicing of neurexins is critical for neuronal circuit function"

This indicated that at least some neurexin isoforms are enriched in a cell type-specific manner. Pairwise comparisons of relative transcript levels recovered from single cells suggested that individual cells within one cell type might exhibit more similar alternative exon usage than cells from divergent origins (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fuccillo et al., 2015</a>).

We uncovered similar usage of alternative exons at AS3 across all preparations. Interestingly, <i>Nrxn1 AS6</i> and <i>Nrxn2 AS2</i> exhibited differential usage in PV\u2212 versus CamK2 cells. Moreover, for all three <i>Nrxn</i> transcripts (<i>Nrxn1,2,3</i>) the alternative exon incorporation rates at AS4 were remarkably divergent between the two cell populations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

                                "text": "Neurexin alternative splicing at AS4 is regulated by the STAR-family of RNA-binding proteins, in particular the protein Slm2 which regulates skipping of the alternative exon (<a href=\"#bib20\">Iijima et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ehrmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Iijima et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Traunm\u00fcller et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2016</a>). Thus, we tested whether cell type-specific alternative splicing at AS4 may be a consequence of differential expression of Slm2 in pyramidal versus PV<sup>+</sup> cells that are targeted in the <i>CamK2<sup>cre</sup></i> and <i>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup></i> transgenic lines, respectively. As reported previously (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stoss et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Iijima et al., 2014</a>), we observed high expression of Slm2 protein in pyramidal cells, and more than 90% of CamK2<sup>Ribo</sup>-positive cells were Slm2-positive (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). By contrast, 75% of cells marked in <i>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup>::</i>Ai9<sup>Tom</sup> mice in hippocampus area CA1 do not express Slm2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In particular, cells within or close to the pyramidal cell layer were Slm2-negative (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and E</a> - note that the percentage of Slm2-expressing \u2018PV<sup>+</sup> cells\u2019 depends on the anatomical position within the hippocampus and the use of genetic versus antibody-labeling to define \u2018PV<sup>+</sup> cells\u2019, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D and E</a>). We further explored differential expression of STAR-family RNA binding proteins by real-time qPCR on polysome-associated transcripts from CamK2<sup>Ribo</sup> and PV<sup>Ribo</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Consistent with the immunohistochemistry results, we observed an enrichment of <i>Slm2</i> transcripts in the CamK2<sup>Ribo</sup> population and a de-enrichment in the PV<sup>Ribo</sup> preparations (similarly the <i>Slm2</i> paralogues <i>Slm1</i> and <i>Sam68</i> were de-enriched). Given that global ablation of Slm2 results in a significant loss of the skipped (AS4-) neurexin isoforms (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ehrmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Traunm\u00fcller et al., 2014</a>), this strongly suggests that differential expression of Slm2 in pyramidal versus PV<sup>+</sup> cells drives the cell type-specific skipping of alternative exons at AS4 in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. Finally, we observed that ectopic expression of Slm2 in cells that normally do not express high levels of STAR proteins (cerebellar granule cells in culture) was sufficient to shift alternative splicing in favor of <i>Nrxn AS4-</i> isoforms (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

                                "text": "Neurexin AS4+ and AS4- isoforms differ in biochemical interactions with several synaptic ligands. In particular, AS4+ isoforms bind to a class of extracellular ligands called cerebellins (Cbln1-4) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Uemura et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ito-Ishida et al., 2012</a>). We hypothesized that neurexin alternative splicing and Cbln expression might coincide. We detected an enrichment of <i>Cbln4</i>-encoding transcripts in the PV<sup>+</sup> cell population (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). By contrast, the CamK2<sup>Ribo</sup> population was de-enriched for both, <i>Cbln2</i> and <i>Cbln4</i> transcripts (note that <i>Cbln1</i> and <i>Cbln3</i> show very low expression in the mouse hippocampus as compared to the cerebellum, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Thus, pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus express high levels of Slm2 which drives production of AS4- splice isoforms, and there are low levels of Cbln2 and 4. Conversely, the PV<sup>+</sup> cell population largely lacks STAR-family RNA-binding proteins (Sam68, Slm1, Slm2), exhibit high levels of alternative exon inclusion at AS4, and the cells co-express Cbln4. Despite the similarities between Cbln1,2, and 4 it has remained unclear to what extent Cbln4 interacts with Nrx AS4+ proteins. In fact, binding to Nrx3 AS4+ isoforms has been reported to be low or not detectable (<a href=\"#bib22\">Joo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Matsuda and Yuzaki, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wei et al., 2012</a>). Using in vitro binding assays with Cbln4 from conditioned media we confirmed binding to cells expressing Nrx1\u03b1 AS4+ but significantly lower binding to Nrx3 AS4+ isoforms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>). We then tested another assay configuration where Cbln proteins and Nrx isoforms are co-expressed in the same cell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In this assay, Cbln1 or 4 were strongly retained at the cell surface of cells co-expressing Cbln1 or Cbln4 together with Nrx3 AS4+ isoforms but not Nrx3 AS4- (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F and G</a>). Thus, Cbln4 indeed associates not only with Nrx1\u03b1 but also Nrx3\u03b1 proteins in a AS4 splice-isoform-specific manner (further studies will be required to confirm whether these interactions are direct or whether they may involve additional linker proteins)."

However, the majority of neurexin proteins in vivo are alpha isoforms (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schreiner et al., 2015</a>) and the impact of AS4+ insertions on the synaptogenic activity of alpha neurexins has not been examined. Thus, we tested whether the presence or absence of AS4 insertions might modify the synaptogenic activity of Nrx\u03b1 proteins. Inclusion of the 30 amino acid AS4+ insertion elevated the action of Nrx3\u03b1 proteins towards GABAergic postsynaptic sites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H and I</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>.

First, we demonstrate that alpha neurexin transcripts are commonly expressed in pyramidal cells as well as PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons. We then show that alternative splicing at the alternatively spliced segment four (AS4) is a major driver for the generation of divergent neurexin isoforms in PV<sup>+</sup> cells and pyramidal cells. Differential alternative splicing emerges from differential expression of the RNA-binding protein Slm2 that drives selective production of AS4- splice isoforms in pyramidal cells. By contrast, Slm2 is absent from the majority of PV<sup>+</sup> cells which produce AS4+ isoforms and co-express the splice isoform-specific ligand Cbln4. Finally, we provide evidence that selective disruption of the PV<sup>+</sup> cell-associated AS4+ isoforms results in increased hippocampal network activity and impairs short-term memory, demonstrating that the cell type-specific alternative splice variants are indeed relevant for circuit function."

We note that the estimates of exon incorporation rates based on extrapolation from several independent qPCR assays can make it difficult to reliably assess isoform contents due to differential primer efficiencies. The high abundance of AS4+ isoforms in the hippocampus reported in the present study is supported by radioactive and semi-quantitative PCR assays, as well as previous mass-spectrometric assays that probe Nrx3 AS4+ variants on the protein level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and [<a href=\"#bib8\">Ehrmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Traunm\u00fcller et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Schreiner et al., 2015</a>]).

The high expression of <i>Nrxn1,2,3 AS4-</i> variants in pyramidal cells discovered here correlates with the high expression of Slm2 protein in pyramidal cells and the near complete loss of these variants in Slm2 knock-out mice (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ehrmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Traunm\u00fcller et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, we demonstrate that Slm2 is absent from the majority of hippocampal CA1 interneurons marked in the <i>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup>::</i>Ai9<sup>Tom</sup> mouse line. Correspondingly, these cells generate high levels of AS4+ neurexin isoforms. It remains to be tested whether the absence of STAR-family RNA binding proteins is sufficient to direct alternative splicing to the inclusion of AS4+ or whether other, yet unidentified alternative splicing factors contribute to this alternative splicing choice. Finally, we demonstrate that this selective expression of AS4+ variants coincides with PV<sup>+</sup> cell enrichment of Cbln4, an AS4+ specific neurexin ligand. Interestingly, the differential expression of AS4 isoforms in PV <i>versus</i> principal cells is also in part observed for cortical cell populations (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In additional RiboTrap purifications from somatostatin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus we also observed an enrichment of <i>Nrxn AS4+</i> isoforms as compared to principal cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>) along with Slm2-negative somatostatin-expressing cells in the hippocampus (in particular in the hilus, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Thus, our study uncovers a hippocampal interneuron-specific gene expression program that consists of neurexin isoforms and ligands in the hippocampus."

In the mouse cerebellum, Neurexin-Cbln1 interactions have been demonstrated to be essential for the formation and stability of granule cell-Purkinje cell synapses (<a href=\"#bib50\">Uemura et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ito-Ishida et al., 2012</a>). Similar to granule cells, PV<sup>+</sup> cells in the hippocampus express a Cbln family protein (Cbln4) and neurexin AS4+ isoforms which interact with Cblns. However, genetic disruption of <i>Nrxn1 and 3</i> AS4 insertions did not result in morphological alterations of PV<sup>+</sup> cell output synapses detectable at the level of light or electron microscopy. Structural functions of a Nrx1/3-Cbln4 pair, analogous to the cerebellar system, may be compensated by the remaining Nrx2 AS4+ isoforms or conditional ablation of the AS4 insertions with the <i>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup></i> line may not be complete when PV<sup>+</sup> cell synapses form during postnatal development. Alternatively, the essential roles for Nrx1/3-Cbln4 complexes in PV<sup>+</sup> cells may differ from what is observed for Nrx-Cbln1 complexes in the cerebellum. Regardless, the increased c-fos<sup>+</sup> expression in the hippocampus of <i>Nrxn1/3<sup>ex21\u0394PV</sup></i> mice indicates that the AS4+ isoforms have important functions and presumably reflects an impairment in PV<sup>+</sup> cell mediated inhibition in hippocampal circuits. Moreover, the impairment of short-term memory further supports the notion that neurexin AS4+ isoforms have important functions in the cells targeted by the <i>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup></i> line in the hippocampus. Dysfunction of PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron networks has been postulated to be a major contributor to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and autism (<a href=\"#bib7\">Del Pino et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gogolla et al., 2014</a>). Thus, we speculate that part of the neuronal circuit deficits resulting from <i>Nrxn1 and 3</i> mutations in disease states may directly impair output synapses of the PV-interneuron network."

The mice carry loxP sites on either side of exon 21 of the <i>Nrxn3</i> gene. A targeting vector was designed with a loxP site placed 718 bp upstream of exon 21 of mouse <i>Nrxn3</i> and a loxP-Frt-PGKneo-Frt cassette inserted 840 bp downstream of the same exon. The 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 homology arms were approximately 5 kb and 3 kb in length, respectively, and the targeting construct contained herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase as negative selectable marker in the 3' arm of the targeting vector. The construct was electroporated into ES cells derived from F1(129Sv/B6) embryos. Correctly targeted ES cells were then used to generate chimeric mice. Male chimera were mated with ROSA26-Flpe females (Jax stock no: 003946), which had been backcrossed over five generations with C57Bl6J, to remove the PGKneo cassette. The resulting heterozygotes were intercrossed to produce homozygotes.

The lysate was centrifuged at 2\u2019000xg for 10 min. Igepal-CA380 was then added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1%. After 5 min incubation on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 12\u2019000xg for 10 min. Anti-HA coupled magnetic beads (Pierce) were added to the supernatant in the following concentrations: 25 \u00b5L/mL for CamK2<sup>Ribo</sup> and 15 \u00b5L/mL of beads for PV<sup>Ribo</sup> samples, respectively. Incubation was performed at 4\u00b0C for 4 hr.

The link between PV neuron-specific <i>Nrxn</i> splicing, absence of obvious synaptic abnormalities in PV synaptic boutons and the observed behavioral impairments is not clear and raises questions. Are PV neurons known to play a role in the behavioral task assayed? Does this task also rely on PV micro-circuits outside the hippocampus and do PV neurons in those circuits also display enriched expression of AS4+? In other words, is the preferential use of AS4+ in PV cells a global phenomenon or might it be brain region-specific? A further exploration of synaptic defects in PV neurons might help to bridge the current gap between PV-specific <i>Nrxn</i> isoform repertoires and behavioral defects. In addition to analyzing spontaneous synaptic transmission, the authors could analyze evoked inhibitory responses and look at plasticity of PV-pyramidal neuron synapses. This would strengthen the impact of their findings. I understand the current focus is on PV synaptic terminals, but the authors could also explore whether excitatory inputs onto PV neurons might be affected in <i>Nrxn1</i>/3<i><sup>ex21</sup></i>Pv mice."

Here, Nguyen et al. continue this analysis, focusing on differences in \u03b1-neurexin splicing between inhibitory (PV<sup>+</sup>) and pyramidal (CamK2<sup>+</sup>) neurons in hippocampus. Using state-of-the-art methods, including RiboTrap purification of RNA from genetically identified cell types and quantitative analysis of exon usage, they show high inclusion rate of AS4 in neurexins in inhibitory relative to pyramidal neurons. Their previous work had shown that the STAR family member Slm2 leads to AS4 exclusion, and sure enough, PV<sup>+</sup> cells have lower levels of Slm2 than pyramids. They then go on to assess the consequences of AS4 inclusion/exclusion in two ways. First they confirm and extend previous work showing that AS4 affects the relative activity of neurexins on inhibitory and excitatory synaptogenesis, as well as its binding to cerebellins. Second, they show that selective deletion of the AS4 exon from neurexins 1 and 3 in PV-expressing cells degrades performance of mice in an object recognition task, which is generally interpreted as indicating impairment in short-term memory."
