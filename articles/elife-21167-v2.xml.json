However, during starvation-induced stress, COPII vesicles have been implicated as a membrane source for autophagosomes, distinct organelles that engulf cellular components for degradation by macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy). How cells regulate core trafficking machinery to fulfill dramatically different cellular roles in response to environmental cues is unknown. Here we show that phosphorylation of conserved amino acids on the membrane-distal surface of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> COPII cargo adaptor, Sec24, reprograms COPII vesicles for autophagy. We also show casein kinase 1 (Hrr25) is a key kinase that phosphorylates this regulatory surface. During autophagy, Sec24 phosphorylation regulates autophagosome number and its interaction with the C-terminus of Atg9, a component of the autophagy machinery required for autophagosome initiation. We propose that the acute need to produce autophagosomes during starvation drives the interaction of Sec24 with Atg9 to increase autophagosome abundance."

However, during starvation-induced stress, COPII vesicles have been implicated as a membrane source for autophagosomes, distinct organelles that engulf cellular components for degradation by macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy). How cells regulate core trafficking machinery to fulfill dramatically different cellular roles in response to environmental cues is unknown. Here we show that phosphorylation of conserved amino acids on the membrane-distal surface of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> COPII cargo adaptor, Sec24, reprograms COPII vesicles for autophagy. We also show casein kinase 1 (Hrr25) is a key kinase that phosphorylates this regulatory surface. During autophagy, Sec24 phosphorylation regulates autophagosome number and its interaction with the C-terminus of Atg9, a component of the autophagy machinery required for autophagosome initiation. We propose that the acute need to produce autophagosomes during starvation drives the interaction of Sec24 with Atg9 to increase autophagosome abundance."

Davis et al. observed that Sec24 could be modified by the attachment of phosphate groups at a distinct site on the surface of Sec24. This modification promotes Sec24 to interact with Atg9 and increases the number of autophagosomes that form when cells are starving. Davis et al. also found that the enzyme casein kinase 1 is one of the enzymes responsible for attaching phosphate groups to Sec24."

Basal levels of autophagy continuously replenish the cellular pool of amino acids and other metabolites to maintain homeostasis. However, when cells are starved for nutrients, autophagy is quickly upregulated. This upregulation leads to a dramatic intracellular reorganization to meet the high demand for membrane required to form autophagosomes, distinct organelles that target cellular components for degradation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</a>). Induction of autophagy leads to the formation of a double-membrane structure, called the isolation membrane, that forms adjacent to a pre-autophagosome structure (PAS) where autophagy related proteins (Atg) are recruited in a hierarchical manner (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</a>). As the isolation membrane expands, it engulfs cytoplasmic proteins and organelles targeted for degradation before it seals to form an autophagosome. The autophagosome then fuses with the vacuole/lysosome, releasing its contents for degradation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lamb et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</a>). Although the assembly pathway of the Atg proteins is known, the mechanism by which membranes are directed to the autophagy pathway remains a central unanswered question in the field."

How COPII vesicles, which are faithfully targeted to the Golgi, can be reprogrammed to function on an alternate trafficking pathway during nutrient deprivation remains enigmatic. COPII coated vesicle formation is initiated at the ER with the recruitment of an inner coat layer comprising the Sec23/Sec24 complex. Coat polymerization and vesicle budding occur when Sec23/Sec24 recruits a second complex (Sec13/Sec31) that forms the outer shell of the coat. Sec24, the major cargo adaptor of the COPII coat, recruits biosynthetic cargo and SNAREs (which mediate vesicle fusion) into vesicles that are delivered to the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lord et al., 2013</a>). After vesicle fission, the coat lingers on the vesicle to facilitate vesicle targeting to the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lord et al., 2011</a>). COPII vesicle budding mutants, as well as other mutants that disrupt ER-Golgi traffic, also disrupt autophagy (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hamasaki et al., 2003</a>). However, a direct functional link between COPII vesicles, the COPII coat and autophagy has been difficult to demonstrate."

Previously, we showed coat phosphorylation is required for COPII vesicle fusion (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lord et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). Given the recently identified role of COPII vesicles in autophagosome formation, and the observation that Hrr25 is required for autophagy, we asked if coat phosphorylation also functions to regulate vesicle traffic during autophagy. Here we find that phosphorylation of the membrane distal surface of Sec24 promotes the interaction of Sec24 with the C-terminus of Atg9, which is needed for autophagy. Failure to phosphorylate this Sec24 site leads to a decrease in autophagosome number, but not autophagosome expansion. This phosphorylation event is independent of the assembly of the Atg machinery at the PAS. Together these studies reveal a surprising role for coat phosphorylation in reprogramming core trafficking machinery to fulfill a separate function during starvation induced stress."

COPII vesicles formed in vitro with Sec24-S730A/S735A showed normal capture of Sed5 and other cargo, whereas those formed with Sec24-S730D/S735D contained reduced amounts of Sed5 and were modestly impaired in their fusion efficiency with the Golgi (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Additionally, a strain harboring the Sec24-S730D/S735D mutations had reduced autophagic activity, whereas the Sec24-S730A/S735A mutation had no effect (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). Because the Sec24-S730D/S735D mutations had effects on both ER-Golgi traffic and autophagy, these sites are unlikely to specify the pathway the vesicle takes and instead highlight the importance of Sed5 packaging into COPII vesicles in both pathways. A second set of conserved phosphosites, S645/S678, located near a known cargo binding site in mammalian Sec24 (mSec24) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), did not disrupt the packaging of any cargo tested (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The effects of mutations in these sites on autophagy were monitored in a <i>sec24\u0394iss1\u0394</i> double mutant background by assaying Pho8\u039460 activity. Pho8\u039460 is a cytosolic form of vacuolar alkaline phosphatase that is delivered to and activated in the vacuole when autophagy is induced (<a href=\"#bib21\">Klionsky, 2007</a>). Only combinations of T324A, T325A and T328A were defective in autophagy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, red box). These three sites form a patch located on the membrane distal surface of Sec24 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), making them unlikely to regulate cargo packaging.

We were unable to test the full range of phosphomimetic combinations, as some caused lethality (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). However, none of the viable phosphomimetic mutants showed a defect in autophagy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Sec24-T324A/T325A/T328A (hereafter referred to as Sec24-3A) was further characterized because it had the most dramatic defect in Pho8\u039460 activity. To confirm that phosphorylation of the Sec24 membrane distal surface is required for autophagy, we examined a second autophagy marker, Atg8. Cytosolic GFP-Atg8 is lipidated and incorporated into membrane at the PAS before being delivered to the vacuole (<a href=\"#bib22\">Klionsky et al., 2007</a>). Translocation of GFP-Atg8 to the vacuole, following nitrogen starvation, was significantly reduced in a strain expressing Sec24-3A (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This defect was confirmed using western blot analysis by monitoring the cleavage of GFP-Atg8 to GFP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The GFP-Atg8 translocation defect was less severe in the presence of Iss1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, right), suggesting functional complementation by the paralogous protein."

To begin to address this question, structured illumination microscopy (SIM) was used to examine GFP-Atg8 puncta formation in the absence (nutrient rich) or presence of rapamycin. GFP-Atg8 puncta mark autophagosomes, as well as the PAS and isolation membrane (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kirisako et al., 1999</a>). In nutrient-rich media, autophagosome-like structures, called Cvt vesicles, form. These vesicles traffic a precursor form of aminopeptidase I (prApe1) to the vacuole in an Atg11-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib16\">He et al., 2006</a>), where it is proteolytically activated (mApe1). GFP-Atg8 puncta were smaller (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), less numerous, and dependent on Atg11 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) in nutrient rich medium. Consistent with the possibility that the GFP-Atg8 puncta may represent Cvt vesicles, Atg11 was only required for their formation in rich medium and not in rapamycin-treated cells (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>)."

When autophagy is induced, Atg9 vesicles traffic from the late Golgi to the PAS and localize adjacent to the ER exit sites that produce COPII vesicles (<a href=\"#bib12\">Graef et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Suzuki et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yamamoto et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, similar to our observations with Sec24, Atg9 was recently shown to regulate autophagosome number, but not size (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jin et al., 2014</a>). Proteomics also revealed an interaction between multiple COPII coat subunits and Atg9 in detergent lysates (<a href=\"#bib12\">Graef et al., 2013</a>). However, it remained unclear from these studies which coat subunit mediated this interaction and whether it was required for autophagy. Therefore, we first confirmed that Sec24 co-precipitates with Atg9 and tested whether this interaction is regulated by starvation. Sec24 was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing Atg9-13myc that were grown in nutrient rich conditions (SMD) or starved for nitrogen (SD-N), and the precipitate was then blotted with anti-myc antibody. Atg9-13myc co-immunoprecipitated with Sec24, but not the pre-immune control (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Moreover, approximately 2.5-fold more Atg9-13myc co-immunoprecipitated with Sec24 from lysates prepared from nitrogen starved cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), demonstrating that this interaction is upregulated during starvation."

While the middle and C-terminal domains are present in mammalian cells, the N-terminus is largely absent (<a href=\"#bib48\">Young et al., 2006</a>). In order to determine which domain of Atg9 interacts with Sec24, the cytoplasmic domains of Atg9 were fused to GST and the purified fusion proteins were incubated in vitro with purified Sec23/Sec24 complex. The Sec23/Sec24 complex was used for these studies, since Sec24-His<sub>6</sub> is unstable in the absence of Sec23. Sec24 was predominantly unphosphorylated, as it was purified without phosphatase inhibitors and stored in the freezer following purification. A GST fusion to a Sec31 fragment (aa878-1114), which was previously shown to interact with the Sec23/Sec24 complex (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bi et al., 2007</a>), served as a positive control. The C-terminus of Atg9 bound to Sec23/Sec24, while the N-terminal and middle hydrophilic Atg9 domains did not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, binding of Sec23/Sec24 to the C-terminus increased with increasing concentrations of the Sec23/Sec24 complex and appeared to be saturable (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This interaction was also dependent on Sec24, as Sec23 alone did not interact with GST-Atg9C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). As the crystal structure of Sec23 and Sec24 are identical whether they are in a complex or not, allosteric effects are unlikely (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bi et al., 2002</a>)."

While the most dramatic effects on autophagy were seen with the <i>sec24</i> triple alanine mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), the <i>sec24</i> triple phosphomimetic mutant is inviable. Therefore, to cover all three phosphosites of interest in our binding studies, we used Sec23/Sec24-T325E and Sec23/Sec24-T324E/T328E. Consistent with the notion that phosphorylation enhances the Sec24-Atg9 interaction, both T325E and T324E/T328E increased the interaction of Sec24 with GST-Atg9C (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

This defect was more pronounced in Sec24-3A, where Sec24-T328 is also mutated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Sec24-3A did not impair the trafficking of Atg9 to the PAS (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A,C</a>), indicating that Sec24 does not regulate Atg9 traffic.

To ask if Sec24-3A disrupts the formation of ERES, the localization of Sec13-GFP was examined in cells expressing wild-type Sec24 or Sec24-3A. Sec13-GFP, a component of the outer COPII coat, predominantly localizes to ERES (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shindiapina and Barlowe, 2010</a>). ERES localization of Sec13-GFP was not affected by Sec24-3A in nutrient rich or starvation conditions, suggesting Sec24-3A does not disrupt ERES formation (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, our findings imply that the major function of the Sec24 membrane distal surface is to regulate the interaction of COPII vesicles with the Atg machinery."

Recent studies, however, have suggested Hrr25 has an additional role in autophagy, upstream of COPII vesicle fusion at the PAS (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). Specifically, we found that while COPII vesicles accumulate at the PAS in some mutants that disrupt autophagy, they failed to accumulate in the <i>hrr25-5</i> mutant. Additionally, epistasis studies revealed Hrr25 acts upstream of the key autophagy kinase, Atg1 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2015</a>)."

Consistent with a role for Hrr25 in phosphorylating the Sec24 membrane distal patch, less Atg9 co-immunoprecipitated with Sec24 from an <i>hrr25-5</i> mutant lysate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Additionally, like the <i>sec24</i> triple mutant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F,G</a>), we observed a reduction in autophagic body number, but not size in the <i>hrr25-5</i> mutant using transmission electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). To determine if Hrr25 regulates the Sec24-Atg9 interaction via Sec24 phosphorylation, we asked whether the Sec24 phosphomimetic mutations could rescue the Sec24-Atg9 interaction defect in <i>hrr25</i>-5. Sec24 T325/T328 was chosen for this analysis as it contains T328, which is phosphorylated by Hrr25. WT Sec24, Sec24 T325A/T328A or Sec24 T325E/T328E was ectopically expressed in <i>hrr25-5</i> cells containing Atg9-13myc and Sec24 was immunoprecipitated. Sec24 T325E/T328E significantly rescued the Sec24-Atg9 interaction in <i>hrr25-5</i>, whereas Sec24 T325A/T328A did not (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Additionally, Sec24 T325E/T328E alleviated the autophagy defect in <i>hrr25-5</i> as the vacuolar localization of GFP-Atg8 induced by starvation was partially rescued by Sec24 T325E/T328E, but not Sec24 T325A/T328A (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). To confirm the fluorescence results, cleavage of GFP-Atg8 was also examined. Sec24 T325E/T328E almost fully rescued the GFP cleavage defect in <i>hrr25-5</i>, while Sec24 T325A/T328A had no effect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, although Hrr25 is required for COPII vesicle fusion (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lord et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2015</a>), phosphorylation of Sec24 is a primary function of this kinase during starvation induced autophagy. These findings also indicate the Sec24-Atg9 interaction is needed for autophagy."

However, as CK1 kinases act preferentially on substrates that are already phosphorylated at the N-3 position (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Knippschild et al., 2005</a>), during autophagy Hrr25 may work with other kinases that create additional Sec24 phosphosites. To determine if Hrr25 mediated phosphorylation of Sec24 is required for Atg complex assembly (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), we visualized the PAS recruitment of a member of each of the major groups of Atg proteins required for autophagosome formation in the <i>hrr25-5</i> and <i>sec24</i> triple alanine mutants. We found no effect of <i>hrr25-5</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) or Sec24-3A (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A,C</a>) on the PAS recruitment of Atg2, Atg5, Atg9, Atg13 or Atg14.

Thus, while COPII vesicles are needed for autophagy, they are dispensable for the assembly of the Atg hierarchy. Together these findings demonstrate that Sec24 phosphorylation does not indirectly affect autophagy by disrupting the trafficking of Atg proteins to the PAS."

Here we show that phosphorylation of a conserved regulatory domain of the major COPII cargo adaptor Sec24 reprograms the function of COPII vesicles by modulating its interaction with the C-terminus of Atg9, a key component of the autophagy machinery. The C-terminus of Atg9 is present in vertebrates and is essential for autophagy (<a href=\"#bib15\">He et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Young et al., 2006</a>). Atg9 functions early in autophagosome initiation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Suzuki et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yamamoto et al., 2012</a>) and affects autophagosome number, but not size (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jin et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, failure to phosphorylate the Sec24 regulatory sites, which disrupts the Sec24-Atg9 interaction, specifically affects autophagosome number. Consistent with our proposal that autophagosome formation requires the fusion of COPII vesicles with Atg9 vesicles (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), we see an accumulation of COPII coated structures at the PAS in the <i>atg9\u0394</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

As autophagosomes form in proximity to each other in nutrient rich and starved cells, the regulated phosphorylation of Sec24 would prevent the inappropriate fusion of COPII vesicles with Atg9 membranes during constitutive growth."

We have shown Hrr25 is required for autophagy and functions upstream of COPII vesicle delivery to the PAS (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2015</a>), but how Hrr25 regulates COPII vesicles on this pathway has been unclear. The findings we present here show that, during autophagy, Hrr25 acts through Sec24 by regulating its interaction with Atg9. As Hrr25 has been linked to the TOR network (<a href=\"#bib7\">Breitkreutz et al., 2010</a>), a key negative regulator of autophagy (<a href=\"#bib27\">Loewith and Hall, 2011</a>), it is tempting to speculate that Hrr25 works with one or more kinases that act downstream of Tor during nutrient deprivation. We propose that the heightened need to rapidly produce autophagosomes during starvation leads to phosphorylation of the Sec24 membrane distal surface, which enhances the Sec24-Atg9 interaction, resulting in an increase in autophagy to maintain homeostasis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). These events are independent of the assembly of the Atg hierarchy that occurs when autophagy is induced."

However, because it has been difficult to fully tease apart the function of COPII vesicles on the secretory pathway from their role in autophagy, their contribution to autophagy has been problematic to address. Our finding that phosphorylation of a novel conserved regulatory surface of Sec24 is specifically required for autophagy and not ER-Golgi transport conclusively demonstrates that COPII vesicles play a direct role in autophagy, rather than an indirect role in maintaining the trafficking of autophagy machinery through the secretory pathway. Additionally, we can now ascribe an autophagy-specific role to COPII vesicles in enhancing autophagosome number during nutrient deprivation, which is likely to be conserved."

During starvation, the ERES were found to translocate to the ERGIC fraction, and although the ERGIC is typically a location of COPI vesicle budding (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lorente-Rodr\u00edguez and Barlowe, 2011</a>), COPII vesicle budding from this ERGIC fraction was shown to be required for LC3 lipidation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ge et al., 2014</a>).

The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, resupsended in 5 ml of spheroplasting buffer and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Spheroplasts were pelleted through a 10 ml sorbitol cushion, resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer III (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1% Triton X-100, 1X protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)) and lysed with a dounce homogenizer on ice. Lysates were then cleared by a 15 min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. To immunoprecipitate Hrr25-HA, lysates were incubated with 20 \u00b5l anti-HA resin (Sigma) for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C with rotation. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2% NP-40 and 1 mM DTT). The kinase activity of immunopurified Hrr25-HA was assayed in a 50 \u00b5l reaction volume using 1 \u00b5g of myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate as described before (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wang et al., 2013</a>)."

Recent evidence in yeast and mammals indicate the involvement of COPII vesicles as a contribution to the autophagic membrane. However, how COPII vesicles are diverted from ER-Golgi trafficking to support autophagosome biogenesis was not clear. Some previous evidence shed light on the possible mechanism. For example, the Ge L et al. indicated a spatial regulation by generating the COPII from the ERGIC to separate from the COPII for trafficking which is from the ERES (Ge L et al. <i>eLife</i> 2014) in mammalian cells. Yeast cells lack a special ERGIC. Nonetheless, COPII is still essential for autophagosome biogenesis as shown by the last author's work as well as the Ohsumi group. Since there is no obvious solution to spatially separate the autophagic COPII from the ER-Golgi trafficking COPII in yeast, different mechanisms should be involved. Based on the authors' previous work, they hypothesized that phosphorylation of COPII components should be a reasonable mechanism accounting for the diversion of COPII to autophagy. In the current study, the authors analyzed the phosphorylation of Sec24 because Graef et al. found an association between Sec24 and Atg9 in a previous large scale proteomic analysis (Graef et al. MBoC 2013). They identified the phosphorylation sites of Sec24 and created different loss or gain of function mutations. They found that three membrane distal phosphorylation sites are required for the number of autophagosomes formed during starvation possibly due to their association with Atg9. The Hrr25 is the kinase required for Sec24 phosphorylation and the proposed process shown in the final model. In general, the story is a nice extension of their previous studies. The new advance is to employ the phosphorylation to explain the selection of COPII function. More experiments are necessary to validate the process."

Mechanistically, phosphorylation of these residues promotes the interaction between the C-terminus of Atg9 and Sec24, which is important for the increase in the number rather than the size of autophagosomes.

Thus, the authors' proposal that COPII vesicles contribute to autophagosome formation under starvation but not nutrient-rich conditions (Cvt vesicle formation) should be carefully reevaluated. In fact, it was reported that COPII mutants are defective in the Cvt pathway (Reggiori et al. Mol Biol Cell 15, 2189, 2004). The Cvt pathway should be directly examined by seeing the maturation of Ape1 in the 3A mutant."

Speaking to the novelty of the Atg9/Sec24 interaction, we note that although an earlier proteomics study linked Atg9 to multiple COPII coat subunits, it was not shown which COPII coat subunit drives this interaction. Furthermore, and most importantly, the significance of this interaction was not explored in the earlier study. Specifically, it was not demonstrated that the COPII-Atg9 interaction is required for autophagy. We now provide additional data that supports a role for Hrr25 in modulating autophagy via the Sec24 phosphosites (i.e. the suppression of Hrr25 autophagy defects by the Sec24 phosphomimetic mutations). Thus, our data shows the Atg9-COPII interaction is mediated by Sec24, regulated by the CK1 kinase Hrr25, and used as a mechanism to commit a COPII vesicle to the macroautophagy pathway. This is a novel discovery that contributes to our understanding of how membrane traffic is regulated during autophagy."

Monomeric Sec24 is unstable in the absence of Sec23, so we used purified Sec23/Sec24 complex to demonstrate a direct interaction between Atg9 and Sec23/Sec24. Additionally, using bacterially-expressed monomeric Sec23, to rule out an interaction between Atg9 and Sec23, allows us to conclude that the Atg9-COPII coat interaction requires Sec24. We note that the crystal structure of Sec23 and Sec24 are identical whether they are in complex with each other or not, making allosteric effects entirely unlikely. We further defined the site of interaction with Atg9 by domain dissection. Atg9 is a multi-spanning transmembrane protein that contains cytoplasmic N-(Atg9N; aa 2-318) and C- (Atg9C; aa 747- 997) termini. The middle of the protein is membrane-bound with a small domain (Atg9M; aa 395-534) that faces the cytosol. We fused the three cytoplasmic domains of Atg9 to GST, purified them from bacteria and performed in vitro binding experiments with purified Sec23/Sec24 complex. We found that the Sec23/Sec24 complex bound in vitro to GST-Atg9C. Importantly, binding is specific, appears to be saturable and dependent on the presence of Sec24 in the complex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C-F</a>).

However, the yield of Atg9 vesicles formed in vitro was very low, and the Atg8 lipidation reaction is not very efficient in yeast, leading us to abandon this approach. More recently, in collaboration with Thomas Wollert\u2019s lab, we have been examining the interaction of COPII-coated liposomes with liposomes containing Atg9. Consistent with our in vitro binding data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), preliminary experiments using the Atg9 core incorporated into liposomes (aa 281-779 in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) showed no specific interaction with coated vesicles containing Sec24. These experiments were complicated by the lipid composition used in the Atg9 vesicle preparation, and the affinity of each component for lipids. We are thus continuing to collaborate with Thomas\u2019s lab to better dissect the membrane-related effects of Sec24 and Atg9, but this avenue goes beyond the scope of this manuscript."

Recent evidence in yeast and mammals indicate the involvement of COPII vesicles as a contribution to the autophagic membrane. However, how COPII vesicles are diverted from ER-Golgi trafficking to support autophagosome biogenesis was not clear. Some previous evidence shed light on the possible mechanism. For example, the Ge L et al. indicated a spatial regulation by generating the COPII from the ERGIC to separate from the COPII for trafficking which is from the ERES (Ge L et al. eLife 2014) in mammalian cells. Yeast cells lack a special ERGIC. Nonetheless, COPII is still essential for autophagosome biogenesis as shown by the last author's work as well as the Ohsumi group. Since there is no obvious solution to spatially separate the autophagic COPII from the ER-Golgi trafficking COPII in yeast, different mechanisms should be involved. Based on the authors' previous work, they hypothesized that phosphorylation of COPII components should be a reasonable mechanism accounting for the diversion of COPII to autophagy. In the current study, the authors analyzed the phosphorylation of Sec24 because Graef et al. found an association between Sec24 and Atg9 in a previous large scale proteomic analysis (Graef et al. MBoC 2013). They identified the phosphorylation sites of Sec24 and created different loss or gain of function mutations. They found that three membrane distal phosphorylation sites are required for the number of autophagosomes formed during starvation possibly due to their association with Atg9. The Hrr25 is the kinase required for Sec24 phosphorylation and the proposed process shown in the final model. In general, the story is a nice extension of their previous studies. The new advance is to employ the phosphorylation to explain the selection of COPII function. More experiments are necessary to validate the process.</i> "
