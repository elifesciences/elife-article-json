The fertilization products are surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat, whose development prior to fertilization is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group (PcG) protein family. Here we show that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin and most likely its export to the maternal tissues, which drives seed coat development by removing PcG function. We furthermore show that mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have an impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, which results in seed abortion. We propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development."

The fertilization products are surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat, whose development prior to fertilization is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group (PcG) protein family. Here we show that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin and most likely its export to the maternal tissues, which drives seed coat development by removing PcG function. We furthermore show that mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have an impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, which results in seed abortion. We propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development."

Exposing unfertilized flowers to auxin caused a seed coat to form even though the endosperm was absent. This suggests that this hormone alone is sufficient to trigger the formation of the seed coat without any other signals. Further analysis revealed that a protein called AGL62 regulates the movement of auxin to the parts of the flower that give rise to the seed coat. In the absence of AGL62, the hormone remains trapped in the endosperm and the seed coat fails to develop. The next step following on from this work is to understand how auxin moves from the endosperm to the parts of the flower that form the seed coat."

These two fertilization products are surrounded by the seed coat, a sporophytic tissue of purely maternal origin. While the embryo is the only component of the seed that will form the next generation, it contributes little to seed growth. Instead, the interplay between the\u00a0endosperm and seed coat determines the final size of the seed. Impaired endosperm proliferation has a negative effect on seed coat development, as is the case in the <i>Arabidopsis haiku</i> or <i>miniseed</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib21\">Garcia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Luo et al., 2005</a>) or in transgenic lines expressing diphtheria toxin A in the endosperm (<a href=\"#bib57\">Weijers et al., 2003</a>). And, conversely, mutations that affect seed coat expansion limit endosperm growth, such as <i>transparent testa glabra 2</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Garcia et al., 2005</a>), while mutants with increased integument cell proliferation like <i>megaintegumenta</i>/<i>auxin responsive factor 2</i>, result in enlarged seeds with more abundant endosperm (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schruff et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, the absence of the endothelium integument layer results in seed abortion, highlighting the importance of the developing seed coat for the establishment of a viable seed (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mizzotti et al., 2012</a>)."

Seed coat initiation is dependent on the fertilization of the female gametophyte, but mutants for sporophytically-acting Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins develop a seed coat without fertilization in a dosage-sensitive manner (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roszak and K\u00f6hler, 2011</a>). PcG proteins assemble into multimeric complexes, of which the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) represses target loci through the deposition of trimethyl groups on lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mozgova et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, the initiation of seed coat development prior to fertilization is inhibited by sporophytically active PRC2 complexes and this block is relieved following fertilization through a signal derived from the fertilization products (<a href=\"#bib19\">Figueiredo and K\u00f6hler, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mozgova et al., 2015</a>).

In order to test whether this activation was specific to the seed coat we investigated the behavior of auxin and GA reporter lines before and after fertilization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). To monitor auxin signaling, we investigated expression of the <i>DR5v2::VENUS</i> reporter (<a href=\"#bib33\">Liao et al., 2015</a>) before and after fertilization. There was no <i>DR5v2::VENUS</i> reporter activity in unfertilized ovules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), with the exception of a few cells neighboring the vascular bundle and occasionally near the antipodal cells. However, shortly after fertilization VENUS activity was detectable in the sporophytic tissues, where it persisted throughout seed development, with particular incidence in the funiculus and the micropylar region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). We further substantiated these observations with the use of the R2D2 auxin sensor system (<a href=\"#bib33\">Liao et al., 2015</a>). Before fertilization there was a strong DII:VENUS expression in the integuments, indicating very low or absent auxin signaling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, this signal was quickly depleted following fertilization, as early as the first division of the central cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Conversely, the auxin-insensitive mDII:Tdtomato remained stable in the seed coat, indicating a stable expression of the <i>RPS5a</i> promoter, that drives both reporter genes. These observations indicate a rapid accumulation of auxin in the sporophytic tissues following fertilization of the maternal gametes."

We raised transgenic plants expressing a GA biosynthesis gene (<i>GA3ox1</i>) under the control of the <i>BANYULS</i> (<i>BAN</i>) promoter, which is active in the innermost integument/seed coat layer (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Debeaujon et al., 2003</a>). We emasculated <i>BAN::GA3ox1</i> transgenic plants and performed vanillin staining at 5 DAE to test for initiation of seed coat development.

In order to test whether increased auxin production in the integuments triggers autonomous seed coat development, we analyzed the gain-of-function <i>yuc6-2D</i> mutant, in which the auxin biosynthesis gene <i>YUCCA6</i> (<i>YUC6</i>) is ectopically expressed due to the insertion of a Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S (CaMV35S) enhancer sequence in its promotor region (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim et al., 2007</a>).Activation of the <i>YUC6</i> gene in <i>yuc6-2D</i> is expected to be restricted to sporophytic tissues, as the CaMV35S enhancer is not active in the female gametophyte (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roszak and K\u00f6hler, 2011</a>).We therefore tested whether increased auxin production in the integuments of <i>yuc6-2D</i> plants resulted in the\u00a0autonomous development of the seed coat, as scored by vanillin staining. Indeed, up to 50% of <i>yuc6-2D</i> ovules stained with vanillin, while less than 5% of WT ovules were stained (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).These observations reveal that both auxin and GA<sub>3</sub> are sufficient to trigger seed coat development without fertilization."

This hypothesis is in agreement with our previous observations that auxin is produced in the endosperm after fertilization (<a href=\"#bib17\">Figueiredo et al., 2015</a>). In order to test whether auxin produced in the endosperm is necessary for seed coat development, we analyzed mutants deficient either in auxin signaling (<i>axr1</i>/+ <i>axl-1</i>/-) or auxin biosynthesis (<i>wei8</i>/- <i>tar1</i>/- <i>tar2-1</i>/+ and <i>wei8</i>/- <i>tar1</i>/- <i>tar2-2</i>/+). The homozygous <i>axr1</i>/- <i>axl-1</i>/- mutant is zygotic lethal, thus 25% of seeds from an <i>axr1</i>/+ <i>axl-1</i>/- plant will abort (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dharmasiri et al., 2007</a>). Nevertheless, those seeds did not differ in size compared to WT seeds at 3 DAP and were only slightly smaller compared to their WT counterparts at 5 DAP, indicating that seed coat development is not impaired (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We thus conclude that auxin signaling in the fertilization products (endosperm and embryo) is not necessary to initiate seed coat development. In contrast, <i>wei/tar</i> mutants affected in auxin biosynthesis showed seeds aborting at different sizes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Namely, around 2.5% of seeds completely failed to develop a seed coat and another 20\u201330% of seeds did not reach full WT size (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>). No differences were observed in the integument cell number between the mutant and WT ovules (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that cell expansion following fertilization is affected in the <i>wei</i>/<i>tar</i> mutant. These observations strongly support the idea that post-fertilization production of auxin in the fertilization products is necessary for the early stages of seed coat development in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, but that auxin signalling does not seem to be required for full seed expansion until later developmental stages."

To further challenge this hypothesis, we investigated plants mutant for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62. <i>agl62</i> seeds abort early after fertilization (around 3\u20134 DAP), correlating with early endosperm cellularization (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kang et al., 2008</a>) and failure to develop a seed coat (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roszak and K\u00f6hler, 2011</a>). The <i>agl62</i> mutant did not show defects in integument cell number, implying compromised cell expansion following fertilization (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To test whether the early cellularization of <i>agl62</i> was the cause for the defects in seed coat development, we crossed plants mutant for <i>agl62</i>/+ with a mutant for <i>HALLIMASCH</i> (<i>hal</i>/+), whose seeds fail to undergo endosperm cellularization (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mayer et al., 1999</a>). In <i>agl62</i> seeds the endosperm cellularizes at around 3 DAP, but in double mutant <i>agl62 hal</i> seeds this early cellularization phenotype is reverted (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). However, similarly to the single <i>agl62</i> mutant, <i>agl62 hal</i> seeds do not develop a seed coat and remain small. We thus propose that early cellularization of <i>agl62</i> endosperm is a consequence, rather than a cause of the failure to develop seed coat. Given that AGL62 is solely expressed in the endosperm (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Roszak and K\u00f6hler, 2011</a>), we hypothesized whether this transcription factor could be involved in regulating the pathways driving seed coat development. Consistently, GA signaling was not activated in <i>agl62</i> integuments, as evidenced by the maintained GFP signal of the RGA DELLA reporter (<i>RGA::GFP:RGA)</i> in <i>agl62</i> seeds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1G</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5D</a>). Importantly, also auxin signaling was impaired in <i>agl62</i> integuments, which failed to express the <i>DR5::VENUS reporter</i>. Strikingly however, while no VENUS signal was observed in <i>agl62</i> integuments, we could clearly observe VENUS expression in the endosperm of <i>agl62</i> seeds (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>), contrasting the absence of VENUS activity in WT seeds. These results strongly suggest that in WT seeds, auxin is produced in the endosperm after fertilization and quickly exported into the integuments. However, in the absence of AGL62, auxin export is impaired and it accumulates in the endosperm at sufficiently high levels to activate <i>DR5</i> expression."

Lack of the core PRC2 subunits VRN2 and EMF2 results in a\u00a0dosage-dependent autonomous seed coat development, as visualized by staining of protoanthocyanidins using vanillin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). Thus, lack of PRC2 function and ectopic auxin are sufficient to initiate seed coat development in the absence of fertilization; we therefore asked whether auxin and PRC2 act in the same pathway initiating seed coat development. To test this hypothesis, we generated triple mutant plants that have reduced PRC2 function and produce auxin ectopically in the integuments by combining mutant alleles for <i>yuc6-2d, vrn2</i>/- and <i>emf2</i>/+. No differences in integument cell number were observed in these mutants, compared to WT, implying that autonomous ovule growth is mediated by cell expansion (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). By scoring protoanthocyanidin production as a proxy for seed coat formation we compared the number of ovules forming autonomous seed coat in this triple mutant to those formed in the <i>yuc6-2d</i> single mutant and the <i>vrn2</i>/- <i>emf2</i>/+ double mutant. Ovules of the triple mutant and the <i>yuc6-2d</i> single mutant initiated autonomous seed coat development at similar frequencies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), suggesting that auxin and PRC2 act in the same pathway."

                                "text": "Based on the results showing that auxin is the endosperm-derived seed coat initiation signal, it seems most likely that auxin acts upstream of PRC2 during seed coat development. That being the case, autonomous seed coat development in mutants for the PRC2 core components VRN2 and EMF2 should not coincide with the\u00a0activation of auxin signaling in the integuments. To test this hypothesis, we crossed the <i>DR5v2</i> and R2D2 auxin reporters into the <i>vrn2 emf2</i> double mutant background. As predicted, despite that <i>vrn2</i>/+ <i>emf2</i>/+ ovules initiated seed coat development at 5 DAE, there was no detectable expression of <i>DR5v2</i>, contrasting to its expression post-fertilization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). Similarly, we did not observe an efficient removal of the DII:VENUS signal from <i>vrn2</i>/- <i>emf2</i>/+ ovules, unlike what happens post-fertilization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These observations strongly support the hypothesis that auxin acts upstream of the PRC2 complex, and might have a role in removing the PRC2-block on seed coat development. To investigate how PRC2 function is depleted following either fertilization or application of auxin, we analyzed transgenic lines expressing translational reporters for the PRC2 components MSI1 and SWN, as well as for the PRC2-associated protein LHP1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Derkacheva et al., 2013</a>). Before fertilization there was a strong expression of all three reporters in the integuments, which markedly decreased following fertilization (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Interestingly, a similar decrease in reporter activity was observed in unfertilized ovules following exogenous application of 2,4-D (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,F and I</a>), but no changes were observed in mock-treated ovules (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These observations support the view that post-fertilization auxin transport to the integuments leads to the removal of PRC2 and LHP1 proteins. To test whether the downregulation of PRC2 components occurred at the transcriptional level, we tested the expression of genes coding for sporophytic PRC2 components. All the genes tested were strongly downregulated after fertilization (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>) as well as after exogenous application of 2,4-D in unfertilized ovules (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This data reveals that the auxin-dependent removal of PRC2 function is likely to occur at the transcriptional level; nevertheless, an additional post-translational regulation of PRC2 components by auxin cannot be completely ruled out."

Indeed, the GA biosynthesis gene <i>GA20ox2</i> was upregulated in <i>vrn2</i>/- <i>emf2</i>/+ ovules while the GA catabolism genes <i>GA2ox6</i> and <i>GA2ox2</i> were downregulated when compared to WT (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Table 1\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To further test this hypothesis, we crossed the GA reporter <i>RGA::GFP:RGA</i> into mutants deficient for either PRC2 components <i>VRN2</i> and <i>EMF2</i> or <i>SWN</i> and <i>CLF</i>, and analyzed <i>GFP</i> expression in unfertilized ovules. Indeed, when compared to WT ovules, the ovules mutant for <i>vrn2</i>/+ <i>emf2</i>/+ or <i>swn</i>/+ <i>clf</i>/+ had a strongly reduced GFP:RGA signal, particularly in the innermost layers of the integuments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H\u2013J</a>) This was observed both at 5 DAE, when the autonomous seeds were significantly larger than WT ovules, but also at 2 DAE, indicating that activation of GA signalling takes place shortly after anthesis (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This decreased signal is most likely due to RGA protein degradation, since the <i>RGA</i> gene was not downregulated in the <i>vrn2</i>/- <i>emf2</i>/+ mutant (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Table 1\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

As the maternal integuments do not take part in the fertilization process, the signal that coordinates the development of the fertilization products with the maternal integuments remained elusive (<a href=\"#bib18\">Figueiredo and K\u00f6hler, 2016</a>). Based on previous research it seemed likely that the signal is generated in the endosperm, as endosperm development is required to drive seed coat initiation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib57\">Weijers et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ingouff et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Roszak and K\u00f6hler, 2011</a>). It was furthermore known that the presence of the paternal genome is necessary for the seed coat to develop, as mutants for <i>cdka;1</i> and <i>fbl17</i>, in which one of the sperm cells fails to undergo karyogamy with the central cell, do not develop a seed coat (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gusti et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aw et al., 2010</a>). These observations strongly suggest that the signal driving seed coat development should be dependent on genes that are paternally-expressed in the endosperm. Auxin biosynthesis following fertilization of the central cell is dependent on the paternally-expressed genes <i>YUC10</i> and <i>TAR1</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Figueiredo et al., 2015</a>), raising the hypothesis that auxin could be the trigger for seed coat initiation. In this manuscript we provide multiple lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis: (i) auxin rapidly accumulates in the integuments after fertilization, (ii) impaired auxin biosynthesis but not auxin signaling in the endosperm causes defects in seed coat development, (iii) ovules of transgenic lines producing auxin ectopically in the central cell initiate seed coat development without fertilization, (iv) failure of seed coat development in the <i>agl62</i> mutant correlates with failure to export auxin. Collectively, our data strongly support the hypothesis that auxin generated in the fertilized central cell/endosperm is the trigger for seed coat formation. Impaired auxin signaling in the endosperm did not impair seed coat formation, strongly supporting the hypothesis that auxin is exported to the integuments, where it initiates downstream signaling events. We could show that the ABCB transporter <i>PGP10</i> is expressed in the fertilized central cell and its expression depends on the type I MADS-box transcription factor AGL62, suggesting that PGP10 may regulate the export of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments. PGPs are known to depend on additional proteins for their localization and function (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bouchard et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2013</a>), likely explaining our failure to restore seed coat development in <i>agl62</i> by ectopically expressing <i>PGP10</i>. It is furthermore possible that additional AGL62 targets are required for successful auxin export from the endosperm and are therefore lacking in the <i>agl62</i> mutant. Future research will focus on identifying the remaining factors required for PGP10 function."

We now propose a dual role for post-fertilization auxin production, both in driving endosperm and seed coat development. Additionally, the <i>agl62</i> mutant has defects both in seed coat development in fertilized ovules and endosperm development in autonomous seeds. This suggests that AGL62, like auxin, is involved in mediating both endosperm and seed coat developmental pathways. It was recently proposed that AGL62 in the endosperm also mediates non-autonomous cell signalling driving nucellus degeneration (<a href=\"#bib61\">Xu et al., 2016</a>). This transcription factor thus seems to be a central player in modulating diverse developmental pathways during seed development."

This implies that auxin is sufficient to initiate seed coat development, but that additional signals are necessary to support its full expansion and prevent the degeneration of the ovule. Recent work has shown that the innermost layer of the outer ovule integument perceives mechanical cues from the expanding endosperm, which affects cell wall thickening and GA metabolism in that cell layer (<a href=\"#bib11\">Creff et al., 2015</a>). It is therefore an attractive hypothesis that auxin is the initial paternally-derived signal that drives the integument-to-seed coat developmental transition, and that mechanical pressure from the syncytial endosperm sustains seed coat growth. This view is supported by observations showing that mutants affected in syncytial endosperm proliferation have smaller seeds when compared to WT plants (<a href=\"#bib21\">Garcia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Luo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Conversely, a gain-of-function mutation in <i>SHORT HYPOCOTYL UNDER BLUE1</i> results in increased proliferation of the syncytial endosperm delayed cellularization and increased seed size (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>). Additionally, it cannot be ruled out that other signalling pathways contribute to sustain seed coat growth, such as small peptide-mediated signalling (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ingram and Gutierrez-Marcos, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Figueiredo and K\u00f6hler, 2016</a>)"

Here, we demonstrate that ectopic auxin can bypass the PRC2 block on seed coat development, which leads to activation of GA signaling and production of protoanthocyanidins in the integuments. We propose that transport of auxin from the developing endosperm is required for the removal of PRC2 function in the integuments, allowing for the development of the seed coat by activation of GA signaling (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Also in mammals PRC2 regulates the transition from proliferation to differentiation during organogenesis and PRC2 function has to be removed to allow differentiation of embryonic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Leeb et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aldiri and Vetter, 2012</a>). We further show that exogenous auxin is sufficient to remove PRC2 function from the ovule integuments. Our gene expression analysis revealed that sporophytic PRC2-coding genes are downregulated after fertilization, likely due to increased auxin signalling in the integuments. Auxin is known to extensively modulate transcription (<a href=\"#bib58\">Weijers and Wagner, 2016</a>), but the mechanism by which it regulates PRC2-coding genes is yet to be understood. In fact, although there are reports on the transcriptional regulation of PRC2 genes in animals (<a href=\"#bib40\">Neri et al., 2012</a>), there is very little information on how the\u00a0plant PRC2 activity is regulated. Thus, we provide the first evidence on the modulation of the\u00a0PRC2 activity by a plant hormone, as a way to modulate developmental transitions."

The fertilization of the central cell (middle panel) results in the production of auxin that is exported to the integuments, lifting the PRC2 block on seed coat development and allowing for cell elongation and differentiation. However, this process is highly dependent on the activity of the transcription factor AGL62, since <i>agl62</i> seeds fail to export auxin from the endosperm. This leads to auxin accumulation and consequently, failure to develop a seed coat (right panel).

The amplified fragments were purified from the gel, recombined into the donor vector (pDONR221) to create entry clones, and sequenced. Gateway cloning was done according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen, Fisher Scientific, Sweden). The promoter of <i>PGP10</i> was recombined into vector pB7FWG.0. The coding region of <i>GA3ox1</i> and <i>PGP10</i> were recombined into vector pB7WG2, where the 35 s promoter was replaced by that of <i>BAN</i> and <i>AGL62</i>, respectively, using the restriction enzymes <i>Sac</i>I and <i>Spe</i>I. The MSI1 translational reporter was obtained by replacing the TAP fragment in the <i>MSI::MSI1:TAP</i> construct with GFP (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouveret et al., 2006</a>). The <i>BAN::GFP</i> reporter was generated by recombining the amplified promoter sequence of <i>BAN</i> and the coding sequence of <i>GFP</i> into the pBGW vector.

Furthermore, ovules of transgenic lines expressing <i>DD65::TAA1; DD65::YUC6</i> initiate seed coat development before the central cell starts replicating. At 5 DAE the ovules are larger than WT and they stain strongly with vanillin (as we show in this manuscript), but autonomous central cell replication can only be seen at 6 DAE (Figueiredo et al., 2015). This suggests that endosperm proliferation is not required for seed coat initiation, if auxin is ectopically produced.
