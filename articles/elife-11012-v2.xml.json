A similar challenge presumably limited the emergence of large and complex protein topologies in evolution. Here, we demonstrate that protein topologies with six and seven-stranded beta sheets can be designed by insertion of one de novo designed beta sheet containing protein into another such that the two beta sheets are merged to form a single extended sheet, followed by amino acid sequence optimization at the newly formed strand-strand, strand-helix, and helix-helix interfaces. Crystal structures of two such designs closely match the computational design models. Searches for similar structures in the SCOP protein domain database yield only weak matches with different beta sheet connectivities. A similar beta sheet fusion mechanism may have contributed to the emergence of complex beta sheets during natural protein evolution."

A similar challenge presumably limited the emergence of large and complex protein topologies in evolution. Here, we demonstrate that protein topologies with six and seven-stranded beta sheets can be designed by insertion of one de novo designed beta sheet containing protein into another such that the two beta sheets are merged to form a single extended sheet, followed by amino acid sequence optimization at the newly formed strand-strand, strand-helix, and helix-helix interfaces. Crystal structures of two such designs closely match the computational design models. Searches for similar structures in the SCOP protein domain database yield only weak matches with different beta sheet connectivities. A similar beta sheet fusion mechanism may have contributed to the emergence of complex beta sheets during natural protein evolution."

Multi-domain proteins likely evolved through simple linear concatenation of successive domains onto the polypeptide chain or through the insertion of one or more continuous sequences into the middle of another, now discontinuous domain (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aroul-Selvam et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berrondo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lupas et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Pandya et al., 2013</a>). By analogy, new proteins have been engineered from existing domains by simple linear concatenation or insertion of one domain into another (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ay et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Collinet et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cutler et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Doi and Yanagawa, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Edwards et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Guntas and Ostermeier, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ostermeier, 2005</a>).\u00a0How individual domains evolved, in contrast, is much less clear. Both experimental and computational analyses have suggested that new folds can evolve by insertion of one fold into another (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lupas et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Grishin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">S\u00f6ding and Lupas, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Krishna and Grishin, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Friedberg and Godzik, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ben-Tal and Kolodny, 2014</a>), but to our knowledge, there is no evidence that complex beta sheet topologies can be formed in this manner. On the protein design front, there has been progress in de novo design of idealized helical bundles (<a href=\"#bib22\">Park et al., 2015</a>) and alpha beta protein structures with up to 5 strands (<a href=\"#bib15\">Koga et al., 2012</a>), and although new folds have been generated by tandem fusion of natural protein domains followed by introduction of additional stabilizing mutations\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Hocker et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Shanmugaratnam et al., 2012</a>), assembly of large and complex beta sheets poses a challenge for de novo protein design."

Here, we explore the viability of such a mechanism by inserting one de novo designed alpha beta protein into another such that the two beta sheets are combined into one. The backbone geometry at the junctions between the original domains is regularized, and the sequence at the newly formed interface is optimized to stabilize the single integrated domain structure. Crystal structures of two such proteins demonstrate that complex beta sheet structures can be designed with considerable accuracy using this approach and provide a proof-of-concept for the hypothesis that complex beta topologies in natural proteins may have evolved from simpler beta sheet structures in a similar manner."

A beta turn segment between two beta strands of the host ferredoxin was removed and the resulting cut-points in the host beta strands were linked to two beta strand cut-points in the insert, fusing the two strand pairs into a single, longer pair at the center of a six-stranded beta sheet. CD spectra show that the protein contains both alpha and beta structures (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Crystals were obtained which diffracted to 3.3\u00c5 resolution. Molecular replacement using the computational design models (<a href=\"#bib7\">DiMaio et al., 2013</a>) yielded a solution for which the refinement statistics are shown in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> (PDB entry 5CW9). Attempts to improve these statistics by rebuilding portions of the model proved unsuccessful, possibly due to a register shift or dynamic fluctuations in the structure (perhaps corresponding to slightly 'molten-globule'-like behavior) that are difficult to computationally model. However, unbiased low-resolution omit maps suggest that the overall topology is correct (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In the model that displays the best refinement statistics, the protein backbone was similar to the design model with a C-alpha RMSD value of 2 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). The fused beta sheet aligns with the design model, while the inter-domain helices shift slightly to accommodate the inter-domain interface. The sidechain packing between the newly juxtaposed beta strands succeeded in anchoring the secondary structure elements in their intended orientations, but the low resolution of the crystal structure prevents evaluation of the atomic-level accuracy of the design (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The most similar SCOP domains had weak TM-align scores (0.54 and 0.51), and the sheets in these matched structures have different connectivities than those of the designs, suggesting that the two designed proteins have novel folds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). While there are no domains with globally similar folds, both designed proteins are similar to a number of SCOP domains over the ferrodoxin-like substructure(s) (maps of the proteins to the domain network of Nepomnyachiy et al.

These three domains were chosen because they were the only Rosetta de\u00a0novo designed protein domains with both alpha and beta secondary structures for which high-resolution experimental structures had been obtained at the time of this work. Each chimeric domain consists of a parent host domain and a parent insert domain. In the insert domain, three residues from from the N-terminus were paired with three residue from the C-terminus to create nine residue pairs. Each residue pair was then aligned against all pairs of residues in the host domain to search for possible insertion points. Insertion points were accepted for residue pair alignment distances of 1 angstrom RMSD or less, replacing host domain segments of less than 5 residues. For every insertion point, a structure is generated by removing the residues between the insertion residues of the host domain and adding linkers between the aligned host and insert domain residues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Host and insert were connected by addition of 1\u20133 residues at the domain junctions using Rosetta Remodel (<a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2011</a>), and 12 models in which this junction formed a continuous beta strand were identified. The sequences of these chimeras were optimized using Rosetta Design calculations around the junction regions and the new interface between the former domains. During the design simulation, all amino acid positions within 5 \u00c5 of the inter-domain junction interface were redesigned to minimize the predicted free energy of folding with the Rosetta all-atom energy function and a flexible backbone protein design protocol described previously (<a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2011</a>). Final designs were selected based on Rosetta energy, packing metrics, and similarity of the junction backbone geometry to local backbone geometry in the PDB. Twelve final domain insertion designs were chosen for expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> as 6xHis-tag fusions and purified on a Ni-NTA column. Purified proteins were evaluated for the presence of alpha/beta secondary structures via circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), and three with levels of secondary structure content consistent with the design model were subjected to crystallographic analysis. One design based on Rossman 2x2 expressed as soluble protein, but no crystal structure could be obtained. Crystal structures were obtained for two designed proteins: a ferredoxin-top7 chimera and a ferredoxin-ferredoxin chimera. The design and characterization of these two proteins is described in the Results."

First, crystal structures (ferredoxin-top7: 4KYZ chain A, ferredoxin-ferredoxin: 5CW9 chain A) were used as search queries using TMalign (<a href=\"#bib28\">Zhang, 2005</a>). Hits were saved only if the alignment covered 75% or more of the query structure. Results were sorted by TM-score to identify the most similar structures in the SCOP database. Secondary structure topology cartoons were created with the Pro Origami server (<a href=\"#bib25\">Stivala et al., 2011</a>). To map designed protein crystal structures into the protein domains network, the structures were aligned to all domain structures in the protein domains network using the PDBeFold server (<a href=\"#bib17\">Krissinel and Henrick, 2004</a>). PDBeFold structural alignment hits were filtered for RMSD \u22642.5\u00a0\u00c5 and aligned sequence length of \u226575 residues. In contrast to the methods of Nepomnyachi et al., sequence similarity thresholds were ignored. Including sequence similarity thresholds eliminates matching hits in the domains network. This is not surprising because the proteins were designed de novo and did not evolve from natural proteins. Filtered alignment hits were mapped into the protein domains network using Cytoscape (<a href=\"#bib24\">Shannon, 2003</a>). To evaluate neutral drift models of the parent folds, then crystal structures of de novo ferredoxin and Top7 proteins (2KL8 and 1QYS) were obtained and corresponding mutations from the final design proteins were modeled using a flexible backbone protein design algorithm described previously (<a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2011</a>). Final Rosetta energies were calculated and subtracted from the Rosetta energies of the original parent protein structures to obtain predictions of the change in free energy of folding."

Briefly, <i>E. coli</i> BL21 (DE3) pMGK cells, a rare-codon enhanced strain, were transformed with the DNA sequence-verified OR327-21.1 plasmid. A single isolate was cultured in MJ9 minimal media supplemented with selenomethionine, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine for the production of selenomethionine-labeled OR327. Initial growth was carried out at 37\u00b0C until the OD600 of the culture reached \u223c0.8 units. The incubation temperature was then decreased to 17\u00b0C, and protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 1 mM. Following overnight incubation at 17\u00b0C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in Lysis Buffer [50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 40 mM imidazole]. After sonication, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation for 40 min at 30,000 <i>g</i>. The supernatant was loaded first onto a Ni affinity column (HisTrap HP; GE Healthcare,\u00a0Marlborough,\u00a0MA) and the eluate loaded into a gel filtration column (Superdex 75 26/60; GE Healthcare). Yields were 60-\u201390 mg/L. The purified 6His-OR327 construct in buffer containing 10 mM Tris\u00b7HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, pH 7.5, was then concentrated to \u223c10.6 mg/mL. The sample was flash-frozen in 50-\u03bcL aliquots using liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C before crystallization trials. The sample purity (&gt;98%), molecular weight, and oligomerization state were verified by SDS/PAGE, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and analytic gel filtration followed by static light scattering, respectively.

Perhaps map the parent and designed folds into the domains network of Nepomnyachiy et al. PNAS 111, 1691-11696, 2014. Of these 3 novelties, only the third justifies publication in</i> eLife<i>, provided that the new fold differs significantly from the original ones.</i> "
