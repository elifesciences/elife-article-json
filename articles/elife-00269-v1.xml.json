Previous studies have shown that the gradual decline in microRNA156 (miR156) with age promotes the expression of adult traits. However, how age temporally regulates the abundance of miR156 is poorly understood. We show here that the expression of miR156 responds to sugar. Sugar represses miR156 expression at both the transcriptional level and post-transcriptional level through the degradation of miR156 primary transcripts. Defoliation and photosynthetic mutant assays further demonstrate that sugar from the pre-existing leaves acts as a mobile signal to repress miR156, and subsequently triggers the juvenile-to-adult phase transition in young leaf primordia. We propose that the gradual increase in sugar after seed germination serves as an endogenous cue for developmental timing in plants."

Previous studies have shown that the gradual decline in microRNA156 (miR156) with age promotes the expression of adult traits. However, how age temporally regulates the abundance of miR156 is poorly understood. We show here that the expression of miR156 responds to sugar. Sugar represses miR156 expression at both the transcriptional level and post-transcriptional level through the degradation of miR156 primary transcripts. Defoliation and photosynthetic mutant assays further demonstrate that sugar from the pre-existing leaves acts as a mobile signal to repress miR156, and subsequently triggers the juvenile-to-adult phase transition in young leaf primordia. We propose that the gradual increase in sugar after seed germination serves as an endogenous cue for developmental timing in plants."

The transition from the juvenile to adult phase is marked by acquisition of reproductive competence and changes in leaf morphology (<a href=\"#bib24\">Poethig, 2010</a>). The adult to reproductive transition, also known as flowering, transforms the identity of the shoot apical meristem from vegetative into inflorescence. Physiological and genetic studies have demonstrated that both developmental transitions are regulated not only by environmental signals such as day length, light intensity, and ambient temperature, but also by endogenous signals transmitted by plant hormones and age."

The expression of miR156 decreases over time, with a concomitant rise in SPL level (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wu and Poethig, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). Overexpression of miR156 prolongs the juvenile phase, whereas a reduction in miR156 level results in an accelerated expression of adult traits (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wu and Poethig, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Wu et al., 2009</a>). SPL promotes the juvenile-to-adult phase transition and flowering through activation of miR172 and MADS-box genes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Wu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yamaguchi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Jung et al., 2011</a>). Very recently, defoliation experiments and expression analyses demonstrated that the repression of miR156 in the leaf primordia is mediated by a mobile signal(s) derived from the pre-existing leaves (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yang et al. 2011</a>).

In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, diverse sugar signals are perceived and transduced through a glucose sensor, HEXOKINASE1 (HXK1). HXK1 exerts its regulatory function through distinct molecular mechanisms including transcriptional activation, translational inhibition, mRNA decay, and protein degradation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rolland and Sheen, 2005</a>). Analyses of two catalytic inactive <i>HXK1</i> alleles further indicate that the signaling activity of HXK1 is uncoupled from its catalytic activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Moore et al., 2003</a>). Recently, a nuclear HXK1 complex has been identified (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cho et al., 2006</a>). In this complex, HXK1 binds to two unconventional partners, the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase B1 (VHA-B1) and the 19S regulatory particle of a proteasome subunit (RPT5B). Since neither VHA-B1 nor RPT5B has DNA binding capacity, the precise molecular mechanism by which this nuclear-localized HXK1 complex regulates gene expression remains unanswered. In addition to the HXK1-dependent pathway, some glucose-responsive genes are regulated through an HXK1-independent pathway. For instance, the expression of the genes encoding chalcone synthase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and asparagine synthase responds to glucose signaling in the absence of HXK1 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Xiao et al., 2000</a>)."

Thus, gradual accumulation of sugar after seed germination leads to a reduced level of miR156, which promotes the juvenile-to-adult phase transition in plants."

Given the fact that sucrose is able to move within plants through the vascular tissues (<a href=\"#bib35\">Truernit 2001</a>) and that sucrose as well as its hydrolytic product, glucose, repress the expression of miR156, we speculated that sugar is a potential candidate for this mobile signal. To test this hypothesis, we first investigated the relationship between sugar content and the level of miR156 in vivo. Under long day conditions, Arabidopsis plants show a rapid life cycle with very short juvenile and adult phases. For this reason, we grew wild type plants under short day conditions to extend the vegetative phase. Then 15-day-old (in the juvenile phase) and 60-day-old (in the adult phase) plants were collected at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 16. Expression analyses demonstrated that miR156 was highly abundant in 15-day-old plants but less so in 60-day-old plants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast to this expression pattern, 60-day-old plants exhibited a higher level of glucose, fructose, and sucrose than 15-day-old plants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These results are consistent with our findings that sugar represses miR156 and indicate an inverse correlation between the level of miR156 and endogenous sugar content in vivo."

We propose a model explaining how sugar regulates the juvenile-to-adult phase transition through modulation of miR156 expression as follows. After seed germination, plants start accumulating sugars through photosynthesis. Sucrose, the major transportable sugar, moves from the pre-existing leaves to the young leaf primordia, where its hydrolytic hexose product, glucose, represses the expression of miR156. As a result, the level of <i>SPL</i> increases and the expression of adult traits is promoted."

Previous studies revealed that the floral transition is regulated by diverse environmental factors, such as photoperiod, temperature, and light, in combination with the endogenous signal derived from nutritional status. The nutrient-dependent regulation of flowering is likely dependant on the rate of sucrose export from source leaves (<a href=\"#bib11\">Corbesier et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Sivitz et al., 2007</a>). This notion is supported by our observations that sugar from pre-existing leaves acts as a long-distance signal to repress the expression of miR156 in young leaf primordia, and that a high level of miR156 delays flowering (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). Intriguingly, a recent study has demonstrated that INDETERMINATE DOMAIN transcription factor AtIDD8 regulates photoperiodic flowering by modulating sugar transport and metabolism (<a href=\"#bib30\">Seo et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that additional sugar-mediated flowering pathways exist."

In Arabidopsis, sucrose transporters are involved in loading sucrose into the phloem in source leaves and the uptake of sucrose into the cells of sink tissues such as roots, fruit, and developing leaves (<a href=\"#bib39\">Williams et al., 2000</a>). Very recently, the sucrose effluxers, SWEET11 and SWEET12, which facilitate sucrose efflux into the cell wall of companion cells, have been identified (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2011</a>). It is therefore interesting to investigate whether impairment of sucrose transport from leaf cells into the vascular system causes a defect in miR156 expression and developmental transitions."

                                "text": "There are several means by which sugar regulates gene expression. For example, sugar decreases the transcript level of rice <i>AMY3</i> at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. It was shown that destabilization of the mRNAs of <i>AMY3</i> is mediated by its 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chan and Yu, 1998</a>). Similarly, we found that <i>pri-MIR156A</i> and <i>pri-MIR156C</i> are subjected to transcriptional repression as well as transcript degradation in response to glucose. This two-level expression control by sugar might contribute to robust repression of miR156, which leads to irreversible transition from the juvenile to adult phase in plants. In Arabidopsis, HXK1 is a glucose sensor that transduces diverse aspects of sugar response. For example, the <i>gin2</i>-1 mutant reduces shoot and root growth, delays flowering, increases apical dominance, and alters sensitivity to auxin and cytokinin (<a href=\"#bib21\">Moore et al., 2003</a>). However, we did not observe an obvious juvenile-to-adult phase phenotype in the <i>gin2-</i>1 mutant under long day conditions (data not shown). Further studies will determine if the transcriptional repression of miR156 by sugar is mediated by the previously identified nuclear-localized HXK1-VHA-B1-RPT5B complex."

Since these sugars can be easily interconverted, it remains unclear whether the repression of miR156 is hexose or sucrose-dependent. Moreover, based on pharmacological treatment and mutant analyses, we show that sugar is able to trigger the degradation of <i>pri-MIR156A/C</i> independently of the canonical glucose sensor, HXK1. Thus, investigation of the molecular mechanism by which sugar in particular recognizes <i>pri-MIR156</i> and promotes their degradation is an important goal for future research."
