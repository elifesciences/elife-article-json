                    "text": "Despite their fundamental importance for body size regulation, the mechanisms that stop growth are poorly understood. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, growth ceases in response to a peak of the molting hormone ecdysone that coincides with a nutrition-dependent checkpoint, critical weight. Previous studies indicate that insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS)/Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling in the prothoracic glands (PGs) regulates ecdysone biosynthesis and critical weight. Here we elucidate a mechanism through which this occurs. We show that Forkhead Box class O (FoxO), a negative regulator of IIS/TOR, directly interacts with Ultraspiracle (Usp), part of the ecdysone receptor. While overexpressing FoxO in the PGs delays ecdysone biosynthesis and critical weight, disrupting FoxO\u2013Usp binding reduces these delays. Further, feeding ecdysone to larvae eliminates the effects of critical weight. Thus, nutrition controls ecdysone biosynthesis partially via FoxO\u2013Usp prior to critical weight, ensuring that growth only stops once larvae have achieved a target nutritional status."

                    "text": "Despite their fundamental importance for body size regulation, the mechanisms that stop growth are poorly understood. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, growth ceases in response to a peak of the molting hormone ecdysone that coincides with a nutrition-dependent checkpoint, critical weight. Previous studies indicate that insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS)/Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling in the prothoracic glands (PGs) regulates ecdysone biosynthesis and critical weight. Here we elucidate a mechanism through which this occurs. We show that Forkhead Box class O (FoxO), a negative regulator of IIS/TOR, directly interacts with Ultraspiracle (Usp), part of the ecdysone receptor. While overexpressing FoxO in the PGs delays ecdysone biosynthesis and critical weight, disrupting FoxO\u2013Usp binding reduces these delays. Further, feeding ecdysone to larvae eliminates the effects of critical weight. Thus, nutrition controls ecdysone biosynthesis partially via FoxO\u2013Usp prior to critical weight, ensuring that growth only stops once larvae have achieved a target nutritional status."

Koyama et al. found that, in the nucleus, the FoxO protein blocks the production of ecdysone by interacting with a protein that forms part of the ecdysone receptor. This protein complex delays the expression of genes that are involved in making the hormone.

Early in the third (final) larval instar (L3), a small peak of the steroid hormone ecdysone has been proposed to induce a developmental transition known as critical weight (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mirth and Riddiford, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mirth and Shingleton, 2012</a>). The critical weight ecdysone peak responds to both environmental cues and internal developmental processes. Environmental cues including nutrition, temperature and oxygen levels affect the timing of the critical weight ecdysone peak (<a href=\"#bib6\">Caldwell et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Colombani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mirth et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Callier et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ghosh et al., 2013</a>).

The combination of environmental and developmental regulation of this ecdysone peak ensures that developmental timing can be altered with changes in environmental conditions (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gibbens et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mirth and Shingleton, 2012</a>)."

The IIS/TOR pathway controls body size by regulating growth rate, and also by regulating the timing of critical weight to determine the duration of the growth period (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nijhout, 2003</a>). At critical weight, the IIS/TOR pathway acts directly on the glands that synthesize ecdysone, the prothoracic glands (PGs), to alter the timing of the expression of several cytochrome P450 (CYP450) genes necessary for ecdysone biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Colombani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Layalle et al., 2008</a>).

Since many CYP450 enzymes are involved in ecdysone biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gilbert et al., 2002</a>), this led us to the hypothesis that the effect of IIS/TOR signaling on ecdysone biosynthesis is mediated by the interaction between FoxO and either EcR or Usp."

However, these studies have not measured ecdysone concentrations with sufficient resolution early in the instar to show that ecdysone biosynthesis was delayed in starved pre-critical weight larvae. Therefore, we first examined whether this early ecdysone peak is delayed in starved larvae. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found that the small ecdysone peak that occurs around 10 hr after L3 ecdysis (AL3E) in well-fed larvae is suppressed in starved larvae, at least until 18 hr AL3E (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

To determine when wild type larvae reach critical weight, we starved carefully staged larvae of defined age classes on non-nutritive agar and measured the time it takes for them to reach pupariation from the onset of starvation. A hallmark of critical weight is that before it is attained starvation delays the onset of metamorphosis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beadle et al., 1938</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nijhout and Williams, 1974b</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mirth et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shingleton et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stieper et al., 2008</a>), whereas after critical weight larvae metamorphose early when starved. We estimate the age at critical weight using breakpoint analysis, which fits a bi-segmental linear regression to the relationship between age at starvation and time to pupariation, and calculates the age at critical weight as the inflection point where this relationship changes (<a href=\"#bib65\">Stieper et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ghosh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Testa et al., 2013</a>). We then use the linear relationship between larval weight and larval age to convert the age at which larvae reach critical weight to the size at which larvae reach critical weight (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Finally, we repeated the analysis on 1000 bootstrap datasets to generate 95% confidence intervals for the age and size of larvae when they reach critical weight. Data and scripts for the analysis of size and age at critical weight, including the growth rate data, for all genotypes and treatments are available from the Dryad Digital Repository: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.75940\">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.75940</a> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Koyama et al., 2014</a>)."

When we added the active form of ecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), to the medium even the youngest larvae no longer delayed their onset of metamorphosis when starved (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

We reasoned that if FoxO was involved in regulating ecdysone biosynthesis, FoxO would be present in the PG nuclei immediately after the molt to the L3 and would become progressively excluded from the nucleus as the larvae fed and approached critical weight. We found that FoxO was localized primarily in the nuclei of the PG cells of newly ecdysed L3 larvae (0 hr AL3E) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As the larvae fed, FoxO was gradually transported out of the nuclei into the cytoplasm. At 5 hr AL3E, FoxO appeared evenly dispersed inside the PG cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

To confirm that FoxO and Usp regulate critical weight by controlling the timing of ecdysone biosynthesis, we examined the expression of two CYP450 ecdysone biosynthetic genes, <i>phm</i> and <i>disembodied</i> (<i>dib</i>), known to be sensitive to IIS/TOR signaling (<a href=\"#bib11\">Colombani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Layalle et al., 2008</a>), in larvae with altered FoxO and Usp expression. In addition, we quantified the expression of an ecdysone response gene, <i>e74B</i> (<i>eip74ef isoform B</i>), which tracks the early effects of ecdysone signaling (<a href=\"#bib6\">Caldwell et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Colombani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Layalle et al., 2008</a>) in these larvae. In the parental controls, both <i>phm</i> and <i>dib</i> increased in expression around 8 hr AL3E, shortly before the critical weight ecdysone peak (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B,D,E</a>). <i>E74B</i> expression peaks around 12 hr in parental controls, after the critical weight ecdysone peak (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,F</a>). When both FoxO and Usp were overexpressed in the PGs, the increase in <i>phm</i> and <i>dib</i> expression was delayed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>) and <i>e74B</i> expression remained low up to 20 hr AL3E (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In contrast, when we knocked down FoxO and Usp, both <i>phm</i> and <i>dib</i> expression levels were high immediately after the molt to the L3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>) and <i>e74B</i> expression was nearly undetectable at ecdysis but increased rapidly thereafter (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>).

We created overlapping GST-tagged FoxO fragments and, using increasingly smaller overlapping fragments, we narrowed down the Usp binding region to a 35 amino acid region overlapping with 5 amino acids in the C-terminal end of the forkhead (DNA binding) domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This motif is well conserved across arthropod species including ticks and water fleas, but is not conserved in FoxO proteins in other ecdysozoans or vertebrates (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, this Usp binding motif is different from the well-known \u2018LXXLL\u2019-type NHR binding motif identified in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib29\">Heery et al., 1997</a>). Next, we identified eighteen candidate amino acids by comparing the crystal structure of mammalian FoxO3a to the <i>Drosophila</i> FoxO sequence (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tsai et al., 2007</a>) and selecting residues that occupied positions permissive for protein\u2013protein interactions. We mutated each of these to alanine. At least 4 of the 18 amino acid residues appeared to be involved in FoxO\u2013Usp binding (residues W172, N175, R202 and K204). When we introduced these single point mutations into the full length FoxO protein, they showed only mild reductions in FoxO\u2013Usp binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We then tested four double\u2013mutant combinations (W172-R202, W172-K204, N175-R202, and N175-K204) all of which were sufficient to dramatically reduce FoxO\u2013Usp interactions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Two of these double\u2013mutant combinations partially reduced the FoxO activity (W172-R202 and W172-K204) (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>), as determined by the expression of known FoxO targets InR and 4E-BP (<a href=\"#bib57\">Puig et al., 2003</a>). Because our aim was to disrupt FoxO\u2013Usp binding, but not FoxO function, these were excluded from further analyses. The remaining two double\u2013mutant combinations (N175-R202 or FoxO NR, and N175-K204 or FoxO NK) showed normal translocation to the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>) and did not affect FoxO's ability to regulate InR and 4E-BP promoter activities (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>, respectively)."

All three constructs have the same genetic background and differ only in the two amino acids mutated to interfere with FoxO\u2013Usp binding. We then drove expression of the FoxO, FoxO NR and FoxO NK in the wings, using the C765<i>-</i> and <i>MS1096-Gal4</i> drivers, and in the eyes, using the <i>eyeless (Ey)-</i> and <i>GMR-Gal4</i> drivers. For all drivers, overexpression of FoxO and FoxO NK reduced organ size to a similar degree (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

When we used the <i>Phm-Gal4</i> driver to overexpress FoxO in the PGs of <i>FoxO null</i> animals, most larvae did not survive to the L3. To circumvent this problem, we used <i>P0206-Gal4</i>, which expresses Gal4 moderately in the PGs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mirth et al., 2005</a>). Since <i>P0206</i>-<i>Gal4</i> driver expresses <i>Gal4</i> in other tissues such as the oenocytes and corpora allata, we tested the effects of overexpressing FoxO in these other tissues. To do this, we compared the duration of the L3 and final body size when overexpressing FoxO in the ring gland, oenocytes and corpora allata, using <i>P0206-Gal4</i>, in the oenocytes alone, using <i>PromE(800)</i>-<i>Gal4</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Billeter et al., 2009</a>), and in the corpora allata alone, using <i>Aug21</i>-<i>Gal4</i> (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mirth et al., 2005</a>) all in the <i>FoxO null</i> mutant background. We found that overexpressing FoxO in the oenocytes and corpora allata does not affect the duration of the L3. In contrast, overexpressing FoxO in the ring glands using <i>P0206-Gal4</i> prolonged the duration of the L3 compared to parental controls (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Further, overexpressing FoxO in the oenocytes and corpora allata did not affect final body size, whereas overexpressing FoxO using <i>P0206-Gal4</i> increased body size (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Taken together, our data suggest that FoxO overexpression in the oenocytes and corpora allata had no measurable effect on growth rate or the duration of the L3. Thus, we conclude that developmental delay and size increase induced by overexpressing FoxO using <i>P0206-Gal4</i> is due to the functions of FoxO in the PGs."

In the parental controls, larvae starved before 12 hr AL3E on ecdysone-supplemented agar did not delay the onset of metamorphosis, pupariating 36 hr after starvation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). When we starved <i>P0206</i>&gt;FoxO<i>, FoxO null</i> larvae on 20E supplemented agar, time to pupariation increased with age of starvation from 0\u201312 hr AL3E, with larvae showing a maximum time to pupariation of 57 hr (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) at 12 hr AL3E, then decreased thereafter.

Here, we demonstrated that FoxO associates with Usp to regulate nutrition-sensitive ecdysone biosynthesis.

We have found that interactions between FoxO and Usp regulate ecdysone biosynthesis, critical weight and body size. This allows us to propose a model for nutrition-sensitive ecdysone biosynthesis during critical weight (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). During the molt to the L3, larvae undergo a period of starvation while they expel their mouthparts (<a href=\"#bib55\">Park et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2003</a>). As a consequence, IIS/TOR signaling activity in the PGs is reduced and FoxO remains in the nucleus and forms a complex with Usp. The FoxO/Usp complex suppresses ecdysone biosynthesis at least in part by repressing transcription of <i>phm</i> and <i>dib,</i> although we do not know whether this repression is direct. Once larvae start feeding, increasing IIS/TOR activity in the PGs results in the phosphorylation of FoxO, causing the dissociation FoxO/Usp complexes as FoxO moves out of the nucleus. This progressive dissociation of FoxO/Usp complexes results in a gradual rise in ecdysone biosynthesis. Once ecdysone reaches a threshold, it triggers critical weight. Afterwards, the time to metamorphosis is set and can no longer be delayed by starvation. For other ecdysone peaks, a negative feedback loop induced by ecdysone signaling itself down-regulates ecdysone biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sakurai and Williams, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Takaki and Sakurai, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Moeller et al., 2013</a>).

As the larvae feed, FoxO becomes phosphorylated and transported out of the nucleus, thereby dissociating FoxO/Usp complexes. As a result, ecdysone biosynthesis becomes derepressed (upper right). After critical weight, ecdysone reduces its own biosynthesis through a negative-feedback loop. In starved conditions, the IIS/TOR signaling activity in the PGs remains low, thereby unphosphorylated FoxO remains inside of nuclei forming complexes with Usp (lower right). This inhibits ecdysone biosynthetic gene expression, thereby repressing ecdysone biosynthesis and delaying metamorphosis.

Ecdysone biosynthesis is also regulated by a developmental neuropeptide, prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH). Several extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli affect PTTH secretion, such as photoperiod, oxygen concentrations, signals released from damaged imaginal discs, and the sesquiterpenoid \u2018<i>status quo</i>\u2019 hormone juvenile hormone (<a href=\"#bib68\">Truman, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nijhout and Williams, 1974a</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">1974b</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">McBrayer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Halme et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Callier and Nijhout, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Colombani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Garelli et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mirth and Shingleton, 2012</a>). Activating downstream targets of PTTH signaling in the PGs accelerates the onset of metamorphosis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Caldwell et al., 2005</a>) and ablating the PTTH-producing cells delays critical weight (<a href=\"#bib42\">McBrayer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Rewitz et al., 2009</a>). Further, without PTTH the ecdysone peak that stimulates wandering behavior, where the larvae emerge from the food to begin metamorphosis, is dramatically delayed (<a href=\"#bib42\">McBrayer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Rewitz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gibbens et al., 2011</a>).

                                "text": "Our findings have broad implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of size regulation and the development of other environmentally-sensitive traits. In other insects, traits such as seasonal wing morphs in butterflies (<a href=\"#bib33\">Koch and B\u00fcckmann, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Koch et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Oostra et al., 2011</a>) or horn length in male dung beetles (<a href=\"#bib14\">Emlen and Nijhout, 1999</a>) arise from differential regulation of ecdysone biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Koyama et al., 2013</a>). Horn length in dung beetles is highly nutrition-dependent, with small, poorly-fed males bearing small horns and large, well-fed males having disproportionately larger horns (<a href=\"#bib13\">Emlen, 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">1997</a>). Small-horned males have a characteristic peak of ecdysone in their final instar absent in their well-fed, larger conspecifics (<a href=\"#bib14\">Emlen and Nijhout, 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2001</a>). Our data propose a mechanism through which nutrition, via FoxO\u2013Usp interactions, might regulate this peak (<a href=\"#bib35\">Koyama et al., 2013</a>)."

                                "text": "FoxO is also known to form complexes with many vertebrate NHRs, including thyroid hormone (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zhao et al., 2001</a>), androgen (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fan et al., 2007</a>) and estrogen receptors (<a href=\"#bib61\">Schuur et al., 2001</a>). The steroid sex hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen, are important for initiating puberty and the development of adult characters in humans. In girls, reaching a body mass of 48 kg determines the timing of first menses (<a href=\"#bib18\">Frisch and Revelle, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Freedman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gluckman and Hanson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmed et al., 2009</a>). Obese girls reach this mass faster, resulting in earlier onset of puberty (<a href=\"#bib17\">Freedman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gluckman and Hanson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmed et al., 2009</a>) possibly due to higher levels of insulin signaling (<a href=\"#bib9\">Codner and Cassorla, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lombardo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">von Berghes et al., 2011</a>). These findings suggest that IIS/TOR activity regulates the production of the steroid sex hormones to regulate developmental timing in vertebrates. Furthermore, two mammalian NHRs, CAR and PXR, associate with FoxO1 to regulate the expression of the CYP450 enzymes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kodama et al., 2004</a>). The similarity in the roles of FoxO/NHR complexes between mammals and insects provides a testable model that FoxO-NHR complexes regulate environmentally-sensitive development in a wide range of organisms."

We defined pupariation as cessation of movement with evaginated spiracles. All treatments were performed at 25\u00b0C under constant light to avoid the effect of circadian rhythm on PTTH secretion.

The P0206 driver used as a driver to express UAS-FoxO in the PG is also expressed in the CA and in oenocytes, which are known to regulate larval growth. The reviewers felt that it was important to use other drivers (Aug21 for the CA and the oenocyte 'specific\u201d driver PromE-GAL4 from Joel Levine) as additional controls. Although the P0206-GAL4 driver has been used in similar studies of critical weight, the authors note that phm-GAL4 driven expression of UAS-FoxO is lethal in FoxO mutants but not in control animals. This observation may indicate that the presence of FoxO in the peripheral tissues of control animals is modifying the phenotypic effects of PG-specific FoxO over-expression. Although the authors suggest that animals expressing P0206-FoxO are viable due to the moderate levels of FoxO expression, these animals could be surviving due to the presence of FoxO in oenocytes. Therefore, the observations described in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> could result from FoxO activity in either the oenocytes and not the PG or a synergistic interaction between these two tissues. The authors may address these problems with two simple experiments. Does oenocyte-specific expression of UAS-FoxO in a FoxO mutant delay the onset of pupariation? And, if so, is this delay 20E dependent? Finally, both of these Figures lack the necessary P0206-GAL4 negative control."

The experiments have been done very thoroughly (and often sensibly using a FoxO null background) but the main result is that the effects of UAS-FoxO NK upon critical age/weight, pupal weight, gene expression (e74B, dib, phm) and ecdysone tend to be INTERMEDIATE between controls and UAS-FoxO animals. This indicates that, at best, the FoxO-Usp interaction only makes a partial contribution towards the overall FoxO activity relevant to ecdysone gene repression. At worst, if general FoxO functions are compromised in the NK protein then the authors would not be demonstrating any specific in vivo role for Usp-FoxO interactions, simply that partially reducing the general activity of FoxO gives a hypomorphic phenotype. Therefore, the authors should examine the effects of FoxONK overexpression while simultaneously over expressing Usp. If the complex is truly important then coexpression of foxONK together with Usp should look just like foxONK. If however, Usp coexpression still augments the delay to critical weight, the result is more consistent for a role of Usp in CW determination that is independent of complex formation."

Since HR4 is proposed to negatively regulate biosynthetic enzymes prior to CW just like the FoxO/Usp complex proposed here, it would seem to me that this warrants significant mention. Are these two processes related or coordinated? Does HNR4 associate with FoxO? It would seem that at some level they have to be and this should be discussed."

The P0206 driver used as a driver to express UAS-FoxO in the PG is also expressed in the CA and in oenocytes, which are known to regulate larval growth. The reviewers felt that it was important to use other drivers (Aug21 for the CA and the oenocyte 'specific\u201d driver PromE-GAL4 from Joel Levine) as additional controls. Although the P0206-GAL4 driver has been used in similar studies of critical weight, the authors note that phm-GAL4 driven expression of UAS-FoxO is lethal in FoxO mutants but not in control animals. This observation may indicate that the presence of FoxO in the peripheral tissues of control animals is modifying the phenotypic effects of PG-specific FoxO over-expression. Although the authors suggest that animals expressing P0206-FoxO are viable due to the moderate levels of FoxO expression, these animals could be surviving due to the presence of FoxO in oenocytes. Therefore, the observations described in</i> <a href=\"#fig4\"><i>Figure 4A</i></a> <i>and</i> <a href=\"#fig6\"><i>Figure 6</i></a> <i>could result from FoxO activity in either the oenocytes and not the PG or a synergistic interaction between these two tissues.

And, if so, is this delay 20E dependent? Finally, both of these Figures lack the necessary P0206-GAL4 negative control</i>."

The experiments have been done very thoroughly (and often sensibly using a FoxO null background) but the main result is that the effects of UAS-FoxO NK upon critical age/weight, pupal weight, gene expression (e74B, dib, phm) and ecdysone tend to be INTERMEDIATE between controls and UAS-FoxO animals. This indicates that, at best, the FoxO-Usp interaction only makes a partial contribution towards the overall FoxO activity relevant to ecdysone gene repression. At worst, if general FoxO functions are compromised in the NK protein then the authors would not be demonstrating any specific</i> in vivo <i>role for Usp-FoxO interactions, simply that partially reducing the general activity of FoxO gives a hypomorphic phenotype. Therefore, the authors should examine the effects of FoxONK overexpression while simultaneously over expressing Usp. If the complex is truly important then coexpression of foxONK together with Usp should look just like foxONK. If however, Usp coexpression still augments the delay to critical weight, the result is more consistent for a role of Usp in CW determination that is independent of complex formation</i>."

Secondly, we explored whether FoxO NK overexpression reduced the size of tissues to the same extent as FoxO. FoxO NK significantly reduced the size of wings, and eyes, although not as much as FoxO.
