However, it is difficult to check for any bias in the peer-review process because the identity of peer reviewers generally remains confidential. Here, using public information about the identities of 9000 editors and 43000 reviewers from the Frontiers series of journals, we show that women are underrepresented in the peer-review process, that editors of both genders operate with substantial same-gender preference (homophily), and that the mechanisms of this homophily are gender-dependent. We also show that homophily will persist even if numerical parity between genders is reached, highlighting the need for increased efforts to combat subtler forms of gender bias in scholarly publishing."

However, it is difficult to check for any bias in the peer-review process because the identity of peer reviewers generally remains confidential. Here, using public information about the identities of 9000 editors and 43000 reviewers from the Frontiers series of journals, we show that women are underrepresented in the peer-review process, that editors of both genders operate with substantial same-gender preference (homophily), and that the mechanisms of this homophily are gender-dependent. We also show that homophily will persist even if numerical parity between genders is reached, highlighting the need for increased efforts to combat subtler forms of gender bias in scholarly publishing."

It is the \u201clifeblood of research in academia [\u2026] the social structure that subjects research to the critical assessment of other researchers\u201d (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bourdieu, 1975</a>). This structure relies on self-regulated interactions within the scientific community, in which a journal editor appoints peer reviewers with expertise in the subject of a particular manuscript to report on the quality of that manuscript and to provide recommendations for its improvement. Other attributes of the peer reviewer, such as their gender, should be irrelevant (<a href=\"#bib61\">Moss-Racusin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Nature, 2013</a>). However the identities of peer reviewers and editors are usually confidential, so previous work on gender balance in the peer-review process has relied on small, monodisciplinary data sets and these studies have given partly contradictory reports (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lloyd, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gilbert et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Budden et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Borsuk et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Knobloch-Westerwick et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Larivi\u00e8re et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Buckley et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Demarest et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Handley et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Fox et al., 2016</a>)."

This allowed us to extract the names of associate editors, peer reviewers and authors for articles published in Frontiers journals between 2007 (when the first Frontiers journal was published) and the end of 2015. This data set included the names of more than 9000 editors, 43,000 reviewers, and 126,000 authors for about 41,000 articles published in 142 journals in Science, Health, Engineering and the\u00a0Humanities and Social Sciences (see Materials and methods).

Moreover, our analysis suggests that this homophilic tendency will persist even when men and women are fairly represented in the peer-review process. Our results confirm the need for increased efforts to fight against subtler forms of gender bias in scholarly publishing and not just focus on numerical under-representation alone."

Since the start of the Frontiers journals in 2007 until 2015, women (circles) edit, review and author much less than 50% of manuscripts, as expected from their numeric underrepresentation. However, the actual numbers of reviewing and authoring contributions by women are even smaller than expected by chance, taking into account their numeric underrepresentation. This is revealed by comparison with a null hypothesis in which gender and number of contributions are assumed to be independent. To this end, we generated surrogate ensembles by shuffling the genders of scientists appearing in a given role in the network (<b>a<sub>2</sub></b>).

The unbalance between male and female contributions thus worsens when gradually ascending through the peer-review hierarchy. Apart from a few outlier countries, this pattern was dominant worldwide (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). It was also largely present in all the considered journals when looking at them individually (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). Overall, the number of contributions by female authors varies between about 15% (Frontiers in Neurorobotics) and 50% (Public Health), by female reviewers between about 15% (Surgery) and 50% (Public Health), and by female editors from ca. 5% (Robotics AI) to 35% (Aging Neuroscience). Globally, we observed a trend towards gender parity across time. The rates of change were, however, very slow. Linear extrapolation based on the fractions observed from 2012 to 2015 would predict that exact parity could be achieved as late as 2027 for authoring, 2034 for reviewing and 2042 for editing."

To test this hypothesis, we took the exact same network of peer-review interactions in the Frontiers journals for given, and randomly permuted gender labels among scientists of a given role (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a<sub>2</sub></a>). This procedure maintained the ratio of female and male scientists acting in the different roles, but destroyed all direct correlations between gender and numbers of contributions. Repeatedly drawing random genders for the scientists in the network generated a surrogate ensemble that we used to estimate the expected number of contributions in a gender-blind control network. Author and reviewing contributions by women lay significantly below the confidence intervals obtained through this permutation testing procedure since 2009 and 2011, respectively. For female editing contributions we found the same, though non-significant, trend. Thus, the mere overall smaller number of female actors cannot explain the observed unbalanced fractions of female contributions to the peer-review chain."

We here report four example disciplinary groupings, with large numbers of contributions (from left to right, respectively, 13416, 4721, 4020, 5680) and the propensity of appointing a female reviewer depending on the editor's gender for each of these groupings.

(<b>d</b>) Plotted here are distributions of a measure of inbreeding homophily. To control for baseline homophily at the level of a narrow local neighborhood, we measure, for each editor node, the actual number of reviewer assignments given to women and subtract the expected number, which would be observed if the considered editor appointed women with the same frequency as in his/her local vicinity. For male editors (green) the distribution is skewed towards an underrepresentation of female assignments (left-leaning), while for female editors the distribution is skewed towards an overrepresentation of female assignments.

We first checked for the influence of local subnetwork structure on apparent gender bias by looking at different scientific fields, including those with relatively mild underrepresentation of women, and found homophily widespread across disciplines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Second, a more detailed analysis of inter-node gender correlations in the editor-to-reviewer appointment network detected a clear tendency to gender homophily already at the level of the narrow neighborhood of individual nodes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). Specifically, to control for baseline homophily at the level of a narrow local neighborhood, we measured, for each editor node, the actual number of reviewer assignments given to women. We then subtracted from this number its chance expectation, derived individually for every node from the frequency of <i>locally reachable</i> female reviewers, i.e. reviewers situated at most five links away (which is a short distance relative to the average shortest path length of 12 steps for the editor-to-reviewer network, cf <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>).

Both independent analyses \u2013\u00a0by topic or localized\u00a0\u2013 validate the existence of a so-called \u201cinbreeding\u201d homophily, i.e. an active preference to connect with same-gender network nodes, on top of \u201cbaseline\u201d homophily (<a href=\"#bib57\">McPherson et al., 2001</a>)."

To that end, we defined an index of inbreeding\u00a0homophily at the local level of each editor node. For each considered editor node, we first evaluated the number <i>k</i> of connected same-gender reviewers. We then evaluated the probability 0 \u2264 <i>\u03a6</i><sub>hom</sub>\u00a0\u2264 1 that <i>k</i> (or more) homophilic connections could arise by baseline homophily only, taking into account the editor-specific basin of locally reachable male and female reviewers (defined as for <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). Such <i>\u03a6</i><sub>hom</sub> can serve as an index tracking the strength of inbreeding homophily in shaping the actual reviewer appointments by an editor. Large values of <i>\u03a6</i><sub>hom</sub> approaching 1 indicate that the observed gender homophilic choices of a given editor are plausibly just due to \u201cpassive\u201d baseline homophily. In contrast, small values of <i>\u03a6</i><sub>hom</sub> approaching 0 hint at a stronger tendency to \u201cactive\u201d \u2013\u00a0consciously or unconsciously, see Discussion\u00a0\u2013 inbreeding homophily. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a> shows the histograms of the index <i>\u03a6</i><sub>hom</sub> for male and female editors, compared with expectations from gender-shuffled networks.

On the one hand, we found that it was enough to remove the few most homophilic female editors with the lowest values of <i>\u03a6</i><sub>hom</sub> from the network, to bring the probability for a female editor to appoint a female reviewer back to chance-level. On the other hand, the probability for a male editor to appoint a female reviewer increased only very slowly by pruning more and more male editors. In particular, it remained significantly below chance expectations for all the considered thresholds for inclusion, 0 \u2264 <i>\u03a6</i><sub>thr</sub> \u2264 0.5. This means that the overall smaller-than-chance probability of appointing female reviewers for male editors is due to inbreeding homophilic tendencies that are <i>widespread among male editors</i>, although at varying degrees of strength. In contrast, the overall larger-than-chance probability to appoint female reviewers for female editors is driven by the action of just a <i>small number of strongly homophilic female editors</i>, with most other female editors showing only \u201cpassive\u201d baseline homophily."

                                "text": "What could be the reasons for the remaining inequity? It has been argued that underrepresentation of women in science may be due to conscious career choices by female researchers (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ceci et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ceci and Williams, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2011</a>), even if it is not clear to which extent these choices are really free or rather constrained by society. Previous studies reported that, measured by their number of publications, women are generally less productive than men (<a href=\"#bib21\">Cole and Zuckerman, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Zuckerman, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Long and Fox, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Xie and Shauman, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Pan and Kalinaki, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Caplar et al., 2016</a>) and it has been suggested (<a href=\"#bib95\">Xie and Shauman, 1998</a>) that this might be due to personal characteristics, structural positions, and marital status. Moreover, the fraction of female scientists decreases with rank or age (<a href=\"#bib29\">ETAN Expert Working Group on Women and Science,\u00a02000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ley and Hamilton, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Goulden et al., 2011</a>) and this shorter career length might contribute to the drop of female-to-male ratio for a high number of contributions. Nevertheless, women who persevere longer in their career despite obstacles are highly performing. While the productivity of young publishing female scientists in Germany was 10% lower than that of their male counterparts, the discrepancy reduced to just 3% for more senior scientists (<a href=\"#bib73\">Pan and Kalinaki, 2015</a>). Also, it has been reported that women with children are not less productive than those without (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hamovitch and Morgenstern, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Cole, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Cole and Zuckerman, 1987</a>), although young children might decrease productivity (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kyvik, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kyvik and Teigen, 1996</a>). The low number of women among senior scientists might be particularly detrimental for a gender-neutral evaluation of scientific work, as the implicit association of \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cscience\u201d is strongest in the group of 40-65 year olds (<a href=\"#bib69\">Nosek et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, declining an invitation to review is often due to a lack of time (<a href=\"#bib85\">Tite and Schroter, 2007</a>) and it is possible that female scientists spend more time with duties beyond research (e.g. teaching, mentoring, service;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib29\">ETAN Expert Working Group on Women and Science,\u00a02000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Knapp, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Misra et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, a compensating factor seems to be that female editors, in contrast to authors, have been reported to be more productive than male editors (<a href=\"#bib35\">Gilbert et al., 1994</a>). Interestingly, men and women who are invited to review a manuscript have very similar propensities to accept the invitation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Fox et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lerback and Hanson, 2017</a>), suggesting: (1) that simply increasing the number of invitations to female reviewers would have a direct and proportional effect; and, (2) that the low number of female reviews in our data is caused in part by a lower number of invitations."

It can therefore serve as a benchmark for gender-composition among authors.

Given uncertainties in determining a person's gender these numbers are comparable. Broken down by country, we find overall similar fractions of female authors, although, for some countries, the relative deviations can rise up to 29% (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

Many previous studies (cf. <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>) were self-diagnoses performed by editorial boards of the corresponding journal and, as a consequence, tended to be based on mono-disciplinary data of relatively small sample size. Larger sample sizes, but limited to editors, were considered in an analysis of the composition of editorial boards of 435 mathematical journals (<a href=\"#bib86\">Topaz and Sen, 2016</a>). Only 9% of editors were women. Other reported numbers for the fraction of women editors in journals of different disciplines range from 38% to 54% (cf. <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). These numbers lie at the lower and upper end of the female editor fractions across the Frontiers journals, ranging between 6% (Frontiers in Robotics and AI) and 37% (Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience), with an average of 28%. Concerning female reviewers or female reviewer appointments, fractions reported in the literature range between 16% and 48% (cf. <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), to be compared with the range between 11% and 48% for the Frontiers journals with an average of 30%. Concerning female authors, <a href=\"#bib73\">Pan and Kalinaki (2014)</a> report fractions ranging from 15% in computer science to 57% in veterinary science. These numbers are once again comparable to female author fractions in Frontiers journals, ranging from 17% (Neurorobotics) to 48% (Public Health). Overall, our study provides thus a global account on the prevalence of women among editors and reviewers and ranks previous reports in a continuum of field-specific participation numbers.

This\u00a0study reports information about aspects that our study could not have access to, breaking down women\u2019s underrepresentation by age and showing that the decline rate for invited reviews is only slightly smaller for women than men. Overall, relative fractions of female participation reported by this study are compatible with numbers we found for the journal Frontiers in Earth Science, with e.g. a matching female reviewer appointments fraction close to 20%, suggesting that women play a larger role in other fields compared to that report (cf. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). For the AGU journals the authors conclude that editors, especially male ones, appoint too few female reviewers. Male editors\u2019 behavior in that study thus agrees with our findings for the entirety of Frontiers journals, while we find an opposite trend for female editors. We note here that <a href=\"#bib51\">Lerback and Hanson (2017)</a> reached their conclusion of women\u2019s underrepresentation by comparing actual reviewer appointment numbers to the fraction of female first authors. This comparison, however, might be questionable, because reviewers in low age groups are rarely invited by editors (3% of times) whereas first authors tend to be young. To account for such differences, we determined expectation levels by gender shuffling among the reviewers and editors in the fixed network of actual reviewer-editor interactions and find that the fraction of female authors (the expectation value that Lerback and Hanson used) is much higher than the expected number of female reviewer contributions (our expectation value; cf. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1b</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3a</a>). For that reason, Lerback and Hanson may have quantitatively overestimated the female editors\u2019 bias against female reviewer appointments. Still, despite this overestimation, even Lerback and Hanson reported female editors\u2019 preference for female reviewers for certain age classes (although not commented upon)."

While homophily can in principle be put to good use, as for instance in the education about good health practices (<a href=\"#bib20\">Centola, 2011</a>), the uncontrolled effects of homophily may constitute a threat to the universalism of the peer-review system, and thus to science."

After removal of their contribution, homophily became insignificant (cf. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e,f</a>). This suggests that there is only baseline homophily for the majority of female editors and most assignments are gender-blind (for instance in the neuroscience community, cf. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s homophily patterns are classically known, finding their root in different styles of social network construction. For instance, in situations where a mutual friendship exists between A and B a friendship initiation with C tends to be reciprocated by boys, but not by girls (<a href=\"#bib28\">Eder and Hallinan, 1978</a>). Such differences in attachment strategies tend to generate gender-segregated worlds for children to preadolescents in which girls evolve in small homogeneous groups and boys form larger but more heterogeneous cliques, with boundaries made looser only later by romantic ties (<a href=\"#bib81\">Shrum et al., 1988</a>). Professional social networks of men are more homophilic than women\u2019s, especially in work environments in which men are dominant (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brass, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ibarra, 1992</a>). Another source of asymmetry may be that both men and women tend to form connection routes passing through a male node when reaching toward distant domains (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aldrich, 1989</a>)."

Multiple categories of relationships were analyzed, for instance, by <a href=\"#bib42\">Ibarra (1992)</a> who reported that, in a company setting, men named mostly men as points of contact for five different business-relationship categories, whereas for women the preferred gender was category-dependent. A similar situation could be at work here: one could speculate that a set of other, hidden, variables influence reviewer appointment decisions, and that these variables have a different importance for male and female editors. Determining which factors are most important for male and female editors in the choice of the reviewer and how these factors are or are not, in principle, related to gender, might thus aid in reducing homophily in the peer-review system."

Now, while the active engagement of these femocrats is very useful in pushing forward technocratic (i.e. top-down) solutions aiming at reducing gender\u00a0discriminations, especially at an early stage, on the long-term, the effects of their action may be precarious. Indeed political experiences have shown that when an external event reduces the influence of these isolated driver women, the situation can quickly deteriorate again (<a href=\"#bib71\">Outshoorn, 2005</a>), aggravated by the suspicious look toward femocrats held by formerly dominant men or, paradoxically, even women, finding them too prone to compromise or too aggressive (<a href=\"#bib70\">Outshoorn and Kantola, 2007</a>). It is thus important to devise strategies \u2018healing\u2019 network topology in depth, and in a bottom-up fashion, via pervasive education campaigns targeted to the deciders (<a href=\"#bib79\">Sainsbury, 1994</a>), in our case chiefly the editors.

A scientist's status and the provision of resources to scientists should not be influenced by gender but solely depend on the value of the scientific contributions. Access to the publication systems is a critical determinant of a scientist\u2019s success. Accordingly, reviewers and editors, the gatekeepers of the scientific canon, should be particularly sensitive to base their judgment solely on the merit of scientific work. This merit, however, is difficult to determine and any assessment is necessarily influenced by the assessor's view of the field, including his or her personal position in the network of colleagues and the interactions with them (<a href=\"#bib62\">Mulkay, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Cole, 1992</a>)."

It is only natural, thus, that we find gender homophily in interactions between editors, reviewers and authors. Nonetheless, this inbreeding homophily is damaging to female scientists, whose work ends up being overlooked, due to unconscious negative bias. The phenomenon of inbreeding homophily is also likely not restricted to the peer\u00a0review of manuscripts, so it needs to be taken into account for grant evaluation, hiring, or when designing mentoring programs. Importantly, it is likely to persist even when numerical balance between genders is achieved (<a href=\"#bib43\">Isbell et al., 2012</a>). Altogether, inbreeding homophily negatively affects science as a whole because a stronger involvement of women would increase the quality of scientific output (<a href=\"#bib59\">Merton, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Woolley et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Nature, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Campbell et al., 2013</a>).

On the other hand, fast progress could be attempted through \u201ctop-down\u201d implementation of technocratic instruments such as quota.

As inbreeding homophily is an expression of a state of mind it is likely little amenable to change by externally enforced measures. Raising awareness, in comparison, seems to be the most promising route. The goal should be to motivate all scientific actors to \u201cintegrate thinking about gender discrimination in every decisional process\u201d (translated from <a href=\"#bib93\">Woodward, 2008</a>). Educative actions should be conducted with tact, not based uniquely on inducing feeling of guilt and shame, in order not to be perceived as annoying (<a href=\"#bib92\">Woodward, 2003</a>).

Second, while removal of the authors\u2019 names does indeed blind the reviewers to all irrelevant attributes, it also blinds them to relevant meta-data, such as the scientific experience of the authors, which might be considered as relevant by many reviewers. In an attempt to assist editors of Frontiers journals, keyword-based reviewer suggestions are automatically provided to them but the editors remain free to make their own choices. While these gender-blind automated suggestions could already contribute to an assignment that is less influenced by homophily, an editorial management software is also the ideal platform to routinely direct the editor\u2019s attention to the issue of homophily. It could display statistics similar to our <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and encourage non-homophilic choices of reviewers. Such a strategy maintains full editorial freedom and could easily be evaluated, either internally or, in the case of open review as in the Frontiers journals, through analysis of the publicly available data."

In the remaining cases, we decided whether a record matched another based on the names and affiliations of people. Specifically, for two names to be matched, we required that the surnames coincided and that each given name of the contributor with less given names needed to have a corresponding match in the other contributor's name (a match could also be an initial like \u201cJ\u201d with a fully specified name like \u201cJohn\u201d). In case both contributors' given names consisted of only initials, we required, in addition, that their affiliations were sufficiently similar. <a href=\"#bib68\">Newman (2001)</a> found that name-matching in the absence of UIDs, and even abbreviating all given names to initials, resulted in errors on the order of few percent in a data set comprising more than a million people.

Besides this discussion, we also performed a more detailed analysis of the different prevalence of homophily in the male and female subpopulation. Taken together we feel that the data clearly point to same-gender preference of mostly male editors as a contribution to the under-representation of female scientists across the Frontiers series of journals. This conclusion is particularly strengthened by our new analysis of the different patterns of gender homophily for male and female editors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>-f)."

Independent of the error rate, we would like to stress that mis-assigning gender can never increase the homophily that we see. Random mis-assignments have the same effect as a small rate of random permutation of gender labels. This would reduce evidence for inbreeding homophily rather than spuriously inducing it Thus, although we cannot reach a 100% correct gender assignment, the finding of inbreeding homophily is robust against this type of uncertainty."
