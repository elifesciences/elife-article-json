Purified MAVS CARD from culture cells self-assembles into filaments. Previously, we reported a low-resolution cryoEM structure of MAVS CARD filament, which exhibits a C3 symmetry with a rotation of \u221253.6\u00b0 and an axial rise of 16.8 \u00c5 for every unit in the filament (<a href=\"#bib10\">Xu et al., 2014</a>). Recently, a cryoEM reconstruction of MAVS CARD filaments at 3.6 \u00c5 resolution was reported with a C1 helical symmetry of a rotation of \u2212101.1\u00b0 and an axial rise of 5.1 \u00c5 per subunit (<a href=\"#bib9\">Wu et al., 2014</a>). The differences in these two models were carefully analyzed recently (<a href=\"#bib3\">Egelman, 2014</a>), which suggested that the helical ambiguity in helical reconstruction was not fully resolved in our previous analysis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Xu et al., 2014</a>). We recently collected a new dataset at higher resolutions. Using a newly developed method for analysis of helical filaments (<a href=\"#bib1\">Clemens et al., 2015</a>), we obtained a 4.2 \u00c5 resolution reconstruction of MAVS CARD filaments purified from mammalian cells under native conditions. The new model shows that the MAVS CARD filament exhibits a C1 helical symmetry in agreement with <a href=\"#bib9\">Wu et al. (2014)</a>."

Fourier transforms of motion-corrected raw images showed Thon rings up to \u223c3 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). After CTF fitting, the selected raw images were phase-flipped, and individual filaments were selected interactively using EMAN2 Helixboxer (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ludtke et al., 1999</a>). Selected filaments were segmented using individual boxes that had 90% overlap between neighboring ones. Segmented filament images were high-pass filtered at 120 \u00c5 to suppress the low-resolution variations in optical density across individual images as well as the contribution of low-resolution noise to particle alignment. The filament datasets were processed using a customized version of Relion 1.2 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Scheres, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Clemens et al., 2015</a>). This \u2018helical\u2019 Relion implemented the Iterative Helical Real Space Reconstruction (IHRSR) method (<a href=\"#bib2\">Egelman, 2010</a>) within the framework of Relion 1.2. For 3D classification and auto-refinement, the helical symmetry was refined by the re-implemented IHRSR module <i>hsearch</i> and applied in real space to the 3D volume by the re-implemented IHRSR module <i>himpose</i>. The helically symmetrized volume was masked and used as the reference volume in the next iteration (<a href=\"#bib1\">Clemens et al., 2015</a>)."

Reference models of C1 and C3 symmetries were calculated from our SPIDER-based analysis using sorted fractions of filament particles from the four datasets in our previous paper (<a href=\"#bib10\">Xu et al., 2014</a>). They were filtered to 60 \u00c5 and then refined against the new dataset in helical Relion. We found that the new dataset converged better to the C1 symmetry. To reduce model bias, we also calculated a reconstruction by imposing the C1 symmetry for the first five runs of refinement to a C3 model obtained from our original analysis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Xu et al., 2014</a>). The initial C1 symmetry parameters of a twist angle (\u0394\u03a6) = \u2212101.25\u00b0 and an axial rise (\u0394z) = 4.75 \u00c5 (from our old datasets and adjusted to 4.95 \u00c5 due to the change of the imaging system) were derived from the corresponding selection rule defined by indexing the power spectrum. After the fifth run, the refinement was continued to optimize the helical parameters and converged to (\u0394\u03a6 = \u2212101.21\u00b0 and \u0394z = 5.06 \u00c5) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), close to the C1 symmetry reported by <a href=\"#bib9\">Wu et al.

To examine the resolution with an independent method, we generated a B-factor weighted map based on the PDB model from <a href=\"#bib9\">Wu et al.

The heterogeneity of the samples and the limited resolution of images were likely among the factors that led to the exclusion of the C1 model in the original analysis. We wish to correct this mistake and apologize for any confusion it might have caused. We stand by all other data in the paper, including in vitro mapping of the oligomerization interface, cell-based mutational analyses, super-resolution SIM imaging of MAVS aggregates in virus-infected cells, and the crystal structures. These experiments for the first time identified most of the key residues involved in MAVS polymerization, leading to an extensive mapping of the molecular surfaces for forming the MAVS filament."

The microscope was equipped with a Cs corrector (Cs = 0.01 mm) and operated at 300 kV. EPU (FEI) was run to control automatic data collection across multiple preselected holes in the holey grids. Images were taken using a defocus range of \u22122.5 to \u22124.0 microns at a nominal magnification of 59,000\u00d7, which corresponds to a calibrated pixel size of 1.05 \u00c5 at the specimen level. Images were taken with a total dose of 35 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> distributed over 16 frames. The movie data were processed using the program dosefgpu_driftcorr (<a href=\"#bib5\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Frames 3\u201312 of every movie were summed together as the corrected image (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The carbon-support of our filaments made the motion between consecutive frames very small (mostly less than 2 pixels) and we therefore did not do motion correction for individual filaments (polishing) in Relion. We started with 27,916 filaments. After 2D classification, 15,600 filaments were selected. During the 3D classification into two different classes, there was a negligible fraction of the filaments conforming to a different volume with poor alignment statistics. We therefore kept all 15,600 filaments for final map calculation, which correspond to \u223c80,000 images of individual CARD units."

Two separate C1 models were generated using the SPIDER-based method from a small sorted fraction (\u223c13%) of filaments out of our old datasets as described before (<a href=\"#bib10\">Xu et al., 2014</a>), and imposed with diagonally varied symmetry parameters (5.22 \u00c5, \u2212102.2\u00b0) and (4.82 \u00c5, \u2212100.2\u00b0), respectively. These two models were used as initial models and separately refined against the two half datasets in helical Relion. The two refinements converged to almost the same symmetry parameters, (5.05 \u00c5, \u2212101.25\u00b0) and (5.08 \u00c5, \u2212101.20\u00b0), respectively.

The map calculated from the top half of the dataset was rotated \u22122.4\u00b0 and shifted by \u22121.05 pixels before being compared with the one from the bottom half to calculate a gold-standard FSC using e2proc3d.py in EMAN2. The calculations in the final refinement steps were done in the <i>largemem</i> nodes of the STAMPEDE supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computer Center (TACC) in Austin, Texas.

We thank Mr Mohammed Sayed in the Jiang lab for his help in selecting the filaments out of EM images. Q-XJ is indebted to Dr Hernando Sosa (Albert Einstein) for discussions of and help in Fourier-Bessel indexing of the power spectra, and to Drs David DeRosier (Brandeis University), Fred Sigworth (Yale University) and Anthony Crowther (MRC LMB) for their comments and suggestions on the parallel sorting of the datasets against different models."
