Our transcription start sites (TSSs) analysis of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells deficient for RNA degradation pathways revealed that about half of the pervasive transcripts are degraded by NMD, which provides a fail-safe mechanism to remove spurious transcripts that escaped degradation in the nucleus. Moreover, we found that the low specificity of RNA polymerase II TSSs selection generates, for 47% of the expressed genes, NMD-sensitive transcript isoforms carrying uORFs or starting downstream of the ATG START codon. Despite the low abundance of this last category of isoforms, their presence seems to constrain genomic sequences, as suggested by the significant bias against in-frame ATGs specifically found at the beginning of the corresponding genes and reflected by a depletion of methionines in the N-terminus of the encoded proteins."

Our transcription start sites (TSSs) analysis of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells deficient for RNA degradation pathways revealed that about half of the pervasive transcripts are degraded by NMD, which provides a fail-safe mechanism to remove spurious transcripts that escaped degradation in the nucleus. Moreover, we found that the low specificity of RNA polymerase II TSSs selection generates, for 47% of the expressed genes, NMD-sensitive transcript isoforms carrying uORFs or starting downstream of the ATG START codon. Despite the low abundance of this last category of isoforms, their presence seems to constrain genomic sequences, as suggested by the significant bias against in-frame ATGs specifically found at the beginning of the corresponding genes and reflected by a depletion of methionines in the N-terminus of the encoded proteins."

In human cells, roughly 75% of the genome gives rise to RNA transcripts of various length but only an estimated 2% corresponds to protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Djebali et al., 2012</a>). Even in a compact genome such as the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (<i>S. cerevisiae</i>), hundreds of such pervasive non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) were identified in addition to the stable ncRNAs such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (sn(o)RNAs), and ribosomal RNA (rRNAs) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Neil et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Xu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">van Dijk et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Geisler et al., 2012</a>)."

Different mechanisms of RNA quality control prevent their accumulation in wild-type cells. In the nucleus, transcription from bidirectional promoters is restricted by early termination-coupled RNA degradation pathways (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arigo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Thiebaut et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Almada et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ntini et al., 2013</a>). In the yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, degradation-coupled transcription termination of pervasive transcripts relies on the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, which interacts with the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) phosphorylated on serine 5 and triggers termination upon recognition of short sequences on the nascent RNA (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arigo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Thiebaut et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gudipati et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Vasiljeva et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Schulz et al., 2013</a>). Early termination of these transcripts (named CUTs for cryptic unstable transcripts) is coupled with the recruitment of the Trf4-Air2-Mtr4 (TRAMP) complex and the Rrp6-containing nuclear RNA-exosome for rapid degradation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wyers et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Davis and Ares, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tudek et al., 2014</a>). However, a significant proportion of the pervasive transcripts can escape this early nuclear quality-control step and be exported to the cytoplasm where they are targeted for degradation by the cytoplasmic 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease Xrn1 (XUT; <a href=\"#bib47\">van Dijk et al., 2011</a>). Some pervasive transcripts seem to be immune enough to both surveillance pathways to be detectable in wild-type cells and are called SUTs (stable unannotated transcripts; <a href=\"#bib52\">Xu et al., 2009</a>). The distinction between these different classes of transcripts is not very stringent. Their behavior can be similar, as illustrated by the fact that in the absence of Xrn1p the average levels of SUTs and CUTs increase by 7.9-fold and 3.6-fold respectively (<a href=\"#bib47\">van Dijk et al., 2011</a>). What makes pervasive transcripts (XUTs in the first instance) highly sensitive to Xrn1p-dependent cytoplasmic degradation remains to be determined but may be linked to the presence of small spurious open reading frames (ORF) in these transcripts that will make them substrates for the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) as has been recently demonstrated for a new class of unannotated transcripts (<a href=\"#bib41\">Smith et al., 2014</a>)."

Although NMD targets were previously analysed genome-wide using NMD-deficient strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the techniques used to perform these analyses (<a href=\"#bib18\">He et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kawashima et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Smith et al., 2014</a>) did not allow monitoring such individual transcript isoforms and were thus susceptible to have missed a large number of transcripts degraded by this pathway. In order to address this question in a global and systematic manner, we used a modified 5\u2032-RACE approach (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hashimoto et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</a>) to perform a genome-wide analysis of TSSs in wild-type <i>S. cerevisiae</i> cells as well as in cells deficient for nuclear and NMD RNA quality-control pathways. Minor transcript isoforms targeted for degradation by NMD were identified for almost half of yeast protein-coding genes, underscoring the low specificity of TSS selection by RNAPII. In particular, our study revealed for the majority of protein-coding genes the use of TSSs downstream the ATG start codons. This phenomenon has the potential to generate N-terminally truncated proteins if the first ATG encountered by ribosomes translating this 5\u2032 truncated transcript is in the right reading frame. Such an undesirable outcome seems, however, to be counteracted by the significant depletion of in-frame relative to out-of-frame ATGs at the beginning of protein-coding genes in yeast. This bias increases the probability of such transcripts to have very short coding regions and be efficiently degraded by NMD."

This includes not only a large fraction of the XUTs and SUTs but also a fraction of the CUTs and previously unannotated transcripts, which accumulate to substantial levels only when both pathways are inactive."

We evaluated the \u2018false-discovery\u2019 rate of the method for the identification of TSSs (that is, the proportion of sequencing reads not actually mapping to the 5\u2032-end of capped RNAs) by comparing libraries made using samples treated or not with the tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP), which is required for efficient and specific ligation of the biotinylated primer to the 5\u2032-end of capped-RNAs. To extend this analysis to transcripts that are unstable in wild-type cells, we prepared libraries using RNAs extracted from <i>upf1\u2206rrp6\u2206</i> double mutant strains. To minimize polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification biases and provide an internal control, the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNAs, treated or not with TAP, were mixed with an equal amount of TAP-treated poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNAs from <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> just prior to the ligation step. After normalization using the <i>S. pombe</i> sequencing reads and removal of the ribosomal DNA ones, these experiments generated 2,844,877 reads when TAP was used compared with 72,435 reads when TAP was omitted. The ratio between these two numbers provides an upper limit for the false-discovery rate of TSS identification of 2.5%. Analysis of the cumulative 5\u2032-end read counts per nucleotide around the start codon for all protein-coding genes showed that, genome-wide, 77% (2,190,211) of the reads obtained for TAP-treated samples could be mapped within a 200 nucleotide region upstream of the start codons with a maximum at around 30 nucleotides upstream from ATGs, while only 22% mapped to the same region when this treatment was omitted (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, even in the latter case, the number of mapped reads also peaked at around 30 nucleotides upstream of the ATGs, suggesting that a substantial proportion of these sequences likely correspond to genuine TSSs even though they were generated in the absence of TAP treatment. These data suggest that the real false-discovery rate for TSS is substantially less than 2.5%."

A strong percentage of mismatches (\u223c60%) was observed specifically for the first cDNA position when pyrimidines are encoded on the genome at the corresponding location. In 80% of the cases, these mismatches consisted of a pyrimidine to A mismatch. (<b>C</b>) As in (<b>A</b>) but taking into account only the TSSs for which a pyrimidine to A mismatch at the 5\u2032-end of the cDNAs was observed. The vertical arrows pointing to an A indicate the fact that the +1 nucleotide position, a pyrimidine in the genome, corresponds to a mismatched A at the first position of the cDNA. Up to 30% of the cDNA 5\u2032-ends mapping on a pyrimidine actually conform to this consensus. Note that the presence of a conserved A at position \u22127 while it is located at position \u22128 in the general consensus and the presence of the pyrimidine to A mismatch suggests that transcription may not start at the pyrimidine but rather at the following A. Indeed, if one would remove the base at the 5\u2032-end of the cDNA reads and align these to the genome, they would then perfectly conform to the general consensus, including the A at position \u22128, suggesting that an extra A is added at the 5\u2032-end of the transcript during its synthesis. (<b>D</b>) Schematic model depicting how a one nucleotide \u2018backward-shift\u2019 relative to the template occurring during the transcription of the first three consecutive As might lead to the incorporation of four As at the beginning of the transcript. This scenario is supported by the fact that for TSSs mapped at PyAAA sequences, the corresponding transcripts carried three or four As at about equal frequencies, which suggests that this \u2018one nucleotide back-shifting\u2019 phenomenon occurs about half of the time when transcription initiates on this particular motif."

Analysis of the TSSs and their surrounding sequences using the Web-LOGO algorithm (<a href=\"#bib7\">Crooks et al., 2004</a>) identified a consensus sequence around TSSs (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) similar to the previously reported one derived from a smaller data set (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang and Dietrich, 2005</a>). In particular, we observed a very strong bias to start at a purine (88% of mapped TSSs), usually following a pyrimidine (76% of the mapped TSSs), and the enrichment for an A at position \u22128 relative to the TSS (A(N)<sub>6</sub>Py<span class=\"underline\">Pu</span> consensus). Surprisingly, 58% of TSS reads starting with a pyrimidine when aligned on the genome (12% of the mapped TSSs) show a mismatch at their first nucleotide, most of the time an A instead of the encoded pyrimidine (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Moreover, in 32% of these cases the surrounding genomic sequences exhibited a specific consensus, A(N)<sub>6</sub><span class=\"underline\">Py</span>AAA (where the underlined base is the mapped TSS; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). These observations suggest that, in these cases, transcription actually initiates on the A following the pyrimidine and that an additional A is added at the 5\u2032-end of the transcript, possibly by a back-tracking mechanism as proposed in the model described in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>. This may also apply to other TSSs mapped on a pyrimidine and showing a mismatched first nucleotide. It thus appears from this observation that, even though 12% of the TSSs mapped on a pyrimidine, transcription initiation actually occurred on a pyrimidine in less than 5% of cases (42% of non-mismatched cDNAs out of 12% of cDNAs aligned on a pyrimidine)."

In contrast, only 23% of the CUT-TSSCs increased significantly in the absence of Upf1. The opposite situation was observed for XUTs and SUTs, which were more sensitive to the cytoplasmic NMD quality-control pathway (28% vs 52% significantly stabilized in the absence of Rrp6 or Upf1, respectively; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Collectively, 39% and 54% of the pervasive transcripts (CUTs, SUTs and XUTs) were significantly sensitive to the absence of Upf1 in a wild-type or <i>rrp6\u2206</i> background, respectively, indicating that NMD targets about half of the pervasive transcripts. The absence of both Rrp6 and Upf1 had an additive effect on the stabilization of pervasive transcripts. In the double mutant, 76% and 92% of the XUTs/SUTs and CUTs, respectively, were significantly stabilized, suggesting that NMD provides a fail-safe control mechanism for pervasive transcripts that escaped degradation in the nucleus, reminiscent of what has been previously shown for some unspliced pre-mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sayani and Chanfreau, 2012</a>)."

We tested this hypothesis by performing northern blot hybridization for three XUTs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and genome-wide transcriptome analyses of wild-type, <i>upf1\u2206</i>, <i>xrn1\u2206</i>, and <i>upf1\u2206xrn1\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>). Since the absence of Xrn1 leads to the accumulation of decapped RNAs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hsu and Stevens, 1993</a>), we could not use the TSS sequencing methodology applied for the other mutants and we thus used, for this particular experiment, a classical RNA sequencing approach for transcript quantification (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Moreover, since the absence of Xrn1 affects the overall cellular mRNA content (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sun et al., 2013</a>), an aliquot of a <i>S. pombe</i> culture was added to the cell pellet before RNA extraction to provide an independent internal control for normalization of the results. After having verified that the overall quantifications with \u2018RNAseq\u2019 gave results similar to those obtained by TSS sequencing for the wild-type and <i>upf1</i>\u2206 strains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), we used the former technique to analyse the genome-wide effect of the <i>XRN1</i> deletion. Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib47\">van Dijk et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sun et al., 2013</a>), deletion of <i>XRN1</i> resulted in a global increase of mRNAs, XUTs and SUTs compared with the wild-type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). In contrast to mRNAs, the extent to which XUTs and SUTs were stabilized in <i>xrn1\u2206</i> was very similar to the one observed in <i>upf1\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Furthermore, deleting <i>XRN1</i> in an <i>upf1\u2206</i> background had almost no additional stabilizing effect on XUTs and SUTs, in contrast to mRNAs. This epistatic relationship observed between <i>xrn1\u2206</i> and <i>upf1\u2206</i> for the stabilization of XUTs and SUTs is consistent with these transcripts being primarily targeted by NMD, and with Xrn1 acting as a downstream effector of this pathway."

Indeed, all XUTs and SUTs carry spurious ORFs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and some of them have been identified in ribosomal profiling experiments and shown to encode short peptides (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Smith et al., 2014</a>). However, the high sensitivity to NMD of XUTs and SUTs compared with mRNAs suggests the presence of specific features. Assuming that the first encountered ORF is translated, XUTs and SUTs carry, on average, much shorter ORFs and longer 3\u2032-UTRs than mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The presence of both a long 3\u2032-UTR and a short ORF increases NMD efficiency in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib9\">Decourty et al., 2014</a>) and thus explain why these transcripts are efficiently targeted for degradation by this pathway. Furthermore, the few XUTs and SUTs found not to be sensitive to NMD have on average significantly shorter 3\u2032-UTRs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), which is in agreement with the recently published observation that, in ribosomal profiling experiments, the length of RNA downstream of the ribosome protected region is significantly longer for NMD-sensitive compared with NMD-insensitive unannotated RNA transcripts (<a href=\"#bib41\">Smith et al., 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "Even though transcripts initiated inside ORFs are expected to be targeted for degradation by NMD due to the presence of short spurious ORFs, the high number of internally initiated transcripts (\u2018A and B-TSSCs\u2019) identified in cells lacking <i>UPF1</i> was surprising. The synthesis of such transcripts is normally repressed within transcribed regions unless the proper chromatin structure cannot be re-established in the wake of RNAPII (<a href=\"#bib42\">Smolle and Workman, 2013</a>). In particular, histone methylation by Set2 was shown to be a key determinant of this repression. We therefore analysed the impact of <i>SET2</i> deletion on \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 TSSCs identified in the <i>upf1\u2206</i> strain. While deletion of <i>SET2</i> had little effect on the internal TSSCs identified in the single <i>upf1\u2206</i> mutant, it revealed new Set2-sensitive \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 TSSCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). As expected and in contrast to A-TSSCs and B-TSSCs, deletion of <i>SET2</i> had no global effect on ORF TSSCs and only a marginal effect on CUTs, XUTs and SUTs or \u2018intergenic\u2019 TSSCs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In agreement with the observed enrichment in Set2-catalyzed H3K36 methylation towards the 3\u2032 end of ORFs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pokholok et al., 2005</a>), the \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 TSSCs more sensitive to Set2 were located further away from the mRNA 5\u2032-ends (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). Analysis of the sequence surrounding individual TSSs from these TSSCs identified a pattern almost identical to the one found for ORF-TSSs (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), confirming that they corresponded to <i>bona fide</i> transcription initiation events. However, unlike the TSSs associated with other features identified in this study, the \u2018B\u2019 TSSs were not associated with a strong NFR (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Instead, analysing the nucleosome density around these TSSs revealed the presence of a weak NFR surrounded by two well-positioned nucleosomes. This particular pattern might explain the high sensitivity of \u2018B\u2019 TSSs to mutations affecting chromatin structure, such as the deletion of the Set2 histone methyl-transferase (<a href=\"#bib42\">Smolle and Workman, 2013</a>)."

Yet, due to the mRNA 5\u2032-end heterogeneity, analysing individual TSSs gave a different picture. Indeed, transcript isoforms in which TSSs where followed by uORFs were, globally, stabilized in the absence of <i>UPF1</i>, while those in which the annotated start codon was the first ATG downstream the TSS were mostly unaffected (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, solid lines; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). A large fraction of these NMD-sensitive transcripts corresponded to minor isoforms, explaining why NMD had only a weak effect on the overall mRNA-TSSC levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Yet, for 1129 out of the 5231 active genes (22%), a fraction of their transcript isoforms carried at least one uORF and was significantly sensitive to NMD. Isoforms carrying more than one uORF appeared even more sensitive to NMD (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), suggesting that the first AUGs of uORFs containing transcripts are not always efficiently used for translation initiation, likely because they are not in a favorable context (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</a>)."

We found that 52% of the SUTs and XUTs were significantly stabilized in <i>upf1\u2206</i> cells when using the TSSCs from the TSS-sequencing experiments (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). When using the RNAseq approach, this proportion was even higher (70%; see <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), possibly because of the overall higher sequence read counts for a given transcript, which provides more power to statistical analyses. Since NMD is a translation-coupled RNA degradation pathway, the stabilizing effect seen upon <i>UPF1</i> deletion on pervasive transcripts indicated that once these transcripts reached the cytoplasm they associate with the translation machinery. Indeed, once they reached the cytoplasm the pervasive transcripts (being capped and poly-adenylated) cannot be distinguished from normal mRNAs and associate with the translation machinery. However, since they usually have short ORFs followed by relatively long 3\u2032 UTR regions (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), a hallmark of NMD substrates in yeast (<a href=\"#bib9\">Decourty et al., 2014</a>), they will be targeted for degradation by this RNA quality-control pathway. This is supported by the identification of pervasive transcripts (mainly XUTs and SUTs) in ribosomal profiling experiments performed in wild-type cells and the recent discovery of a new class of unannotated transcripts (uRNAs) associated with polyribosomes and encoding short peptides (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Smith et al., 2014</a>)."

Thus, we propose to redefine the various classes of pervasive transcripts identified in yeast into transcripts primarily degraded in the cytoplasm (SUTs and XUTs) and transcripts more sensitive to the nuclear exosome (CUTs) even though each of these degradation pathways similarly affect some transcripts and can show a synergic effect (see below)."

The strong impact of NMD inactivation on these transcripts indicated that they are exported to the cytoplasm and associate with the translation machinery, as is the case for the pervasive transcripts (see above). Even though we cannot rule out an indirect effect of the <i>UPF1</i> deletion on chromatin structure, the high number of intragenic transcripts (whether sense or antisense) identified in the <i>upf1</i>\u2206 single mutant suggests that the inhibition of transcription initiation by transcription-coupled chromatin modifications is not fully efficient and thus that some of these transcripts are produced as part of the normal transcription cycle in wild-type cells, with NMD playing an important role to eliminate them."

                                "text": "Two mechanisms of transcription termination have been reported in yeast. One depends on the cleavage and poly-adenylation complex (CPF-CFI/II), which generates the poly-adenylated mRNAs that get exported and translated in the cytoplasm, and another, which involves the NNS complex and is shared by CUTs and sn(o)RNAs precursors (see \u2018Introduction\u2019). However, the demarcation between the two modes of termination is far from being strict as some terminators can often be recognized by both pathways depending on their distance from the TSS (<a href=\"#bib37\">Porrua et al., 2012</a>). In the early phase of transcription elongation the RNAPII CTD repeats are mainly phosphorylated at Ser5, which favor recruitment of the NNS complex; while transcription proceeds, Ser2 gets phosphorylated at the expense of Ser5, promoting the recruitment of the CPF-CFI/II complex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kim et al., 2004</a>). For some pervasive transcripts, these two termination pathways may compete and generate transcripts terminated by the NNS pathways and degraded by the nuclear exosome, as well as transcripts terminated by the CPF-CFI/II pathway and exported to the cytoplasm where they are targeted for degradation by the NMD. The produced RNAs would thus accumulate to detectable levels only when both RNA quality-control pathways are inactivated. Since the nuclear exosome has recently been shown to act with the NNS complex to promote early transcription termination at specific targets in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fox et al., 2015</a>), we cannot rule out that in wild-type or <i>upf1</i>\u2206 cells transcription will normally be terminated by the NNS complex and the synthesized transcripts degraded by the nuclear exosome, while in <i>rrp6</i>\u2206 cells transcription will proceed until the polymerase encounters the next CPF-CFI/II termination signal giving rise to longer transcripts exported to the cytoplasm and targeted for degradation by the NMD."

However, the use of NMD-deficient cells allowed us to identify 22% of the active genes for which a fraction of their transcript isoforms carried at least one uORF and were significantly sensitive to NMD. Moreover, 35% of the expressed genes generated transcript isoforms initiating at iTSSs and significantly stabilized in the absence of Upf1 (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Some transcripts initiated at iTSSs were previously described in wild-type cells and shown to allow the synthesis of N-terminal variants of proteins exhibiting differential stabilities or localizations (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wu and Tzagoloff, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gammie et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Pelechano et al., 2013</a>) but their number was vastly underestimated, probably because of their sensitivity to NMD (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). These two observations reveal an important role for NMD in getting rid of numerous undesired transcripts, the majority of which likely resulted from the low specificity of TSS selection by RNAPII. Yet, we cannot rule out that some of these transcripts have a biological function. For example, the use of alternative TSSs giving rise to transcripts with very different sensitivity to NMD could be used for regulatory purposes, in a way similar to that described for some genes of the nucleotide biosynthetic pathway (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kuehner and Brow, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Thiebaut et al., 2008</a>)."

Therefore, although not quantitatively impacting the overall mRNA levels substantially (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A, 7C</a>), NMD affects qualitatively a large fraction of the mRNA transcription units. NMD also has a strong impact on the accumulation of pervasive and cryptic transcripts and thus appears as a major player shaping the yeast transcriptome. In addition, we observed that transcripts initiated at iTSSs are significantly depleted in ATGs in the +1 frame, precluding the synthesis of N-terminally truncated proteins and ensuring their efficient NMD degradation. It thus suggests that this phenomenon might be important enough to have imposed an evolutionary constraint on the methionine content of the N-terminus of the yeast proteins."

Instead of the CIP/TAP treatment before ligation with the biotinylated oligonucleotide 3118, RNA was fragmented with ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and subsequently phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Thermo scientific). The subsequent steps of library preparation were identical to the ones described above for the 5\u2032-end. Moreover, since the absence of Xrn1 affects the overall mRNA content (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sun et al., 2013</a>), an aliquot of a <i>S. pombe</i> culture was added to the cell pellet before RNA extraction for library preparation to provide an independent internal control for normalization."

The reads from the minus-TAP experiment were used to measure the background of reads originating from 5\u2019-mono phosphate RNAs remaining after phosphatase treatment, which was estimated as being, overall, lower than 2.5% (see end of the Results section \u201cTSS sequencing technique\u201d). The genome-wide data for this experiment, deposited in the GEO database, were used to filter out a few possible false positive TSSCs, as explained in the Materials and methods section \u201cFiltering TSSCs\u201d. Note that, concerning iTSSs, we purposely showed a zoom of the corresponding regions in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, which clearly demonstrates that the vast majority or reads mapped just after the START codons do originate from capped-RNAs since they are observed only after the TAP treatment.

The analysis of such functions for the thousands pervasive transcripts identified in this work is out of the scope of this manuscript. Also, and as discussed in the manuscript, a substantial fraction of mRNAs is down regulated by NMD and it certainly does not correspond to transcriptional noise. The different use of TSSs has also previously been shown to be a mean of regulation. We have now added a short paragraph in the Discussion to mention this possibility (see \u201cThese two observations reveal an important role for NMD [\u2026] some genes of the nucleotide biosynthetic pathway (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kuehner and Brow, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Thiebaut et al., 2008</a>)\u201d)."
