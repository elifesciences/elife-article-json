Using a conditional mouse model of the ACh-synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (<i>Chat</i>), we report that local elimination of acetylcholine (ACh) in medial habenula (MHb) neurons alters glutamate corelease and presynaptic facilitation. Electron microscopy and immuno-isolation analyses revealed colocalization of ACh and glutamate vesicular transporters in synaptic vesicles (SVs) in the central IPN. Glutamate reuptake in SVs prepared from the IPN was increased by ACh, indicating vesicular synergy. Mice lacking CHAT in habenular neurons were insensitive to nicotine-conditioned reward and withdrawal. These data demonstrate that ACh controls the quantal size and release frequency of glutamate at habenular synapses, and suggest that the synergistic functions of ACh and glutamate may be generally important for modulation of cholinergic circuit function and behavior."

Using a conditional mouse model of the ACh-synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (<i>Chat</i>), we report that local elimination of acetylcholine (ACh) in medial habenula (MHb) neurons alters glutamate corelease and presynaptic facilitation. Electron microscopy and immuno-isolation analyses revealed colocalization of ACh and glutamate vesicular transporters in synaptic vesicles (SVs) in the central IPN. Glutamate reuptake in SVs prepared from the IPN was increased by ACh, indicating vesicular synergy. Mice lacking CHAT in habenular neurons were insensitive to nicotine-conditioned reward and withdrawal. These data demonstrate that ACh controls the quantal size and release frequency of glutamate at habenular synapses, and suggest that the synergistic functions of ACh and glutamate may be generally important for modulation of cholinergic circuit function and behavior."

These receptors are also activated by nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that transmit a signal from one nerve to another. These chemicals are packaged into small structures called vesicles, which are found at nerve endings. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of a nerve, it triggers the release of a vesicle\u2019s contents into the gap (or 'synapse') between nerve cells. The released neurotransmitters can then bind to receptors on the neighboring nerve cells before being cleared away."

Frahm, Antolin-Fontes, G\u00f6rlich et al. have now investigated what happens when the gene encoding the enzyme that makes acetylcholine is removed from habenular nerves in mice. The experiments revealed that these mutant mice become insensitive to the rewarding properties of nicotine and are protected from the effects of its withdrawal, following long-term exposure. The loss of acetylcholine from habenular nerves was also found to reduce the generation of small electrical currents in the nerves of the IPN. These currents are generated by another neurotransmitter called glutamate. If brain slices from normal mice are infused with acetylcholine or nicotine, these currents become more frequent. This response is not seen in brains of the mutant mice suggesting that acetylcholine helps the release of glutamate from habenular nerve endings."

In the central nervous system (CNS), however, evidence supports the hypothesis that ACh acts by volume transmission and that slowly changing levels of extracellular ACh mediate arousal states contributing to attention, sleep, learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dani and Bertrand, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Everitt and Robbins, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Mesulam et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Picciotto et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Ren et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Sarter et al., 2009</a>). Extracellular ACh levels are limited by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which cleaves ACh into choline and acetyl-coA (<a href=\"#bib79\">Rosenberry, 1975</a>). Cholinergic projection neurons in the medial habenula (MHb) synapse in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), which contains extremely high levels of AChE (<a href=\"#bib22\">Flumerfelt and Contestabile, 1982</a>). At synapses with a high concentration of AChE, ACh is so quickly degraded that a single molecule cannot activate a second receptor (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kuffler and Yoshikami, 1975</a>). Since both nicotinic (nAChRs) and muscarinic (mAChRs) acetylcholine receptors are often localized extrasynaptically on dendrites and somata, and presynaptically at axonal terminals (<a href=\"#bib16\">De-Miguel and Fuxe, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Descarries et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Role and Berg, 1996</a>), it is thought that ACh volume transmission in the IPN requires high frequency stimulation of habenular neurons (<a href=\"#bib75\">Ren et al., 2011</a>). The release of ACh from habenular terminals is consistent with genetic studies demonstrating altered responses to nicotine addiction as a consequence of mutations in nicotinic receptors that are enriched in the MHb-IPN (<a href=\"#bib3\">Antolin-Fontes et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fowler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Salas et al., 2009</a>)."

For example, it has been demonstrated in several systems that neurotransmitters can be coreleased (<a href=\"#bib20\">El Mestikawy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Gras et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Guzman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Hnasko et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Hnasko and Edwards, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Ren et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Shabel et al., 2014</a>), and that cooperation between vesicular neurotransmitter transporters located in the same synaptic vesicle\u00a0(SV) can reciprocally increase the packaging of their respective neurotransmitters into SVs, a process termed vesicular synergy (<a href=\"#bib20\">El Mestikawy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Gras et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Hnasko et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, infusion of glutamate receptor antagonists into the IPN results in decreased nicotine intake (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fowler et al., 2011</a>) and withdrawal (<a href=\"#bib97\">Zhao-Shea et al., 2013</a>) suggesting that glutamate-mediated fast synaptic transmission is also important in nicotine addiction. Given evidence that both glutamate and ACh play important roles at habenular-IPN synapses, and that vesicular synergy contributes to the physiology and function of other critical CNS circuits, we were interested in examining the interactions between these transmitter systems in habenular neurons and in determining their contributions to nicotine dependence."

Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that ACh and glutamate vesicular transporters colocalize in a significant fraction of SVs in the central IPN (IPC). Patch clamp recordings showed that glutamatergic miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were smaller in IPC neurons of ChAT-cKO, but unchanged in neurons of the lateral IPN (IPL) which receives non-cholinergic input, indicating that glutamate release is reduced in the absence of ACh. Upon ACh or nicotine superfusion, wild-type\u00a0(wt) IPC neurons displayed an increased frequency of mEPSC. In ChAT-cKO slices this response was not observed, indicating that presynaptic facilitation of glutamate release is impaired. Direct measurements of glutamate reuptake into IPN SVs in the presence and absence of ACh demonstrated vesicular synergy. Behaviorally, ChAT-cKO mice were insensitive to the rewarding properties of nicotine and displayed no withdrawal signs after cessation of chronic nicotine treatment. Our results, therefore, establish an essential role for ACh corelease with glutamate in habenular neuron function and reveal an additional mechanism that may play an important role in nicotine dependence."

Thus, to remove the enzyme from habenular neurons, we employed <i>Kiaa1107-Cre</i> mice to drive conditional deletion of the CHAT enzyme in habenular neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Western blot analyses of habenular and IPN brain extracts revealed absence of CHAT in double positive mice for <i>Kiaa1107-Cre</i> and <i>Chat<sup>flox/flox</sup></i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), hereafter referred to as ChAT-cKO mice. Immunohistochemical analyses of brain sections clearly showed that CHAT immunoreactivity was absent in the MHb, fasciculus retroflexus (fr) and IPN in ChAT-cKO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a>). To assess the penetrance of the driver Cre-line we quantified the number of neurons that remained positive for CHAT in ChAT-cKO mice across different cholinergic areas (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E, F</a>). This analysis showed that only 0.3% habenular neurons in ChAT-cKO mice retained their immunoreactivity to CHAT, while the number of CHAT positive neurons in striatum, PPTg and LDTg were comparable in wt and ChAT-cKO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>).

These data show that the <i>Kiaa1107-Cre</i> strain drives Cre-recombination of the <i>Chat</i> conditional allele in 99.7% of habenular cholinergic neurons, and that it can be used to specifically delete <i>Chat</i> only from habenular neurons without perturbing other cholinergic sources in the brain. To determine whether <i>Chat</i> excision occurred during the early stages of habenular development (<a href=\"#bib72\">Quina et al., 2009</a>), we analyzed the expression of CHAT in wt and ChAT-cKO at early postnatal ages and detected the onset of <i>Chat</i> Cre-mediated excision by <i>Kiaa1107-Cre</i> between postnatal days P6 and P7 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Taken together, these data show that this genetic manipulation efficiently and selectively eliminates <i>Chat</i> in cholinergic habenular neurons, and that it does so after formation of the MHb/IPN circuitry. The ChAT-cKO mouse, therefore, is a useful model in which to test the consequences of selectively removing one neurotransmitter in a specific axonal tract."

These include projections from the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDTg), raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus, periaqueductal grey (PAG) and nucleus of the diagonal band. Studies on the neurotransmitter content of these other inputs indicate that there are only three sources that send cholinergic and glutamatergic projections to the IPN: the MHb, the LDTg and the nucleus of the\u00a0diagonal band. Importantly, in both the LDTg and the nucleus of the\u00a0diagonal band, none of the glutamatergic cells overlap with cholinergic markers (<a href=\"#bib42\">Henderson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Wang and Morales, 2009</a>).

However, within the MHb there are two distinct populations: a cholinergic population in the ventral MHb that projects to the rostral (IPR), intermediate (IPI) and central (IPC) subnuclei \ufeffof the IPN and a peptidergic (Substance P positive) population in the dorsal MHb that projects to the lateral part of the IPN (IPL)(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Both types of projections release glutamate. To quantify the degree of overlap of glutamatergic and cholinergic synapses in different nuclei of the IPN, we performed double immunostainings in wt and ChAT-cKO mice and calculated the Manders\u2019 colocalization coefficient which ranges from 0 for no colocalization to 1 for complete colocalization (<a href=\"#bib58\">Manders et al., 1993</a>). These analyses indicated an extremely high colocalization of VGLUT1 and VACHT in the IPC of both wt (M1=0.80) and ChAT-CKO (M1=0.79), less overlap in the IPI (wt, M1=0.78, ChAT-CKO, M1=0.77) and IPR (wt, M1=0.68, ChAT-CKO, M1=0.69), and no colocalization in the IPL (wt, M1=0.005, ChAT-CKO, M1=0.01) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Taken together with the published literature, our data demonstrate that the vast majority of cholinergic+glutamatergic input to the IPC originates in the ventral MHb."

We observed colabeling of VACHT-6 nm and VGLUT1-12 nm gold particles in 72 of 90 labeled synaptic terminals, 8 terminals with only VAChT-6\u00a0nm particles and 10 terminals with only VGLUT1-12 nm particles indicating that both transporters are present in the vast majority (80%) of habenular terminals in the central IPN (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). To assess whether VACHT and VGLUT1 are present in the same SV, we measured the distance from each VGLUT1-gold particle to the nearest VACHT-gold particle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) and adopted the criterion described by (<a href=\"#bib85\">Stensrud et al., 2013</a>) stating that 90 nm is the maximal distance between gold particles which colocalize in the same vesicle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). This distance has been calculated based on the diameter of a synaptic vesicle of approximately 30 nm (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gundersen et al., 1998</a>), which we consistently found to be 35.18 \u00b1 0.43 nm (n=203) in habenular terminals, and based on the distance from an antigen epitope to the center of a secondary antibody conjugated with 10 nm gold particles which spans up to 30 nm (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bergersen et al., 2012</a>). Hence, two gold particles located within a distance of 90 nm could potentially label the same vesicle (<a href=\"#bib85\">Stensrud et al., 2013</a>). Considering this maximal theoretical distance of 90\u00a0nm, 54.35% of VGLUT1-gold particles (n=75/138) could be located in the same SV as VACHT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). However given that SVs are closely packed, this may be an overestimate because adjacent particles could also be labeling transporters in neighboring SVs. As control analyses, we quantified the distance from each VGLUT1-gold particle to the closest VGLUT1-particle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), and the distance from each VACHT to the closest VACHT-gold particle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). We found that 35.95% of VGLUT1 particles (n=32/89), and 61.08% of VACHT particles (n=113/185) are within 90 nm of each other and could potentially label the same synaptic vesicle. These ultrastructural analyses indicate that ACh and glutamate vesicular transporters are coexpressed in 80% of the axonal terminals in the IPC, and that within each presynaptic terminal a significant fraction of SVs colabel with VACHT and VGLUT immunogold particles, supporting the conclusion that ACh and glutamate can be cotransported into the same synaptic vesicles in habenular cholinergic presynaptic terminals"

To isolate miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials (mEPSCs), we performed the recordings in the presence of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blockers and tetrodotoxin (TTX) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7 F\u2013K</a>). TTX blocks action potential formation and its propagation. Thus, mEPSCs events reflect the probabilistic release of single vesicles into the synapse and their measurement can be used for the quantification of release probability and vesicular glutamate content (<a href=\"#bib70\">Pinheiro and Mulle, 2008</a>). mEPSC were blocked by glutamate receptor inhibitors NBQX and D-AP5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>) indicating that mEPSCs in IPC neurons are glutamatergic, not cholinergic. Because IPN neurons exhibit high frequency mEPSCs, we only analyzed fast mEPSCs that exhibited an average amplitude &gt;5 pA. This analysis revealed that the average amplitude of mEPSC in IPC neurons of wt mice is 18.2 \u00b1 1.6 pA; whereas the average amplitude in ChAT-cKO neurons is 12.4 \u00b1 0.9 pA (p=0.005; wt: n=25; ChAT-cKO: n=24) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>). This corresponds to a 32% reduction in the amplitudes of glutamatergic mEPSC in ChAT-cKO animals, which might reflect a decrease of the vesicular content of glutamate or differences in the number or function of postsynaptic glutamate receptors (<a href=\"#bib56\">Liu et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Watt et al., 2000</a>). Quantitative analyses of the frequency of mEPSC showed no differences between IPC neurons of wt (5.3 \u00b1 1.2\u2009Hz for wt) and ChAT-cKO mice (3.9 \u00b1 0.8\u2009Hz)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K</a>). The fact that glutamatergic mEPSCs have significantly reduced amplitudes (but similar frequencies) in central IPN neurons of ChAT-cKO mice, and that nicotine-evoked cholinergic eEPSCs remain unchanged in these mice, suggest that elimination of habenular ACh decreases the vesicular content of glutamate but does not impact on the excitability of postsynaptic nAChRs."

To test whether local release of ACh could influence presynaptic facilitation by activation of nAChRs, we recorded mEPSC upon bath application of nicotine or ACh. Superfusion with nicotine (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) or ACh (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) did not change the amplitudes of mEPSCs in either wt, or increased the amplitudes of ChAT-cKO to wt levels, consistent with the hypothesis that the decrease of glutamate vesicular content in presynaptic terminals depends on the presence of intracellular ACh. Importanlty, we observed a significant increase in mEPSC frequency in wt, but not in ChAT-cKO mice upon superfusion with nicotine (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>) and ACh (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). This indicates that in the absence of network activity eliminated by TTX, nicotine or ACh activation of nAChRs at presynaptic terminals elicits enhanced discharge of glutamatergic mEPSCs in IPC neurons of wt mice. In contrast there is no presynaptic facilitation in ChAT-cKO neurons, suggesting that\u00a0presynaptic nAChRs are downregulated in the absence of ACh released by habenular terminals. We next analyzed holding currents as a measure of the excitability of postsynaptic IPN neurons. The values are very similar between genotypes and upon perfusion with nAChR agonists (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>), indicating that postsynaptic nAChRs in IPN neurons are not affected by elimination of endogenous ACh. Western blot analyses of nAChRs and GluR1 in IPN extracts did not show significant differences between wt and ChAT-cKO (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G\u2013H</a>). However this assay cannot distinguish between presynaptic, extrasynaptic and postsynaptic receptors, and whether these are at the membrane or not. Given the nAChR-mediated presynaptic effect we have measured, it is possible that ACh might be required for the trafficking of nAChRs to the membrane without affecting the total number of nAChRs in the IPN. Taken together, these data and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> show that the function of presynaptic but not postsynaptic nAChR receptors is reduced in the IPC of ChAT-cKO, and that ACh is necessary for presynaptic nAChR-mediated facilitation and for increasing the vesicular glutamate content."

(<b>D</b>) Simplified illustration of vesicular synergy: synaptic vesicles are acidified and positively charged by a V-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (brown circle) that pumps protons into the SV generating a chemical gradient (\u0394pH, inward green arrow) and an electrical gradient (\u0394\u03a8, inward red arrow). The activities of vesicular transporters depend to differing extents on \u0394pH and \u0394\u03a8 due to the charge on the neurotransmitter and the stoichiometry of coupling to H<sup>+</sup>. VACHT preferentially uses the \u0394pH chemical gradient while VGLUT relies more on \u0394\u03a8 component. During each transport cycle, VACHT exchanges two protons (H<sup>+</sup>) for one ACh molecule (ACh<sup>+</sup> positively charged) thereby dissipating \u0394pH (outward green arrow) twice faster than \u0394\u03a8, a situation promoting VGLUT activity. VGLUT activity exchanges one glutamate molecule (Glu<sup>-</sup> negatively charged) by nH<sup>+</sup> and causes the opposite imbalance dissipating more \u0394\u03a8 than \u0394pH (outward orange arrow). The transport activity of VGLUT thereby compensates for the bioenergetic imbalance produced by VACHT activity and vice versa. This reciprocal vesicular synergy between transporters allows a maximal accumulation of ACh and glutamate under a constant \u0394\u03a8 and \u0394pH gradient (see review by <a href=\"#bib45\">Hnasko et al., 2012</a>). In the absence of ACh<sup>+</sup> as it occurs in synaptic terminals of ChAT-cKO mice, there is no exchange of ACh<sup>+</sup>/2H<sup>+</sup> and synaptic vesicles progressively become less positively charged and the plateau level of Glu<sup>-</sup> uptake is reduced.

Given that VACHT and VGLUTs are coexpressed in cholinergic SVs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a> and <a href=\"#fig10\">10A\u2013C</a>) and that the absence of ACh decreases mEPSC amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), we hypothesized that the addition of ACh would increase the uptake of glutamate into SVs. Vesicular transporters use the energy generated by the v-ATPase that pumps protons into the SV to generate an acidic (\u0394pH) and positively charged (\u0394\u03c8) electrochemical gradient (\u0394\u00b5H<sup>+</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). During each transport cycle, two protons will be replaced by one ACh thereby decreasing \u0394pH without affecting the positive outwardly directed \u0394\u03c8, a situation promoting VGLUT activity (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Hnasko and Edwards, 2012</a>). The addition of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> increases vesicular glutamate uptake by increasing the intravesicular pH therefore lowering \u0394pH without affecting \u0394\u03c8 (<a href=\"#bib71\">Preobraschenski et al., 2014</a>), indicating that ACh might work in the same direction. While recent evidence indicates that vesicular synergy is operated by glutamate acting as a buffering anion (<a href=\"#bib37\">Gras et al., 2008</a>), the reciprocal synergy has not been reported. To test this possibility, we purified SVs from IPN samples of rats and performed uptake assays. Uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H]-glutamate was measured in the presence of neostigmine, a specific inhibitor of the AChE. Values were corrected for nonspecific uptake in the presence of FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone;\u00a0inhibitor of vesicular transporters). Under these conditions, the accumulation of [<sup>3</sup>H]-glutamate in IPN vesicles increased and reached a plateau of 38 \u00b1 3 pmol/ mg of protein at 10\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>). In the presence of ACh, [<sup>3</sup>H]-glutamate accumulation increased to 51 \u00b1 15 pmol of glutamate/mg of protein (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>). Thus, addition of ACh increased vesicular glutamate uptake by 35.8 \u00b1 13.6% relative to control vesicles. Addition of the positively charged NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+\u00a0</sup>also\u00a0led to an increase of glutamate uptake (140.7 \u00b1 13 pmol). The increase by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> was much more pronounced than with ACh possibly because NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> addresses all glutamatergic SVs present in the IPN preparation, while ACh can only increase glutamate uptake in those SVs equipped with VACHT and VGLUT. Altogether, our results show that ACh synergizes vesicular filling of glutamate, providing additional functional evidence for the coexistence of VACHT and glutamate vesicular transporters in a subset of IPN vesicles."

The studies presented here reveal that ACh production at MHb-IPN synapses is essential for the establishment of nicotine dependence, and that local ACh action plays an important role in withdrawal responses. We demonstrate that loss of ACh selectively in habenular neurons results in a reduction in the content of glutamate in synaptic vesicles isolated from the IPN, supporting the recent finding that MHb neurons corelease ACh and glutamate (<a href=\"#bib75\">Ren et al., 2011</a>). We provide functional evidence for a dual role of ACh in the IPN: first, the facilitation of vesicular glutamate uptake into SVs; and second, the modulation of transmitter release through activation of presynaptic nAChRs. Both mechanisms influence the excitability of IPN neurons (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>), thus accounting for the lack of nicotine dependence in ChAT-cKO mice."

There is physiological evidence for glutamate corelease with dopamine, GABA, adrenaline, noradrenaline, serotonin, and ACh in specific neuronal populations in the CNS (<a href=\"#bib20\">El Mestikawy et al., 2011</a>). This allows a very local control of excitatory and inhibitory balance at individual synapses (<a href=\"#bib84\">Shabel et al., 2014</a>). While some studies have documented the presence of distinct transporters in the same SV and determined their functions (<a href=\"#bib37\">Gras et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Hnasko et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Zander et al., 2010</a>), it is also possible that not all corelease can be recognized by analysis of neurotransmitter enzyme synthesis and packaging transporters (<a href=\"#bib90\">Tritsch et al., 2014</a>). It has been shown that the different ionic properties of vesicular transporters can foster physiologically complementing functions depending on the electrical (\u0394\u03a8, for VGLUT) or pH gradients (\u0394pH, for VAChT, VMAT2, VGAT). We show here for the first time that in the absence of ACh, VACHT can no longer promote glutamate co-entry through VGLUT1/2, thus demonstrating synergy between VACHT and VGLUT1/2 in these synapses. Given previous studies of striatal synapses that demonstrated that loss of VGLUT3 results in a decrease of ACh uptake by synaptic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib37\">Gras et al., 2008</a>), and our demonstration that loss of ACh affects glutamate uptake by VGLUT1/2, it seems most probable that transport of glutamate and ACh into IPN vesicles occurs by a reciprocal mechanism. Besides MHb neurons and striatal interneurons, other cholinergic neurons also appear to contain a vesicular glutamate transporter or corelease glutamate, including BF neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Gritti et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Henny and Jones, 2008</a>), and spinal motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib66\">Nishimaru et al., 2005</a>). This is also the case in the marine ray, <i>Torpedo californica</i> (<a href=\"#bib55\">Li and Harlow, 2014</a>). Cotransmission of ACh and glutamate might therefore be considered the rule rather than the exception raising a fundamental question about the role of cotransmitter release and neurotransmitter synergy at cholinergic synapses and suggesting that vesicular synergy of these transmitters must have added an adaptive advantage."

In particular, it has been shown that brief stimulation of MHb efferents elicits glutamatergic but not cholinergic responses, and that tetanic stimulation is required to generate slow inward currents mediated by nAChRs (<a href=\"#bib75\">Ren et al., 2011</a>). These differences in transmission could be attributed to the existence of a cholinergic synaptic vesicle population distant from the active zone that is released only during high frequency signaling. However, we can exclude this possibility given our demonstration that glutamate and ACh vesicular transporters colocalize in cholinergic SVs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and that both cholinergic and glutamatergic SV are found in close proximity and far (&gt;350 nm) from the active zone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Therefore the two modes of transmission most likely reflect the different distribution of postsynaptic glutamate and ACh receptors. Indeed, a great deal of evidence suggests that ACh diffuses to pre- and extrasynaptic sites where it modulates the release of other transmitters (<a href=\"#bib12\">Covernton and Lester, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Descarries et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Descarries and Mechawar, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Girod et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Mansvelder et al., 2009</a>). The anatomical structure of the IPN, with numerous varicosities along habenular axonal projections that converge throughout the nucleus in a topographically organized manner forming \u2018en passant\u2019 and crest synapses (<a href=\"#bib67\">Parajuli et al., 2012</a>), supports this hypothesis. Electron microscopy studies have revealed that these boutons are highly immunoreactive for CHAT (<a href=\"#bib54\">Lenn et al., 1985</a>), consistent with our studies indicating that the vesicles visualized in these synapses are cholinergic. Given the high concentration and catalytic power of AChE in the IPN (<a href=\"#bib22\">Flumerfelt and Contestabile, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Franklin and Paxinos, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Quinn, 1987</a>), the pre-terminal localization of synaptic boutons in \u2018en passant\u2019 synapses along habenular axons (<a href=\"#bib67\">Parajuli et al., 2012</a>), and our results showing colocalization of ACh and glutamate transporters in the same SV populations, it seems plausible that high frequency stimulation of MHb terminals is necessary to release sufficient ACh to reach nAChRs in the IPN (volume transmission) while brief stimulation can elicit fast postsynaptic glutamatergic responses (wired transmission)."

Receptors containing the \u03b24 and/or \u03b15 subunit contribute to the activation of this tract during nicotine intake and are critical for the aversive (reward-inhibiting) effects of high-dose nicotine (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fowler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Frahm et al., 2011</a>), while \u03b12, \u03b15 and \u03b24-subunits play a major role in nicotine withdrawal (<a href=\"#bib81\">Salas et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Salas et al., 2009</a>). Less is known about the contribution of the MHb-IPN pathway to the reinforcing effects of nicotine. Intracerebroventricular injection of the \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR blocker conotoxin AuIB, resulted in attenuated reward and withdrawal from nicotine (<a href=\"#bib47\">Jackson et al., 2013</a>). However, although \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR subunits coassemble with \u03b15 nAChRs in about 15\u201335% of MHb-IPN neurons (<a href=\"#bib36\">Grady et al., 2009</a>), the reward-enhancing properties of nicotine are not altered in \u03b15-KO mice (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fowler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fowler et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Jackson et al., 2013</a>). Given the large variety of nAChR subtypes in this circuit and their differential distribution on glutamatergic and GABAergic pre- and postsynaptic terminals, the advantage of local removal of the endogenous ligand ACh to understand the impact of nicotine on this tract is apparent. Thus, using ChAT-cKO mice we were able to demonstrate for the first time that ACh in the MHb-IPN circuit is crucial for the establishment of dependence-related behaviors, including reward and tolerance to nicotine."

However, it appears that GAD-immunoreactive cells constitute the largest population of neurons in the IPN (<a href=\"#bib49\">Kawaja et al., 1989</a>) and activation of \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs located on GABAergic interneurons can trigger spike discharge and GABA-release (<a href=\"#bib12\">Covernton and Lester, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lena et al., 1993</a>), suggesting that ACh and nicotine modulate both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission in the IPN. Importantly, repeated exposure to nicotine leads to inactivation of nAChRs, thus altering the modulatory effects of the endogenous transmitter ACh. Given that nicotine increases GABA release in the IPN and that continuous nicotine exposure desensitizes \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs considerably more than \u03b17 and \u03b13\u03b24 nAChRs (for review see\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib29\">Giniatullin et al., 2005</a>]), it is possible that persistent desensitization of \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs on GABAergic neurons in the IPN increases the net excitatory output of this tract, as previously demonstrated in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Mansvelder et al., 2002</a>). The lack of dynamic changes in nAChR activity on inhibitory neurons in the absence of ACh, and subsequent altered stimulation of efferent targets, could thereby contribute to the insensitivity of ChAT-cKO mice to nicotine-mediated reward and tolerance. Descending projections from the IPN include the dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus and LDTg. Both nuclei exchange reciprocal information and provide glutamatergic (<a href=\"#bib27\">Geisler and Wise, 2008</a>) and cholinergic (<a href=\"#bib62\">Maskos et al., 2005</a>) input to the VTA. Therefore, loss of cholinergic communication in the MHb-IPN axis, indirectly influencing activation of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, fails to induce nicotine-dependent behaviors, including reward, tolerance and withdrawal in ChAT-cKO animals."

Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as risk factors for nicotine dependence and lung cancer in genes encoding nAChR subunits (<i>CHRNB3-CHRNA6</i> and <i>CHRNB4-CHRNA3-CHRNA5</i> clusters), and in nicotine-metabolizing enzymes (<i>CYP2A6</i> and <i>CYP2B6</i>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bierut et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Kumasaka et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Saccone et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Thorgeirsson et al., 2010</a>). In addition, variations in the <i>CHAT</i> gene have been associated with prospective smoking cessation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Heitjan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ray et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Turner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Wei et al., 2010</a>). The studies presented here show that nicotine does not trigger nicotine-dependent behaviors unless the endogenous neurotransmitter ACh is released from MHb neurons to further promote glutamate corelease. In the corticostriatal circuitry, it has been proposed that glutamate homeostasis underlies drug-seeking behavior (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kalivas, 2009</a>). After repetitive drug use, deregulation of this homeostasis increases the release of glutamate during drug relapse (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kalivas, 2009</a>). Similarly, in the MHb, re-exposure to nicotine after abstinence increases the pacemaking of MHb neurons (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gorlich et al., 2013</a>) and subsequent corelease of ACh and glutamate from habenular axonal terminals. Although it is known that the main action of nAChRs is presynaptic in the CNS and postsynaptic at the neuromuscular junction, no studies have addressed the role of ACh in this mechanism. The studies presented here not only agree with the conclusion that nicotine-induced behaviors act via presynaptic receptors that regulate glutamate release but also show that nicotine is not sufficient to induce dependence unless ACh is released and promotes further release of glutamate. Given that other cholinergic neurons beside MHb neurons corelease glutamate, and our findings demonstrating that ACh controls the quantal size and release frequency of glutamate, it is possible that the synergistic functions of ACh and glutamate may be generally important for modulation of cholinergic circuit function and behavior and that genetic variations in <i>CHAT</i> may influence several aspects of glutamatergic transmission in the addiction process."

We have rephrased this part in the manuscript, we include additional electrophysiological measurements of holding currents and we have increased the sample size of mEPSC recordings upon nicotine and ACh bath application (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). These results show that the frequency of mEPSCs increases in wt but not in ChAT-cKO. This indicates that there is no presynaptic facilitation in the ChAT-cKO suggesting that the presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in habenular terminals in the IPN are downregulated in the absence of ACh released by the terminals. In contrast, since the holding currents are similar between genotypes, postsynaptic nAChRs in IPN neurons are most likely not affected by elimination of ACh. Taken together, the new data in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and the previous data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> (now <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) indicate that the function of presynaptic but not postsynaptic nAChR receptors is reduced in ChAT-cKO. The WB does not reflect this functional difference, indicating that the total number of nAChRs in the IPN is unchanged. Given the presynaptic effect we have measured, it is possible that ACh might be required for the trafficking of nAChRs to the membrane."

We carefully checked the literature and there is no indication that nicotine is actively transported over the plasma membrane by the choline transporter ChT (Mansner, 1977). We also found no indication that nicotine binds to VACHT or is actively taken up.
