Our self-organizing model, based on ring-rate adaptation, points at a complex answer.

The simulation of the full model, however, shows that the approach to such asymptotic states involves several sub-processes over distinct time scales. The smoothing of the initially irregular multiple fields of individual units and their arrangement into hexagonal grids over certain best planes are observed to occur relatively quickly, even in large 3D volumes.

However, as early as the 1960s, experiments in rats had revealed that specific cells within the hippocampus\u2014called place cells\u2014fire whenever an animal is in a particular location, and thus enable the animal to build up a map of its environment."

This raises an obvious question: can grid cells also represent three-dimensional space? Stella and Treves have addressed this issue by constructing a computer model that simulates grid cell activity in a virtual bat flying through a virtual room. The model reveals that grid cells switch from firing largely at random to firing in some semblance of a three-dimensional pattern relatively quickly."

Indeed, the model suggests that a bat flying at 1 metre per second around a room that measured 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 metres would need to fly continuously for a very long time (at least 80 hours) before such a pattern could be established in three dimensions. This suggests that the regular tessellation shown by grid cells in two dimensions might not be routinely established in three dimensions. Instead, simpler \u2018precursor\u2019 firing patterns may form over shorter periods of time, providing a looser mapping of three-dimensional space."

New findings about space-related activity in the bat have recently raised this question again (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ulanovsky and Moss, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Yartsev et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Yartsev and Ulanovsky, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Finkelstein et al., 2014</a>). The similarity in the place cell and, most remarkably, in the grid cell representation between rodents and bats suggests a common neural substrate for spatial navigation, shared across these mammals (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersen and Buneo, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Jacobs et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Sereno and Lehky, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Killian et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Indovina et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Jacobs et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Thurley et al., 2014</a>), and it provides an indication possibly valid also for other animals living and moving extensively in three dimensions, like for example dolphins, monkeys and even non-mammalian species (<a href=\"#bib7\">Healy et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Dacke and Srinivasan, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wu and Dickman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Burt de Perera and Holbrook, 2012</a>). At the same time, the obvious difference in the behavior of these species requires a system that flexibly adapts to perform computations as different as mapping two- or three-dimensional space (<a href=\"#bib13\">Knierim et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Hayman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Taube and Shinder, 2013</a>).

While place cell and head direction cells have been shown to directly generalize to three dimensions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Yartsev and Ulanovsky, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Finkelstein et al., 2014</a>), the form that grid cells will exhibit in higher dimensionality (currently tested in flying bats [<a href=\"#bib5\">Ginosar et al., 2014</a>]) is still not clear. Further, the question is still open of how the mechanism producing such a complex periodic pattern on a surface can, in the case of bats, extend to a volume (<a href=\"#bib11\">Jeffery et al., 2013</a>), even when accepting the information-theoretic optimality of a regular lattice (<a href=\"#bib16\">Mathis et al., 2014</a>). In the self-organization perspective that we propose, the spatial responses first emerge spontaneously, at the single unit level, with no engineering required. In the simplest version of the model, which we have explored in a series of studies (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kropff and Treves, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Si et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Stella et al., 2013</a>), the periodicity of the grid pattern is a result of firing rate adaptation during exploration sessions that span a considerable developmental time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1, c</a>). It is fixated gradually by means of synaptic plasticity in the feed-forward connections, which convey broad spatial inputs, for example but not necessarily from \u2018place units\u2019\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1, b</a>). Contrary to other models limited to the explanation of grid cell expression, this model delves into the issue of their induction and, most importantly, can account for the effects of the geometry of the explored environment on the outcome of the self-organization process. We have shown how, for example, the model produces pentagonal grids on a spherical surface and heptagonal ones on a hyperbolic one (<a href=\"#bib24\">Urdapilleta et al., 2015</a>). The nature of our model allows us to now investigate the process of grid cell self-organization in three dimensions without the need to modify any of its features. We use bats as our reference, as it is the species currently available for experiments during roughly homogeneous navigation along the three dimensions of physical space (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1, a</a>)."

We will assume that at the time the mEC units develop their firing maps, spatially modulated or place cell-like activity is already present, either in the parahippocampal cortex or in the hippocampus. The network model works in the same way with any kind of spatially modulated input, but the place cell assumption reduces the averaging necessary for learning. Moreover, as recent studies have shown (<a href=\"#bib15\">Langston et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Wills et al., 2010</a>), it is entirely plausible that place cells develop an adult-like spatial code earlier than grid cells do.

The range of values that it can take in simulations, however, is constrained in practice by the number of place cells used in the model. Basically the dimension of each place field should guarantee a homogeneous amount of global input activity across the environment. Given a sufficient place field density in the input layer, the parameter does not play a critical role anymore. As we show in the following, the properties of the developing grid fields depend on the time scale of adaptation and not on the size of the place fields."

Both solutions are based on a series of layers of spheres arranged in a hexagonal pattern. These layers are stacked one upon the other with given phase differences between them (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The difference between FCC and HCP lies in the sequence with which these phases appear. Given one of these layers, and taking it as a reference with positioning A, there are two possible arrangements (B and C) of the next layer, obtained with a translation of A, that puts all the spheres at the same distance from their neighbors. Any sequence of A, B and C without immediate repetitions has the same, maximum, packing score, but among all sequences there are the two regular prototypes:"

Apart from this expedient, the calculations for the HCP function follow the same line of those previously described for the FCC case. A significant difference is the dependence of the HCP solution on two parameters <i>k</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> and <i>k</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>. Therefore, while the choice of the adaptation parameters <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> and <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>S</i></sub> fixes one of the two (as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, left), one can still optimize over the ratio between the two. The value of <i>k</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>/<i>k</i><sub><i>xy</i></sub> that should be observed in the presence of a perfect HCP pattern can be calculated as 3/32<sup>1/2</sup> \u2248 0.53. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> (right), we plot the values obtained for different powers of our expression for the HCP arrangement. While for higher values of <i>n</i> the value of <i>k</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>/<i>k</i><sub><i>xy</i></sub> extracted from the optimization progressively approaches the theoretical one, interestingly the <i>n</i> = 1 case exhibits a very different behavior with an optimal <i>k</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>/<i>k</i><sub><i>xy</i></sub> = 0, independently of the value of <i>\u03b3</i>. As <i>k</i><sub><i>z</i></sub> represents the reciprocal of the inter-layer spacing (and also the wavelength of the activity modulation along the z-axis), this value indicates that the minimum value of the cost function is obtained with infinite distance (and infinitely slow modulation of the activity), or equivalently with a column-like distribution of activity, with a single layer of fields extending indefinitely in the vertical direction (<a href=\"#bib11\">Jeffery et al., 2013</a>). This solution is distinct from the case of a single layer of fields, with no activity above and below them, a situation that does not entail the regular, three-dimensional configurations we are interested in. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> we plot the values of the wave vectors obtained with the set of parameters: <i>v\u03c4</i><sub><i>L</i></sub> = 1, <math id=\"inf22\"><mrow><mi>\u03bd</mi><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>S</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac><mi>\u03bd</mi><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>L</mi></msub></mrow></math>, <i>\u03c1</i> = 0.03.

Starting from an initial random arrangement of connections and a correspondingly heterogeneous distribution of activity, the combined effect of adaptation and synaptic learning leads the units to approach, after a transient reorganization of their firing fields in space, a stable configuration that is the outcome of the self-organization process. Looking at the firing configurations developed by the units in our simulations, one can notice a similarity with the theoretical solutions maximizing the packing density of spheres described above. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> we show two typical examples from the units emerging in the model mEC layer in two distinct simulations, each taken after about 15 million time steps of learning time. On the top row the firing rates of the units presents a blobby appearance, with equally sized, spherical fields homogeneously distributed in the volume. Although rate maps resemble those we expect from a regular tiling of the three-dimensional environment, they are not very informative about the overall organization of the fields nor about any symmetry in their spatial distribution. Computing the corresponding autocorrelograms we indeed find that the two units are rather different in this respect, as they express two distinct field configurations. One is in fact presenting an approximately FCC arrangement (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, left), while the other is close to an HCP one (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, right). Overlaying the axes of symmetry of the two ideal arrangements (green and orange lines) illustrates the differences between the two."

We can contrast our observations on the asymptotic states approached by the mEC units simulated numerically with the analytic evaluation of the cost function associated with the regular asymptotic states (see the \u2018Measure of long-range order\u2019 section in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The calculations are based on the functional in <a href=\"#equ14\">Equation 14</a>, comprising two terms, one representing the degree of smoothness of the map, the other the effects of adaptation. Its minimization (adjusting regular solutions to fit with the firing rate adaptation time scale) shows a rather complex interplay between different possible states (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, right). First of all, considering FCC and HCP separately, we see how, for both of them, solutions of higher power become successively favored as the value of the <i>\u03b3</i> parameter increases, that is, as the weight of the adaptation component becomes increasingly dominant in the evaluation of the cost function. Therefore, the same arrangement of field positions, but with the fields becoming more and more concentrated and peaked, is selected moving rightward on the graph. In parallel, the two configurations, FCC and HCP, compete with each other, and the two are alternating as the optimal solution in different portions of the parameter space. The picture that emerges from this analysis is one of close equivalence of FCC and HCP in terms of optimality. There is no evidence of a regime in which one of the two strongly dominates the other. Instead, the features that are common to the two, like the hexagonal arrangement and the 12 first neighbors, appear to be the relevant ones for the evaluation of the cost function, with the differences appearing when considering higher order features only marginally contributing to its value and therefore generating minuscule quantitative differences between the two."

The conclusion they suggest, however, is supported by our observations from the numerical simulation of the full model. The system does not appear to converge asymptotically to either of the two regular configurations of fields. Although neither FCC- nor HCP-symmetric solutions provide a unique description of the final arrangement of the units, the simulations produce examples of units similar to either of the two optimal packing solutions. The discrepancy between the configurations observed and the symmetric solutions, however, is not due to the emergence of mixtures of the two (like for example in a ABABCAB ordering of the layers), but rather to small deviations of the relative phases between fields of different layers from the optimal ones. Although we tested our model in environments of different size (as discussed in a following section), the model is computationally extremely demanding to run in very large environments, large enough to investigate this sort of mixed ordering. Analytical results show a substantial equivalence of FCC and HCP ordering, thus implying, in large structures, the possibility of multiple switching between the two, without altering the overall optimality of the configuration. Nevertheless, simulations show that this equivalence, even in the case of the small environments we tested (where we could usually observe three or only slightly more layers at the same time), is expressed in intermediate arrangements which are only partially symmetric. It is thus likely that introducing additional layers would just propagate this situation further without leading to the appearance of FCC and HCP mixtures."

Both FCC and HCP are described by unitary cells of 13 fields and the difference between the two lies in the different positioning of just three of them with respect to the others. It is evident by looking at <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, however, that this long-range order is constructed from a set of building blocks that express symmetries and regularities at a local level, involving fewer fields and a smaller set of constraints.

This process corresponds to the formation of a grid on the plane, but in three dimensions it involves the creation of not just one hexagon but of multiple superimposed planes each of which contains hexagonally arranged fields. To investigate the structure of the activity on the single layers, we take multiple slices of the autocorrelogram matrix. We take sections passing through the center, with different angles of azimuth and elevation. We then compute the autocorrelogram values on each of these planes, and we compare it with a hexagonal template of equidistant peaks with <i>\u03c0</i>/3 periodicity. The plane most resembling a hexagonal pattern according to a correlation measure (the \u2018best plane\u2019) is selected together with its similarity score. This method provides us with an equivalent of the traditional grid score used to judge the quality of planar grid cells. In <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> (top right) we plot the time evolution of the average over the population of this score. Starting from very low values, indicative of a still unorganized ensemble of fields, the score steadily rises to reach a value of about 0.85 (out of a maximum of 1) after 6 million time steps and then remains stable over the rest of the simulation."

We looked for the dispersion of their orientations, calculating the angles formed by the best planes of different cells (<i>\u03b2</i>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, middle left), and the angle between the hexagonal grid axis of cells sharing a similar best plane (<i>\u03c9</i>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, middle right). We indeed see that collateral interaction tends to align in time the principal layer of different cells, defining a preferred orientation for the global structure of the grid. The emergence of the common alignment of the layers is slower than the formation of the layers themselves. It takes about 12 million time steps of exploration time to significantly reduce the dispersion of the angles (note that <i>\u03b2</i> is slightly faster, maybe indicating a tendency to first define the layers and then arrange shifts within them)."

This higher level in the hierarchy of order for three-dimensional grids, which when attained would provide a completely regular tiling of the volume, does not have a correspondence in the two-dimensional case. It is thus a completely new level of complexity that can be only expressed when producing grids in three dimensions.

Different levels of complexity appear in the arrangement of fields with different speed. Fast converging quantities like the formation of equilateral triangles of fields and successively of layers of fields with hexagonal symmetry appear first, framing the activity of single units in the network. These initial structures are then modified on a slower time scale to obtain a global coordination among cells. Planes of fields are rotated to align them across the population, generating a common tiling of the fields of different cells that conserve their unique spatial phase. This global ordering is only partial though, as the phases of the units are only partially overlapping with those necessary to reproduce a perfectly regular tiling of the volume (either with an FCC or an HCP). If we exclude the very initial phase of network dynamics, self-organization does not appear to affect these aspects of network activity that therefore remain loosely determined even after a very extended period of time."

Although the developmental maturation of the bat encompasses longer cumulative flying hours, what is likely relevant for structuring the feed-forward connections is time spent flying in the environment of the actual experiment. Not only can the mechanisms leading to grid-like activity only unfold while navigating and not during rest periods, they also appear to require, in our model, the exact configuration of input activity at each location in the environment. Therefore this constraint is likely to put the time scale of grid cell formation well above the feasible time duration of the experiment."

It is protracted later by continued but minor smoothing of the fields, now in place on the best planes, concurrent, if collateral interactions are included, with the adjustment of the planes with respect to each other (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, middle), which extends over longer times. We do note that we have observed considerable variability in the degree of smoothness of the individual fields obtained at the end of the simulation, with a tendency for the larger volumes to require longer time and end up with rougher fields.

In these conditions, even the weak, sub-linear dependence of time scales with volume, that we do observe, may be sufficient to determine a switch between the possibility of forming regular structures and leaving them beyond reach."

Nevertheless, this order might express only a partial set of the full spectrum of potential three-dimensional symmetry properties. It might be still sufficient to distinguish the activity of these cells from a random multi-peaked pattern, but it would place it at a substantial distance from a perfectly regular pattern, too. In our model this distance varies across a population of cells: some of them show only small deviations from perfect symmetry. We thus cannot exclude the possibility of finding some of these extreme cases in real animals. At the same time, the vast majority of simulated grid cells are very far from a perfectly regular arrangement and while the number of units actually found in the tails of the distribution of scores might be strongly dependent on some specific factors of the development of grid cells, the bulk of grid-like but imperfect cells can be regarded as a robust aspect of our model, and might extend to very different situations of 3D grid cell development, possibly including other species experiencing three-dimensional navigation."

The two properties defining any regular triangle are the length of the side and the internal angle. Therefore, to characterize the local structure of the grid pattern in an individual unit we extract these two properties from the spikes it produces. Firstly, from our three-dimensional rate maps we generate a representative number of spike pairs through a Poisson process to construct the distribution of distances. Typically, this distribution is highly multi-peaked, where the first peak corresponds to distances between intra-field spikes, the second peak between spikes belonging to neighboring fields, and subsequent peaks between spikes in non-adjacent fields. Since the length of the side of the tiling triangle in a regular pattern would correspond to the location of the second peak, we define a range of distances around this peak as a filter condition to declare spikes belonging to neighboring fields. The limits of this range were defined by the surrounding troughs, if they exist, or fixed to 0.5 <i>d</i> and 1.4 <i>d</i>, if they do not, where <i>d</i> is the distance corresponding to the second peak, declared as the grid distance of the unit. As a control condition, we generate a distribution of pseudo-spikes from reshuffling spike\u2013cell combinations and randomly reassigning spikes to different units, thus removing the field structure of the activity of each cell. Therefore, distances between pseudo-spikes are unimodally distributed. Secondly, triplets of spikes were putatively classified as belonging to neighboring fields based on distance filtering in the previous range, and the three internal angles determined. These three angles were pooled together and accumulated in an overall angular distribution. The distribution of angles so obtained for the spiking activity and the control condition were different and their ratio was used to characterize the angle subtended in the triangular pattern. Typically (in the asymptotical state), this ratio was unimodal and distributed asymmetrically around a peak. We defined the characteristic angle as the median of the above-chance distribution (ratio values above unity indicate an above-chance condition or, in other words, angles more frequently obtained than randomly) and the significance of the angle as the maximum of the ratio distribution."

                                "text": "FCC and HCP differences in the configuration of fields generate distinct symmetry properties for the two arrangements. These symmetries are reflected in the autocorrelograms that can be extracted from them. In the same way as the autocorrelogram of a hexagonal grid is a hexagonal grid, calculating the autocorrelogram of FCC (using function 20) just reproduces the same configuration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, bottom left) of fields, with six symmetric pairs of equivalent peaks surrounding the central one. Indeed the symmetries of the structure are such that one can find four planes passing through the origin which contain peaks arranged in a hexagonal way; these planes form angles of 72\u00b0 and are all equivalent. The case is different for HCP, where the central symmetry is missing. In this case the autocorrelogram extracted from <a href=\"#equ25\">Equation 25</a> does not reproduce the original form of the function. In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, bottom right, one can see that the autocorrelogram presents nine pairs of peaks around the central one. But in this case these peaks are not all the same. The HCP structure is again periodical for translations along a plane, generating six peaks of height 1, like those of FCC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, purple peaks). As the structure is translated out of this preferred plane, the ABAB arrangement of the HCP layers is such that there are no translations that reproduce the exact same configuration of fields, in the autocorrelogram. The six peaks above the central one (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, orange peaks) are indeed half-peaks, corresponding to an overlap of only half (six out of 12) of the peaks of the basic unit. Therefore, although one can identify seven planes with hexagonally arranged peaks on this autocorrelogram, they are not all equivalent to those in FCC. Only one of them contains all the peaks of height 1 and forms an angle of 72\u00b0 with the other six, which include half-peaks and form an angle of 56\u00b0 between them. We can then use different measures to quantify the degree of similarity of a unit activity to the FCC and HCP prototypical field arrangements. One measure is based on the autocorrelogram. From this, we first identify the best plane, the one which yields the highest grid score, measured here as the value of the planar autocorrelogram at the origin, that is, the planar autocorrelation over all the slices passing through the origin. Once the best plane has been identified, we use the fact that the FCC has three more planes with hexagonal symmetry, at \u223c72\u00b0 from the best plane and between one another. HCP instead has six of them, again at \u223c72\u00b0 from the best plane, but at \u223c56\u00b0 between them. We then take the slice scores, that is, the planar autocorrelation values on any one slice. We take all the slices at an angle of \u223c72\u00b0 from the best plane and sum the scores of the best triplet of slices with \u223c72\u00b0 of separation (<i>\u03b6</i><sub>2 \u2212 4</sub>). We then exclude them and take a second triplet of slices again with a \u223c72\u00b0 distance from one another and a distance of \u223c56\u00b0 from the first triplet (<i>\u03b6</i><sub>5 \u2212 7</sub>). These two numbers tell us about the number of different planes with hexagonal symmetry that can be built from our autocorrelograms. Both scores run from \u22123 to 3, as they are the sum of three correlations. We expect <i>\u03b6</i><sub>2 \u2212 4</sub> to be high for both FCC and HCP arrangements, and its value should be considered as an indicator of the general quality of the grid. <i>\u03b6</i><sub>5 \u2212 7</sub> instead should be high only for those grids presenting an HCP type of arrangement, but again its value might be affected by the quality of the grid. We thus define a score for the degree of FCC similarity as:"

The authors pursue a two-pronged approach in which they simulate a set of weekly selective 3D place cells with feedforward plastic synapses onto a population of entering grid cells and demonstrate the formation of 3D grid fields, with the grid spacing being controlled by the time-constant of firing-rate adaptation. Additionally they employ an effective field approach to analytically predict low-energy configurations of the population firing rate maps."

They show that, as the network is learning, already at the very beginning there appear triplets of spatial blobs of activity that are angled at 60-degrees. Only much later, with extensive training, do these triplets \u201ccrystallize\u201d, and the network gradually develops optimal-packing structures such as the hexagonal close pack (HCP) lattice or face centered cubic (FCC) lattice - as well as neurons which exhibit a mixture of HCP/FCC. This study is very interesting in that it provides direct predictions on how and why 3D grid cells should develop during ontogeny; there is very little data on this and so it is quite interesting that the authors have managed to make headway on this topic through careful theoretical analysis, examining the space of possibilities ahead of experiments. The model also explains how and why a high heterogeneity of 3D grid cells is expected - from cells exhibiting only triplets of activity-blobs angled at 60-degrees (but without any large-scale lattice organization), through random mixtures of HCP and FCC lattices, and ending with perfectly crystallized HCP and FCC lattices. This study will be of great interest to many neuroscientists, system biologists and physicists."
