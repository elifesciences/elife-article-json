While the network dynamics underlying global oscillations have been well characterised, their function is debated. Here, we show that such global oscillations are a direct consequence of optimal efficient coding in spiking networks with synaptic delays and noise. To avoid firing unnecessary spikes, neurons need to share information about the network state. Ideally, membrane potentials should be strongly correlated and reflect a 'prediction error' while the spikes themselves are uncorrelated and occur rarely. We show that the most efficient representation is when: (i) spike times are entrained to a global Gamma rhythm (implying a consistent representation of the error); but (ii) few neurons fire on each cycle (implying high efficiency), while (iii) excitation and inhibition are tightly balanced. This suggests that cortical networks exhibiting such dynamics are tuned to achieve a maximally efficient population code."

In sensory areas, one typically observes 'global oscillations' in the gamma-band range (30\u201380\u00a0Hz), alongside single neuron responses that are irregular and sparse (<a href=\"#bib14\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Wang, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yu and Ferster, 2010</a>). The magnitude and frequency of gamma-band oscillations are modulated by changes to the sensory environment (e.g. visual stimulus contrast (<a href=\"#bib24\">Henrie and Shapley, 2005</a>)\u00a0and behavioural state (e.g. attention [<a href=\"#bib20\">Fries et al., 2001</a>]) of the animal. This has led a number of authors to propose that neural oscillations play a fundamental role in cortical computation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fries, 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib17\">Engel et al., 2001</a>).

Thus, oscillations are generally seen as a bad thing for efficient rate coding, as they tend to synchronise neural responses, and thus, introduce redundancy."

To achieve this ideal, however, requires incredibly fast inhibitory connections, so that each time a neuron fires a spike it suppresses all other neurons from firing (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boerlin et al., 2013</a>). In reality, inhibitory connections are subject to unavoidable delays (e.g. synaptic and transmission delays), and thus, cannot always prevent neurons from firing together. Worse, in the presence of delays, inhibitory signals, intended to prevent neurons from firing together, can actually have the reverse effect of <i>synchronising</i> the network, so that many neurons fire together on each cycle (as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>, middle and right panels). This is analogous to the so-called \u2018hipster effect\u2019 where a group of individuals strive to look different from each other, but due to delayed reaction times, end up making similar decisions and all looking alike (<a href=\"#bib38\">Touboul and Effect, 2014</a>)."

It is thus tempting to conclude that neural networks should do everything possible to avoid synchronous firing. However, one also observes that a completely asynchronous network, in which neurons fire with independent Poisson variability (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>), performs far worse than the regular spiking network, even when multiple neurons fire together on each cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>, horizontal dashed line)."

In this regime, individual neurons fire irregularly (<a href=\"#bib35\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>)\u00a0and exhibit weak pairwise correlations (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schneidman et al., 2006</a>), despite the presence of rhythmic population activity. Moreover, excitation and inhibition are tightly balanced on each oscillation cycle, with inhibition lagging excitation by a few milliseconds (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atallah and Scanziani, 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib39\">Wehr and Zador, 2003</a>).

To do this efficiently (i.e. with as few spikes as possible), the spiking output of the network is fed-back and subtracted from its original input (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). In consequence, the total input to each neuron is equal to a \u2018prediction error\u2019; the difference between the original input and the network reconstruction. This prediction error is also reflected in neural membrane potentials. When a neuron\u2019s membrane potential becomes larger than a constant threshold, then it fires a spike; recurrent feedback then reduces the prediction error encoded by other neurons, preventing them from firing further redundant spikes."

Without delays, recurrent inhibition prevents all but one cell from firing per oscillation cycle, resulting in an optimally efficient code (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, left panel). With delays however, inhibition cannot always act fast enough to prevent neurons firing together. As a result, neural activity quickly becomes synchronised, and the sensory reconstruction is destroyed by large population-wide oscillations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, middle panel). To improve performance, one can increase the membrane potential noise and spike threshold, so as to reduce the chance of neurons firing together (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, right panel).

In order to efficiently code incoming information, neural networks must trade-off two competing demands.

On the other hand, to do this optimally, neural membrane potentials should encode shared global information about what has already been coded by the network, which will tend to synchronise neural activity."

This also corresponds to the regime in which inhibition and excitation are most tightly balanced.

This behaviour is qualitatively similar to the network dynamics observed in our model. However, these previous models differ in several ways from the model presented here. For example, they assume sparse connections (and/or weak connectivity), in which the probability of connections (and/or connection strengths) scales inversely with the number of neurons. In contrast, the connections in our network are non-sparse and finite. Thus, our network achieves a tighter balance between inhibitory and excitatory currents, and smaller fluctuations in membrane potentials (they scale as <math id=\"inf10\"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>N</mi></mrow></math> in the absence of delays, rather than <math id=\"inf11\"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><msqrt><mi>N</mi></msqrt></mrow></math>)."

This is because in cases where a very large number of neurons encode a low-dimensional input, fluctuations in firing rate due to Poisson noise can be averaged out, and thus are not a limiting factor for coding accuracy. Note that the population size at which our proposed recurrent coding scheme ceases to be advantageous depends on several factors, including the input dimensionality and average neural firing rates."

This \u2018top-down\u2019 modelling approach allows us to directly ask questions about the network dynamics that subserve optimal efficient coding. For example, balanced inhibition and excitation are not imposed in our model, but rather, required for efficient coding.

In this work, we showed that a recurrent population of integrate-and-fire neurons with dynamics and connectivity tuned for efficient coding maintains a balance between excitation and inhibition, exhibits Poisson-like spike statistics (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boerlin et al., 2013</a>), and is highly robust against perturbations such as neuronal cell death. However, we did not previously demonstrate a relation between efficient coding and neural oscillations. The main reason for this is that we always considered an idealised network, with instantaneous synapses. In this idealised network, only one cell fires at a time. As a result, oscillations are generally extremely weak and fast (with frequency equal to the population firing rate), and thus, completely washed out in a large network with added noise and/or heterogenous read-out weights. In contrast, in a network with finite synaptic delays, more than one neuron may fire per oscillation cycle, before the arrival of inhibition. As a result, oscillations are generally much stronger, even with significant added noise and/or heterogenous read-out weights."

This phenomena, where noise fluctuations increase the signal processing performance of a system, is often referred to as \u2018stochastic resonance\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Benzi et al., 1981</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib19\">Faisal et al., 2008</a>), and has been observed in multiple sensory systems, including cat visual neurons (<a href=\"#bib27\">Longtin et al., 1991</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib25\">Levin and Miller, 1996</a>). Previously however, stochastic resonance has usually been seen as a method to amplify sub-threshold sensory signals that would not normally drive neurons to spike. Here, in contrast, noise desynchronises neurons that receive similar recurrent inputs, increasing the coding efficiency of the population."

In the current paper, we address a fundamental limitation of the idealized model that emerges from the derivation, where neural feedback is both noiseless and instantaneous. We show how efficient neural coding can be performed in a network where feedback is noisy and delayed, with resulting oscillatory dynamics that resemble what is observed experimentally."

For example, neurons in our model have voltage-driven synapses, while real synapses are better approximated by conductance based models. In another study, we showed how to adapt the framework to more realistic Hodgkin Huxley neurons that included synapses with finite rise time, but no delays (<a href=\"#bib34\">Schwemmer et al., 2015</a>). Further, the slow time constant (100\u00a0ms), required in our simulations to achieve high coding performance, contrasts with the relatively fast (\u223c10\u201320\u00a0ms) membrane time constants observed experimentally. It will be important in the future to investigate how extensions to the model (such as higher-dimensional inputs and/or alternative implementations with sparse recurrent connectivity) can help recover coding performance given fast, biologically realistic, membrane time constants."

In that previous work, feedback was instantaneous. Here the authors show that if feedback is delayed (as it must be in realistic networks), oscillations develop. However, excessive synchronous network oscillations degrades coding. The central result of the manuscript is that noise mitigates some of the deleterious aspects of network-wide oscillatory synchrony on neural coding."

In the main text we illustrated how encoding performance can be recovered by adding noise (e.g. synaptic failure, additive membrane potential noise or Poisson spiking neurons). We note that coding performance can also be improved by altering other aspects of the network, such as recurrent connectivity. For example, while beyond the scope of the current work, we found that a locally connected network consisting of several overlapping inhibitory sub-populations, each of which encodes its own \u2018version\u2019 of the input, can lead to weaker oscillations, improving the performance of the \u2018all-to-all\u2019 network presented in our work."

Indeed, the value of 100 ms was used primarily to ensure consistency with our previous theoretical work (Boerlin et al. 2013, PLoS Comp), rather than for explicit biological realism. It is worth noting however, that in contrast to the simple effective integrate-and-fire (IF) model that results from deriving our framework, real neurons exhibit dynamics on multiple timescales, including slow adaptation time scales (Fairhall et al., 2001, Nature), slow inactivation dynamics of intrinsic conductances (Gilboa et al., 2015, J Neurosci), slow integration due to voltage-dependent potassium currents (Storm et al., 1988, Nature) and slower dendritic integration time-scales due to NMDA-synaptic currents (London et al., 2005, Ann. Rev. Neurosci). It is possible that these slower dynamics could account for the slow readout time, that is required by the network in order to achieve a high degree of coding precision."

In the current paper, we addressed a major inconsistency between our previous work, where synapses were noiseless and instantaneous, and biology, where synapses are noisy and delayed. Significantly, we believe that the principles that emerge extend beyond the model network, to many other recurrent systems where interacting sub-units perform a global optimization. Nonetheless, we concede that significant challenges remain in order to draw a closer connection between our top-down neural model and biology: not least the introduction of conductance based synapses and/or understanding how the multiple cellular mechanisms may lead to slow decoding time-scales in spite of fast membrane time constants."

Therefore, with other parameters (e.g. feed-forward/recurrent weights) scaled appropriately, decreasing \u03c4 is equivalent to increasing the synaptic delay. On the other hand, when all other parameters are held constant, decreasing \u03c4 serves to increase firing rates (which are inversely proportional to \u03c4), unlike varying the synaptic delay, which has no effect (compare <a href=\"#fig11\">Figures 11a and e</a>)."

However, unlike the delay, varying \u03c4 had a relatively weak effect on the oscillation frequency (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11g\u2013h</a>). Intuitively, this is because varying \u03c4 causes two different changes in network dynamics that push in different directions. On the one hand, decreasing \u03c4 results in faster integration time, speeding up the network dynamics (and thus, tending to increase oscillation frequency). On the other hand, decreasing \u03c4 increases the oscillation magnitude, leading to stronger inhibition on each oscillation cycle and tending to slow down the oscillations."
