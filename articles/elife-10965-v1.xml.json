A widespread assumption is that such interactions occur only in <i>cis</i>, between the two ends of a single transcript. However, certain translational regulatory defects of the <i>Drosophila oskar (osk)</i> mRNA can be rescued in <i>trans</i>. We proposed that inter-transcript interactions, promoted by assembly of the mRNAs in particles, allow regulatory elements to act in <i>trans</i>. Here we confirm predictions of that model and show that disruption of PTB-dependent particle assembly inhibits rescue in <i>trans</i>. Communication between transcripts is not limited to different <i>osk</i> mRNAs, as regulation imposed by <i>cis</i>-acting elements embedded in the <i>osk</i> mRNA spreads to <i>gurken</i> mRNA. We conclude that community effects exist in translational regulation."

A widespread assumption is that such interactions occur only in <i>cis</i>, between the two ends of a single transcript. However, certain translational regulatory defects of the <i>Drosophila oskar (osk)</i> mRNA can be rescued in <i>trans</i>. We proposed that inter-transcript interactions, promoted by assembly of the mRNAs in particles, allow regulatory elements to act in <i>trans</i>. Here we confirm predictions of that model and show that disruption of PTB-dependent particle assembly inhibits rescue in <i>trans</i>. Communication between transcripts is not limited to different <i>osk</i> mRNAs, as regulation imposed by <i>cis</i>-acting elements embedded in the <i>osk</i> mRNA spreads to <i>gurken</i> mRNA. We conclude that community effects exist in translational regulation."

To make a protein, the DNA within a gene is copied to produce molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) that are then used as templates to build proteins via a process called translation. This process \u2013 which involves protein machines called ribosomes binding to the start of the mRNA \u2013 is tightly regulated to control the amounts of particular proteins in cells. For example, in fruit fly ovaries, a protein called Bruno both represses and activates the translation of a gene known as <i>oskar</i>. To achieve this, Bruno binds to regions near the end of the <i>oskar</i> RNA known as Bruno response elements."

A number of molecular interactions influence the proper convergence of these parts, often involving RNA elements or factors at the opposite ends of the mRNA (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>). For example, Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) binds to the poly(A) tail at the 3\u2019 end of an mRNA (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mangus et al., 2003</a>) and enhances translation through its interaction with eIF4G, a protein associated with the 5\u2019 cap of the mRNA (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tarun et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sonenberg and Dever, 2003</a>). Similarly, many repressors of translation bind to elements in the 3\u2019 untranslated regions (3\u2019 UTRs) of mRNAs and interfere with the normal action of initiation factors at the 5\u2019 end of the mRNA (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gebauer and Hentze, 2004</a>). Such long-range protein-protein interactions, spanning the full length of the mRNA, are generally assumed to occur only in <i>cis</i>: PABP bound to the tail of one molecule of mRNA is expected to bind only the eIF4G associated with the other end of the same mRNA. In principle, however, inter-transcript interactions are also possible, and their likelihood depends on the concentration of the mRNAs. When mRNAs are dilute, intra-transcript interactions will predominate, but as the local density of mRNAs increases, inter-transcript interactions become more likely."

Following transcription in the nurse cells of each egg chamber, <i>osk</i> mRNA is transported through cytoplasmic connections to the transcriptionally-silent oocyte. Eventually, as oogenesis proceeds, <i>osk</i> mRNA localizes to the posterior pole of the oocyte, and only then does Osk protein begin to accumulate. Translation of <i>osk</i> mRNA is highly regulated: repression prevents premature translation from unlocalized mRNA, and activation turns on translation of the localized mRNA (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kim-Ha et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Markussen et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Rongo et al., 1995</a>).

Strikingly, defects in either repression (from mutation of all BREs in <i>osk ABC BRE<sup>-</sup></i>) or activation (from mutation of the C BREs in <i>osk C BRE<sup>-</sup></i>) can be rescued by the presence of another <i>osk</i> mRNA, one that itself cannot make Osk protein but has all regulatory elements intact (<a href=\"#bib36\">Reveal et al., 2010</a>)."

Bru binds Cup, a protein that competes with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E, the 5\u2019 cap-binding protein.

In our model, the Bru/Cup complex bound to the rescuing mRNA would bridge to eIF4E bound to the cap of the mRNA unable to bind Bru, thereby conferring translational repression.

However, the other contributions to assembly - mRNA dimerization and PTB-dependent RNP assembly - can be manipulated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Direct <i>osk</i> mRNA dimerization requires a RNA element (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jambor et al., 2011</a>), which is deleted in mutant <i>osk3\u2019\u2206665\u2013685</i> (labeled as <i>dimer<sup>-</sup></i> in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Testing the role of PTB-mediated assembly could be done by mutating PTB-binding sites. These sites are spread throughout the <i>osk</i> mRNA 3\u2019 UTR (as shown by RNA binding assays), although individual sites have not been defined (<a href=\"#bib3\">Besse et al., 2009</a>). However, because the binding specificity of <i>Drosophila</i> PTB is likely to be very similar or identical to that of the highly conserved mammalian homolog, for which binding sites have been characterized by a combination of approaches (<a href=\"#bib35\">P\u00e9rez et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Xue et al., 2009</a>), candidate sites can be identified (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Mutating all the candidate sites (consisting of pyrimidine tracts or PTs) is the simplest strategy to disrupt PTB binding, but introducing so many mutations increases the probability of an inadvertent effect on rescue in <i>trans</i>. To strike a balance between these design considerations, a subset of the PT sequences was mutated (<i>osk3\u2019PT<sup>mut</sup></i>)(<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), focusing on those with features associated with the strongest sites for mammalian PTB binding, while avoiding mutations that might also disrupt <i>osk</i> mRNA dimerization or Bru binding. A UV crosslinking competition binding assay was used to determine if the PT mutations affected PTB binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). PTB bound the radiolabeled <i>osk</i> mRNA 3\u2019 UTR probe mRNA (left lane). Increasing amounts of unlabeled <i>osk</i> 3\u2019 UTR RNA (<i>osk<sup>+</sup></i>) effectively competed for binding. When the competitor RNA included the PT mutations (3\u2019PTmut), competition was less effective, demonstrating that the mutations do affect PTB-binding sites."

Remarkably, the type of <i>osk</i> mRNA present did affect Grk protein levels. When only <i>osk3\u2019PT<sup>mut</sup></i> mRNA was present, Grk protein levels were higher than when <i>osk<sup>+</sup></i> mRNA was also present (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). This effect was observed in each of two separate experiments, making use of different lines of the <i>osk3\u2019PT<sup>mut</sup></i> transgene. As a control, we performed the same type of experiment with an <i>osk</i> transgene that is a strong donor for rescue of <i>osk</i> mRNA regulatory defects and found no change in Grk protein levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). The differing behaviors of the <i>osk3\u2019PT<sup>mut</sup></i> and <i>osk</i> control transgenes cannot be attributed to differences in mRNA levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Importantly, none of the <i>osk</i> mRNAs in these experiments produce any Osk protein at these stages of oogenesis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Therefore, we conclude that <i>osk</i> mRNA, not Osk protein, influences Grk expression. The increase in Grk levels when <i>osk</i> mRNA is impaired in PTB-dependent RNP assembly is consistent with the strong translational repression of <i>osk</i> mRNAs acting in <i>trans</i> to confer some degree of translational repression on <i>grk</i> mRNAs present in the same RNPs."

Instead of mutating the central position in the UUUAY pentamer from U to G (as in the original <i>osk IBE<sup>-</sup></i>mutants), each nucleotide of each pentamer was changed, and so a stronger defect in binding - to Imp or to the unknown factor - is expected.

Nevertheless, inter-transcript interactions have generally not been considered in models of translation or its regulation. The <i>osk</i> mRNA is an exception, displaying the notable property of rescue of regulatory mutations in <i>trans</i>. We suggested that this phenomenon results from inter-transcript interactions, with the participating mRNAs placed in close proximity in RNPs to facilitate the interactions. The work described here establishes parameters for this rescue in <i>trans</i>, shows that conditions which reduce RNP assembly diminish rescue in <i>trans</i> and provides evidence that regulation imposed on the <i>osk</i> mRNA influences the expression of <i>grk</i> mRNA by a similar <i>trans</i> effect.

In the context of the proposed model, mutations affecting long-range regulatory interactions should be susceptible to rescue in <i>trans</i>, while other types of regulatory defects would not. Testing new regulatory mutants as recipients, we found that three mutants with mutations in the 3\u2019 UTR could be rescued in <i>trans</i>, while a mutant with defects in the 5\u2019 region of the mRNA could not. Sensitivity of the 3\u2019 UTR regulatory elements to rescue in <i>trans</i> is consistent with their participation in long-range interactions to activate translation. In particular, the <i>osk3\u20191004\u20131008</i> mutant is defective in an A-rich element, which likely serves to bind PABP (<a href=\"#bib43\">Vazquez-Pianzola et al., 2011</a>). PABP interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF4G (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tarun et al., 1997</a>), associated with the mRNA 5\u2019 cap, and this interaction has the potential to occur between different transcripts. As for the 5\u2019 region mutant which is not rescued in <i>trans</i>, why activation of translation is defective is not understood (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kanke and Macdonald, 2015</a>), but the position of the mutations suggests a local, rather than long-range, effect on initiation of translation."

First, we find that the element missing from the recipient must be provided by the donor, as predicted by the model of 'regulation in <i>trans'</i> [but also consistent with other models - see (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wilusz and Wilusz, 2010</a>)]. Second, although the missing element is required in the donor, it is not sufficient, and additional 3\u2019 UTR sequences must be present to obtain a substantial degree of rescue. These results are also consistent with 'regulation in <i>trans'</i>, with the additional sequences presumably acting to promote interactions between the different transcripts and thus allow the missing regulatory element to act in <i>trans</i>. Third, many <i>osk</i> mRNAs can act as donors for rescue in <i>trans</i>; this appears to be the default property. Even if an <i>osk</i> mRNA is not receptive to rescue in <i>trans</i>, this does not exclude the possibility that it can act as a donor. For example, the <i>oskM1R\u2206121\u2013150</i> mutant cannot be rescued in <i>trans</i> but is a strong donor. Again, these observations are consistent with 'regulation in <i>trans'</i>, in which the donor mRNA need not itself be translated, it needs only to contain the regulatory element missing from the recipient as well as sequences that mediate association of the different mRNAs. Fourth, there are mutations which interfere with the ability of an <i>osk</i> mRNA to act as a donor for rescue in <i>trans</i>. These fall into two groups, the enigmatic IBE mutant, and the mutants designed to disrupt RNP assembly."

As a donor, the IBE mutant confers only very weak rescue of other regulatory defects. New mutants targeting the IBEs, which more substantially alter or eliminate the IBE motifs, have no regulatory defects and are strong donors for rescue in <i>trans</i>. Thus, the original IBE mutations appear to cause a dominant gain-of-function defect, perhaps by serendipitous formation of a binding site for an unknown factor. Why do the original IBE mutations in one subset of IBE motifs, the B group, have no consequences? Notably, the B group IBEs are embedded in a cluster of Bru-binding sites. We suggest that bound Bru could occlude binding of the unknown factor, thus avoiding the adverse effects. In any event, the original IBE mutants are clearly unusual and need to be considered separately from mutants which disrupt bona\u00a0fide regulatory elements. Learning how the IBE mutant inhibits rescue in <i>trans</i> may well provide important insights into the mechanism, and will be the focus of future work."

The additive nature of the PT mutations is fully consistent with the notion that they serve as binding sites for PTB, which assembles <i>osk</i> mRNA into RNPs in vitro and is required for association of <i>osk</i> mRNAs in vivo (<a href=\"#bib3\">Besse et al., 2009</a>). As an independent test of the role of PTB in rescue in <i>trans</i>, we also monitored the effects of reducing PTB gene dosage when the donor and recipient <i>osk</i> mRNAs had intact PTB-binding sites. Consistent with 'regulation in <i>trans'</i>, lowering the activity of PTB diminished rescue of the translational activation defect, leading to a lower level of Osk protein. PTB is implicated in translational repression of <i>osk</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#bib3\">Besse et al., 2009</a>), and so a reduced level of PTB could also influence Osk protein levels more directly. However, a lower efficiency of repression would increase, not lower, the level of Osk protein, and the effect we observe is more reasonably attributed to 'regulation in <i>trans'</i>."

In practice, such effects would be most likely for mRNAs in close proximity to one another, either because of an overall high mRNA concentration or because of coassembly in RNPs. To consider this possibility, we focused on the <i>grk</i> mRNA, which shares with <i>osk</i> mRNA patterns of subcellular distribution as well as association with PTB. Remarkably, removing candidate PTB-binding sites from <i>osk</i> mRNA led to elevation of Grk protein levels early in oogenesis. Because translation of <i>osk</i> mRNA is strongly repressed at this developmental stage, association of the <i>osk</i> and <i>grk</i> mRNAs could lead to some degree of translational repression of <i>grk</i>. Disrupting this association would reduce repression of <i>grk</i>, leading to higher Grk protein levels, as we observed. It is also possible that reducing the amount of PTB bound to <i>osk</i> mRNA would increase the pool of PTB available for binding to <i>grk</i>. However, if this occurs, given the evidence that PTB acts in the cytoplasm as a repressor of translation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Besse et al., 2009</a>), the expected outcome would be enhanced repression of <i>grk</i> mRNA and less Grk protein, not more."

Unless a mechanism exists to specifically exclude inter-transcription interactions, there is no compelling reason why such interactions would not occur, and their probability may be dictated by mRNA concentrations. The absence of other reports of this phenomenon may be misleading, as detecting <i>trans</i> effects is not straightforward. For <i>osk</i> mRNA, rescue in <i>trans</i> was discovered by comparing the effects of <i>cis</i> regulatory mutations in the presence or absence of other <i>osk</i> transcripts (<a href=\"#bib36\">Reveal et al., 2010</a>). To the best of our knowledge, this approach is not common. Furthermore, it requires an RNA null allele for the regulated gene, a reagent not always available. Despite the absence of direct tests for rescue in <i>trans</i>, recent advances in understanding how mRNAs are localized may be relevant. Often, localized mRNAs are subject to translational regulation to ensure that the protein is only synthesized at the appropriate time or location (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jung et al., 2014</a>). Curiously, several such mRNAs - but not <i>osk</i> - are transported in RNPs containing a single mRNA molecule (<a href=\"#bib2\">Batish et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amrute-Nayak and Bullock, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mikl et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Little et al., 2015</a>). Perhaps, such isolation of individual mRNAs serves to ensure that 'regulation in <i>trans'</i> does not occur and that regulation is constrained to that imposed by embedded <i>cis</i> elements."

Note that all late stage oocytes, having a high anterior/posterior to dorsal/ventral axial ratio, are positioned with the anterior/posterior axis parallel to the plane of the slide. This orientation ensures that a z series of images is comparable for all oocytes. A z position appearing to have the highest level of Osk::GFP signal was noted, and then a z series of images roughly centered on that position was collected. Signal intensities were determined (as described below), and plotted across the z dimension. As shown in the two oocyte examples in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, this approach was adequate to identify a z position having a signal intensity within 2% of the maximum measured intensity. To measure signal intensity of the posterior crescent of Osk::GFP, the posterior peripheral region of each oocyte was traced in FIJI using a Wacom Intuos tablet. Because oocytes differ in shape, a single standardized trace outline could not be used. When the Osk::GFP signal intensity was strong, the region to be traced was readily identified, with the boundaries of the traces extending well beyond the anterior-most signal. When Osk::GFP signal intensity was low or undetectable, a region similar in shape and size was traced. Within the traced region for each oocyte, the total signal was measured. Other options for quantitation of the posterior crescent of Osk::GFP are to determine average or maximum signal intensity. Neither provides a reliable estimate of total Osk::GFP. For an average intensity to be reliable, the area scored must be identical for all oocytes. Given the variation in oocyte shape, tracing areas identical in size is not practical. For a maximum signal intensity to be reliable, there must be a point source of Osk::GFP. This is not the case. To evaluate the consistency of the assay, a single biological sample was divided into two portion, and each was mounted on a separate slide. Both slides were imaged in a single session. Quantitation using the approach described showed a high level of consistency (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Within early oocytes Grk protein is roughly uniform in distribution, except that the protein is excluded from the nucleus. Because all samples in these experiments contain readily detectable Grk, the position of the nucleus (unstained) is obvious and the cytoplasm can be easily traced. Given the uniform distribution of Grk in the cytoplasm, measuring an average signal intensity is appropriate. By contrast, measuring the total amount of signal does not provide a reliable estimate of Grk levels, as the area of the oocyte varies substantially depending on z position. For these images, additional steps were taken to obtain similar data from all samples. First, only egg chambers oriented in a roughly horizontal position were analyzed. This ensures that the position of the nucleus (lacking Grk), and the region of the oocyte it occupies, are similar for all samples. Second, the focal plane was chosen to include the oocyte nucleus, thus avoiding the peripheral regions of the oocyte. Near the periphery, only a small portion of the oocyte is included in an optical section, which causes high variability in average signal intensity. Limiting the analysis to the more central region yielded only minor variation in measured signal intensities (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), much less than the differences observed in the experiments of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>."

First, both reviewers feel that the work is of broad interest in taking earlier observations by your group showing that BREs' can be rescued in <i>trans</i> by another mRNA transcript, and extending these observations to show that other <i>osk</i> mutations can also be rescued in a manner potentially dependent on the PTB protein (and its binding sites). And, while both reviewers are inclined to think that indeed this idea is correct (if not the complete story), both reviewers feel that additional experiments are needed to support this specific claim. Most importantly, the distribution of the mutant RNA needs better characterization in the presence and absence of PTB (i.e. in the presence of PTB binding site mutations and with diminished PTB levels). One of the reviewers proposes the use of FISH to help support the proposed mechanism \u2013 two color FISH should help correlate the observed regulatory effects with colocalization. The second reviewer proposes some IP style experiments to address a similar point (where the amount of RNAs recovered correlate with the predicted strengths of the PTB binding sites, etc.). There were other experiments proposed to ask whether the nature of the mRNA interaction was reciprocal, and whether co-regulation happens in both directions. The reviewers agree that this would be interesting, but perhaps beyond the scope of the present work."

There are two points the authors might want to show. First, these mutations may result in no or decreased PTB binding. The second might be hard to prove: so many mutations might disrupt something else. The authors also used a heterozygous mutant PTB to reduce the PTB level (is that true?).

The authors provide data that PTB is part of this mechanism but this requires further work. Part of the problem is that they rely almost exclusively on genetics, which leads to uncertainty about epistatic mechanisms leading to their observations. For instance, the increase in Gurken is interesting, but phenomenological. While the proposed mechanism of rescue is likely correct, it needs validation before the manuscript is acceptable. FISH experiments may help to support the proposed mechanism. Two color FISH will help correlate rescue with colocalization. Furthermore, this will show the importance of homotypic clustering in the granules (an approach recently described by the Lehmann lab, 2015, Nature Communications). If the FISH experiments yield the predicted result, they will suggest a mechanism where homotypic interactions are necessary for rescue.

The authors generalize their model by showing that <i>oskar</i> mRNA is capable of regulating another mRNA with which it co-localizes, <i>gurken</i>, in a manner that once again requires candidate PTB binding sites on the donor.

First, both reviewers feel that the work is of broad interest in taking earlier observations by your group showing that BREs' can be rescued in trans by another mRNA transcript, and extending these observations to show that other osk mutations can also be rescued in a manner potentially dependent on the PTB protein (and its binding sites). And, while both reviewers are inclined to think that indeed this idea is correct (if not the complete story), both reviewers feel that additional experiments are needed to support this specific claim. Most importantly, the distribution of the mutant RNA needs better characterization in the presence and absence of PTB (i.e. in the presence of PTB binding site mutations and with diminished PTB levels). One of the reviewers proposes the use of FISH to help support the proposed mechanism \u2013 two color FISH should help correlate the observed regulatory effects with colocalization. The second reviewer proposes some IP style experiments to address a similar point (where the amount of RNAs recovered correlate with the predicted strengths of the PTB binding sites, etc.). There were other experiments proposed to ask whether the nature of the mRNA interaction was reciprocal, and whether co-regulation happens in both directions. The reviewers agree that this would be interesting, but perhaps beyond the scope of the present work. In light of the broad agreement of the reviewers, we would be happy to receive a revised manuscript should there be additional experiments provided to support the proposed model that PTB binding is critical for both colocalization and coregulation, demonstrated more directly through biochemistry/visualization, and not simply through genetic approaches.</i> "

The first was that suggested by reviewer 2, doing IPs of PTB to assess binding to the various mRNAs. Unfortunately, using the only anti-<i>Drosophila</i> PTB antibodies of which we are aware (Besse et al. Genes Dev 23, 195-207), we were unable to IP PTB. In the second approach, suggested by reviewer 1, we performed RNA binding assays with recombinant <i>Drosophila</i> PTB. In the revised <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> we show that binding of PTB to the complete <i>osk</i> 3\u2019 UTR is substantially reduced by the full set of PT mutations. In the revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, we include two types of UV crosslinking binding assays. In one set of assays we used short segments of the <i>osk</i> 3\u2019 UTR to ask if the PT sites within each segment mediated PTB binding. Using these short RNAs in the binding assay allows us to focus primarily on the PT sites mutated, in the absence of residual PTB binding to the remainder of the 3\u2019 UTR. The results demonstrate that each subset of PT mutations does indeed reduce PTB binding. The second type of assay was designed to ask how strongly each subset of PT mutations disrupts PTB binding to the entire <i>osk</i> 3\u2019 UTR, similar to the situation in vivo with the transgenes bearing the same subsets of mutations. Because we expected weaker effects (many PTB sites remain intact in the context of the full 3\u2019 UTR), we used competition binding assays. The results show that subsets of the PT mutations do disrupt PTB binding. The degree to which PTB binding is reduced by each subset of mutations parallels the degree to which rescue in <i>trans</i> is reduced, at least in the sense that the subset of mutations with the greatest effect on PTB binding has the greatest effect on rescue in <i>trans</i>. The other subsets of mutations have lesser effects on both PTB binding and rescue in <i>trans</i>, but the differences within this group are relatively small and not statistically significant, and it seems unrealistic to think that we would obtain compelling evidence of a perfect correlation within this group between small differences in overall PTB binding and in rescue in <i>trans</i>. I think these experiments address the need for biochemical evidence to support the genetic data, and I hope you agree."

Genes Dev 23, 195-207) shows that <i>osk</i> mRNA localization is somewhat delayed but otherwise completely normal in egg chambers homozygous mutant for <i>heph</i>, the gene that encodes PTB. Because this is a more extreme situation than mutants heterozygous for <i>heph</i>, we cite their work but do not include experiments to monitor <i>osk</i> mRNA distribution in the <i>heph</i> heterozygotes. As for overlap in the distribution of <i>osk</i> mRNA and the GFP reporter mRNAs with <i>osk</i> 3\u2019 UTR segments, multiple studies have shown that such reporters with the complete <i>osk</i> 3\u2019 UTR are localized to the posterior pole of the oocyte just like <i>osk</i> itself (e.g. Besse et al.

There is no strong posterior localization for the GFP reporters with only parts of the 3\u2019 UTR, but the level of rescue in <i>trans</i> is extremely low for these transgenes, being detectable only in the indirect embryonic patterning assays. Thus, a low level of overlap in mRNA distributions could explain the observed rescue. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> shows that <i>osk</i> and <i>grk</i> are both highly enriched in early stage oocytes, with <i>osk</i> filling the entire oocyte.

The evidence for homotypic clustering comes from modeling, using data from different imaging experiments in which VasaGFP (protein) and single mRNAs were detected (not 2 color FISH). The modeling provides a prediction of the average distribution of mRNAs based on distance from VasaGFP, and does not exclude colocalization of fractions of the individual mRNAs. The overall conclusion from the work, which is best discerned from the Results section of Trcek et al., is that certain localized mRNAs have a bias towards homotypic clustering, but it is only a bias and is not absolute. For example, Trcek et al. state that \u201c<i>pgc</i> mRNAs preferred to co-organize with other <i>pgc</i> mRNAs rather than mix with <i>nos</i> or <i>gcl</i> mRNAs.\u201d Although a reader might be left with the impression that Trcek et al. found that different species of localized mRNAs were segregated one from another by homotypic clustering, the data do not show such a strong partitioning effect."

Thus, even if we obtained results comparable to the modeling of Trcek et al. (i.e. predicting some degree of homotypic clustering but not excluding colocalization), this would not disprove the model. Despite this argument that such experiments are unlikely to be conclusive, we would do them if they were practical. However, this would be a substantial project on its own. First, for the 2 color FISH we would have to generate an additional set of transgenic flies, so that both donor and recipient <i>osk</i> mRNAs each have their own unique sequence tags for detection (with our current transgenes, only the recipient has the unique GFP tag, while the donor mRNAs would have to be detected with an <i>osk</i> probe which would also detect the recipient mRNA). More significantly, we would have to establish a complex imaging system and develop novel reagents. It is worth noting that the Trcek et al. work involved collaboration of the Lehmann lab with two imaging labs, highlighting the technical sophistication and challenges of their approach. Furthermore, we would not simply be reproducing their assay system, as there are many differences between the tissues (embryos vs egg chambers) and the types of particles to be examined (assembled germ granules in embryos vs. the more diffuse and less highly organized germ granule precursors in developing oocytes). Notably, the reagent used for the Trcek et al. modeling studies \u2013 VasaGFP \u2013 is not suitable for our work. Vasa protein is a component of germ granules, but it is recruited by Osk protein and thus requires Osk expression (and activation of <i>osk</i> mRNA translation) as a prerequisite for assembly. We would need to develop an alternate reagent that could be used as a reference point for defining spatial organization, and it isn\u2019t clear what molecule would have the required properties. The best candidate would be Osk protein itself, but this isn\u2019t a viable option given that our experiments involve effects on Osk protein expression. We can\u2019t simply add an Osk::GFP marker, as getting the protein expressed at the right position would require that it have the normal osk regulatory elements, which would then influence the expression of the mRNAs we are studying."

This would add a layer of complexity to our current understanding of post-transcriptional regulation, making the regulatory space accessible by such mRNAs much larger, and even more combinatorial in nature than previously thought.

However, earlier experiments in this manuscript have shown that rescue in trans is not limited to the BREs, so that other mRNA constructs are available to test this. For example, the rescue of osk 3'1004-1008 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) by different donors with or without oligomerization elements could be assayed in a similar manner as the osk C BRE<sup>-</sup> used in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>.</i> We had hoped to take exactly this approach to test for a contribution of Bru binding sites to rescue in <i>trans</i>. Unfortunately, rescue in <i>trans</i> is very weak when both donor and recipient mRNAs have mutations in the cluster of regulatory sites near the 3\u2019 end of the <i>osk</i> mRNA 3\u2019 UTR. For example, co-expression of the <i>osk C BRE</i><sup>-</sup> mutant and the <i>osk3\u20191004-1008</i> mutant results in only very weak rescue in <i>trans</i>. This is perhaps not surprising, as the mutated sites are very close together and they may act in concert to assemble a regulatory complex."

Although this might appear to provide support for Bru-mediated oligomerization in rescue in <i>trans</i>, the fact that the C region BRE mutations have the same effect does not allow us to draw that conclusion."

That is, does mutation of the predicted PTs in the grk transcript lead to an increase in wild-type Osk protein levels? If the proposed mechanism of community regulation for transcripts in close proximity is true, effects of regulation in trans should be observed in both directions: osk and grk in close proximity would cross-regulate.</i> "

                    "text": "Although this appears to be a logical extension to our work, the problem with the experiment is that <i>grk</i> mRNA is not strongly repressed. At early stages of oogenesis no Osk protein can be detected because repression is strong, while Grk protein is present (and is required) and so must be translated. There may be some degree of translational repression of <i>grk</i> mRNA (and Bru binds to <i>grk</i> mRNA, but much more weakly than Bru binds <i>osk</i> mRNA; Kim-Ha et al. Cell 81, 403-412; Filardo and Ephrussi, Mech Dev 120, 289-297), but it is clearly not the strong repression imposed on <i>osk</i> mRNA. Consistent with this, a GFP reporter mRNA with the <i>grk</i> 3\u2019 UTR attached retains very strong GFP expression (our unpublished data), while adding either part of the <i>osk</i> 3\u2019 UTR with BREs to the same GFP reporter largely eliminates GFP expression (Reveal et al. Dev Cell 18,496-502). Consequently, there is only a low level of direct repression of <i>grk</i> mRNA that has the potential to be exerted in <i>trans</i>, and this would be a very minor amount relative to the already strong repression of <i>osk</i> mRNA translation conferred in <i>cis</i> by the BREs."
