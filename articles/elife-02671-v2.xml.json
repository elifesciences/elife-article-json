Ventral anterior homeobox 1 (Vax1) plays an essential role in the development of the OC by regulating RGC axon growth in a non-cell autonomous manner. In this study, we identify an unexpected function of Vax1 that is secreted from ventral hypothalamic cells and diffuses to RGC axons, where it promotes axonal growth independent of its transcription factor activity. We demonstrate that Vax1 binds to extracellular sugar groups of the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) located in RGC axons. Both Vax1 binding to HSPGs and subsequent penetration into the axoplasm, where Vax1 activates local protein synthesis, are required for RGC axonal growth. Together, our findings demonstrate that Vax1 possesses a novel RGC axon growth factor activity that is critical for the development of the mammalian binocular visual system."

Ventral anterior homeobox 1 (Vax1) plays an essential role in the development of the OC by regulating RGC axon growth in a non-cell autonomous manner. In this study, we identify an unexpected function of Vax1 that is secreted from ventral hypothalamic cells and diffuses to RGC axons, where it promotes axonal growth independent of its transcription factor activity. We demonstrate that Vax1 binds to extracellular sugar groups of the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) located in RGC axons. Both Vax1 binding to HSPGs and subsequent penetration into the axoplasm, where Vax1 activates local protein synthesis, are required for RGC axonal growth. Together, our findings demonstrate that Vax1 possesses a novel RGC axon growth factor activity that is critical for the development of the mammalian binocular visual system."

As the axons grow, various \u2018guidance\u2019 molecules direct the axons to the correct part of the brain."

This protein is a transcription factor and binds to DNA to control how and when the molecular templates used to make proteins are made\u2014a process called transcription. Vax1 is not produced in retinal ganglion cells, but it does control the extension of these cells' axons into part of the brain called the ventral hypothalamus. In this study, the axons cross to the other side of the brain by forming a structure called optic chiasm. Humans and mice lacking Vax1 are unable to develop the optic chiasm, and the axons of their retinal ganglion cells do not reach their targets in the brain. These defects were thought to occur because the guidance molecules whose transcription is normally controlled by Vax1 were not produced in the correct amounts when Vax1 is absent."

Retinal ganglion cell axons could still grow correctly when they were put close to cells expressing this version of the Vax1 protein. This contradicts a hypothesis that Vax1 supports axonal growth by transcribing guidance molecules. Kim et al. followed up these results by examining developing mice and reached the unexpected conclusion that Vax1 is secreted from cells in the ventral hypothalamus and binds to a type of sugar molecule found on the surface of the axons. Once bound, Vax1 can enter the axons where it appears to stimulate the production of proteins inside axons, which helps the axons to grow."

To access their synaptic targets, RGC axons exit from the retina and grow in selective directions by recognizing guidance cues expressed in optic pathway structures, including the optic disc (OD), optic stalk (OS), optic chiasm (OC), and optic tract (OT) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Petros et al., 2008</a>). RGC axon guidance cues include cell surface ligands such as semaphorins in the OS and ephrinB2 in the OC, and soluble factors such as netrin-1 in the OD and Slit1 in areas surrounding the OC (<a href=\"#bib11\">Erskine and Herrera, 2007</a>). Ultimately, only about 3% of mouse RGC axons, which originate from the ventral and temporal part of the retina, are linked to targets on the same side of the brain, whereas a majority of RGC axons are connected to those on the opposite side after crossing the midline at the OC, located at the ventral-medial hypothalamic (vHT) area."

In addition, vascular endothelial growth factor 164 (VEGF164), an isoform of the vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF-A (<a href=\"#bib39\">Soker et al., 1996</a>), and neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM) expressed in the vHT have been suggested to support the growth of RGC axons across the vHT midline by binding to neuropilin-1 and plexin-A1, respectively (<a href=\"#bib46\">Williams et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Erskine et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kuwajima et al., 2012</a>).

However, Vax1 binding to HSPGs was not sufficient to trigger RGC axon growth; penetration into the RGC axoplasm and subsequent stimulation of local protein synthesis were also necessary.

These axonal Vax1-immunostaining signals were remarkably decreased in the presence of a rabbit anti-Vax1 polyclonal antibody (\u03b1-Vax1) that sequesters Vax1 in the growth medium (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Time-lapse recordings of RGC axons revealed that fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled, His-tagged Vax1 (Vax1-His) protein added to the growth medium of retinal explants accumulated in RGC axons and exerted strong growth stimulatory effects on them (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1\u20133</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The transcriptionally inactive Vax1(R152S)-His mutant protein was also detectable in RGC axons and stimulated axonal growth as efficiently as WT Vax1-His (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), suggesting that extracellular Vax1 moves to RGC axons and induces axonal growth in transcription-independent manner. Despite that Vax2 is not secreted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), the ability of recombinant Vax2-His to be internalized and induce RGC axonal growth is almost equivalent to that of Vax1 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), implicating that internalization but not secretion is a conserved characteristic of VAX transcription factors."

As reported previously (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hallonet et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bertuzzi et al., 1999</a>), <i>Vax1</i> mRNA is expressed in RGC axon-associated structures, including the OD, the OS, and the vHT, but not the retina, of E14.5 mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, an examination of Vax1 protein distribution in E14.5 <i>Vax1</i><sup><i>lacZ/+</i></sup> heterozygous mouse embryos showed that Vax1 was detectable in the retina as well as the OS and OD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, top row). In these mice, \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) is expressed from a <i>lacZ</i> gene replacing one <i>Vax1</i> gene locus while Vax1 is expressed from the other intact <i>Vax1</i> gene locus (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hallonet et al., 1999</a>); therefore, \u03b2-gal should be expressed in cells expressing Vax1. However, we found that RGCs in <i>Vax1</i><sup><i>lacZ/+</i></sup> mice did not express \u03b2-gal but did express Vax1, this contrasts with OS APCs which co-expressed Vax1 and \u03b2-gal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, top row). Vax1-immunostaining signals were completely absent in RGCs as well as \u03b2-gal-positive OS APCs from homozygous <i>lacZ</i> knock-in (<i>Vax1</i><sup><i>lacZ/lacZ</i></sup>) <i>Vax1</i><sup><i>lacZ/lacZ</i></sup> littermates, suggesting that Vax1 immunostaining signals in the <i>Vax1</i><sup><i>lacZ/+</i></sup> mouse RGC were specific (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, bottom row). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Vax1 protein in RGCs might originate from the neighboring Vax1/\u03b2-gal double-positive APCs in the OS or NPCs and radial glia in the vHT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

This in situ hybridization signal was absent in <i>Vax1</i><sup><i>lacZ/lacZ</i></sup> homozygous knock-in mouse eyes (bottom).

Vax1 protein detected in <i>Vax1</i><sup><i>lacZ/+</i></sup> mouse retinal cells, where \u03b2-gal signals were absent, is presumed to originate from external sources that co-express Vax1 and \u03b2-gal.

It is therefore possible that Vax1 stimulates RGC axonal growth either by acting as a ligand for HSPGs or by regulating cytoplasmic events after penetration. To answer this question, we tested the function of a Vax1(WF/SR) mutant, in which conserved Trp147 and Phe148 amino acids responsible for cell penetration were replaced with Ser167 and Arg148 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Joliot et al., 1998</a>); this mutant lacks the ability to cross the cell membrane but remains capable of binding to Sdc2 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

Spinal commissural axons are prevented from prematurely entering the midline by Slit1 expressed in the medial spinal cord and grow in the ventral direction (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stein and Tessier-Lavigne, 2001</a>). In much the same way, Slit1 in the preoptic area and ventral-lateral diencephalon prevents RGC axons from accessing the brain anywhere but at the vHT to form the OC (<a href=\"#bib13\">Erskine et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Plump et al., 2002</a>). The spinal commissural axons sense attractive cues, such as netrin and Shh, secreted from the FP (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stein and Tessier-Lavigne, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Charron et al., 2003</a>). The attractive netrin and Shh signals are expected to compete with the co-existing repulsive signal of Slit2, which can be accumulated locally by HSPGs, including \u03b1-dystroglycan, at the ventral FP (vFP), to determine the directionality of spinal commissural axon growth cones (<a href=\"#bib27\">Matsumoto et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wright et al., 2012</a>). RGC-expressed HSPGs were also reported to play roles as co-receptors for netrin and Slit (<a href=\"#bib18\">Johnson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hussain et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Piper et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ogata-Iwao et al., 2011</a>), suggesting a similar HSPG-based antagonistic regulation of RGC axon growth. However, both netrin and Shh are dispensable with respect to attracting RGC axons toward the vHT and instead function as repulsive cues for RGC axons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deiner and Sretavan, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sanchez-Camacho and Bovolenta, 2008</a>). In this study, we propose vHT-secreted Vax1 as a RGC axon growth factor that is analogous to vFP-secreted netrin and Shh. This unconventional axon growth factor also utilizes HSPGs for anchoring to RGC axons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) and could compete with Slit for HSPGs binding in vitro (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, it is unclear whether this competition is valid in physiological conditions because Slit does not inhibit RGC axon growth toward the vHT midline (<a href=\"#bib13\">Erskine et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Plump et al., 2002</a>). Moreover, cell penetration-defective Vax1(WF/SR) mutant could not induce RGC axon growth in vivo as well as in vitro, despite of its capability of HSPG binding (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8 and 9</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It suggests that HSPG binding of Vax1 is not sufficient to induce RGC axon growth but local protein synthesis induced by internalized Vax1 is necessary. Collectively, we propose a hypothetical model that Vax1 promotes RGC axon growth towards the vHT midline by directly targeting mRNA in the axons rather than by serving for a conventional axon guidance molecule that binds specific receptors and triggers on intracellular signaling cascades (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Identification of axonal target mRNA awaits future investigations."

The imported Vax1 in RGC axoplasm not only promotes axonal growth towards the vHT, but it also enhances fasciculation of RGC axons. This axon growth stimulatory activity of Vax1 supports sustained RGC axon growth to the vHT midline after the axons were avoided from progressing to dorsal diencephalon, which expresses high concentration of Slit repulsive axon guidance cue (<b>C</b>, top). Therefore, RGC axons stop at the lateral wall of <i>Vax1-ko</i> mouse diencephalon and fail to access the midline (<b>C</b>, bottom). At the vHT midline, RGC axon guidance cues, including VEGF164, NrCAM, and ephrinB2, determine the directionalities of RGC axon growth cones by acting their specific receptors (<b>D</b>).

Unlike Vax1, Vax2 undergoes a specific phosphorylation that results in its cytoplasmic retention (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kim and Lemke, 2006</a>). Phosphorylation of En2 inhibits its secretion (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maizel et al., 2002</a>), suggesting that the phosphorylation might change the structure of these proteins in such a way that it interferes with homeodomain recognition by secretion regulators. However, phosphorylation-defective Vax1(S170A) was still unable to be secreted from COS7 cells (data not shown). Instead, Vax2 could be secreted from different types of cells, where Vax2 might form three-dimensional structures that can be recognizable by secretion machineries (<i>Lee et al., unpublished data</i>).

Whether axonal growth of these commissural axons in the mammalian forebrain also requires local protein synthesis triggered by Vax1 protein secreted from cells located in other midline structures, such as the ventral-medial telencephalon and the septum, is a question that warrants further investigation."

The authors report that despite the lack of Vax1 mRNA expression in RGCs, they detect Vax1 protein in RGCs in vivo. The authors utilize in vitro experiments to demonstrate that Vax1 functions in a non-cell autonomous manner and, similar to other homeobox transcription factors, Vax1 can be secreted. The authors go on to show that similar to En-2, Vax1 is internalized by RGC axons, where it stimulates axonal outgrowth in a transcription-independent manner by upregulating axonal translation. The authors also perform a screen in drosophila for molecules that mediate the intercellular transfer of Vax1 and identify HSPGs as critical for Vax1 function. Finally, the authors perform in vivo rescue experiments in Vax1 knockout mice to show that wildtype Vax1 in the 3rd ventricle can increase RGC growth, whereas a mutant version of Vax1 that cannot penetrate RGC axons fails to rescue. Taken together, these data lead the authors to propose a model in which Vax1, secreted from external sources such as the radial glia in the optic chiasm, can penetrate RGCs in an HSPG dependent manner to upregulate local translation in axons to positively regulate their outgrowth."

Similarly, there is no information on localization of HSPGs on RGCs nor is there any proposal/analysis on the fate of HSPGs after Vax1 binds: are they also internalized? If not, are they cleaved once bound to Vax1? These points should be discussed. A large number of HSPG binding proteins have been identified (e.g. FGF2, slit2, Semas, ephrins, syndecans, glypicans, etc). For all these cues HSPGs function as co-receptors for a transmembrane spanning signaling receptor. The authors should discuss this possibility and whether there is data for co-localization of these on RGCs."

Slits are thought to inhibit RGC axons from straying (defasciculating) from the main bundles at the chiasm, in an \u201cinhibition-surround\u201d mechanism, not as an inhibitory molecule at the crossing point (see Erskine et al., J Neurosci 2000, 20:4975; <a href=\"#bib34\">Plump et al., 2002</a> Neuron 33:219). The authors placed Vax-1-containing cells in the third ventricle above the chiasm in an isolated prep, showing that growth was enhanced, and application of Fc-Robo3 also enhanced RGC axon growth (together growth was further enhanced). While this experiment argues for Slit involvement in this preparation, it cannot relate to guidance in vivo because Robo3 is not expressed in the mouse retina (see above references and Thompson et al., 2006, J Neurosci 26:8092). Further, there should be axon extension in the control preparation in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>. Finally, the model posed in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> is misleading: how would the Vax1-HSPG interaction act on Slit inhibition leading to action of molecules important for contralateral crossing (e.g., VEGF164, NrCAM, and Semaphorin6D, latter, erroneously indicated for ipsilateral growth)?"

This is somewhat surprising, since the domains that regulate secretion of homeodomain transcription factors are typically within the homeodomain region, which is highly conserved between Vax1 and Vax2. Have the authors attempted to identify the specific domains required for secretion and HSPG binding that differ between Vax1 and Vax2? The authors should test whether the addition of exogenous Vax2 can bind to RGCs and promote their outgrowth using assays like those used in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>."

With respect to Vax localization and uptake, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a> shows immunostaining for Vax1 protein on axons and in D in the immune-EM figures, only on the axon surface; this is puzzling as the authors' model is that Vax1 is internalized and thus one would expect Vax1 to be in the cytoplasm of the cell <i>\u2013</i> axon or cell body."
