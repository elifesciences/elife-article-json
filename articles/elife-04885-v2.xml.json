Here, we demonstrate engineering of electrically and chemically responsive, contractile human muscle tissues (\u2018myobundles\u2019) using primary myogenic cells. These biomimetic constructs exhibit aligned architecture, multinucleated and striated myofibers, and a Pax7<sup>+</sup> cell pool. They contract spontaneously and respond to electrical stimuli with twitch and tetanic contractions. Positive correlation between contractile force and GCaMP6-reported calcium responses enables non-invasive tracking of myobundle function and drug response. During culture, myobundles maintain functional acetylcholine receptors and structurally and functionally mature, evidenced by increased myofiber diameter and improved calcium handling and contractile strength. In response to diversely acting drugs, myobundles undergo dose-dependent hypertrophy or toxic myopathy similar to clinical outcomes. Human myobundles provide an enabling platform for predictive drug and toxicology screening and development of novel therapeutics for muscle-related disorders."

While significant progress has been made towards predictive in vitro models for liver, lung, and cardiac tissues (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bhatia and Ingber, 2014</a>), a functional model of human skeletal muscle has not been described. This is of particular concern as there are a wide range of metabolic, neuromuscular, and dystrophic disorders involving skeletal muscle that are under investigation and still lacking therapies. Skeletal muscle is also central to diseases with high societal impact and those that do not have adequate animal models, including diabetes, obesity, and different dystrophies. Furthermore, through secretion of contraction-dependent myokines, skeletal muscle has been strongly implicated in organ\u2013organ interactions including processes as diverse as cognition, inflammation, cancer, and aging (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012</a>).

Conditions for primary myogenic cell expansion and 3D tissue formation were optimized to reproducibly obtain contractile myobundles consisting of aligned, cross-striated myofibers and a pool of cells expressing the satellite cell marker Pax7. In response to electrical and pharmacological stimuli, myobundles exhibited forceful contractions and calcium transients which could be non-invasively measured to track physiological responses and functional maturation over time. Reproducible functional characteristics were obtained using cells from nine different donors and one commercial source. Similar to clinical outcomes in humans, when pharmaceutically challenged, myobundles experienced enhanced contractile performance in response to a steroid-like substance, underwent autophagic myopathy following administration of an anti-malarial agent, and exhibited statin-induced weakness and lipid accumulation."

Engineered human skeletal muscle \u2018myobundles\u2019 were generated using a hydrogel molding technique (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) we developed for rodent cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hinds et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Juhas et al., 2014</a>). Following hydrogel compaction for 3\u20135 days, low serum media was applied to induce myofiber formation and differentiation. After an additional 3\u20135 days, the myobundles began to spontaneously twitch (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), which was previously reported only in rodent 3D muscle constructs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dennis and Kosnik, 2000</a>). After 2-week culture, the myobundles contained densely packed and aligned myofibers embedded in a laminin-rich matrix (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and surrounded at the periphery by vimentin<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>). Mature structure of the myofibers was evident by the expression of myosin heavy chain (MYH), sarcomeric alpha-actinin (SAA) cross-striations, and multiple myogenin<sup>+</sup> nuclei (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C</a>). Of functional importance, acetylcholine receptors, which are necessary for neuromuscular junction formation, were present at the myofiber surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). While the majority of expanded myogenic cells fused to form myofibers, a fraction of cells continued to express the satellite cell marker Pax7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), suggesting regenerative capacity as described in a rat culture model (<a href=\"#bib22\">Juhas et al., 2014</a>). With time in culture, structural maturation of myobundles was evident from the progressive increase in myofiber diameter (13.5 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5m and 21.8 \u00b1 2.8 \u00b5m at 1 and 4 weeks of culture, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>) and expression of the muscle-specific proteins (MYH, SAA, and muscle creatine kinase (MCK), <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>), while myofiber length and myonuclei number (524 \u00b1 70 and 7 \u00b1 3.6, respectively, at 3 weeks of differentiation) remained relatively steady with time of culture (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

To optimize contractile force output of myobundles, myogenic cells were expanded in media containing either bFGF (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ham et al., 1988</a>) or EGF (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cheng et al., 2014</a>). Despite comparable myoblast purity and myofiber formation in 2D culture, myobundles made of EGF-expanded cells had superior contractile function (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition to spontaneous contractions, myobundles also contracted in response to electrical stimulation (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>) and, similar to native muscle (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rassier et al., 1999</a>), exhibited stronger contraction with an increase in stimulation frequency and myobundle length (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Expanded myogenic cells were lentivirally transduced with a calcium indicator, GCaMP6 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2013</a>), driven by a muscle-specific promoter, MHCK7 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Salva et al., 2007</a>), prior to myobundle formation.

In response to 10 Hz (tetanic) vs single (twitch) stimuli, the amplitude of calcium transients increased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>), as measured by normalized change in fluorescence intensity (\u0394F/F), similar to the increase in contractile force with tetanic stimulation.

Statins are widely prescribed to prevent coronary artery disease, however even at normal doses some of them can induce significant myopathic weakness and rhabdomyolysis after as early as 2 weeks of use (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dobkin, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Thompson et al., 2006</a>). We tested the effects of lovastatin and cerivastatin at their clinically-relevant dose ranges (100-fold higher for lovastatin due its lower bioavailability and bioactivity [<a href=\"#bib24\">Kantola et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shitara and Sugiyama, 2006</a>]) encompassing both maximum therapeutic blood serum concentrations and higher doses known to accelerate myopathic induction (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dobkin, 2005</a>). In our studies, 2-week application of each statin was well tolerated in the myobundles derived from two of three donors at their respective therapeutic doses, while higher doses induced significant contractile weakness in the myobundles from all donors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). Unlike human myobundles that replicated clinical response, murine engineered muscle tissues in previous studies exhibited a sharp decrease in contractile function even at the lowest statin dose tested (<a href=\"#bib43\">Vandenburgh et al., 2008</a>). Human myobundles also recapitulated the histopathology of statin-associated myopathy characterized by dose-dependent lipid accumulation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Thompson et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

While 2D and 3D cultures can be used to form de novo muscle fibers from human myogenic cells, existing methods fail to reproduce a comprehensive range of myofiber physiological responses, such as twitch, tetanus, and chemically induced contractions. Compared to previous 3D culture studies (<a href=\"#bib33\">Powell et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mudera et al., 2010</a>), a relatively high cell density, specific hydrogel and media compositions, and dynamic culture conditions (<a href=\"#bib21\">Juhas and Bursac, 2014</a>) used in our system may have all contributed to the robust formation of functional human engineered muscle. Under these conditions, the ability to generate large numbers (&gt;1000) of contractile myobundles from a single donor biopsy allowed us to perform traditional physiological and biochemical measurements in both acute and chronic settings and for multiple testing compounds and conditions. Electrically induced calcium transients and contractions (twitch and tetanus) as well as physiological responses to increase in muscle length and stimulation frequency (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rassier et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2014</a>) were reproducibly recorded in myobundles from ten donors. The specific blockade of acetylcholine-induced but not electrically-induced calcium release by the muscle relaxant and acetylcholine receptor blocker tubocurarine mimicked responses seen in human studies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Secher et al., 1982</a>). Along with dose-dependent increase in calcium transient amplitude by caffeine, these experiments demonstrate that myofibers formed within the 3D myobundle culture environment exhibited intact excitation-contraction coupling and physiological responsiveness to both chemical and electrical stimuli. While repeated non-invasive interrogation of myobundle function was limited to calcium imaging, integration of smaller size myobundles with high-throughput force testing assays should be feasible as demonstrated for mouse cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Vandenburgh et al., 2008</a>)."

Statin myopathy is a common side effect that has been reported for all currently available statins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dobkin, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Thompson et al., 2006</a>). Similar to clinical reports, human myobundles showed higher sensitivity to cerivastatin than lovastatin (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shitara and Sugiyama, 2006</a>) and at excessive statin concentrations displayed progressive weakness and lipid accumulation, suggestive of equivalent mechanisms of action in vitro and in vivo. The use of myobundles allowed direct comparison of similar pharmaceuticals on the same patient or cohort, previously recommended for but unavailable for statins due to the variations among clinical trials and underreporting of symptoms (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dobkin, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Thompson et al., 2006</a>). In response to an anti-malarial agent, chloroquine, myobundles showed induction of autophagic myopathy also observed in native muscle (<a href=\"#bib39\">Shintani and Klionsky, 2004</a>), thus providing a potential functional screen for non-toxic modulators of autophagy. We also tested the acute and chronic responses of myobundles to \u03b22-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol and observed myofiber hypertrophy and increased contractile strength at low clenbuterol doses followed by muscle weakness at higher doses, consistent with previous animal and human studies (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ryall and Lynch, 2008</a>). Currently, binding affinity to \u03b22-adrenergic receptors is one of the standard tests for drug specificity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bowes et al., 2012</a>) and is also a potential target for therapies in muscle wasting disorders (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ryall and Lynch, 2008</a>). Overall, these results suggest that myobundles closely mimic the functional responses of native human muscle through multiple signaling pathways and could provide a pre-clinical assay for predictive screening of novel therapeutics for a broad range of muscle-related disorders."

The ability to measure and quantify functional endpoints in myobundles in a population- or patient-specific manner allows construction of pharmacological time- and dose\u2013response curves previously not available for human skeletal muscle. The myobundles may be integrated with other established human micro-organ systems such as liver or heart for more predictive body-on-chip toxicology studies (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bhatia and Ingber, 2014</a>). Functional acetylcholine receptors within myobundles are integral to studies involving the neuromuscular junctions and necessary for potential implantation of such tissues to repair muscle dysfunction or loss. Eventual applications of myobundle platform using patient-derived cells to model functional deficits observed in different muscle pathologies may allow development of more efficacious therapies and safe translation to clinics."

Expanded myogenic cells were dissociated in 0.025% trypsin-EDTA to a single cell suspension and encapsulated in a fibrinogen (Akron, Boca Raton, FL) and matrigel solution on laser cut Cerex frames (9.2 \u00d7 9.5 mm outer dimensions, 6.8 \u00d7 8.3 mm inner dimensions) within PDMS molds (cast from Teflon masters and pretreated with pluronic) at 15 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml (7.5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cells per myobundle). Specifically, a cell solution (7.5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cells in 17.2 \u00b5l media per bundle + 2 \u00b5l of 50 unit/ml thrombin in 0.1% BSA in PBS [Sigma, St. Louis, MO]) and a gelling solution (11 \u00b5l media + 10 \u00b5l Matrigel + 10 \u00b5l of 20 mg/ml Fibrinogen in DMEM) were prepared in separate vials on ice for up to six myobundles per vial. Gelling solution was added to the cell solution and mixed thoroughly then each bundle was individual pipetted within the PDMS mold and onto the frame. The cell/hydrogel mixture was polymerized for 30 min at 37\u00b0C followed by incubation in growth media containing 1.5 mg/ml 6-aminocaproic acid (ACA, Sigma). Myobundles were kept in growth media during gel compaction (3\u20135 days) and then switched to low glucose DMEM with 2% horse serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mg/ml ACA and 10 \u00b5g/ml insulin (Sigma). Frames were removed from molds at the time of switch to low serum medium and cultured dynamically in suspension for an additional 1\u20134 weeks. Starting from a 50 mg donor biopsy, typical cell expansion for 5 passages can allow generation of at least 1000 myobundles with a total mass of &gt;5 g, representing a &gt;100-fold amplification of muscle mass when going from native to engineered tissue system."

Briefly, single myobundles on a frame were transferred to the bath of the force measurement set-up, maintained at 37\u00b0C. One end of the bundle was secured by a pin to an immobile PDMS block and the other end was attached to a PDMS float connected to the force transducer mounted on a computer-controlled motorized linear actuator (Thor Labs, Newton, NJ). The sides of the frame were cut to allow myobundle stretch by the actuator and isometric measurement of contractile force. Initially, the myobundle was set to its baseline length using the motorized linear actuator. To assess the force-length relationship, myobundle was stretched by 2% of its culture length then stimulated by a 40 V/cm, 10 ms electrical pulse using a pair of platinum electrodes and the twitch force was recorded. At 12% stretch, 1 s long stimulations at 5, 10, and 20 Hz were applied and the subsequent contractile force was recorded to assess the force-frequency relationship. Contractile force traces were analyzed for peak twitch or tetanus force, time to peak twitch, and half relaxation time using a custom MATLAB program (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Source code 1</a>). For studies with acetylcholine, 60 \u00b5l of drug solution was added to the 6 ml bath at t = 5 s of recording."

One end of the bundle was secured by a pin to an immobile PDMS block and the other end was attached to a PDMS float connected to the force transducer mounted on a computer-controlled motorized linear actuator (Thor Labs). The sides of the frame were cut to allow myobundle stretch by the actuator and isometric measurement of contractile force. Initially, the myobundle was set to its baseline length using the motorized linear actuator. To assess the force-length relationship, myobundle was stretched by 2% of its culture length then stimulated by a 40V/cm, 10 ms electrical pulse using a pair of platinum electrodes and the twitch force was recorded. At 12% stretch, 1 second long stimulations at 5, 10, and 20 Hz were applied and the subsequent contractile force was recorded to assess the force-frequency relationship. Contractile force traces were analyzed for peak twitch or tetanus force, time to peak twitch, and half relaxation time using a custom MATLAB program.

Uniform fiber alignment is also evident from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 3B,C</a>. In addition, we have performed new and non-trivial experiments to quantify fiber length and number of myonuclei per fiber. Specifically, to be able to evaluate length of individual fibers within the intact myobundles, we have applied a low concentration of a lentivirus driving the GFP expression under an MHCK7 promoter to transduce 5% of myogenic cells before encapsulating them in hydrogel. This low level of GFP labeling resulted in appearance of clearly distinguishable individual GFP+ fibers within myobundles. These fibers were imaged by confocal microscopy and their length and number of myonuclei were evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 weeks post-differentiation. New <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 4</a> shows the representative images of the labeled fibers and corresponding average lengths and myonuclei numbers.
