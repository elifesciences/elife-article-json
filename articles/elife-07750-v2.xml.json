Ku binding to yeast telomerase RNA promotes telomere lengthening and telomerase recruitment to telomeres, but how this is achieved remains unknown. Using telomere-length analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that Sir4\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a previously identified Ku-binding protein that is a component of telomeric silent chromatin\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is required for Ku-mediated telomere lengthening and telomerase recruitment. We also find that specifically tethering Sir4 directly to Ku-binding-defective telomerase RNA restores otherwise-shortened telomeres to wild-type length. These findings suggest that Sir4 is the telomere-bound target of Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment and provide one mechanism for how the Sir4-competing Rif1 and Rif2 proteins negatively regulate telomere length in yeast."

In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, telomeric silent chromatin is largely composed of the histone deacetylase Sir2 and structural components, Sir3 and Sir4. Complexes of these three proteins are recruited to telomeric DNA in part by the DNA-binding protein Rap1, which interacts with Sir3 and Sir4 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Moretti et al., 1994</a>). Sir2/3/4 complexes then associate with hypoacetylated H3 and H4 tails from telomeric into subtelomeric regions (<a href=\"#bib35\">Luo et al., 2002</a>) and can cause silencing of telomere-proximal genes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gottschling et al., 1990</a>). In addition to the Sir2/3/4 complex, telomeric silencing also requires the Ku heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boulton and Jackson, 1998</a>), a highly conserved DNA end-binding complex of the proteins Ku70 and Ku80 (Yku70 and Yku80 in yeast) well known for its function in non-homologous end-joining. Ku binds telomeres (<a href=\"#bib37\">Martin et al., 1999</a>) and has been found to interact with Sir4 in two-hybrid screens as well as by co-immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tsukamoto et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Roy et al., 2004</a>).

In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, Ku binds to the tip of a 74-nt hairpin in the 1157-nt telomerase RNA, TLC1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Peterson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Stellwagen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dandjinou et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zappulla and Cech, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dalby et al., 2013</a>).

Lack of Ku binding to TLC1 has also been reported to reduce nuclear localization of TLC1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gallardo et al., 2008</a>) and recruitment of telomerase to telomeres (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fisher et al., 2004</a>). Also important for telomerase recruitment to telomeres is the protein Est1. Est1 was the first telomerase subunit identified (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lundblad and Szostak, 1989</a>) and is required for recruiting telomerase to telomeres through an interaction with the single-stranded telomeric DNA-binding protein Cdc13 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Evans and Lundblad, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Qi and Zakian, 2000</a>).

However, this model has been largely discounted by in vitro binding experiments showing that purified Ku cannot bind DNA and RNA concurrently (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pfingsten et al., 2012</a>). It therefore seemed likely to us that Ku recruits telomerase to telomeres by interacting with a telomere-associated protein. Such a protein must bind Ku and associate with telomeres. Knowing that Ku also plays a role in the formation of telomeric silent chromatin, we chose to investigate its binding partner in this process, the protein Sir4, as a possible candidate. Sir4 associates with telomeres, and as mentioned above, an interaction between Sir4 and Ku has been reported previously (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tsukamoto et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Roy et al., 2004</a>). Additionally, <i>sir4</i>\u0394 cells have been shown to have shortened telomeres (<a href=\"#bib46\">Palladino et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Askree et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gatbonton et al., 2006</a>), although the cause of this phenotype has remained apparently unexplored."

In contrast, the negative regulators of telomerase, Rif1 and Rif2, which compete with Sir3 and Sir4 for binding to Rap1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Moretti et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wotton and Shore, 1997</a>), appear to inhibit Ku-mediated telomere lengthening. By measuring telomerase recruitment to telomeres by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we find that a TLC1 RNA containing three Ku-binding sites, TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub>, causes increased telomerase recruitment in wild-type cells. Furthermore, <i>sir4</i>\u0394 cells display a defect in telomerase recruitment indistinguishable from that of <i>tlc1</i>\u0394<i>48</i> cells, even when expressing TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub>. Finally, we show that tethering Sir4 directly to tlc\u039448 RNA restores telomeres to wild-type length, while tethering Sir3 to tlc1\u039448 does not. Together, these results suggest that Ku recruits telomerase to telomeres through its interaction with Sir4 and that this recruitment pathway is counterbalanced by Rif1 and Rif2."

The telomeric silent chromatin protein Sir4 is an attractive candidate for playing this role, since it has been shown to bind Ku and because <i>sir4</i>\u0394 cells have telomeres 50\u2013150 bp shorter than wild type (<a href=\"#bib46\">Palladino et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gatbonton et al., 2006</a>), a phenotype similar to the \u223c70-bp reduction seen in <i>tlc1</i>\u0394<i>48</i> cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Peterson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Stellwagen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zappulla et al., 2011</a>). As a first test of the hypothesis that <i>SIR4</i> is involved in Ku's function as a telomerase subunit, we accurately measured the length of telomeres in <i>sir4</i>\u0394 cells and <i>tlc1</i>\u0394<i>48</i> cells, as well as <i>sir4</i>\u0394 <i>tlc1</i>\u0394<i>48</i> double mutants. We found that telomeres in <i>tlc1</i>\u0394<i>48</i> cells were 85 \u00b1 23 bp shorter than wild type, while those in <i>sir4</i>\u0394 cells were 53 \u00b1 13 bp shorter than wild type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). When these two mutations were combined to make a double-mutant strain, telomeres were 71 \u00b1 26 bp shorter than wild type, a telomere length defect very similar to that of the <i>tlc1</i>\u0394<i>48</i> single-mutant (p = 0.31). This genetic epistasis suggests that <i>SIR4</i> promotes telomere lengthening in the same pathway as TLC1-bound Ku."

Similar to what has been reported previously, we observed that <i>yku80</i>\u0394 cells supported telomeres 220 \u00b1 14 bp shorter than wild type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gravel et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Askree et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gatbonton et al., 2006</a>). However, while deleting <i>SIR4</i> resulted in a \u223c70-bp telomere-length defect in a wild-type background, it appeared to have little effect on telomere length in a <i>yku80</i>\u0394 background; telomeres in <i>sir4</i>\u0394 <i>yku80</i>\u0394 cells were 193 \u00b1 19 bp shorter than wild type. None of the strains in these experiments senesced (data not shown), and telomeres have been reported to shorten by as much as \u223c260 bp in other mutants without causing senescence (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lebo and Zappulla, 2012</a>). Thus, the lack of further telomere shortening in the <i>sir4</i>\u0394 <i>yku80</i>\u0394 double-mutant strain relative to <i>yku80</i>\u0394 is not explained by telomeres already being the shortest-possible length supporting cell growth.

Furthermore, we have generated a telomerase RNA, TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub>, that contains extra Ku-binding hairpins inserted at positions 446 and 1029. This TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub> telomerase RNA accumulates to essentially the same level (93 \u00b1 9%) as wild-type TLC1 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). If <i>SIR4</i> is required for Ku's function in maintaining telomere length as a telomerase subunit, deleting <i>SIR4</i> should prevent TLC1 alleles with extra Ku-binding hairpins from causing telomere hyper-lengthening. We passaged <i>TLC1(Ku)</i><sub><i>3</i></sub> cells in liquid culture and assessed telomere length over time. TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub> caused progressive telomere hyper-lengthening over the course of passaging in addition to some telomere shortening (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), similar to TLC1 RNAs with two Ku-binding sites (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zappulla et al., 2011</a>). We also probed the Southern blot from <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> for Y\u02b9 telomeric restriction fragments and determined that telomeres in <i>TLC1(Ku)</i><sub><i>3</i></sub> cells range from \u223c70 bp shorter than wild type to \u223c1000 bp longer after 220 generations, continuing to progressively elongate at a rate of \u223c5 bp/generation (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This increasingly heterogeneous distribution of telomere lengths in <i>TLC1(Ku)</i><sub><i>3</i></sub> cells could be due to diverse telomere lengths in the population of cells or an abnormality of telomeric DNA structure affecting how it migrates on gels (e.g., extremely long single-stranded tails). To differentiate between these possibilities, we plated the liquid culture-passaged cells for single colonies and found that telomeres from these clonal isolates were subsets of the heterogeneous liquid-cultured population (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), a behavior of telomeres that has been reported previously (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shampay and Blackburn, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Levy and Blackburn, 2004</a>). These results show that the wide variety in the relative mobility of telomeric restriction fragments in the gel is due to a broad distribution of telomere lengths from the population of cells."

The average telomeres supported by TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub> in a <i>sir4</i>\u0394 strain were 148 \u00b1 36 bp shorter than those in wild-type <i>TLC1 SIR4</i> cells (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This inability of TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub> to cause telomere hyper-lengthening without <i>SIR4</i> provides further evidence that Sir4 is required for telomerase RNA-bound Ku to promote telomere lengthening in yeast. We also tested whether the other two members of the Sir2/3/4 complex, Sir2 and Sir3, were required for Ku-mediated telomere lengthening. We observed similar results in <i>sir2</i>\u0394 and <i>sir3</i>\u0394 cells, which, like <i>sir4</i>\u0394 cells, completely lack telomeric silencing, although telomeres supported by TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub> in these backgrounds were not quite as short as those supported by TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub> in a <i>sir4</i>\u0394 background (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

To test if the telomere-length phenotypes we observed are a function of RNA abundance, we assessed telomerase RNA levels by Northern blotting. We found that deleting the 48-nt Ku-binding site in TLC1 (tlc1\u039448) reduced RNA abundance to 61 \u00b1 22% the level of wild type, similar to what has been reported (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zappulla et al., 2011</a>). In contrast to TLC1, RNAs with two Ku-binding sites, which exhibit a \u223c20% increase in telomerase RNA abundance (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zappulla et al., 2011</a>), TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub> showed little change relative to wild type (93 \u00b1 9%).

Notably, we found that tlc1\u039448 caused telomeres to shorten by \u223c500 bp in <i>rif1</i>\u0394 and <i>rif2</i>\u0394 cells. This is a substantially greater effect than the \u223c70-bp decrease caused by tlc1\u039448 in a wild-type background, and it suggests that Rif1 and Rif2 inhibit Ku-mediated telomere lengthening. When we introduced TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub> into <i>rif1</i>\u2206 or <i>rif2</i>\u2206 cells, some telomeres became further hyper-elongated and others became shorter, suggesting that TLC1-bound Ku does not require Rif1 or Rif2 to promote telomere lengthening, in contrast to the requirement we identified for Sir4 as well as Sir2 and Sir3 shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>."

Using yeast two-hybrid, the N-terminus and C-terminus of Sir4 have been shown to interact with Yku80 and Yku70, respectively, and two different regions of Yku80 have been shown to be important for binding Sir4 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tsukamoto et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Roy et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ribes-Zamora et al., 2007</a>). However, these studies do not rule out the possibility that Ku and Sir4 could be interacting indirectly, bridged by another yeast protein. Using purified yeast Ku heterodimer provided by the Cech lab (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pfingsten et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dalby et al., 2013</a>), we tested for the Ku-Sir4 interaction in vitro. [<sup>35</sup>S]-Sir4 was synthesized by using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system (RRL) spiked with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine. Prior to Sir4 protein synthesis, purified Ku heterodimer (Yku80-Myc\u2022Yku70) was also added to the lysate. After Sir4 protein synthesis, Ku was then immunoprecipitated by anti-myc affinity pull-down. The input, unbound supernatant, and bound fraction were resolved on a gel and subjected to autoradiography. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, when Ku heterodimer was omitted from this procedure, a trace amount of radioactive Sir4 was recovered in the bound fraction, indicating a small amount of non-specific Sir4 binding the beads, and when Sir4 template DNA was omitted, no bands were detected. However, when both Ku and Sir4 template DNA were present in the RRL, \u223cfivefold more radioactive Sir4 was recovered in the bound fraction than in the no-Ku control, providing evidence for a direct interaction between the Ku heterodimer and Sir4. To test if this protein\u2013protein interaction was specific, we repeated this experiment with Ku heterodimer that had been boiled before being added to the RRL. In this condition, only trace amounts of Sir4 were recovered in the bound fraction, similar to what was observed when Ku was omitted altogether. These results indicate that Sir4 participates in a specific protein\u2013protein interaction with the Ku heterodimer, as has been suggested by previous in vivo experiments."

The simplest explanation is that Sir2 and Sir3 affect Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment indirectly through altering Sir4 association with telomeres, particularly since the amount of telomere-bound Sir4 has been shown to decrease greatly, but not completely, in the absence of Sir2 or Sir3 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hoppe et al., 2002</a>). We have also shown that the proteins Rif1 and Rif2 function to inhibit Ku-mediated telomere lengthening. Because Rif1 and Rif2 compete with Sir3 and Sir4 for binding to Rap1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Moretti et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wotton and Shore, 1997</a>), this inhibition of Ku-mediated telomere lengthening could be explained by there being more Sir4 bound to telomeres in the absence of Rif1 or Rif2. To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP on myc-tagged Sir4 in <i>rif1</i>\u0394 and <i>rif2</i>\u0394 cells as well as in <i>sir2</i>\u0394 and <i>sir3</i>\u0394 cells and used real-time quantitative PCR to measure fold telomeric enrichment.

Considering these impediments, it becomes clearer why telomerase would have multiple recruitment pathways assisting in providing enzyme access to telomeres. Furthermore, carefully regulating telomerase activity is critical \u2013 it is upregulated in 90% of cancers (<a href=\"#bib58\">Shay and Bacchetti, 1997</a>) and reduced in telomere syndromes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</a>)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and multiple pathways provide opportunities for layers of regulatory control. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the primary telomerase recruitment pathway is essential and requires the Est1 telomerase subunit binding to the telomere-specific DNA-binding protein Cdc13 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Evans and Lundblad, 1999</a>).

Second, we show that telomere hyper-elongation caused by a TLC1 RNA containing three Ku-binding sites, TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub>, is dependent on <i>SIR4</i>. Third, using ChIP, we report that deleting <i>SIR4</i> causes low levels of telomerase catalytic subunit at telomeres and that this low degree of recruitment is indistinguishable from what is observed in <i>tlc1</i>\u0394<i>48</i> cells. Furthermore, TLC1 with two extra Ku-binding sites causes a 10-fold increase in TERT enrichment at telomeres, and this increase in telomerase recruitment requires <i>SIR4</i>. Finally, tethering Sir4 directly to a TLC1 RNA lacking its Ku-binding site restores telomeres to wild-type length, whereas tethering Sir3 to Ku-binding-defective TLC1 RNA does not. The fact that the loss of the telomere length-promoting function of the Ku-binding site in TLC1 can be rescued by directly tethering Sir4 to TLC1 provides strong evidence that Sir4 protein directly participates in Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment and telomere extension."

Since Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment occurs via Sir4 associating with telomeric DNA-bound Rap1, regulation of Sir4 association with Rap1, in turn, can control the ability of the Ku-Sir4 recruitment pathway to assist in telomere lengthening. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, Sir4 association with telomeres is increased in the absence of Rif1 or Rif2, suggesting that Rif1 and Rif2 inhibit Sir4 binding to telomeres. The Rif1 and Rif2 proteins have been proposed to represent a \u2018counting mechanism\u2019 for telomere-length homeostasis in which decreased binding of the Rif proteins \u2013 negative regulators of telomerase \u2013 leads to increased telomerase recruitment at short telomeres (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marcand et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Levy and Blackburn, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Teixeira et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bianchi and Shore, 2007</a>). Our model provides a parsimonious explanation for one way in which Rif1 and Rif2 regulate telomere length; that is, as competitive inhibitors of Sir4 binding to Rap1, and therefore, the Sir4-Ku telomerase recruitment pathway. The model that the Ku-Sir4 recruitment pathway is subject to Rif protein-mediated negative regulation is supported by our findings and reports in the literature. First, we showed that TLC1(Ku)<sub>3</sub>, a telomerase RNA with three Ku-binding sites, causes many telomeres to become hyper-elongated, which is similar to telomere hyper-elongation exhibited by <i>rif1</i>\u0394 and <i>rif2</i>\u0394 mutants. Second, deleting the Ku-binding site in TLC1 greatly reduces the telomere hyper-lengthening observed in <i>rif1</i>\u0394 and <i>rif2</i>\u0394 cells (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Similarly, it has been shown that the hyper-lengthening of telomeres in <i>rif2</i>\u0394 as well as <i>rif1</i>\u0394 <i>rif2</i>\u0394 mutants is greatly reduced when combined with a <i>yku70</i>\u0394 mutation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mishra and Shore, 1999</a>). Regulation of the Ku-Sir4 pathway by Rif1 and Rif2 likely modulates, in turn, the essential Est1-Cdc13 telomerase-recruitment pathway. Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment has been proposed to promote function of the Est1-Cdc13 pathway by increasing Est1 association with telomeres (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fisher et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Williams et al., 2014</a>), a mechanism that is complementary to our model for Ku-mediated telomerase recruitment."

We propose here that Ku recruits telomerase to telomeres by binding Sir4. Since it has been shown that Rif1 and Rif2 compete with Sir4 and Sir3 for binding telomere-bound Rap1, the Ku-Sir4 telomerase recruitment pathway is inhibited by Rif1 and 2, providing a simple mechanistic explanation for one way in which Rif proteins function to inhibit telomerase action at telomeres. (<b>A</b>) Ku recruitment of telomerase via Sir4 is inhibited by Rif1/2 competition for Rap1 binding with Sir4. In situations where Ku-Sir4-mediated telomerase recruitment does not occur, Est1-Cdc13-mediated telomerase recruitment can still happen, although with low efficiently. (<b>B</b>) When telomerase is recruited to a telomere through the Ku-Sir4 pathway, subsequent Est1-Cdc13-mediated recruitment to the end of the telomere becomes more efficient, resulting in increased telomerase extension of telomeres. The counterbalancing of Ku-Sir4 telomerase recruitment and Rif1/Rif2 occlusion of Sir4 binding to Rap1 may represent a system for maintaining telomere-length homeostasis in yeast."

                        "text": "Sir4-mediated telomerase recruitment via Ku suggests that there is a relationship between (semi-stable) telomeric silencing and telomerase recruitment. Such a relationship has already been suggested by the fact that Rif1 and Rif2 proteins compete with silencing proteins Sir3 and Sir4 for association with telomere-bound Rap1 and inhibit telomerase acting at longer telomeres. Accordingly, we propose that the Ku-Sir4 recruitment pathway tends to occur at shorter telomeres and is part of the negative-feedback loop regulating telomere length homeostasis. This is supported by telomerase preferentially acting at shortened telomeres (<a href=\"#bib62\">Teixeira et al., 2004</a>), which tend to have weaker silencing than longer telomeres and have fewer Rif proteins (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kyrion et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Park and Lustig, 2000</a>). Our results and previous studies show that when telomeric transcriptional silencing is absent due to <i>sir2</i>\u2206 or <i>sir3</i>\u2206 mutation, a reduced but detectable amount of Sir4 is found at telomeres by ChIP (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hoppe et al., 2002</a>). Thus, in wild-type cells, it may be that Sir4 binds to Rap1 to recruit telomerase via its Ku subunit without having established telomeric silent chromatin at the end. In summary, it seems most likely that short, non-silenced chromosome ends are the ones targeted for extension by the Sir4-Ku telomerase recruitment pathway and that this is an important part of the negative-feedback loop that maintains telomere-length homeostasis."

Disrupting the Ku-Sir4 pathway results in short but stable telomeres, whereas, in contrast, loss of Est1-Cdc13 recruitment causes complete loss of telomeres and cellular senescence. The typically smaller magnitude of the effects of the Ku-Sir4 pathway makes its disruption more likely to have been missed in prior studies. Furthermore, it has been difficult to separate the roles of Sir proteins in telomerase recruitment from competing negative roles of Rif1 and Rif2. The C-terminal domain of the Rap1 protein that binds telomeric dsDNA repeats is bound by Rif1 and Rif2 and recruits Sir3 and Sir4 to telomeres. Deleting the C-terminal domain of Rap1 therefore not only disrupts Sir-dependent silencing at telomeres but also abolishes Rif-protein inhibition of telomerase, and consequently, the net result is that telomeres become extremely long in a mutant lacking the Rap1 C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kyrion et al., 1992</a>). However, our model cannot fully explain the long-telomere phenotype of this mutant. In the absence of Rif1 and Rif2 binding at telomeres in <i>rap1</i>\u2206<i>c</i> cells, telomeres will only become hyper-elongated if a process that the Rif proteins inhibit persists. Because mutants lacking the Rap1 C-terminus have long telomeres despite having lost Sir4 binding at telomeres (at least via Rap1), the Ku-Sir4-mediated recruitment pathway we propose is not the only one inhibited by Rif1 and Rif2."

Lastly, Rap1 binding near a telomeric seed sequence has been shown to promote telomerase-dependent de novo telomere formation, although this activity was reportedly <i>SIR4</i>-independent (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ray and Runge, 1998</a>)."

Thus, this pathway represents an important mechanism by which telomerase is regulated to maintain telomere length in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and it may be generally conserved in many other species. For instance, both telomeric silent chromatin and the Ku-telomerase RNA interaction are present in humans (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baur et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ting et al., 2005</a>). Although humans lack an obvious Sir4 homolog, the protein HP1\u03b1 has been implicated in human telomeric silencing (<a href=\"#bib26\">Koering et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arnoult et al., 2012</a>) and has been shown to bind Ku70 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Song et al., 2001</a>), so it will be interesting to learn if these interactions also comprise a telomerase-recruitment pathway."

In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, cells were streaked once to solid minimal medium lacking tryptophan before being grown for ChIP.

For <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>, cells were passaged differently. First, after the streak used to shuffle-out the cover plasmid, cells were re-streaked once to solid minimal medium lacking tryptophan. Colonies from this minus-tryptophan (\u2212TRP) plate were then used to inoculate 20-ml \u2212TRP liquid cultures and culturing was performed at 30\u00b0C for \u223c24 hr.

Cultures reached the same approximate density each day as measured spectrophotometrically (600-nm light). In these experiments, generation time was approximated as 50 generations (25 generations for the colony forming after streaking to solid medium when shuffling out the cover plasmid plus 25 more for the \u2212TRP medium growth) plus 10 generations for each day of passaging in liquid cultures.

Previous work had implicated the yeast Ku heterodimer (yKu) in telomerase recruitment through a well-characterized interaction with the telomerase RNA template (TLC1). Thus, yKu bound to telomeric DNA was thought to directly recruit telomerase. However, a more recent study from the Cech lab showed that yKu could not simultaneously bind DNA and RNA in vitro, putting this simple model into question. Hass and Zappulla present a convincing case, based on genetic, biochemical and ChIP data that telomere-bound Sir4 protein instead binds to yKu, which in turn recruits telomerase through the previously described yKu-TLC1 interaction. Although this pathway does not substitute for the essential and more thoroughly studied Cdc13-Est1 telomerase recruitment pathway, the authors argue that this additional pathway may improve the robustness of the system for telomerase extension and provide additional means for its regulation."

The reduced Sir4 occupancy of telomeres in <i>sir3</i>\u2206 and <i>sir2</i>\u2206 strains could simply be mechanistically explained by the fact that Sir2/3/4 form a heterotrimeric complex and when one of the factors is absent, the trimer cannot form appropriately and this reduces the formation of higher-order complexes that normally enhance Sir4 recruitment (in addition to being a trimer, Sir3 can bind itself and Sir4, Sir4 can bind itself and Sir3, and Sir2 binds Sir4). It is possible that Sir4 molecules that are part of a higher-order Sir2/3/4 multimeric complex (i.e., Sir4 not directly bound to Rap1) can assist in telomerase recruitment and/or it could be that Sir4 bound to Rap1 is available for the Ku interaction and that the absence of Sir2 or Sir3 actually affects telomere-association of the complex due to altering Sir4\u2019s ability to associate with Rap1 as effectively as in wild-type cells."

Presumably the same Ku-Sir4 interaction interface is used for both functions and since Ku\u2019s central role in recruitment of Sir2/3/4 to telomeres is \u201cupstream\u201d of its other role in recruiting telomerase as a subunit of the RNP to telomere-associated Sir4.
