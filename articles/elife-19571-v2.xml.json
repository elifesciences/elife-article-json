We present the first global suitability model of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 and demonstrate that reliable predictions can be obtained at global scale. Best predictions are obtained using spatial predictor variables describing host distributions, rather than land use or eco-climatic spatial predictor variables, with a strong association with domestic duck and extensively raised chicken densities. Our results also support a more systematic use of spatial cross-validation in large-scale disease suitability modelling compared to standard random cross-validation that can lead to unreliable measure of extrapolation accuracy. A global suitability model of the H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses, a group of viruses that recently spread extensively in Asia and the US, shows in comparison a lower spatial extrapolation capacity than the HPAI H5N1 models, with a stronger association with intensively raised chicken densities and anthropogenic factors."

We present the first global suitability model of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 and demonstrate that reliable predictions can be obtained at global scale. Best predictions are obtained using spatial predictor variables describing host distributions, rather than land use or eco-climatic spatial predictor variables, with a strong association with domestic duck and extensively raised chicken densities. Our results also support a more systematic use of spatial cross-validation in large-scale disease suitability modelling compared to standard random cross-validation that can lead to unreliable measure of extrapolation accuracy. A global suitability model of the H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses, a group of viruses that recently spread extensively in Asia and the US, shows in comparison a lower spatial extrapolation capacity than the HPAI H5N1 models, with a stronger association with intensively raised chicken densities and anthropogenic factors."

Initially, restricted to Southern China, the virus started spreading in 2003 and by 2008, it had spread to more than 60 countries (<a href=\"#bib15\">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2016</a>), persisting now in only a few. Transmission of infection from birds to humans was also reported, causing disease in 850 confirmed human cases including 449 deaths, as of May 2016, making this virus a continuing source of human health concerns (<a href=\"#bib56\">WHO/GIP, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lai et al., 2016</a>). Re-assortment with other influenza viruses led to the replacement of most internal viral genes of the original H5N1 virus. However, the haemagglutinin (HA) gene H5 has remained present in all isolates and was therefore used to develop a standardised \u2018clade\u2019 nomenclature, first adopted in 2008, based on the evolution and divergence of H5N1 viruses that evolved from the original HA gene of the 1996 H5N1 virus (<a href=\"#bib57\">WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Evolution Working Group, 2008</a>). In the initial years from 1996 to 2008, 10 distinct clades (0\u20139) had been generated and by 2012, 11 distinct actively circulating clades had been identified (<a href=\"#bib60\">World Health Organization/World Organisation for Animal Health/Food and Agriculture Organization (WHO/OIE/FAO) H5N1 Evolution Working Group, 2014</a>)."

Continuous live-poultry market surveillance in China identified novel clade 2.3.4 reassortant viruses of different H5N2, H5N5 and H5N8 subtypes, alongside H5N1 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhao et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">2013</a>). All these viruses were part of an H5 monophyletic group of viruses that shared the H5 gene of an H5N1 clade 2.3.4 variant with neuraminidase (NA) genes from different viruses (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gu et al., 2013</a>). Consequently, the nomenclature of H5Nx viruses that clustered in this divergent HA group was updated as a new clade 2.3.4.4, in addition to two other new clades (<a href=\"#bib49\">Smith\u00a0and\u00a0Donis, 2015</a>). From January 2014 onward, viruses of clade 2.3.4.4 started spreading internationally. The first H5N8 HPAI virus outbreaks outside of China were reported in South Korea and Japan in spring 2014 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hill et al., 2015</a>). In May 2014, a novel H5N6 clade 2.3.4.4 reassortant caused outbreaks in China and Lao PDR (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wong et al., 2015</a>) and thereafter from Viet Nam and Myanmar. In November 2014, H5N8 HPAI viruses were reported from Germany, Netherlands, UK, Italy and the Russian Federation in rapid succession. In the same autumn and winter 2014/2015, H5N2 HPAI were reported from outbreaks in British Colombia, Canada. This virus contained genes similar to those of the Eurasian clade 2.3.4.4 alongside genes from North American wild bird lineages (<a href=\"#bib61\">World Organisation for Animal Health, 2016</a> ). In Taiwan, novel (H5N2, H5N3) reassortants also caused several outbreaks in 2014 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2016</a>). In December 2014, the new H5N8 and H5N2 HPAI viruses were detected in wild birds in Washington USA, before being found in poultry. By February 2015, the H5N2 HPAI virus had triggered a true epidemic in commercial poultry in the US, with nearly 43 million chickens and 7 million turkeys killed or culled across more than 20 different states (<a href=\"#bib42\">Poultry Science Association, 2016</a>). All these HPAI H5N1, H5N2, H5N6 and H5N8 viruses found in Eurasia and North America shared an H5 gene segment belonging to clade 2.3.4.4 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Claes et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2016</a>)."

From 2003 to 2010, the H5 HPAI viruses responsible for international spread and most outbreaks in poultry were of the N1 type, with continuous evolution of the H genes into different sub-lineages and gradual changes in its internal genes yielding clades and sub clades. From 2010 onward, H5Nx clade 2.3.4 viruses reassorted with several other avian influenza viruses leading to generation of a diversity of H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses bearing NA other than N1 in Asia. These novel reassortant viruses then began spreading internationally in 2013, in some cases further reassorting with viruses from other geographic lineages to yield new viruses, all bearing an H5 clade 2.3.4.4 haemagglutinin."

Spatial risk factors associated with H5N1 HPAI presence through different studies were reviewed in 2012 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gilbert and Pfeiffer, 2012</a>) and the study highlighted domestic duck density, indices of water presence (distance to rivers and proportion of land occupied by water) and anthropogenic variables (human population density and distance to roads) to be the most consistent risk factors across studies, countries and scales. However, studies comparing different sets of factors were never carried out at a global scale, and none made a distinction between clades and sub-lineages."

Machine learning techniques have become very powerful in reproducing observed distribution patterns with sets of predictor variables, but their skill in spatial extrapolation is rarely quantified and could help better discriminate among sets of important predictor variables. In addition, the very fast recent spread of clade 2.3.4.4 H5Nx viruses (H5N1, H5N2, H5N6 and H5N8), associated with multiple reassortments was unprecedented (<a href=\"#bib7\">De Vries et al., 2015</a>) and warranted further examination. A separate analysis of how 2.3.4.4 H5Nx viruses had spread in the geographical and environmental space was hence carried out in comparison to the HPAI H5N1 viruses."

The predictor variables were categorised into four sets (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) of variables. The Set 1 variables included the host variables of extensive and intensive chicken densities, human population density, and a variable to account for the effect of mass vaccination of poultry in China (IsChina).

Finally, Set 4 variables included Set 1 variables in addition to selected variables from the earlier sets that were selected on the basis of prior epidemiological knowledge. The models were subjected to three different types of cross validations to measure their goodness-of-fit (GOF) and transferability: (i) standard cross-validation (CV) with a random and stratified divide between training and validation sets, (ii) a calibrated cross-validation to account for the spatial sorting bias (SSB) <i>sensu</i> <a href=\"#bib26\">Hijmans (2012)</a> i.e. the tendency to have distance between training-presence and testing-presence sites to be smaller than the distance between training-presence and testing-absence sites, and (iii) a spatial cross-validation (Spatial CV) to spatially separate the training and validation sets by large distances and measure the spatial extrapolation capacity of the models."

The main difference between the partial dependence plots of the different variables was for the density of extensively raised chickens, which showed a positive association with H5N1 HPAI presence contrasting with an absence of association with the H5Nx HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 presence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Other profiles were somewhat comparable for the two groups of viruses and showed a positive association between virus presence and duck density, intensively raised chicken density, human population density, a negative association with the IsChina variable (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and an optimum for percentage of cropland and temperature (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It should be kept in mind that their relative contributions, i.e. their weight in the final prediction strongly differed between the two groups of viruses. It is noteworthy that the models outlined above were built using optimal number of trees estimated through spatial CV instead of standard CV, and this resulted in much lower optimal number of trees compared to standard CV models (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that standard CV may be over fitting local clusters of presence points rather than making reliable large-distance predictions. The suitability maps of the models are presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. To interpret the extrapolation capacity of these suitability maps, multivariate environmental similarity surfaces (MESS)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Elith et al., 2010</a>) were computed (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) giving information on where the models extrapolate within the range of predictor variables in the occurrence points. As observed, both models extrapolate prediction in areas with similar environmental conditions, as depicted by positive MESS values. However, the geographical space with high similarity to the occurrence point is comparatively wider for the HPAI H5N1 model, than for the H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 models."

Interestingly, H5N1 HPAI outbreaks appeared to be best modelled by predictor variables relating to host distribution. Alternative models based on land use or eco-climatic variables showed marginally better accuracy metrics when evaluated with standard CV, but significantly lower extrapolation capacity than the host-only variable. Even the models combining host variables with other environmental predictors did not produce significantly better results when evaluated through spatial CV. This observation matches earlier observations that association with eco-climatic variables were not consistently reproducible across countries and studies (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gilbert and Pfeiffer, 2012</a>) and that H5N1 HPAI is probably not as strongly environmentally constrained as other authors have suggested (<a href=\"#bib58\">Williams and Peterson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). This strongly contrasts with vector-borne diseases, where clear eco-climatic boundaries of vectors can be mapped, and where climate has a strong influence on vector seasonality and population dynamics (<a href=\"#bib36\">McMichael and Lindgren, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Morin and Comrie, 2013</a>). In the case of a directly contagious disease such as avian influenza, successful transmission and clinical outbreaks have been observed over a wide range of temperature and humidity conditions (e.g. Russia, Nigeria, Egypt, Northern China, Indonesia). Our results suggest that the main large-scale constrains to suitability for H5N1 HPAI occurrence are related to the distribution of hosts; densities of chickens and ducks raised in different systems, and to the density of the human population, probably as a surrogate measure for various anthropogenic transmission mechanisms. For the new H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 viruses, we found a somewhat different result, with a clear improvement of the extrapolation capacity of models using a set of variables combining host distribution and environmental variables. However, these models were of relatively low overall predictive power, most likely because the virus has not yet had a chance to extend fully to its potential range of occurrence as compared to H5N1 HPAI, and false pseudo-absences may have had a strong impact on the construction of models and, therefore, on the accuracy of predictions. For this model, and given its low extrapolation capacity, we emphasise that predictions made at long distances from points of presence should be interpreted with caution, as there may still be large areas where it could potentially become established and where the our model predictions may be inaccurate."

                        "text": "A second important result of this study is to demonstrate the importance of spatial CV in building and validating avian influenza suitability models over large geographical extents. The difference between standard and spatial CV evaluation of GOF was already quite significant for the HPAI H5N1 models. The difference was even more striking for the H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 models, which all appeared very good when evaluated through standard CV. However, they had poor extrapolation accuracy, sometimes even not much better than a null model when evaluated through spatial CV. Machine-learning techniques used in species distribution modelling have become incredibly powerful at reproducing a pattern from a given set of occurrence data and this is essentially what standard CV measures. However, as our results demonstrate, default cross-validation technique is a very misleading measure of their geographical extrapolation capacity. Spatial CV was found not only to\u00a0be\u00a0important for evaluating the extrapolation capacity of a given model, but also to be the only way to truly discriminate our model outputs based on different sets of predictor variables. The focus on extrapolation capacity for selecting predictor variables is driven by the assumption that a model that includes statistical relationships linked to causal mechanisms should spatially extrapolate well, as the cause-consequence statistical associations have a greater chance to apply well in different places than those that are coincidental. Of course, cause-consequence relationships may vary in space too, but the underlying assumption of suitability modelling extrapolation is that these remain constant over the spatial domain within which the model is applied. So, models based on coincidental statistical associations are expected to extrapolate poorly in the geographical domain, and these losses of predictability can hardly be quantified through standard CV because of spatial correlations between training and validation sets."

Domestic duck density was the most important variable for both models, though with a lower RC for the H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 model in Set 4. Ducks have always been strongly associated with areas of persistence and evolution of H5N1 HPAI (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gilbert and Pfeiffer, 2012</a>), which relates to their capacity to act as an intermediate, domestic reservoir between wild <i>Anatidae</i>, the main wild reservoir of avian influenza viruses, and domesticated poultry. Ducks have been referred to as the \u2018Trojan horses\u2019 for H5N1 HPAI H5N1 presence (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2014</a>) on account of their role in virus introduction, evolution, transmission and persistence (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hulse-Post et al., 2005</a>), which has been demonstrated in both host pathogenicity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cornelissen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Smith\u00a0and\u00a0Donis, 2015</a>) and geospatial studies (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gilbert and Pfeiffer, 2012</a>). The absence of duck density may in fact explain a lot of the difference in extrapolating capacity found between the host-model (Set 1) and the land-use and eco-climatic models (Set 2 and 3) that cannot discriminate areas with similar land-use and eco-climatic conditions, but that have very different duck densities. For example, India is predicted at relatively high suitability by the land-use model (Set 2, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) at a very low suitability by the host-based (except around Bangladesh) reflecting the near-absence of significant domestic duck densities in much of the country, in accordance with previous results (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gilbert et al., 2010</a>)."

(2015)</a> who found through phylogeographic analysis that the introduction of H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 to South Korea was associated with areas where domestic ducks and wild waterfowl intermingled. Complex reassortment of multiple subtypes may also occur in areas where domestic ducks and migratory birds have an opportunity to share food, water and habitat, creating opportunities for virus transmission between different species, co-infection of individual animals with different influenza viruses and subsequent gene reassortment (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deng et al., 2013</a>). It would be prudent for countries to put such areas under active surveillance for early detection of HPAI introductions and for monitoring of virus evolution. This would include the countries of the Americas and African continent where duck rearing is not as common as in South East Asia. It is noteworthy that one of the most severe recent H5 HPAI epidemics that started in 2015 in Dordogne region of France, a traditionally important duck rearing area with some of the highest duck densities in the country, even if the outbreaks were apparently caused by distinct H5 viruses from those circulating in Asia. So, the association found with domestic duck densities fits with existing knowledge of H5N1 spatial epidemiology and was a major predictor in both the H5N1 HPAI and H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 models."

An interesting hypothesis to explain this pattern would be a greater fitness of H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 viruses to spread through intensive chicken production and poultry trade systems (<a href=\"#bib5\">Claes et al., 2016</a>). We still lack extensive published experimental infection results of the new clade in poultry, but preliminary results are indicative of a lower pathogenicity of the H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 virus in chickens compared to H5N1 HPAI, with longer survival and shedding period (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Swayne et al., 2015</a>). A lower virulence in chicken was also found for the reassortant H5N2, H5N6 and H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses compared to previous 2.3.4 HPAI H5N1 viruses (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sun et al., 2016</a>), although they remained highly pathogenic. A lower mortality and longer period of infectivity may assist the virus in circulating longer and within intensified poultry production and trading systems, leading to increased opportunities for onward transmission. Evolution towards reduced pathogenicity would appear an asset in improving farm-to-farm transmission and long-term persistence even in the absence of domestic ducks. This could partly explain the stronger association of H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4 viruses with intensive chicken production areas in eastern Asia and in the US."

Whilst presence is derived from the two respective H5 data sets, absence data are rarely measured through active surveillance, so need to be approximated by generating pseudo-absences points. The literature yields no consensus on the correct approach to generate pseudo-absence data, so we used an evidence-based probabilistic framework for generating pseudo-absence data points incorporating the main biasing that may have affected the distribution of the presence points (<a href=\"#bib40\">Phillips et al., 2009</a>). We used the bgSample function from the 'seegSDM' package (<a href=\"https://github.com/SEEG-Oxford/seegSDM\">https://github.com/SEEG-Oxford/seegSDM</a>) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Phillips et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pigott et al., 2014</a>) to generate a pixel level spatial distribution of pseudo-absence based on the human population distribution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) to account for differences in surveillance and reporting intensity. This was based on the assumption that under-reporting would be more likely in remote areas with low population density than in highly populated, where the disposal or dead birds and carcasses would more hardly go unnoticed. In addition, the Empres-i database compiles outbreak locations data from very heterogeneous sources and in the absence of explicit GPS location data, the geo-referencing of individual cases is often through the use of place name gazetteers that will tend to force the outbreak location populated place, rather in the exact location of the farm where the disease was found, which would introduce a bias correlated with human population density. Finally, this also allowed to prevent any pseudo-absences in unpopulated regions."

The minimum distance was set to 10 km in both models, in relation to outbreak surveillance zones for HPAI in most countries. The maximum distance to the nearest positive observation could not be informed by surveillance strategies and was randomly set between 1000 and 3000 km across different bootstrapped runs of the model in order to ensure that the results were not too sensitive to a specific maximum distance. Prior to running the model, the duplicate points falling in the same pixel were summarised, in order to label each pixel as \u2018presence\u2019 or \u2018pseudo-absence\u2019. This procedure resulted in a reduced data set with 5038 and 403 presence points (pixels) for the H5N1 HPAI and H5Nx HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 models, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

In addition, the weight of each predictor variable was also evaluated individually by their relative contribution, a metric was produced that described the proportion of times a particular variable was selected by the model for splitting a decision tree, and the overall improvement it brought to the model (<a href=\"#bib16\">Friedman and Meulman, 2003</a>). In addition to the standard random cross-validation procedure of <a href=\"#bib14\">Elith et al., (2008)</a>, a calibrated cross-validation was also computed to account for the SSB (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hijmans, 2012</a>). Clustering of occurrences in species distribution models may lead to inflation of cross-validation metrics because the distance between training-presence and testing-presence sites will tend to be smaller than the distance between training-presence and testing-absence sites (referred to as SSB). To account for SSB, the testing data were sub-sampled using the distance to training data. The first step in this approach is to compute, for each testing-presence site, the distance to the nearest training-presence site. During the sub-sampling procedure, each testing-presence site is paired with the testing-absence site that has the most similar distance to its nearest training-presence site. If the difference between the two distances is more than a specified threshold (33%) the presence site is not used. This procedure ensures that clustering of presence data is accounted for and avoids the inflation of model evaluation metrics."

Disease outbreak data are typically clustered, or spatially autocorrelated, and this may bias standard cross validation (CV) procedures because the training and validation data sets are not independent from each other (<a href=\"#bib43\">Randin et al., 2006</a>). A possible consequence is that the goodness of fit metrics provided by the standard CV procedure may overestimate the real capacity of the model to make reliable predictions in areas distant from the training set. The spatial CV procedure was performed by partitioning non randomly the study area into five spatial clusters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) by first selecting five reference presence points. A minimum distance was specified between the selected points to obtain a balanced sample size between the clusters. These selected points represent the benchmarks to build the five-folds/clusters of the spatial CV models. Thereafter, the nearest benchmark presence to each observation is identified and labelled with this benchmark point. Finally, the five clusters containing presences and absences are delineated and are used as folds in the spatial cross validation procedure. In the procedure described by <a href=\"#bib14\">Elith et al. (2008)</a>, an optimal number of trees for the BRT model is found by finding the minimum deviance to the evaluation set. By replacing the standard CV by the spatial CV, we also allow the optimal number of trees to correspond to the minimum deviance in a geographically distant evaluation set. Both the BRT models were run with the following parameters; a tree complexity of 4, and the initial number of trees set at 100. For the HPAI H5N1 and clade H5Nx 2.3.4.4 model, a learning rate of 0.01 and 0.005, respectively, was used. A step size of 200 and 50 trees was used for the HPAI H5N1 and clade H5Nx 2.3.4.4 models, respectively."

Building on previous work mapping risk by country and by region, the authors sought to build parsimonious global suitability models based on host and environmental factors. In order to discriminate among models incorporating different variables the authors used boosted regression trees and identified human and animal population densities as key factors influencing risk (as supported by previous work). While the basic factors identified are perhaps not unexpected, refinement and improvement to mapping practices are needed to help support global preparedness and response."

As pointed out, the 2.3.3.4 viruses did have different neuraminidases and did transmit to North America, but there is no convincing evidence that we are aware of that supports the authors assumption that \"they may have different phenotypic characteristics leading to different transmission patterns\". There are very likely different risk factors combined in the \"other clade\" category. For example, clade 2.2 and clade 2.3.2.1 viruses spread out of Asia much like 2.3.4.4 (with obvious exception of migration to Americas) and at least appeared more associated with wild bird spread. Were any other subclade analyses done? Is there evidence, or at the least practical reason, to support clumping all other clades together?"

This was very apparent in the review by Gilbert & Pfeiffer (2012, doi 10.1016/j.sste.2012.01.002). In many separate countries and studies, the probability of presence of HPAI H5N1 at different levels was not associated with high chicken density, most likely because of many different production systems associating with different patterns of transmission. In fact, an important point of the paper is precisely that for an infectious disease like HPAI H5N1, host-related variables are much better at spatially predicting disease occurrence than eco-climatic ones. This was evidenced by the fact that models combining host variables with other environmental predictors did not produce significantly better results when evaluated through spatial CV."

In this case, we are using 17,068 records spread over three continents, at a spatial resolution of 0.083333 decimal degrees (approx. 10 km), so the influence of the spatial uncertainty of a fraction of these points should be quite negligible. For example, only 3.5% of the records of Empres-I were reported at the coarsest administrative level 1, 5.8% at administrative level 2, and the rest of the records were either at administrative level 3, or from locations of unknown quality for which little can be said about the position uncertainty. We\u2019ve looked at this more carefully for national data sets that we know better, and Thailand alone recorded over 1500 records, all linked to administrative unit level 3, which have a median size of 16 km<sup>2</sup>, i.e. far smaller than our pixels. The scaling was somewhat similar for Vietnam, with outbreaks geo-referenced at the commune level. The addition of a bootstrapping procedure accounting for spatial uncertainty would be technically feasible, but would only apply for the records with a known quality, and we feel that given the strong spatial autocorrelation between neighboring pixels in most of the predictor variables, it would add a significant burden of processing for a negligible difference."

Whilst the cross-validation may mitigate the potential clustering that primary and secondary cases have, I'm still not 100% convinced that this differing process can be adequately captured simultaneously.

Rather, the most likely cause of the difference is the near absence of domestic ducks in the country, except in the few states surrounding Bangladesh. As discussed, domestic ducks play an important role in the epidemiology of HPAI H5N1 as silent carriers. So, when the poultry variables are dropped, the land-use model cannot make the difference between cropping/agricultural areas where ducks are abundant from those where they are scarce, and it therefore predicts higher risk in India than the host-based model, with poorer general performances. The resulting risk map is in fact in fairly good accordance with an analysis published previously and looking specifically at the situation in South Asia (Gilbert et al. 2010, doi 10.1007/s10393-010-0672-8 & Dhingra et al. 2014 doi 10.1016/j.sste.2014.06.003).
