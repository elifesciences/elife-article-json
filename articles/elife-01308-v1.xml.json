In this study, we use proteomics to investigate the ECM of human mammary carcinoma xenografts and show that primary tumors of differing metastatic potential differ in ECM composition. Both tumor cells and stromal cells contribute to the tumor matrix and tumors of differing metastatic ability differ in both tumor- and stroma-derived ECM components. We define ECM signatures of poorly and highly metastatic mammary carcinomas and these signatures reveal up-regulation of signaling pathways including TGF\u03b2 and VEGF. We further demonstrate that several proteins characteristic of highly metastatic tumors (LTBP3, SNED1, EGLN1, and S100A2) play causal roles in metastasis, albeit at different steps. Finally we show that high expression of LTBP3 and SNED1 correlates with poor outcome for ER<sup>\u2212</sup>/PR<sup>\u2212</sup>breast cancer patients. This study thus identifies novel biomarkers that may serve as prognostic and diagnostic tools."

In this study, we use proteomics to investigate the ECM of human mammary carcinoma xenografts and show that primary tumors of differing metastatic potential differ in ECM composition. Both tumor cells and stromal cells contribute to the tumor matrix and tumors of differing metastatic ability differ in both tumor- and stroma-derived ECM components. We define ECM signatures of poorly and highly metastatic mammary carcinomas and these signatures reveal up-regulation of signaling pathways including TGF\u03b2 and VEGF. We further demonstrate that several proteins characteristic of highly metastatic tumors (LTBP3, SNED1, EGLN1, and S100A2) play causal roles in metastasis, albeit at different steps. Finally we show that high expression of LTBP3 and SNED1 correlates with poor outcome for ER<sup>\u2212</sup>/PR<sup>\u2212</sup>breast cancer patients. This study thus identifies novel biomarkers that may serve as prognostic and diagnostic tools."

Indeed, in order to progress, a tumor needs to be surrounded by a permissive environment and, to metastasize, tumor cells need to find or create a favorable niche (seed and soil theory) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Paget, 1889</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ribatti et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Erler and Weaver, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Comen, 2012</a>). To create such a niche, tumor cells either directly alter the microenvironment, or instruct local or recruited stromal cells to do so. In the context of breast cancer, recent studies have shown that the cross-talk and interaction of the tumor cells with their surrounding microenvironment is necessary for tumor progression (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tlsty and Coussens, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Polyak et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dvorak et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Boudreau et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Conklin and Keely, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fordyce et al., 2012</a>).

Using this approach, we characterized the extracellular matrices of normal murine tissues (e.g., lung and colon) and demonstrated that each of these comprises over 100 proteins. In this study, we apply this proteomics approach to study the composition of the ECMs of poorly and highly metastatic human mammary carcinoma xenografts, and show that both the tumor cells and the stromal cells contribute in characteristic ways to the production of the tumor ECM. Moreover, we show that both tumor- and stroma-derived proteins differ between tumors of different metastatic potential. Importantly, we demonstrate functional roles for several specific tumor-cell-derived ECM proteins in promoting metastasis. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the proteomic analysis of the tumor ECM can be used to identify proteins playing causal roles in tumor progression that could be further developed as prognostic or diagnostic markers and potentially as therapeutic targets."

Matrisome-associated proteins include ECM-affiliated proteins, ECM regulators (ECM remodeling enzymes and their regulators), and ECM-associated secreted factors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). One can note that the most abundant proteins for each of these categories were detected in both tumor types. Examples of these proteins are fibronectin (FN1), fibrinogen, laminins, HSPG2 or perlecan, collagens I, III, IV, V and VI, and transglutaminase 2 (TGM2). In fact, we have previously reported the expression of these proteins in several normal tissues (<a href=\"#bib38\">Naba et al., 2012</a>), which suggests that these proteins are widely expressed. Most of the matrisome-associated components were detected at lower abundance, reflecting their presence at lower molar ratios than structural core ECM proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Therefore, the analysis identified ECM signatures of poorly (26 proteins) or highly (43 proteins) metastatic tumors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B and 2</a>) and the proteins that differ between the two tumor types belong mostly to the ECM glycoproteins and the ECM regulators categories. Among the 43 proteins characteristic of highly metastatic tumors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), we identified several proteins that have previously been reported to play a role in breast cancer metastasis in diverse cell and tumor models. Examples of these are angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4, <a href=\"#bib40\">Padua et al., 2008</a>), cathepsin B (CTSB, <a href=\"#bib48\">Sevenich et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Vasiljeva et al., 2006</a>), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (IGFBP4, <a href=\"#bib47\">Ryan et al., 2009</a>) and lysyl-oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2, <a href=\"#bib2\">Barry-Hamilton et al., 2010</a>). Several other proteins in our list have been shown to play roles in metastasis of other tumor types (\u2018Discussion\u2019)."

Therefore we could determine the relative contributions of tumor and stromal cells to the production of the tumor ECM. We found that the tumor extracellular matrix is secreted by both tumor cells and stromal cells; some proteins are exclusively secreted by the tumor cells or the stromal cells; and some proteins are secreted by both compartments: either in equal proportions or more abundantly by the tumor cells or by the stromal cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>).

Structural collagens (collagens I and V) are also mostly secreted by the stroma. Components of the basement membranes were found to be expressed by the tumor cells only (laminin chains \u03b13, \u03b23, \u03b32), by both compartments (laminin chains \u03b15, \u03b31, COL6A3, HSPG2) or by the stroma (Nidogens 1 and 2). In addition, 36 proteins were detected in both tumor types but their origin differed as a function of the tumor\u2019s metastatic potential (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In poorly metastatic tumors, fibronectin (FN1) and periostin (POSTN) are secreted by the tumor cells, whereas in highly metastatic tumors, they are secreted by both the tumor cells and the stromal cells. Conversely, several basement membrane components (laminin chains \u03b21 and \u03b22, and the collagen chains 4A1, 4A5 6A1, 6A2 and 18A1) are secreted in poorly metastatic tumors mostly by the stroma, whereas in highly metastatic tumors, they are secreted by both the tumor cells and the stromal cells. As expected, many proteins specific to either poorly or highly metastatic tumors were secreted exclusively by the tumor cells.

Interestingly, a recent publication by Curran and Keely highlights the convergence of TGF\u03b2 and HIF1\u03b1 signaling pathways as a key contributor to the cross-talk between breast tumor cells and stromal cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Curran and Keely, 2013</a>). Altogether, this analysis indicates that by interrogating the tumor extracellular matrix, one can identify signaling pathways up-regulated within the tumor cells or stromal cells and these represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention."

We next wanted to evaluate whether other proteins found to be differentially expressed between poorly and highly metastatic tumors might play any causal, functional roles in tumor progression. Accordingly, we selected a set of proteins (LTBP3\u2014Latent TGF\u03b2 Binding Protein 3; SNED1\u2014Sushi, Nidogen and EGF-like Domains 1; EGLN1\u2014Egl Nine homolog 1 and S100A2) based on the following criteria: they were (1) detected only in highly metastatic tumors; (2) secreted exclusively by the tumor cells; (3) in relatively high abundance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>); (4) not previously investigated for any roles in metastasis. We focused on ECM proteins produced by the tumor cells as their expression can easily be manipulated in vitro. We also investigated the role of CYR61, a tumor-derived ECM protein detected in both MDA-MB-231 and LM2 tumors but with a much greater abundance in LM2 tumors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). For proteins against which antibodies were available (LTBP3, EGLN1, and CYR61) we confirmed their differential expression by immunoblot and/or immunofluorescence analyses (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). We also performed RT-qPCR analyses for several other proteins in our lists despite the fact that it is well known that mRNA levels and steady-state protein levels do not correlate at all well (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gygi et al., 1999</a>). It can be seen that the mRNA changes for several of the proteins of interest (CYR61, EGLN1, LTBP3) do not show mRNA changes corresponding with the marked differences in protein levels detected, although some do (S100A2, SNED1) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In addition, we show that Ltbp3 and Sned1 mRNAs are up-regulated during malignant progression in the autochthonous MMTV-PyMT murine mammary tumor model (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

Control or knocked-down LM2 cells were orthotopically injected into the mouse mammary fat pad. At sacrifice (7 +/\u22120.5 weeks post-injection), the masses of the primary tumors were measured. We observed that none of the genes, when knocked down, significantly affected primary tumor growth (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Consistently, we also observed no differences in tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis between control and knockdown tumors (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Importantly, the primary tumors (and the metastases deriving from them) were still ZsGreen-positive, indicating that the shRNA construct was still strongly expressed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We also confirmed that the knockdowns persisted in vivo (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and that there was no compensatory up-regulation of these genes by the stroma (data not shown).

In our system, LM2 cells are injected in the absence of exogenous ECM support (Matrigel) in immunodeficient mice (NOD/SCID/IL2R\u03b3-null). We observed that the parental LM2 cells and the LM2 cells expressing the control hairpin, in addition to metastasizing to the lung, also could colonize the liver and the spleen from the primary site (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We thus wanted to evaluate the capacity of the knockdown tumors to metastasize from the primary site (mammary gland) to distant organs. Whereas knocking down CYR61, a protein that we detected by proteomics in both poorly and highly metastatic tumors, did not affect metastasis formation, knocking down any of the four genes characteristic of highly metastatic (LM2) tumors, and not detected in the poorly metastatic (MDA-MB-231) tumors, led to a significant decrease of the metastatic burden as compared with that of mice injected with control LM2 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). None of the SNED1 or EGLN1 knockdown tumors disseminated to organs other than the lungs and the number of mice presenting visible lung metastases was dramatically decreased (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). LTBP3 and S100A2 knockdown also led to a very significant inhibition of metastatic dissemination, although we detected occasional visible metastases in the liver or spleen of mice injected with LTBP3 or S100A2 knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Because of the pulmonary tropism of LM2 cells, we further analyzed the lungs of control or knockdown tumor-bearing mice. The analysis of the lungs of control or knockdown tumor-bearing mice for the presence or absence of ZsGreen-positive metastatic foci confirmed the significant decrease in the number of metastases formed by knockdown tumors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). As the tumor cells are human, we monitored the presence of human cells within murine lungs. We used a human-specific anti-vimentin antibody and Alu PCR to detect human genomic DNA and both methods confirmed the significantly decreased metastatic burden in knockdown-tumor-bearing mice as compared to control mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). These results demonstrate that these four ECM proteins play significant functional roles in the metastatic dissemination of these mammary tumor cells."

To pinpoint which steps of the metastatic cascade are influenced by each metastasis-associated ECM protein, we first compared the vascularization, invasiveness, and degree of fibrosis in control and knockdown primary tumors. Knock-down of any of the five ECM genes selected did not affect significantly primary tumor vascularization (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Control tumors markedly invaded the skin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and the surrounding muscles (not shown), and were significantly fibrotic, as indicated by staining tumor sections with Masson\u2019s Trichrome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Cells in which CYR61, EGLN1, or S100A2 were knocked down formed highly invasive (white arrow) and desmoplastic tumors resembling the control tumors, suggesting that these proteins did not influence tumor invasion or fibrosis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Interestingly, LTBP3 and SNED1 knockdown tumors were characterized by deposition of collagen at the periphery of the tumor forming a thick capsule. Consistently, the LTBP3 and SNED1 tumors failed to invade the surrounding tissues, suggesting that LTBP3 and SNED1 are promoters of tumor invasiveness."

When injected into the blood circulation, control LM2 cells efficiently seeded and colonized the lungs and formed large metastases detectable by fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, upper panel), by staining lung sections with hematoxylin and eosin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, middle panel) or with an anti-human vimentin antibody (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, lower panel). Knockdown of EGLN1 or S100A2 strongly inhibited the formation of pulmonary metastases (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u20137C</a>). In contrast, knockdown of LTBP3 or SNED1 in LM2 cells did not affect lung colonization (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>), consistent with our finding that these proteins influence tumor cell invasion at the primary site (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Although LTBP3 knockdown gave rise to the same number of metastases, the metastases were significantly smaller (based on the size of the ZsGreen-positive foci) and consistently, the Alu PCR signal was significantly lower than in the control lungs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Together, our data suggest that, although all these four proteins are required to increase metastasis formation, they do so by influencing different steps of the metastatic cascade. LTBP3 and SNED1 likely act early in the metastatic cascade by promoting tumor invasiveness. In addition, LTBP3, but not SNED1, appears to affect the growth of lung metastases. Our data also suggest that EGLN1 and S100A2 are likely to act at later stages of the metastatic cascade (extravasation, seeding, survival, and/or growth of the tumor cells in secondary sites) because, although the primary tumors are very invasive, they failed to colonize distant organs."

Since equivalent proteomic data are not yet available for human patient material, we could only make comparisons with mRNA expression data, even though we know that correlation between protein and mRNA levels is known to be loose. We used Kaplan\u2013Meier Plotter (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gy\u00f6rffy et al., 2010</a>), an online-available meta-analysis tool for biomarker assessment. Using this tool, we tested whether the mRNA expression of any of the four genes we studied correlated with distant-metastasis-free survival for breast cancer patients. While expression levels for SNED1 and LTBP3 were not significantly correlated across all mammary cancer sub-types (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, right panels), they were significantly correlated (p values of 0.0079 and 0.034, respectively) with poor prognosis for estrogen-receptor-negative and progesterone-receptor-negative (ER<sup>\u2212</sup>/PR<sup>\u2212</sup>) patients (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, left panels). In this context, it is significant that the MDA-MB-231 cells were isolated from the pleural effusion of a triple-negative breast cancer patient (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cailleau et al., 1978</a>). While we are not suggesting that the correlations between the expression of two ECM proteins and probability of metastasis in a limited subset of cancer patients is currently of predictive value, this analysis demonstrates that we can identify within our proteomics signatures, a subset of ECM proteins that are pro-metastatic in model systems and may have potential as prognostic biomarkers and are worthy of further investigation."

We show that the tumor ECM is derived from both the tumor and stromal cells and that tumors of differing metastatic potential differ in both the tumor- and stroma-derived ECM. Our study led to the identification of tumor-derived ECM proteins that play functional roles in tumor progression and metastatic dissemination. Indeed, a high proportion of the proteins we detected as up-regulated in highly metastatic tumors (some reported previously, some new to this study) contribute to metastatic dissemination. We further demonstrate that these proteins can affect different steps of the metastatic cascade: LTBP3 and SNED1 appear to promote early stages of invasion and dissemination, whereas EGLN1 and S100A2 act at later stages of the metastatic cascade. Finally, using gene expression data sets from breast cancer patients, we show that some of the proteins discovered by proteomics as differentially expressed are correlated with breast cancer patient outcomes. We studied in detail five ECM or ECM-associated proteins not previously clearly implicated in metastasis and demonstrate that four out of five of these proteins play roles at different steps of the metastatic cascade."

The fact that we observed a decrease in the number of metastases formed by cells in which S100A2 was knockeddown, both when the cells were injected orthotopically and metastasized from the primary tumor and when the cells were injected in the circulation, suggests that S100A2 is important for the growth of tumor cells in distant organs, in particular the lungs."

Indeed, in addition to the four proteins whose involvement in mammary carcinoma metastasis we report here, previous studies using various mammary carcinoma cell lines or tumor models had already implicated several other proteins in breast cancer progression (ANGPTL4, CTSB, IGFBP4, LOXL2) or invasiveness of breast tumor cells (ADAM9, ADAM10). In addition, analyses by Kaplan\u2013Meier Plotter (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gy\u00f6rffy et al., 2010</a>) show that several proteins from our list of ECM proteins up-regulated in highly metastatic LM2 cells (ADAM9, LOXL2, S100A2; data not shown) show statistically significant correlations with poor prognosis for metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients. Thus, in total, from the list of 43 ECM proteins that we find expressed only in the metastatic LM2 cells and not in MDA-MB-231, 12 show suggestive evidence of functional involvement in metastasis of breast cancer. Also included are proteins previously implicated in tumor progression in other cancer types (e.g., CTGF, TIMP1, S100A10) and proteins that we have identified in proteomics screens of other tumor models (unpublished data). These concordances indicate that the proteins we identify here are relevant to breast cancer metastasis and their significance is likely not limited solely to the breast cancer lines we used in this study."

Two main pathways, the TGF\u03b2 pathway and the HIF1\u03b1/VEGF pathway, appeared to be upstream of several of the proteins we identified. In addition to signal transduction pathways, microRNAs are another mechanism by which cells can rapidly control the expression or inhibition of sets of genes. Korpal et al. have identified in breast cancer patients the miR-200 family as being pro-metastatic via its inhibition of Sec23a, a protein involved in the secretion machinery (<a href=\"#bib30\">Korpal et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, several of the proteins we found to be up-regulated in highly metastatic tumors (AGRN, LTBP3, EFEMP2, IGFBP4, SERPINE2, SNED1 and TINAGL1) were shown in the Korpal study to be down-regulated in the conditioned medium of Sec23a knockdown cells and were thus postulated to be anti-metastatic. However, our study indicates that this set of proteins is pro-metastatic, which could point towards tumor-specific or context-dependent mechanisms of action for these proteins."

This is consistent with the idea that the composition of the stroma (possibly including the cell types present) of a non-metastatic primary tumor differs from that of a highly metastatic primary tumor and that tumor cells of different metastatic potential may recruit different stromal cell types. In fact, we have observed that LM2 tumors are more vascularized than the MDA-MB-231 tumors (data not shown). Our data also suggest that tumor cells of different metastatic potential can instruct local stromal cells to express different sets of ECM proteins. This interesting aspect of tumor\u2013stroma interactions has not been extensively studied in vivo, although a recent paper notes that cancer-associated fibroblasts from different mammary tumor subtypes differ in their expression profiles (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tchou et al., 2012</a>)."

We showed that LTBP3 and SNED1, identified by proteomics in our study as differentially expressed between poorly and highly metastatic mammary tumors, correlate at the transcript level with clinical outcome in a cohort of ER<sup>\u2212</sup>/PR<sup>\u2212</sup> breast cancer patient. We can envision three ways in which one could exploit the ECM to improve cancer diagnosis and prognosis and improve cancer patient care. As demonstrated for SNED1 and LTBP3, other proteins that are part of the proteomic signatures of highly and poorly metastatic breast tumors described here, may prove to correlate with patient outcomes and may prove useful as novel prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers. Development of immuno- or mass spectrometry-based assays (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gillette and Carr, 2013</a>) for these proteins is therefore of interest since protein-level measurements may be of equivalent or greater predictive value than RNA expression analyses. This will require development of panels of specific antibodies against the ECM proteins of interest and their testing on larger numbers of well annotated patient samples to establish correlations with tumor stage and patient outcomes. ECM proteins are particularly favorable candidate biomarkers since they are abundant, are laid down in characteristic patterns and are readily accessible. ECM proteins can also serve as anchors to deliver selectively to tumors and/or metastases imaging probes to enhance the detection of metastases or anti-tumor agents to enhance therapy on the model of the work pioneered by Neri et al. (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pasche and Neri, 2012</a>). Finally, another possible translational aspect is the identification of potential novel direct therapeutic targets. Whether by targeting the interactions between ECM proteins and their cellular receptors (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goodman and Picard, 2012</a>) or by disrupting the architecture of the ECM (that acts as a barrier) to allow more efficient drug delivery (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yuan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Whatcott et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jacobetz et al., 2013</a>), the proteins discovered in our differential proteomics-based approach have the potential to serve as novel anticancer therapeutic targets."

MS/MS spectra were searched against a UniProt database containing both human (78,369 entries) and mouse (53,448 entries) sequences. All sequences (including isoforms and excluding fragments) were downloaded from the UniProt website on 30 June 2010. To each database a set of common laboratory contaminant proteins (73 entries) was appended. Initial search parameters included: ESI linear ion-trap scoring parameters, trypsin enzyme specificity with a maximum of two missed cleavages, 35% minimum matched peak intensity, \u00b1 20 ppm precursor mass tolerance, \u00b1 0.7 Da product mass tolerance, and carbamidomethylation of cysteines and possible carbamylation of N-termini as fixed/mix modifications. Allowed variable modifications were oxidized methionine, deamidation of asparagine, pyro-glutamic acid modification at N-terminal glutamine, and hydroxylation of proline with a precursor MH + shift range of \u221218 to 97 Da. Hydroxyproline was only observed in the proteins known to have it (collagen and proteins containing collagen domains; emilins, etc) and only within the expected GXPG sequence motifs. <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a> containing the detailed peptide spectral matches might have some examples not in the expected motif when there is either a proline near the motif for which the spectrum could have had insufficient fragmentation to confidently localize the mass change to a particular residue, or a nearby methionine in the peptide and the spectrum had insufficient fragmentation to localize the mass change to oxidized methionine or hydroxyproline. When the motif nX[ST] occurs in a peptide in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>, this is likely to indicate a site where N-linked glycosylation was removed by the PNGaseF treatment of the sample. While a lowercase n indicates a gene-encoded asparagine residue detected in aspartic acid form, possible mechanisms of modification such as acid-catalyzed deamidation during sample processing vs enzymatic conversion during deglycosylation cannot be explicitly distinguished. Identities interpreted for individual spectra were automatically designated as confidently assigned using the Spectrum Mill autovalidation module to apply target-decoy-based, false-discovery rate (FDR) scoring threshold criteria via a two-step auto-threshold strategy at the spectral and protein levels. First, peptide mode was set to allow automatic variable range precursor mass filtering with score thresholds optimized to yield a spectral level FDR of 1.6% for each of the precursor charge states 2, 3, and 4 in each LC-MS/MS run. Second, protein mode was applied to further filter all the peptide-level validated spectra combined from the 22 LC-MS/MS runs from both replicates of an experiment using a minimum protein score of 20 and a maximum protein-level FDR of zero. Since the maximum peptide score is 25, the protein-level step filters the results so that each identified protein is comprised of multiple peptides unless a single excellent scoring peptide was the sole match. The above criteria yielded false discovery rates of &lt;1.0% for each sample at the peptide\u2013spectrum match level and &lt;1.2% at the distinct peptide level as estimated by target-decoy-based searches using reversed sequences. In calculating scores at the protein level and reporting the identified proteins, redundancy is addressed in the following manner: the protein score is the sum of the scores of distinct peptides. A distinct peptide is the single highest scoring instance of a peptide detected through an MS/MS spectrum. MS/MS spectra for a particular peptide may have been recorded multiple times, (i.e., as different precursor charge states, isolated from adjacent OGE fractions, modified by deamidation at Asn or oxidation of Met) but are still counted as a single distinct peptide. When a peptide sequence &gt;8 residues long is contained in multiple protein entries in the sequence database, the proteins are grouped together and the highest scoring one and its accession number are reported. In some cases, when the protein sequences are grouped in this manner there are distinct peptides which uniquely represent a lower scoring member of the group (isoforms, family members, and different species i.e., mouse vs human). Each of these instances spawns a subgroup and multiple subgroups are reported and counted towards the total number of proteins and in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>, they are given related protein subgroup numbers (see column AQ and AR I <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1A</a>, e.g., Tenascin C (TNC), the murine and human forms and are listed as subgroup members 25.1 and 25.2 respectively). Our in silico matrisome list was then used to categorize all of the identified protein subgroups as being ECM-derived or not. The reporting of the number of peptides contributing to each subgroup can be altered by enabling the subgroup-specific option in Spectrum Mill. This was done to report separately the species-specific peptides, the peptides common to both human and mouse, and the total of common and species-specific peptides."

When we sought to determine the relative abundance of human-derived and murine-derived proteins, we used extracted ion chromatograms (XIC\u2019s) for each peptide precursor ion in the intervening high resolution FT-MS scans of the LC-MS/MS runs. An individual protein\u2019s abundance was calculated as the sum of the ion current measured for all quantifiable peptide precursor ions with MS/MS spectra confidently assigned to that protein. Peptides were considered not quantifiable if they were shared across multiple subgroups of a protein or the precursor ions had a poorly defined isotope cluster (i.e., the subgroup-specific and exclude poor isotope quality precursor XIC\u2019s filters in Spectrum Mill were enabled). Proteins were considered quantifiable if they were represented in two independent samples and represented by at least two distinct peptides in one of the two samples. The peak area for the XIC of each precursor ion subjected to MS/MS was calculated automatically by the Spectrum Mill software in the intervening high-resolution MS1 scans of the LC-MS/MS runs using narrow windows around each individual member of the isotope cluster. Peak widths in both the time and <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> domains were dynamically determined based on MS scan resolution, precursor charge and <i>m</i>/<i>z</i>, subject to quality metrics on the relative distribution of the peaks in the isotope cluster vs theoretical. Although the determined protein ratios are generally reliable to within a factor of twofold of the actual ratio, numerous experimental factors contribute to variability in the determined abundance for a protein. These factors may include incomplete digestion of the protein; widely varying response of individual peptides due to inherent variability in ionization efficiency and interference/suppression by other components eluting at the same time as the peptide of interest, differences in instrument sensitivity over the mass range analyzed, and inadequate sampling of the chromatographic peak between MS/MS scans."

Those experiments could not have been done without suitable cell lines and mouse xenograft models. A major advantage of this system is that LM2 cells metastasize from the primary tumor site (mammary gland) without requiring the addition of Matrigel (which would complicate the proteomics). LM2 also efficiently metastasize when injected via the tail vein. We find these cells, previously used in several discovery studies (at the RNA expression level) of metastasis, suitable for the protein-level studies that we conducted. We clearly demonstrate in this paper that the changes in the proteins that we tested are functionally significant in metastasis in the systems analyzed. As noted above, we are not claiming that the results obtained with this pair of cell lines are demonstrably broadly applicable. We hope they will be and we have noted the evidence consistent with that hope. We believe that to repeat the complete set of proteomics experiments and knockdowns presented in this manuscript on other tumor cell lines would not be a productive use of time, money and animals (quite apart from requiring probably at least a year of further work). If we were to do that as requested, the question would still remain \u2013 how relevant are these data to human breast cancer? It does not seem to us to be a reasonable request.

Rather, it will be necessary to prepare antibodies to the candidate ECM biomarkers discovered here and apply them in immunohistochemistry assays of human tumor microarrays to test correlations with clinical stage, tumor type, metastatic potential, etc. This is a large endeavor (few useful antibodies are available) but it is only made possible by the discoveries described in this paper \u2013 that is why we believe that this paper merits publication prior to that considerable extension to clinical material."

Our requirement of a protein being detected in two replicates and with at least two peptides in one of the two replicate is a conservative threshold that was applied to virtually eliminate the possibility of a false-positive identification. So, there is no doubt about the identity or differential expression of the proteins. Rather than using the words most and all, the reviewer\u2019s comment would seem to be more accurately stated as \u201csome of the proteins that showed differential expression and some of the ones chosen for functional studies had relatively few peptides\u201d.

We believe that we have done the best that can be done \u2013 we have applied stringent criteria for scoring the proteomics data, all of which have been replicated. We have added text to the manuscript (pages noted in the response to referees, and highlighted in the resubmitted manuscript) to clarify for the reader. These are not one-off Western blot data and they are robust."

As we have mentioned above, we did conduct RT-qPCR analyses on a variety of mammary cell lines but, as we demonstrate for the ones we have studied in detail (MDA-MB-MB231 and LM2), such data are not of much significance with respect to protein data. Furthermore, and perhaps even more important, in vitro data on other cell lines are very poorly relevant to the situation in vivo. All our data concern tumors growing in vivo and thus comprise both tumor-cell-derived proteins as well as stromal proteins and, as we show in the paper, there is extensive crosstalk between the cells \u2013 so in vitro data are not germane."

Without such prior studies, we believe, it would be pointless to proceed to do further knockdown/metastasis assays (also a lot of time, mice, and expense) on other lines not validated for in vivo expression. Quite apart from the fact that what you are requesting would be a large body of work, requiring an extended time, large numbers of mice (we estimate that we used &gt;100 mice for the experiments presented, each housed for months while tumors developed) and considerable expense both for the mice and for the proteomics, we do not believe that these are the next essential questions. If we believed that such a sequence of experiments would be productive, we would do them."

No matter how many cell lines or mouse models we examined, the question would still remain \u2013 how relevant are these xenotransplant data to human breast cancer? You and the referees have raised this point and we completely agree with it. Therefore, what we should be doing (and are) is extending the novel insights gained from this paper to human patient material. That is why we included some comparisons with patient outcome data extracted from the literature in our initial submission. We have now expanded that (and toned down some of our conclusions to \u201ccorrelation\u201d rather than \u201cprediction\u201d). These data show that many of the proteins we identify in vivo as upregulated in highly metastatic tumors show corroborative evidence \u2013 from other papers and/or from our comparisons with gene expression metadata analyses \u2013 supporting their roles in human breast cancer. Even though these are comparisons between protein level data and mRNA expression data with all their qualifications, there are a striking number of concordances that need investigation. We believe that validates our approach and the data presented in this paper \u2013 proteins we identify through in vivo analyses of our (admittedly) model discovery system include many that may be relevant to human cancer."

We see the next required steps to be to extend the work to human patient material, not to do further confirmatory experiments in xenotransplant models in mice. It has been our understanding that <i>eLife</i> also believes that excessive time should not be spent on performing experiments that do not materially improve a paper, delaying publication of the work, and postponing the progress of junior investigators onto the next substantive investigations. That is our contention here and we hope that you will consider our arguments for this position."
