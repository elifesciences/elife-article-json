Less clear is whether intergenic lncRNAs commonly regulate transcription by modulating chromatin at genomically distant loci. Here, we report both genomically local and distal RNA-dependent roles of <i>Dali</i>, a conserved central nervous system expressed intergenic lncRNA. <i>Dali</i> is transcribed downstream of the <i>Pou3f3</i> transcription factor gene and its depletion disrupts the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. Locally, <i>Dali</i> transcript regulates transcription of the <i>Pou3f3</i> locus. Distally, it preferentially targets active promoters and regulates expression of neural differentiation genes, in part through physical association with the POU3F3 protein. <i>Dali</i> interacts with the DNMT1 DNA methyltransferase in mouse and human and regulates DNA methylation status of CpG island-associated promoters in <i>trans</i>. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that a single intergenic lncRNA controls the activity and methylation of genomically distal regulatory elements to modulate large-scale transcriptional programmes."

Less clear is whether intergenic lncRNAs commonly regulate transcription by modulating chromatin at genomically distant loci. Here, we report both genomically local and distal RNA-dependent roles of <i>Dali</i>, a conserved central nervous system expressed intergenic lncRNA. <i>Dali</i> is transcribed downstream of the <i>Pou3f3</i> transcription factor gene and its depletion disrupts the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. Locally, <i>Dali</i> transcript regulates transcription of the <i>Pou3f3</i> locus. Distally, it preferentially targets active promoters and regulates expression of neural differentiation genes, in part through physical association with the POU3F3 protein. <i>Dali</i> interacts with the DNMT1 DNA methyltransferase in mouse and human and regulates DNA methylation status of CpG island-associated promoters in <i>trans</i>. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that a single intergenic lncRNA controls the activity and methylation of genomically distal regulatory elements to modulate large-scale transcriptional programmes."

Chalei et al. found that <i>Dali</i> also binds to an enzyme, called DNMT1, that chemically modifies DNA to change how it is packaged into a cell, and they predict that this enzyme helps <i>Dali</i> to find its binding sites. Furthermore, when <i>Dali</i> lncRNA levels were artificially reduced, the chemical modifications that affect the packaging of DNA in the cell\u2014and hence the expression of genes encoded by this DNA\u2014were changed for several genes.

Many of these transcripts appear to act near to their site of synthesis to regulate the expression of genes locally on the same chromosome (<i>cis</i>-acting). <i>Cis</i>-acting lncRNA regulatory mechanisms have been described in detail for a number of enhancer associated nuclear lncRNAs, as well as lncRNAs involved in the processes of genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tian et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Melo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Monnier et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mousavi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Santoro et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Vallot et al., 2013</a>).

Single exon models, in particular, can be artefacts arising from genomic DNA contaminating sequencing libraries, and transcripts that are expressed at average levels lower than one copy per cell are less likely to confer function. Highly and broadly expressed, and bona fide monoexonic intergenic lncRNAs, such as <i>Neat1</i> and <i>Malat1</i>/<i>Neat2</i>, however, appear not to have essential roles because their knockout mouse models are viable and fertile (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eissmann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). Transcript sequences and levels are thus not reliable predictors of mechanism.

To investigate the mechanistic basis of this physical linkage we chose to study a 3.5-kb, CNS-expressed, monoexonic, intergenic lncRNA termed <i>Dali</i> (DNMT1-Associated Long Intergenic), owing to its conservation of sequence and transcription across therian mammals and its genomic proximity to a transcription factor gene, <i>Pou3f3</i> (also known as <i>Brn1</i> or <i>Oct8</i>), which encodes a class III POU family transcription factor. <i>Dali</i> is transcribed in the sense orientation, relative to <i>Pou3f3</i>, from a locus 50 kb downstream of <i>Pou3f3</i> within the flank of an extended genomic region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) that is characterised by near pervasive transcription in neuronal lineages (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ramos et al., 2013</a>). Sauvageau et al. recently generated mouse knockout models for two of these intergenic lncRNA loci, <i>linc-Brn1a,</i> and <i>linc-Brn1b</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Genomic deletion of the <i>linc-Brn1b</i> locus resulted in significant (\u223c50%) down-regulation of the upstream <i>Pou3f3</i> gene, and <i>linc-Brn1b</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice exhibited abnormalities of cortical lamination and barrel cortex organization (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sauvageau et al., 2013</a>). These abnormalities may derive from loss of the <i>linc-Brn1b</i> RNA transcript, or from the deletion of DNA functional elements (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bassett et al., 2014</a>).

To investigate this, we performed Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Xiong and Laird, 1997</a>) in parallel at 10 different CpG islands. Selection of these regions was on the basis that they each contained several COBRA-compatible restriction enzyme sites and could be efficiently amplified from bisulfite-converted template.

In this model, <i>Pou3f3</i>-dependent target genes are regulated by <i>Dali</i> both indirectly, via its transcriptional regulatory effect on the <i>Pou3f3</i> gene, and directly via its physical interaction with the POU3F3 protein and their co-occupancy at regulatory regions of target genes."

It is thus possible that <i>Dali</i> competes for binding to DNMT1 with either protein co-factors such as UHRF1, which loads and orients the enzyme on the DNA substrate (<a href=\"#bib16\">Inomata et al., 2008</a>), or its DNA substrate. Targeting of DNMT1 to specific loci is believed to be mediated by DNMT1-interacting transcription factors. 58 transcriptional factors have been reported as DNMT1 interactors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hervouet et al., 2010</a>), of which 9 have enriched sequence motifs in <i>Dali</i> CHART-Seq peaks. We thus propose a model in which such transcription factors promote the sequence-specificity of <i>Dali</i>-modulated DNA methylation changes.

Thus, this manuscript is both timely and important.
