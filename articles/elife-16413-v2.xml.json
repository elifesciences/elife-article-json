We have identified a virus-encoded protein termed gp37/Dip, which directly binds and inhibits the RNA degradation machinery of its bacterial host. Encoded by giant phage \u0444KZ, this protein associates with two RNA binding sites of the RNase E component of the <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> RNA degradosome, occluding them from substrates and resulting in effective inhibition of RNA degradation and processing. The 2.2 \u00c5 crystal structure reveals that this novel homo-dimeric protein has no identifiable structural homologues. Our biochemical data indicate that acidic patches on the convex outer surface bind RNase E. Through the activity of Dip, \u0444KZ has evolved a unique mechanism to down regulate a key metabolic process of its host to allow accumulation of viral RNA in infected cells."

We have identified a virus-encoded protein termed gp37/Dip, which directly binds and inhibits the RNA degradation machinery of its bacterial host. Encoded by giant phage \u0444KZ, this protein associates with two RNA binding sites of the RNase E component of the <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> RNA degradosome, occluding them from substrates and resulting in effective inhibition of RNA degradation and processing. The 2.2 \u00c5 crystal structure reveals that this novel homo-dimeric protein has no identifiable structural homologues. Our biochemical data indicate that acidic patches on the convex outer surface bind RNase E. Through the activity of Dip, \u0444KZ has evolved a unique mechanism to down regulate a key metabolic process of its host to allow accumulation of viral RNA in infected cells."

In the paradigm <i>Escherichia coli</i> RNA degradosome, this complex is built around the hydrolytic endoribonuclease RNase E, which initiates the rate-limiting step in RNA degradation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Del Campo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">McDowall et al., 1995</a>). Subsequent degradation is carried out by the 3\u2019-5\u2019 phosphorolytic exoribonuclease PNPase (polynucleotide phosphorylase) assisted by the ATP-dependent helicase RhlB (both of which are components of the degradosome assembly) and is completed by an oligo-ribonuclease which is not associated to the complex (<a href=\"#bib15\">Evguenieva-Hackenberg and Klug, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">G\u00f3rna et al., 2012</a>).

Despite the predicted lack of structure within the scaffold domain, several short segments having structural propensity were identified in the <i>E. coli</i> CTH that mediate the interaction between RNase E and the cell membrane, enolase and PNPase. Moreover, the CTH contains two arginine-rich regions that have been shown to bind RNA: the RNA binding domain (RBD)/Arginine-rich region 1 (AR1) and AR2 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Callaghan et al., 2004</a>). The activity and specificity of the RNA degradosome is under complex regulation and is influenced by several factors including riboregulation by small, non-coding RNAs (sRNA) and proteins RraA and RraB (\u2018Regulators of RNase Activity A and B\u2019) that inhibit the activity of RNase E by binding to the CTH (<a href=\"#bib17\">G\u00f3rna et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ikeda et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>)."

Three cases have been reported in which the machinery of RNA decay is a target of phage effector proteins. In one, <i>E. coli</i> phage T7 heavily phosphorylates the CTH of RNase E and RhlB, leading to the inhibition of RNA degradation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Marchand et al., 2001</a>). In a second example, the Srd protein encoded by <i>E. coli</i> phage T4 was found to increase the activity of RNase E on host mRNA by binding to the catalytic NTH (<a href=\"#bib27\">Qi et al., 2015</a>). This may account for earlier observations that, during infection by phage T4, the host mRNA was destabilized while the phage mRNA was stabilized (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ueno and Yonesaki, 2004</a>). Finally, an increase in the expression of RNase E was observed during the infection of <i>Prochlorococcus</i> MED4 by cyanophage P-SSP7, due to elevated levels of an RNase E mRNA variant lacking the 5\u2019UTR responsible for the negative feedback regulation of the gene. In parallel, antisense RNAs derived from the phage sequester the P-SSP7 transcriptome to form dsRNA, which is subsequently protected from degradation by RNase E (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sesto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Stazic et al., 2016</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2011</a>)."

By performing a screen based on affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we observed that a previously uncharacterised phage protein specifically binds to two RNA binding sites within the CTH of RNase E, and by doing so efficiently inhibits the RNA binding and degradation activity of the degradosome assembly. We have determined the structure of this protein (termed Dip, \u2018degradosome interacting protein\u2019) by X-ray crystallography and show that it forms an open-clamp like homo-dimeric structure, and binding of Dip to RNA binding regions within RNase E is characterized functionally and structurally. To our knowledge, Dip is the first known viral protein which effectively inhibits the RNA degradation activity of its host via a direct protein:protein interaction."

The CTH was divided into ten overlapping fragments based on homology to molecular recognition sites within RNase E of <i>E. coli</i> and predictions of protein-protein binding sites by the online tool ANCHOR (<a href=\"#bib12\">Doszt\u00e1nyi et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Two fragments (delineating the region 583\u2013607 of RNase E) yielded a positive signal on selective medium for one vector combination (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, fragments A and E). However, this signal could not be confirmed using Miller assays (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). For three other fragments (all-encompassing residues 756\u2013835 of RNase E, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> fragments C, F and I), a strong signal was produced for all vector combinations and could be positively confirmed in subsequent Miller assays (p&lt;0.05) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B\u2013C</a>, fragments C, F and I). Combining these results, a clear interaction site can be defined within residues 756 to 835, while a weak second interaction site may be present within residues 583\u2013607. These binding sites were subsequently verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> demonstrates that the mobility of Dip is altered upon addition of increasing concentrations of 583\u2013607 (fused to a GST-tag), with all of the Dip being shifted at an approximate 10-fold excess of the RNase E fragment. When using a slightly larger fragment of RNase E (residues 583\u2013636), Dip is shifted completely by only a four-fold excess of the GST-fusion protein. This suggests that efficient Dip binding requires a larger region of RNase E than the first defined segment of residues 583\u2013607. This might also explain why the bacterial two-hybrid assay with residues 583\u2013607 and Dip was inconclusive."

Dip is efficiently shifted at just a 1:1 ratio to the different fragments, suggesting stronger binding to residues 756\u2013775 than 583\u2013636 of RNase E. To ensure that the binding is not mediated by the presence of RNA, an additional EMSA was performed using 9S rRNA and increasing amounts of Dip. Since no shift of the RNA was observed (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we conclude that Dip is not an RNA binding protein. Therefore, the interaction between Dip and the 583\u2013636 and 756\u2013775 regions of RNase E of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is via a direct protein-protein interaction."

These findings suggest that the binding sites of Dip may be conserved in RNase E of other bacteria. To investigate whether Dip is capable of binding to the RNA degradosome of other species, an in vitro pull down was performed using his-tagged Dip and <i>E. coli</i> cell lysate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The RNA degradosome components RNase E and PNPase, and the ribosomal protein L13 were identified as the predominant bands identified by mass spectrometry, while two other canonical degradosome proteins, RhlB and enolase, were also identified. An EMSA using purified recombinant proteins corresponding to the CTH of <i>E. coli</i> RNase E equally showed a clear shift of Dip in the presence of the CTH at the 1:1 molar ratio (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

However when using the larger 9S rRNA (245 nt, precursor of 5S rRNA), a clear shift can be observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). As with the 756\u2013775 binding site, 9S rRNA can be competitively displaced from the 583\u2013636 fragment by Dip, and the addition of a 4-fold excess of Dip is able to completely remove the bound RNA from the RNase E fragment. These results demonstrate that Dip targets both RNA binding sites in the C-terminal half of the RNA degradosome, and consequently blocks the binding of RNA to the RNase E subunit."

A well characterised and conserved activity of RNase E is the processing of 9S ribosomal RNA to the precursor p5S (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cormack and Mackie, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hardwick et al., 2011</a>). We tested 9S rRNA of <i>E. coli</i> as a substrate for in vitro activity assays using both the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and the <i>E. coli</i> RNA degradosome in the presence and absence of Dip. First, Dip itself was tested for RNase activity towards the 9S rRNA fragment. After incubating the RNA fragment with the phage protein for 30\u2009min, no RNA degradation was observed (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Next, the RNA degradosomes were incubated with 9S rRNA in the absence of Dip, resulting in efficient RNA processing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). With increasing amounts of Dip, the processing of 9S rRNA is visibly reduced, with almost no cleavage observed in the presence of a 10-fold access of Dip. Therefore, we conclude that Dip inhibits the processing activity of the RNA degradosome of both <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>E. coli</i>. To verify if these observations are specifically due to the binding of Dip to the scaffold domain of RNase E, an in vitro degradation assay was performed using only the catalytic domain of <i>E. coli</i> RNase E (residues 1\u2013525). We noted that RNase E was still capable of processing 9S RNA (albeit less efficiently than the full degradosome), but no inhibition of the degradation activity could be observed in the presence of Dip (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), demonstrating that Dip does not directly influence the activity of the catalytic domain."

Secondary structure prediction of this RNase E peptide in isolation suggested a high propensity towards a helical conformation. Therefore, this helical form of the peptide was used in a docking experiment intended to scan the complete surface of Dip with the DOT docking program (<a href=\"#bib29\">Roberts et al., 2013</a>).

Hexagonal crystals of Dip were obtained containing an apparent ring-like hexamer of Dip formed through crystallographic symmetry. Discontinuous density was observed on the surface of Dip in the DOT docking predicted acidic pocket (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Processing the X-ray diffraction data in the lower symmetry P1 space group visibly improved the density for the RNase E peptide, and we were able to cautiously model eight amino acids of the peptide into this density. The model of Dip bound to the short RNase E recognition peptide (Dip:RNaseE<sub>756-775</sub>) indicated significant contacts are made between residues Asp 137, Asp138, Glu 214 and Glu 222 of Dip and the RNase E peptide (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D</a>). To confirm the importance of these residues in the interaction between the two proteins, several mutants of Dip were generated where the acidic residues on the surface of Dip were substituted for alanine. A double mutation of Glu 214 and Glu 222 to alanine was sufficient to completely abolish the interaction with both Dip binding sites on RNase E when assessed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Moreover, the in vivo expression of the Dip-E214A/E222A mutant using the pHERD20T vector restored the wild type phenotype compared to the curly morphology obtained by in vivo Dip expression (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Interestingly, electron density for an unknown small molecule ligand can be seen in this region in the structure of apo-Dip, which we have modelled as a single arginine amino acid. The E214A-E222A mutant of Dip was subsequently crystallized in the same P2<sub>1</sub> space group as the wild type Dip protein, and amino acid mutations were confirmed by the absence of electron density for glutamate side chains at positions 214 and 222 in the 2.2 angstrom resolution map. There were no other significant alterations to the local or overall structure of Dip (data not shown). These data show that the acidic patch on the outer surface of Dip is crucial for the interaction with RNase E, and both of the RNA binding segments of RNase E engage Dip via this region."

The binding targets of this <span class=\"underline\">d</span>egradosome <span class=\"underline\">i</span>nteracting <span class=\"underline\">p</span>rotein could be clearly defined as two RNA-binding sites within the C-terminus of RNase E (residues 583\u2013636 and 756\u2013775).

Finally, the possibility that a single Dip dimer may bind to two separate RNase E protomers cannot be dismissed, especially considering that RNase E is a tetrameric enzyme, and the four protomers may be in proximity in a single degradosome assembly (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>)."

Our preferred explanation for these findings is that the RNA binding sites found in the CTH are particularly important for the recognition of RNA substrates that harbour secondary structure elements. Potentially these substrates require unwinding by an RNA helicase bound close to these regions of RNase E prior to cleavage by the NTH of RNase E. Therefore, the binding of structured RNAs to the RNA binding sites of the scaffold domain of RNase E can be crucial for efficient processing. In this respect phage \u03c6KZ and Dip act in a similar manner to phage T7 which phosphorylates the scaffold domain of RNase E to protect its transcripts from degradation by the host (<a href=\"#bib23\">Marchand et al., 2001</a>)."

                        "text": "Taking together our in vitro and in vivo results, it could be expected that the levels of RNA during a \u03c6KZ infection would be high, since both degradation of bacterial and phage RNA by the RNA degradosome are affected. Indeed, RNAseq data show that the total amount of cellular RNA extracted increased over five-fold during infection (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ceyssens et al., 2014</a>). However, it was found that 35\u2009min after the start of infection, 98.5% of the non-rRNA and non-tRNA could be mapped to the phage genome, suggesting a decrease of host RNA. Therefore, we hypothesize that at the start of infection by \u03c6KZ the bacterial RNA might be actively degraded. The mechanism for this is unclear, but could involve inhibition of the host RNA polymerase to impede nascent transcript genesis, and in parallel, the acceleration of host RNA decay by a yet uncharacterized enzyme of \u03c6KZ or a \u03c6KZ encoded activator of the hosts RNA degradation machinery. The production of the degradosome activating protein Srd by phage T4 has recently been reported (<a href=\"#bib27\">Qi et al., 2015</a>), and although a homologue of Srd cannot be identified in the \u03c6KZ genome it is plausible that a functionally equivalent protein may be produced during the early stage of infection. Subsequently, Dip is produced to inhibit the activity of the RNA degradosome and protect the newly synthesized phage RNA. Since Western blot analyses indicate that Dip persists once it is produced, the stability of phage RNA can be maintained during the entire infection cycle. It remains to be determined whether the production of Dip is essential for efficient infection by phage \u03c6KZ."

The function of these proteins opens the possibility that the modulation of RNA degradosome activity might be a recurrent strategy of bacteriophages to support efficient phage infection. The inhibition of bacterial host nucleases by phage encoded proteins may be a more common strategy than had previously been appreciated. Recently it has been shown that the CRISPR-Cas system of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> can be inhibited by several phage encoded proteins (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bondy-denomy et al., 2015</a>), two of which act by binding and blocking DNA binding sites on the CRISPR-cas machinery, reminiscent of the mode of action of Dip. Moreover, the observation that Dip also has an inhibitory effect on the RNA degradosome of <i>E. coli</i>, suggests that the RNA binding sites within the CTD of RNase E are more conserved (either at sequence or structure level) than had previously been thought. Therefore, it can be speculated that there may exist functional homologues of Dip in other phages that target host machinery of RNA metabolism. Finally, the identification and biological understanding of the function of Dip opens the possibility of developing of new biotechnological tools to modulate RNA turn over and regulation in bacteria."

Carrying out RNAseq analyses during \u03c6KZ infection is practically not feasible due to the difficulties in normalizing results. As demonstrated by Ceyssens et al. 2014, in parallel to the decay of host RNA, host DNA is degraded during infection by \u03c6KZ so that it is not possible to normalize data to the DNA content. Also, experiments comparing wild-type phage to a Dip deletion mutant are not currently possible because there are no readily available approaches to genetically manipulate phiKZ phages, hence the requirement of expression of exogenous Dip from a plasmid. An antisense RNA expression inhibition approach proved unsuccessful."
