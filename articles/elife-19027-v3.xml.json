Here we experimentally dissect the functions of two pairs of ancient paralogs of the <i>GAL</i>actose sugar utilization network in two yeast species. We show that the <i>Saccharomyces uvarum</i> network is more active, even as over-induction is prevented by a second co-repressor that the model yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> lacks. Surprisingly, removal of this repression system leads to a strong growth arrest, likely due to overly rapid galactose catabolism and metabolic overload. Alternative sugars, such as fructose, circumvent metabolic control systems and exacerbate this phenotype. We further show that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> experiences homologous metabolic constraints that are subtler due to how the paralogs have diversified. These results show how the functional differentiation of paralogs continues to shape regulatory network architectures and metabolic strategies long after initial preservation."

Here we experimentally dissect the functions of two pairs of ancient paralogs of the <i>GAL</i>actose sugar utilization network in two yeast species. We show that the <i>Saccharomyces uvarum</i> network is more active, even as over-induction is prevented by a second co-repressor that the model yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> lacks. Surprisingly, removal of this repression system leads to a strong growth arrest, likely due to overly rapid galactose catabolism and metabolic overload. Alternative sugars, such as fructose, circumvent metabolic control systems and exacerbate this phenotype. We further show that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> experiences homologous metabolic constraints that are subtler due to how the paralogs have diversified. These results show how the functional differentiation of paralogs continues to shape regulatory network architectures and metabolic strategies long after initial preservation."

Theoretical studies have proposed that the fates of duplicate genes are rapidly determined after gene duplication events (<a href=\"#bib73\">Moore and Purugganan, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</a>). These models generally treat the preservation of duplicate genes as a race to distinguish their functions prior to the complete inactivation of one of the redundant paralogs, either through neutral (<a href=\"#bib33\">Force et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Lynch et al., 2001</a>) or adaptive changes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Clark, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Lynch et al., 2001</a>). Regardless of the initial functional changes or dosage effects facilitating the fixation of paralogs, retention is not the end of their evolutionary paths (<a href=\"#bib41\">Gordon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Conant et al., 2014</a>)."

We show that homologous constraints exist in a milder form in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, and the degree of metabolic constraint is affected by how <i>GAL</i> network paralogs have diversified between the species. These results show how, after a hundred of million of years of preservation, two pairs of interacting duplicate genes have continued to diverge functionally in ways that broadly impact metabolism, regulatory network structures, and the future evolutionary trajectories available."

They are almost completely subfunctionalized: ScerGAL3 lost its galactokinase activity and became a dedicated co-inducer, whereas ScerGAL1 lost most of its co-inducer activity but maintains galactokinase activity (<a href=\"#bib81\">Platt and Reece, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Platt et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Timson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Hittinger and Carroll, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Lavy et al., 2016</a>). Unlike ScerGal3, SuvaGal3 retains a -Ser-Ala- dipeptide in its active site that is sufficient to weakly restore galactokinase activity when added back to ScerGal3 (<a href=\"#bib82\">Platt et al., 2000</a>), so we hypothesized that <i>SuvaGAL3</i> encodes a functional galactokinase. To test this hypothesis, we precisely replaced the coding sequence of <i>ScerGAL1</i>, the gene encoding the sole galactokinase in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib82\">Platt et al., 2000</a>), with <i>SuvaGAL3</i> in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.

Surprisingly, the <i>S. uvarum gal3</i> null mutant did not show the classic Long-Term Adaptation (LTA) phenotype of the <i>S. cerevisiae gal3</i> null mutant (<a href=\"#bib105\">Tsuyumu and Adams, 1973</a>). Instead of a growth delay of multiple days, we observed a delay of only a few hours in <i>S. uvarum gal3\u2206</i> relative to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These results suggest that other genes in <i>S. uvarum</i> may be able to partially compensate for the deletion of <i>SuvaGAL3</i>, such as its paralog, <i>SuvaGAL1</i>. To determine whether <i>GAL1</i> differences between <i>S. uvarum</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> might be responsible for the different <i>gal3</i> null phenotypes, we replaced the <i>SuvaGAL1</i> coding sequence or promoter sequence with their <i>ScerGAL1</i> counterparts in the background of <i>S. uvarum gal3\u2206</i>. The <i>ScerGAL1</i> promoter swap in <i>S. uvarum gal3\u2206</i> largely recapitulated LTA, while the <i>ScerGAL1</i> coding sequence swap extended the delay to a lesser extent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Since the <i>GAL1-GAL10</i> promoter is a divergent promoter, genetic modifications (evolved or engineered) inevitably impact both genes, as well as perhaps a lncRNA previously described in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cloutier et al., 2016</a>). These results suggest that differences at the <i>GAL1</i> locus, especially within this promoter, are primarily responsible for the lack of LTA in the <i>S. uvarum gal3\u2206</i> mutant. Overall, the data suggest that <i>SuvaGAL1</i> is functionally redundant with <i>SuvaGAL3</i> to a much greater extent than are <i>ScerGAL1</i> and <i>ScerGAL3</i>. Thus, it is likely that the homologs in the common ancestor of <i>S. uvarum</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> were more functionally redundant than in modern <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, and considerable subfunctionalization between <i>ScerGAL1</i> and <i>ScerGAL3</i> happened after the divergence of <i>S. uvarum</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i>."

This result stands in sharp contrast to the observation that <i>S. cerevisiae gal80</i> null mutant strains from multiple genetic backgrounds (the lab strains S288c, W303, and R21, as well as the vineyard strain RM11-1a examined here) grew faster in galactose, a phenotype shared with <i>Saccharomyces kudriavzevii gal80</i> null mutants and attributed to the\u00a0constitutive <i>GAL</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib104\">Torchia et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Segr\u00e8 et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Hittinger et al., 2010</a>). This growth arrest was not a genetic engineering artifact; reintroducing <i>SuvaGAL80</i> completely rescued the growth arrest, and knocking out these two genes with different markers produced the same mutant phenotype (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). More importantly, introducing <i>ScerGAL80</i> completely rescued the growth arrest (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that the TGA phenotype was not due to novel molecular functions specific to <i>SuvaGAL80</i> or <i>SuvaGAL80B</i>. Instead, the dramatically varied phenotypes imply that these two species have different regulatory or metabolic wiring for galactose metabolism."

We identified genes as <i>GAL</i> network members if and only if they were: (1) significantly up-regulated in <i>S. uvarum gal80\u2206 gal80b\u2206</i> compared to the wild-type at FDR\u00a0=\u00a00.05 (35 genes); (2) up-regulated by at least two-fold (19 genes); (3) up-regulated in both glucose and glycerol (nine genes); and (4) predicted to contain Gal4 consensus binding sites (CGGN<sub>11</sub>CCG) upstream of their coding sequences. Using these stringent criteria, we found eight potential <i>GAL</i> network members in <i>S. uvarum</i>, seven of which were shared with <i>S. cerevisiae</i> based on previous chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene expression data (<i>GAL1</i>, <i>GAL2</i>, <i>GAL2B</i>, <i>GAL7</i>, <i>GAL10</i>, <i>MEL1</i>, and <i>GCY1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib104\">Torchia et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Ren et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). <i>GAL3</i>, a well-established Gal4 target in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, was considered differentially expressed using less stringent criteria, but orthologs of two other known targets were not (<i>MTH1</i> and <i>PCL10</i>). The sole novel <i>GAL</i> network member in <i>S. uvarum</i> was the <i>PGM1</i> gene, which was up-regulated 26-fold in 5% glycerol in <i>S. uvarum gal80\u2206 gal80b\u2206</i> relative to wild-type. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, <i>PGM1</i> encodes the minor isoform of phosphoglucomutase, which, along with Pgm2, connects the Leloir pathway to glycolysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Notwithstanding the <i>PGM1</i> gene, we conclude that the <i>S. uvarum</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae GAL</i> networks have similar compositions, and the handful of differences do not seem to readily explain the remarkably strong and unexpected TGA phenotype seen in <i>S. uvarum</i> strains lacking their co-repressors."

Fructose, mannose, and glucose are all primarily catabolized through glycolysis, but only glucose generates glycolytic intermediates that are upstream of the trehalose cycle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Thus, fructose and mannose are expected to contribute directly to metabolic overload with minimal offsetting effects from the trehalose cycle. If the interaction between glycolytic load and the trehalose cycle were important to the TGA phenotype, growing the double mutant in mixtures of galactose with fructose or mannose would exacerbate the growth arrest. In contrast, if the TGA phenotype were caused by galactose-specific metabolism, the addition of these more preferred sugars would have no effect, or perhaps mitigate the TGA phenotype. Consistent with the TGA phenotype being caused by a general overloading of upper glycolysis, both fructose and mannose strongly exacerbated the TGA phenotype in <i>S. uvarum gal80\u2206 gal80b\u2206</i>, while glucose partially rescued the TGA phenotype (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Importantly, mixing fructose or mannose with galactose had much stronger defects than the identical amounts of galactose alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Co-culturing wild-type <i>S. uvarum</i> strains in galactose with these sugars was not inherently toxic (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), so the presence of the co-repressors allows cells to cope with this challenge. Growing <i>S. uvarum gal80\u2206 gal80b\u2206</i> in fructose, mannose, or glucose alone also did not cause growth defects (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Moreover, deleting <i>GAL1</i> completely rescued the TGA phenotype in the co-repressor double mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), while mixtures of mannose and galactose dramatically increased the levels of ROS in <i>S. uvarum gal80\u2206 gal80b\u2206</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), implying that the phenotypic enhancement caused by this sugar mixture acts through the same mechanism observed in galactose alone. Collectively, these results suggest that overly rapid catabolism of sugars can lead to general metabolic and growth defects when the appropriate futile metabolic cycles and negative feedback regulatory loops are not able to slow down catabolism."

Recent work has convincingly shown that the <i>S. uvarum GAL</i> network is more transcriptionally active than the <i>S. cerevisiae GAL</i> network, especially in non-inducing and mixed sugar conditions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Caudy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Roop et al., 2016</a>). Thus, we wondered whether <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>S. uvarum</i> galactose catabolism might be under qualitatively similar constraints, even as the more poised and active state of the <i>S. uvarum GAL</i> network might render it more vulnerable to metabolic overload. First, we examined <i>S. cerevisiae gal80</i> null mutants more closely and found a similar but less-pronounced early rapid increase in optical density, followed by a brief but reproducible TGA phenotype (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, inset). This observation was missed by earlier studies, which were focused on later time points, because <i>S. cerevisiae gal80</i> null mutants eventually grow much faster on galactose (<a href=\"#bib104\">Torchia et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Segr\u00e8 et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Hittinger et al., 2010</a>).

Many of the differences between the <i>S. uvarum</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae GAL</i> networks can be explained as offering alternative protective strategies, while affording varied catabolic capabilities. For instance, the direct regulation of the <i>PGM1</i> gene by Gal4 would enhance the connection between the Leloir pathway and glycolysis in <i>S. uvarum</i> relative to <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Fu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Ostergaard et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Garcia Sanchez et al., 2010</a>). <i>S. uvarum PGM1</i> is highly induced by galactose (<a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), but this likely ancestral regulatory connection was lost in the <i>S. cerevisiae-S. kudriavzevii</i> clade (<a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Nearly all of the known differences between the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>S. uvarum GAL</i> networks make <i>S. uvarum</i> more active, including (1) apparent regulation of <i>PGM1</i> by Gal4; (2) the presence of genes encoding two galactose transporters (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>); (3) the galactokinase activity of SuvaGal3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>); (4) the higher activity of both the <i>GAL1</i> coding and cis-regulatory sequences (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>); and (5) higher background gene expression across the network (<a href=\"#bib16\">Caudy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Roop et al., 2016</a>). Indeed, the possession of a gene encoding a second co-repressor appears to be one of the few features of the <i>S. uvarum GAL</i> network that would serve to counteract its higher activity. Thus, the dramatic up-regulation of <i>GAL80B</i> during induction may offer a robust negative feedback loop that helps prevent over-induction and metabolic overload. The retention of <i>GAL80B</i> may have allowed <i>S. uvarum</i> to maintain a more active <i>GAL</i> network, while the <i>S. cerevisiae GAL</i> network evolved lower activity."

Based on the redundancy observed between <i>GAL1</i> and <i>GAL3</i> and between <i>GAL80</i> and <i>GAL80B</i> in <i>S. uvarum</i>, we infer that the functions of these two paralog pairs overlapped more at the origin of the genus <i>Saccharomyces</i> than in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). After the <i>S. uvarum-S. eubayanus</i> clade diverged from the <i>S. arboricola-S. cerevisiae</i> clade, these genes met distinct fates in different lineages (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). <i>GAL80B</i> was lost in the <i>S. cerevisiae-S. arboricola</i> clade, while it was retained in <i>S. uvarum</i> and <i>S. eubayanus</i> (<a href=\"#bib45\">Hittinger et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Scannell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Caudy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Hittinger, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Liti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Baker et al., 2015</a>).

In the lineage leading to <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, Gal3 completely lost enzymatic activity, while a decrease in the promoter activity of its paralog <i>GAL1</i> reduced, but did not eliminate, its ability to induce the network rapidly. Other <i>GAL</i> genes also experienced an adaptive decrease in promoter activities in the lineage leading to <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib91\">Roop et al., 2016</a>), which may have been enabled or necessitated by the loss of the secondary co-repressor encoded by <i>GAL80B</i>. Remarkably, the disparate resolutions of the functions of these paralogs did not happen soon after the WGD that created them. Instead, the diversification described here occurred within the last 10 million years of a 100 million year history, demonstrating that the echoes of duplication events continue to resonate through gene networks much longer than is generally appreciated (<a href=\"#bib41\">Gordon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Conant et al., 2014</a>)."

Molecular and genetic dissection is much more challenging in these systems, but there are hints that the diversification of ancient paralogs continues to have functional consequences for the evolution of metabolism (<a href=\"#bib99\">Steinke et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Conant et al., 2014</a>) and development (<a href=\"#bib56\">Kassahn et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Cortesi et al., 2015</a>). Paralog diversification is often asymmetric as one paralog acquires a more specialized or auxiliary role (<a href=\"#bib33\">Force et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Moore and Purugganan, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Hittinger and Carroll, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Des Marais and Rausher, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Conant et al., 2014</a>). Even if this specialization is conditionally adaptive, the auxiliary paralog can become more susceptible to gene loss when conditions change. Paralog loss ends the saga of duplicate gene diversification, possibly forcing partially redundant functions back onto the remaining paralog, relieving paralog interference (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baker et al., 2013</a>), or leading to compensatory changes elsewhere in the network. Perhaps more interestingly, paralog loss eliminates redundancy and limits the long-term potential for adaptation. The ongoing evolutionary processes affecting the <i>GAL</i> paralogs show how gene duplication facilitates phenotypic change and network diversification in ways that continue to reverberate."

To perform allele swaps, the coding sequence or promoter was first replaced by a selectable and counter-selectable <i>TK-hphMX</i> cassette, which does not require the\u00a0prior introduction of an auxotrophy (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 2014</a>). The coding sequence or promoter of the desired replacement sequence was amplified by PCR primers with overhangs homologous to the targeted genomic flanking region. In some cases, extended homology (100\u2013300 bp) was then introduced through PCR sewing. For each <i>GAL1</i> promoter swap, we swapped the entire upstream intergenic region. Note that the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>S. uvarum GAL1</i> promoters are both divergent promoters that also regulate <i>GAL10</i> and may also impact a lncRNA previously described in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cloutier et al., 2016</a>). Successful replacement strains were isolated by selecting for the loss of thymidine kinase activity by resistance to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR), as well as the loss of resistance to hygromycin by replica plating (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 2014</a>). GFP reporters were constructed in three parts: the <i>hphMX</i> cassette was placed upstream as the selection marker, the <i>S. uvarum GAL1</i> promoter was used to drive the expression of the reporter, and the reporter was a <i>yEGFP</i> (yeast Enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein) construct with a <i>S. cerevisiae CYC1</i> terminator that was amplified from FM1282 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Hittinger and Carroll, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Hittinger et al., 2010</a>). GFP reporters were introduced to replace <i>S. uvarum gto1</i>, an inactive pseudogene (chr7: 767,328\u2013766,478) orthologous to <i>S. cerevisiae GTO1</i> (<a href=\"#bib95\">Scannell et al., 2011</a>). The modified loci of all transformants were verified by Sanger sequencing. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is NCBITaxon:4932, <i>S. uvarum</i> is NCBITaxon:230603, and the strains used in this study are listed in <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>."

Next, a single colony of each strain was cultured in synthetic complete (SC) medium plus 0.2% glucose (1.72 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5 g/L ammonium sulfate, 2 g/L complete dropout mix, 2 g/L glucose) for 2\u20133 days, a condition that does not induce and only minimally represses the <i>GAL</i> network. There were at least two biological replicates for each genotype, generally from independent transformants. These pre-cultures were washed with water and inoculated into the desired growth media in a 96 well plate. No explicit power analyses were performed to determine sample sizes or the number of replicates. Instead, each experiment was independently performed at least twice on separate days; details can be found in each legend. Biological replicates were defined as independent isogenic colonies on agar plates, which were used for subsequent precultures and growth assays; technical replicates were defined as independent growth assays from the same preculture. The absorbance of each well was read by an unshaken BMG FLUOstar Omega plate reader every 10 min at 595 nm. The number of cell divisions for each time point was calculated as log<sub>2</sub>[(OD<sub>strain\u2212</sub>OD<sub>media</sub>)/(OD<sub>start\u2212</sub>OD<sub>media</sub>), an equation that normalized each optical density time point to its starting optical density and the optical density of the medium. The times to first doubling were calculated as the times for the optical densities to double from their normalized starting points. Specific growth rates were calculated using the Growth Curve Analysis Tool (GCAT) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bukhman et al., 2015</a>). Replicates that failed to grow as precultures or during growth assays were considered as outliers and were excluded from subsequent analyses; no other data were excluded. For <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>S. uvarum gal1</i> mutant growth assays (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), strains were pre-cultured in SC plus 0.67% fructose for 2 days and inoculated at a 1:1000 ratio into supplemented minimal medium (1.72 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5 g/L ammonium sulfate, 85.6 mg/L uracil, 85.6 mg/L lysine, 20 g/L galactose) plus 2% galactose or no carbon source. The growth properties of these strains were determined by subtracting the optical densities of cultures in media without a carbon source from media with galactose; differences less than 0.05 were considered as 'no growth.' In each case, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> strains were cultured at 30\u02daC, while <i>S. uvarum</i> strains were cultured at 24\u02daC, except when they were cultured in the same 96 well plate. In these cases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), strains were grown at 26\u02daC, and the results were summarized in one graph."

Chromatographic separations based on a previously described method (<a href=\"#bib108\">van Dam et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Long et al., 2012</a>) were carried out on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC comprising a vacuum degasser, binary pump, heated column compartment, and thermostated autosampler set to maintain 6\u02daC. Mobile phase A (MPA) was 0.5 mM NaOH, and mobile phase B (MPB) was 100 mM NaOH. 20 \u03bcL of intracellular extract or calibrant standard mixture was separated on a Dionex IonPac AS11-HC IC column (2.0 mm x 250 mm, 9.0 \u00b5m) held at 40\u00b0C using a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min. Metabolite elution was achieved by first holding at 5% MPB for 22.5 min to separate isobaric phosphosugar species. MPB was then linearly increased from 5% to 100% over 27.5 min to elute the remaining metabolites. MPB was held at 100% for 7 min for column cleaning followed by an 8 min re-equilibration step at 5% MPB. The LC system was coupled to a Dionex ERS 500 suppressor controlled by a Dionex Reagent-Free Controller (model RFC-10) and an Agilent 6460 A Triple Quadrupole MS. The MS was operated in negative mode, acquiring MRM scans for each metabolite. Quantification based off external standard calibration curves and correction with the <sup>13</sup>C-labelled yeast standard was performed with Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Analysis software (version B.06.00)."

This stands in contrast to the growth advantage in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> upon deletion of its one <i>GAL80</i> copy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Transcriptomic and metabolomic experiments show that in this <i>S. uvarum</i> double mutant in galactose, during a short burst of rapid growth followed by arrest, glycolysis is upregulated and the TCA cycle is repressed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Deleting <i>GAL1</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) or replacing the <i>GAL1</i> promoter with the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> allele (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) was sufficient to rescue the transient growth arrest phenotype of the <i>S. uvarum</i> double <i>GAL80</i> mutant, at least in conditions when galactose was mixed with other sugars. Thus the <i>S. uvarum GAL1</i> promoter, seemingly by virtue of its high activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), is a driver of the transient growth arrest of the <i>S. uvarum</i> double <i>GAL80</i> mutant, at least in mixed sugar media. The hyperactivity of the <i>S. uvarum GAL1</i> promoter is further underlined by the finding that only it, and not the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> allele of the <i>GAL1</i> promoter, can compensate for the loss of <i>GAL3</i> in an <i>S. cerevisiae</i> background during growth in galactose (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The authors' model is that the transient growth arrest phenotype of the <i>S. uvarum</i> double <i>GAL80</i> mutant accrues from overzealous galactose metabolism leading to a broader \"metabolic overload.\" Strictly speaking, any mechanistic role for the suite of expression and metabolite changes seen in this double mutant is not shown."

Indeed, they show that <i>GAL80b</i> in <i>S. uvarum</i> is a stronger repressor of <i>GAL1</i> than is <i>GAL80</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). More support for fitness-relevant functions of <i>GAL80b</i> could strengthen the manuscript. Since <i>GAL80</i> alone is sufficient to prevent the transient growth arrest that otherwise manifests in the <i>S. uvarum</i> double <i>GAL80</i> mutant in pure galactose (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), any benefit of <i>GAL80b</i> wouldn't be in this condition. Rather, the <i>GAL80b</i> mutant in <i>S. uvarum</i> has a slight growth defect in a mixed sugar environment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; it would be good to show the <i>GAL80</i> mutant also in this figure).

This stands in contrast to the growth advantage in S. cerevisiae upon deletion of its one GAL80 copy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Transcriptomic and metabolomic experiments show that in this S. uvarum double mutant in galactose, during a short burst of rapid growth followed by arrest, glycolysis is upregulated and the TCA cycle is repressed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Deleting GAL1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) or replacing the GAL1 promoter with the S. cerevisiae allele (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) was sufficient to rescue the transient growth arrest phenotype of the S. uvarum double GAL80 mutant, at least in conditions when galactose was mixed with other sugars. Thus the S. uvarum GAL1 promoter, seemingly by virtue of its high activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), is a driver of the transient growth arrest of the S. uvarum double GAL80 mutant, at least in mixed sugar media. The hyperactivity of the S. uvarum GAL1 promoter is further underlined by the finding that only it, and not the S. cerevisiae allele of the GAL1 promoter, can compensate for the loss of GAL3 in an S. cerevisiae background during growth in galactose (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The authors' model is that the transient growth arrest phenotype of the S. uvarum double GAL80 mutant accrues from overzealous galactose metabolism leading to a broader \"metabolic overload.\" Strictly speaking, any mechanistic role for the suite of expression and metabolite changes seen in this double mutant is not shown.</i> "
