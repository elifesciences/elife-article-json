                    "text": "The auxiliary \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels are extracellular membrane-associated proteins, which are post-translationally cleaved into disulfide-linked polypeptides \u03b1<sub>2</sub> and \u03b4. We now show, using \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 constructs containing artificial cleavage sites, that this processing is an essential step permitting voltage-dependent activation of plasma membrane N-type (Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2) calcium channels. Indeed, uncleaved \u03b12\u03b4 inhibits native calcium currents in mammalian neurons. By inducing acute cell-surface proteolytic cleavage of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4, voltage-dependent activation of channels is promoted, independent from the trafficking role of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4. Uncleaved \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 does not support trafficking of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channel complexes into neuronal processes, and inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into synaptic boutons, and we can reverse this by controlled intracellular proteolytic cleavage. We propose a model whereby uncleaved \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits maintain immature calcium channels in an inhibited state. Proteolytic processing of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 then permits voltage-dependent activation of the channels, acting as a checkpoint allowing trafficking only of mature calcium channel complexes into neuronal processes."

We now show, using \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 constructs containing artificial cleavage sites, that this processing is an essential step permitting voltage-dependent activation of plasma membrane N-type (Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2) calcium channels. Indeed, uncleaved \u03b12\u03b4 inhibits native calcium currents in mammalian neurons. By inducing acute cell-surface proteolytic cleavage of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4, voltage-dependent activation of channels is promoted, independent from the trafficking role of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4. Uncleaved \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 does not support trafficking of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channel complexes into neuronal processes, and inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into synaptic boutons, and we can reverse this by controlled intracellular proteolytic cleavage. We propose a model whereby uncleaved \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits maintain immature calcium channels in an inhibited state. Proteolytic processing of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 then permits voltage-dependent activation of the channels, acting as a checkpoint allowing trafficking only of mature calcium channel complexes into neuronal processes."

                        "text": "The \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>) have been identified to be key proteins in synaptic function and synaptogenesis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dickman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kurshan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hoppa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Eroglu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Saheki and Bargmann, 2009</a>). Therefore an understanding of their basic mechanism(s) of action is of paramount importance. Although Ca<sub>V</sub>\u03b11 subunits form the pore and determine the main functional and pharmacological attributes of the channels (<a href=\"#bib11\">Catterall, 2000</a>), the Ca<sub>V</sub>1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels are associated with auxiliary \u03b2 and \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits (<a href=\"#bib25\">Flockerzi et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Witcher et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Takahashi et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 1996</a>). The \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits increase Ca<sub>V</sub> currents by a mechanism that is less well understood than that of the \u03b2 subunits, which have a chaperone function (<a href=\"#bib57\">Van Petegem et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buraei and Yang, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dolphin, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zamponi et al., 2015</a>). The topology of the \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 proteins was initially determined for skeletal muscle \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1, but is likely to generalize for all \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brickley et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gurnett et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">1997</a>). A single gene encodes each \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 protein, which undergoes several post-translational processing steps, including proteolytic cleavage into disulfide-linked \u03b1<sub>2</sub> and \u03b4 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Davies et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jay et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ellis et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">De Jongh et al., 1990</a>). Both \u03b1<sub>2</sub> and \u03b4 have been shown previously to be important for the function of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 to increase Ca<sub>V</sub> currents and influence the biophysical properties of the currents (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gurnett et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">1997</a>). The structure of the skeletal muscle Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 complex has recently been determined at 3.6 \u00c5 by cryo-electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wu et al., 2016</a>). It shows the\u00a0interaction of the \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 with several extracellular linkers in Domains I-III of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1. In particular the metal ion adhesion site (MIDAS) motif of the von Willebrand factor-A (VWA) domain interacts with the extracellular loop between transmembrane segments 1 and 2 in Domain I."

In the present study, we therefore examined whether there was an additional step responsible for promoting Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 calcium current function by \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits, in addition to their demonstrated effect on calcium channel trafficking (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cassidy et al., 2014</a>). We have specifically tested the hypothesis that this step involves the proteolytic processing of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1. Our results show that proteolytic maturation of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits is not only a prerequisite for voltage-dependent activation of calcium channels, but is also an essential checkpoint for trafficking of these mature calcium channels into neuronal processes."

This sequence is strongly conserved in mammals (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We initially manipulated the cleavage site in \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>), in order to determine the extent of mutation required across this site required to completely prevent proteolytic processing. Transient expression in cell lines of wild type (WT) \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 resulted in only partial cleavage into \u03b1<sub>2</sub> and \u03b4 subunits, clearly observed only following deglycosylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>, lanes 1 and 3), compared to the complete proteolytic cleavage observed in brain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>, lanes 2 and 4). Replacing LEAVEM in \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 with a hexavaline (V6) sequence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) completely prevented its proteolytic processing, as shown by the absence of cleaved \u03b1<sub>2</sub>-1 on reducing gels of whole cell lysate (WCL) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). More conservative mutations did not effectively prevent the cleavage (data not shown). However, we found that the lack of proteolytic cleavage did not affect the ability of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>(V6)\u03b4-1 to bind <sup>3</sup>H-gabapentin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>). Furthermore, the \u03b1<sub>2</sub>(V6)\u03b4-1, like wild-type (WT) \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1, was found to be concentrated in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and the K<sub>D</sub> for <sup>3</sup>H-gabapentin binding in DRMs was unchanged, being 76.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.8 nM for WT \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 and 85.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.7 nM for \u03b1<sub>2</sub>(V6)\u03b4-1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>), indicating that the uncleaved pro-form of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 is likely to be correctly folded."

We could confirm this result using \u03b21b-GFP to ensure that all cells examined contain \u03b21b; WT \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 produced an 8.6-fold increase of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2/\u03b21b currents at\u00a0+10 mV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,b</a>).

We therefore first identified a potential cleavage site in \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-3 by sequence alignment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>), and then showed by mutational analysis that a V6 mutation across the predicted cleavage site prevented proteolytic cleavage, determined by the appearance of the \u03b4-3 moiety in a reducing gel (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and also prevented the functional effects of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-3 on Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 currents (data not shown). We then replaced this sequence in \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-3 with the HRV-3C motif, to form \u03b1<sub>2</sub>(3C)\u03b4-3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>).

This up-regulation allowed us to obtain sufficient protein to follow the processing of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1. Following dissection of DRGs and associated axons, we observed that \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 was fully glycosylated in the cell bodies of the DRGs, but remained only partially cleaved into \u03b1<sub>2</sub> and \u03b4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>, tissue segment 3). We have shown previously by electron microscopy that within the cell body, \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 is present both in the endoplasmic reticulum and at the plasma membrane, whereas in axons it is entirely associated with intracellular transport vesicles (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bauer et al., 2009</a>). In the axons, we observed that proteolytic cleavage of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 was complete, both in the spinal nerve (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>, tissue segments 1, 2), and in the dorsal roots (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>, tissue segments 4, 5). This finding implies that all \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 is proteolytically processed prior to intracellular trafficking into DRG axons. Indeed, our biochemical and cell fractionation data indicate that proteolytic cleavage occurs mainly during trafficking to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kadurin et al., 2012</a>) (data not shown). However, this result opens the possibility that uncleaved \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 may reach the cell surface in DRGs cell bodies and have a functional role there."

Our main findings are: firstly that proteolytic cleavage of pro-\u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 represents an essential step for the\u00a0expression of mature functional calcium channels. Here we show, using a combination of techniques, that the appearance of functional Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels associated with the\u00a0proteolytic processing of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits, occurs independently of changes in channel trafficking to the plasma membrane in undifferentiated cell lines. A key experiment is the demonstration that acute restoration of voltage-dependent activation by proteolytic cleavage of pro-\u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 can be induced at the cell surface by extracellularly applied protease. Secondly, we find that lack of proteolytic cleavage of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 represents a very significant barrier to trafficking of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels into cultured hippocampal neuronal processes. Trafficking of the channel complex into neurites is dependent on an effect of mature cleaved \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 on Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2, rather than due primarily to the differential ability of mature \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 to be trafficked and uncleaved pro-\u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 to be retained in the soma. This is clearly shown by the fact that uncleaved \u03b1<sub>2</sub>(3C)\u03b4-1 is fully able to traffic alone into neurites. Thirdly, we provide evidence for an inhibitory role for the pro-form of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1. It is highly likely that proteolytic cleavage of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 could induce a conformational change, which would impact on its interaction with the \u03b1<sub>1</sub>subunit. The recent structure of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 complex resolves the domain structure of the \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 subunit to contain the VWA domain and four tandem cache domains (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wu et al., 2016</a>). The \u03b4 subunit contributes part of the fourth cache domain, and it is therefore possible that the domain organization would be modified by proteolytic cleavage of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4."

We have also found that heterologously-expressed \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits are only partially processed into \u03b1<sub>2</sub> and \u03b4 in all expression systems examined, although proteolytic cleavage was much more marked at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib17\">Davies et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kadurin et al., 2012</a>). The incomplete cleavage of heterologously expressed WT \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 is in contrast to the complete processing of muscle and brain \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jay et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Patel et al., 2013</a>) and cerebellar \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-2 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Davies et al., 2006</a>), and likely represents saturation of the processing enzyme(s). Thus, it was clear that determining the role of proteolytic cleavage of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 on calcium channel function would require additional strategies. A previous study found that various mutations around the cleavage site reduced, but did not abolish, calcium current enhancement by \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 subunits (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrade et al., 2007</a>), leaving the role of proteolytic cleavage of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 an open question. Here we show conclusively that for both \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 and \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-3, mutations that prevent their cleavage into \u03b1<sub>2</sub> and \u03b4 do not prevent the appearance of pro-\u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 on the cell surface. Furthermore, in the cell lines examined here, but not in neurons, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 trafficking to the plasma membrane was enhanced by an uncleaved pro-form of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 to a similar extent as for WT \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1, utilising a mechanism that is independent of the plasma membrane potential. However, this led to the\u00a0increased cell surface expression of a calcium channel complex which appeared to be non-functional, since the uncleaved pro-\u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 did not enhance Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 calcium currents. Thus trafficking of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 to the plasma membrane by \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 subunits in cell lines can be uncoupled from the functional effects of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits on voltage-dependent activation of the channels."

By contrast, a finding that is consistent with the increase in whole-cell current, is that the fraction of null traces was markedly reduced by \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 in unitary current recordings from oocytes expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2/\u03b21b/\u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 (9% null traces), a 3\u20134-fold decrease, compared with those expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 alone (39% null traces) or Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2/\u03b21b (28% null traces) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wakamori et al., 1999</a>). This observation suggests that \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 shifts the equilibrium towards active modes of the channel, from an inactive null mode represented by the long closed state. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4-1 promotes voltage sensor movement of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Savalli et al., 2016</a>), thus hyperpolarizing channel activation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Savalli et al., 2016</a>). Although the interaction of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits with Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels may differ, as there is not such a clear shift in the\u00a0voltage-dependence of activation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kadurin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Canti et al., 2005</a>), it is tempting to speculate that the\u00a0association of the channels with uncleaved pro-\u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 might interfere with voltage sensor movement."

Thus, the proteolytic processing of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 represents an essential checkpoint for neuronal trafficking of calcium channels, to ensure that only mature channel complexes capable of voltage-dependent activation reach specific plasma membrane domains such as presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

They find that a hexa-valine mutation of the putative proteolytic cleavage site in \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 prevents proteolytic processing but allows cell surface expression of the \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunit and normal binding to the Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 channel. Surprisingly, proteolytic processing of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 is required for voltage-dependent activation, indicating a functional role in ion channel regulation for this posttranslational processing reaction. Addition of an exogenous proteolytic cleavage site allows activation of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 function by exogenous protease. Proteolytic processing can occur after insertion into the plasma membrane and can rescue inactive Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 channels there. In cultured DRG neurons, \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits are processed in intracellular compartments, and their proteolytic processing controls trafficking into neurites and synaptic boutons, cell surface expression, and voltage-dependent activation of calcium channel function in nerve terminals. Thus, the authors describe three novel physiological aspects of the function of the \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunit of voltage-gated Ca channels in the context of the N-type channel Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2. Firstly, \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 strongly augments open probability of Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 independent of its role in promoting surface trafficking. Secondly, cleavage of the uncleaved pro-\u03b1<sub>2</sub> is required for this effect, as shown by extremely thorough experiments including acute application of thrombin to a modified \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 in which the endogenous cleavage site has been replaced by a thrombin cleavage site. Thirdly, uncleaved pro-\u03b1<sub>2</sub> inhibits secretory trafficking of Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2 in neurons."

Work from the Dolphin lab and others has shown how the \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunit enhances trafficking in transfected cells and neurons. This manuscript adds a major new dimension by showing that proteolytic processing of this subunit is required for both trafficking to nerve terminals and for activation of the channel at the cell surface. The work is comprehensive and exceptionally well done. The findings are of broad interest, not least because upregulation of Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2, and especially its association with \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4, is a critical aspect of neuropathic pain."

We suggest this is because there are fewer check points in non-neuronal cells for channel trafficking, which do not apply in neurons.
