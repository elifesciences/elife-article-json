Despite a large body of work on the neural control of walking in invertebrates and vertebrates alike, the mechanisms underlying the motor flexibility that is needed to adjust the motor behavior remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated optomotor-induced turning and the neuronal mechanisms underlying the differences between the leg movements of the two body sides in the stick insect <i>Carausius morosus</i>. We present data to show that the generation of turning kinematics in an insect are the combined result of descending unilateral commands that change the leg motor output via task-specific modifications in the processing of local sensory feedback as well as modification of the activity of local central pattern generating networks in a body-side-specific way. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the specificity of such modifications in a defined motor task."

Rhythmic processes such as walking are controlled by networks of neurons called central pattern generators. The resulting movements can be adjusted by feedback from sense organs in response to environmental conditions. For example, sensory feedback that provides information about the load placed on each leg, allows the animal to control the duration of a stance.

Secondly, the motor activity produced by the central pattern generator is modulated to be stronger for the muscle that moves the leg backward on the outside of the curve. At the same time, this activity is stronger for the muscle that moves the leg forward on the inside of the curve. Thirdly, signals from a front leg influence the movement of the other legs on the same side of the body. This influence is strong on the inside and weak on the outside of the curve."

Such demands arise either from the intrinsic need to find food, or a mating partner, or the extrinsic needs to avoid predators or simply overcome obstacles. The investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of locomotion has unraveled considerable detail on how those neural networks that produce the basic motor outputs for swimming, flying and walking of invertebrates and vertebrates are organized and operate (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grillner et al., 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib22\">Goulding, 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib34\">Lehmann, 2004</a>). At the level of the locomotor organs, a basic motor output is the result of the activity of local central pattern generating networks (CPGs), and its adjustment through sensory feedback from the locomotor organs (<a href=\"#bib12\">B\u00fcschges and Gruhn, 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">Pearson, 2008</a>). Particularly important for the control of the step cycle in this context is load (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schmitz and Stein, 2000</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib17\">Duysens et al., 2000</a>). The activity of the CPGs is initiated and modified depending upon the behavioral tasks the animal faces. Evidence suggests that descending signals from brain centers such as reticulospinal neurons in the vertebrate hind brain/basal ganglia (<a href=\"#bib55\">Stephenson-Jones et al., 2011</a>) or the head ganglia of arthropods with the putative arthropod basal ganglia homolog (<a href=\"#bib56\">Strausfeld and Hirth, 2013</a>), the central complex in the cerebral ganglion (<a href=\"#bib58\">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1993</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib27\">Guo and Ritzmann, 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib4\">Bidaye et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2015</a>) contribute to both the basic drive and its modulation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brocard et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib52\">Shik et al., 1969</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2015</a>). How these descending signals influence the motor activity at the level of the local neural networks that control the locomotor organs, however, is only beginning to be understood, in particular for walking, the most ubiquitous form of locomotion in terrestrial animals (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ridgel et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib18\">Dyson et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2015</a>)."

In a six-legged curve walking insect, for example, outside legs push the animal, while inside legs pull the animal into the direction of the curve (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jindrich and Full, 1999</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib19\">D\u00fcrr and Ebeling, 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib25\">Gruhn et al., 2009</a>), sometimes even reversing the stepping direction in single inside legs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gruhn et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib15\">Cruse et al., 2009</a>). Currently, little insight exists, into how the nervous system generates such motor flexibility (<a href=\"#bib27\">Guo and Ritzmann, 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib29\">Huang et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib28\">Hellekes et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib45\">Ridgel et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib20\">Fagerstedt et al., 2001</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib37\">McClellan, 1984</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2015</a>). It seems clear that sensory input from vestibular/antennal or optical areas is processed in the brains of vertebrates and insects alike, and transformed into descending neuronal signals that induce changes in the activity of the local networks which produce the ongoing motor patterns (<a href=\"#bib27\">Guo and Ritzmann, 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib39\">Mu and Ritzmann, 2008a</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib45\">Ridgel et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib58\">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1993</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib29\">Huang et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib41\">Musienko et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib37\">McClellan, 1984</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2015</a>).

In a next step, we investigated the underlying mechanisms by studying the local processing of load signals on the respective inside and outside of the curve. Finally, we investigated the centrally generated local motor output in a deafferented preparation and tested if the observed behavioral changes involved also changes in the activity of local central pattern generating networks."

Likewise, the average period of middle leg (ML) inside steps (P<sub>in</sub>=0.76s; SD=0.15) was significantly shorter than that of ML outside steps (P<sub>out</sub>=1.13s; SD=0.28) (p&lt;0.01, Figure <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Neither the stepping periods of the inside, nor those of the outside FLs and MLs were significantly different from one another (p<sub>in</sub> =0.43s, p<sub>out</sub>= 0.6s, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). We also looked for changes in motor output at the level of the muscle activity between the inside and outside legs. The only clear difference in the average EMG activity was observed in the most proximal leg joint, the thorax-coxa-joint, through which movements of a leg along the body axis are controlled. During inside stepping, the muscles <i>retractor coxae</i> and its antagonist, the <i>protractor coxae</i>, both served as either stance or swing muscles. Figures 1bi and bii show examples of ML <i>pro</i>- and <i>retractor coxae</i> EMG activity during inside and outside walking, and the averages of the rectified and smoothed EMG activity from 182 inside (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1ci</a>) and 204 outside steps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1cii</a>) from five animals. Interestingly, the protractor activation in this case often also overlapped with that of the retractor, which suggests co-contraction and matches sideward steps observed during inside stepping.

In contrast to the standing animal, however, no stereotypical activation of retractor activity was observed upon load stimuli (n=617). Instead, load stimuli either started or terminated retractor, and <i>vice versa,</i> protractor activity. Activation of the retractor MNs in variable strength compared to control upon load stimuli was observed in all 13 animals (16\u2013100% of the stimuli/animal), termination of retractor, and activation of protractor MNs was observed in 54% of the cases (7 out of 13 animals, 2\u201325% of the stimuli). In addition, in 10 out of 13 animals, and on average upon 18.8% of the stimuli (SD=15.2), load stimuli did neither elicit retractor nor protractor activation. This is depicted for one animal in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, including PSTH analysis of the responses to CS stimuli during standing and during inside turning sequences (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3bi\u2013iii</a>). Timing of the load stimuli with respect to the front leg steps was distributed uniformly throughout the FL step cycle. We also tested whether the strength of the retractor activation was dependent on the timing of the CS stimulus during the FL step cycle. This was not the case, as shown in the plot in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a> for the example animal shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, nor for all other animals (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We equally tested whether either activation of the protractor motor activity or the lack of a response occurred during a preferred phase of the step cycle. No phase preference was found for the activation of protractor activity during FL step cycle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). However, we found a significantly increased likelihood for failure to elicit a response to a CS stimulus at 0.89 of the FL step cycle (p=0.028) although this phenomenon could occur during all phases of the FL step cycle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). In summary, these results clearly show side-specificity in the processing of local load signals during inside curve walking, modified from that during forward and outward stepping, such that the stereotypical influence of load feedback is no longer present."

Nevertheless, the question as to the mechanism behind the differences in cycle periods of outside and inside legs upon removal of mechanical coupling remains. We therefore checked for potential differences in the activity of those local central networks that generate alternating activity in the coxal protractor and retractor motoneurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">B\u00fcschges et al., 1995</a>). To do so, we analyzed their motor output in the deafferented mesothoracic ganglion during curve walking. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> shows mesothoracic protractor and retractor MN activity during inside (a\u2013c), and outside turning (d\u2013f) of the FL ipsilateral to the recording site. When the FL performed inside steps, protractor activity in the mesothorax was increased over retractor activity in all animals (N=17), and alternating activity between the two MN pools was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). The rhythmic activity of the mesothoracic coxal motoneurons was tightly correlated and largely in phase with the steps of the ipsilateral FL, as previously described for straight walking of the FL on a treadmill (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borgmann et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4bi\u2013ii</a>). Protractor activity was strongest at about 270\u00b0 of the step cycle in the FL in about 60% of the experiments (N=17), retractor activity at about 90\u00b0 in 86% of the experiments (N=14) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4ci\u2013ii</a>).

We therefore isolated the mesothoracic ganglion in a split-bath preparation, and, after recording mesothoracic pro- and retractor activity in control conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5ai</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6ai</a>), activated the local CPGs in the mesothoracic ganglion pharmacologically through superfusion with the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine (<a href=\"#bib9\">B\u00fcschges, 1995</a>;<a href=\"#bib6\">Borgmann et al., 2009</a>). This elicited slow, alternating motor activity in the standing animal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5aii</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6aii, aiii</a>). During subsequent inside steps of the ipsilateral FL, protractor activity increased, and the pilocarpine-induced rhythm sped up significantly in all experiments from an average 0.27Hz (SD=0.1) to 1.16\u2009Hz (SD=0.36; N=11, p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>).

The success of the turning motor behavior can either be deduced from changes in the stride length (<a href=\"#bib57\">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1990</a>) or from the sideward or backward steps or strokes of the inside leg (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gruhn et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib57\">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1990</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib38\">Mu and Ritzmann, 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib46\">Rivera et al., 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib59\">Szczecinski et al., 2014</a>). In the stick insect, the ML movement on the inside is characterized by a flexion around the femur-tibia joint, reduced angle of movement in the thorax-coxa joint, and the occurrence of forward, sideward and backward steps in immediate succession. In contrast, outside MLs only show an increased front to back angle of movement, and reduced flexion in the femur tibia joint both under conditions of turning on normal substrate and during turns on the slippery surface (<a href=\"#bib19\">D\u00fcrr and Ebeling, 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib25\">Gruhn et al., 2009</a>- <a href=\"#bib26\">, 2011</a>).

However, all of the studies cited above investigated curve walking while the individual legs of the animals were mechanically coupled through the ground, and could not express their inherent cycle period. A plausible explanation for the difference to our findings and similar ones in the cockroach (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mu and Ritzmann, 2005</a>) is that we studied curve walking on a slippery surface. During walking above greased plates, the mechanical coupling between the legs, and passive influences caused by ground contact are reduced or even abolished. Therefore, turning on the slippery surface must be considered a special case, in that the traction for the legs and the resistance the legs experience is reduced. In addition, stepping is not affected by passive displacement through the movements of the other legs on the ground via the mechanical coupling. Hence, the resulting sensory feedback is altered from walking on normal ground. Interestingly, turning kinematics between slippery surface and air-cushioned ball are still remarkably similar for both cockroach and stick insect (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tryba and Ritzmann, 2000</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib25\">Gruhn et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib19\">D\u00fcrr and Ebeling, 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib59\">Szczecinski et al., 2014</a>). Because of these differences, walking on the slippery surface allows one to draw conclusions about the centrally generated motor output of the nervous system. The significantly higher stepping frequency observed on the inside compared to the outside under these conditions may therefore reflect exactly this changed output during turning which, under more naturalistic conditions, is masked and altered by sensory feedback."

Experimental data point towards two alternative ways for the neuronal control of turning, that are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

During terrestrial locomotion, however, the rigid coupling through ground contact exerts much stronger influences than mechanical coupling in fluids and locomotion involves more than trunk movement. This might explain why changes in sensory processing have been reported to form the basis of context-dependent changes in motor output in insects (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akay et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib28\">Hellekes et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib40\">Mu and Ritzmann, 2008b</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2015</a>)."

Similar context-dependent processing of sensory feedback was reported before in vertebrates and insects (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pearson and Collins, 1993</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib1\">Akay et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib28\">Hellekes et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib40\">Mu and Ritzmann, 2008b</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib40\">Mu and Ritzmann, 2008b</a>). Feedback about flexion of the stick insect tibia, signaled by the femoral chordotonal organ (fCO), leads to a reinforcement of flexion in inside legs, while no such effect is observed in outside legs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hellekes et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, feedback from ML campaniform sensilla (CS) of stick insects, elicited by a load-mimicking stimulus in the horizontal plane, like that applied in our experiments, was shown to trigger a switch from ML protractor to retractor activity during forward, and in the opposite direction during backward stepping of the FL on a treadwheel (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akay et al., 2007</a>). All these changes in sensory processing could be depending on descending commands from the brain, as lesioning the connective anterior to the prothoracic ganglion (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mu and Ritzmann, 2008b</a>) and stimulation of turn-inducing central complex (CX) neurons have been shown to alter similar reflexes elicited by stimulation of the chordotonal organ in cockroach (<a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2015</a>)."

Processing of the same stimulus on the inside was not found to be so stereotypic, ranging from activation of retractor to different degrees and termination of protractor activity, through activation of neither motor neuron pool, to protractor activation and termination of retractor activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Except for a very weak phase dependence in the failure to respond to a CS stimulus to the final fourth of the FL step cycle, all other types of response to loading stimuli were not dependent of the FL step cycle. On the outside, the response matches the functional stance movement of the outside leg in the intact animal and, similar to straight walking, load in this context supports retraction of the leg (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akay et al., 2007</a>). On the inside, the variability in the influence is in good agreement with the observations from turning intact animals, where inside ML steps show the full spectrum of movement directions from forward to backward steps both on slippery ground and under more natural conditions (<a href=\"#bib19\">D\u00fcrr and Ebeling, 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib25\">Gruhn et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib15\">Cruse et al., 2009</a>). A context-dependent influence of load feedback as part of a unilateral mechanism to generate behavioral adaptivity had been shown (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akay et al., 2007</a>). From our results, it seems clear that graded input from yet unknown origin anterior to the mesothoracic ganglion during optomotor induced curve walking of the front legs locally modifies strength and sign of this load stimulus-dependent influence. At least two possible mechanisms for the processing of load feedback are conceivable. One is presynaptic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stein and Schmitz, 1999</a>) that could modify the gain of load feedback onto the neural networks controlling the thorax-coxa joint CPG. The existence of presynaptic modulation of sensory synapses in the CNS has previously been described in a number of invertebrate and vertebrate locomotor systems (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clarac and Cattaert, 1996</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib11\">B\u00fcschges and Wolf, 1999</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib53\">Sirois et al., 2013</a>). Alternatively, the weighing of parallel pathways from the load sensors, the CS, to the premotor interneurons could be shifted and thereby either promote retractor or protractor activation, as previously shown for gain control of reflexes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Driesang and B\u00fcschges, 1996</a>) and recently implemented in a simulation model for cockroach turning (<a href=\"#bib59\">Szczecinski et al., 2014</a>)."

The difference between the two sides is that on the inside, flexion of the tibia and the inward directed movement of the leg are prioritized through strong assisting input from the fCO (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hellekes et al., 2012</a>). In this context, loading feedback is of lesser importance for determining forward or backward movement. In contrast, on the outside, processing of sensory feedback produces the opposite effect in that loading supports retraction to promote the front-aft movement of the leg."

In addition, the motor output in the deafferented mesothoracic motor control system is also modified in a side-specific manner during curve walking of the FLs: first, there is pronounced alternating activity between pro- and retractor MNs on the inside, and tonic activity on the outside. Second, there is a strong bias towards protractor activation on the inside, and towards retractor activation on the outside. Our results thus indicate that the activity of the local subcoxal CPGs is under the influence of descending input from more anterior ganglia to support the generation of curve walking kinematics (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). How can such an influence be mediated?"

The first are the networks that generate swimming in lamprey (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grillner et al., 2008</a>), and the other are the networks that generate flight in locust (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rowell, 1993</a>). In lamprey, curve swimming is presently viewed to be mediated by a unilateral increase in descending excitatory drive from the brainstem onto the segmental CPGs which leads to a bias in the contraction strength of the segmental trunk muscles, and consequently to swimming towards the side with the increased drive (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fagerstedt et al., 2001</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib23\">Grillner et al., 2008</a>). In the locust, asymmetries in wing beat amplitude, phase shifts of wing beat between the sides, bending the abdomen and ruddering with the hind legs, all form part of steering maneuvers (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rowell, 1993</a>). Especially, if the pronation angle in both wings on one side changes, turns are induced as a result of differences in lift and thrust between the two body sides (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wolf, 1990</a>). These asymmetries are created by activation of thoracic interneurons that receive input from descending interneurons about changes in body orientation. This appears to directly affect MN output on one side of the body (<a href=\"#bib44\">Reichert, 1989</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib49\">Rowell, 1993</a>). However, in contrast to lamprey and the stick insect, in the locust, local CPG activity is unaffected by this descending input (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rowell, 1993</a>)."

The existence of a descending drive from anterior to the mesothoracic ganglion to the pattern generating networks of the mesothoracic joints was shown previously in physiological experiments (<a href=\"#bib63\">Westmark et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib5\">Borgmann et al., 2007</a>), and successfully implemented in models for the stick insect (<a href=\"#bib33\">Knops et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib60\">Toth et al., 2012</a>) and also for cockroach walking and turning (<a href=\"#bib59\">Szczecinski et al. 2014</a>). In contrast to lamprey steering, however, this drive appears to affect the segmental CPGs on each side of the stick insect. Moreover, the drive to the mesothorax during turning produces particularly strong activity in the respective opposite coxal MN pools in the homologous CPGs of the two sides. The above mentioned model hypothesized, and our results suggest an independent descending drive to the two body sides, which can independently strengthen or weaken the motor outputs to single leg muscles on each side of the animal (<a href=\"#bib33\">Knops et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib60\">Toth et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib59\">Szczecinski et al., 2014</a>)."

The coupling of mesothoracic inside motor activity, clearly demonstrates a phasic interganglionic thoracic influence through the FL activity. However, this influence is not present on the outside. This suggests that higher order centers in the subesophageal and supraesophageal ganglia may play the decisive role in shaping thoracic motor activity and sensory processing. Evidence for higher order centers in the insect brain as a source of the descending drive come from studies on the central complex (CX) of the cerebral ganglion. Lesion and stimulation experiments in the cockroach have shown that this neuronal structure is necessary for proper turning (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ridgel et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2015</a>). Fruit flies with mutations in the CX, show severe deficits in turning and start/stop maneuvers (<a href=\"#bib58\">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1993</a>). By lesioning the connectives anterior to the prothoracic ganglion, in cockroach and locust, or stimulation of the CX, descending signals from the brain were also shown to be responsible for altering reflex sign or gain (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mu and Ritzmann, 2008b</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib32\">Knop et al., 2001</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2015</a>) as part of the generation of turning kinematics. The nature of the descending signals and the cellular pathways are still unknown. Assuming a similar source in the stick insect, alteration of motor activity and sensory processing in the turning stick insect could be the result of increased excitation following disinhibition on one side (<a href=\"#bib47\">Roeder, 1937</a>) or, through crossed inhibition, on the contralateral side (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gal and Libersat, 2006</a>), and direct inhibition from the cerebral ganglion (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gal and Libersat, 2006</a>). Our data allow both mechanisms to play a role in turning behavior, as both, inside and outside mesothoracic pro-/retractor CPGs show increased activity, only in opposite MN pools. Recently, a neuron class was described in <i>Drosophila</i> that seems both necessary and sufficient to drive backward walking (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bidaye et al., 2014</a>). Sustained activation of the so-called MDN neurons (two per cerebral ganglion hemisphere) allow the flies to reverse stepping direction. Their axons arborize in both hemispheres of the cerebral and subesophageal ganglia, and cross the midline to project to the contralateral thoracic ganglia. From the report, it appears that this crossing takes place in the ventral protocerebrum (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bidaye et al., 2014</a>). Unilateral activation of similar neurons in the stick insect could provide means to promote turning."

We have shown that these signals to the mesothoracic ganglion act together to produce turning kinematics by at least three mechanisms: first, task-dependent processing of local load signals, modified on the inside, and unchanged on the outside; second, a shift in the weighting of motor output to the protractor on the inside, and the retractor on the outside, via modification of mesothoracic CPG activity; and third, task-dependent influence from the ipsilateral front leg which is strong on the inside and weak on the outside. Together or separately, in full strength or gradually, these three mechanisms could provide the animal with the means to perform optomotor induced turns in all their different curvatures. Previous work suggests that the origin for the modulatory influence on mesothoracic CPG activity resides largely anterior to the prothoracic ganglion. Our results provide the first comprehensive evidence for the combined local action of different central neuronal mechanisms acting together at the level of the thoracic ganglia to drive this specific kind of behavior in a legged animal."

A copper wire (49 \u00b5m outer diameter) with its insulation removed at the tip was tied around the tibia of the monitored leg, and connected to the lock-in amplifier with an alligator clip. The electrical resistance between the cuticle and copper wire was reduced with a drop of electrode cream (Marquette Hellige, Freiburg, Germany) placed at the area of contact, allowing a 2\u20134 nA current to pass through tarsus and tibia. During stance, current flowed from the plate through tarsus and tibia into the copper wire.

Due to the low-pass filter properties of the lock-in amplifier and the gradual lift-off/touchdown of the tarsus, the signal was not exactly square. We used thresholds close to the transition point to define the timing of tarsal contact and manually checked each event. Touchdowns could be determined at a resolution of less than 1\u00a0ms. Lift-off transitions were less steep and more delayed because of delayed tearing of the lubricant from the tarsus due to capillary action and occasional upward movements of the leg during stance without complete lift-off.

By using head posture alone and not having four more legs to judge turning behavior from, we may have introduced a bias towards more easily identifiable narrow turns in our sample of the two-leg preparations. However, this has no consequence for the conclusions drawn. For the analysis of the processing of load feedback we analyzed walking sequences from N=13 animals. Data for the analysis of descending influence of two-legged walking on the motor activity of ML pro-/retractor was taken from N=14 to 17 animals depending on the muscle and the direction of the turn (numbers given in the text). For the split-bath experiments, data from N=5 animals for outside, and N=8 animals for inside turns were analyzed. The lesion experiments were performed on N=4 animals (lesion of the pro-mesothoracic connective), and CS stimulation in N=13 animals."

                                "text": "Data processing and figure preparation were performed in Spike2 (Vers. 5.05, CED) and MATLAB 7.0 (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick). In some analyses, extracellular recordings were rectified and smoothed. For EMG analysis, smoothing was performed with the Spike2 smoothing function by calculating the average value of the input data points from time t - T to t + T seconds for each sample point. T was 0.05\u00a0s in our analyses. To analyze the activity of the retractor in response to CS stimuli we first rectified and then smoothed the retractor activity with a running Gaussian average (width of 100 ms). For responses during inside steps we then determined the maximum retractor activation in a time window of 150 ms after CS stimulation and normalized these to the average maximum response during control stimulations. The resulting activation strength was then plotted against the instantaneous phase of the FL step cycle. To characterize retractor responses during outside steps we first determined the average retractor activity in a time window of 100 ms before CS stimulation and 100 ms after CS stimulation. We then subtracted the average activity after CS stimulation from the activity before CS stimulation and divided the difference by the sum of the two activities; the resulting value (also known as Michelson contrast) varied between -1 and 1. Values larger than 0 thereby indicated an increase in retractor activation after CS stimulation, values below 0 indicated a decrease. These values were plotted against the phase of the FL step cycle, defined by the start of one stance phase to the start of the next, using circular statistics (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berens, 2009</a>). In addition, we determined the instantaneous phase of FL steps during inside steps at the times when either no retractor activation occurred in response to CS stimulation or when protractor activation was observed. For the analysis of the mesothoracic motor activity during FL stepping, data were first analyzed with respect to walking leg step cycle, again defined by the start of one stance phase to the start of the next, using circular statistics (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berens, 2009</a>). Phase histograms were used to compare motor neuron activity in steps with different cycle periods. Polar plots for mesothoracic motor activity show mean vectors of activity in the step cycle for each experiment. Vectors that had significant lengths are marked with an asterisk (Rayleigh test with a value of 0.005 [<a href=\"#bib2\">Batschelet, 1981</a>]). The vector length from most experiments was highly significant due to the large number of spikes. For the overall mean vector of all experiments no test of significance was done due to the varying number of spikes and steps in the experiments. A cross-correlation between pro- and retractor MN activities was done for the complete recording time including the time between stepping sequences. Between stepping sequences, pro- and retractor MNs are tonically active (<a href=\"#bib8\">B\u00fcschges and Schmitz, 1991</a>). The cross-correlation function mirrors the episodic occurrence of the stepping sequences and, if it exists, a periodic coupling between pro- and retractor MN activities. Significance levels marked with asterisks are as follows: * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001 where applicable.

They find that the generation of turning kinematics are the combined result of unilateral commands that change the leg motor output via task-specific modifications in the processing of local sensory feedback as well as modification of the activity of local central pattern generating networks in a body-side-specific way. This work in an important model system for the study of the reflex control of terrestrial limbed locomotion has potential implication for how visually guided turning movements are controlled in terrestrial limbed vertebrates. In this system there is excellent experimental access to reflex mechanisms and to central neurons that integrate reflex inputs and participate in motor pattern generation."

I am not sure that is warranted. It could be that descending commands from higher centers are causing both prothoracic and mesothoracic changes associated with turning in tandem. That would create the correlations that are documented here, but without causation. Moreover, I think the authors need to be careful about what they mean by \"descending effects\".

This paper utilizes only data from oiled plate experiments. I think this preparation is very useful and I agree wholeheartedly with their assertion that the mechanical decoupling of the legs from each other allows them to directly assess central neural effects. I have no problem with that. However, no experimental procedure is without its own baggage and this one has plenty. The animal is slipping and the decoupling could have profound effects on motor control. As the authors point out in the Discussion, some of the differences they report relative to other papers could arise from this. The CPGs could be running at a very high rate that would be limited with a whole suite of inter-leg mechanical coupling. In the intact freely moving insect, the CPGs could be providing a switch of last resort that never actually occurs, because various sensors from various legs normally force the issue before the CPG repolarizes. This is seen nicely in leech heart where neurons on one side of the ganglion will eventually repolarize from a plateau potential but normally are driven to baseline by inhibition from its contralateral homologue long before that occurs in isolation. Moreover, the turning that the authors are reporting on represents just one of many types of turns. The switch to pulling motion that is seen in the inside leg is not always seen in freely walking turns of insects. Jindrich and Full (1999) JEB 202:1603 showed several years ago that many cockroach turns show no kinematic changes but rather result from asymmetrical ground reaction forces. That kind of turn could easily occur simply by a descending command altering the strength of lateral joint movements on one side. The point is, there are many ways that any animal can execute a turn and each could be controlled by different mechanisms."

The importance of this work lies in its analysis of the contribution of each these factors to differences in the movements of contralateral legs to produce curve walking. Previous work has shown that the inside middle legs move at a lower frequency than the outside legs in animals that are curve walking on normal substrates. In the present experiments, only the front legs contacted the ground, which was frictionless. During frictionless curve walking induced by optokinetic stimuli, the inside legs moved at a higher frequency than the outside legs. The paper describes experiments to determine how the intrinsic left and right CPGs, lateralized descending commands, and imposed load stimuli each affect the inside and outside leg motor patterns during curve walking. While this analysis is clear, its relevance to the different motor patterns seen during curve-walking on normal substrates is not made clear. As the authors discuss, \"Most studies on turning of invertebrates also reported a decrease in stepping frequency on the inside compared to the outside legs (Zolotov et al., 1975; Jander, 1985), sometimes no change in frequencies (Cruse and Saavedra, 1996)\". Under these conditions, the legs are coupled through movements of the body relative to the substrate. This coupling is absent during frictionless walking. The authors suggest that \"The higher inside stepping frequency under these (frictionless substrate) conditions may therefore reflect true centrally generated drive during turning.\" But the higher stepping may also reflect the faster movements of the leg and therefore a more frequent generation of feedback signals that promote stance/swing and swing/stance transitions. Indeed, the factors analyzed under frictionless walking may operate differently to produce the different walking patterns observed on normal substrates. The authors should show how the mechanisms at work during frictionless curve walking inform our understanding of curve walking on normal substrates."

Therefore, I do not have any objections to the scientific content of this manuscript. In general, experiments and results are clearly described and documented. Of course, additionally one really would like to see recordings from the respective connectives and whether their patterns differ on both sides and whether it would be possible to identify some of the descending neurons which would be causal for the observed effects on inside and outside legs."

We have re-analyzed the retractor response to load stimuli during inside turns to evaluate the response amplitude with respect to phase. We found that there is no correlation between the response amplitude and the phase of the FL step cycle during which the stimulus occurred. This is shown as a plot in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>. In addition, we added <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> with the data from all 13 animals.

The main finding is that inside and outside legs receive different inputs from their ipsilateral (side specific) connective which not only alters the involved central pattern generators but also the processing of local sensory feedback. Not totally unexpected from discussions and theories of previous work, it is the experimental evidence presented here, that supports this idea very convincingly. Therefore, I do not have any objections to the scientific content of this manuscript. In general, experiments and results are clearly described and documented. Of course, additionally one really would like to see recordings from the respective connectives and whether their patterns differ on both sides and whether it would be possible to identify some of the descending neurons which would be causal for the observed effects on inside and outside legs.</i>"
