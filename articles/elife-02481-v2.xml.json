Essential for disaggregation, the ClpB middle domain (MD) is a coiled-coil propeller that binds Hsp70. Although the ClpB subunit structure is known, positioning of the MD in the hexamer and its mechanism of action are unclear. We obtained electron microscopy (EM) structures of the BAP variant of ClpB that binds the protease ClpP, clearly revealing MD density on the surface of the ClpB ring. Mutant analysis and asymmetric reconstructions show that MDs adopt diverse positions in a single ClpB hexamer. Adjacent, horizontally oriented MDs form head-to-tail contacts and repress ClpB activity by preventing Hsp70 interaction. Tilting of the MD breaks this contact, allowing Hsp70 binding, and releasing the contact in adjacent subunits. Our data suggest a wavelike activation of ClpB subunits around the ring."

Essential for disaggregation, the ClpB middle domain (MD) is a coiled-coil propeller that binds Hsp70. Although the ClpB subunit structure is known, positioning of the MD in the hexamer and its mechanism of action are unclear. We obtained electron microscopy (EM) structures of the BAP variant of ClpB that binds the protease ClpP, clearly revealing MD density on the surface of the ClpB ring. Mutant analysis and asymmetric reconstructions show that MDs adopt diverse positions in a single ClpB hexamer. Adjacent, horizontally oriented MDs form head-to-tail contacts and repress ClpB activity by preventing Hsp70 interaction. Tilting of the MD breaks this contact, allowing Hsp70 binding, and releasing the contact in adjacent subunits. Our data suggest a wavelike activation of ClpB subunits around the ring."

However, when the complex switches on, the middle domains let go of each other and tilt, allowing the ring to change shape.

ClpB is composed of a N-terminal domain (ND) followed by two AAA+ domains (AAA-1 and AAA-2). An 85 \u00c5 long coil-coiled propeller, the middle domain (MD), is inserted into the small subdomain of AAA-1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2003</a>). It has two blades with mutationally sensitive sites at either end, termed motif 1 and motif 2. Cryo-EM reconstructions of <i>Tth</i>ClpB hexamers show a two-tiered molecule accounting for the AAA+ rings, but lack density for the ND. On the other hand, various cryo-EM studies of Hsp104 revealed the presence of an ND ring on top of the AAA+ ones. Although the overall shape and dimensions of the ClpB and Hsp104 hexamers are comparable in the various cryo-EM studies, there are substantial differences in the channel width (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wendler et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). Observation of narrow (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2010</a>) (15\u201330 \u00c5) vs expanded (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wendler et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">2009</a>) (30\u201380 \u00c5) cavities has led to different pseudo-atomic models of the hexamers. In one model, the AAA+ rings are compact, as in the crystal structures of other AAA+ hexamers such as p97, HslU or SV40 LTag, with the Arg-finger contacting the neighbouring subunit (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bochtler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huyton et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gai et al., 2004</a>). In the EM maps used to build this compact model there is little or no density for the MD and it was assumed to extend radially outwards from the ring (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2010</a>). In the expanded model, the AAA+ domains are more widely separated with the MD intercalated between them, preventing the canonical Arg-finger contacts (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wendler et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">2009</a>). An attempt to localize the Hsp104 MD by genetically inserting a lysozyme resulted in a cryo-EM reconstruction of this chimera with visible density for the lysozyme, but not for the MD itself (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). Since none of the existing cryo-EM structures allows an unambiguous localization of the MD, its position is still a matter of debate (<a href=\"#bib6\">Desantis and Shorter, 2012</a>)."

A direct interaction between the ClpB MD and DnaK has been shown by NMR spectroscopy and site-specific crosslinking and involves the motif 2 tip of the MD and the ATPase domain of DnaK (<a href=\"#bib47\">Seyffer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rosenzweig et al., 2013</a>). The MD acts to repress ClpB disaggregase activity, and DnaK binding relieves this repression (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oguchi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Seyffer et al., 2012</a>). Point mutations in the MD show that interactions between motif 2 and AAA-1 are critical for regulating ATPase and disaggregase activities (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haslberger et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Oguchi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Seyffer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lipinska et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the MD plays an essential role in coupling Hsp70 interaction to ATPase regulation and substrate disaggregation in ClpB/Hsp104. It is therefore important to understand its structural role in ClpB/Hsp104 hexamers and in the context of the ClpB-DnaKJ bi-chaperone machinery."

We determined the crystal structure of an ND truncation of <i>E. coli</i> ClpB (residues 159 to 858; E279A/E432A/E678A mutation; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The subunit structure is very similar to that of <i>T. thermophilus</i> ClpB (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Since none of the available crystal structure conformations fit in the EM map, domains were fitted as separate rigid bodies connected at hinge regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). For the AAA-1 ring, it was possible to build a hexamer model based on the crystal structure of hexameric ClpC (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2011</a>) (PDB code 3PXG), a homologue that also displays disaggregation activity in vitro (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schlothauer et al., 2003</a>). The resulting ClpB AAA-1 hexamer model was automatically docked into the AAA-1 layer as a rigid body (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This strategy was chosen over the fitting of a single subunit followed by hexamerisation because it is expected to provide a more accurate picture of the subunit interface, which is difficult to determine at the resolution of our EM map. However, this approach did not work for the AAA-2 layer since the ClpB AAA-2 hexamer based on the ClpC crystal structure was not compatible with the density. In this case a \u223c40\u00b0 tilt of the monomers into the plane of the ring was required to obtain the optimal fit, which resembles the pseudo-atomic model of the homologue ClpA AAA-2 ring (<a href=\"#bib9\">Effantin et al., 2010</a>). Coordinates of the <i>E. coli</i> ClpB ND (residues 1 to 148) were obtained from the PDB (1KHY). A single N domain was fitted manually, maintaining the connection to AAA-1, and then hexamerised by applying symmetry in Chimera (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>)."

The FRET pair (F\u00f6rster radius of 22 \u00c5) has a distance of 19.1 \u00c5 in the wild type model and was introduced into the tryptophan-free ClpB-W462Y/W543L variant.

In one subunit, motif 1 contacts AAA-2 of the same subunit, suggesting a route of allosteric communication between AAA-1 and AAA-2.

Although the quoted resolutions for some previous structures of ClpB and Hsp104 were better, the globular shape, flexibility and asymmetry of these hexamers reduce the reliability of orientation assignment.

This new MD arrangement is in excellent agreement with recent, extensive biochemical analysis of the MD (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oguchi et al., 2012</a>). It was proposed that the MD works as a molecular toggle switching from a repressed state in which both motif 1 and 2 ends of the propeller are protected, to an active state where motif 2 is deprotected, exposing the binding site for DnaK/Hsp70 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oguchi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Seyffer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rosenzweig et al., 2013</a>).

Therefore we generated asymmetric reconstructions of ClpB. Although the resolution of the asymmetric structures is not sufficient to support a detailed mechanistic model, these reconstructions provide the first visualization of the MD conformational flexibility that was inferred from biochemical analysis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Haslberger et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Oguchi et al., 2012</a>). The asymmetric structures show that the MD orientation varies around the ring occupying the repressed, wild type-like and hyperactive positions described by the symmetrised averages. The variable tilts of MDs observed around the ring suggest that 2 to 4 adjacent subunits are available for DnaK binding in the wild-type vs only 1 in the repressed mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). This is consistent with the estimated stoichiometry of 2\u20135 molecules of DnaK per ClpB hexamer required for activation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Seyffer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Desantis et al., 2014</a>). It also suggests that at least four subunits must have detached MDs to allow activity, perhaps through movements of the AAA+ domains, in agreement with the number of ClpX subunits that hydrolyze ATP in a coordinated manner to unfold GFP in single molecule experiments (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sen et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, we calculated an ADP binding stoichiometry of 4 for both wild type and mutants (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), which indicates that although ATP hydrolysis is strongly affected, detachment of the MD does not change the nucleotide binding."

DnaK binding to an accessible motif 2 stabilizes the MD in a tilted conformation, thereby in turn breaking the repressive contacts with MDs in neighbouring subunits. Thus, an initial encounter of DnaK will facilitate DnaK binding in the neighbouring MDs. In this model, breakage or formation of motif 1-motif 2 contacts provides a mechanistic basis for signalling DnaK binding or dissociation in a wavelike manner around the ClpB ring. (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The model predicts spatial proximity of multiple DnaK molecules, which is the case for aggregated but not soluble DnaK substrates, directing ClpB activity specifically to protein aggregates. Moreover, the activation of ClpB by DnaK binding, combined with movements of the highly mobile N domain, might act to deliver the substrate to the channel entrance, where it would be engaged for threading, unfolding and consequent extraction from the aggregate."

Side views of BAP-ClpP 2:2 complexes were manually picked using Boxer (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ludtke et al., 1999</a>) and extracted into 256 \u00d7 256 boxes. The boxed particles were band-pass filtered between 300 and 10 \u00c5 for the negative stain dataset and between 300 and 5 \u00c5 for the cryo dataset. They were then normalized to the same mean and standard deviation. Particles were initially aligned to the total sum of 10\u201320 vertically oriented particles using SPIDER (<a href=\"#bib11\">Frank et al., 1996</a>). Individual 1:1 BAP-ClpP complexes were extracted with circular masks and classified by MSA in IMAGIC-5 (<a href=\"#bib51\">van Heel et al., 1996</a>) to remove images that did not represent BAP-ClpP, yielding 17,470 particles of wild type BAP-ClpP, 12,588 of BAP-E432A-ClpP, 9436 of BAP-Y503D-ClpP and 12,568 of HAP-ClpP. The BAPtrap-ClpP cryo dataset included 4592 particles. At this stage, particles were high-pass filtered to 160 \u00c5 and initial class averages of 20\u201330 images each were obtained by MSA. All alignments of 1:1 BAP-ClpP complexes were done limiting the in-plane rotation to \u00b120\u00b0. Upon further classification, 5\u201310 good classes were used to generate a starting model by angular reconstitution (<a href=\"#bib52\">van Heel et al., 2000</a>). Alternative starting models were also created by applying sixfold symmetry to single classes and then using the resultant 3D map, generally composed of three discs corresponding to the three layers of the molecule, to generate an anchor set for Euler angle assignment. A low-resolution density map was independently created for each dataset by angular reconstitution with sixfold symmetry. Particle orientations were refined in multiple cycles of AP SHC alignment in SPIDER, MSA and angular reconstitution in IMAGIC and the resulting 3D reconstruction, filtered to 30 \u00c5, was used as an initial model for projection matching in SPIDER. By applying a rectangular mask, only the AAA+ layers were refined. After 8\u201310 cycles of projection matching, using progressively smaller angular sampling steps (4\u00b0\u20131\u00b0) and filtering the 3D to the estimated resolution at each cycle, final structures were generated of the whole complex and their resolution was estimated by Fourier shell correlation with a 0.5 correlation cutoff. Based on cross correlation coefficient, around 70\u201380% of each dataset was included in the final reconstruction."

The image analysis was performed expertly, and the authors took care not to introduce model bias or over-refine their data. This allowed a clear distinction of the M-domain and consequently provided the first structural insight into the location, adopted orientations, and the dynamics of the M-domain in the ClpB hexamer. It is shown that the M-domain position at the periphery of the hexamer affects the availability of its motif 2 for interaction with DnaK/Hsp70. Based on asymmetric reconstructions, the authors found that the M-domains around the ring of the wild-type enzyme adopt differential orientations, ranging from a horizontal position with head-to-tail contacts between neighboring M-domains to a highly tilted position that allows Hsp70 binding. M-domain-dependent activation of the ClpB ATPase thus seems to occur in a coordinated wave-like fashion, and this manuscript presents an exciting new structural framework for the correlated regulation of ATP hydrolysis and DnaK-mediated substrate delivery to the ClpB disaggregase. Furthermore, the presented EM structural work is nicely complemented by elegant in-vitro biochemical experiments that analyze the spatial separation between motifs 1 and 2 for different M-domain conformations by means of FRET and characterize the roles of these motifs in regulating ATP hydrolysis and substrate processing."

Both interactions are mediated by flexible loop structures located either at the central channel or at the bottom of the ClpB ring. Nucleotide-driven conformational changes of these mobile elements do not however necessarily reflect substantial conformational changes within the bulk of the AAA+ domains. In fact, soaking of ClpX crystals with either ATP\u03b3S, ATP or ADP led to comparable structural changes and ADP, presumably generated by residual hydrolysis, fits best the electron density of an ATP\u03b3S-soaked crystal [Glynn, SE, et al, Cell, 2009]. Notably, soaking of ClpX with nucleotides led to asymmetric binding, supporting a model in which ADP also binds asymmetrically to ClpB hexamers. Similarly, binding of either ATP, ATP\u03b3S or ADP to ClpX led to the same degree of FRET changes in an experimental setup monitoring the formation of \u201cL\u201d subunits, which show tighter interaction between the large and small subunit of the AAA domain [Stinson, BM, et al, Cell, 2013]. Together these data indicate that nucleotides, irrespective of their identity, cause similar overall structural changes in AAA+ domains."
