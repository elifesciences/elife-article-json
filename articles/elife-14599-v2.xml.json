Here we show that the <i>C. elegans</i> Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium Channel (DEG/ENaC) protein, UNC-8, is transcriptionally controlled to function as a trigger in an activity-dependent mechanism that removes synapses in remodeling GABAergic neurons. UNC-8 cation channel activity promotes disassembly of presynaptic domains in DD type GABA neurons, but not in VD class GABA neurons where <i>unc-8</i> expression is blocked by the COUP/TF transcription factor, UNC-55. We propose that the depolarizing effect of UNC-8-dependent sodium import elevates intracellular calcium in a positive feedback loop involving the voltage-gated calcium channel UNC-2 and the calcium-activated phosphatase TAX-6/calcineurin to initiate a caspase-dependent mechanism that disassembles the presynaptic apparatus. Thus, UNC-8 serves as a link between genetic and activity-dependent pathways that function together to promote the elimination of GABA synapses in remodeling neurons."

Here we show that the <i>C. elegans</i> Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium Channel (DEG/ENaC) protein, UNC-8, is transcriptionally controlled to function as a trigger in an activity-dependent mechanism that removes synapses in remodeling GABAergic neurons. UNC-8 cation channel activity promotes disassembly of presynaptic domains in DD type GABA neurons, but not in VD class GABA neurons where <i>unc-8</i> expression is blocked by the COUP/TF transcription factor, UNC-55. We propose that the depolarizing effect of UNC-8-dependent sodium import elevates intracellular calcium in a positive feedback loop involving the voltage-gated calcium channel UNC-2 and the calcium-activated phosphatase TAX-6/calcineurin to initiate a caspase-dependent mechanism that disassembles the presynaptic apparatus. Thus, UNC-8 serves as a link between genetic and activity-dependent pathways that function together to promote the elimination of GABA synapses in remodeling neurons."

UNC-8 forms part of an ion channel that allows sodium ions to enter the neuron and is selectively produced in GABA neurons that are destined for remodeling."

Sodium ions then enter the neuron through UNC-8 channels. This boosts the activity of the calcium ion channels, which further increases how many calcium ions enter the cell. Ultimately, the amount of calcium inside the neuron becomes high enough to activate an additional pathway that eliminates the synapse. This downstream pathway involves components of a cell-killing (or \u201capoptotic\u201d) mechanism that is repurposed in this case to remove the GABA release apparatus at the synapse."

Circuit refinement involves both the elimination of specific synapses and the strengthening of others. These developmental changes in brain architecture are temporally coordinated with critical periods in which neuronal wiring can be shaped by activity. The establishment of binocular vision in the mammalian brain, for example, depends on visual input during a distinct developmental period in which the circuit is uniquely sensitive to neural activity. GABA signaling regulates the onset and duration of this critical period of plasticity in the visual circuit, but the molecular mechanisms that drive synaptic remodeling in this pathway are poorly defined\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Deidda et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hensch, 1998</a>)."

For example, the calcium-sensitive phosphatase, calcineurin, antagonizes long term potentiation (LTP) through dephosphorylation of an AMPA receptor subunit that results in its endocytosis from the postsynaptic membrane (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baumg\u00e4rtel and Mansuy, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Winder et al., 1998</a>).

ENaCs are expressed in mammalian epithelial tissues, where they promote sodium reabsorption\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib55\">Wemmie et al., 2002</a>). Emerging evidence indicates that DEG/ENaCs may also influence neuronal plasticity and synaptic function\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib55\">Wemmie et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kreple et al., 2014</a>). For example, the acid-sensing DEG/ENaC protein, ASIC1a, is expressed in distinct brain regions where it promotes learning and memory\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib54\">Wemmie et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zha et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Ziemann et al., 2009</a>).

Here, we describe a DEG/ENaC protein that likely exerts a similar effect on intracellular calcium, but with the strikingly different downstream outcome of presynaptic destruction."

Dorsal D (DD) motor neurons initially form synapses with ventral muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which are later eliminated and relocated to dorsal muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Ventral D (VD) motor neurons generate ventral synapses and express the transcriptional repressor protein UNC-55, which prevents these cells from remodeling; thus both DD and VD synapses are remodeled in <i>unc-55</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Walthall and Plunkett, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhou and Walthall, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shan et al., 2005</a>). Several lines of evidence indicate that UNC-55 blocks the native DD remodeling program: (1) Ectopic expression of UNC-55 in DD neurons prevents synaptic remodeling\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib45\">Shan et al., 2005</a>); (2) Ventral VD synapses are initially established and then removed in <i>unc-55</i> mutants in a sequence that parallels the DD remodeling program (<a href=\"#bib35\">Petersen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Meng et al., 2015</a>); (3) VD neurons form ectopic but functional synapses with dorsal muscles in <i>unc-55</i> mutants\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib47\">Thompson-Peer et al., 2012</a>); (4) The transcription factor genes <i>irx-1</i> and <i>hbl-1,</i> which UNC-55 negatively-regulates, normally function in DD neurons to promote remodeling (<a href=\"#bib35\">Petersen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Thompson-Peer et al., 2012</a>). We exploited the anti-remodeling role of UNC-55 in a screen designed to detect key components of the DD remodeling program as RNAi hits that prevent the ectopic remodeling phenotype of <i>unc-55</i> mutants. This approach revealed a molecularly diverse array of genes that drive removal of GABA synapses (<a href=\"#bib35\">Petersen et al., 2011</a>). Here we demonstrate that one of these UNC-55 targets, the DEG/ENaC protein UNC-8, functions to dismantle the presynaptic apparatus in remodeling GABA neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). The necessary roles of UNC-2/VGCC and TAX-6/Calcineurin in this synapse elimination mechanism argue that intracellular calcium is involved. Our results indicate that UNC-8 promotes synapse removal downstream of TAX-6 and thus could be potentially activated by TAX-6/Calcineurin. In turn, we suggest that the depolarizing activity of UNC-8 DEG/ENaC could enhance UNC-2/VGCC function. The net positive feedback loop involving UNC-2/VGCC, TAX-6/Calcineurin and UNC-8/DEG/ENaC could elevate presynaptic calcium above a critical threshold to activate a downstream caspase-dependent pathway leading to destabilization of the presynaptic apparatus (<a href=\"#bib31\">Meng et al., 2015</a>). Thus, we propose a model in which UNC-8 triggers a synaptic removal mechanism that is regulated by the intersection of a genetic program that controls UNC-8 expression and a calcium-signaling pathway that promotes neurotransmission as well as synapse elimination."

As an independent test of this finding and to determine if <i>unc-8</i> is also expressed in DD neurons, we used a GFP reporter gene (<i>punc-8::GFP</i>) that includes a 1.6 kb genomic region upstream of the <i>unc-8</i> coding sequence\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Etchberger et al., 2007</a>). In wild-type adults, <i>punc-8::GFP</i> is expressed in DD GABAergic neurons, but shows little detectable GFP signal in VD motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>). In an <i>unc-55</i> mutant, however, <i>punc-8::GFP</i> expression was clearly visible in both DD and VD neurons. As an additional test of this model, we fused GFP to the UNC-8 C-terminus in a fosmid reporter gene that spans the <i>unc-8</i> locus to include large flanking regions. The resultant UNC-8::GFP fusion protein is functional in vivo and is expressed in DD neurons in the wild type and also in VD neurons in an <i>unc-55</i> mutant. In this case, we also detected strong UNC-8::GFP expression in adjacent ventral cord DA and DB cholinergic neurons as predicted by the selective degeneration of these cells in a mutant that encodes a constitutively active UNC-8 protein\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2013</a>).

Together, these findings establish that UNC-8 expression is correlated with the execution of a genetically controlled program that promotes remodeling of GABAergic synapses."

DD remodeling is initiated toward the end of the first larval stage (L1) and involves the relocation of ventral presynaptic components to the dorsal side (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hallam and Jin, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Petersen et al., 2011</a>). Dorsal and ventral synapses were quantified throughout the remodeling period in early stage larval animals by monitoring GFP::RAB-3 puncta. This experiment revealed that the removal of ventral DD synapses was significantly delayed in <i>unc-8</i> mutants compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This effect is unlikely due to slower overall development as the birth of post-embryonic VD neurons is unaffected in <i>unc-8</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In addition, residual ventral SNB-1::GFP puncta are visible in the DD neurons of adult <i>unc-8</i> animals, but rarely in wild type indicating that <i>unc-8</i> is required for the complete removal of ventral GABA synapses in remodeling DD neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>).

The idea that <i>unc-8</i> promotes removal of ventral presynaptic components in the DD remodeling program is consistent with our finding that expression of a GFP-tagged UNC-8 protein in GABA neurons results in UNC-8::GFP puncta that are exclusively localized to the ventral nerve cord (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>)."

This test is important because previous evidence suggests that VD remodeling in <i>unc-55</i> mutants is driven by the ectopic activation of the native DD remodeling program\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib45\">Shan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Petersen et al., 2011</a>). Expression of the GABAergic presynaptic marker SNB-1::GFP in wild-type adults shows a uniform pattern of SNB-1::GFP puncta in the ventral nerve cord that corresponds to VD synapses with ventral muscles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Hallam and Jin, 1998</a>). As previously reported, ventral SNB-1::GFP clusters are largely depleted in <i>unc-55</i> mutant animals due to ectopic VD remodeling\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib35\">Petersen et al., 2011</a>). We constructed an <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> double mutant to ask if <i>unc-8</i> is required for the removal of ventral synapses in remodeling GABA neurons. Both fluorescence intensity measurements as well as quantification of SNB-1::GFP puncta number revealed significant retention of the SNB-1::GFP signal in the ventral nerve cord of <i>unc-55;unc-8</i> mutant animals in comparison to <i>unc-55</i> alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We also performed time course experiments to confirm that the retention of ventral GABA synapses during larval development in <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> animals persists into adulthood (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Because this assay should detect ventral SNB-1::GFP puncta in both DD and VD neurons, we co-labeled these synapses with the DD-specific marker, <i>flp-13::mCherry::RAB-3</i> to identify the fraction of each GABA neuron type. This experiment revealed that approximately 40% of residual GABA synapses in <i>unc-55; unc-</i>8 animals are derived from DD neurons and the balance (~60%) from VD neurons (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Our results indicate that the wild-type <i>unc-8</i> gene is capable of promoting the removal of ventral synapses in both classes of GABA neurons thus supporting the hypothesis that the DD and VD remodeling programs utilize shared sets of active components\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib45\">Shan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Petersen et al., 2011</a>)."

To address this question, we used cell-specific RNA interference (csRNAi) to knock down <i>unc-8</i> expression in GABA neurons. <i>unc-55</i> animals expressing empty vector RNAi display a stereotypical loss of ventral GABA synapses as predicted.

For this experiment, we monitored fluorescent markers for the presynaptic density protein \u03b1-liprin/SYD-2\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Dai et al., 2006</a>) and the membrane-associated endocytic protein endophillin/UNC-57\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib44\">Schuske et al., 2003</a>). As observed for SNB-1::GFP, all the additional presynaptic proteins examined appear as distinct puncta that localize to the presynaptic membrane in wild-type and <i>unc-8</i> GABA neurons. This ventral localization is substantially reduced in <i>unc-55</i> animals. The partial recovery of fluorescent puncta in <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> animals relative to <i>unc-55</i> shows that UNC-8 promotes the elimination of ventral SNB-1::GFP, UNC-57::GFP, mCherry::RAB-3, and SYD-2::GFP puncta (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013E</a>). Because these components mark synaptic vesicles (SNB-1, RAB-3) as well as the presynaptic membrane (SYD-2, UNC-57), their removal predicts that <i>unc-8</i> could be required for dismantling the overall presynaptic apparatus. To investigate this possibility, we simultaneously imaged mCherry::RAB-3 and UNC-57::GFP to monitor the organization of the presynaptic domain in <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> animals. RAB-3 cycles on and off synaptic vesicles in a GTP/GDP-dependent manner and UNC-57/endophilin recycles between vesicles and the presynaptic membrane\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib44\">Schuske et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nonet et al., 1997</a>).

Although fewer presynaptic clusters are detected at ventral synapses in <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> mutants, residual mCherry::RAB-3 and UNC-57::GFP puncta are comparably co-localized (<i>r<sup>2</sup> </i>= 0.67 \u00b1 0.04) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>)."

We therefore considered the hypothesis that UNC-8 channel function is required for synaptic elimination. This idea is consistent with our finding that the <i>unc-8</i> mutant disrupts DD and VD synapse removal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3A</a>). As a specific test of this hypothesis, we treated <i>unc-55</i> mutant animals with Benzamil, which has previously been shown to inhibit DEG/ENaC channel activity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">Kleyman and Cragoe, 1988</a>). In this experiment, <i>unc-55</i> mutant animals were grown on media containing 3\u2009mM Benzamil (see Materials and methods). Ventral SNB-1::GFP puncta were scored in adult animals. As expected, <i>unc-55</i> animals from control plates show few ventral SNB-1::GFP puncta in GABA neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). In contrast, treatment of <i>unc-55</i> animals with Benzamil results in a significantly larger number of residual SNB-1::GFP puncta on the ventral side (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). However, Benzamil treatment of <i>unc-55;unc-8</i> animals does not induce any additional enhancement of ventral SNB-1::GFP puncta. This result argues that Benzamil antagonizes synaptic removal by specifically inhibiting UNC-8 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To confirm that Benzamil inhibits UNC-8 channel activity, we expressed the constitutively active UNC-8(G387E) protein in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes for electrophysiological analysis (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We have previously established that the UNC-8(G387E) protein shows robust sodium transport activity in an extracellular solution that is depleted of calcium and other divalent cations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Under these conditions, Benzamil strongly inhibits UNC-8(G387E) sodium transport with a K<sub>i</sub> ~ 119\u2009\u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). In the presence of extracellular calcium, Benzamil acts as a more potent inhibitor (K<sub>i</sub> = 47\u2009\u03bcM) suggesting that calcium ions enhance Benzamil binding (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). A similar effect of extracellular divalent cations on inhibitor potency was previously observed for the DEG/ENaC inhibitor Amiloride (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Treatment with Amiloride also antagonizes the removal of ventral SNB-1::GFP puncta in <i>unc-55</i> mutant neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), but does not alter ventral SNB-1::GFP puncta in either <i>unc-8</i> or <i>unc-55;unc-8</i> animals (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Taken together, these results show that Amiloride and Benzamil disrupt the\u00a0GABA neuron synaptic removal and are consistent with the idea that this effect is due to the inhibition of sodium transport by an UNC-8-containing DEG/ENaC channel (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

Because this conclusion is based on the analysis of mutants that alter neural activity throughout the <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system, we performed an experiment to ask if the\u00a0GABA neuron activity alone is sufficient to drive synaptic remodeling. This requirement predicts that optogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons should accelerate the remodeling process. To test this idea, we used a GABA neuron-specific promoter to drive channelrhodopsin (ChR2) expression in DD neurons\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2009</a>). Blue light exposure of these GABA::ChR2 transgenic animals evoked muscle relaxation with an\u00a0immediate cessation of locomotion as expected for a treatment that enhances GABA release (data not shown)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib43\">Schuske et al., 2004</a>). Synchronized populations of GABA::ChR2 animals were exposed to blue light at 0.5\u2009Hz for 13\u2009hr. DD neurons were assayed for precocious remodeling by counting the number of dorsal SNB-1::GFP puncta at the end of this period. The results of this experiment show that optogenetic activation of GABA neurons accelerates DD remodeling and that both blue light and exogenous all-<i>trans</i> retinal (ATR) are required for this effect; DD neurons that express ChR2 (GABA::ChR2) remodel earlier with significantly more dorsal puncta after 13\u2009hr of light exposure in comparison to controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This finding argues that neuronal activity in DD neurons is sufficient to drive synaptic remodeling and thus suggests that a mechanism linking neural activity and <i>unc-8</i> function could be cell autonomous to GABA neurons."

In considering potential mechanisms for this effect, we performed a genetic experiment to test the idea that elevated intracellular calcium arising from UNC-2 function could activate cytoplasmic signaling proteins that drive synapse disassembly. One of these candidate downstream effectors, the calcium/calmodulin-activated phosphatase, calcineurin, is highly expressed throughout the nervous system and has been implicated in activity-dependent mechanisms that regulate synaptic maintenance and function\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Baum\u00e4artel and Mansuy, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Winder et al., 1998</a>). Calcineurin is composed of two protein components, the catalytic subunit calcineurin A and the regulatory subunit calcineurin B. To determine if calcineurin function is required for the GABA neuron remodeling mechanism, we first tested the role of the <i>C. elegans</i> calcineurin A homolog, TAX-6 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We found that a <i>tax-6</i> loss-of-function allele impedes the removal of ventral synapses in remodeling GABA neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). To ask if <i>tax-6</i> is expressed in GABA neurons, we determined that a translational reporter gene, <i>ptax-6::TAX-6::GFP</i> is co-localized with the GABA neuron-specific marker, <i>punc-47::mCherry</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). We then used a loss-of-function allele of the calcineurin B homolog <i>cnb-1</i> to confirm the role of calcineurin in synaptic disassembly. Our results indicate that <i>cnb-1</i> function is required for the efficient removal of ventral synapses in remodeling GABA neurons. In addition, genetic ablation of <i>unc-8</i> in <i>unc-55; cnb-1</i> animals do not enhance this phenotype, which suggests that UNC-8 and calcineurin promote synapse elimination in a common pathway (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>)."

In this mechanism, the adaptor protein CED-4/Apaf1 and its downstream effector, CED-3/caspase activate the actin-severing protein gelsolin to destabilize a presynaptic F-actin network during synapse elimination\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib31\">Meng et al., 2015</a>). Because synaptic removal is activated during a discrete developmental period, a specific signal is likely required to trigger this pathway. Based on our finding that calcium signaling and UNC-8 function together to promote GABA synapse elimination and previous work that detected roles for calcium in caspase activation and gelsolin function (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pinan-Lucarre et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2011</a>), we considered the possibility that these components function in a common pathway and that calcium activates the overall mechanism. To test this idea, we first asked if the cell death gene <i>ced-4</i> is required for GABA synapse removal in <i>unc-55</i> mutants in which both DD and VD neurons remodel. A loss-of-function mutation in <i>ced-4</i> results in significant retention of ventral GABA synapses in comparison to <i>unc-55</i> mutant animals and therefore confirms that <i>ced-4</i> is necessary for the efficient removal of ventral synapses in both classes (<i>e.g.,</i> DD and VD) of remodeling GABA neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, [<a href=\"#bib31\">Meng et al., 2015</a>]). The <i>ced-4</i>-dependent effect on remodeling in <i>unc-55</i> animals is comparable to that of <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> double mutants. Furthermore, the combination of <i>ced-4</i> and <i>unc-8</i> mutants did not further enhance the restoration of ventral synapses over that of either <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> or <i>unc-55; ced-4</i> animals (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Together, these results suggest that the DEG/ENaC protein UNC-8 functions in a common pathway with <i>ced-4</i> to eliminate ventral GABA synapses. Because we have also shown that calcium and <i>unc-8</i> function in a common pathway to promote removal of GABA synapses, we propose that a rise in intracellular calcium in active GABA neurons is sufficient to trigger <i>ced-4</i>-dependent synapse elimination (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, see Discussion)."

For example, members of the ASIC (acid-sensing ion channels) class of the DEG/ENaC family proteins are activated by low pH and have been implicated in learning and memory\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib55\">Wemmie et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zha et al., 2006</a>). In one possible mechanism to explain this role, acidification of the synaptic cleft that accompanies the\u00a0neurotransmitter release is thought to trigger ASIC-mediated sodium influx. The resultant membrane depolarization is proposed to enhance postsynaptic signaling by activating local voltage gated ion channels and NMDA receptors\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib58\">Wemmie et al., 2013</a>). Presynaptic roles are also possible as suggested by studies in <i>C. elegans</i> that detected an ASIC-like channel that promotes neurotransmitter secretion in a learning and memory paradigm\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib49\">Voglis and Tavernarakis, 2008</a>). Our finding that a reconstituted UNC-8 channel is in fact inhibited by low pH, however, suggests that UNC-8 is unlikely to function as an ASIC-like protein in vivo\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). This observation is important because non-ASIC members of the DEG/ENaC family are also expressed in the brain, but their roles in synaptic function are largely unknown\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Giraldez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yamamura et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Waldmann, 1995</a>). A recent study established that the DEG/ENaC protein, pickpocket, exerts a homeostatic function that maintains neurotransmitter release at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction. In this mechanism, sodium influx arising from elevated pickpocket transcription and membrane insertion is proposed to result in local depolarization that activates a nearby voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) and consequent neurotransmitter release\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib63\">Younger et al., 2013</a>). This model is consistent with the finding that the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 VGCC channel subunit cacophony is required for synaptic homeostasis\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">M\u00fcller and Davis, 2012</a>). Our results are suggestive of a similar presynaptic role for UNC-8 of enhancing intracellular calcium influx with the important difference that UNC-8 ultimately eliminates neurotransmitter secretion by triggering destruction of the presynaptic apparatus. In addition, our findings provide a plausible explanation for the radically different outcomes of pickpocket and UNC-8 channel function."

This UNC-8 function requires its intrinsic cation channel activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) which likely involves sodium influx since electrophysiological studies of a reconstituted UNC-8 channel in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes indicate that UNC-8 preferentially transports sodium and is impermeant to calcium\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Because our evidence points to punctate UNC-8 localization within the ventral nerve cord (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), it is reasonable to predict that UNC-8-dependent sodium import would activate nearby VGCC channels\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib58\">Wemmie et al., 2013</a>). This idea is consistent with the observation that VGCC function is required for ASIC-induced elevation of intracellular calcium in hippocampal neurons\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib64\">Zha et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, our results show that synaptic removal in remodeling <i>C. elegans</i> GABA neurons is disrupted by genetic ablation of the Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channel subunit, UNC-2. As a key component of the presynaptic apparatus, UNC-2 mediates calcium influx to drive neurotransmitter release\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib39\">Richmond et al., 2001</a>). We suggest that the UNC-2-dependent rise in cytoplasmic calcium in active GABA neurons is enhanced by UNC-8 cation channel function. Moreover, because our genetic results indicate that <i>unc-2</i> and <i>unc-8</i> function in a common pathway (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), the elevation of intracellular calcium arising from this interaction could be required for efficient removal of the presynaptic apparatus in remodeling GABA neurons (see below)."

The serine-threonine phosphatase activity of calcineurin/CaN is calcium and calmodulin-dependent and has been shown to regulate neural plasticity. For example, calcineurin/CaN antagonizes LTP in a mechanism that dephosphorylates the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor to promote its removal from the postsynaptic membrane\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib61\">Winder et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Gorski et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 1998</a>). TAX-6/Calcineurin could exert a parallel role in the removal of the presynaptic apparatus in GABA neurons by activating the UNC-8 channel. Our finding that the DEG/ENaC inhibitor, Benzamil, potently blocks the accelerated remodeling phenotype of a constitutively active TAX-6 protein is consistent with this idea (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). The resultant positive feedback loop involving UNC-2, TAX-6/Calcineurin and UNC-8 should further elevate intracellular calcium (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

Notably, both CED-3 and gelsolin function in calcium-dependent pathways (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pinan-Lucarre et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2011</a>).

For example, the cyclin box-containing protein CYY-1 and cyclin-dependent kinase CDK-5 function together to promote synaptic removal and reassembly, respectively\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Park et al., 2011</a>). In previous work, we have shown that the Iroquois family homeodomain transcription factor, IRX-1, promotes synaptic removal.

The exact function of the IRX-1 pathway in synaptic disassembly is unknown, but likely involves the extraction of components that are required for GABA release since functional GABA synapses are restored to the ventral nerve cord of <i>unc-55</i> animals that are also mutant for <i>irx-1\u00a0</i>(<a href=\"#bib35\">Petersen et al., 2011</a>). In the future, it will be interesting to define the specific roles of each of these effectors in the mechanism of GABA neuron synaptic remodeling.

Oocytes were injected with 10 ng/oocyte of cRNA and incubated in OR2 solution (82.5\u2009mM NaCl, 2.5\u2009mM KCl, 1\u2009mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1\u2009mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5\u2009g/liter polyvinyl pyrolidone, and 5\u2009mM HEPES, pH 7.2, supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) and 2\u2009mM Na-pyruvate) plus 500 \u00b5M amiloride (to prevent channel hyperactivation-dependent cell death) at 20\u00b0C for 2\u20133 d before recordings. Currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage-clamp amplifier (GeneClamp 500B; Axon Instruments,\u00a0Sunnyvale,\u00a0CA) at room temperature. Electrodes (0.2\u20130.5 M\u03a9) were filled with 3\u2009M KCl, and oocytes were perfused with a physiological NaCl solution (100\u2009mM NaCl, 2\u2009mM KCl, 1\u2009mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10\u2009mM HEPES, pH 7.2) and divalent cation free plus EGTA NaCl solution (110\u2009mM NaCl, 2\u2009mM KCl, 1\u2009mM EGTA, and 10\u2009mM HEPES, pH 7.2). pH was adjusted at the indicated values using NaOH. The oocyte membrane was clamped at \u221230 mV and stepped from \u2212160 to +100 mV. Benzamil was added to the solutions from a stock of 10\u2009mM. A saturating concentration of benzamil (1mM) was added at the end of each experiment to confirm that endogenous/leak currents were similar in amplitude to non-injected oocytes within each oocyte batch. Oocytes that had larger endogenous/leak currents were not further analyzed. We used the pCLAMP suite of programs (Axon Instruments) for data acquisition and analysis. Currents were filtered at 200\u2009Hz and sampled at 1 kHz. We used OriginPro 8 (OriginLab Corporation,\u00a0Northampton,\u00a0MA) to generate graphs, K<sub>i</sub>, and for statistical analysis."

                                "text": "Young adult hermaphrodites of each strain were prepared for high-pressure freeze (HPF) fixation as described\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib40\">Rostaing et al., 2004</a>). 10\u201315 animals were loaded into a specimen chamber filled with <i>E. coli.</i> The specimens were frozen rapidly in a high-pressure freezer (Bal-Tec HPM010) at \u2212180\u00b0C and high pressure. Freeze substitution was performed on frozen samples in a Reichert AFS machine (Leica, Oberkochen, Germany) with 0.1% tannic acid and 2% OsO<sub>4</sub> in anhydrous acetone. The temperature was kept at \u221290\u00b0C for 107\u2009hr, increased at 5\u00b0C/hr to \u221220\u00b0C, and kept at -20\u00b0C for 14\u00a0hr. The temperature was then increased by 10\u00b0C/h to 20\u00b0C. Fixed specimens were embedded in Epon resin after infiltration in 50% Epon/acetone for 4\u00a0hr, 90% Epon/acetone for 18\u00a0hr, and 100% Epon for 5\u2009hr. Embedded samples were incubated for 48\u00a0hr at 65\u00b0C. All specimens were prepared in the same fixation procedure and labeled with anonymous tags so that the examiner was blinded for genotype. Ultra thin (40 nm) serial sections were cut using an Ultracut 6 (Leica) and collected on formvar- covered, carbon-coated copper grids (EMS, FCF2010-Cu). Grids were counterstained in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 4\u2009min, followed by Reynolds lead citrate for 2\u2009min. Images were obtained on a Jeol JEM-1220 (Tokyo, Japan) transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Micrographs were collected using a Gatan digital camera (Pleasanton, CA) at a magnification of 100k. Images were quantified using NIH ImageJ software. Dorsal and ventral cords were distinguished by size and morphology. GABAergic synapses were identified by previously established criteria, including position in the cord as well as the morphology of the synapse\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib60\">White et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jin et al., 1999</a>). GABAergic synapses are larger than their cholinergic motor neuron counterparts, and the active zones in these synapses form a direct, perpendicular angle with muscle arms. On the other hand, the presynaptic density in cholinergic synapses orient at an acute angle to the muscle, generally 30\u201345\u00b0 and are often dyadic. Some images were collected at 30\u00a0k to aid in identifying synaptic identity based on terminal position in the cord. Two colleagues with expertise in EM reconstruction of the <i>C. elegans</i> ventral nerve cord independently reviewed synapse images from each strain to verify identification. Each profile represents an image taken of a 40 nm section. A synapse was defined as a set of serial sections containing a presynaptic density and flanking sections from both sides without presynaptic densities. Synaptic vesicles were identified as spherical, light gray structures with an average diameter of ~30 nm. At least two animals were analyzed for each genotype. Numbers of profiles analyzed for each genotype were: wild type = 502, <i>unc-8</i> = 322, <i>unc-55</i> = 246, <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> = 304 for ventral GABAergic synapse evaluation; wild type = 502, <i>unc-8</i> = 322, <i>unc-55</i> = 246, <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> = 304 for ventral cholinergic synapse evaluation."

In particular, we have re-worded statements to the effect that \u201c<i>unc-8</i> is required for synaptic removal\u201d to say \u201c<i>unc-8</i> promotes synaptic removal.\u201d This alternative description reflects our finding that <i>unc-8</i> functions in parallel to other pathways that also promote synaptic removal. In fact, other known components of the remodeling mechanism are also not absolutely required. For example, the apoptotic pathway that removes DD synapses in young larvae is complemented by an additional unknown mechanism that eventually dismantles these connections by the adult stage (Meng et al. 2015). Together, these findings indicate that the synaptic remodeling mechanism is complex and likely involves multiple pathways. We have included the results of an additional experiment that validates the role of <i>unc-8</i> in synaptic removal. We interpret our genetic results to indicate that wild-type <i>unc-8</i> is required for the removal of a significant fraction of presynaptic domains in remodeling GABAergic neurons. To test the hypothesis that <i>unc-8</i> function is also sufficient to drive synapse removal, we have used a transgenic strategy to over-express <i>unc-8</i> in ventral cord GABAergic neurons. In this experiment, we observed that ventral synapses are substantially reduced in VD neurons that express ectopic <i>unc-8</i>, whereas neighboring VD neurons that do not express <i>unc-8</i> retain the wild-type complement of ventral presynaptic domains. This result supports the model that UNC-8 drives presynaptic removal. This experiment has been included in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>."

We performed time-course analysis in both <i>unc-55</i> and <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> animals (See <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). At early time points (12, 18, 25, and 36 hours post lay) <i>unc-55</i> and <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> animals show similar numbers of ventral synapses. At later stages (&gt; 48 hour post lay), as previously reported in Petersen et al. (2011), the number of ventral GABA synapses declines in <i>unc-55</i> mutants. In contrast, the number of ventral synapses in the <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> animals remains steady (through 96 hours post lay) and does not decline. These results are consistent with the idea that the residual ventral synapses that we detected by fluorescence and electron microscopy in <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> adults are likely to correspond to GABA synapses that are not properly removed as opposed to new synapses which might otherwise appear in this experimental approach as a spike in ventral puncta during later development of <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> animals. Additionally, it is unlikely that the GABA synapses we see by EM in the ventral nerve cords of <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> animals are due to ectopic protein trafficking, as they include organized presynaptic structures with active zones, synaptic vesicles, dense core vesicles, and juxtaposed postsynaptic muscle arms."

However, the existence of these presynaptic structures in an <i>unc-55; unc-8</i> mutant <i>whether functional or not</i> provides clear evidence that wild-type UNC-8 promotes the removal of presynaptic components including proteins that are required for neurotransmitter release (e.g., RAB-3, SNB-1/V-SNARE, UNC-57/endophilin, SYD-2/Liprin). The non-functionality of the presynaptic regions that are <i>not</i> removed in <i>unc-8</i> mutants suggests that an additional parallel pathway, which is still active in an <i>unc-8</i> mutant, must account for this deficit. At the recommendation of the reviewers (see below) who felt that our analysis of a second parallel acting remodeling pathway detracted from the main point of this work (i.e., UNC-8 promotes synaptic remodeling) these data have been removed from the paper and will be featured in a separate manuscript that documents the parallel roles of the <i>unc-8</i> and <i>irx-1</i>-dependent remodeling pathways."

We have summarized these results here and emphasized additional experiments in this paper that extend our original findings. For example, the first Results section uses an <i>unc-8</i> promoter-GFP reporter gene to confirm the prediction that <i>unc-8</i> is negatively regulated by <i>unc-55</i> in VD neurons. Next, we report experiments with a new <i>unc-8</i> deletion allele that confirm the initial RNAi results and which show, for the first time, that unc-8 also functions in DD neurons to promote synapse removal in the native GABA neuron remodeling pathway.
