Here we report structures of complexes formed by the DD of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) with RhoGDI, for activation of the RhoA pathway, with caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of RIP2 kinase, for activation of the NF-kB pathway, and with itself, revealing how DD dimerization controls access of intracellular effectors to the receptor. RIP2 CARD and RhoGDI bind to p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD at partially overlapping epitopes with over 100-fold difference in affinity, revealing the mechanism by which RIP2 recruitment displaces RhoGDI upon ligand binding. The p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD forms non-covalent, low-affinity symmetric dimers in solution. The dimer interface overlaps with RIP2 CARD but not RhoGDI binding sites, supporting a model of receptor activation triggered by separation of DDs. These structures reveal how competitive protein-protein interactions orchestrate the hierarchical activation of downstream pathways in non-catalytic receptors."

Here we report structures of complexes formed by the DD of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) with RhoGDI, for activation of the RhoA pathway, with caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of RIP2 kinase, for activation of the NF-kB pathway, and with itself, revealing how DD dimerization controls access of intracellular effectors to the receptor. RIP2 CARD and RhoGDI bind to p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD at partially overlapping epitopes with over 100-fold difference in affinity, revealing the mechanism by which RIP2 recruitment displaces RhoGDI upon ligand binding. The p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD forms non-covalent, low-affinity symmetric dimers in solution. The dimer interface overlaps with RIP2 CARD but not RhoGDI binding sites, supporting a model of receptor activation triggered by separation of DDs. These structures reveal how competitive protein-protein interactions orchestrate the hierarchical activation of downstream pathways in non-catalytic receptors."

DDs are present in a variety of proteins, including several members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) and a range of intracellular signaling components, such as caspases and kinases. The DD family includes four subfamilies of structurally related domains, including the canonical DD, the death effector domain (DED), the caspase recruitment domain (CARD), and the pyrin domain (PYD). DD-containing proteins play central roles in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling through the formation of oligomeric protein complexes, and several disease-causing mutations have been mapped to DD interfaces (<a href=\"#bib30\">Park et al., 2007</a>). All DD complexes described so far involve homotypic interactions between DDs of the same subfamily (e.g., DD with DD, CARD with CARD, etc.). All known DD interactions belong to one of three types (I to III), each mediated by conserved asymmetric interfaces in the interacting DDs (<a href=\"#bib32\">Park, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Park et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Weber and Vincenz, 2001</a>). Heterotypic complexes between DDs from different subfamilies have not yet been described and, aside from a few structures of DDs bound to small polypeptides, no complexes of DDs with proteins outside the DD superfamily have been reported. Thus, type I, II, and III interactions between DDs are thought to represent the predominant mechanism of oligomerization and complex formation for DD-containing proteins."

In addition to the neurotrophins, a number of other extracellular ligands can also engage or signal through p75<sup>NTR</sup>, including the beta-amyloid peptide (<a href=\"#bib19\">Knowles et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Perini et al., 2002</a>), the rabies virus glycoprotein (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tuffereau et al., 1998</a>), and various myelin-derived polypeptides (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wong et al., 2002</a>). p75<sup>NTR</sup> may function alone or in conjunction with other transmembrane proteins to allow ligand binding and intracellular signaling. These proteins include members of the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases, members of the Vps10p family of sorting receptors, such as Sortilin, and the Nogo receptor, which promotes binding to myelin-derived ligands (<a href=\"#bib39\">Underwood and Coulson, 2008</a>). p75<sup>NTR</sup> can engage different intracellular pathways, of which the best characterized are the RhoA pathway, which regulates axon growth, collapse and degeneration (<a href=\"#bib31\">Park et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yamashita et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</a>), the NF-kB pathway, which contributes to cell survival (<a href=\"#bib2\">Carter et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Khursigara et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Vicario et al., 2015</a>), and the c-Jun kinase (JNK) or caspase pathway, which mediates apoptotic cell death (<a href=\"#bib10\">Friedman, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yoon et al., 1998</a>). p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling through any of those three pathways requires a functional DD (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</a>). Expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> increases in a number of neurodegenerative diseases and upon injury or stress conditions, where it contributes to neuronal and glial cell damage, axonal degeneration, and synaptic dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ibanez and Simi, 2012</a>).

Disruption of this conformational change through mutation of a conserved cysteine residue in the TM domain prevents p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling in response to neurotrophins (<a href=\"#bib41\">Vilar et al., 2009</a>). p75<sup>NTR</sup> lacks an associated catalytic activity. Similar to other members of the TNFRSF, signaling by p75<sup>NTR</sup> proceeds via ligand-induced recruitment and release of cytoplasmic effectors to and from its intracellular domain. Ligand-induced separation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DDs may allow the recruitment of intracellular components for downstream signal propagation. Although a variety of intracellular proteins have been reported to interact with p75<sup>NTR</sup>, the molecular mechanisms by which the receptor engages different signaling pathways remain unclear. To begin addressing these questions, our laboratory performed a comprehensive structure\u2013function study of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD that resulted in the identification of three sets of solvent-exposed residues that are critical for p75<sup>NTR</sup>\u2019s ability to engage the RhoA, NF-kB and JNK/cell death pathways, respectively (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</a>).

Neurotrophin binding induces the release of RhoGDI from p75<sup>NTR</sup> and decreases RhoA activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gehler et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yamashita et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</a>). Using biochemical and cell-based assays, we have previously identified solvent-exposed residues in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD that are critical for its interaction with RhoGDI and RhoA activation, including residues in helices H1 and H6 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</a>). In order to obtain a molecular understanding of this interaction, we determined the solution structure of the human p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RhoGDI complex by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We note that, unless otherwise indicated, all amino acid residue numbering in this study corresponds to the human forms of the respective proteins. Human and rat p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD share more than 90% sequence identity\u2014including all functionally\u00a0relevant residues\u2014and an essentially identical three-dimensional structure with an overall RMSD of 1.7\u00a0\u00c5 ((<a href=\"#bib23\">Liepinsh, 1997</a>) and this study). The ensemble of the 10 lowest-energy conformers of the DD:RhoGDI complex and a representative structure are depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>. p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD in the complex consists of one 3<sub>10</sub>-helix followed by six \u03b1-helices and its global fold is very similar to that of our previously described structure of rat p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liepinsh, 1997</a>). In the complex, the C-terminal domain of RhoGDI primarily displays an immunoglobulin-like fold similar to previously described structures of this protein (<a href=\"#bib25\">Longenecker et al., 1999</a>). Residues Glu<sup>40</sup> to Gly<sup>57</sup> in the RhoGDI N-terminal domain fold into a long helix, which is not involved in p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD binding and remains flexible in the complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Removal of this N-terminal domain did not affect RhoGDI binding to p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Inspection of the interface in the complex showed that it is mainly formed by \u03b1-helices H1 and H6 of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and \u03b2-strands S2, S3, S9 and \u03b1-helix H2 of RhoGDI, forming a small hydrophobic core surrounded by polar residues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Charged residues play an important role in the binding interface and high concentration of salt (i.e., greater than 200\u00a0mM NaCl) can almost completely disrupt p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RhoGDI interaction in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). It is gratifying to note that all functional DD determinants that we have previously identified by site-directed mutagenesis clustered at the DD:RhoGDI interface of the complex structure (labeled red in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). The structure of the DD:RhoGDI complex offered an opportunity to address the functional importance of a larger set of residues in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD as well as in RhoGDI. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in cells transfected with constructs of full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> and RhoGDI carrying different point mutations in selected residues. Alanine substitution of individual amino acid residues likely uncovers only those side chains making the most critical contribution to the binding interface. In the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD, substitution of either Asp<sup>412</sup>, Lys<sup>343</sup> or Glu<sup>420</sup> was found to significantly diminish interaction with RhoGDI (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In RhoGDI, substitution of Lys<sup>99</sup> or Lys<sup>199</sup> abolished its interaction with p75<sup>NTR</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In agreement with this, the structure of the complex shows that these two positively charged side chains make charge interactions with Glu<sup>420</sup> and Asp<sup>412</sup>, respectively, in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

                                "text": "Analysis of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RhoGDI complex and a previously described crystal structure of the RhoGDI:RhoA(GDP) complex (<a href=\"#bib25\">Longenecker et al., 1999</a>) indicated that p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and RhoA interact with different surfaces in RhoGDI, located at opposite sides of the molecule. The two distant binding sites on RhoGDI suggested that a heterotrimer complex p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RhoGDI:RhoA may be structurally feasible. We investigated this by performing HADDOCK calculations (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dominguez et al., 2003</a>) using our solution structure of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD from its complex with RhoGDI and the crystal structure of the RhoGDI:RhoA(GDP) complex. Multiple refinements converged to a mean backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.64 \u00b1 0.05\u00a0\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Ramachandran plot analysis of the docking model indicated that the trimer structure, including the two intermolecular interfaces, still occupies the energetically preferred conformation. In the tripartite complex, the N-terminal domain of RhoGDI folded into two helices and bound to RhoA(GDP), similar to its conformation in the RhoGDI:RhoA(GDP) complex (<a href=\"#bib25\">Longenecker et al., 1999</a>). The DD binding site on RhoGDI remained nearly identical to that in the DD:RhoGDI complex. This analysis shows that interaction of the three proteins can indeed occur simultaneously and explains previous biochemical studies showing that RhoA can be co-immunoprecipitated with p75<sup>NTR</sup> in the presence of RhoGDI (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yamashita et al., 1999</a>). Using the purified proteins, we determined the binding affinity of the RhoGDI:RhoA complex by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Titration of RhoGDI onto immobilized RhoA, yielded a binding <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 0.14 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcM, which is in agreement with previous measurements (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tnimov et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Interestingly, when RhoGDI was precomplexed with purified p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD, the <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> was 2.2 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), indicating that binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD decreases the affinity of the RhoGDI:RhoA interaction by about 15-fold. We note that, in the absence of RhoGDI, no binding between p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and RhoA could be detected in these experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These results suggest that RhoGDI binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD weakens its interaction with RhoA, a step which may facilitate RhoA activation."

                                "text": "NGF binding to p75<sup>NTR</sup> elicits the recruitment of RIP2 kinase to the receptor. Recruitment of RIP2 is required for regulation of the NF-kB pathway by p75<sup>NTR</sup>. Previous biochemical studies established that the interaction between p75<sup>NTR</sup> and RIP2 is mediated by their DD and CARD domains, respectively (<a href=\"#bib18\">Khursigara et al., 2001</a>). The RIP2 CARD consists of 107 amino acids and is located in the C-terminal of the protein. It connects to the N-terminal kinase domain via a linker of 120 amino acids. We determined the NMR structure of human RIP2 CARD in monomeric form (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The solution structure of RIP2 CARD comprises an arrangement of six \u03b1-helices followed by one short 3<sub>10</sub>-helix, all tightly packed around a hydrophobic core. A C-terminal tail of 17 amino acids (Leu<sup>524</sup>-Met<sup>540</sup>) follows the CARD and is unstructured and flexible in solution. A unique segment (Gln<sup>518</sup>-Ile<sup>523</sup>) between the C-terminal tail and the 3<sub>10</sub>-helix contains two structural disruptor residues (i.e., Pro<sup>519</sup> and Pro<sup>520</sup>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and lacks a secondary structure, but its orientation was well-defined in the NMR structure. A number of hydrophobic residues (e.g., Ile<sup>523</sup>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) in this segment closely interact with the first and the last \u03b1-helices in the RIP2 CARD. Structural comparison using the DALI server (<a href=\"#bib14\">Holm and Rosenstr\u00f6m, 2010</a>) showed that the most similar structure to RIP2 CARD was the CARD of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1), with a <i>Z</i>-score between 9 and 11. NOD1 and RIP2 have been shown to interact with each other through their CARDs to propagate immune signaling (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mayle et al., 2014</a>). The two CARDs share similar structural features, including a similar arrangement of all but the last of the \u03b1-helices, which displays different local secondary structures in the two proteins (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Despite their folding similarities, the two CARDs exhibit significantly different surface characteristics. Particularly, RIP2 CARD has many more charged residues on its surface than its NOD1 counterpart (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Different electrostatic surfaces will confer different interaction specificities, a common feature among members of the DD superfamily, including the CARD subfamily."

The core helical structure of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RIP2 CARD complex was similar to that in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RhoGDI complex, with a pairwise RMSD of ~1.9 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). The orientation of \u03b1-helices H3 and H6 changed by approximately 7\u00b0\u20138\u00b0. Similarly, pairwise RMSD between RIP2 CARD in monomeric form and in complex with the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD was ~1.5 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The main interface in the core structure of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RIP2 CARD complex involved \u03b1-helices H2, H3, H5, H6, and H5\u2013H6 loop of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and \u03b1-helices H1, H3\u2013H4, and H5\u2013H6 loops of RIP2 CARD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions contribute to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RIP2 CARD interface. Interestingly, the C-terminal tail of RIP2 CARD was better defined in its complex with the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD compared to its monomeric form, although the last six amino acids still remained flexible. The C-terminal tail bound to \u03b1-helices H1, H5, and H6 of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD, through both hydrophobic and charged interactions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). In our previous site-directed mutagenesis studies of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD, we had identified residues in helices H2 (Asp<sup>357</sup>, His<sup>361</sup>, and Glu<sup>365</sup>), H3 (Gln<sup>369</sup> and Glu<sup>371</sup>), H5 (Asp<sup>399</sup>), and H6 (Asp<sup>412</sup> and Glu<sup>415</sup>) as being critical for its interaction with RIP2 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</a>). We were pleased to note that all these residues mapped to the DD:CARD binding interface defined in our NMR structure of the complex (labeled red in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). The NMR structure of the DD:CARD complex offered an opportunity to address the functional importance of residues in the RIP2 CARD. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in cells transfected with constructs of full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> and RIP2, the latter carrying different point mutations in selected residues of the CARD. We found that individual substitution of interface residues Gln<sup>437</sup>, Asp<sup>467</sup>, Lys<sup>471</sup>, Ile<sup>496</sup>, Glu<sup>500</sup>, or Arg<sup>528</sup>, significantly diminished RIP2 interaction with p75<sup>NTR</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>)."

This is in agreement with our previous biochemical studies that identified overlapping epitopes required for the interaction of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD with both RIP2 and RhoGDI (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</a>). In order to better understand the hierarchical relationship of these interactions, we determined the binding affinities of the DD:RhoGDI and DD:CARD complexes by SPR. The <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of RhoGDI binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD was 0.82 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM, while the <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of CARD binding to the DD was 4.67 \u00b1 0.7 nM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), indicating that RIP2 CARD binds with approximately 177-fold higher affinity than RhoGDI to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD. This is in line with the larger buried solvent accessible area in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RIP2 CARD complex (~1400 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>) compared to that in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RhoGDI complex (~900 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>). Kinetic analyses revealed that CARD associates with the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD with faster on-rate, and dissociates with slower off-rate, than RhoGDI (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). The RIP2 CARD could still fold into a typical \u03b1-helical structure after deletion of the C-terminal tail (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). However, the binding affinity of this construct to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD was 58.7 \u00b1 8.8 nM, that is, approximately 12-fold lower than with the C-terminal tail (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>), indicating a significant contribution of the C-terminal tail to the association of RIP2 with p75<sup>NTR</sup>."

These data demonstrate that RhoGDI and RIP2 CARD compete for binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and that RIP2 CARD can displace RhoGDI from the receptor. In order to test the functional significance of the antagonism between RIP2 and RhoGDI, we assessed the levels of RhoA-GTP, a measure of RhoA activation, in cells transfected with a p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression construct in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of a RIP2 construct (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). While expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> increased RhoA-GTP levels in transfected cells, coexpression of RIP2 decreased RhoA-GTP levels in a concentration-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), in agreement with an inhibitory role of RIP2 in p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated activation of the RhoA pathway. In line with this, we found elevated levels of RhoA-GTP in brain extracts from <i>Rip2</i> knockout mice compared to wild type littermates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), suggesting that RIP2 can also restrict the activation of the RhoA pathway in vivo."

Purified rat p75NTR DD has been shown to exist in either monomeric form or equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms depending on pH and counterion (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vilar et al., 2014</a>). However, the complete assignment of the DD homodimer was not reported in that study. We also found that human p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD exists mainly in monomeric form in TRIS or HEPES buffer at pH 6.0\u20137.0, which were the buffer conditions used for structure determination of DD:RhoGDI and DD:CARD complexes. In phosphate buffer, however, we observed a new form of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD as revealed by the appearance of a new set of cross peaks in the [<sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N] HSQC spectrum (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). The set of cross peaks corresponding to monomeric DD was still visible, with nearly identical chemical shift but weaker intensity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), suggesting the coexistence of dimeric and monomeric DDs under these conditions. Dynamic lighter scattering (DLS) also indicated the formation of dimeric p75<sup>NTR</sup> DDs in the presence of phosphate ions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). EGFP-tagged p75<sup>NTR</sup> DDs showed anisotropic changes due to homodimerization at different DD concentrations.

A short C-terminal tail of 7 amino acids (Ser<sup>421</sup>-Val<sup>427</sup>) in each monomer remained disordered, similar to the DD:RhoGDI and DD:CARD complexes. The helical bundle, including the 3<sub>10</sub> helix, did not undergo significant structural change with an RMSD lower than 1.5\u00a0\u00c5 compared to the other complexes.

This is in agreement with the constitutive interaction of RhoGDI with the closed conformation of the receptor. On the other hand, the DD homodimer partially occluded the RIP2 CARD interaction surface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), indicating that interaction of RIP2 with p75<sup>NTR</sup> requires dissociation of the\u00a0DD homodimer. We investigated whether the recruitment of RIP2 contributes to the separation of DDs triggered after neurotrophin binding to the receptor. This was done by taking real-time homo-FRET anisotropy measurements of DD:DD interaction in response to NGF in cells transfected with EGFP-tagged constructs of full length wild type p75<sup>NTR</sup> and a DD mutant deficient in RIP2 binding (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</a>) as previously described (<a href=\"#bib41\">Vilar et al., 2009</a>). Application of NGF to cells expressing wild type p75<sup>NTR</sup> produced large oscillations of increased anisotropy at the cell membrane (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), resulting in a positive net change averaged over a 15-min treatment compared to vehicle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). As anisotropy is inversely related to FRET, this behavior indicates ligand-triggered separation of receptor intracellular domains, as proposed earlier (<a href=\"#bib41\">Vilar et al., 2009</a>). We note that the oscillations observed here are unlikely to represent the synchronous behavior of ensembles of receptors, as their average period (2\u20133 min) would seem too slow to reflect real molecular dynamics. Importantly, the p75<sup>NTR</sup> construct carrying mutations in the CARD binding site (CBS mutant) produced very similar anisotropy changes after NGF treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>), indicating that recruitment of RIP2 is not required for DD separation in response to ligand binding to p75<sup>NTR</sup>. Finally, we note that the DD homodimer interface also overlapped with several residues involved in neurotrophin-mediated activation of JNK, caspase-3 and the apoptosis pathway (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) as identified in our previous studies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</a>). Thus, while the structure and biochemical properties of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer support the ligand-independent interaction of RhoGDI with the receptor, they also demonstrate that dissociation of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer is required for recruitment of RIP2 and for activation of the JNK/caspase-3 pathway in response to neurotrophins."

                                "text": "The main paradigm in signal transduction by DD-containing proteins is oligomerization via homotypic DD interactions. Although p75<sup>NTR</sup> contains a DD, which is required for downstream signaling, no intracellular p75<sup>NTR</sup> effectors containing canonical DDs have been identified. The study of DD signaling in p75<sup>NTR</sup> therefore addresses an unexplored dimension of the repertoire of interactions and activities in the DD superfamily. Homotypic interactions between DDs have been classified as type I, II, and III according to the interfaces involved (<a href=\"#bib32\">Park, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Park et al., 2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Weber and Vincenz, 2001</a>). Despite what might have been expected of homotypic interactions, all known interactions in the DD superfamily are asymmetric, that is, the interaction is mediated by different interfaces in each of the two interacting domains (e.g., Ia and Ib for type I). Remarkably, none of the binding surfaces in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (or in RIP2 CARD) identified in this study show a close match to any of the six conserved surfaces that characterize classical type I, II, and III interactions in the DD superfamily. The p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD surface that binds RhoGDI is formed by residues in helices H1 and H6. A previous study had proposed helix 5 as a binding site to RhoGDI based on serial deletion analysis of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</a>). This conclusion is not supported by our solution structure of the DD:RhoGDI complex, in which H5 appears at the opposite side of the interface (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), nor by previous structure\u2013function studies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</a>). This discrepancy highlights some of the pitfalls in serial deletion studies that disregard the three-dimensional structures of proteins. The surface in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD that interacts with the CARD of RIP2 includes residues in helices H2, H3, and H6 plus residues in the H5\u2013H6 loop. On the other side of this interaction, residues in helix H1 as well as the H3\u2013H4 and H5\u2013H6 loops form the binding surface on the CARD of RIP2. To the best of our knowledge, this p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RIP2 CARD complex represents the first structural characterization of an heterotypic interaction in the DD superfamily. Our solution structure of this complex also revealed an additional interaction between residues in the C-terminal half of helix H5 of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and the C-terminal tail of RIP2, which extends beyond the RIP2 CARD. This additional contact confers approximately fivefold increased binding affinity between the two proteins. Finally, the interface that mediates the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer involves residues located in helix H3 as well as the H1\u2013H2 and H3\u2013H4 loops. This surface is similar, but not identical, to the type IIIb surface, like the one identified in the DD of PIDD for interaction with RAIDD (<a href=\"#bib30\">Park et al., 2007b</a>). Unlike the classical type IIIb surface, however, the DD:DD interaction in p75<sup>NTR</sup> makes extensive use of residues in the H3 helix, and the same surface in the two interacting DDs is used to form a symmetric dimer. Further studies will be required to determine whether the interactions identified here for the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD are exceptions or else represent new types of interactions that are yet to be identified in other DD-containing proteins."

The p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD dimer interface is in agreement with sites of interaction with downstream effectors identified by the structures reported here and in our previous site-directed mutagenesis studies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD dimer structure is also in accordance with a recent mutagenesis study that identified residues important for dimerization of rat p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vilar et al., 2014</a>), many of which are also implicated in our structure. On the other hand, our results do not support two crystallographic structures reported for the rat p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer that suggested this to be either a covalent symmetric dimer, held by a disulfide bond between Cys<sup>379</sup> residues, or a noncovalent asymmetric dimer (<a href=\"#bib35\">Qu et al., 2013</a>). None of the currently available evidence derived from structural, mutagenesis, or functional studies appears to support those crystal structures. Nevertheless, we cannot at present rule out the possibility that p75<sup>NTR</sup> DDs may under certain circumstances form alternative oligomeric complexes through different interfaces. A recent study has suggested that p75<sup>NTR</sup> can form trimers in transfected cells based on the apparent molecular weights of p75<sup>NTR</sup> species in SDS/PAGE (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anastasia et al., 2015</a>). Our NMR studies of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD do not support such conclusion as we have not found any evidence for the existence of DD trimers in any of the conditions tested. Another recent study has used solution NMR spectroscopy to investigate the mobility of the transmembrane and intracellular domains of p75<sup>NTR</sup> incorporated into lipid\u2013protein nanodisks (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mineev et al., 2015</a>). These authors found a high level of flexibility in the juxtamembrane domain of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, an observation that we also reported in our earlier NMR studies of this domain (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liepinsh, 1997</a>), but they could not detect self-association of intracellular domains. However, it is unclear whether the lipid detergent used to form the lipid\u2013protein nanodisks interacted with the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and prevented its dimerization. A few detergent molecules, too few to affect DD rotational correlation time, would be sufficient to hinder DD:DD interactions."

As neurotrophins induce the release of RhoGDI and the recruitment of RIP2, we have speculated that RIP2 may displace RhoGDI from binding sites in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</a>). Our solution structures of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD in complex with RhoGDI and the RIP2 CARD lend experimental support to this notion by showing how steric clashes between the two effector proteins preclude their simultaneous binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD. SPR experiments indicated that RIP2 CARD binds with over 100-fold higher affinity to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD than RhoGDI, and 2D-NMR competition studies demonstrated that RIP2 CARD can in fact displace RhoGDI from the receptor. The functional significance of this relationship was evidenced by the ability of RIP2 to decrease p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated RhoA activation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the enhanced activation of the RhoA pathway observed in brain extracts of <i>Rip2</i> knockout mice suggests that RIP2 may also restrict activation of this pathway in vivo. These results demonstrate how a hierarchy of binding affinities dictates the differential interaction of downstream effectors with p75<sup>NTR</sup> and ultimately controls the logic of p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling."

This model has led to the idea that the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and RhoA may compete for binding to RhoGDI. On the other hand, biochemical experiments have shown that RhoA can associate with p75<sup>NTR</sup> through RhoGDI and the three proteins can be recovered together in co-immunoprecipitation assays (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yamashita et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</a>), a result that would be incompatible with the displacement concept. Our structural studies show that the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and RhoA bind on opposites sides of the RhoGDI molecule, allowing the formation of a tripartite DD:RhoGDI:RhoA complex. Using a model of this complex and our solution structure of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer, we have constructed a model of the hexameric complex of these proteins (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This model retains the two\u00a0fold symmetry of the DD homodimer, and accommodates all six components without any steric clashes. How can these interactions lead to RhoA activation? Our SPR experiments showed that association of RhoGDI with the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD reduced its affinity for RhoA by 15-fold. Close comparison of RhoGDI structures in the complexes with either p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD or RhoA revealed local structural perturbations in RhoGDI (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting a potential allosteric mechanism underlying the release and activation of RhoA upon RhoGDI biding to the receptor. Based on the present studies, we propose a model for the early stages of p75<sup>NTR</sup> engagement with the RhoGDI/RhoA and RIP2/NF-kB pathways based on differential binding affinities and competitive protein\u2013protein interactions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). At the plasma membrane, the p75<sup>NTR</sup> forms a dimer held together by interactions between its DD and TM domains (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Recruitment of the RhoGDI:RhoA complex brings RhoA close to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). RhoGDI binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD weakens its interaction with RhoA, a lipid-modified protein, allowing it to equilibrate with the plasma membrane where it can be activated by membrane-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Garcia-Mata et al., 2011</a>). RhoA may thus be in equilibrium between the cell membrane and the RhoGDI:p75<sup>NTR</sup> complex, and the action of GEFs and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) may further contribute to the dynamics of this exchange (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Upon dissociation from p75<sup>NTR</sup>, for example, as a consequence of RIP2 recruitment in response to NGF binding, RhoGDI regains high affinity for RhoA, extracting it from the membrane and holding it back in the cytosol in an inactive state (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). This new view of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD in the activation of RhoA is in better agreement with the emerging role of RhoGDI as a general facilitator of small GTPase activity cycles. Recruitment of RIP2 to p75<sup>NTR</sup> ultimately leads to increased NF-kB activity by as yet unknown mechanisms. Another p75<sup>NTR</sup> interactor, TRAF6, is also a known regulator of the NF-kB pathway (<a href=\"#bib17\">Khursigara et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ye et al., 1999</a>). As TRAF6 has been shown to interact with the juxtamembrane region of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, but not with the DD, RIP2 and TRAF6 may be able to bind simultaneously to the receptor and together contribute to enhance NF-kB activity in response to neurotrophins."

They represent new ways by which DDs regulate intracellular signaling. NMR, biochemical, and functional studies defined competitive interactions between RhoGDI and RIP2 CARD and between RIP2 CARD and the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer. These interactions give us unique insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying p75<sup>NTR</sup> activation and signaling, and reveal how overlapping interfaces and differential binding affinities cooperate to orchestrate the hierarchical activation of downstream pathways in noncatalytic receptors."

Each recombinant protein contains 16 additional residues (MHHHHHHSSGLVPRGS) at the N-terminal, including one 6\u00d7His tag. Unlabeled proteins were expressed in <i>E.\u00a0coli</i> strain SoluBL21 (DE3) in LB or M9 medium. Protein samples were purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, FPLC gel filtration (Superdex 75), and/or ionic exchange (MonoQ or MonoS). Isotopic labeling was carried out by expressing the proteins in M9 minimal medium containing <sup>15</sup>N-NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and/or <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose as the sole source of nitrogen and carbon. Protein complexes were prepared by mixing individual purified domains. Due to the weak binding affinities of DD:RhoGDI and DD homodimer complexes, as well as solubility problems of the DD:CARD complex in salt-containing buffers, gel filtration chromatography could not be used to purify these protein complexes.

The structures are consistent with this lab's prior mutational work identifying residues that are important for these binding interactions, and are combined with biophysical and cellular studies to propose a model for p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling. Taken together with prior work from this lab, the present study offers, for the first time, a detailed and compelling model for p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling. There is substantial additional novelty in the characterization of heterotypic complexes of death domains of different families."

This is because the two proteins have lysine residues at or near the interaction interfaces involved in their complexes as revealed by the structural studies. Given that the coupling to CM5 sensor chips would largely occur via surface exposed lysine residues, any ensuing SPR data generated using such an approach is inherently unreliable as partial steric obstruction of available binding sites would compromise the kinetics and affinities of the interaction under study."

The Methods section implies, although it does not explicitly state, that recombinant p75<sup>NTR</sup>-DD and RhoA were produced as His-tagged proteins. If that is indeed the case immobilization approaches described in Wear and Wilkinshaw Analytical Biochemistry 371 (2007) 250-252 might provide a convenient alternative for at least repeating some key measurements. Otherwise, isothermal titration calorimetry might provide yet another tool for generating the necessary orthogonal information on affinities, at least for the strongest interactions in the study. Another approach, albeit experimentally more laborious, would be to produce N- or C-terminally biotinylated versions of the proteins of interest and use streptavidin biosensor chips to immobilize the proteins for SPR measurements."

The strategy to immobilize p75<sup>NTR</sup>-DD and RhoA via amine coupling onto CM5 sensor chips for the binding studies via SPR introduces uncertainties about the reliability of the data obtained and the ensuing comparison of affinities. This is because the two proteins have lysine residues at or near the interaction interfaces involved in their complexes as revealed by the structural studies. Given that the coupling to CM5 sensor chips would largely occur via surface exposed lysine residues, any ensuing SPR data generated using such an approach is inherently unreliable as partial steric obstruction of available binding sites would compromise the kinetics and affinities of the interaction under study. The authors appear to possess the necessary tools for readdressing their binding studies, given that they produced the relevant proteins for NMR studies. The Methods section implies, although it does not explicitly state, that recombinant p75<sup>NTR</sup>-DD and RhoA were produced as His-tagged proteins. If that is indeed the case immobilization approaches described in Wear and Wilkinshaw Analytical Biochemistry 371 (2007) 250-252 might provide a convenient alternative for at least repeating some key measurements. Otherwise, isothermal titration calorimetry might provide yet another tool for generating the necessary orthogonal information on affinities, at least for the strongest interactions in the study. Another approach, albeit experimentally more laborious, would be to produce N- or C-terminally biotinylated versions of the proteins of interest and use streptavidin biosensor chips to immobilize the proteins for SPR measurements.</i> "

The revised Kd for interaction of RIP2-CARD to p75<sup>NTR</sup>-DD is 1.69-fold lower than the previous one. This indicates that RIP2-CARD binds with approximately 177-fold higher affinity than RhoGDI to the p75<sub>NTR</sub> DD, result that is very similar to (in fact even larger difference than) the one reported previously using CM5 chips. These results fully support (in fact, strengthen) our mechanistic conclusions concerning competition between these two interactors for p75<sup>NTR</sup>-DD binding."

RhoA-GDP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> is therefore more suitable for binding studies with RhoGDI protein. In cells, a stable cytosolic pool of GDP-loaded RhoA (inactive form) is largely maintained (or chaperoned) by RhoGDI. In response to specific signals, release from RhoGDI and insertion in the membrane leads to RhoA activation (GTP-loading). Deactivation by GAPs allows GDP-loaded RhoA to be extracted from the membrane by RhoGDI, thus resetting the cycle."
