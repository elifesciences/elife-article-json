                    "text": "Transcranial electric stimulation aims to stimulate the brain by applying weak electrical currents at the scalp. However, the magnitude and spatial distribution of electric fields in the human brain are unknown. We measured electric potentials intracranially in ten epilepsy patients and estimated electric fields across the entire brain by leveraging calibrated current-flow models. When stimulating at 2 mA, cortical electric fields reach 0.4 V/m, the lower limit of effectiveness in animal studies. When individual whole-head anatomy is considered, the predicted electric field magnitudes correlate with the recorded values in cortical (<i>r</i> = 0.89) and depth (<i>r</i> = 0.84) electrodes. Accurate models require adjustment of tissue conductivity values reported in the literature, but accuracy is not improved when incorporating white matter anisotropy or different skull compartments. This is the first study to validate and calibrate current-flow models with <i>in vivo</i> intracranial recordings in humans, providing a solid foundation to target stimulation and interpret clinical trials."

                    "text": "Transcranial electric stimulation aims to stimulate the brain by applying weak electrical currents at the scalp. However, the magnitude and spatial distribution of electric fields in the human brain are unknown. We measured electric potentials intracranially in ten epilepsy patients and estimated electric fields across the entire brain by leveraging calibrated current-flow models. When stimulating at 2 mA, cortical electric fields reach 0.4 V/m, the lower limit of effectiveness in animal studies. When individual whole-head anatomy is considered, the predicted electric field magnitudes correlate with the recorded values in cortical (<i>r</i> = 0.89) and depth (<i>r</i> = 0.84) electrodes. Accurate models require adjustment of tissue conductivity values reported in the literature, but accuracy is not improved when incorporating white matter anisotropy or different skull compartments. This is the first study to validate and calibrate current-flow models with <i>in vivo</i> intracranial recordings in humans, providing a solid foundation to target stimulation and interpret clinical trials."

Because of their simplicity, flexibility and safety profile, these techniques have been investigated in over 70 neuropsychiatric conditions, including major depression (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bikson et al., 2008</a>), epilepsy (<a href=\"#bib41\">Fregni et al., 2006d</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Auvichayapat et al., 2013</a>), tinnitus (<a href=\"#bib36\">Frank et al., 2012</a>), Parkinson\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib39\">Fregni et al., 2006b</a>), pain control (<a href=\"#bib38\">Fregni et al., 2006a</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2006c</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2007</a>), and stroke rehabilitation (<a href=\"#bib103\">Schlaug et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Baker et al., 2010</a>) among others.

Computational models of current flow have called this simplistic approach into question (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bikson et al., 2010</a>). These models capture anatomical details obtained with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict electric fields inside the brain. Models have shown that the polarity of stimulation is necessarily mixed due to cortical folding. Furthermore, nearby electrodes result in maximal electric fields between the two stimulation electrodes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Datta et al., 2009</a>), and not underneath the electrodes as commonly assumed. Detailed computational models also suggest that more focused stimulation (1 cm radius) of the cortex may be achieved by using multiple smaller electrodes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Datta et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Dmochowski et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Edwards et al., 2013</a>).

This is of particular concern given that the present estimates (of at most 1 V/m) are at the lower end of what is required to affect neuronal activity in animal experiments (<a href=\"#bib93\">Reato et al., 2013</a>). There is also no certainty as to whether the spatial distribution of electric field intensities across the brain is sufficiently well predicted to warrant model-based targeting. Here we aim to address these questions with <i>in vivo</i> intracranial recordings in humans by directly measuring field intensities produced by TES at the cortical surface and deeper brain areas. We report results on ten (10) patients undergoing invasive monitoring for epilepsy surgery, with subdural grids, strips, and depth electrodes. In total we recorded from 1380 intracranial electrodes. These recordings are then compared to various detailed computational models, including differential conductivity between skull spongiosa and compacta, and white matter anisotropy. In doing so, we obtain calibrated models that conclusively answer outstanding questions about stimulation magnitudes, spatial distribution, and modeling choices. For instance, we find that maximal electric field magnitudes are approximately 0.4 V/m when using the generally accepted maximum of 2 mA scalp stimulation. These low field intensities are below the levels typically used in animal studies providing a challenge to future studies on the mechanisms of action of TES. To facilitate validation of new modeling approaches we have made all relevant measurement data publicly available (at <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K0XW4GQ1\">http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K0XW4GQ1</a>)."

We first confirmed that measured voltages increased linearly with current intensity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; up to saturation levels of the clinical amplifiers). A modest drop in magnitude was observed with increasing frequency (25% at 100 Hz; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), which we ascribe to a non-uniform gain across frequencies for the measurement equipment and electrodes as confirmed with recording of voltages in saline. Thus, we observed uniform gain for the tissue indicating purely resistive medium in this frequency range. Repeated measurements with fixed frequency but minutes of separation indicate the level of stability of recordings over time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The observed drift in voltage magnitudes over time could have a number of sources (<a href=\"#bib78\">Noury et al., 2016</a>), most likely patient movement.

These electrodes do not necessarily capture electric field magnitudes at the locations with maximal stimulation intensities, nor will they be oriented to best capture the electric field in the orientation of the field vectors. To estimate electric field magnitude and orientation across the brain we built for each subject a realistic anatomical model of conductivity in the head (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and calibrated the model by matching measurements with the predicted electric fields (see 'Conductivity optimization'). Recorded voltages and their distribution across the cortical surface are shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A/B</a> for the recorded data and the calibrated, realistic head models. Animated 3D rendering of these images (A-C) are provided as supplementary material for all the subjects (rich media, see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). For this subject (P03) the measured voltages are tightly correlated across locations with the predicted electric potential values. The same is true for all subjects resulting in high Pearson correlation coefficients, <i>r</i> = 0.95 \u00b1 0.04 (Here and in the following all summary statistics indicate mean and standard deviation across subjects). To determine the electric fields at each electrode we calculated the difference of the recorded voltages between neighboring electrodes divided by inter-electrode distance (see 'Voltage and projected electric field measurements'). This provides a measure of the local electric field along the direction of a given electrode pair in units of V/m, which we refer to as the \u2018projected electric field\u2019. The measured and predicted values of this projected electric field are shown for one subject in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>. As expected, the correlation of predicted and measured electric fields is lower than for the raw potentials (here <i>r</i> = 0.90, <i>p</i> = 10<sup>\u221227</sup>, <i>N</i> = 71), as the calculated field is the difference of two close-by measurements, each with some inherent noise. Similar results are obtained for all ten subjects (<i>r</i> = 0.83 \u00b1 0.12), suggesting that the spatial distribution of electric field magnitudes is well predicted by the models. When collapsing all recordings across subjects (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F/G</a>) we find correlation between measured and predicted field projections of <i>r</i> = 0.89 (<i>p</i> = 10<sup>\u2212197</sup>, <i>N</i> = 581) and <i>r</i> = 0.84 (p = 10<sup>\u221267</sup>, <i>N</i> = 250) for cortical and depth electrodes respectively. Note also that the measured field projections in depth electrodes are nearly as strong as in cortical electrodes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> vs. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>; standard deviation of measured field projections across electrodes are 0.031 V/m and 0.029 V/m, respectively)."

We ask, in particular, what are the maximum intensities achieved at the cortical surface and in deep brain regions? The electrode configuration used in the experiments gives a range of values within and across individuals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). All values reported here and in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> are scaled to 1 mA of stimulation. As expected for distant electrodes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Dmochowski et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">2012</a>), strongest electric fields are achieved under the stimulating electrodes (e.g. under the occipital electrode, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C/D</a>). Maximal field intensities for the mid-line configuration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) are 0.16 V/m \u00b1\u00a00.04 V/m across the ten subjects (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). For an intensity of 2 mA typically used in clinical trials this would result in fields of 0.32 V/m. For other stimulation configurations on Subject P014 with electrodes away from the mid-line (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, which is more typical for clinical interventions), maximum intensity on cortex for 1 mA stimulation was 0.12 V/m and 0.05 V/m at the fronto-lateral and lateral occipital locations respectively. We also model other electrode configurations commonly used clinical trials, e.g., M1\u2013SO (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). For the three configurations tested here, maximum field intensities in cortical locations was 0.19 V/m \u00b1\u00a00.04 V/m, again for 1 mA. To provide a sense of what intensities are reached in more extended areas (not just at the 1 mm<sup>3</sup> voxel with largest value) <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> also reports the 95th percentile (0.08 V/m \u00b1\u00a00.01 V/m), following previous practice (<a href=\"#bib83\">Parazzini et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alam et al., 2016</a>)."

First, conductivity values reported in the literature used in existing models tend to overestimate electric field magnitudes (see values in 'Conductivity optimization'). For example, measured electric field magnitudes in Subject P03 were only 50% of the predicted values, as indicated by the slope <i>s</i> = 0.5 of the best linear fit of the measured versus predicted field projections shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>. This is true for all subjects (for voltage: <i>s</i> = 0.46 \u00b1 0.14; for field: <i>s</i> = 0.40 \u00b1 0.15. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C/D</a> under \u2018literature\u2019). The conductivity values typically used in the literature overestimate the amount of current that crosses the skull and underestimate the amount shunted through the scalp. We calibrated the models by adjusting conductivity values for each individual model with the goal of minimizing the mean square error between predicted and measured field projections (see 'Conductivity optimization'; example of a best fit for P03 is shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The best fitted conductivity values vary across individuals (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013G</a>). Generally the fitting procedure showed that the parameters are not tightly bounded by the data. We estimated the uncertainty of the optimal conductivities by analyzing the sensitivity of the fitting criterion to small changes in these parameters (see 'Conductivity optimization' and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

                                "text": "Since the introduction of detailed anatomical models at 1 mm<sup>3</sup> resolution (<a href=\"#bib24\">Datta et al., 2009</a>) there have been significant efforts to improve computational current-flow models by including additional tissue compartments (i.e. CSF, bone layers, and white matter). However, there is an ongoing debate as to the relative merits of each of these model refinements (see 'Guidelines for modeling'). To provide some guidelines to future modeling efforts we built models incorporating various refinements proposed in the literature (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) and compared model predictions to the empirical data in terms of the spatial distribution of projected electric fields (correlation metric reported in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). To test whether individual anatomy is important for current-flow modeling, we compared recordings from one subject to predictions from other subjects. Specifically, for each subject (e.g. P03), the recordings were compared to model predictions obtained from other subjects (e.g. P04\u2013P014) at co-registered electrodes locations. This was done for all the 10 subjects, each one comparing with the other 9 (a total of 90 comparisons). Correlation of recordings with these predictions using a different head model is significantly worse as compared to predicting values from the correct individual model (t-test on the difference between correlations: <i>t</i>(89) = 5.60, <i>p</i> = 10<sup>\u22127</sup>). This confirms that modeling individual anatomy is important. Many have argued that it is important to incorporate the entire head anatomy down to the neck. Since the MRI of most patients is truncated at the base of the skull, we extended the field of view (FOV) using a standard head that captures the average anatomy of the lower head (see 'General procedure'). This extended FOV gives significantly better predictions as compared to the original FOV, in terms of the electric field magnitudes (<i>t</i>(10) = 3.34, <i>p</i> = 0.007) and electric field distributions (<i>t</i>(10) = 2.63, <i>p</i> = 0.03; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, comparing RMcut vs. RM). Note that P04 and P06 were not included in this comparison as the FOV on these two subjects could not be extended (see 'General procedure'). We next tested the importance of CSF by removing the CSF compartment from the intact model \u2013 a model capturing the individual anatomy prior to craniotomy and electrode implantation. This did not significantly affect the distribution of estimated electric fields (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, comparing correlations for IM vs. IM-CSF, <i>t</i>(12) = 1.78, <i>p</i> = 0.10), but did deteriorate the accuracy in predicting the magnitude of electric fields (comparing slopes, <i>t</i>(12) = 10.79, <i>p</i> = 10<sup>\u22127</sup>). Incorporating heterogeneous conductivities for various bone compartments does not appear to provide a reliable improvement on magnitude estimates (RM vs. RM + 3skull: <i>t</i>(12) = 1.54, <i>p</i> = 0.15), and it seems to give worse prediction on the electric field distribution (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, RM vs. RM + 3skull: <i>t</i>(12) = 2.35, <i>p</i> = 0.04). For some patients we had diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data available (P06, P07 and P09). Previous modeling studies have advocated including such data to capture anisotropic conductivities. <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> shows the result of incorporating DTI information to the realistic model (RM+DTI) including different ways of converting DTI information into conductivity (RM+DTI/VN, RM+DTI/VC, RM+DTI/EIT; see 'Model categories' and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Three data points are not sufficient for a statistical comparison, but there does not appear to be an obvious advantage to using DTI. Note that all model comparisons were performed using the same fixed conductivity values (from the literature) to avoid biasing the comparisons with optimized parameters. Additionally, model comparisons focused on the accuracy of the spatial distributions, as captured by the correlation values, as they are not strongly impacted by the specific choice of conductivities (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A/B</a>)."

Our main finding is that the intensities of electric field reach 0.4 V/m when using 2 mA transcranially. This is approximately half as strong as previous predictions using computational models (<a href=\"#bib24\">Datta et al., 2009</a>). Peak intensities are achieved underneath the stimulation electrodes, but also in deep midline structures such as the anterior cingulate and the peri-ventricular white matter for the specific configurations tested here. We calibrated models by adjusting skull, scalp and brain conductivity in individual subjects to provide correct electric field magnitudes. We find that individualized models provide predictions of the spatial distribution of currents with an accuracy of <i>r</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.89 for cortical electrodes and <i>r</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.84 for depth electrodes when pooling data across all subjects. These models capture individual anatomy for brain, CSF, skull, air cavities and skin at 1\u00a0mm<sup>3</sup> resolution.

Our study provide a definitive answer to the question of what field intensities can be achieved in human <i>in vivo</i>. Maximal stimulation intensity is difficult to measure directly because the recording electrodes are placed based on clinical considerations, and are thus not arranged where maximal intensities are expected. Subdural electrodes allow measurement of the electric field only tangentially to the cortical surface, whereas strongest field magnitudes underneath the stimulating electrodes are oriented orthogonally to the cortical surface. We thus used the validated and calibrated computational model to estimate the maximal electric field that can be achieved anywhere in the brain. Electric field magnitudes in cortex can be as high as 0.2 V/m for 1 mA stimulation current. For typical electrode configurations used in clinical trials maximal field intensity can reach 0.4 V/m when applying 2 mA. More extended areas can reach a value of 0.16 V/m (95th percentile) under 2 mA stimulation. For some electrode montages, current is shunted into deeper areas through highly conductive CSF with maximal values reaching 0.12 V/m. Based on the present data, previous modeling estimates with maximal intensities around 1 V/m (e.g., <a href=\"#bib24\">Datta et al., 2009</a>) and 95th percentile of 0.35 V/m (e.g., <a href=\"#bib27\">Datta et al., 2012</a>) have to be downwards corrected by a factor of two. While physiological effects <i>in vitro</i> have been found for electric fields as low as 0.2 V/m (for entrainment of coherent gamma oscillations (<a href=\"#bib92\">Reato et al., 2010</a>), other effects have required electric fields of at least 5 V/m (to entrain up/down state transitions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Fr\u00f6hlich and McCormick, 2010</a>); see <a href=\"#bib93\">Reato et al. (2013)</a> for review on AC effects <i>in vitro</i>). Plasticity effects have been demonstrated only at higher field intensities of \u223c20 V/m (<a href=\"#bib91\">Ranieri et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Kronberg et al., 2017</a>). It is possible that network effects amplify electric field effects (<a href=\"#bib92\">Reato et al., 2010</a>) and that larger neurons will be more strongly polarized (<a href=\"#bib88\">Radman et al., 2009</a>) and thus, <i>in vivo</i> effects in human may be stronger than the effects demonstrated for animal <i>in vitro</i> experiments. Future <i>in vivo</i> animal work may shed light on this fundamental question of the required electric field intensities for various physiological effects (e.g., <a href=\"#bib62\">Kar and Krekelberg, 2016</a>)."

While the study does not leverage or evaluate accuracy of computational models, it does estimate maximal electric field to be 0.5 V/m with 1 mA TES. This is twice the intensity estimated from our current data (0.2 V/m for 1 mA stimulation). Nonetheless, these results are broadly in agreement if one considers the differing placement of the stimulation electrodes. We made the deliberate choice of placing electrodes away from the surgical craniotomy to minimize current flow through the highly conducting skull defect. Previous modeling work suggests that electric field estimates do not significantly differ from those for normal anatomy when stimulating electrodes are distant from the skull defect (<a href=\"#bib25\">Datta et al., 2010</a>). We confirmed this in our models, which show only minimal differences in field estimates when modeling the craniotomy as highly conducting CSF (in practice it is largely fluid-filled) versus entirely resistive (air filled). However, when electrodes are directly placed over the skull opening, as in <a href=\"#bib82\">Opitz et al. (2016)</a>, one expects larger electric field intensities than normal as current flows directly into the skull. We thus feel that our estimate is closer to what one may expect in normal skull anatomy. <a href=\"#bib82\">Opitz et al. (2016)</a> also measured voltages for different stimulation frequencies and found a 10% drop in voltage recording between 1\u2013100 Hz. In our equipment we find a 25% drop which we attribute to a non-uniform gain of the equipment (in saline we measured a gain difference of 25% between 1 Hz and 100 Hz)."

Indeed, when using a single set of values (median) we find similar performance (<i>r</i> = 0.81 \u00b1 0.12). Estimating spatial distribution of field magnitudes is important if one intends to use models to select the best electrode configuration to stimulate a particular brain region (<a href=\"#bib30\">Dmochowski et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Ruffini et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Guler et al., 2016</a>).

We confirmed on the present data that modeling individualized anatomy indeed is beneficial in correctly predicting electric field distribution across space. Clinical MRI scans are routinely truncated at the base of the skull limiting the FOV that is available for modeling. By extending FOV with a standard head to capture the anatomy down to the neck we demonstrated that capturing current flows through the entire head significantly improved the modeling results. While most studies argue that the CSF and fluid-filled ventricles should be included in models (<a href=\"#bib113\">Vorwerk et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib116\">Wagner et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Opitz et al., 2015</a>), others have argued that conventional 1\u00a0mm<sup>3</sup> MRI resolution cannot measure CSF space accurately and thus, it can be omitted (<a href=\"#bib59\">Im et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Park et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Jung et al., 2013</a>). Our results indicate that including CSF into the model is important for correctly predicting the magnitude of achieved electric field in the brain."

(2014)</a> argues that modeling the skull as multiple compartments only has a meaningful effect when there is significant volume of cancelous bone along the current path. A complicating factor is that present segmentation algorithms do not automatically extract cancelous bone, making this modeling particularly labor intensive. In our results, manually segmenting a second bone compartment to account for cancelous bone did not significantly improve results. In addition, some have aimed to incorporate anisotropic conductivities using DTI data (<a href=\"#bib117\">Windhoff et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Suh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Rampersad et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib116\">Wagner et al., 2014</a>). We could not evaluate the benefits of DTI modeling statistically, as we had only three subjects with DTI data. But for these three subjects there was no obvious benefit from adding DTI. This is consistent with previous modeling (<a href=\"#bib116\">Wagner et al., 2014</a>), which shows limited effects of DTI-derived anisotropy on the estimates of electric field in cortex (most of our electrodes were in cortex). Additionally, there have been debates as to how exactly the diffusion anisotropy (as measured with DTI) should be converted into anisotropy of the electrical conductivity (<a href=\"#bib105\">Shahid et al., 2013</a>). In fact, the most recent <i>in vivo</i> recordings in humans suggest that white-matter electrical conductivity may actually be isotropic (<a href=\"#bib63\">Koessler et al., 2016</a>), at least when measured at 50 kHz. Here we evaluated the various approaches proposed in the literature, and found no obvious performance difference between them."

This indicates that despite our best efforts, there evidently remain some model inaccuracies. Simplifying tissue to have uniform conductivity is certainly a source of inaccuracy. Improving on this may require improvements in electrical impedance tomography. A source of uncertainty in our experiment is the placement of the stimulating electrodes. We know that small differences in placement significantly affect model predictions, yet the placement could not be conclusively established as the posterior electrode was occluded by bandages and we therefore only have rough anatomical landmarks that guided the placement. Future efforts may want to establish exact electrode placement using 3D localization devices. Other inaccuracies in the modeling may result from errors in segmentation, in particular thin structures such as CSF or temporal bone, which are in some locations below the 1\u00a0mm<sup>3</sup> resolution of the model. Finally, openings in the eye socket such as optical foramen and orbital fissure are hard to establish and could serve to guide significant current for the present electrode montages. The models we tested here did not incorporate all the details that could conceivably affect current flow, and indeed, model accuracy could hopefully be improved from the currently reported values by adding such details. For instance, fatty tissue has been modeled by <a href=\"#bib111\">Truong et al. (2013)</a>, who suggested that electric fields are altered in particular for obese individuals. Other details that may be important are muscle, arteries, sub-compartments of the eyes, and other anatomical details (<a href=\"#bib102\">Sadleir et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Parazzini et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Mekonnen et al., 2012</a>). A general sense for the sensitivity of the model accuracy to errors in segmentation can be obtained by comparing the prediction performance of the intact models and the realistic models (IM vs. RM in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Despite multiple refinements to the segmentation in RM, there was no consistent performance improvement across subjects.

Values commonly used in the literature are in fact the mean values across multiple references (<a href=\"#bib114\">Wagner et al., 2004</a>). These conductivities are mostly measured at 10 Hz or higher frequencies (<a href=\"#bib47\">Gabriel et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Baumann et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Oostendorp et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Peters et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Hoekema et al., 2003</a>). To date the data for the human head measured <i>in vivo</i> under direct current (0 Hz) are rather scarce and date back over sixty years (<a href=\"#bib16\">Burger and Milaan, 1943</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Freygang and Landau, 1955</a>). Just very recently new <i>in vivo</i> measures became available (<a href=\"#bib63\">Koessler et al., 2016</a>) largely confirming the literature values for brain tissue, although these were measured at 50 kHz. Whether these literature values provide correct estimates of electric field magnitude in computational models of the human head has never been directly evaluated <i>in vivo</i>. Here we took a phenomenological approach and adjusted the conductivity of scalp, skull\u00a0and\u00a0brain to match the recorded fields at 1 Hz. The obtained conductivities are \u2018optimal\u2019 in the sense that they best calibrate the resulting electric field intensities inside the brain. Generally, the model fitting appears to be under-constrained as differing parameters gave similar goodness of fit (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). We thus constrained the optimization to only three free parameters. The main goal of optimization was to allow some flexibility for the model to more accurately reflect the overall field magnitudes, which were incorrectly predicted by the conductivity values from the literature. The \u2018optimal\u2019 conductivities thus primarily serve to calibrate, on individual heads, the overall magnitude estimates. Once calibrated, these models were then used to estimate maximal field intensities in each head. However, we caution against interpreting these \u2018optimal\u2019 conductivity values as the true conductivity values of tissue. These best-fit conductivity values are free to account and compensate as best as possible for all sources of modeling simplifications and errors. For instance, the best conductivity obtained for \u2018skin\u2019 has to account for the value of many different soft tissues such as muscle, fat and nerves. This is also true for the skull conductivity, which has to reflect in a single number, different bone layers, which will vary in relative abundance across and within individuals. Also, the optimal conductivities may depend on the location of the stimulation electrodes, segmentation errors, and other modeling choices. Thus, \u2018optimal\u2019 values differ considerably across subjects. Nonetheless, the median values we report here appear to be a good compromise for predicting field distributions when individual calibration is not possible."

The model also appears to be sensitive to gray matter conductivity with a 10% change in accuracy for a 10% change in conductivity values. It is important to note that the model fitting process is strongly affected by the electric field magnitude, which is approximately inversely proportional to conductivity values. On the other hand, the spatial distribution of the predicted electric field is much less affected by the detailed choice of conductivities. Thus, it may not be surprising that optimal values differ across subjects by as much as one order of magnitude, yet a single median value provides reasonable accuracy in terms of spatial distributions across all subjects (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>)."

Targeting aims to select the electrode configuration that achieves highest intensity in one location while perhaps minimizing stimulation intensity elsewhere in the brain (<a href=\"#bib30\">Dmochowski et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Ruffini et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Guler et al., 2016</a>). We attempted to provide error bars on the estimated electric fields by comparing repeated measures over an interval of approximately 15\u201330 min. We found relatively little variation in the voltage measurements (\u00b10.05 mV, e.g., <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and note that the variations we did observe were likely due to subject movement. Recent evidence and our own observations confirm that voltage measurements depend sensitively on subject position and even blood pulse (<a href=\"#bib78\">Noury et al., 2016</a>). Both phenomena are readily explained by the shunting effect of the highly conducting CSF. Small variations with subject position have been demonstrated to affect the thickness of CSF layer and thus modulate the current flow between brain and scalp (<a href=\"#bib95\">Rice et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, the variability of electric fields estimated here (with relatively quiescent subjects) likely underestimates the true variability occurring in practice. We conclude that with <i>r</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12 the spatial distribution of electric field predicted by computational models is likely not far from the actual field distributions when taking into account their inherent variability across time, due to subject motion, position, blood pressure, electrode contact, etc. In this sense, the present study suggests that the current high-resolution model is a good foundation in order to select among different possible electrode configurations, and that model predictions with regard to stimulation focality are meaningful."

Intracranial EEG signals were referenced to a two-contact subgaleal strip facing towards the skull near the craniotomy site. A similar two-contact strip screwed to the skull was used for the instrument ground. Grid arrays and strips made from stainless steel and embedded in silastic sheets were implanted on the cortex. They have 2.3 mm diameter contacts with 10 mm center-center spacing. Depth electrodes made from platinum-iridium are inserted deep into the brain (around hippocampus). They have 2.4 mm contact length with 5 mm spacing. The decision to implant, electrode targeting, and the duration of invasive monitoring were determined solely on clinical grounds and without reference to this study. Subdural electrodes covered extensive portions of lateral and medial frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal cortex of the left and/or right hemisphere (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

Variation in impedance of up to 50 kOhm across electrodes would contribute at most 0.05 percent error in the voltage measurements.

Briefly, the registered and resliced pre-op image was segmented by the New Segment toolbox (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ashburner and Friston, 2005</a>) in Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) implemented in Matlab (R2013a, MathWorks, Natick, MA). Segmentation errors such as discontinuities in CSF and noisy voxels were corrected first by a customized Matlab script (<a href=\"#bib57\">Huang et al., 2013</a>) and then by hand in an interactive segmentation software ScanIP (v4.2, Simpleware Ltd, Exeter, UK). The field of view (FOV) of the clinical MRI scans was extended down to the neck by applying SPM8 registration functions \u2018Coregister\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Collignon et al., 1995</a>) and \u2018Normalise\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Friston et al., 1995</a>) to a standard head (<a href=\"#bib57\">Huang et al., 2013</a>), and then resampling the registered head and pasting it to the MRI of each individual patient. This process uses the soft-tissue as landmark for registration. It extrapolates reasonably well to align skull and soft-tissue in 8 of the 10 patients. For P04 and P06 we had to leave the FOV restricted to the original MRI scan. The 2 \u00d7\u00a02 cm stimulation electrodes were manually created and positioned interactively into the model using ScanCAD module within ScanIP as follows. We took photographs of electrode placement in each patient, and placed the electrode in the model based on the positions shown in these pictures. However, this process was limited by the bandages which occluded the stimulating electrodes, in particular on the back of the head. There the electrode was placed halfway over the occipital ridge unless the photographs suggested otherwise. For each patient a finite element model (FEM,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib66\">Logan, 2007</a>) was generated from the segmentation data by the ScanFE module in ScanIP and then the electric potential distribution was solved by Abaqus (v6.11, SIMULIA, Providence, RI) under 1 A/m<math id=\"inf6\"><msup><mi></mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math> current density injected into the frontal stimulation electrode (<a href=\"#bib49\">Griffiths, 1999</a>).

Specifically, the craniotomy was modeled by inserting a cylinder of the same diameter as the burr hole into the skull and then intersecting the skull voxels. These voxels were given CSF conductivity and this area was covered by soft-tissue (skin conductivity). Additional instruments used during the surgery, such as the subgaleal electrodes and the Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain used to vacuum blood products, were modeled by manually drawing out the corresponding voxels from the post-op MRI. Since the intracranial electrode contacts are extremely small (the thickness is less than 1 mm in grid arrays and linear strips), we did not model them explicitly. Instead, we did model the geometry of the grid arrays and linear strips, by taking voxels from the CSF. To this end, customized Matlab script was written to generate cylinders along adjacent intracranial electrodes on the strips and arrays and then intersect with the CSF voxels. The insulated wires running through the scalp were not modeled as their diameter (&lt;1 mm) is not expected to significantly affect the predicted current flow. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013F</a> shows a 3D rendering of such a realistic model for Subject P06.

The mean of the non-diffusion-weighted (b0) volumes was then used to create the DTI brain mask via the FSL \u2018BET\u2019 utility (<a href=\"#bib106\">Smith, 2002</a>). Since the conductivity tensor is required to be positive semi-definite, the diffusion tensor was calculated for the brain voxels with a non-linear optimization relying on positive-definiteness constraints (<a href=\"#bib60\">Jones and Basser, 2004</a>) as implemented in the Camino software (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cook et al., 2006</a>). After this, to integrate the DTI data into the model, the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the diffusion tensor was computed and registered with an affine transformation to the voxel space of the post-op MRI (where the model is built). To circumvent the complexity of spatially transforming the diffusion tensors, the previous transform was applied to all the distortion-corrected diffusion-weighted volumes. The positive semi-definite diffusion tensor was then computed again from the transformed diffusion-weighted data, but within a different brain mask defined by the model. See <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a> for a slice view of the diffusion tensor of Subject P06. Each mesh node in the model was then associated to the nearest diffusion tensor. These diffusion tensors were then converted into conductivity tensors using one of four different algorithms used in the literature: direct mapping (<a href=\"#bib112\">Tuch et al., 2001</a>); volume normalized (<a href=\"#bib52\">Hallez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">G\u00fcllmar et al., 2010</a>); volume constrained (<a href=\"#bib118\">Wolters et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Rullmann et al., 2009</a>); and equivalent isotropic trace (<a href=\"#bib73\">Miranda et al., 2001</a>).

Mean across electrodes was subtracted from both recordings and model predictions before evaluating the cost function. A general purpose optimization algorithm \u2013 Pattern Search (<a href=\"#bib9\">Audet and Dennis, 2002</a>), available in Matlab \u2013 was used to solve this optimization. This procedure was carried out only on the realistic model for each subject individually. In fitting conductivity parameters we found that the values are generally under-constrained (very different conductivity values can give similar goodness of fit). We therefore limited the fitting to adjusting scalp, skull, and brain conductivities, but fixed CSF (1.65 S/m) and maintained the ratio between gray and white matter constant (=2.19) reflecting the values reported in the literature. Thus there are only three free parameters in the optimization, which is also beneficial in order to keep computing times reasonable. Each model evaluation took approximately 30 min, and optimization was terminated after 300 evaluations of the Pattern Search algorithm. Note that the conductivities of the tissues are optimized jointly, that\u00a0is, they are adjusted simultaneously per evaluation of the cost function."

As one of the reviewers noted, \"This manuscript is of exceptional importance as it provides unique, much needed, and highly sophisticated measurement, modeling, and analysis of the electric field in the human brain due to transcranial electrical stimulation (tES).\" The paper provides the first thorough validation of computational models of transcranial current stimulation. While there are concerns with the modeling approaches used to make electric field estimates, the measured fields in the vicinity of the electrodes provide a direct measure that are independent of the modeling. These estimates provide the most direct observations of tES induced E-field in the human brain, an extremely important contribution. The data set is substantial and, as indicated by the authors, will be made available publicly, a valuable resource for the community. In summary, the reviewers felt that the paper, when appropriately revised, will be a landmark report in this literature and of great use to the growing community interested in using, modeling, and optimizing this stimulation technology."

Obviously, any unintended voltage attenuation, while not critical for intracranial EEG, can affect all estimates of E-field strength and tissue conductivities in this study. Furthermore, it is implied that there was clipping of the signal in some electrodes (data from them were not included in the analysis).

Two issues that come up when comparing the studies are 1) possible frequency-dependent effects and the manner in which these were analyzed, and 2) differences in how electric fields are estimated. For example, for electrodes in the interior of the grid why not use all neighbors instead of just the closest one?"

It seems, however, that the models were optimized only for the \"realistic model\" without the respective anatomical refinements. This should be clarified, and if this is indeed the case, the comparisons are biased since one side of the comparison is optimized and the other is not. Furthermore, the white matter conductivity anisotropy affects mostly the E-field in the white matter, while most of the voltage recordings were not in the white matter, which could affect efforts to optimize the anisotropic model fit to the data."

Furthermore, only a limited set of tissues are modeled, and other potentially significant ones are omitted such as muscle, fat, and sub-compartments of the eye.

It is unclear what physical mechanism could possibly confer such high conductivity. While this is acknowledged by the authors, this is an issue of concern. Since they are based on a fit of a complicated model with just two free parameters to a limited data set, it is entirely possible that the optimized conductivity values result from unrecognized limitations of the model and/or recordings. For example, truncation of the head and neck (as seen in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) or other anatomical inaccuracies in the lower portion of the head could artificially strengthen the modelled current flow in the top portion of the head, requiring higher scalp conductivity values to match the recorded potentials. Further, the optimized conductivity values may depend on the location of the tES electrodes. Adopting the \"optimal\" values from this study in general for tES (and potentially other) simulations may produce errors when the model context changes. We would like you to consider quantifying the impact of these model limitations; for example, test the impact of head truncation and reduction of the number of segmented tissue compartments in one of the full head and neck models. In addition, the revision should be explicit about these limitations and impact on inferences to be drawn from this work."

The solution of problem (A) is attempted through a minimization of error between measured and predicted values as given by Equation 1. The solution of problem (B) is obtained through the Abaqus software. For the estimates of the electric field to be meaningful, a reasonable accuracy estimate must be associated with the estimate. No such estimate is given. To do so would require at least the following: (i) A reasonable estimate of the error produced in results of problems (A) and (B) that is associated with assumption that the conductivity is spatially constant throughout each of the 6 segmented regions and (ii) A reasonable estimate of the error in the results of problems (A) and (B) associated the measurement and segmentation of the six regions.

Please review your manuscript from the reader point of view, rigorously stripping methods material from Results and inserting descriptive phrases and referrals to Methods in Results where needed. The statistics should be described more carefully in the Methods section. A number of experimental details are missing or not clear, including the specific criteria by which some patients were excluded and also by which electrodes were excluded within a given patient (since the latter is a very significant fraction of the total number of electrodes this seems particularly important) and what the range of electrodes was across all subjects (we are only given the total).
