Because direct mechanical stimulation of tip links has not been experimentally possible, this hypothesis has not been tested. We have engineered DNA tethers that link superparamagnetic beads to tip links and exert mechanical forces on the links when exposed to a magnetic-field gradient. By pulling directly on tip links of the bullfrog's sacculus we have evoked transduction currents from hair cells, confirming the hypothesis that tension in the tip links opens transduction channels. This demonstration of direct mechanical access to tip links additionally lays a foundation for experiments probing the mechanics of individual channels."

Because direct mechanical stimulation of tip links has not been experimentally possible, this hypothesis has not been tested. We have engineered DNA tethers that link superparamagnetic beads to tip links and exert mechanical forces on the links when exposed to a magnetic-field gradient. By pulling directly on tip links of the bullfrog's sacculus we have evoked transduction currents from hair cells, confirming the hypothesis that tension in the tip links opens transduction channels. This demonstration of direct mechanical access to tip links additionally lays a foundation for experiments probing the mechanics of individual channels."

Sound waves and head movements apply a mechanical force to hair cells inside the inner ear. This causes the cells to produce electrical signals that ultimately communicate information about the sound or movement to the brain. The apparatus that converts mechanical forces into electrical signals is called the hair bundle, which is an upright cluster of small rods called stereocilia that protrude from the hair cell's flattened top surface. Fine filaments called tip links connect the stereocilia within a hair bundle to one another."

The resultant flow of ions across the hair cell's membrane would then cause a voltage change that in turn triggers the cell\u2019s electrical response. It has not been possible to test this hypothesis, however, because the position of the tip links within a hair bundle prevents them from being stimulated directly in experiments."

The DNA acted as a string that penetrated into the hair bundles, connecting the tip links to magnetic beads outside the bundles. This meant that moving the bead by applying a magnetic force to it pulled upon the tip links, and the investigators observed that this activated the associated ion channels. The resultant electrical signals confirmed that tip links play a role in the responses of hair cells."

The upper two-thirds of this link comprises a parallel dimer of cadherin 23 (CDH23) molecules whereas the lower third encompasses a parallel dimer of protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) molecules (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kazmierczak et al., 2007</a>)."

Because each tip link resides in a confined space at the hair bundle's top, it is impractical to ligate the antibodies directly to a probe particle for use with optical or magnetic tweezers. We therefore created a mechanical tether for the tip link by interposing a 3 kb, double-stranded DNA molecule between the attached antibody and a 1\u2009\u03bcm-diameter superparamagnetic bead (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The DNA molecule was obtained by PCR of a plasmid with primers that incorporated biotin and fluorescein moieties at the molecule's opposite ends. The biotinylated terminus bound through a streptavidin molecule to a biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG, which in turn bound the rabbit\u00a0anti-CDH23. The fluorescein-modified end of the DNA adhered to a superparamagnetic bead coated with anti-fluorescein. The tether provided sufficient separation between the tip link and the relatively large bead to overcome the problem of steric inaccessibility."

The artifacts, however, should\u00a0have reversed signs in accordance with Faraday\u2019s law. To separate the transduction responses from artifacts, we therefore applied to the magnet successive voltage pulses of a constant magnitude but opposite polarities. By averaging the responses to these two stimuli we removed the artifacts and preserved only the responses owing to mechanoelectrical transduction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The peak response in nine experiments was 38.7 \u00b1 9.8 \u03bcV (mean \u00b1 standard deviation), roughly one-tenth the maximal value expected if every tip link were stimulated. That the responses to currents of opposite polarity were largely the same also indicated that the signals originated primarily from mechanoelectrical transduction rather than electromagnetic interference.

Conventional stimulation of a hair bundle is thought to tense each tip link and open the associated channels. Aided by the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the myosin molecules that secure the upper ends of the tip links, this tension then declines, resulting in adaptation of the electrical response (<a href=\"#bib12\">Howard and Hudspeth, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Assad et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hacohen et al., 1989</a>). Magnetic stimulation, in contrast, should pull the top ends of the tip links upward. This force not only opened transduction channels but evidently restrained the insertional plaques from descending as well. Recovery from the vertical offset of the plaques might explain why the electrical response relaxed far more slowly than during conventional adaptation. Because the magnitude of the response was sensitive to the strength of magnetic stimulation, the long plateau observed during protracted magnetic stimulation did not stem from saturation of the response."

Although that form of stimulation would be difficult to reconcile with the protracted adaptation observed during extended magnetic stimulation, we nevertheless performed an additional experiment to eliminate this possibility and ensure that the measured potentials resulted from upward tension in the tip links. The preparation was positioned in a sample holder with a 10\u00b0 tilt between the saccular epithelium and the plane of the magnet's pole piece (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). After tethering superparamagnetic beads as usual, we scraped away most of the beads with an eyelash, leaving beads and intact hair bundles only in the segment of the epithelium opposite the saccular nerve (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Throughout that region the hair bundles display a common direction of excitability away from the nerve. In the tilted configuration any magnetic force tangent to the epithelial surface would have pulled the hair bundles toward their short edges and would therefore have countered the conventional electrical response. Even under these conditions we observed a transduction current of the usual polarity but of diminished magnitude owing to the removal of most tethered beads (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>).

This region was selected on the basis of its probable accessibility and antigenicity and because it occurs near the uppermost of CDH23's 27 extracellular cadherin domains. Using primers based on the DNA sequence for the zebrafish's <i>cdh23</i> (NM_214809), we obtained a product by RT-PCR of the RNA isolated from a single bullfrog's sacculus (Superscript III One-Step RT-PCR System, Invitrogen). This cDNA was inserted into the vector pCR2.1-TOPO and sequenced to confirm its identity. The corresponding polypeptide DDNEPIFVRPPRGA was synthesized with the addition of a cysteine residue at its amino terminal and with amidation of its carboxyl terminal. Following the immunization of two rabbits (Covance), the resultant serum (RU1793) was affinity-purified against the immunizing peptide."

                                "text": "There are two ways to estimate the maximal transepithelial current that might be evoked by activating all the transduction channels. First, a cluster of hair bundles representing about one-seventh of the saccular complement produces a peak transepithelial response near 500 \u03bcV during conventional stimulation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Corey and Hudspeth, 1983b</a>), so activating every cell in the sensory epithelium would yield about 3500 \u03bcV. The second approach is to consider that an individual hair cell from the frog's sacculus typically produces a peak transduction current of 200\u2009pA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gillespie and Hudspeth, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cheung and Corey, 2006</a>), so the 2000 or so cells in a medium-sized sacculus (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jacobs and Hudspeth, 1990</a>) would yield a total current of about 400 nA. Returning across an epithelium of resistance 10 k\u03a9, that current would yield a transepithelial signal of 4000 \u03bcV, a value in good agreement with the first calculation. If magnetic stimulation were to increase the open probability of all the preparation's transduction channels by 10% as calculated from our calibration of the magnetic force, the magnetic stimuli would be expected to produce signals of 350\u2013400 \u03bcV at most. The value would be approximately one-tenth as great on the basis of <i>ab initio</i> calculations. Because only a small fraction of the tip links are attached to beads, however, the actual responses should be still smaller."

While the work presented in the manuscript is strong, it is not yet fully convincing and a specific additional experiment is needed to show that the stimulation due to upward forces indeed depends on the presence of intact tip links on which the force is applied."

[\u2026] An ab initio calculation provides only a lower estimate of the magnetic force, however, and requires scaling by an empirically determined factor to accord with measured values (Lipfert et al., 2009; Shevkoplyas et al., 2007).\u201d"
