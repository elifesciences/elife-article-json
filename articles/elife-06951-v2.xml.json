A novel alternative strategy is to develop pigs that are genetically resistant to infection. Here, we produce transgenic (TG) pigs that constitutively expressed FMDV-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) derived from small hairpin RNA (shRNA). In vitro challenge of TG fibroblasts showed the shRNA suppressed viral growth. TG and non-TG pigs were challenged by intramuscular injection with 100 LD<sub>50</sub> of FMDV. High fever, severe clinical signs of foot-and-mouth disease and typical histopathological changes were observed in all of the non-TG pigs but in none of the high-siRNA pigs. Our results show that TG shRNA can provide a viable tool for producing animals with enhanced resistance to FMDV."

A novel alternative strategy is to develop pigs that are genetically resistant to infection. Here, we produce transgenic (TG) pigs that constitutively expressed FMDV-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) derived from small hairpin RNA (shRNA). In vitro challenge of TG fibroblasts showed the shRNA suppressed viral growth. TG and non-TG pigs were challenged by intramuscular injection with 100 LD<sub>50</sub> of FMDV. High fever, severe clinical signs of foot-and-mouth disease and typical histopathological changes were observed in all of the non-TG pigs but in none of the high-siRNA pigs. Our results show that TG shRNA can provide a viable tool for producing animals with enhanced resistance to FMDV."

Compared with normal mice infected with the foot-and-mouth disease virus, the genetically engineered mice showed little sign of the disease in their bodies. Now, Hu, Qiao, Fu et al.\u2014including some of the researchers involved in the 2010 work\u2014have genetically engineered pigs in the same way. The experiments show that when cells from these pigs are exposed to the foot-and-mouth disease virus in the laboratory, the virus grows much less than normal."

All of the normal pigs developed severe symptoms very quickly, including the disease's characteristic mouth and foot sores. Additionally, examinations of these pigs' cells showed signs of the disease. But the genetically engineered pigs did not become seriously ill and their cells showed little sign of the disease. Some of the genetically engineered pigs developed a few sores but these sores appeared much later than normal. So far, the results suggest that it may be possible to develop pigs that are resistant to foot-and-mouth disease. Hu, Qiao, Fu et al. will next determine whether or not the genetically engineered pigs can pass the foot-and-mouth virus on to other pigs and livestock."

The etiological agent of FMD is foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), which belongs to the genus aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bachrach, 1968</a>). Some control strategies including eradication, vaccination, selective test and slaughter have been widely used for preventing FMDV infection (<a href=\"#bib19\">Leforban, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barnett and Carabin, 2002</a>), but diseases caused by FMDV remain prevalent in pigs and cattle all over the world owing to the absence of reciprocal protection among several FMDV serotypes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Haydon et al., 2001</a>)."

The shRNA was proposed as a therapy for suppressing the infection of FMDV in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kim et al., 2008</a>). Recently, we extended that finding by producing genetically engineered mice integrating shRNA targeting FMDV (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pengyan et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2010</a>). The majority of transgenic (TG) mice infected with FMDV were resistant to infection and showed only slightly abnormal pathology compared with controls.

The V3 shRNA reduced the expression of viral RNA by 96.8% compared to scrambled control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The V3 shRNA expression vector was used to generate TG pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer. A total of 42 pigs were born alive, eight of which survived at least 6 months. TG pigs contained the stably integrated transgene as evidenced by PCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

No viral RNA in the non-TG heart, lung, spleen and liver showed clearance of viral RNA from the tissues, consistent with prior findings (<a href=\"#bib31\">Zhang and Alexandersen, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2006</a>).

Levels of viral RNA in foot lesions of TG pigs were much lower than those in the non-TG pigs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), suggesting an encouraging result for blocking transmission."

Although protective immune responses from vaccination against FMDV can be efficacious, the rapidity of virus replication and spread can outpace the development of immune defenses and overrun the immune system (<a href=\"#bib30\">Summerfield et al., 2009</a>). Current FMDV vaccines do not induce a protective response until 7 d post-vaccination (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barnett et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Doel, 2003</a>). FMD signs in high-siRNA TG pigs in our study were delayed for at least 8 d after FMDV infection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). siRNA expressed in TG pigs can also play a role as co-agent to induce rapid resistance before routine vaccination can evoke protective immunity. TG siRNA pigs immunized with current vaccines may achieve complete protection for an FMDV outbreak, which provides a novel strategy for preventing FMD in a disease-free country."

The authors suggest that the reason there is viral RNA in the serum of both TG and non-TG pigs at all times postinfection is probably due to contamination by aerosol transmission of virus. In the Materials and methods section the authors don't indicate if the TG and non-TG animals were kept in separate rooms. From their answer to this comment it would appear that all animals were kept together in one room. The authors need to clarify this. If the two groups were kept in separate rooms it is difficult to conclude that the presence of viral RNA in the serum of TG animals was due to aerosol contamination and this strongly suggests that the TG animals did in fact get infected. Certainly the TG animals are more protected from disease than the non-TG animals, e.g., see the clinical scores in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. I believe that it is important to show the data from the first manuscript (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) that indicates the level of viral RNA in the serum of TG vs non-TG animals over the course of the challenge. It clearly shows much higher levels of viral RNA in the non-TG pigs as compared to the TG pigs. This is in support of the clinical score data. Therefore, I would not eliminate this panel as the authors have done. Clearly this is a very important point. However, I would definitely suggest that in future experiments the control and experimental groups be kept in separate rooms."

The authors suggest that the reason there is viral RNA in the serum of both TG and non-TG pigs at all times postinfection is probably due to contamination by aerosol transmission of virus. In the Materials and methods section the authors don't indicate if the TG and non-TG animals were kept in separate rooms. From their answer to this comment it would appear that all animals were kept together in one room. The authors need to clarify this. If the two groups were kept in separate rooms it is difficult to conclude that the presence of viral RNA in the serum of TG animals was due to aerosol contamination and this strongly suggests that the TG animals did in fact get infected. Certainly the TG animals are more protected from disease than the non-TG animals, e.g., see the clinical scores in</i> <a href=\"#fig4\"><i>Figure 4A</i></a><i>. I believe that it is important to show the data from the first manuscript (</i><a href=\"#fig4\"><i>Figure 4B</i></a><i>) that indicates the level of viral RNA in the serum of TG vs non-TG animals over the course of the challenge. It clearly shows much higher levels of viral RNA in the non-TG pigs as compared to the TG pigs. This is in support of the clinical score data. Therefore, I would not eliminate this panel as the authors have done. Clearly this is a very important point. However, I would definitely suggest that in future experiments the control and experimental groups be kept in separate rooms</i>."
