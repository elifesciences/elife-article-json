AUG recognition evokes rearrangement of the PIC from an open, scanning to a closed, arrested conformation. Cryo-EM reconstructions of yeast PICs suggest remodeling of the interface between 40S protein Rps5/uS7 and eIF2\u03b1 between open and closed states; however, its importance was unknown. uS7 substitutions disrupting eIF2\u03b1 contacts favored in the open complex increase initiation at suboptimal sites, and uS7-S223D stabilizes TC binding to PICs reconstituted with a UUG start codon, indicating inappropriate rearrangement to the closed state. Conversely, uS7-D215 substitutions, perturbing uS7-eIF2\u03b1 interaction in the closed state, confer the opposite phenotypes of hyperaccuracy and (for D215L) accelerated TC dissociation from reconstituted PICs. Thus, remodeling of the uS7/eIF2\u03b1 interface appears to stabilize first the open, and then the closed state of the PIC to promote accurate AUG selection in vivo."
