                    "text": "Pharmacological studies in mammals suggest that norepinephrine (NE) plays an important role in promoting arousal. However, the role of endogenous NE is unclear, with contradicting reports concerning the sleep phenotypes of mice lacking NE due to mutation of <i>dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase</i> (<i>dbh</i>). To investigate NE function in an alternative vertebrate model, we generated <i>dbh</i> mutant zebrafish. In contrast to mice, these animals exhibit dramatically increased sleep. Surprisingly, despite an increase in sleep, <i>dbh</i> mutant zebrafish have a reduced arousal threshold. These phenotypes are also observed in zebrafish treated with small molecules that inhibit NE signaling, suggesting that they are caused by the lack of NE. Using genetic overexpression of hypocretin (Hcrt) and optogenetic activation of <i>hcrt</i>-expressing neurons, we also find that NE is important for Hcrt-induced arousal. These results establish a role for endogenous NE in promoting arousal and indicate that NE is a critical downstream effector of Hcrt neurons."

However, the role of endogenous NE is unclear, with contradicting reports concerning the sleep phenotypes of mice lacking NE due to mutation of <i>dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase</i> (<i>dbh</i>). To investigate NE function in an alternative vertebrate model, we generated <i>dbh</i> mutant zebrafish. In contrast to mice, these animals exhibit dramatically increased sleep. Surprisingly, despite an increase in sleep, <i>dbh</i> mutant zebrafish have a reduced arousal threshold. These phenotypes are also observed in zebrafish treated with small molecules that inhibit NE signaling, suggesting that they are caused by the lack of NE. Using genetic overexpression of hypocretin (Hcrt) and optogenetic activation of <i>hcrt</i>-expressing neurons, we also find that NE is important for Hcrt-induced arousal. These results establish a role for endogenous NE in promoting arousal and indicate that NE is a critical downstream effector of Hcrt neurons."

Several studies have shown that neuronal centers that regulate sleep and wakefulness lie predominantly in the hypothalamus and brainstem (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Saper et al., 2005</a>), and many of the neurotransmitters and neuropeptides employed by these centers are known. However, it remains unclear how these centers interact with each other, and what specific functions are fulfilled by the neurotransmitters and neuropeptides they employ. Norepinephrine (NE) is one of the most abundant neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous systems, and has been implicated in many aspects of physiology and behavior, including cognition, attention, reward, locomotion and arousal (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berridge and Waterhouse, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Weinshenker and Schroeder, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sara, 2009</a>). Small molecule activators of NE signaling have been shown to increase wakefulness, whereas inhibitors promote sleep (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berridge et al., 2012</a>). These results suggest that NE plays a significant role in promoting arousal. However, the role of endogenous NE in regulating the sleep/wake cycles of vertebrates remains unclear, with contradicting reports concerning the sleep phenotype of mice that do not synthesize NE due to mutation of <i>dopamine beta hydroxylase</i> (<i>dbh</i>) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hunsley and Palmiter, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ouyang et al., 2004</a>)."

Optogenetic studies in mice have shown that activation of the LC promotes sleep-to-wake transitions, while inhibition of the LC reduces time spent awake (<a href=\"#bib14\">Carter et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2012</a>). These studies also showed that activation of the LC plays an important role in mediating the arousing effects of <i>hypocretin</i> (<i>hcrt</i>)-expressing neurons (<a href=\"#bib14\">Carter et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2012</a>), which constitute an important arousal center in the hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sutcliffe and de Lecea, 2002</a>). These observations suggest that NE synthesized in the LC could be involved in mediating Hcrt-induced arousal. However, in addition to NE, the LC also produces other neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that affect sleep, including dopamine (<a href=\"#bib28\">Dzirasa et al., 2006</a>), neuropeptide Y (<a href=\"#bib27\">Dyzma et al., 2010</a>), neurotensin (<a href=\"#bib29\">Erwin and Radcliffe, 1993</a>) and vasopressin (<a href=\"#bib8\">Born et al., 1992</a>). Manipulations of the LC likely affect the synaptic levels of these other neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Therefore, it is unclear whether NE is required to mediate the arousing effects of LC neurons and Hcrt signaling, or if this is accomplished by another factor in LC neurons."

Contrary to <i>dbh</i> null mice (<a href=\"#bib68\">Thomas et al., 1995</a>), zebrafish <i>dbh</i> mutants develop normally and are viable. Importantly, they also exhibit a dramatic increase in sleep. Interestingly, despite increased sleep, these animals display a reduced arousal threshold. Using this mutant, we show that NE is important for arousal that is induced by either genetic overexpression of the Hcrt neuropeptide or optogenetic activation of Hcrt neurons. These results clarify the role of NE in regulating vertebrate sleep and establish a role for NE in mediating Hcrt-induced wakefulness."

Therefore, we reasoned that the zebrafish model system could provide a new platform for exploring the role of endogenous NE in sleep. Three classes of receptors mediate NE signaling: the activating alpha1-and beta-adrenergic receptors and the inhibitory alpha2 adrenergic receptors. For each class there exist at least 5 paralogs in the zebrafish genome, making pharmacological manipulations more practical than genetic manipulations. We first tested the effects of prazosin, a well-established alpha1-adrenergic receptor inhibitor, on zebrafish behavior. We found that, compared to larvae exposed to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle alone, larvae exposed to 100 \u00b5M prazosin showed lower overall activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,D</a>) and activity when awake (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,E</a>) during both day and night, as well as an increase in sleep during both day (+140%) and night (+60%) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,F</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This increase in sleep was primarily due to an increase in the number of sleep bouts (+110% during the day and +70% during the night, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), as well as a smaller increase in sleep bout duration (+20% during the day) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). We also observed a 23% reduction in sleep latency at night in prazosin-treated animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>)."

This dataset allowed us to construct dose\u2013response curves (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and calculate the tapping intensity at which 50% of larvae responded to the stimulus (effective tap power 50, ETP<sub>50</sub>).

Hcrt has been proposed to promote wakefulness in part by stimulating the noradrenergic LC based on several lines of evidence. First, the LC is densely innervated by Hcrt neurons in both zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib54\">Prober et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) and mammals (<a href=\"#bib53\">Peyron et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Chemelli et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Date et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Horvath et al., 1999</a>) and LC neurons express the Hcrt receptor (<a href=\"#bib37\">Horvath et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bourgin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Prober et al., 2006</a>). It is worth noting, however, that the medulla oblongata is another source of NE in the brain, and it also receives Hcrt projections in zebrafish (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and mammals (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ciriello et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang et al., 2004</a>). Second, application of Hcrt peptide depolarizes LC neurons in brain slices (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hagan et al., 1999</a>) and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bourgin et al., 2000</a>). Third, acute inhibition of LC neurons using halorhodopsin inhibits the arousing effects of stimulating Hcrt neurons (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carter et al., 2012</a>). However, despite the evidence that the LC mediates Hcrt-induced arousal, it is unknown whether this process requires NE."

To determine whether the single zebrafish <i>hcrtr</i> ortholog is required for the Hcrt overexpression phenotype in zebrafish larvae, we mated <i>Tg</i>(<i>hsp:Hcrt)</i> zebrafish to a previously described <i>hcrtr</i> mutant (<a href=\"#bib72\">Yokogawa et al., 2007</a>). We subjected the larval progeny to heat shock (HS) during the sixth day post fertilization (dpf) to induce Hcrt overexpression (<a href=\"#bib54\">Prober et al., 2006</a>). We then compared the amount of sleep on night 6 (post-HS) to night 5 (pre-HS). We previously showed that Hcrt protein levels remain elevated for over 48 hr after HS, with no detectable decrease during the first 24 hr after HS (<a href=\"#bib54\">Prober et al., 2006</a>), so overexpressed Hcrt protein should remain at high levels throughout the night following HS. <i>hcrtr</i>+/<i>\u2212</i> and <i>hcrtr\u2212</i>/<i>\u2212</i> larvae reacted similarly to the HS, with no significant difference in the amount of sleep between the two genotypes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Hcrt overexpression decreased the sleep of <i>Tg(hsp:Hcrt);hcrtr</i>+/<i>\u2212</i> larvae by 50% (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>), as previously described for <i>Tg(hsp:Hcrt);hcrtr+/+</i> larvae (<a href=\"#bib54\">Prober et al., 2006</a>). However, no decrease in sleep was observed in <i>Tg(hsp:Hcrt);hcrtr\u2212</i>/<i>\u2212</i> larvae following HS (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). These results indicate that the decrease in sleep following overexpression of Hcrt requires a functional <i>hcrtr</i>."

We first asked whether the presence or absence of NE affects the response of larvae to HS. Larvae lacking the <i>hsp:Hcrt</i> transgene were similarly affected by the HS independently of whether they produced NE or not (no significant difference observed between <i>dbh</i>+/<i>\u2212</i> and <i>dbh\u2212</i>/<i>\u2212</i> larvae, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). We therefore conclude that lack of NE does not affect the response of larvae to HS. We next asked whether NE is required for Hcrt overexpression-induced arousal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). As expected, the amount of sleep exhibited by <i>Tg(hsp:Hcrt)</i> larvae was reduced following Hcrt overexpression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Specifically, the sleep of <i>Tg(hsp:Hcrt)</i>+/\u2212;<i>dbh</i>+/<i>\u2212</i> larvae was reduced to 40% of the pre-HS value (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). However, the sleep of <i>Tg(hsp:Hcrt)</i>+/\u2212;<i>dbh\u2212</i>/<i>\u2212</i> larvae was reduced to 75% of the pre-HS value (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Thus, the majority of Hcrt-induced sleep loss is blocked in the absence of NE. Importantly, treatment of <i>Tg(hsp:Hcrt)</i>+/\u2212 animals with prazosin similarly inhibits Hcrt overexpression-induced arousal (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) suggesting that the <i>dbh</i> mutant phenotype is indeed due to the blocking of noradrenergic signaling. We also confirmed that the suppressed effect of Hcrt overexpression on sleep in <i>dbh</i> and <i>hcrtr</i> mutants is not due to an effect of the mutations on the efficacy of the HS overexpression system (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These results indicate that NE plays an important role in Hcrt-mediated arousal, but suggest that Hcrt also inhibits sleep via NE-independent mechanisms."

We modified the locomotor activity assay by adding an array of blue and red LEDs that uniformly illuminates the 96-well plate, thus allowing simultaneous light stimulation of 96 freely behaving larvae. Larvae at 5 dpf were transferred to a 96-well plate and kept in the dark for 8 hr in the behavioral chamber, after which they were exposed to either red or blue light for 30 min. The behavior of <i>Tg(hcrt:ChR2-EYFP)</i> larvae was compared to their non-transgenic siblings throughout the night with an inter-trial interval of 3 hr. A typical response to blue or red light included a burst of activity at light onset lasting approximately 30 s, followed by a return to near baseline activity levels, a gradual increase in activity that reached a plateau for the remainder of the illumination phase, and a burst of activity when the lights were turned off. The bursts of activity observed at light onset and offset were similar for transgenic and non-transgenic larvae and were excluded from behavioral analysis. <i>Tg(hcrt:ChR2-EYFP)</i> larvae and their non-transgenic siblings exhibited similar levels of locomotor activity when illuminated with red light (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>), a treatment that does not activate ChR2. In contrast, when illuminated with blue light the total locomotor activity of <i>Tg(hcrt:ChR2-EYFP)</i> larvae increased by 46% compared to non-transgenic siblings (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Activation of Hcrt neurons by ChR2 also altered the dynamics of locomotor activity. Specifically <i>Tg(hcrt:ChR2-EYFP)</i> larvae displayed a 25% increase in the maximum activity level reached during stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and reached this maximum activity level 20% faster (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) than sibling controls."

This effect appears to be significantly stronger than the phenotype described in mice (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adamantidis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carter et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that zebrafish may be more sensitive to the arousing effect of Hcrt. These experiments also demonstrate for the first time a large-scale and non-invasive application of optogenetics to manipulate the activity of a small population of neurons deep in the brain of freely behaving animals. This approach may be generally useful for studies of neuronal circuit function in regulating vertebrate behaviors."

Using a transient injection approach (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we generated <i>Tg(hcrt:ChR2-EYFP)</i> and <i>Tg(hcrt:EGFP)</i> larvae in which single LC neurons expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s. After paralyzing and mounting these larvae in low melt agarose, we illuminated with a 488 nm laser a region of the brain containing the Hcrt neuron soma with 10 short pulses (0.3 s each over 3.2 s total), then imaged GCaMP6s fluorescence in the LC for 30 s (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We reasoned that even though we did not stimulate Hcrt neurons and image the LC simultaneously, the short time interval between the final stimulation pulse and the initiation of imaging (&lt;0.1 s), and the relatively slow kinetics of GCaMP6s fluorescence changes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>), would allow us to detect Hcrt neuron-induced effects on LC neuron activity. Indeed, over multiple trials in several animals we observed a significant increase in GCaMP6s fluorescence in <i>Tg(hcrt:ChR2-EYFP)</i> larvae, but not in <i>Tg(hcrt:EGFP)</i> larvae (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>), indicating that stimulation of Hcrt neurons results in activation of the LC in zebrafish larvae."

To test the hypothesis that NE is required for the arousing effect of Hcrt neuron stimulation, we assayed the behavioral effects of optogenetically activated Hcrt neurons in <i>dbh\u2212</i>/<i>\u2212</i> larvae (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

Supplementation of drinking water during gestation with dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS), which is converted to NE by L-aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC), rescues the embryonic lethal phenotype.

Sleep can be distinguished from inactivity using electrophysiology or three behavioral criteria (<a href=\"#bib11\">Campbell and Tobler, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Borbely and Tobler, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Allada and Siegel, 2008</a>). First, sleep primarily occurs during specific periods of the circadian cycle. Second, animals exhibit an increased arousal threshold during sleep, although they can still be aroused by strong stimuli, thus distinguishing sleep from paralysis or coma. Third, sleep is controlled by a homeostatic system, which can be demonstrated as an increased need for sleep following sleep deprivation. Based on these criteria, it has been shown that rest in a variety of organisms, including zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zhdanova et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Prober et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yokogawa et al., 2007</a>), meets the behavioral definition of sleep.

This is not surprising considering the inherent limitations of global exposure to a drug and the fact that each receptor type has at least five paralogs in zebrafish that may have different sensitivities to these drugs. Among these drugs, prazosin most faithfully phenocopied the <i>dbh</i> sleep/wake phenotype (reduced day and night activity and increased day and night sleep) with differences observed in sleep bout number. Clonidine reduced activity and increased sleep during the day, but had almost no effect at night. Bopindolol increased sleep during the day and night, but only inhibited activity at night.

One possible explanation is that the chronic loss of NE in <i>dbh</i> mutant mice may induce compensatory mechanisms during development that do not occur in response to chronic loss of NE in zebrafish. Another possibility is that DOPS treatment during gestation affects developmental processes that ultimately affect behavior. An intriguing third potential explanation involves the role of NE in the mammalian sympathetic nervous system in promoting brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</a>). BAT thermogenesis has been shown to promote slow wave sleep (<a href=\"#bib25\">Dewasmes et al., 2003</a>) and to be required for sleep rebound after sleep deprivation (<a href=\"#bib64\">Szentirmai and Kapas, 2014</a>). Therefore, genetic ablation of <i>dbh</i> could induce two competing effects. In the periphery, lack of NE reduces BAT thermogenesis and thus inhibits sleep. In the central nervous system, lack of NE interferes with the normal arousal function of the LC and thus inhibits wakefulness. The combination of these two opposing forces could result in a minor sleep increase in <i>dbh\u2212</i>/<i>\u2212</i> mice, and the magnitude of this phenotype might be particularly sensitive to experimental conditions. However, zebrafish larvae and flies do not regulate their body temperature and are thus subject only to the sleep promoting effects of NE ablation, resulting in a dramatic increase in sleep. It would be interesting to test whether mice in which <i>dbh</i> is deleted only centrally, and thus have normal BAT thermogenesis in the periphery, display a similarly dramatic sleep increase."

We were surprised to find that although <i>dbh\u2212</i>/<i>\u2212</i> larvae sleep more, they display a lower arousal threshold (i.e. they respond to stimuli of lower intensity), as well as a higher maximal response than sibling controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Genetic ablation of <i>dbh</i> is predicted to increase dopamine levels in neurons that normally express <i>dbh,</i> since this enzyme converts dopamine to NE. Indeed, dopamine levels are higher in <i>dbh</i> mutant mice compared to sibling controls (<a href=\"#bib68\">Thomas et al., 1995</a>). However, pharmacological inhibition of adrenergic receptors should not interfere with the conversion of dopamine to NE. Interestingly, we were able to pharmacologically replicate the reduced arousal phenotype seen in <i>dbh\u2212</i>/<i>\u2212</i> animals by treatment with bopindolol, a beta-adrenergic inhibitor, but not with the alpha1-adrenergic inhibitor prazosin, or the alpha2-adrenergic agonist clonidine. The ability of bopindolol to recapitulate the reduction in arousal threshold seen in the <i>dbh</i> mutant suggests that this aspect of the mutant phenotype is a consequence of the silencing of beta-adrenergic receptor signaling. Furthermore, the inability of prazosin (which increases sleep during day and night) or clonidine (which increases sleep during the day) to recapitulate the phenotype suggests that the observed reduction in arousal threshold is not simply a consequence of lighter sleep due to \u2018over-sleeping\u2019 in the <i>dbh</i> mutant. These observations suggest that lack of beta-adrenergic receptor signaling potentiates responses to sensory stimuli, and are particularly interesting considering that NE reuptake inhibitors such as atomoxetine, which increase NE signaling, are used to treat patients suffering from Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Garnock-Jones and Keating, 2009</a>). It is important to note that these pharmacological results do not preclude a role of excess dopamine release in the <i>dbh</i> mutant by the previously noradrenergic neurons of the LC and/or medulla oblongata in reducing the arousal threshold. This hypothesis is supported by zebrafish studies implicating dopamine in arousal modulation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burgess and Granato, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mu et al., 2012</a>) as well as work demonstrating that dopaminergic stimulation during anesthesia produces a robust arousal response (<a href=\"#bib65\">Taylor et al., 2013</a>).

Fifth, acute inhibition of LC neurons blocks the effect of acute Hcrt neuron activation on sleep to wake transitions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carter et al., 2012</a>). While these studies suggest that the LC plays an important role in mediating Hcrt-induced arousal, it was unknown whether NE, a neurotransmitter in the LC, is required for this process. This question is important because the LC produces other neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that have been shown to affect sleep, including dopamine (<a href=\"#bib28\">Dzirasa et al., 2006</a>), neuropeptide Y (<a href=\"#bib27\">Dyzma et al., 2010</a>), neurotensin (<a href=\"#bib29\">Erwin and Radcliffe, 1993</a>) and vasopressin (<a href=\"#bib8\">Born et al., 1992</a>)."

Second, we developed a large-scale and non-invasive optogenetic assay and used it to activate Hcrt neurons in freely behaving larvae (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Similar to Hcrt overexpression, activation of Hcrt neurons increased locomotor activity, consistent with the increased sleep-to-wake transitions previously described in mammals (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adamantidis et al., 2007</a>). This observation provides evidence of a causal relationship between the activity of Hcrt neurons and locomotor activity in zebrafish, and together with data from the mouse (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adamantidis et al., 2007</a>) supports an evolutionarily conserved role of Hcrt neurons in promoting arousal. We found that the arousing effects of Hcrt overexpression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and Hcrt neuron activation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) were dramatically reduced in <i>dbh</i> mutant larvae, indicating that NE is an important downstream effector of Hcrt-mediated arousal."

Zebrafish Hcrt neurons also send projections to noradrenergic cells in the medulla oblongata, similar to mammals (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ciriello et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang et al., 2004</a>), suggesting that these cells might also mediate Hcrt-induced arousal. Furthermore, in humans, Hcrt neurons are reciprocally connected to other important arousal centers such as the cholinergic basal forebrain, the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus, the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area and the serotonergic dorsal raphe (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexandre et al., 2013</a>). Many of these connections are also present in zebrafish, with Hcrt neurons projecting to dopaminergic, histaminergic and serotonergic populations (<a href=\"#bib52\">Panula et al., 2010</a>). Although functional interactions between Hcrt neurons and these populations have yet to be explored in zebrafish, the anatomical and molecular similarities of zebrafish and mammalian brains suggest that at least a portion of Hcrt-induced arousal is likely to be mediated by these centers."

Dim white light was used to raise larvae for optogenetic experiments to prevent stimulation of ChR2 by ambient light. Individual larvae were placed into each well of a 96-well plate (7701-1651, Whatman, Pittsburgh, PA, United States) containing 650 \u03bcl of E3 embryo medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.33 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4). Locomotor activity was monitored using a videotracking system (Viewpoint Life Sciences, Lyon, France) with a Dinion one-third inch Monochrome camera (Dragonfly 2, Point Grey, Richmond, Canada) fitted with a variable-focus megapixel lens (M5018-MP, Computar, Cary, NC, United States) and infrared filter. The movement of each larva was recorded using the quantization mode. The 96-well plate and camera were housed inside a custom-modified Zebrabox (Viewpoint Life Sciences) that was continuously illuminated with infrared lights. The 96-well plate was housed in a chamber filled with recirculating water to maintain a constant temperature of 28.5\u00b0C.

This setup allowed us to drive the solenoids with voltage ranging from 0 V to 20 V over a range of 4095 settings (from 0.01 to 40.95). In our experiments we used taps ranging from a power setting of 1\u201336.31. Taps of 14 different intensities were applied in a random order from 12:30 am to 7:30 am during the fifth night of development with an inter-trial-interval of 1 min. Previous studies showed that a 15 s interval between repetitive stimuli is sufficient to prevent behavioral habituation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burgess and Granato, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Woods et al., 2014</a>). The background probability of movement was calculated by identifying for each genotype the fraction of larvae that moved 5 s prior to all stimuli delivered during an experiment (14 different tap powers x 30 trials per experiment = 420 data points per larva; average background movement). This value was subtracted from the average response fraction value for each tap event (corrected response = average response \u2013 average background movement). The response of larvae to the stimuli was monitored using the videotracking software and was analyzed using Matlab (Mathworks) and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, United States). Statistical analysis was performed using the Variable Slope log(dose) response curve fitting module of Prism (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA, United States)."

The LEDs were controlled using a custom built driver and software written in BASIC stamp editor. A power meter (1098293, Laser-check, Santa Clara, CA, United States) was used before each experiment to verify uniform light intensity (\u223c400 \u00b5W at the surface of the 96-well plate) and similar red and blue light intensities were used.

Total activity for each larva was monitored for 30 min before and after light onset, with data collected in 10 s bins. Light onset caused a short burst of locomotor activity lasting for \u223c30 s for all genotypes, so data obtained during the minute before and after light onset was excluded from analysis. A large burst of locomotor activity was also observed for all genotypes when the lights were turned off after the 30 min illumination period.

To stimulate Hcrt neurons, a region of interest (ROI) that encompassed the Hcrt neuron soma was illuminated using a 488 nm laser at 100% power. Ten pulses lasting 0.3 s each were applied over 3.2 s using the bleaching function, and then a ROI encompassing a GCaMP6s-expressing LC soma was imaged at 4 Hz for 30 s. The time between the final stimulation pulse and initiation of imaging was less than 0.1 s. This cycle of stimulation and imaging was repeated 8 times for each GCaMP6s-expressing soma. A baseline of 60 s was recorded before the first stimulation. Movies were processed using ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>).

Even in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, it is difficult to interpret the magnitude of the effect because it is not clear what the X-axis is (log base 2, base 10?). The fact that the drug and the mutant effects are similar (even if modest) appears to underscore the conclusion but still\u2026 And if the drug result (3B) is really more impressive than the mutant (1A), what does this do to the dopamine hypothesis? Perhaps the authors could consider that the excess sleep itself lowers the arousal threshold. (Too much sleep; sleep more lightly?). And the more sleep itself is no surprise. Is this possible?"

As suggested by the reviewer, we have added new experiments in which we used the alpha2 agonist clonidine and the beta1 antagonist bopindolol to investigate the role of these receptors in sleep regulation. The main effect of clonidine treatment is a reduction in day activity and increase in day sleep, with no effect in night activity or sleep (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting a day-specific role for alpha2 receptors in sleep regulation. Bopindolol treatment results in reduction of night activity and increase in both day and night sleep (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). Similar to prazosin, clonidine and bopindolol may not activate and inhibit the all alpha2 and all beta receptor paralogs, respectively."

However, pharmacological inactivation of alpha1 receptors with prazosin, activation of the inhibitory alpha2 receptors with clonidine, or inactivation of the beta receptors with bopindolol do not interfere with the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. The ability of bopindolol to recapitulate the reduction in arousal threshold seen in the <i>dbh</i> mutant suggests that this aspect of the mutant phenotype is a consequence of absence of beta-adrenergic receptor signaling. Furthermore, the inability of prazosin (which increases sleep during day and night) and clonidine (which increases sleep during the day) to recapitulate the arousal threshold phenotype suggests that the observed reduction in arousal threshold in <i>dbh</i> mutants is not simply a consequence of excess sleep."

The rationale was to test whether a mutation or a drug treatment differentially affected the behavior of awake larvae (larvae that had moved within the last minute) or asleep larvae (no movement within the last minute). The reason the stimulus was presented every 5 min instead of 1 min was to ensure adequate numbers of asleep fish for each data point. However, this proposition becomes problematic if we expose larvae with very different arousal thresholds to the same stimulus. In other words, even though we present all larvae with a stimulus of the same absolute magnitude, larvae of different genotypes or treated with different drugs can experience a very different subjective stimulus, rendering comparisons among them nonsensical. This limitation became apparent with the improved tapping assay used in the revised manuscript. As a result, we have removed experiments using a 5 minute inter-trial-interval (panels C and D from <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."
