                    "text": "Neuronal activity in sensory and fronto-parietal (FP) areas underlies the representation and attentional control, respectively, of sensory information maintained in visual working memory (VWM). Within these regions, beta/gamma phase-synchronization supports the integration of sensory functions, while synchronization in theta/alpha bands supports the regulation of attentional functions. A key challenge is to understand which mechanisms integrate neuronal processing across these distinct frequencies and thereby the sensory and attentional functions. We investigated whether such integration could be achieved by cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS). Using concurrent magneto- and electroencephalography, we found that CFS was load-dependently enhanced between theta and alpha\u2013gamma and between alpha and beta-gamma oscillations during VWM maintenance among visual, FP, and dorsal attention (DA) systems. CFS also connected the hubs of within-frequency-synchronized networks and its strength predicted individual VWM capacity. We propose that CFS integrates processing among synchronized neuronal networks from theta to gamma frequencies to link sensory and attentional functions."

Within these regions, beta/gamma phase-synchronization supports the integration of sensory functions, while synchronization in theta/alpha bands supports the regulation of attentional functions. A key challenge is to understand which mechanisms integrate neuronal processing across these distinct frequencies and thereby the sensory and attentional functions. We investigated whether such integration could be achieved by cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS). Using concurrent magneto- and electroencephalography, we found that CFS was load-dependently enhanced between theta and alpha\u2013gamma and between alpha and beta-gamma oscillations during VWM maintenance among visual, FP, and dorsal attention (DA) systems. CFS also connected the hubs of within-frequency-synchronized networks and its strength predicted individual VWM capacity. We propose that CFS integrates processing among synchronized neuronal networks from theta to gamma frequencies to link sensory and attentional functions."

Macaque cortical recordings have shown that in beta- (\u03b2, 15\u201330\u2009Hz) and gamma- (\u03b3, 30\u221290\u2009Hz) frequency bands, inter-areal PS is indeed enhanced by the maintenance of visual information in VWM and it has been suggested to support the maintenance of VWM content (<a href=\"#bib77\">Siegel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Salazar et al., 2012</a>). Using MEG and EEG, source-localization, and network analyses (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</a>), we observed that VWM involves large-scale \u03b2- and \u03b3-band PS in the visual and parietal regions as in invasive LFP recordings from monkeys, but also high-alpha(\u03b1)-band (11\u201314\u2009Hz) synchronization in fronto-parietal areas (<a href=\"#bib56\">Palva et al., 2010</a>). This anatomical pattern suggests a putative functional division where \u03b2- and \u03b3-band synchronization underlies the maintenance and integration of visual information while the high-\u03b1-band synchronization supports the coordination of processing among brain regions serving attentional and central executive control. Likewise in MEG, also human intracranial EEG (iEEG) data have revealed long-range phase-synchronization in theta (\u03b8, 4\u20138\u2009Hz), \u03b2, and \u03b3\u00a0bands in hippocampal memory circuits (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fell et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Axmacher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Burke et al., 2013</a>)."

These mechanisms would conceivably also support the emergence of subjectively coherent VWM from sensory and central executive functions. Phase amplitude coupling (PAC) is one form of CFC that has been suggested to underlie cross-frequency integration (<a href=\"#bib57\">Palva et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Palva and Palva, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Sirota et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Canolty and Knight, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</a>). Prior studies have shown that during VWM maintenance, \u03b3 oscillation amplitudes are coupled to \u03b8 phase via PAC in cortical (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sauseng et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Siegel et al., 2009</a>) and hippocampal recordings (<a href=\"#bib1\">Axmacher et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Park et al., 2016</a>). However, PAC is independent of the phase of the fast oscillations and hence cannot promote a consistent temporal and spike-time relationship between the slow and fast oscillations (<a href=\"#bib57\">Palva et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Palva and Palva, 2012</a>), which are essential in the regulation of neuronal communication (<a href=\"#bib78\">Singer, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Fries, 2015</a>)."

CFS could thus mechanistically underlie the cross-frequency integration of synchronized networks at the temporal resolution of the faster oscillation (Fell and Axmacher, 2011; <a href=\"#bib61\">Palva and Palva, 2012</a>) through coordination of consistent spike timing relationships between the oscillations. In CFS, the ratio of high (<i>f</i><sub>high</sub>) and low (<i>f</i><sub>low</sub>) frequencies is defined by the integers <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> so that <i>n\u2219f</i><sub>high</sub> = <i>m\u2219f</i><sub>low</sub>.

However, being limited to the sensor level, these studies leave the cortical sources of CFS as well as its functional significance unclear. A recent study using intracranial EEG (iEEG) also reported behaviorally significant \u03b8:\u03b2 and \u03b8:\u03b3 CFS during VWM in human hippocampus using a serial Stenberg task (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chaieb et al., 2015</a>).

We use here concurrent magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) with individual-anatomy-based source reconstruction and data-driven analyses to investigate the functional significance of CFS in WVM. The key predictions of our postulate are that CFS should be observable and load-dependent in a parametric VWM task (<a href=\"#bib56\">Palva et al., 2010</a>), that it should connect the task-relevant within-frequency-synchronized networks, and finally that it should be predictive of individual behavioral VWM performance. We found solid support for each of these predictions, which shows that CFS may indeed be a mechanism for coordinating the\u00a0neuronal processing and regulating communication among oscillatory networks at different frequencies."

These networks and the most central low- and high-frequency hubs are presented here separately to illustrate the distinct neuroanatomical sources of the most central cortical \u03b8 oscillations (left) and the \u03b1\u2212\u03b3 oscillations (right) connected by this CFS coupling. The complete \u03b8-consistent CFS network is thus the combination of these graphs. Circles represent network vertices (cortical parcels), their size is proportional to their degree centrality, and both vertex and surface colors represent functional brain systems (see colors below). The lighter sector of each vertex represents the fraction of low-frequency connections and the darker section the fraction of high-frequency connections this vertex has in the graph. The width of the edges represents the coupling strength between the two vertices and their color is a mixture of the brain system assignments of the vertices. The dotted lines at the end of the connections point towards the high-frequency (from LF hubs, left panel) or the low-frequency (from HF hubs, right panel) vertices for LF and HF networks, respectively.

We initially averaged the CFS estimates across the six memory-load conditions ('Mean condition') and represented significant differences in CFS between baseline and retention as graphs where cortical areas comprise the vertices and significant connections are edges (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</a>). These task effects on the CFS were indexed at the graph level by connection density, <i>\u039a,</i> that was the proportion of statistically significant inter-areal interactions of all possible pair-wise interactions among the 148 brain areas. Visualizing <i>\u039a</i> as a function of <i>f</i><sub>low</sub> and the frequency ratio 1:<i>m</i> revealed that inter-areal CFS of high-\u03b1 (11\u201314\u2009Hz) with \u03b2- and \u03b3-band oscillations as well as CFS of high-\u03b8-band (5\u22127\u2009Hz) with \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-band oscillations were enhanced above baseline levels for most or all frequency ratios (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, see external source data 1 for statistical information,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib76\">Siebenh\u00fchner et al., 2016</a>). In contrast, CFS of low-\u03b8 (3\u20134\u2009Hz) and low-\u03b1 (7\u221210\u2009Hz) oscillations with their corresponding higher frequency bands was concurrently suppressed below baseline levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>; external source data 1,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib76\">Siebenh\u00fchner et al., 2016</a>). These data hence show that CFS among cortical oscillations is both up- and down-regulated dynamically by VWM maintenance. The horizontal concentration of positive and negative findings across the frequency ratios to consistent lower frequencies (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a and b</a>) suggested that the high-\u03b1 and \u03b8 oscillations were synchronized in a harmonic structure with higher frequency oscillations in \u03b1\u2212\u03b3 bands. We quantified this by comparing the\u00a0harmonic consistency of CFS across frequency ratios against surrogate data (see Materials and methods) and found this consistency to be significant for the enhanced CFS in high-\u03b8 and high-\u03b1 bands and for the suppressed CFS in the low-\u03b1 band (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a and b</a>, <i>p\u00a0</i>&lt;\u00a00.05, FDR corrected). These data thus suggest that \u03b8 and high-\u03b1 oscillations are systematically phase coupled with \u03b2 and \u03b3 networks for which they thus provide temporal framing across a range of frequency ratios."

However, event-related changes in CFS could be attributable to changes in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) caused by task-induced changes in oscillation amplitudes. To rule out this possibility, we obtained source-space parcel-specific estimates of apparent SNR (aSNR) (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and used the event-related and memory-load dependent changes in aSNR to predict the changes in CFS estimates that one would observe in the absence to true changes in phase coupling (<a href=\"#bib56\">Palva et al., 2010</a>) see Materials and\u00a0methods). However, we did not find any systematic relationship between SNR and CFS, and observed that as in similar prior analyses for 1:1 PS (<a href=\"#bib56\">Palva et al., 2010</a>), the observed CFS changes were much larger than those predicted by changes in SNR in both the Mean (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) and Load (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>) conditions. To further corroborate that the observed CFS effects were not attributable to SNR changes in a case where the SNR would be overestimated, we quantified the correlation between the Mean- and Load-condition effects in PLV and oscillation amplitudes for each significant edge, for each ratio, and for each frequency-pair (see Materials and methods). In line with the prior findings, we found that the task effects on oscillation amplitudes were either insignificantly correlated with the CFS effects or, in the few ratio-frequency pairs where a significant correlation was observed, explained only a small fraction of the variance in CFS PLV (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Overall, the pattern of these correlations was far from the pattern of CFS and hence the Mean- and Load-condition CFS effects are unlikely to be explained by concurrent changes in SNR."

For CFS attributable to non-sinudoidal waveforms, these amplitude correlations should exhibit a frequency-ratio pattern similar to that of CFS. However, the observed pattern of CF amplitude correlations was saliently distinct from CFS (<a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7</a>; external source data 2,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib76\">Siebenh\u00fchner et al., 2016</a>) and within each frequency-ratio pair, the vast majority of significant CFS connections did not exhibit significant amplitude-amplitude coupling (<a href=\"#fig3s8\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 8</a>).

We demonstrate here that human VWM maintenance is indeed characterized by large-scale networks of functionally significant CFS among cortical oscillations. We found that CFS was correlated with task demands, predicted individual VWM capacity and connected 1:1-within-frequency synchronization among task-relevant visual and fronto-parietal regions.

Thus 1:2 high-\u03b1 and \u03b2 CFS in SM could reflect these functions during VWM. However, \u03b1:\u03b2 CFS could also be biased by the classical sensory-motor \u03bc\u2212rhythm (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hari and Salmelin, 1997</a>) that is comprised of strongly 1:2 phase coupled a and \u03b2 oscillations (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nikulin and Brismar, 2006</a>). While \u03b1:\u03b3 CFS was largely distinct from \u03b1:\u03b2, also \u03b1:\u03b3 CFS involved SM hubs. Together with the prior fMRI data, this supports the notion that the SM system could be task-relevant in VWM, but further studies are needed to disentangle their functional roles."

Despite DM being often categorized as a task-negative or -irrelevant system, recent studies have shown that neuronal activity in the angular part of iPG is stronger for successfully memorized information (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hutchinson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lee and Kuhl, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Spaniol et al., 2009</a>) while the superior frontal cortex is partly functionally similar to mFG (<a href=\"#bib29\">Fuster, 2008</a>), and thus both these regions could be task-positive in the present VWM task despite belonging to DM during resting state. sTS, on the other hand, is related to multisensory processing (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beauchamp et al., 2004</a>) and verbal WM functions (<a href=\"#bib87\">Tanabe et al., 2005</a>) and its presence in the CSF networks might be attributable to verbal rehearsal during the memory maintenance even though the present cohort was instructed not to verbalize the task. Overall, given that CFS was predominantly observed among the visual and attentional systems, we suggest that these findings reflect task-positive roles of these brain regions rather than CFS being a phenomenon characteristic to task-negative processing during VWM."

The suppression involved network hubs predominantly in the SM and DM systems and at the systems-level, disengaged DA and SM from DM and FP. The DM system is widely thought to support non-task-oriented processing (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fox et al., 2009</a>), which suggests that the suppression of CFS there could represent the disengagement of task-irrelevant brain regions and networks, even though some parts of DM could be task-positive in VWM (see above). Low-\u03b1 consistent suppression of CFS with the concurrent increase in the high-\u03b1 consistent CFS among visual and FP systems may also reflect the disengagement of neuronal processing in a task-irrelevant frequency band from that in a task-relevant band. Overall, the task-negative and -positive patterns of CFS hierarchies over the low- and high-\u03b1 bands, respectively, suggest that \u03b1 oscillations support both the coordination of behaviorally relevant (<a href=\"#bib59\">Palva and Palva, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Palva et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Saalmann et al., 2012</a>) and the disengagement of task-irrelevant neuronal processes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Klimesch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</a>) as suggested previously.

The strength of CFS was dynamically up- and down-regulated, correlated with VWM task demands, and predictive of individual VWM capacity, which show that CFS is a functionally significant cross-frequency interaction mechanism during VWM maintenance. CFS hierarchies can thus be dynamically recruited to meet cognitive processing demands. The present data are in line with the notions that CFS integrates neuronal processing and regulates neuronal communication among spectrally and anatomically distributed cortical networks and that CFS could thereby support the integration of attentional and representational functions of VWM."

In the task, 12 right-handed subjects (age 28 \u00b1 3, mean \u00b1 SD, 4 females) memorized a Sample stimulus comprising one to six randomly located squares of different colors and after a 1 s retention period answered whether the test display was the same or different as the sample stimuli and whether they were sure about the responses. Subjects were instructed not to use verbal rehearsal during memorization. A total of ~1800 trials (~300 per memory load of 1\u22126 objects) were collected from each subject. Cortical activity was measured with concurrent EEG (60-channel) and MEG data (204 planar gradiometers and 102 magnetometers, Elekta Neuromag Ltd., Helsinki, Finland) recordings at 600\u2009Hz sampling rate. Ocular signals were measured with electro-oculogram (EOG) and the behavioral thumb-twitch responses with electromyography (EMG). Only artifact-free trials with valid behavioral responses were included in the analysis. One subject was excluded from the analysis due to too large differences in head position between recording sessions. T1-weighted anatomical MRI scans for cortical surface reconstruction models were obtained at a resolution of 1x1x1\u2009mm with a 1.5\u2009T MRI scanner (Siemens, Germany).

To reconstruct ongoing cortical phase-time series, the filtered complex single-trial M/EEG time series were inverse transformed (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>) to source-vertex time series that were then collapsed (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>) into time series of cortical parcels in a 400-parcel collection (see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This parcellation was obtained by iteratively splitting the largest parcels of the Destrieux atlas along their most elongated axis using the same parcel-wise splits for all subjects (<a href=\"#bib56\">Palva et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Rouhinen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Honkanen et al., 2015</a>). Using neuroanatomical labeling as the anatomical 'coordinate system' made inter-subject morphing in group-level analyses unnecessary, which would have compromised the individual anatomical accuracy. Collapsing the source time-series into time-series of cortical parcels was performed with optimized collapse operators where only the source vertices with greatest source reconstruction accuracy were used (<a href=\"#bib42\">Korhonen et al., 2014</a>). For creating the collapse operators, we used forward and inverse modeling of simulated data to assess the source reconstruction accuracy for each source vertex and cortical parcel separately for each subject. In these simulations, Morlet-filtered white noise was created independently for each cortical parcel and these time series together were forward modeled to simulate the M/EEG recording of ongoing brain activity with known source dynamics. Inverse modeling and parcel time series collapsing, carried out identically to the inverse modeling of real data, was then applied to the simulated M/EEG data to reconstruct the spatial correlation patterns attributable to signal mixing in M/EEG data acquisition and source reconstruction. Comparison of the original parcel time series with the forward-inverse modeled source-vertex time series was then used to identify for each parcel the collection source vertices that most accurately reconstruct the original parcel time series (<a href=\"#bib42\">Korhonen et al., 2014</a>)."

We assessed the reliability of data based on phase correlations between real and simulated data. <i>Parcel fidelity</i> (<i>f</i>) was defined as the phase correlation between the original true parcel time series and the forward-inverse modeled parcel time series (<a href=\"#bib42\">Korhonen et al., 2014</a>). <i>Parcel cross-talk (c</i>), conversely, was taken as the phase correlation between the forward-inverse modeled parcel time series with the original true time series of all other parcels. For each parcel, we calculated <i>c</i> as the average of <i>f</i> values with all other parcels. Fidelity hence measures the parcel reconstruction accuracy and parcel cross-talk summarizes the degree of mixing a given parcel has with other parcels. <i>Parcel spread (s)</i> for each parcel <i>p</i> was calculated as the mean <i>f</i> of all other parcels with the original time series of parcel <i>p</i> and hence reveals parcels generating signals that are spuriously picked up by many other parcels.

While 1:1 PLV estimates may be biased by residual linear mixing after source reconstruction, neither the long-range couplings nor the strengthening of 1:1 PLVs during the retention period can be attributed to linear mixing. To assess the statistical significance, we computed the 99th% -ile of the PLV distribution of 1000 realizations of surrogate data.

This edge clustering was performed so that an edge-edge adjacency matrix was created and the adjacency was defined to be the product of corresponding maximum parcel cross-talk <i>c</i> (see previous paragraph). Thus each element in the edge-edge adjacency matrix indicates the proximity of any two observed edges in terms of linear mixing attributable to data acquisition and inverse modeling on the group level. Here high adjacency indicates a high probability that these edges actually represent the same underlying cortico-cortical interaction. Hierarchical clustering of the edge-edge adjacency matrix thus groups all observed edges into a set of hyperedges that are mutually dissociable in the MEG linear mixing space. To achieve a representation of connectivity shared by multiple frequency ratios, we used permutation statistics to test for each hyperedge whether it could be significantly (p&lt;0.05, uncorrected) attributable to edges from any single ratio. Then those hyperedges for which this was the case were excluded from further visualization. The remaining hyperedges were then 'flattened' into a regular adjacency matrix by summing the shared edges across ratios."

The vertices were coloured by the functional brain system (<a href=\"#bib92\">Yeo et al., 2011</a>) they belonged to. As many vertices would be both at the high and low-frequency 'end' of connections within a graph, we chose to indicate their fractions of LF and HF degree by the light and darker shaded sectors. For example, a vertex with 3 connections where it was at the LF 'end' and one where it was at the HF 'end' would be divided into 75% area of lighter and 25% area of darker shade. CFS connections were indicated by lines where dashed ends pointed towards the high-frequency vertices in LF graphs and towards low-frequency vertices in HF graphs.

With these networks, we tested whether the vertex centralities (represented by vertex degree) of the low-frequency (<i>f<sub>low</sub></i>) CFS network vertices were correlated with centrality values for the vertices of the corresponding slow 1:1 networks. Conversely, we tested whether the vertices of the high-frequency (<i>f<sub>high</sub></i>) part of the CFS networks were correlated with the vertices of fast 1:1 networks. Finding such correlations would indicate that CFS connects the major nodes of spectrally distinct within-frequency synchronized networks.

In the Mean condition, we computed the average PLV difference between retention period and baseline time windows over subjects and conditions. In the load condition, we correlated the PLV values in the\u00a0retention period with the object load across subjects. We then morphed these data from the 400-parcel to the coarser 148-parcel Destrieux parcellation. In the same manner, we computed for each frequency and ratio the Mean and Load effects for the measured parcel amplitudes, averaged these amplitude effects for each parcel pair, and morphed to the Destrieux parcellation. For both Mean and Load condition, we then computed the correlation coefficient <i>r</i> between the PLV and amplitude effect for all parcel pairs that were found to have a significant PLV effect in the corresponding group analysis. We compared these <i>r</i> against 1000 surrogate datasets where the amplitude values were randomly shifted across edge pairs. We considered the PLV-effect vs. amplitude-effect correlation significant if the <i>r</i> was in the highest or lowest 2.5%-ile of the surrogate values. No multiple comparison corrections were applied across the studied frequency-ratio pairs. In <a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>, we illustrate the fraction of variance in PLV effects explained by the amplitude effects with <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>values for those ratios and frequencies that had a significant correlation between the PLV and amplitude effects and initially had K &gt; 0.1% in the group analysis."

The authors correctly point out potential confounding of cross-frequency synchrony (CFS) by changes in signal-to-noise ratio due to task-induced changes in oscillations amplitudes. However, the reported control analysis of amplitude-amplitude coupling does not address this confound, because it tests for changes in power co-variance, but not for changes in the mean power between baseline and memory intervals. However, any change in power, and thus SNR, of merely one of two analyzed nodes is expected to yield a spurious change in measured CFS even without any true change in underlying CFS. Critically, one may observe spurious decreases and increases depending on the relative strength of CFS and amplitude changes for signal and noise components. In previous analyses of the same data, the authors reported amplitude changes during visual working memory (Palva et al., J Neurosci 2011) that were load-dependent and performance-predictive just like the CFS effects reported here. It should be ruled out that the present CFS results reflect spurious effects driven by these amplitude changes. E.g., the authors should directly compare CFS and amplitude effects and may stratify the data for potential amplitude changes before quantifying CFS."

The description of CFS networks (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; Results section) stresses the claimed link between executive (FP, DA) and visual networks. However, this does not become clear from <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and 6. E.g., it is stated that FP high-\u03b1 connects to visual \u03b3, or more generally, that theta and high-\u03b1 consistent CFS connects the visual system with FP and DA networks. This is neither readily apparent from <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> nor from <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. In fact, in contrast to what is stressed in the text, there seem to be hardly any visual hubs in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. At the same time, the sensorimotor network, which the authors refer to as putatively task-irrelevant, consistently shows up in CFS networks (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), but this is not discussed. Similarly, the authors suggest CFS suppression of task-irrelevant SM and DM networks, but do not mention that CFS was also suppressed in putatively task-relevant DA and FP networks (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, 4th matrix). The description of networks should be clarified and inconsistencies with the hypothesis should be pointed out. It may also help to simplify or split the network display of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>, which convey a lot of information, but are hard to parse."

This seems to be a robust observation, as subsequent figures collapse over many frequency pairs from 1:2 or 3:9. I think this is what they refer to as harmonic consistency. But the interpretation is not very clear; I think it means that the coupling is actually with fast broadband fluctuations and they are only measuring these fluctuations at a limited number of sampled frequency points. If these reflect rhythmic interactions, the authors would need to show that there are separated spectral peaks at each integer multiple. I wouldn't consider low frequencies coupled to broadband fluctuations a \"confound\" (I guess the authors wouldn't either), but the interpretation of phase-phase oscillatory synchronization is quite different from the interpretation of phase-broadband coupling."

In contrast, for this confound, also any neuronal signals not of interest (and likely without CFS) should be considered noise. In particular, this noise entails broad band (1/f) activity, which constitutes a major part of the measured neuronal signal. For any frequency band, the measured neuronal signal does not only reflect oscillatory and potentially CFS-coupled signals of interest, but typically even more strongly broad-band neuronal activity. Thus, the employed SNR estimates are likely grossly overestimated. In turn, the CFS effects predicted from amplitude changes are likely underestimated. In light of this consideration, the authors' statement that predicted and observed CFS effect were not correlated is particularly important, because this would provide evidence against an SNR confound irrespective of incorrect SNR estimates. I suggest to report corresponding statistics to substantiate this claim. Furthermore, it should be clarified why the analysis is restricted to 200 parcels with strongest CFS effects."

The authors correctly point out potential confounding of cross-frequency synchrony (CFS) by changes in signal-to-noise ratio due to task-induced changes in oscillations amplitudes. However, the reported control analysis of amplitude-amplitude coupling does not address this confound, because it tests for changes in power co-variance, but not for changes in the mean power between baseline and memory intervals. However, any change in power, and thus SNR, of merely one of two analyzed nodes is expected to yield a spurious change in measured CFS even without any true change in underlying CFS. Critically, one may observe spurious decreases and increases depending on the relative strength of CFS and amplitude changes for signal and noise components. In previous analyses of the same data, the authors reported amplitude changes during visual working memory (Palva et al., J Neurosci 2011) that were load-dependent and performance-predictive just like the CFS effects reported here. It should be ruled out that the present CFS results reflect spurious effects driven by these amplitude changes.

The retention period amplitudes were often suppressed below baseline levels while synchrony was strengthened and in cases of changes to the same direction, the SNR-predicted changes of synchrony were approximately ten times smaller than the observed changes in synchrony. This disparity suggested that even the reverse cause-and-effect could be plausible: perhaps the local consequences of changes in inter-areal synchronization were driving the observed changes in amplitudes rather than vice versa."

To increase accuracy, we first obtained new SNR estimates so that instead of using sensor-space SNR (as in 2010), we now have local, parcel-by-parcel defined source-space SNR estimates. We thus have accurate SNR estimates for the baseline and retention period time windows of every parcel and frequency band separately for each VWM load condition. Hence the local SNR changes caused by the observed event-related and memory-load dependent amplitude changes could be accurately predicted. We then used the known relationship between changes in PLV and changes in SNR to predict the changes in CFS-PLV from the observed amplitude/SNR changes in these data. We found for CFS that, similarly to 1:1 phase coupling, the observed changes in PLV could not be explained by changes in SNR. Moreover, because the SNR changes were essentially uncorrelated with the PLV changes, this conclusion is robust also against systematic over- or underestimations of SNR.

With LF and HF hubs and their respective connections in separate figures, the complete picture is only obtained when looking at both of these figures and also at the line ends in addition to the hubs. We illustrate the graphs so that, in the LF-part, the hubs are the greatest LF hubs (parcels with most CFS connected low-frequency oscillations) while the dashed ends of the connection lines indicate brain area the hub is connected to, i.e., the area of the faster oscillation. The opposite scheme is then used for the HF part. For example in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, the left column (LF) shows that high-\u03b1 CFS-hubs are robust in the FP (blue circles) and are strongly connected to \u03b3 oscillations in the visual system (reddish or purple edges with dash lines ending to the visual cortex). Conversely, the right column (HF) shows that \u03b3 CFS-hubs are robust in DA (yellow), DM (grey), and visual (red circles) system, and are coupled to \u03b1 oscillations, e.g., in frontal cortex (dashed line ends). Hence, because these figures disambiguate both ends (low- and high frequency) of the most central CFS connections, it can be seen that CFS connects \u03b1 oscillations in FP and superior frontal sulcus/gyrus with \u03b3 oscillations, e.g., in DA and visual system. Understanding the CFS network architecture would be essentially impossible if the LF and HF parts of the CFS networks were presented in the same graph"

In contrast, for this confound, also any neuronal signals not of interest (and likely without CFS) should be considered noise. In particular, this noise entails broad band (1/f) activity, which constitutes a major part of the measured neuronal signal. For any frequency band, the measured neuronal signal does not only reflect oscillatory and potentially CFS-coupled signals of interest, but typically even more strongly broad-band neuronal activity. Thus, the employed SNR estimates are likely grossly overestimated. In turn, the CFS effects predicted from amplitude changes are likely underestimated. In light of this consideration, the authors' statement that predicted and observed CFS effect were not correlated is particularly important, because this would provide evidence against an SNR confound irrespective of incorrect SNR estimates. I suggest to report corresponding statistics to substantiate this claim. Furthermore, it should be clarified why the analysis is restricted to 200 parcels with strongest CFS effects.</i> "
