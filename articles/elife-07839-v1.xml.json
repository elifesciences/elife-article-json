We generated mice with a heterozygous germline deletion of a 2 Mb interval of chromosome band <i>5A3</i> syntenic to a commonly deleted segment of human <i>7q22</i>, and show that mutant hematopoietic cells exhibit cardinal features of MDS. Specifically, the long-term hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment is expanded in <i>5A3<sup>+/del</sup></i> mice, and the distribution of myeloid progenitors (MP) is altered. <i>5A3<sup>+/del</sup></i> HSCs are defective for lymphoid repopulating potential and show a myeloid lineage output bias. These cell autonomous abnormalities are exacerbated by physiologic aging and upon serial transplantation. The <i>5A3</i> deletion partially rescues defective repopulation in <i>Gata2</i> mutant mice. <i>5A3<sup>+/del</sup></i> hematopoietic cells exhibit decreased expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, and perturbed oxygen consumption.
