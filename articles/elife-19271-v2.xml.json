Here we present the first <i>in vitro</i> study of the Min system in fully confined three-dimensional chambers that are lithography-defined, lipid-bilayer coated and isolated through pressure valves. We identify three typical dynamical behaviors that occur dependent on the geometrical chamber parameters: pole-to-pole oscillations, spiral rotations, and traveling waves. We establish the geometrical selection rules and show that, surprisingly, Min-protein spiral rotations govern the larger part of the geometrical phase diagram. Confinement as well as an elevated temperature reduce the characteristic wavelength of the Min patterns, although even for confined chambers with a bacterial-level viscosity, the patterns retain a ~5 times larger wavelength than <i>in vivo</i>. Our results provide an essential experimental base for modeling of intracellular Min gradients in bacterial cell division as well as, more generally, for understanding pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems."

These proteins move back and forth between the two ends of the parent cell so that the levels of Min proteins are highest at the ends and lowest in the middle.

Though it was commonly assumed that it binds the membrane only in its ATP-bound form (<a href=\"#bib8\">de Boer et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hu and Lutkenhaus, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lackner et al., 2003</a>), a recent work showed that MinD can also bind the membrane in the ADP-bound form (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>). (ii) MinE, a protein that is recruited to the membrane by MinD (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ma et al., 2003</a>), upon which it induces MinD\u2019s ATPase activity causing MinD to be released from the membrane (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hu et al., 2002</a>). Subsequently, while diffusing in the cytosol, an exchange of ADP to ATP occurs, and the MinD proteins re-enter the cycle by rebinding the membrane. Several authors showed that MinE can persist on the membrane after MinD detachment (<a href=\"#bib32\">Loose et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Park et al., 2011</a>) or can even interact with the membrane by itself (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hsieh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shih et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>). The exact contribution of this process to the overall Min dynamics remains unclear. Finally, (iii) MinC protein is also recruited to the membrane by MinD, but, due to overlap binding with MinE, is released from MinD after MinE binding (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ma et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wu et al., 2011</a>). While MinC is the sole member of the system that directly interacts with the division apparatus (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hu et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cordell et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dajkovic et al., 2008</a>), it is believed to be only a passive hitchhiker that does not determine the dynamical behavior of the system. Thus, only MinD and MinE are needed in order to form dynamical pole-to-pole oscillations in <i>E. coli</i> cells."

When cells were grown as filaments, a dynamic series of Min bands with a characteristic length of \u223c8\u00a0\u00b5m was observed (<a href=\"#bib46\">Raskin and de Boer, 1999</a>). When the filamentous cells were grown at different temperatures, this length scale did not change but the temporal period of the oscillations decreased according to an Arrhenius law (<a href=\"#bib60\">Touhami et al., 2006</a>). Likewise, in oval-shape cells, the Min system preferentially oscillated along the longest axis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Corbin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shih et al., 2005</a>). Interestingly, while in round <math id=\"inf1\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi></math>MreB cells, the Min oscillation occurred, in the majority of the cases, from one end of the cell to the other in a well-defined manner, in rounded rodA-amber-mutation cells, the oscillation direction moved chaotically from one spot along the membrane to another. A similar mode of chaotic oscillations was also observed when cells adopted aberrant shapes upon getting squeezed into slits smaller than their natural width (<a href=\"#bib44\">M\u00e4nnik et al., 2012</a>). In addition, when <i>E. coli</i> cells were mutated to form a Y shape, a sequence of oscillation nodes along the cell arms was observed that depended on the relative length of the Y shape arms (<a href=\"#bib64\">Varma et al., 2008</a>). These results show that the Min system can adapt to the cell geometry and modify its dynamical behavior accordingly. Indeed, in a recent example, Wu et al. sculpted <i>E. coli</i> cells into various rectangular and square shapes. They found that the Min system behavior was characterized by a typical length scale of 3\u20136\u00a0\u00b5m. In addition, they showed that the choice for a particular Min pattern was governed by the symmetries of the cell shape, its aspect ratio, and its size. Consequentially, a variety of Min patterns were observed, including rotational, transversal, and longitudinal modes (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wu et al., 2015</a>)."

On two-dimensional (2D) SLBs that are much larger than the typical length scale of the Min patterns, instead of oscillations, the Min proteins exhibit patterns that can be grouped into two classes: rotating spirals and traveling waves. In general, traveling waves were formed when bands that emanated from two counter-rotating spirals collided. Importantly, the wavelength of the traveling waves was very large, between 65\u2013100\u00a0\u00b5m, and depended on the ratio of MinD to MinE concentration. Thus, when the Min system is reconstituted <i>in vitro</i>, it exhibits a pattern-formation behavior with a typical spatial dimension that is about an order of magnitude larger than the one observed <i>in vivo</i>. Interestingly, when the Min system was reconstituted under limiting concentration conditions, unique patterns, in particular a bursting type, were observed (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vecchiarelli et al., 2016</a>). It was suggested that these patterns might be more closely related to the behavior of the Min system <i>in vivo</i>."

For example, when rectangular patches of flat surface SLB were separated one from the other with gold barriers that were much larger than the characteristic size of the Min dynamics <i>in vitro</i> (\u223c100\u00a0\u03bcm), Min waves propagated in a direction that depended on the aspect ratio of the patch (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schweizer et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, Min waves can be oriented within an SLB if parallel grooves are molded into the surface (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zieske et al., 2014</a>). However, the geometry-selection rules that were found in these <i>in vitro</i> experiments do not correspond to the ones that were observed <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wu et al., 2015</a>). Recently, utilizing partly confined fabricated reaction chambers, Zieske and Schwille were able to reproduce Min pole-to-pole oscillations as well as double and triple-band standing waves, similar to the patterns observed in filamentous <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zieske and Schwille, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2014</a>). Similarly, Zieske et al. showed that when grooves had a shape similar to that of dividing bacteria at the last division stage, the Min proteins stochastically distributed between the two sides of the grooves. This observation is similar to the way that Min proteins are distributed between the two progenies of an <i>E. coli</i> mother cell (<a href=\"#bib9\">Di Ventura and Sourjik, 2011</a>). However, these <i>in vitro</i> Min oscillations were stable only when the groove width was much smaller than the <i>in vitro</i> wavelength of the waves. Since the geometrical selection rules of the Min patterns that were established in sculpted cells (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wu et al., 2015</a>) do not coincide with the ones that were established for the <i>in vitro</i> grooves, the exact relation between the underlying mechanisms of these two phenomena of Min proteins remains unclear."

Several experimental attempts have been made to study these reaction-diffusion factors. For example, when the overall bulk diffusivity of the proteins was decreased by a factor of 10, the Min wavelength was, surprisingly, only marginally reduced (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schweizer et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, when the Min dynamics was studied on the outer side of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), both the wavelength and wave velocity increased considerably relative to the behavior on an SLB (<a href=\"#bib38\">Martos et al., 2013</a>). It was suggested that the 4-fold increase in the diffusion rate of the Min protein on the GUVs membrane was responsible for this phenomenon. Concerning the reaction rates, by increasing the salt concentration or the ratio of anionic to natural phospholipids, Vecchiarelli et al. observed a reduction in the size of the Min bands (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</a>), which they attributed to the different affinity of MinE to the membrane under these conditions. Similarly, Zieske and Schwille observed a decreased wavelength to a value of about 25\u00a0\u00b5m by increasing the concentration of a negatively charged lipid, cardiolipin, in the SLB to an (unphysiologically high) molar ratio of 70%\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib74\">Zieske and Schwille, 2014</a>).

Each of them postulated a somewhat different molecular mechanism and was able to reproduce several of the observed Min phenomena for certain values of the model\u2019s parameters. However, the ability to explain all Min behaviors and the robustness to changes in the parameters was less well considered. In particular, the ability to gap the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> behavior of the system was not given much attention. Recently, Bonny et al. claimed that they were able to bridge this gulf (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bonny et al., 2013</a>). However, they were only able to reproduce the <i>in vivo</i> oscillations and <i>in vitro</i> surface waves for reaction parameters that were different in both cases over several orders of magnitudes, and the experimental basis for this variation remained unclear. To date, the best Min model was developed by Halatek and Frey, based on a previous model by Huang and Wingreen (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Halatek and Frey, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Thalmeier et al., 2016</a>). This model is able to reproduce most of the <i>in vivo</i> experimental results over a wide range of geometries and conditions (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wu et al., 2015</a>). The ability of this model to reproduce the Min behavior <i>in vitro</i> was, however, not yet reported."

First steps in this direction were taken by Zieske and Schwille (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zieske and Schwille, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2014</a>). However, their compartment were only semi-confined and they probed the system behavior mainly for compartments that were much narrower than the typical Min wavelength, and hence, a full description of the geometrical selection rules for the Min system in confined chambers, and especially the relation between <i>in vitro</i> oscillations and <i>in vitro</i> traveling waves, is still missing."

To obtained these chambers and encapsulate Min proteins inside them, we fabricated PDMS chips and coated all the chamber walls with SLB before injecting the Min proteins and spatially isolating the chambers from the rest of the chip through soft-lithography PDMS valves. We determine the Min patterns as a function of the geometrical factors of the chambers as well as of other factors such as temperature and viscosity, and compared these results to the one that are observed with flat SLB. We show that the rotational Min spirals can evolve to pole-to-pole oscillations if the dimensions of the confinement are reduced or to traveling waves if the dimensions of the confinement are increased. We provide a phase diagram that maps out the Min patterns over a wide range of geometrical parameters. In addition, we show that several parameters, including 3D confinement, medium viscosity and temperature can reduce the wavelength of traveling waves. Yet, all these parameters did not resolve the <i>in vitro</i>/<i>in vivo</i> dichotomy. Our comprehensive set of data, however, provides essential information that is needed in order to understand the molecular mechanism of the Min system, which underlies its essential pattern-formation abilities."

After the device was flushed with SUVs and incubated for \u223c1 hr, a nice continuous SLB was formed on all the inner walls of the chambers (data not shown).

For several devices, we checked the formation of a fluid SLB using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (data not shown); for other devices, we relied on the homogeneous fluorescence signal of the TopFluor cardiolipin. It was important, for each device, to check that the valves worked properly. As a quality control, we checked the functionality of the valves by operating them during the first stages of the washing process and observing the effect on the flow through the microchambers (see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and the Materials and methods section).

The application of buffer flow resulted in migration of the SUVs that did not splash during the previous incubation period on the chambers walls along the stream lines. After \u223c3 min the valves were closed and the flow was stopped (red traffic light). This resulted in an immediate halt of the SUVs flow, showing that the chambers were isolated from the rest of the chip.

Immediately upon releasing the pressure in the pressure valves, the SUVs started to flow again, showing that the halting of the flow was the result of the valves operation and did not result from, say, stopping the syringe pump operation. Of course, stopping the operation of the syringe pump will also result in a halt of the flow in the microfluidic device.

Three primary dynamical behaviors stood out as the most prominent patterns; (i) pole-to-pole oscillations - where the Min proteins periodically move back and forth from one side of a structure to the other (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>); (ii) traveling waves - where the proteins move constantly from one side of a structure to the opposite side (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>); and (iii) spiral rotations - where the proteins constantly rotate in a spiral fashion within the microchamber (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>).

In addition, a zoom-in for the smaller chambers sizes is shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. In this atlas of dynamical patterns, one can observe a variety of patterns, e.g., side-to-side oscillations in the 30\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0\u00b5m chamber, a traveling wave in the 60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0\u00b5m chamber, and a spiral rotation in the 40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040\u00a0\u00b5m chamber. More complex dynamical patterns were also observed. For example, in chambers of size 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0\u00b5m and 60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0\u00b5m, instead of the most simple side-to-side oscillation, we observed a striped pattern, where the Min concentration oscillated back and forth from the center of the chamber to both sides (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is similar to what has been observed in filamentous cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Raskin and de Boer, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Touhami et al., 2006</a>), shaped long cells (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wu et al., 2015</a>), and <i>in vitro</i> grooves (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zieske and Schwille, 2014</a>). Furthermore, in some cases we observed more than one rotational center within a single microchamber, a behavior that can be seen in the 40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0\u00b5m, 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0\u00b5m, 60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0\u00b5m\u00a0and 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030\u00a0\u00b5m chambers."

Altogether we analyzed the dynamical behavior of the Min proteins in 553 different chambers. For each chamber that was recorded, we identified to what class of dynamical behaviors the observed pattern conform to: (i) oscillations. (ii) traveling waves, or (iii) rotations. Cases with more than one rotational center in the chamber where tagged as rotations and cases of striped or side-to-side oscillations where tagged as oscillations. The large majority of observed patterns (&gt;95%) could be readily classified in these three categories. Naturally, there exist some borderline cases between the three types. For example, we observed that a rotational center of the Min proteins could propagate from one side of the chamber to the other. This behavior was grouped under the tag of traveling waves."

The results are shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a\u2013c</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>. As can be seen, clear relations exist between the geometry of the chamber and the observed dynamical Min behavior. We note a few particular features: (i) Rotational patterns appear as the majority for chambers with small aspect ratio (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). As the chamber aspect ratio increases, the probability to obtain rotational behavior decreases, and for chambers with an aspect ratio larger than 2.8, we hardly observed rotational behavior in our chambers. (ii) Oscillatory behavior predominantly appears when the chamber width is small (\u223c10\u00a0\u00b5m) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). (iii) Traveling waves mainly appear if the chamber length is relatively large (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>), and their prevalence increases as the chamber length increases. Similarly, if the chamber area is relatively large the prevalence of obtaining a traveling waves increases (see. <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). For these large areas, the confined chambers reflect the surface waves that were observed on unbound SLBs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Loose et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</a>). The clear relation found between the chamber geometry and the dynamical Min patterns unambiguously proves that confinement sets the rules for Min pattern formation. It also supports the notion that the existence of the connector lines in our setup adds only second-order effects. Thus, by using the soft fabricated valves, we were able to extract and study, for the first time, the geometrical selection rules of the Min system in truly confined 3D structures <i>in vitro</i>."

In this phase diagram, each tile represents, in its color, the most prevalent Min behavior for the chambers with the designated specific dimensions. We restricted ourselves to cases for which we had data from at least 4 different chambers with this specific geometry; the typical number are 20\u201330 chambers per tile, see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for the exact numbers. As can be seen from <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, the phase diagram is nicely separated into three different regions: (i) The majority pattern is rotations; (ii) oscillations are the most prevalent pattern in narrow chambers, in line with previous observation in semi-3D-confined structures (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zieske and Schwille, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2014</a>); and (iii) as expected (<a href=\"#bib33\">Loose et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2011a</a>), the most prevalent behavior for large and long chambers is that of traveling waves. The relative percentage of the oscillations, rotations and traveling waves is presented respectively in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b\u2013d</a>. The most striking, and unexpected, result of this study is that in fully confined 3D chambers, a large part of the phase diagram is occupied by rotational behavior, i.e., Min patterns that rotate around a fixed point in a spiral fashion. In other words, confining the Min system in 3D chambers mainly results in the formation of spiral waves. When the chambers becomes too narrow, these rotational centers are less stable, presumably due to reflection of the Min concentration front from the chamber boundaries, and oscillations are formed. Oscillations thus appear to be a derivative phenomenon that results from destabilization of spiral rotating patterns by the chamber walls. In the other extreme, for very large areas, the interaction between multiple rotational centers will equilibrate in such a way that the stable behavior becomes a traveling wave."

                                "text": "Theoretical models of the Min system rely on the concentration of the MinD and MinE proteins as an important control parameter. Determining the exact concentrations in the microchambers needs some considerations and is less trivial than it may appear to be at first glance. While Min proteins were injected at a well-defined concentration (1\u00a0\u00b5M MinE and 1.08\u00a0\u00b5M MinD), the final concentration of the proteins in the chambers are higher than those introduced. The reason is that during the injection process, MinD molecules will bind the membrane, followed by MinE molecules, while proteins continue to flow into the chamber with the fresh bulk solution. This results in larger final concentration in steady state. We therefore measured the concentration of the final Min proteins inside our chambers using a green fluorescence protein (GFP) calibration. We measured the relative fluorescence of GFP, MinD-Cy3, and MinE-Cy5 in bulk using a fluorometer, yielding a calibration curve of intensity versus concentrations. Next, we injected the regular Min proteins mixture, which contains MinD-Cy3 and MinE-Cy5, together with GFP into the chambers, and measured the resulted fluorescence of the two labeled proteins verses that of GFP on a widefield microscope with a 20X objective. From that, one can infer the actual concentrations (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013c</a> for the fluorometer calibration curves and the Materials and methods section for the detailed derivation of Min proteins concentration in the chambers). Note that since GFP does not bind the membrane, its concentration in the microchambers is always known. Thus, it can be used as a calibration reference to estimate the concentration of the Min proteins by comparing their relative fluorescence in the microchamber to the relative fluorescence for the case where there is no membrane binding (i.e. in the fluorometer cavity)."

As can be seen (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>), the actual concentration of the Min proteins in our chambers was significantly (\u223cfactor 5 higher than the value for the injected stock solution. Furthermore, a wide distribution is observed, particularly for MinE. Note that we did not observe a relation between the chamber size and the measured concentration of the Min proteins. From these measurements we concluded that the concentration of MinD in our chambers was 4.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b5M (mean \u00b1 SD), the concentration of MinE 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0\u00b5M, and the average ratio of [MinE]/[MinD] amounted to 1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5."

This question is interesting since, as mentioned in the introduction, one of the open questions regarding the Min system relates to the differences between its spatial length scale <i>in vitro</i> verses <i>in vivo</i>. Mean and SD of the measured wavelength of 35 traveling-waves in confined chambers are shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>. We measured a wavelength of 43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0\u00b5M at room temperature. This value is significantly lower than the wavelength of 78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0\u00b5M (n\u00a0=\u00a030 for traveling waves that we measured on 2D flat SLBs using the exact same protein and lipid composition of the SLB as was used in our microchambers experiments.

                                "text": "We examined the effects of molecular crowding on the characteristics of the waves in our 3D confined chambers. Crowding the liquid environment can have multiple effects. On the one hand, it increases the viscosity of the solution, thus, by Einstein\u2019s relation, reducing the diffusivity of the proteins. This parameter is particularly important in reaction-diffusion processes, such as the Min dynamics, since the diffusion rate of the fastest species determines the distance between two maxima of the pattern. On the other hand, the use of a high concentration of molecular crowder (polymers or proteins) can have unintended side effects and influence the stability and binding properties of the studied proteins themselves (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kuznetsova et al., 2014</a>). In order to maximize the viscosity of the solution while minimizing the side effects, we employed a solution of 4% PEG 8000, 4% Ficol 400, and 4% BSA (all three commonly used crowders). The measured viscosity of this solution is 9.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0cP, i.e., one order of magnitude larger than that of water. Though the exact viscosity inside <i>E. coli</i> cells is unknown, this value is close to the estimated one (<a href=\"#bib61\">Trovato and Tozzini, 2014</a>). The results (n\u00a0=\u00a017) for the wavelength and wave velocity of traveling Min waves in confined 3D chambers under these conditions are shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a\u00a0and\u00a0b</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for examples of Min waves under viscous conditions. Increasing the viscosity of the environment resulted in a factor 2 reduction of the wavelength from 43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0\u00b5m to 23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0\u00b5m. This reduction in the wavelength is comparable to the reduction in wavelength that was observed by Martos et al. in the presence of 140\u00a0g/l Ficol (<a href=\"#bib39\">Martos et al., 2015</a>). Next to the reduction in the wavelength, we observed a very large decrease, of more than one order of magnitude, in the wave velocity from 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u00b5m to 0.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.014\u00a0\u00b5m/s. Note that this substantial decrease in the velocity is much larger than what was observed by Martos et al. and is probably related to the different constellations of 2D surfaces (used by Martos et al.) in comparison to 3D confined microchambers (in this work)."

As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d\u2013f</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>, the geometry selection properties of the Min system at the elevated temperature of 37\u00b0C are very similar to those that were observed at room temperature (n\u00a0=\u00a0198): (i) at low aspect ratio of the chambers (L/W), the prevalence to obtain rotational patterns is high while it decreases as the aspect ratio increases; (ii) oscillatory behavior is observed mainly for narrow chambers; (iii) traveling waves become dominant for long and large chambers.

This contrasts the behavior of waves on flat 2D SLBs surfaces, for which we observed a much more profound effect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>, n\u00a0=\u00a027). In this case the wavelength reduced from 78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012 at room temperature to 48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0\u00b5m at 37\u00b0C.

This compares to v\u00a0=\u00a01.4\u00a0\u00b5m/s (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>) for waves propagating on flat SLBs surfaces. Thus, similar to the conditions in vivo, where the period of the oscillations is inversely correlated with the temperature (<a href=\"#bib60\">Touhami et al., 2006</a>), elevated temperature increases the velocity of the Min propagation <i>in vitro</i>, doubling from 23\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C both on 2D surfaces and in 3D confinement. However, in contrast to the in vivo behavior, the <i>in vitro</i> wavelength is also temperature dependent. Since the viscosity of the bulk media change only by a factor of 1.3 from 23\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C, we have to attribute these results to a change in one of the reaction parameters of the reaction-diffusion Min system. We can conclude that there are different ways to modulate the different dynamical characteristics (wavelength and velocity) of the Min system."

We thus considerably expand previous experimental data since we mapped the Min behavior in a well-controlled manner over a section of the geometrical conditions where the microchambers have a much broader range of widths, while tightly restricting the height of the microchambers.

Spiral waves are common in various biological and chemical reaction-diffusion processes such as <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> aggregation, calcium variations in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and the famous Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction (see <a href=\"#bib11\">Epstein and Pojman, 1998</a> and references therein). They were also observed for the Min system on flat SLBs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Loose et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</a>). For reaction-diffusion systems other than the Min system, various symmetry-breaking-mechanisms were invoked in order to explain this spiral behavior. For example, for the BZ reaction, spiral waves were attributed to a Hopf bifurcation mechanism (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hagan, 1982</a>). In addition, it is well known that in nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, several symmetry-breaking-mechanisms may coexist in different parts of the parameter phase space and, as result, a plethora of static or dynamic patterns can emerge (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yang et al., 2002</a>). Many times these patterns possess similar observable behavior, yet having different underlying symmetry-breaking-mechanisms. In light of this knowledge, it is well possible that <i>in vitro</i> Min patterns, in fact, emanate from a somehow different symmetry-breaking-mechanism than the Min oscillations in live cells despite the fact that the proteins are the same and the patterns share various similar characteristics with the <i>in vivo</i> case. In other words, in spite of the common belief that the main difference between the <i>in vivo</i> behavior of the Min system and its behavior <i>in vitro</i> is merely related to a different wavelength, possibly, the symmetry-breaking-mechanisms are not exactly the same in both cases. The existence of spirals <i>in vitro</i> and their abundance in our confined microchambers, when compared to their absence from <i>in vivo</i> observations where pole-to-pole oscillations dominate (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wu et al., 2015</a>), may be related to this."

For a complex non-linear system, like the Min, it is relatively easy to construct a model that predicts the system behavior under a limited subset of the experimental data. This task becomes much harder, however, when experimental data exist for a wide range of conditions and system geometries. Such data thus help to restrict the class of possible theoretical models. In this report we provide such a detailed description of the <i>in vitro</i> behavior of the Min system in a wide section of the geometrical parameter space. Thus, our data restrict the possible classes of theoretical models that can explain the <i>in vitro</i> behavior of the Min system. In addition, since our microchambers height is relatively close to the actual diameter of a bacterial cell, our data further help to restrict the possible models for symmetry-breaking mechanisms that can describe the system behavior <i>in vitro</i> as well as <i>in vivo</i>."

These data are the first to suggest that <i>in vitro</i> oscillations are truncated spirals, a fact that further shows the importance of studying the geometric phase diagram of the Min system, as was done here.

In contrast to this, <i>in vitro</i> oscillations are more akin to a traveling wave that propagates toward one pole, whereupon it is then replaced by a wave that is established close to the chamber middle and propagates toward the opposite pole (we acknowledge the anonymous referee three for pointing out this difference). Similar behavior was also observed in <i>in vitro</i> oscillations of other reconstitution work (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zieske and Schwille, 2014</a>).

Recently, Bonny et al. also reported traveling waves in filamentous cells, but the abundance of this phenomenon was not reported (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bonny et al., 2013</a>). In this last case, the Min operon was induced at a saturating concentration and thus\ufeff the concentration of MinDE was probably much higher than in the native case for <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sliusarenko et al., 2011</a>). Finally, in vivo traveling waves were also observed in a small minority of filamentous cells, even if the Min operon is not over-induced and when the Min proteins do not harbor any mutations (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1d</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Note that in all these cases, the <i>in vivo</i> traveling waves represent a form of abnormal behavior which occurs if the MinE function is impaired or in other anomalous cases. This contrasts to the <i>in vitro</i> case, where traveling waves can be a generic feature of the Min system. In contrast to sporadic reports of Min waves <i>in vivo</i>, waves are almost always detected in <i>in vitro</i> assays on 2D SLBs. Two reasons are responsible for this observation. First, on flat 2D SLBs the spirals waves are not confined and hence waves that emanate from one center can travel long distance and interfere with waves that emanate from a second spiral center to form traveling waves. In our chambers, when their area became large, the intrinsic Min pattern formation mechanism and the reflection from the chambers walls resulted in the annihilation of spiral centers and the establishment of traveling waves, similar to the 2D case where boundaries are absent. The second reason for the formation of traveling waves is probably related to the concentration of the proteins in the <i>in vitro</i> assay. In a typical <i>in vitro</i> assay, one usually controls the bulk concentration of the proteins as the supply material. However, due to the small surface-to-volume ratio in typical <i>in vitro</i> assays, the actual concentration of the proteins on the membrane and the replenished reservoir of new Min proteins is higher than <i>in vivo</i> (cf. the above section on Min concentration in the microchambers). In fact, due to the experimental protocols employed, this observation is also correct for previous reconstitutions of the Min system in grooves (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zieske and Schwille, 2014</a>), as well as for published <i>in vitro</i> Min system flow assays (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ivanov and Mizuuchi, 2010</a>). This situation is qualitatively different from the <i>in vivo</i> case where, during the formation of polar zone or a Min band, most of the MinD proteins are recruited to the membrane and the cytosolic concentration thus drops to a low value. Indeed, in a very recent publication, Vecchiarelli et al. suggested that <i>in vitro</i> spirals\u00a0waves are related to high concentration of the Min proteins, while reconstituting the Min system under limiting concentration conditions resulted in a dynamical series of Min bursts that are reminiscent of the behavior in cells (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vecchiarelli et al., 2016</a>). Vecchiarelli et al. further checked the behavior of the Min proteins when MinE was replaced by a membrane-binding deficient mutant MinE<sup>11\u201388</sup>, and observed that in this case, Min waves were supported at high protein concentration, but bursting dynamics were absent. This observation was consistent with the one of Zieske et al. (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zieske and Schwille, 2014</a>) where oscillations were not observed with a similar mutant MinE(\u03943\u20138). Thus, it seems that the interrelations between several factors determine the pattern formation mechanism <i>in vitro</i>: the surface-to-volume ratio, the protein concentration, the confinement, and the binding of MinE to the membrane. Our results, with the relatively high Min protein concentration that we measured, support their conclusions. The fact that we fully confined the Min system in 3D chambers with a relatively small height enabled us to look on the behavior of the system in conditions with a surface-to-volume ratio that is much larger than previously studied. Combined with our measurements of the total Min protein concentration in the chambers, our results set a lower limit for the protein concentration that still reproduces traveling waves, rotational spirals, or oscillations under these geometric conditions. It will be interesting to check if current models of the Min system that reproduce in vivo behavior will also be able to reproduce traveling waves by simply increasing the proteins concentration. Indeed, Bonny et al. were able to show traveling waves in their theoretical system by increasing the Min concentration by 63% or by increasing the MinE to MinD ratio (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bonny et al., 2013</a>). In our geometrical analysis of Min patterns selection, we showed that in chambers with high surface-to-volume ratio, and a high Min proteins concentration, the cumulative effect of annihilation of multiple spirals and of the reflection from the walls can result in the formation of traveling waves."

We have observed a reduction in the Min wavelength by a factor of two in our microchambers relative to the case of 2D flat SLB. Taking a reaction-diffusion point-of-view, this observation can be explained in two ways. First, the lateral confinement by itself may be responsible for choosing dynamical modes of the system with a smaller wavelength. Second, the height reduction could change the balance between the reservoir of the free Min proteins in solution relative to the bound ones. Indeed, based on their model, Halatek and Frey recently suggested, that reducing the volume of Min proteins above the surface will drive the typical wavelength of the system to lower values (personal communication). Similarly, it was shown theoretically by Thalmeier et al. (<a href=\"#bib59\">Thalmeier et al., 2016</a>) that even in the absence of MinE, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> MinD can form an intracellular gradient just based on the relations between the bulk diffusion and nucleotide exchange rates, but only in highly confined spaces. Thus, our observation that reducing the height of the chamber is accompanied by a reduction of both the wavelength and the wave velocity further stresses the value of our approach of studying the Min behavior in 3D confined spaces with a high surface-to-volume ratio. We note, however, that our chambers are 2.4\u00a0\u00b5m high, not too much larger than the 1\u00a0\u00b5m diameter of an <i>E. coli</i> bacterium, and yet, we measured a wavelength that is an order of magnitude larger than the characteristic length scale observed in vivo."

First, the Min wavelength decreased by a factor of 2 when the viscosity of the medium was raised to 10\u00a0cP, i.e., similar to that of cells and ten times larger than a regular buffer. Still, even at this high viscosity, the wavelength was larger by a factor of \u223c5 from the one measured in vivo. In addition, the reduction in wavelength was accompanied by a very large reduction in the wave propagation velocity. Note that the measured velocity in the highly viscous media was similar or even smaller than the one measured <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib62\">Unai et al., 2009</a>) (see also the supporting information in [<a href=\"#bib2\">Bonny et al., 2013</a>]). It is thus unlikely that additional increases in viscosity can bring both the characteristic length scale and the propagation velocity of the system <i>in vitro</i> to the <i>in vivo</i> values. Interestingly, unlike the situation in unconfined 2D reconstitution of the Min proteins (<a href=\"#bib39\">Martos et al., 2015</a>), in microchambers with a high surface-to-volume ratio, the period of the Min wave (i.e., wavelength<math id=\"inf5\"><mo>/</mo></math>velocity) was not constant but was reduced by a factor of about 8."

The effect of the temperature on the characteristic wavelength was much larger for the Min waves on flat SLBs than in the 3D confined chambers. Since the diffusion rate does not change substantially between room temperature and 37\u00b0C (only a factor of 1.3, by the Einstein\u2019s relation), the temperature effect in the 2D surface case is most likely the result of a change in one of the reaction parameters, most probably the ATP hydrolysis rate. This situation is different in the microchambers. Our observations suggest that the main <i>in vitro</i> determinant of the wavelength at elevated temperature in confined spaces is the geometrical confinement itself. In other word, geometrical confinement forces the system to choose a reaction-diffusion mode with a reduced wavelength which can only marginally be tuned further by increasing the temperature. Thus, in highly confined spaces the effect of temperature on the characteristic scale of the Min system is largely diminished, and is accounted by the small increase in diffusion rate. This fact can explain the previous <i>in vivo</i> results where no temperature dependence for the wavelength was detected (<a href=\"#bib60\">Touhami et al., 2006</a>). It should be noted that the reduced length scale was accompanied by an increase, rather than a decrease, of the wave velocity. This observation is in line with the <i>in vivo</i> case where the oscillation period was smaller at high temperature. Our results points out that the dynamical characteristics of the Min system contain several decoupled parameters, such as wavelength and velocity that can be tuned in opposite directions. It is thus essential to study their action in the context of 3D confined spaces with a high surface-to-volume ratio."

This can be a simple thing like a change in the concentration of one of the Min proteins (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vecchiarelli et al., 2016</a>) or a change in one of the reaction rates. It is also possible that yet another physical or biological mechanism contributes to the different symmetry breaking in both cases. Biochemical assays have shown intricate effects of the Min system on the membrane organization in the <i>in vivo</i> context. For example, MinD increased the order of the lipids and decreased their mobility in inverted inner <i>E. coli</i> membranes that contained integral proteins more than it does in synthetic vesicles that are purely lipidic (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mazor et al., 2008</a>). Similarly, the Min system affects the association of inner-membrane peripheral proteins and interacts with some of them directly (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2016</a>).

For all cases we analyzed the MinE signals, since the MinD signal gave less contrast and it makes no essential difference since both MinD and MinE signal the same qualitative and quantitative behavior of the patterns. First, for each movie, the field of view (FOV) was rotated automatically to make chambers fully vertical by calculating the standard deviation of each line along the average intensity of the movie and finding the angle at which this value is minimized. Next, the frames of the movies were thresholded using one of the built-in thresholding methods of Matlab and segmented automatically into chambers by finding intensity steps along the horizontal and vertical dimensions of an average or STD frame of the movie. We implemented a human-controlled correction step for both the rotation and segmentation steps in order to bypass program imperfection. The intensity of the Min proteins in each chamber was then recorded and the average intensity in each chamber was calculated separately and subtracted in order to produce separate movies for each chamber. The velocity of propagation was calculated by incorporating codes for the U-track 2.1.3 Matlab package that was developed in the Danuser lab (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jaqaman et al., 2008</a>). For calculating the wavelength, a line, featuring the propagating direction was generated automatically based on the U-track results. Next, the intensity along this line was recorded for each frame of the background subtracted movie and a kymograph was generated. A peak finder Matlab routine (written by Jacob Kerssemakers) was used in order to locate the peaks distance along each line of the kymograph, and a histogram of the peak distances was generated. A Gaussian fit to the histogram was then used in order to find the mean value of the wavelength in each chamber. For calculating wavelengths on flat supported lipid bilayer (SLB), we used the same algorithm with the slight modification that the line along the waves\u2019 propagation direction was drawn manually. Velocities of the wave propagation on 2D flat SLB were calculated by rotating the peaks\u2019 kymograph and minimizing the average standard deviation along each line of the rotated kymograph. From the angle that minimizes the standard deviation and the error in the angle one can easily infer back the propagation velocity.

This means that the known concentration of a cytosolic fluorescent protein, such as GFP, can be used as a calibration tool in order to infer the actual concentration of the Min proteins in the microchambers by comparing the relative fluorescence, given that the relation between the relative fluorescence of GFP and either MinD or MinE is known for conditions where the Min proteins cannot bind the membrane. Thus, in order to measure the concentrations of the Min proteins in our chambers, we used a combination of a fluorescent measurement of the Min proteins signal in the chambers relative to their fluorescence at different concentrations in a cuvette measured with a fluorometer, and compared these values to the fluorescence of purified green fluorescence protein (deGFP - a variant of GFP see <a href=\"#bib55\">Shin and Noireaux, 2012</a>), which was a kind gift of the Christophe Danelon lab (<math id=\"inf10\"><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><msubsup id=\"XM14\"><mi>C</mi><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>P</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>o</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>15</mn><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.9</mn></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow></math> as measured by the Pierce 660 assay from Thermo Fisher scientific)."

We do not fully understand the source of this non-linearity, but we suspect that it\u00a0is related to some dequenching effect. However, the behavior was clearly reproducible as it was repeated in three independent experiments. Note also that the background signals in the microchambers in all fluorescence channels were measured before the injection of the proteins and were subtracted for the signal in the microchambers in the presence of the proteins. Similarly, the background values in the fluorometer were measured and subtracted from the protein signals."

As correctly stated in their paper, this can be achieved by making the in vitro systems more and more similar to the in vivo situations. The authors have developed a microfluidic-based assay that allows to study Min protein patterns in three-dimensional membrane covered compartments. However, most observations have been previously made by other labs. For example, although the authors claim that they are the first to use \"truly confined 3D structures\", Zieske et al. 2013 and 2014 did fully confine the proteins in 3D (the proteins could not diffuse out of their compartments). It is therefore not really surprising that their findings basically match previous reports."

Similar to Wu et al. (2015), the authors present a detailed statistical analysis, on which basis they claim to have discovered a new regime of \"spiral rotations\". However, one could argue that this is a mere although not very convincing reclassification of existing knowledge. It certainly does not contribute much to our understanding of Min protein patterns (see below)."

Accordingly, the patterns in small geometries simply represent \"cropped\" spirals). In fact, this observation was shown by two papers from the Schwille lab (Schweizer 2011, Zieske 2014). According to the authors their data suggests that the symmetry breaking mechanism in vivo could be different in vivo, but I do not understand how the data presented justifies this hypothesis."

They also suggest that confinement could lead to decrease in wavelength, most probably due to depletion of material, but a direct evidence backed up by additional controls is missing for this hypothesis. For example, one could quantify the ATP hydrolysis rate, membrane binding and detachment rates at different temperatures as well as the wavelength at different total protein concentrations. (One minor comment in this context: for the quantification of protein concentrations the significant autofluorescence of PDMS has not been taken into account, this could have lead to an overestimation of protein concentrations inside of the chambers. In addition, I am very confused about the nonlinear fit shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The authors also examined effect of molecular crowding and temperature on the in vitro patterns and compared with the known patterns observed in <i>E. coli</i>. Although difference did exist, it was not sufficient to explain the scale difference between in vivo and in vitro observations. There are additional important points raised by the authors, including limitation for the current theoretical models to be capable of predicting all patterns, and the difficulty in reproducing the Min patterns in vitro at the same size scale as in vivo."

The chamber geometry dictates the preference of the Min system for one of these classes of patterning. This work greatly expands our understanding of the link between patterning and chamber geometry.

The oscillations described in the manuscript and the attached videos are quite different from the Min oscillations observed in vivo. The spatial distribution of Min proteins is more akin to a one-dimensional travelling wave that originates in the centre of the chamber and moves to one pole at which time a new wave arises in the centre and translates to the opposite pole. The difference between this and in vivo observations (obvious when one compares the kymographs presented with published in vivo kymographs) may well be due to the size gap that still exists between these chambers (minimum dimensions 10 \u03bcm x 10 \u03bcm x 2.4 um) with bacterial cells. A clear comparison of the in vitro oscillation with in vivo oscillation should be presented and discussed."

To our understanding, the true confinement of the Min system in 3D with a small height (5 times smaller than achieved in the work of Zieske and Schwille) restricts the volume accessible for Min protein to exchange between the bulk and membrane-bound forms, and doing so results in the reduced length scale. This observation is at the heart of studying the effect of confinement on the Min system in vitro. As was very recently shown theoretically (but not yet tested experimentally), the formation of a depletion zone as result of the combination between diffusion and geometry is a key parameter in the formation of intracellular gradients (Thalmeier et al. PNAS 113, 2016). This theoretical prediction is novel, while, to the best of our knowledge, no in vitro evidence exists yet in the literature to verify this important novel concept. Our finding of a reduced wavelength in the microchambers, just because of the confinement, is therefore a novel experimental finding that significantly expands the scientific understanding of intracellular protein gradients as well as their reconstitution in vitro."

On 2D surfaces, by contrast, we observed a reduced wavelength that cannot be understood from diffusion rate differences alone. In that case, the effect indeed can result, as referee 1 suggests, from the difference in various reaction parameters. However, the behavior on 2D surface is not the focus of our manuscript which is already loaded with data on different conditions in the chambers. We therefore feel that it is appropriate to leave any extension on this observation for future work. This is emphasized by the fact that no one knows how to accurately measure reaction rates such as the MinD attachment rate or the cooperativity rate, and thus to disentangle the effect of different reaction parameters on this phenomenon."

Usually, such an in vivo MinE fluorescent signal is obtained by an ectopic expression of a recombinant fluorescent MinE from an inducible promoter, which typically leads to overexpression of MinE. In the strain that we used, however, the recombinant fluorescent MinE was expressed from its native locus on the chromosome under the native Min promoter (Wu et al. Molec. Syst. Biol. (2016) 12: 873). This is nice since it expresses the MinE at its natural level but this also led to only a weak fluorescence MinE signal, making it very hard to obtain clear MinE images in vivo (which is why we resorted to reporting the MinD signal). Note that in this strain MinD and MinE proteins do move concurrently and no E-ring is observed (see for example Results and Video EV3 of the Supplementary Information of that paper by Wu et al.). Thus, for this endogenous-expression strain, the MinE and MinD kymographs are similar. Interestingly, in vitro, MinD and MinE move concurrently as well. Reports of in vitro waves showed no evidence for an E-ring structure, and while the intensity MinE wave profile was slightly different from that of MinD (Loose et al. Science (2008) 320, 789-792; Loose at al. Nat Struct Mol Biol (2011), 18, 577-583) the MinE again moved concurrently with MinD. Summing up, similar patterns were observed for MinD and MinE and the fact that we report MinE signal in vitro and MinD signal in vivo does not make any difference for the conclusions that are drawn here."
