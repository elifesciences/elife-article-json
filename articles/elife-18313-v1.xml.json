Here we demonstrate that thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip), which regulates glucose homeostasis in mammals, binds to fructose transporters and promotes fructose absorption by the small intestine. Deletion of <i>Txnip</i> in mice reduced fructose transport into the peripheral bloodstream and liver, as well as the severity of adverse metabolic outcomes resulting from long-term fructose consumption. We also demonstrate that fructose consumption induces expression of Txnip in the small intestine. Diabetic mice had increased expression of Txnip in the small intestine as well as enhanced fructose uptake and transport into the hepatic portal circulation. The deletion of <i>Txnip</i> in mice abolished the diabetes-induced increase in fructose absorption. Our results indicate that Txnip is a critical regulator of fructose metabolism and suggest that a diabetic state can promote fructose uptake."

Here we demonstrate that thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip), which regulates glucose homeostasis in mammals, binds to fructose transporters and promotes fructose absorption by the small intestine. Deletion of <i>Txnip</i> in mice reduced fructose transport into the peripheral bloodstream and liver, as well as the severity of adverse metabolic outcomes resulting from long-term fructose consumption. We also demonstrate that fructose consumption induces expression of Txnip in the small intestine. Diabetic mice had increased expression of Txnip in the small intestine as well as enhanced fructose uptake and transport into the hepatic portal circulation. The deletion of <i>Txnip</i> in mice abolished the diabetes-induced increase in fructose absorption. Our results indicate that Txnip is a critical regulator of fructose metabolism and suggest that a diabetic state can promote fructose uptake."

The amount of fructose in our diet has increased dramatically in the last few decades. Growing evidence suggests that excessive amounts of fructose contribute to several metabolic diseases, including fatty liver disease and diabetes. Fructose is absorbed in the small intestine via transport proteins called GLUT2 and GLUT5 and then travels to the liver where it can stimulate the cells to make fats. However, it is not clear how fructose uptake is regulated in the small intestine."

The uptake of fructose by the small intestine controls its availability to organs that are able to metabolize fructose, including liver (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asano et al., 1992</a>) and kidney (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sugawara-Yokoo et al., 1999</a>). Following ingestion, fructose is absorbed by enterocytes in the small intestine, first entering from the intestinal lumen through glucose transporter 5 (GLUT5) on the apical membrane (<a href=\"#bib3\">Burant et al., 1992</a>) and then exiting the enterocyte into the bloodstream through glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) on the basolateral membrane (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gould et al., 1991</a>), although GLUT2 can translocate to the apical membrane in response to increased fructose levels in the lumen (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gouyon et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kellett and Brot-Laroche, 2005</a>)."

Downstream metabolic intermediates of fructose, including acetyl-CoA, can be directed toward <i>de novo</i> lipogenesis, promoting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abdelmalek et al., 2010</a>). The build-up of hepatic triglycerides also promotes insulin resistance and obesity by impairing insulin signaling and increasing global lipid circulation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wei and Pagliassotti, 2004</a>). Compared to blood glucose levels (in the range of 5\u2009mM in humans), blood fructose levels are maintained at low levels (<a href=\"#bib8\">Douard and Ferraris, 2008</a>) (0.008 to 0.5\u2009mM in humans) through the efficient clearance by the liver and, to a lesser extent, by the kidneys (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mayes, 1993</a>). Thus, the pathogenesis of fructose-associated metabolic disease is dependent on the function of GLUT2 and GLUT5 as the primary transporters of fructose of enterocytes on the small intestine, particularly the duodenum and jejunum, which facilitate most carbohydrate absorption."

Expression of Txnip is highly correlated with extracellular glucose concentrations which upregulate the activity of the transcription complexes chREBP/Mlx and MondoA/Mlx that bind to the carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) on the <i>Txnip</i> promoter to induce <i>Txnip</i> mRNA expression (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cha-Molstad et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Stoltzman et al., 2008</a>).

The Caco-2 cell line is a human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line that when plated as a confluent monolayer resembles the enterocyte lining of the small intestine, both morphologically and functionally (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hidalgo et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Engle et al., 1998</a>). Measuring the retention of 14C-radiolabeled D-fructose in confluent Caco-2 cells revealed that simultaneous overexpression of TXNIP with GLUT2 or GLUT5 increased cellular 14C-radiolabeled D-fructose uptake by 161% and 162% (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001; <i>n</i> = 6) respectively relative to the empty vector (EV) transfection control (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Interestingly, overexpression of either fructose transporter in the absence of TXNIP overexpression was insufficient to produce a marked increase in cellular fructose uptake, suggesting that Txnip expression is required to facilitate the function of GLUT2 and GLUT5 under some circumstances. Overexpression of TXNIP with both fructose transporters produced the greatest increase in cellular fructose uptake. After normalizing the uptake in cells overexpressing TXNIP/GLUT2 or TXNIP/GLUT5 to that of cells overexpressing all three proteins, we found that the normalized ratios of uptake were not different in cells overexpressing TXNIP/GLUT2 and TXNIP/GLUT5, suggesting that the effects of GLUT2 and GLUT5 may be similar and synergistic in Txnip-mediated fructose uptake. A reciprocal loss-of-function experiment using high-passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from WT or <i>Txnip</i>-null (<i>Txnip</i>-KO) mice revealed that <i>Txnip</i>-KO MEFs retained 51.3% of the fructose compared to WT MEFs (p&lt;0.001; <i>n</i> = 6); this reduction in cellular uptake was rescued by transient overexpression of human TXNIP, showing that the deletion of <i>Txnip</i> reduces cellular fructose uptake (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). An ex vivo analysis revealed a reduced uptake of 14C-radiolabeled D-fructose of 50.9% (p&lt;0.001; <i>n</i> = 6) in jejunum isolated from <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice compared to WT mice, indicating that Txnip expression promotes fructose uptake by the small intestine, particularly by the jejunum, which, in conjunction with the duodenum, is the primary site of fructose absorption (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>)."

We administered 14C-radiolabeled fructose in a 30% solution of fructose and mannitol (to correct fructose uptake into tissue for the adherent extracellular fluid phase) and allowed for 20 min of digestion before measuring the retention of 14C-radiolabeled fructose in various tissues of interest. We used 20 min as the standard time point for this experiment, as it was the time point at which the peripheral blood in wild type mice contained the greatest 14C signal (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which was also confirmed in our later experiments (Figure 5). The liver from <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice demonstrated a reduction of 14C-radiolabeled D-fructose to 42.4% compared to liver\u00a0from WT mice\u00a0(p&lt;0.05; <i>n</i> = 4), suggesting that the transport of fructose from the intestinal lumen to the hepatic portal blood system was reduced in <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>); this finding was confirmed in additional data shown below in measurements of hepatic portal vein blood\u00a0(Figure\u00a05). The reduced levels of 14C-radiolabeled fructose received and processed by the liver subsequently manifested in peripheral blood in <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice, which had a fructose signal that was 54.9% compared to that of WT (p&lt;0.01; <i>n</i> = 4). (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). Heart and kidney tissue from <i>Txnip-</i>KO mice also exhibited a decrease in 14C D-fructose signal, but this signal was lower than that of the peripheral blood, indicating that the observed difference may be due to decreased circulating levels of fructose and not by uptake by these organs. Interestingly, the rectus femoris muscle from both groups demonstrated no differences within the parameters of the experiment and had a fructose signal lower than levels found in circulating blood despite previous studies reporting fructose uptake and Txnip expression in skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#bib28\">Parikh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Zierath et al., 1995</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>).

After normalizing the 14C D-fructose signal of the other organs to that found in the blood, we observed no differences in any of the organs collected, including liver and kidney, both of which have the ability to absorb and process fructose (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results indicate that the effect of Txnip on fructose absorption may be specific to the small intestine. As such, the small intestine may be the primary regulator of fructose access to the body, or other compensatory mechanisms may exist to regulate fructose concentrations in these organs."

                                "text": "While the physiological consequences of dietary fructose consumption remain controversial, there is increasing evidence suggesting an association between fructose consumption and metabolic diseases (<a href=\"#bib16\">Johnson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ouyang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Stanhope, 2016</a>). To determine if the negative effects of chronic fructose consumption are diminished in <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice, which have a marked decrease in fructose absorption, we supplemented a moderate fat diet (containing 0.16% fructose) of WT and <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice with 30% w/v fructose in their drinking water; this diet is similar to the Western-style diet, which is enriched with saturated fats and sugar (<a href=\"#bib37\">Stevenson et al., 2016</a>). We maintained mice on the fructose-supplemented diet (FSD) for 25 weeks before measuring differences in physiological parameters in comparison to mice on the moderate fat regular diet (RD). Because male mice on a moderate fat diet develop adverse metabolic outcomes even without supplementary fructose (<a href=\"#bib25\">Morselli et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hwang et al., 2010</a>), we analyzed the effects of the fructose-supplemented diet on female mice. WT mice on the FSD had a higher body weight of 7.73 \u00b1 2.61\u2009g relative to WT mice on the RD (mean \u00b1 SEM; <i>n</i> = 5, p&lt;0.05), while <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice on both diets maintained similar weights to the WT mice on the RD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice have reduced fasting blood glucose levels and are able to effectively maintain decreased blood glucose levels following insulin injection and reduce blood glucose levels to baseline levels following glucose injection (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chutkow et al., 2008</a>). The prolonged FSD caused significant systemic intolerance to intraperitoneal injections of glucose (2\u00a0g/kg) as well as reduced response to insulin (0.25 milliunits/g) in WT animals (<i>n</i> = 5), whereas <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice were resistant to these metabolic consequences caused by the FSD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,c</a>). Sirius Red staining of liver sections used to measure hepatic fibrosis revealed that WT mice on the FSD had a nearly five\u00a0fold increased hepatic collagen content relative to the WT mice on the RD (<i>n =</i> 5, p&lt;0.01), while <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice had comparable levels to WT mice on the RD regardless of the diet they were fed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). Liver sections graded using a previously described method for hepatocellular steatosis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burgess et al., 2011</a>) revealed that WT mice on the FSD scored significantly worse compared to mice on the RD (<i>n =</i> 5, p&lt;0.001), indicating more liver fat content and steatosis; the severity of steatosis was significantly reduced in <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice on the FSD ([p&lt;0.001] [<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>]). Together, these data demonstrate that the <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice on the FSD had reduced severity of adverse metabolic outcomes associated with a high fructose diet relative to their WT counterparts. This phenotype may result from decreased absorption of fructose by the small intestine but could be attributed to the lack of Txnip in the various other tissues."

Because two separate groups of mice were studied (normal diet and fructose diet) to determine the effect of fructose on the interaction between Txnip and GLUT2 and GLUT5, we analyzed FLIM values between Txnip and GLUT2 and GLUT5 within each group relative to donor only controls (Txnip only).\u00a0We then compared these relative changes across groups. We measured FLIM values at co-localizing regions between Txnip and GLUT2 or GLUT5, and we measured an equal number of regions across all samples. As such, an increase in protein mass resulting from the observed mRNA expression is unlikely to significantly impact the results. Rather, we expect observed differences to result from changes in the nature of the interaction between Txnip and both fructose transporters. The values for both \u03c4<sub>1</sub> and a<sub>1</sub>(%) were calculated for Txnip within one group. The averages of these values were used for comparison across groups. After determining the donor fluorescence lifetime (Txnip) in the absence of the acceptor fluorophore (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, Donor Only), FRET between donor and acceptor was defined by the lifetime of interacting molecules (\u03c4<sub>1</sub>), with a<sub>1</sub> (%) representing the fraction of interacting molecules. \u03c41 is an indirect measurement of distance between two molecules because the lifetime of the donor fluorophore diminishes with increasing proximity to the acceptor fluorophore, which can quench donor emissions. We found that Txnip interacted with both GLUT2 and GLUT5 in the small intestine of animals on the RD as indicated by a decrease in \u03c4<sub>1</sub> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Under the FSD, we observed a decrease in \u03c4<sub>1</sub> for both GLUT2 and GLUT5 relative to samples form the RD, indicating increased proximity between Txnip and the two GLUTs (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This result indicates that the Txnip interaction with the fructose transporters responds to fructose loads. It also suggests that both fructose transporters are involved in Txnip-mediated fructose transport, consistent with our fructose uptake experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Though a<sub>1%</sub> values increased modestly for GLUT2 under the FSD relative to the RD, the contribution of this increase to fructose uptake is not clear (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Collectively, these data suggest that Txnip expression and interaction with GLUT2 and GLUT5 in the jejunum are responsive to chronic fructose consumption, and these changes may contribute to fructose absorption into the body."

To determine if diabetes has a similar effect on Txnip expression in the small intestine, we used the streptozotocin (STZ) model of type 1 diabetes in mice. All mice receiving STZ injections developed hyperglycemia, allowing us to compare the effect of this diabetic phenotype to euglycemic sodium citrate buffer (vehicle)-injected non-diabetic controls. Although <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice are hypoglycemic compared to their wild type counterparts at baseline (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chutkow et al., 2008</a>), STZ-injected <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice achieved a higher average blood glucose level relative to non-diabetic <i>Txnip</i>-KO mice (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that WT STZ-injected mice had higher levels of <i>Txnip</i> mRNA expression in the jejunum compared to wild type non-diabetic mice, indicating that the diabetic state promotes Txnip expression in the small intestine (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>)."

While it has long been known that glucose promotes fructose uptake by the small intestine, the exact mechanism for this effect remains unknown (<a href=\"#bib33\">Riby et al., 1993</a>). It was once believed that glucose promotes fructose uptake through a disaccharide transport system (<a href=\"#bib33\">Riby et al., 1993</a>). Our data in combination with other studies (<a href=\"#bib28\">Parikh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Patwari et al., 2006</a>) suggests that Txnip links glucose homeostasis with fructose transport, as diabetes induces Txnip expression, which promotes fructose absorption. Because excess absorption of fructose contributes to liver fat accumulation and hypertension, our experiments suggest that the diabetic state may contribute to these components of metabolic disease at least in part through Txnip and increased fructose transport. The ability of Txnip to regulate fructose metabolism indicates that glucose homeostasis and fructose metabolism are intertwined, possibly in a manner that potentiates metabolic diseases in settings of high fructose consumption, which is often accompanied by similar loads of glucose as sucrose and others sweeteners."

We demonstrated that Txnip interacts with both fructose transporters and is upregulated in response to fructose consumption. We also observed that the effect of Txnip on fructose transport is specific to the small intestine, as organs collected from intravenously injected <i>Txnip</i>-null animals had similar amounts of fructose to wild-type counterparts. However, defining the detailed molecular mechanism through which Txnip regulates fructose transporters is important. Elevated levels of fructose and glucose in the small intestine can cause GLUT2 to transiently translocate to the apical brush border membrane of enterocytes in order to further facilitate fructose transport, accounting for up to 60% of fructose absorption in animals consuming high amounts of sugar (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gouyon et al., 2003</a>). The translocation of GLUT2 is affected by activation of protein kinase C and MAP kinase (<a href=\"#bib12\">Helliwell et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kellett, 2001</a>), both of which also have the ability to activate Txnip expression and activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2009</a>). Past studies observed that activation of the PKC signaling pathway by phorbol 12-myristate (PMA) and the influx of Ca2+ through L-type channels induces cytoskeletal re-arrangement, leading to the insertion of GLUT2 protein at the brush border membrane (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kellett and Helliwell, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Morgan et al., 2007</a>). In addition, Txnip expression is attenuated by the calcium channel blocker verapamil (<a href=\"#bib42\">Xu et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that normally due to the influx of calcium, Txnip could be facilitating the movement of GLUT2 to the apical membrane as a scaffold protein that directly binds to the glucose transporters."

A previous study found that AMPK activation had a positive effect on GLUT1-facilitated glucose transport, which the researchers attributed to the change in the binding affinity of Txnip for GLUT1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). Regulation of GLUT2 and GLUT5-mediated fructose absorption could occur through a similar mechanism in which the binding of Txnip is necessary for this process."

Studying the Txnip-mediated fructose absorption mechanism, thus, will require a more precise inquiry into how enterocyte Txnip expression affects fructose uptake by the digestive tract. Other possibilities exist for why this discrepancy occurs because the intravenous injection not only bypasses the small intestine but also the first-pass metabolism and uptake by the liver."

While elevated glucose levels promote Txnip expression, elevated insulin levels decrease Txnip expression (<a href=\"#bib28\">Parikh et al., 2007</a>). Because chronic fructose intake is associated with impaired insulin signaling, it could facilitate the disruption of glucose homeostasis and the transition of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes through Txnip. In addition, fructose metabolism can lead to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent redox stress in cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Morgan et al., 2007</a>). Because Txnip is responsive to\u00a0the redox environment of the cell, fructose may indirectly regulate Txnip expression through this mechanism. As a result, fructose could affect Txnip in a manner that disrupts glucose metabolism and further increase fructose absorption by promoting Txnip expression, similar to how glucose can regulate Txnip to change fructose metabolism."

The deletion of Txnip alleviated mice of these effects to an extent, suggesting that Txnip and other factors involved in the Txnip-mediated fructose absorption pathway could be potential therapeutic targets. However, much more understanding of this molecular pathway is necessary to determine if and when regulation of the pathway may be beneficial. We observed that the STZ-induced diabetic state causes a marked increase in fructose uptake by the small intestine and transport into hepatic portal vein circulation. STZ-diabetic mice showed an increase in absorption of fructose, which could contribute to metabolic dysfunction, as was the case in our long-term fructose supplemented diet experiment in which the mice developed pathologies compared to mice with relatively lower fructose consumption. STZ induces hypoinsulinemia and subsequent hyperglycemia mediated through pancreatic beta cell death, so further studies will be necessary to determine if all causes of hyperglycemia can regulate fructose absorption by the small intestine. Future studies in mice with cell-specific deletion of <i>Txnip</i> may reveal more detail on how Txnip regulates fructose transport. Controversy remains on the effect of the diabetic state on fructose absorption (<a href=\"#bib36\">Stanhope, 2016</a>). One study in Japan observed an increase in serum fructose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus relative to healthy patients who had no diabetic symptoms (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kawasaki et al., 2002</a>); these patients were all admitted to the same hospital and had their diets monitored and were fasting when blood serum was collected. However, another study in Finnish patients did not observe a difference in fructose serum levels when comparing type 2 diabetic patients to patients with no diabetic symptoms (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pitk\u00e4nen, 1996</a>). The patients in that study were not fasted prior to blood collection, and many of the diabetic patients had many diabetes-related complications affecting their health. Currently, it is difficult to determine based on available\u00a0human data if the diabetic state and which specific physiological pathology of diabetes may affect fructose absorption\u00a0in\u00a0humans. Our data suggest that glucose homeostasis and fructose absorption interact. Given the potential importance of fructose metabolism in modern societies, more investigation into this phenomenon is warranted."

Organs of interest (blood, small and large intestine, liver, kidney, and femur muscle) were harvested. Portal vein blood was extracted from the vein using heparinized tubing and needle. Approximately 50\u2013150 mg of each tissue of interest was dissolved in Soluene-350 and added to the appropriate amount of Ultima Gold Scintillation Fluid.

In reductionist systems, Txnip interacts with Glut5 and Glut2, and its expression promotes fructose transport. Cells from Txnip null mice have decreased fructose uptake, which is rescued by human Txnip. Gavage demonstrates decreased content of label presented as fructose in several tissues of Txnip KO mice, but these differences were not seen with tail vein administration of labeled fructose. Txnip deficient female mice eating a fat diet supplemented with fructose were protected from weight gain and abnormal glucose metabolism and protected from morphologic evidence of metabolic liver disease. The dietary intervention is associated with an interaction between Txnip and Glut5/Glu2 in the jejunum. Strep-induced diabetes increases Txnip expression in WT mice and appeared to promote fructose uptake."

How was this time point determined? Given the rapid metabolic rate in mice, substantial compartmental flux likely takes place over this time period. The fructose would be metabolized and signals might not necessarily reflect fructose transport. The authors address this problem (and its relevance to the strep-induced state) with the data of <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. But these data do not quantitatively account for fructose absorption, this is done at 10 minutes after oral gavage, and the results are confusing. The text in the subsection \u201cInsulin-deficient diabetes induced by streptozotocin increases Txnip expression and fructose absorption\u201d indicates that these findings represent stable isotope label from jejunum, but the legend of <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a> indicates that the signal is from jejunum and hepatic portal vein blood.

Is it possible that this interaction is due to a trivial reason, the presence of increased glucose transporter protein mass? <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> presents data showing that FSD increases message for Glut2 and Glut5. Are Glut2 and Glut5 protein abundances increased? If so, more interaction would be expected. What is missing from this line of research is insight into how Txnip might promote fructose transport. At least for other transporters, protein mass is not the major predictor of facilitated movement of sugars across membranes. Instead, the fusion of transporter vesicles with the plasma membrane is critical. Does Txnip mediate this fusion event?"

As such, we do not believe the rapid metabolism of fructose negatively affects our time point selection because D-fructose levels are significantly different in our experimental groups during the earlier time points of fructose absorption. In addition, the downstream metabolites of D-fructose may be partially responsible for the metabolic phenotype observed as a result of long-term fructose feeding because these may be more readily usable by other organs."

The interaction data acquired from the FLIM results support this result. The numerical changes of the \u03c4<sub>1</sub> values is actually quite strong, and the biological significance does not need to show a greater decrease. In fact, \u03c4<sub>1</sub> determines the relationship between the domains of the two molecules being probed by the antibodies, so, these changes may reflect a component of a more dramatic change in the relationship between Txnip and GLUT2 or GLUT5, or be sufficient by itself to impact the functional interaction in a major way."
