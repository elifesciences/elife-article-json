                    "text": "Autophagy is a fundamental adaptive response to amino acid starvation orchestrated by conserved gene products, the autophagy (ATG) proteins. However, the cellular cues that activate the function of ATG proteins during amino acid starvation are incompletely understood. Here we show that two related stress-responsive kinases, members of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and MAPKAPK3 (MK3), positively regulate starvation-induced autophagy by phosphorylating an essential ATG protein, Beclin 1, at serine 90, and that this phosphorylation site is essential for the tumor suppressor function of Beclin 1. Moreover, MK2/MK3-dependent Beclin 1 phosphorylation (and starvation-induced autophagy) is blocked in vitro and in vivo by BCL2, a negative regulator of Beclin 1. Together, these findings reveal MK2/MK3 as crucial stress-responsive kinases that promote autophagy through Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation, and identify the blockade of MK2/3-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation as a mechanism by which BCL2 inhibits the autophagy function of Beclin 1."

However, the cellular cues that activate the function of ATG proteins during amino acid starvation are incompletely understood. Here we show that two related stress-responsive kinases, members of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and MAPKAPK3 (MK3), positively regulate starvation-induced autophagy by phosphorylating an essential ATG protein, Beclin 1, at serine 90, and that this phosphorylation site is essential for the tumor suppressor function of Beclin 1. Moreover, MK2/MK3-dependent Beclin 1 phosphorylation (and starvation-induced autophagy) is blocked in vitro and in vivo by BCL2, a negative regulator of Beclin 1. Together, these findings reveal MK2/MK3 as crucial stress-responsive kinases that promote autophagy through Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation, and identify the blockade of MK2/3-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation as a mechanism by which BCL2 inhibits the autophagy function of Beclin 1."

The autophagy pathway is mediated by a set of evolutionary conserved proteins, the ATG proteins, that include proteins involved in the Atg1/ULK1 serine/threonine kinase protein complex, the Beclin 1/VPS34 class III phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3K) complex, and the ATG5/ATG12/ATG16 and Atg8/LC3 protein conjugation complexes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Levine and Klionsky, 2004</a>). The activity of these ATG protein complexes can be regulated by protein\u2013protein interactions, post-translational modifications (e.g., ubiquitination, phosphorylation, acetylation), and at the transcriptional level (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kroemer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abrahamsen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Norris and Yao, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">B\u00e1nr\u00e9ti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Webster et al., 2014</a>)."

The low-energy sensing kinase, AMPK, also acts directly on components of the autophagy machinery (ULK1, Beclin 1, VPS34) to positively regulate glucose starvation-induced autophagy (<a href=\"#bib10\">Egan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2013</a>), but does not appear to function similarly in amino acid starvation-induced autophagy (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2013</a>).

During amino acid starvation, Beclin 1-associated VPS34 autophagy complex activity is negatively regulated by the direct binding of Beclin 1 to BCL2 or BCL2L1 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sinha and Levine, 2008</a>), and by inhibitory interactions with the oncogenic kinases, AKT and EGFR (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wei et al., 2013</a>), the Golgi-associated protein, GLIPR2/GAPR-1 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shoji-Kawata et al., 2013</a>), and the kinase MST1 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Maejima et al., 2013</a>). Several proteins positively regulate the Beclin 1-associated VPS34 autophagy complex, including those that disrupt BCL2/BCL2L1-Beclin 1 binding by either Beclin 1 phosphorylation (e.g., DAPK, ROCK [<a href=\"#bib72\">Zalckvar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gurkar et al., 2013</a>]) or BCL2 phosphorylation (e.g., JNK1 [<a href=\"#bib67\">Wei et al., 2008</a>]) and proteins that are part of the core autophagy machinery, such as ULK1 and AMBRA1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fimia et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Di Bartolomeo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Russell et al., 2013</a>).

As reported, enforced expression of wild-type Beclin 1 rescued starvation-induced autophagy, as measured by decreased levels of p62, increased LC3-II conversion and increased numbers of GFP-LC3 puncta (a marker for autophagosomes) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). These readouts represented an increase in autophagic flux rather than a block in autophagosomal maturation, as treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 blocked p62 degradation and further increased LC3-II accumulation and numbers of GFP-LC3 puncta (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). In contrast, enforced expression of the Beclin 1 S90A mutant failed to induce autophagy in response to starvation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>), indicating that the Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation site is essential for autophagy induction in response to nutrient starvation. Moreover, a phosphomimetic mutant Beclin 1 S90E increased autophagy in basal conditions, suggesting that Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation may be sufficient to induce autophagy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>)."

In xenografts expressing wild-type Beclin 1, but not Beclin 1 S90A, there was a significant reduction in tumor p62 staining as compared with empty vector controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), suggesting increased levels of autophagy in the tumors.

Xenografts expressing wild-type Beclin 1 also had decreased cell death (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,F</a>), as measured by the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells. Together, these data confirm previous reports demonstrating that Beclin 1 simultaneously increases cell survival and decreases cell proliferation, resulting in a net decrease in tumor cell growth (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wei et al., 2013</a>), and provide new evidence that the S90 phosphorylation site is essential for the tumor suppressor function of Beclin 1."

Among a pool of 190 serine/threonine kinases, MAPKAPK3, also known as and herein referred to as MK3, was the only kinase with significant activity against the Beclin 1 peptide substrate (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Since there are other serine and threonine residues in the Beclin 1 83\u201397 peptide, we repeated the in vitro kinase assay with MK3 using a Beclin 1 peptide spanning from amino acid residues 83\u2013103 with either a wild-type sequence or an alanine substitution mutation at amino acid residue 90.

Furthermore, both MK2 and MK3 demonstrated in vitro kinase activity, resulting in Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation, using Flag-Beclin 1 purified from HEK293T cells as a substrate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). To investigate whether MK2 phosphorylates Beclin 1 S90 in cultured cells, we expressed either dominant-negative MK2 (MK2 K/R) (containing an arginine substitution at a lysine position at amino acid residue 76 that is conserved between MK2 and MK3), (<a href=\"#bib69\">Winzen et al., 1999</a>) or constitutively active MK2 (MK2 T205E/T317E; herein referred to as MK2 EE) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Engel et al., 1995</a>) in HeLa cells. Dominant-negative MK2 blocked starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation, whereas constitutively active MK2 increased Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation during nutrient-rich conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). By measuring phosphorylation of the downstream MK2/MK3 substrate, p-HSP27, we confirmed that starvation activated MK2/MK3 and that this was blocked by dominant negative MK2 expression. Taken together, these data indicate that MK2 and MK3 directly phosphorylate Beclin 1 S90 in vitro, and that MK2-like kinase activity also mediates starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation in cultured cells."

Also, we note that the decreased levels of total LC3 (with an increased ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I) in MK2 reconstituted cells during starvation conditions is consistent with a marked increase in autophagic flux, as LC3 (similar to p62) is degraded by the autophagy pathway.

The structure of the BCL2-related anti-apoptotic protein, BCL2L1 (which also inhibits autophagy through its interaction with Beclin 1), bound to the helical BH3 domain of Beclin 1 has been solved (<a href=\"#bib49\">Oberstein et al., 2007</a>) (PDV ID: 2P1L), as has the structure of a region of MK2 bound to its auto-inhibitory peptide (<a href=\"#bib42\">Meng et al., 2002</a>) (PDB ID: 1KWP). Based on sequence analysis suggesting that Beclin 1 residues 80\u2013104 that precede the BH3 domain are helical when bound to a suitable partner (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mei et al., 2014</a>), a model for this region was built by \u2018in silico\u2019 mutagenesis of the MK2-bound auto-inhibitory peptide to correspond to Beclin 1 residues 80\u201395, such that S90 was positioned optimally for phosphorylation. This helix was then extended to include Beclin 1 residues 96\u2013131 and BCL2L1 positioned by superposition of the bound Beclin 1 BH3 domain (residues 105\u2013128) on the modeled Beclin 1 extended helix. This model suggests that steric hindrance may prevent simultaneous binding of BCL2L1 (or BCL2) and MK2 to Beclin 1, thereby inhibiting MK2-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. Of note, residues 216\u2013236 and the N- and C-terminal regions of MK2 and BCL2L1 residues 26\u201381, were not present in the structures used to build this model, but in the full-length proteins these residues likely result in additional steric conflicts (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

While AMPK activates components of the autophagy machinery during glucose starvation (phosphorylating ULK1, Beclin 1, and VPS34), it does not appear to regulate the Beclin 1/VPS34 complex in response to complete (nitrogen and glucose) starvation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2013</a>).

A previous study showed that Beclin 1 S90 is phosphorylated during starvation and may function in autophagy (based on a ubiquitin-p62 degradation assay) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fogel et al., 2013</a>), but did not identify the kinase(s) responsible for this phosphorylation. In the present study, we found that alanine substitution of Beclin 1 serine 90 is sufficient to block detection of starvation-induced Beclin 1 phosphorylation, and sufficient to block Beclin 1-mediated rescue of starvation-induced autophagy in multiple different <i>beclin 1</i>-deficient cells using multiple different autophagic flux assays. The structurally and functionally-related p38 MAPK-activated protein kinase family members, MK2 and MK3 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cargnello and Roux, 2011</a>), but not the more distant family member, MK5, are strong inducers of Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. MK2 and MK3 phosphorylate a Beclin 1 peptide spanning S90 in vitro; MK2 and MK3 phosphorylate Beclin 1 immunoprecipitated from cells in vitro; dominant negative MK2 blocks starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation and constitutively active MK2 induces Beclin 1 S90 starvation during basal conditions; and MEFs from <i>MK2/MK3</i> knockout mice are deficient in starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation.

MK3 was discovered independently through a yeast two-hybrid screen for p38-interacting proteins (<a href=\"#bib39\">McLaughlin et al., 1996</a>) and through an analysis of genes commonly deleted in small-cell lung cancer (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sithanandam et al., 1996</a>). The substrate spectrum of MK2 and MK3 are virtually indistinguishable, and both enzymes modulate proteins involved in cytokine production, endocytosis, actin remodeling, cell migration, cell cycle control, chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional regulation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cargnello and Roux, 2011</a>). The role of MK2 and MK3 in LPS-induced inflammatory signaling is well-established in vivo; <i>MK2</i> knockout mice show increased resistance to endotoxic shock and increased susceptibility to infections (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kotlyarov et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lehner et al., 2002</a>) and this phenotype is exacerbated by simultaneous deletion of <i>MK3</i> (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ronkina et al., 2007</a>)<i>.</i> To our knowledge, MK2 and MK3 have not been previously linked to starvation-induced stress responses or to phosphorylation of specific substrates involved in starvation-induced stress response pathways such as autophagy. The newly described role of these kinases in regulating starvation-induced autophagy raises the possibility that this arm of the MAPKAPK family (sometimes referred to as the \u2018p38 module\u2019) may have evolved to integrate autophagy induction with diverse other cellular functions required for cellular adaption to stress."

The basis for the apparent discrepancy between this previous report and our current findings may reflect that p38\u03b1 functions differently in different cell types or may reflect other differences in experimental design. For example, we did not directly examine the effects of p38\u03b1 overexpression or p38\u03b1 siRNA knockdown on MK2/MK3 activation and autophagy; instead, we used a dominant-negative p38\u03b1 plasmid. One possibility is that there may be compensatory activation of different p38 isoforms that have different substrate signaling specificity in different experiments. In support of the concept that different p38 isoforms have different effects on starvation-induced MK2/MK3 activation, we found that dominant-negative p38\u03b2, but not dominant-negative p38\u03b3, also blocks starvation-induced MK2/MK3 activation (unpublished data). Another possibility is that p38\u03b1 may function upstream of MK2/MK3 in amino acid starvation, but its effects on other substrates may, in some contexts, counterbalance such effects in terms of autophagy regulation. Given our findings that dominant negative p38\u03b1 blocks starvation-induced MK2/MK3 activation, further studies are warranted to more clearly define the role of this signaling event in amino acid starvation-induced autophagy."

These data are consistent with predictions from a recent EM reconstitution of the ordered domains of the PI3KC3-C1 complex (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baskaran et al., 2014</a>). The architecture of the EM reconstituted complex predicts that signaling inputs at the N-terminus of Beclin 1 are likely to function in the allosteric regulation of its lipid kinase activity. There are no direct interactions between ATG14 and Beclin 1 and VPS34; however, the unstructured N-terminal region of Beclin 1 is predicted to be in proximity to the catalytic subunit of VPS34, leading to the proposal that signals in the region of the Beclin 1 N-terminus regulate the activity of VPS34 lipid kinase domain. We speculate that MK2/MK3-dependent phosphorylation of Beclin 1 S90 may function to initiate autophagy precisely through the mechanism predicted by the recently solved structure of the PI3KC3-C1 complex, that is, through allosteric interactions that increase the activity of the VPS34 lipid kinase domain."

Despite the importance of BCL2/BCL2L1 as negative regulators of autophagy, little is understood about the precise molecular mechanism by which their binding to Beclin 1 inhibits its autophagy function. The BH3 domain is in the N-terminal half of Beclin 1 and is not required for interaction with ATG14 or VPS34 or for the autophagy function of Beclin 1. Homodimerization of Beclin 1 favors binding BCL2/BCL2L1 and disfavors binding ATG14 or UVRAG (<a href=\"#bib47\">Noble et al., 2008</a>), but the temporal order of Beclin 1 homodimerization and binding BCL2/BCL2L1 are not known.

These results show that the amounts of the different Beclin 1 constructs in each subcellular fraction (cytosol, mitochondrial-enriched fraction, microsomal fraction) are similar and do not vary in response to starvation. We observed similar findings for ATG14. For VPS34, although there are some differences in the different lanes, we did not observe any consistent pattern in several repeat experiments with respect to amounts of VPS34 in the microsomal fraction during starvation or in cells expressing the different Beclin 1 constructs. Thus, we do not believe that Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation increases the membrane binding of the Beclin 1/VPS34/ATG14 complex.

To strengthen this claim, we have added to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> the quantification of multiple different experiments examining the VPS34 lipid kinase activity associated with wild-type Beclin 1, Beclin S90A, and Beclin 1 S90E (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a> of revised manuscript). These results clearly show that, despite similar levels of VPS34 in immunoprecipitates, there is a significant defect in Beclin 1-associated VPS34 kinase activity during starvation when Beclin 1 is lacking the S90 phosphorylation site. In addition, there is a significant increase in baseline as well as starvation-induced Beclin 1-associated VPS34 kinase activity in cells expressing the Beclin 1 S90E phosphomimetic mutant. Of note, we have added a new section to the Discussion section to highlight that we believe the mechanism by which Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation induces autophagy is by stimulating VPS34 lipid kinase activity. This observation is particularly timely in view of the recent <i>eLife</i> publication by Baskaran et al. (2015) which described the EM reconstitution of the ordered domains of the Beclin 1/ATG15/VPS15/VPS34 complex, and predicted that signaling input from the disordered N-terminal region of Beclin 1 was likely to result in allosteric regulation of the VPS34 lipid kinase domain."

The best-characterized kinase that activates MK2/MK3 is, as stated, p38 MAPK. There have also been some claims that MK2/MK3 can be activated by JNK. For these reasons, we evaluated the effects of both dominant-negative p38\u03b1 and dominant-negative JNK1 on starvation-induced MK2 activation (as measured by western blot detection of an MK2 band shift and phosphorylation of the downstream MK2 substrate, HSP27), as well as on Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. Our results, shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>, indicate that dominant-negative p38\u03b1 inhibits starvation-induced MK2 activation, Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation, and autophagy. Dominant-negative JNK1 also inhibits starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation and autophagy (presumably due to its inhibition of Bcl\u20132/Beclin 1 disruption as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wei et al., 2008</a>, Molecular Cell) and our findings in this manuscript showing that Bcl\u20132 binding to Beclin 1 blocks Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation); however, in contrast to dominant-negative p38\u03b1, dominant-negative JNK1 does not block starvation-induced MK2 activation. Thus, these results suggest that p38\u03b1, not JNK1, is indeed the kinase that functions upstream of MK2/MK3 in amino acid starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. To further confirm that MK2 functions downstream of p38 in amino acid starvation, we also evaluated whether constitutively active MK2 could reverse the inhibitory effects of dominant negative p38\u03b1 on Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. Our results, shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>, indicate that constitutively active MK2 blocks the inhibitory effects of dominant negative MK2 on starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. Taken together, these results suggest that p38\u03b1 MAPK functions upstream to activate MK2-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation and autophagy during amino acid starvation."

We also note that other studies report a positive role for p38\u03b1 MAPK in autophagy induction, including in response to glucose starvation (Moruno-Manch\u00f3n et al., 2013, Biochem J), IFN\u03b3 stimulation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Matsuzawa et al., 2012</a>, J Immunol; Matsuzawa et al., 2014, Immunology), reservatrol treatment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 2014</a>, J Cell Physiol), and accumulation of a mutant glial acidic fibrillary protein (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tang et al., 2008</a>, Hum Mol Genet). In the revised Discussion, we have discussed possible reasons for apparently discrepant findings in different studies, as well as cautioned that there is a need for further studies of p38\u03b1 MAPK-regulation of starvation-induced autophagy. Unfortunately, within the scope of the present paper, it is not possible to thoroughly examine this issue and resolve the basis for discrepant reports in the literature."

Therefore, we postulated that bafilomycin A1 might induce Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation as a consequence of generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), presumably as a consequence of its inhibition of vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPases (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yokomakura et al., 2012</a>, J Toxicol Sci; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhdanov et al., 2011</a>, Cell Mol Life Sci). To address whether bafilomycin A1-mediated ROS generation was responsible for Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation, we evaluated whether this event was blocked by concurrent treatment with an ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Our results indicate that bafilomycin A1 induces S90 phosphorylation of endogenous Beclin 1 in HeLa cells and that this is blocked by pretreatment with NAC. These results are shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a> of the revised manuscript. Of note, we performed these experiments in HeLa cells to confirm that bafilomycin A1-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation occurs on endogenous Beclin 1, as the experiments in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> involve the measurement of S90 phosphorylation of transfected Beclin 1 (in MCF7 cells and U2OS) and we wanted to exclude the possibility that bafilomycin A1-induced S90 phosphorylation was an artifact of exogenous Beclin 1 expression."
