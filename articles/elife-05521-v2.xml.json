Here, we systematically assessed the expression and function of <i>Angiopoietin-1</i> (<i>Angpt1</i>) in bone marrow. <i>Angpt1</i> was not expressed by osteoblasts. <i>Angpt1</i> was most highly expressed by HSCs, and at lower levels by c-kit<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors, megakaryocytes, and Leptin Receptor<sup>+</sup> (LepR<sup>+</sup>) stromal cells. Global conditional deletion of <i>Angpt1</i>, or deletion from osteoblasts, LepR<sup><i>+</i></sup> cells, <i>Nes-cre</i>-expressing cells, megakaryocytes, endothelial cells or hematopoietic cells in normal mice did not affect hematopoiesis, HSC maintenance, or HSC quiescence. Deletion of <i>Angpt1</i> from hematopoietic cells and LepR<sup>+</sup> cells had little effect on vasculature or HSC frequency under steady-state conditions but accelerated vascular and hematopoietic recovery after irradiation while increasing vascular leakiness. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and LepR<sup>+</sup> stromal cells regulate niche regeneration by secreting Angpt1, reducing vascular leakiness but slowing niche recovery."

Here, we systematically assessed the expression and function of <i>Angiopoietin-1</i> (<i>Angpt1</i>) in bone marrow. <i>Angpt1</i> was not expressed by osteoblasts. <i>Angpt1</i> was most highly expressed by HSCs, and at lower levels by c-kit<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors, megakaryocytes, and Leptin Receptor<sup>+</sup> (LepR<sup>+</sup>) stromal cells. Global conditional deletion of <i>Angpt1</i>, or deletion from osteoblasts, LepR<sup><i>+</i></sup> cells, <i>Nes-cre</i>-expressing cells, megakaryocytes, endothelial cells or hematopoietic cells in normal mice did not affect hematopoiesis, HSC maintenance, or HSC quiescence. Deletion of <i>Angpt1</i> from hematopoietic cells and LepR<sup>+</sup> cells had little effect on vasculature or HSC frequency under steady-state conditions but accelerated vascular and hematopoietic recovery after irradiation while increasing vascular leakiness. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and LepR<sup>+</sup> stromal cells regulate niche regeneration by secreting Angpt1, reducing vascular leakiness but slowing niche recovery."

Angpt1 is known to regulate blood vessels in the bone marrow, and one influential study had previously suggested that bone cells produce Angpt1, which promotes and regulates the maintenance of the stem cells within the niche. However, this previous study did not directly test this. Thus, it was not clear whether Angpt1 promotes the regeneration of the stem cells themselves or if it regulates the rebuilding of the niche."

These experiments showed where the protein is produced, and unexpectedly revealed that the bone cells do not make Angpt1. Instead, it is the stem cells and the stromal cells in the niche that made the protein. Further experiments showed that deleting the gene for Angpt1 from mice, or just from their bone cells, did not affect blood cell production; nor did it affect the maintenance or regulation of the stem cells."

Some of these irradiated mice had been genetically engineered to lack Angpt1; and, in these mice, blood stem cells and blood cell production recovered more quickly than in mice with Angpt1. The blood vessels in the niche also grew back more quickly in the irradiated mice that lacked Angpt1. However, these regenerated blood vessels were leaky. This suggests that blood stem cells produce Angpt1 to slow the recovery of the niche and reduce leakage from the blood vessels. Thus, blood stem cells can regulate the regeneration of the niches that maintain them."

A BAC clone containing the <i>Angpt1</i> genomic region was used to generate the targeting vector by recombineering.

Sequence conservation among species was examined to avoid disrupting conserved intronic regulatory elements.

Based on both Dextran-FITC live-imaging and Evans blue extravasation, cavtratin significantly reduced vascular leakiness in both control and Mx1 \u2192 Lepr recipient mice (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>). However, cavtratin administration did not significantly affect the recovery of bone marrow cellularity or LSK cell numbers in the bone marrow of control or Mx1 \u2192 Lepr recipients (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D</a>).

We first counted the total number of sinusoids in the section. Sinusoids were identified in these sections based on vessel morphology and bright VE-cadherin staining (VE-cadherin staining was dimmer in arterioles and capillaries). We then counted the number of regressed sinusoids in the same sections to arrive at the percentage of regressed sinusoids. Regressed sinusoids (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) were distinguished from non-regressed sinusoids (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) by being larger in diameter and having few hematopoietic cells around them."

In particular, the reviewers commented favorably on the rigorous quality of the study and the clarity of the writing. However, each of the reviewers raised some concerns, which you will want to address in revising the work. Here, I point to reviewer #1's major points, as resolving them does seem to be important to make the conclusions that you do. In fact, as pointed out by both reviewers 1 and 2, most effects do seem to be mediated by LepR+ stromal cells, rather than HSCs/progenitors. To unequivocally resolve this point, it seems reasonable to address whether the Ang1 knockout affects stromal cells in the bone marrow directly or indirectly, and in particular whether any of the cellular changes in the Mx1-Cre Ang1fl/fl bone marrow, when transplanted into LepR+ stromal Ang1 knockout recipients can promote HSC and vasculature regeneration that is HSC/HSC progeny independent. As pointed out by reviewers 1 and 3, it is important to determine whether Ang1, Ang2 or Tie2 expression change upon irradiation and upon transplantation during recovery. As the reviewers suggest, a transplantation experiment with just HSCs and their downstream lineages is needed to assess whether these proteins from HSCs/progenitors have an effect on their niche or whether the effects come solely from LepR+ stromal cells. Reviewer 3 also notes the sometimes opposing roles of Ang1 and Ang2, making this all the more important to investigate and resolve."

They demonstrated that although Ang1 is dispensable for HSC maintenance under steady condition, Ang1 delays HSC regeneration and bone marrow vasculature recovery after irradiation. Overall, this study represents a comprehensive analysis of Ang1's function in the HSC niche. The analysis is rigorous, and the manuscript is well written. How niche recovery is regulated after injury is an important topic which remains poorly understood.

These data suggest that Angpt1 expression by megakaryocyte lineage cells has little effect on hematopoietic and vascular recovery after irradiation. Together, our data demonstrate that Angpt1 expression by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells regulates hematopoietic and vascular recovery after irradiation, along with Angpt1 expressed by LepR<sup>+</sup> stromal cells."

In these thin optical sections, we first counted the total number of sinusoids in the section. Sinusoids were identified in these sections based on vessel morphology and bright VE-cadherin staining (VE-cadherin staining was dimmer in arterioles and capillaries). We then counted the number of regressed sinusoids in the same sections to arrive at the percentage of regressed sinusoids, as shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>.
