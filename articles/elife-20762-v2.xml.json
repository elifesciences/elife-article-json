That is, Net does not act as a chemoattractant nor does <i>Fra</i> act as a chemoattractant receptor. In addition, we present evidence suggesting that R8 growth cones can recognize the target layer without <i>Net-Fra</i>. Instead, Netrin, DCC, and TRIM9, a signaling component directly downstream from DCC (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Morikawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Song et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Winkle et al., 2016</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2014</a>), are essential for attachment of a single leading process extended from R8 growth cones to the target layer. We propose that R8 growth cones reach and recognize the target layer independent of Fra, adhere to the target layer in a Fra-dependent step, and this adhesion is consolidated by a TRIM9-dependent step. These findings favor the notion that in <i>Drosophila Net</i> mediates adhesion to neuronal processes or the extracellular matrix (ECM) at the target layer rather than promoting directed outgrowth to or recognition of the target layer."

Alternatively, R8s could be increasing their lengths in concert with the growing medulla. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the reach of R8 projections to a fiducial marker for an outer medulla layer, the Dm3 neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). In the adult, Dm3 processes project across columns to weave a meshwork at the M2/M3 layer boundary, a position that corresponds to 67 \u00b1 5% of the depth of R8 projections (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). Between 45 and 60 hAPF, the Dm3-defined layer is gradually displaced from M0 at an average rate of 0.9 \u03bcm/hr (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Since the projections of these neurons extend orthogonally to medulla columns, the measured movement captures the expansion of the neuropil. During <i>elongation</i>, the ratio of the distance between M0 and the Dm3 layer and the reach of individual R8 projections is 61 \u00b1 4% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that the R8s are increasing in length in concert with the growing neuropil. This result indicates that the target layer is reached at <i>stabilization</i>. It is possible that R8 axons actively and independently <i>elongate</i> to match the growth of the tissue. However, both <i>elongation</i> and medulla expansion continue through pre-synaptic differentiation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2014</a> and below), arguing that the concerted growth is supported by attachments to neighboring cells and the target layer. We conclude that R8 projections recognize and become attached to their targets before <i>elongation</i>, at the <i>stabilization</i> step, and are stretched in length as the target layer moves away from M0."

At the onset of <i>transformation</i>, the original growth cone volume at M0 shrinks while the thin process fills out. The progress of <i>transformation</i> is not purely anterograde. In many cases, the apparent flow of material from the growth cone into the proximal length of the process and the expansion at the distal tip are distinguishable (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). In the following\u00a0~5 hr, the R8 terminal takes on its mature form, which will eventually contain\u00a0~50 en passant synapses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Takemura et al., 2013</a>). To ask how <i>transformation</i> relates to pre-synaptic differentiation, we studied the distribution of Brp in R8 projections using the STaR system (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2014</a>), which enables cell-type specific tagging of proteins expressed at endogenous levels. We found that this marker for pre-synaptic active zones begins to populate the length of the R8 projection with the onset of <i>transformation</i>, following the anterograde expansion to eventually reach the expanded tip at the target layer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>). Thus, while <i>transformation</i> is linked to pre-synaptic differentiation, the expansion of the R8 tip at the target layer is an earlier and distinct sub-step."

The spread in this distribution is partly due to the 3D organization of this tissue; the absolute distance between layers changes along the two principal axes of the neuropil. Wild-type R8 projections, when expressed as a fraction of the distance between M0 and M6, reveal a more narrowly defined (0.75 \u00b1 0.05) target layer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, bottom graph). In addition to reducing variation within one brain, this normalization approach also enables more reliable quantitative comparisons to be made between R8s from different animals and different genetic backgrounds.

All three components fall short of the target layer.

First, we ablated L3s through cell-type specific RNAi-mediated knock-down of a neurotrophic receptor. This experiment was originally published by our group where we showed that removal of all L3s led to a loss of Net from the M3 layer (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pecot et al., 2014</a>). To compare the development of R8s with and without a home-column L3 in the same brain, we reduced the efficiency of the knock-down to achieve a partial ablation of the L3 array (~80% loss with\u00a0~20% surviving through eclosion). In this setup, all R8s with an L3 in the home column target as wild type. With R8s lacking a home column L3, we did observe targeting defects, but the phenotype was too variable to discern general patterns of growth cone behavior and draw mechanistic conclusions. We suspect that ablating L3, a major resident of the M3 layer, is too blunt a perturbation with pleiotropic consequences that go beyond removing a single secreted ligand."

We did not observe any overt R8 phenotypes in this genetic background. The principal caveat here is that with MARCM in the lamina, mutant neurons appear as singlets or in small patches in an array of wild-type cells. We could not achieve mutant L3 patches large enough to ensure that any R8 sharing a column with a <i>Net</i> null L3 did not also neighbor at least one wildtype L3. Indeed, at 40 hAPF, L3 growth cones are very large along the dorso-ventral axis and extend into adjacent columns. Thus, it is likely that Net is contributed from wild-type L3 growth cones in neighboring columns."

At this point, <i>fra<sup>null</sup></i> development diverges from wild type in two respects. First, the distal tips of <i>fra<sup>null</sup></i> processes do not expand (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a,b,g</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). That is, while subtle dilations or other distinct structures may appear at this active site, these are invariably transient and are remodeled within 20\u201330 min to restore the thin morphology of the targeting process. Second, mutant processes do not stably adhere to the target layer. Instead, for the next\u00a0~10 hr (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>), as wild-type R8s passively elongate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5h</a>), <i>fra<sup>null</sup></i> R8s actively follow a slowly advancing front in the medulla (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5g,i</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), before they ultimately retract. That is, mutant R8s continue to extend and retract their thin processes, as their reach into the medulla increases over time. We term this behavior <i>tracking</i>."

Greater than 95% of <i>fra<sup>null</sup></i> R8s yielded <i>tracking</i> trendlines that are consistent with target layer trendlines of their wild-type counterparts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5j</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c,d</a>). Thus, <i>fra<sup>null</sup></i> R8s track the target layer. This indicates that mutant R8 growth cones recognize one\u00a0or\u00a0more determinant of target layer specificity. The observation of <i>tracking</i> uncouples target layer recognition and attachment. In R8s, target layer recognition does not require the <i>Net-Fra</i> pathway."

The progress of <i>transformation</i> is slow and fails to reach the target layer in the vast majority of <i>fra<sup>null</sup></i> growth cones before the final retraction after <i>tracking</i> (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). That is, while synaptogenesis is affected in <i>fra<sup>null</sup></i> mutants, this is a downstream consequence of the earliest observable phenotypes\u2014lack of tip expansion and stable attachment. The penetrance of the loss of target layer adhesion in <i>fra<sup>null</sup></i> growth cones is complete, consistent with our quantitative analysis of the adult phenotype. Live imaging of R8 targeting in <i>Net</i> null animals revealed similar behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In summary, the <i>Fra-Net</i> pathway is required for the attachment of the R8 terminal to M3 (Figure 8a).

Each R8 growth cone in all three mutant backgrounds studied\u2014<i>Net</i>, <i>fra</i>, and <i>Trim9</i>\u2014extends a single process which reaches the M3 layer as in wild type. The targeting defects observed in the adult arise from retraction from M3 as a consequence of the lack of the stable association and morphological transformation of the tip of the R8 growth cone at the peak of the Net gradient. We note that given the cellular and molecular complexity of the medulla neuropil, retraction may also reflect the presence of repulsive factors in M3 uncovered through loss of Net-based attachment. This, however, is not consistent with the <i>tracking</i> behavior of mutant R8s; the persistent association of the tip of R8 growth cones with the target layer (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) is difficult to reconcile with a repulsive cue at M3.

Adhesion is also a recognized output of Net signaling, particularly in non-neuronal systems (<a href=\"#bib41\">Srinivasan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yebra et al., 2003</a>). Biochemical and cell biological studies using dissociated vertebrate neurons or neural explants suggest that these different functions may share a fundamental mechanistic similarity. Structurally, Net can be described in three domains. The two N-terminal domains interact with cognate receptors, including DCC (<a href=\"#bib19\">Keino-Masu et al., 1996</a>). The C-terminal domain of Net is highly charged and mediates non-specific adsorption to cell surfaces, ECM components, and to tissue culture substrates (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kappler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Moore et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yebra et al., 2003</a>). <i>In\u00a0vitro</i>, substrate-bound Net promotes adsorption of DCC-expressing cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Shekarabi\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005</a>) and the Net-DCC interaction can withstand measurable pulling forces (<a href=\"#bib27\">Moore et al., 2009</a>). Net\u2019s \u2018stickiness\u2019 can be reduced by masking the charge with heparin or removing the C-terminal domain altogether (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moore et al., 2012</a>). These manipulations do not alter the ligand\u2019s interaction with DCC, but significantly reduce the neuronal response to Net in classic <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> assays of Net-DCC function, including growth cone expansion, axon outgrowth, and turning (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moore et al., 2012</a>). For example, in the explant turning assay, a cluster of Net-secreting cells abutting a dissected embryonic spinal cord can attract extending commissural axons over a distance of some 200 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kennedy et al., 1994</a>). Without the C-terminal domain, the range over which Net can attract axons is markedly reduced (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moore et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with the importance of substrate binding to the function of externally supplied Net, most of the endogenous Net in the developing mouse spinal cord is cell- or ECM-bound (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kennedy\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006</a>). Together, these observations support the notion that \u201cgrowth cones pull directly on the cues that guide them\u201d (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moore et al., 2012</a>), thereby unifying the chemoattraction and adhesion roles of Net-DCC in the concept of haptotaxis, or motility through traction."

UNC-6 \u2013 UNC-40 signaling is required for the efficient completion of this process. In a series of studies using live imaging, Sherwood and colleagues demonstrated that UNC-6 localized to the basement membrane stabilizes UNC-40 clustering in the AC, which, in turn, directs polarized F-actin production to the basal surface of this cell (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hagedorn et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ziel et al., 2009</a>). Without UNC-6, UNC-40 can still form clusters and promote actin assembly, but these patches of activity are transient and randomly positioned around the cell periphery (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). MADD-2, the <i>C. elegans</i> homolog of Trim9, is also required in the AC to maintain stable and appropriately polarized F-actin patches; without MADD-2, basal patches can be transient, mis-localized actin assembly is observed, and, ultimately, basement membrane invasion is compromised (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). The parallels between the use of Net-DCC-Trim9 in development by R8 and the non-neuronal AC\u2014to effect a spatially constrained adhesion or polarization response at an acute presentation of Net (i.e. gradient peak for R8 and basement membrane enrichment for the AC)\u2014raises the possibility that adhesion may be a widely conserved cell biological output of this signaling module."

If commissural axons can, indeed, reach the midline without this signaling module\u2014that is, if the mutant phenotypes, as in the R8 system, arise due to retraction rather than a lack of attraction, the role of Net-Fra would be better described as enabling the axons to traverse the dense midline neuropil. Alternatively, commissural growth cones may extend towards the midline via haptotaxis, growth via traction (and hence adhesion) along a pathway of increasing levels of Net bound to the surface of midline glia or associated ECM. Thus, given our current state of knowledge of midline crossing, it is possible that Net-Fra act through an adhesive mechanism in this system."

In <i>Net</i>, <i>fra</i>, and <i>Trim9</i> mutants, these projections are severely reduced or missing. There are three different sub-classes of C4da neurons and each subclass elaborates a characteristic number of contralateral projections. Neurons with more contralateral projections express higher levels of Trim9. Furthermore, overexpression of Trim9 produces ectopic projections in a dose-dependent manner. This overexpression phenotype is completely suppressed in a <i>fra<sup>null</sup></i> background (<a href=\"#bib29\">Morikawa et al., 2011</a>). Given what we know of Trim9 function in stabilizing adhesion downstream of Net-Fra in R8s and polarization in the AC, the C4da results are consistent with Trim9 controlling the fine-tuning of midline crossing probability.

This is by contrast to the diffusible gradient view supported by the original conception of long-range chemoattraction and the results of turning assays of vertebrate growth cones <i>in\u00a0vitro</i>. However, both at the midline and in the medulla, tethered Net is present as a gradient that peaks at the targets of guidance, and in the absence of studies testing the relevance of this cell-bound gradient to guidance, the distinction between the short- and long- range functions of Net-DCC remained unclear. Net is a secreted molecule of the laminin superfamily and, in principle, can diffuse to form a gradient.

That is, the evidence against gradient-based chemoattraction in R8 targeting does not rule out a role for this mechanism in other <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> contexts. If Net does act in a graded fashion in other systems, we suggest, in agreement with the work from the Sheetz lab, that it does so not as a soluble factor, but rather as a substrate-bound molecule that influences growth cone behavior through contact. The distribution of the ligand may be determined by localized expression at a single source followed by diffusion and adsorption. Alternatively, a track of cells may form a gradient by expressing and presenting different levels of Net on their surfaces. Thus at a mechanistic level, we propose that, <i>in\u00a0vivo</i>, DCC responds to immobilized, not soluble, Net. This initial adhesive interaction may stabilize attachment as in the case of R8 or, alternatively, this may promote traction for growth cone motility along a surface (i.e. haptotaxis)."

A typical multi-channel confocal stack of the medulla measures 150\u00a0x\u00a0150\u00a0x\u00a0180 \u00b5m and has voxel dimensions of 0.29\u00a0x\u00a00.29\u00a0x\u00a00.4 \u00b5m. In a pre-processing step, all channels are scaled in the z-dimension to achieve unit voxel aspect ratio. The Mab24B10 channel (i.e. all R cells) is used in the deconstruction. R7 axon terminals are the deepest-reaching visible features; a mask of the R7 axon tips is generated by manually cleaning up the image. Local intensity maxima in the original image are selected with this mask and the resulting point cloud is used to define the continuous 3D surface of the M6 layer. The bundles of R cell axons that stretch across the outer medulla surface increases the complexity of the image at M0; a more involved approach is required to define this layer. The area bounding the footprint of the R7 projections in M6 is divided into 50\u201372 regions, and, for each region, columnar volumes orthogonal to the M6 surface are extracted from the image. Intensity profiles along the column axis of these volumes are used to find local peaks, which are classified according to magnitude and their distance from the M6 surface. These two parameters are used to identify the peaks that reside in the M0 layer; the M0 surface is built from a point cloud derived from the selected peaks. A similar approach is used to compute the Dm4 surface. To define the medulla columns, a sequence of masks laminating the space between the M0 and M6 surfaces are used to generate maximum intensity projections (MIPs) of the Mab24B10 image. The cross-sections of R7-R8 projections are identified as local intensity maxima in these MIPs. Across the MIP sequence, the intensity maxima are grouped into individual tracks that define the position and orientation of the medulla columns. This information is used to create single panel MIPs of individual R8 axons from the R8 channel. The tips of R8 projections are marked manually on the MIPs and the input is used to calculate 3D distances to the M0 and M6 surfaces. Up to 500 R8s per medulla were scored with this approach.

For WT growth cones, a subset of the data in each window was selected by fitting a lower-bound cubic spline to the data. The complexity of the spline (i.e. number of cubic functions used) was increased until 30% of the data points were within 0.5 \u00b5m of the curve. These spline-proximal points were used to define a line using the Thiel-Sen estimator method. The intercept of the line was adjusted so as to give 90% of all the data in the time window positive residuals. For <i>fra<sup>null</sup></i> growth cones, an upper-bound spline was fit to the data in each time window and, again, the complexity of the spline was increased until 30% of the data points were within 0.5 \u00b5m of the curve. The best-fit line to the spline-proximal points was refined using a 30% subset with the smallest standard deviation in their residuals to the line. For both classes of growth cones, the optimum trendline from among the candidates was selected using the product of three weight functions. The first two of these are normal distributions, which rank the slope and intercept of the trendlines based on parameters derived from the average tip trace curves of WT growth cones (e.g. blue mean and errors in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). The third is an exponential decay function that ranks the standard deviation of the residuals to each candidate trendline. This analysis was written in Matlab (Mathworks) with a critical script sourced form the Mathworks File Exchange repository (<a href=\"#bib9\">D\u2019Errico, 2009</a>)."

The pairing of the <i>ey-3.5</i> promoter with this higher efficiency variant of FLP largely preserves its specificity in the eye disc; in\u00a0~15% of the optic lobes we also noted recombination in lamina and medulla cell precursors. In our analysis, we did not detect a subclass of <i>fra</i> R8s with alternate developmental progression, suggesting that the possible existence of sporadic <i>fra</i> mutants of other cell classes does not change our main conclusions. The ACT-GAL80 element is based on a new actin-derived pan-cell promoter (provided by Barret Pfeiffer, Rubin Lab, Janelia Farm Research Campus/HHMI). <i>fra</i> R8s are labeled with myr::tdTOM (not shown). STaR system is used to drive genotype-independent expression of myr::GFP in\u00a0~70% of R8s (see genotype description for 1d)."

The authors argue that this refutes gradient-based chemoattractive signaling by Netrin since the phenotype is only observed upon target contact. The counter model, provided by the authors, is that Netrin mediates target-dependent adhesion. In the absence of target-dependent adhesion, the growth cone collapses. This is the basis for a proposed over-turning the chemotactic gradient model. However, there is no direct evidence for this adhesive model in this system, only reference to the potential adhesive properties of Netrin in other systems. The authors adamantly support their model without excluding or entertaining other equally plausible ideas. This is where the authors should be more circumspect."

Indeed, it might be expected to cause a bypass of the target or cause increased growth cone elaboration, as it searched for the correct target. In essence, the growth cone collapse that the authors observe could equally be caused by unveiling a prominent contact-dependent repulsive cue that is normally overcome by the presence Netrin. If so, the observation of target-dependent growth cone collapse in the absence of Netrin is not evidence for a lack of a gradient of Netrin. Thus, in my view, this paper is an important addition to the literature, but does not effectively refute the existing model of Netrin function. Indeed, it is difficult to completely argue against early work in vitro showing secretion of Netrin acting at a distance in cell explants. Thus, it would be appropriate to consider models, such as the one suggested above \u2013 or others \u2013 that would also be consistent with the fundamental observation In essence, the absence of causal evidence is not evidence in favor their model."

While I agree with the authors that the evidence for netrin acting as a diffusible long-range signal in vivo remains to be proven, due to technical limitations, its long-range action in in vitro explants is quite strong. For example, in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> of the Kennedy et al. paper (Cell, 78:425, 1994), floor plate tissues or Cos cells transfected with Netrin, when placed on the side of the dorsal spinal cord explants, can cause commissural axons that otherwise grow ventrally to turn towards the side. Axons as far as 250 micrometers away from the source of netrin-expressing cells can be induced to turn. It is possible that secreted netrin is deposited on the substrate in the dorsal spinal cord explant and not freely diffusible, and axon turning is caused by preferring ever stronger force of adhesion to higher concentration of netrin. In this regard, adhesion and chemoattraction is not mutually exclusive. Adhesion may be a specific mechanism by which axons are attracted to its target. The authors may consider incorporating this in their Discussion."

Akin and Zipursky use live cell imaging to examine whether in R8s, net acts as a chemotaxic agent via <i>fra</i>. Using several germline and mosaic genetic approaches, the authors demonstrate that the initial extension of the R8 filopodial process towards the net-producing cell is not affected in these mutants. Instead, it is the stabilization of that extension that requires net and <i>fra</i>. While adhesion itself is not addressed by any of the experiments, the observations are consistent with a role for Net/<i>fra</i> in, not chemotaxis, but stabilization of the R8 projection."

As such, the gradient based chemoattraction model does not apply to R8 targeting. This is a strong conclusion; however, it is limited to the context of R8 targeting and the revised manuscript reflects this scope."

The data for this result is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. The slow and coordinated growth of R8 projections during <i>elongation</i> stand in sharp contrast to the fast and individualized dynamics of the <i>extension</i> stage. It is possible that the apparently coordinated growth is indeed due to active extension by each R8 projection. However, this extension happens while the growth cones are transforming into nascent axon terminals with pre-synaptic components assembling at future sites of synaptic contacts. This suggests that the R8 projection is no longer a motile growth cone and supports the notion that <i>elongation</i> represents passive lengthening in response to the expansion of the surrounding tissue. From this, we infer that R8 projections become attached to the target layer at the onset of <i>elongation</i>, i.e. at the <i>stabilization</i> step. In the interest of a streamlined main text, much of this detailed account was provided in Supplementary Discussion; it is now part of the main text (subsection \u201cLive imaging reveals that R8 targeting occurs via discrete steps\u201d, third paragraph)."

R8s growth cones exhibit this <i>tracking</i> behavior for an average of 10 hours before they ultimately retreat from the target layer. The retractions seen during and after <i>tracking</i> indicate that in contrast to wildtype, mutant R8s are not stably attached to the target layer. In addition to this dynamic phenotype, there is a morphological correlate to the loss of <i>stabilization</i>: the tips of mutant R8 processes do not expand.

We have now expanded on this (Discussion, third paragraph) to underscore the complexity of phenotypic analysis in the complex environment in the developing CNS. It does seem unlikely that retraction is a consequence of repulsion, however, as it is difficult to reconcile the persistent association of the R8 tip in mutants with the target layer (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) with a contact-dependent repulsive cue. That is, in the absence of DCC <i>tracking</i> growth cones often remain associated with target layer for hours. We note that this observation could only be appreciated through live imaging."

This study shows that substrate adsorption of Net is important to the neuronal response to Net in many classic in vitro assays, including growth cone expansion, axon outgrowth, and axon turning in embryonic spinal cord explants. While their results do not argue against the diffusibility of Net, they do suggest that the biological output of Net-DCC depends on immobilized ligand. As such, the classic view of chemoattraction by Net-DCC may be better thought of as haptotaxis, or motility through traction, rather than chemotaxis. From this perspective, the adhesion function we infer for Net-DCC in R8s is wholly consistent with the recognized role of Net-DCC in axon guidance."

While I agree with the authors that the evidence for netrin acting as a diffusible long-range signal in vivo remains to be proven, due to technical limitations, its long-range action in in vitro explants is quite strong. For example, in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> of the Kennedy et al. paper (Cell, 78:425, 1994), floor plate tissues or Cos cells transfected with Netrin, when placed on the side of the dorsal spinal cord explants, can cause commissural axons that otherwise grow ventrally to turn towards the side. Axons as far as 250 micrometers away from the source of netrin-expressing cells can be induced to turn. It is possible that secreted netrin is deposited on the substrate in the dorsal spinal cord explant and not freely diffusible, and axon turning is caused by preferring ever stronger force of adhesion to higher concentration of netrin. In this regard, adhesion and chemoattraction is not mutually exclusive. Adhesion may be a specific mechanism by which axons are attracted to its target.

The experiments presented on role of Net in R8 targeting were carried out in whole animal mutants by contrast to the cell type specific MARCM approach taken for <i>fra</i> and Trim9. In addition to <i>fra</i>, Net is a ligand for other receptors such as Unc-5 and Dscam and many cell types in addition to R8 are likely to be using this ligand during development. Indeed, we did report two additional cell types whose morphologies were altered in the whole animal Net null background. As such, we do not expect the observed R8 phenotypes to arise solely due to the absence of Net-Fra signaling in R8; pleitropy was expected and observed due to what is likely to be an altered and inhomogeneous medulla environment. In this context, the quantitative re-assessment of the mutant phenotypes and the epistasis analysis were critical in establishing that for R8 targeting removing either the ligand or the receptor were equivalent perturbations. These results justified our focus on the component with the cleaner genetics, <i>fra</i>, when identifying patterns of cell behavior and drawing mechanistic conclusions. The mutant phenotypes in the Net null background are broadly similar but there are more exceptions to each pattern. The example the reviewer noted is one such exception. As we note in the text, we do see transient dilations and other elaborations at the R8 tip in <i>fra</i> mutants as well; however, these differ from wildtype tip expansion in that they do not last. To us, the features noted by the reviewer look more like these transient dynamics than true tip expansion. The salient point is that, given the genetic background, it is not possible to ascribe such specific morphologies solely to a cell autonomous effect of the Net null mutation on R8 development. We did try a number of other approaches for a more \u2018surgical\u2019 removal of Net from the distal medulla; these are detailed in the Discussion. Unfortunately, these alternatives were not free from their own technical difficulties and caveats."
