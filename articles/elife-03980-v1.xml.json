In the original research paper (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bai et al., 2013</a>), the authors reported an important step forward in a technique known as electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), which can be used to study the structure of biological macromolecules at near-atomic resolution. In the Research Advance Sjors Scheres\u2014the corresponding author on the original paper\u2014reports how this new approach to cryo-EM can be used to study the structure of smaller macromolecules, which has the potential to open the door to a much broader range of biological insights (<a href=\"#bib4\">Kuehlbrandt, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Scheres, 2014</a>)."

Specifically, they have used the single-vesicle in vitro system described in the original article (<a href=\"#bib3\">Diao et al., 2012</a>) to better understand the role of the protein complexin in this process."

For example, attempts to replicate or extend a study might uncover limitations in the original work or they might substantially reinforce the initial investigation. Regardless of the direction of the new findings, it could be valuable for the research community to be made aware of how published research stands up to scrutiny, and would support current efforts to strengthen research reproducibility (<a href=\"#bib2\">Collins and Tabak, 2014</a>)."
