The fuzzy appearance of <i>Streptomyces</i> colonies is the result of the vegetative cells producing another type of cell called aerial hyphae that grow upwards into the air (<a href=\"#bib7\">McCormick and Fl\u00e4rdh, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Fl\u00e4rdh and Buttner 2009</a>). Subsequently, cells\u00a0of\u00a0a third type (spores) form long chains on the ends of these aerial hyphae. These spores are resistant to drying out and likely allow <i>Streptomyces</i> to passively spread to new environments through the action of water or air movement (<a href=\"#bib7\">McCormick and Fl\u00e4rdh, 2012</a>). Now, in eLife, Marie Elliot at McMaster University and colleagues \u2013 including Stephanie Jones as first author \u2013 report a new form of growth in <i>Streptomyces</i> termed \u201cexploratory growth\u201d (<a href=\"#bib4\">Jones et al., 2016</a>)."

During this time, the bacteria grown alone formed a normal sized colony typical of <i>Streptomyces</i>. However, in the presence of the yeast, the <i>S. venezuelae</i> colonies expanded rapidly and colonized the entire surface of the growth dish, engulfing the nearby yeast colony. In subsequent experiments, the cells produced during exploratory growth (dubbed \u201cexplorer\u201d cells) showed the ability to spread over abiotic surfaces including rocks (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and polystyrene barriers. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that, unlike vegetative cells, these explorer cells did not form branches and more closely resembled simple aerial hyphae."

Jones et al. found that neither of these sets of genes are required for exploratory growth of <i>S. venezuelae</i> in the presence of the yeast. This suggests that the explorer cell type is distinct from the previously known developmental pathways in <i>Streptomyces</i>. Furthermore, Jones et al. found that multiple <i>Streptomyces</i> species were capable of exploratory growth and that various fungal microbes had the ability to trigger this behavior."

The bacteria trigger this pH change themselves by releasing a volatile organic compound called trimethylamine, which is able to stimulate exploratory growth in <i>Streptomyces</i> over considerable distances. Trimethylamine also inhibits the growth of other bacteria that might compete with <i>S. venezuelae</i> in natural environments."

The explorer cells identified by Jones et al. offer <i>Streptomyces</i> an alternative means of escape from their normal life cycle and local environment in the face of competition. This makes intuitive sense, given that <i>Streptomyces</i> lack the ability to move (\u201cmotility\u201d) in the traditional sense (for example, by swimming, gliding or twitching). Taken together, the work of Jones et al. demonstrates a surprisingly dynamic strategy in which a \u2018non-motile\u2019 bacterium can use cues from other microbes, long-range signaling, and multicellularity to make a graceful exit when times get tough."
