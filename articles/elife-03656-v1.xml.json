Although a unique RNA structure has been proposed for the Rev-response element (RRE) responsible for viral mRNA export, how it recruits multiple HIV Rev proteins to form an export complex has been unclear. We show here that initial binding of Rev to the RRE triggers RNA tertiary structural changes, enabling further Rev binding and the rapid formation of a viral export complex. Analysis of the Rev-RRE assembly pathway using SHAPE-Seq and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveals two major steps of Rev-RRE complex formation, beginning with rapid Rev binding to a pre-organized region presenting multiple Rev binding sites. This step induces long-range remodeling of the RNA to expose a cryptic Rev binding site, enabling rapid assembly of additional Rev proteins into the RNA export complex. This kinetic pathway may help maintain the balance between viral replication and maturation."

Although a unique RNA structure has been proposed for the Rev-response element (RRE) responsible for viral mRNA export, how it recruits multiple HIV Rev proteins to form an export complex has been unclear. We show here that initial binding of Rev to the RRE triggers RNA tertiary structural changes, enabling further Rev binding and the rapid formation of a viral export complex. Analysis of the Rev-RRE assembly pathway using SHAPE-Seq and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveals two major steps of Rev-RRE complex formation, beginning with rapid Rev binding to a pre-organized region presenting multiple Rev binding sites. This step induces long-range remodeling of the RNA to expose a cryptic Rev binding site, enabling rapid assembly of additional Rev proteins into the RNA export complex. This kinetic pathway may help maintain the balance between viral replication and maturation."

First, Rev proteins rapidly bind to a pre-formed region of the RNA molecule where multiple binding sites are compactly organized. This causes the overall shape of the RNA to change, and exposes a previously hidden extra binding site for Rev proteins. More Rev proteins then quickly bind to the newly exposed site, before finally the two host proteins bind and the whole complex is exported from the nucleus."

Some evidence suggests that Rev is recruited to the RRE one molecule at a time (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pond et al., 2009</a>), while other data are consistent with recruitment in the form of a dimeric complex (<a href=\"#bib17\">Daugherty et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2010b</a>). Studies of the Rev-RRE assembly pathway have focused on the state of the RNA and protein components either alone or in the fully assembled complex (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cook et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mann et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Battiste et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Charpentier et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Watts et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Daugherty et al., 2010b</a>), or on the dynamics of Rev protein within the complex (<a href=\"#bib59\">Van Ryk and Venkatesan, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pond et al., 2009</a>). In the absence of information about structural changes in the RRE that might occur during association with Rev, contradicting Rev-RRE assembly models were proposed (<a href=\"#bib18\">Daugherty et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fang et al., 2013</a>). To address this problem, we interrogated the folding pathway of the RRE RNA during the course of Rev-RRE complex formation, both as a function of time and Rev association state. We find that three regions within the RRE, bridged by previously unidentified RNA tertiary interactions, exhibit sequential structural changes during RNA-protein assembly. Comparison of the kinetic and thermodynamic pathways of Rev-RRE complex formation suggests a two-step assembly mechanism beginning with Rev binding to a pre-organized RRE structure critical for enhanced binding rate. This interaction triggers rearrangement of long-range RNA contacts to facilitate higher-order Rev-RRE assembly. This complex promotes a switch to late HIV protein expression and packaging."

We note that the SHAPE data predict a rearrangement in the Stem III/IV and Stem V regions relative to previous models, yielding a modified secondary structure more similar to that of the RRE in SIV (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pollom et al., 2013</a>), which is used for mapping additional structural features and protein interactions detected in this study (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

                                "text": "Surprisingly, although predicted to be in a loop region, nucleotides 54-58 exhibit either low or no SHAPE reactivity, indicating that they could be constrained by tertiary contacts. To test whether this loop forms long-range interactions with another part of the RRE, we designed a 31-nt oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 54-84 (AS 54-84), which can efficiently invade and hybridize with the pre-folded RRE RNA to disrupt its local structure, and determined the SHAPE profile for the resulting RNA-oligo complex (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sztuba-Solinska and Le Grice, 2012</a>). The length of this oligonucleotide was determined experimentally to be the minimum required for stable association with the RNA, presumably due to competing stability of the RRE secondary structure in this region (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In addition to the Stem I region (around nucleotides 50-80 and 300-340), which was directly affected by the oligonucleotide binding, another segment covering nucleotides 100-113 showed significant changes in SHAPE reactivity, even though it is distant from the target region based solely on predicted secondary structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Results from toe-printing assays showed that AS 54-84 did not bind to a secondary site on the RRE (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), indicating the SHAPE change could be a result of long-range crosstalk. To confirm this, a 14-nt oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 100-113 (AS 100-113) was used in a reciprocal experiment to perturb its potential long-range contacts. A shorter oligonucleotide was used here because this segment is predicted to be more accessible for oligonucleotide hybridization based on thermodynamic predictions. Toe-printing assays again showed no secondary oligonucleotide binding on the RRE (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). This resulting RNA-oligo complex showed substantially altered SHAPE reactivity in several patches along the Stem I region, including patches spanning around nucleotides 50, 310, and 340 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Therefore, disruption of the tertiary structure in the Stem I region specifically affects the 100-113 segment and the converse is also observed. These results suggest the existence of a long-range structural contact between Stem I and nucleotides 100-113. No sequence complementarity exists between these two regions, indicating that any tertiary interaction may be more complex than direct base-pairing."

To test this, we used the antisense oligonucleotides described above (AS 54-84 or AS 100-113) to interfere with long-range interactions within the RRE and performed SAXS measurements on the resulting complexes. As expected, the RNA-oligo complexes showed markedly altered scattering patterns (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) and became more open and extended compared to the native RRE based on the Porod-Debye plot (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rambo and Tainer, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The <i>D</i><sub><i>max</i></sub> values for the resulting complexes also increased dramatically to 302 \u00c5 and 292 \u00c5, respectively. It has been reported that a 30-nt single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide shows a <i>D</i><sub><i>max</i></sub> value of \u223c90 \u00c5 under similar Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<a href=\"#bib41\">Meisburger et al., 2013</a>), indicating that even if free oligonucleotide remained in the system after extensive washes, it would not bias the distance distribution functions (<i>P(r)</i>) to a longer range. Therefore, the large variations in the <i>P(r)</i> indicate a substantial conformational change in the RRE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Stem I and 100-113 regions are linked through long-range interactions, which enables the RRE to fold into a compact structure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We speculate that the sharp bend in the RNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) results from a series of bends that occur throughout the noncanonical parts of Stem I."

It also includes the three-way junction of Stems IIA, IIB and IIC. According to earlier reports, Region1 is likely recognized by a Rev dimer (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zemmel et al., 1996</a>), with one molecule binding in the widened RNA major groove at the primary binding site (<a href=\"#bib5\">Battiste et al., 1996</a>) and the other binding at the three-way junction (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zemmel et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Van Ryk and Venkatesan, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Daugherty et al., 2008</a>) (Jayaraman et al., unpublished manuscript). Region2 covers the previously identified secondary Rev binding site (<a href=\"#bib17\">Daugherty et al., 2008</a>). By comparing the footprint of this region with that of Region1 together with a previous truncation study (<a href=\"#bib59\">Van Ryk and Venkatesan, 1999</a>), we infer that Region2 could accommodate at least a Rev dimer. Region3, a previously undefined Rev binding site, is located in the center of Stem I (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). It comprises an array of purine-rich bulges, which resemble the preferred RNA site for Rev binding (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heaphy et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tan et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Battiste et al., 1996</a>). In fact, Region3 assignment is consistent with previous reports showing that positions on Stem I can be protected by Rev oligomers, and truncations in this area affect oligomeric Rev binding (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mann et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Robertson-Anderson et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, Region3 also overlaps with the area on Stem I that could form long-range interactions with the nucleotides 100-113 within Region2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Although Region2 and Region3 are distant from each other based on secondary structure, our observations indicate that tertiary interactions could bring them into close proximity, which might facilitate Rev binding at those regions while forming a continuous oligomer at the same time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>)."

To obtain snapshots of the RNA on a timescale of seconds, a fast-reacting SHAPE reagent, benzoyl cyanide, was used in these experiments (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mortimer and Weeks, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2009</a>). Based on a previous single-molecule study of the Rev-RRE system, the timescale for each Rev binding step is \u223c2\u20135 s (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pond et al., 2009</a>). This indicates that under our experimental conditions, intermediate stages of RNP assembly should be detectable. To increase the precision of the measurements, we adapted the SHAPE-Seq method (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lucks et al., 2011</a>) to determine SHAPE reactivities and rates of SHAPE-monitored structural changes at different positions on the RRE. The accuracy of this method depends on the number of reads used for calculating each SHAPE profile. In this study, the amount of data for one replicate at each time point range from 256,424 to 1,145,824 reads. With this amount of data, the reactivity values (theta, the modification probability [<a href=\"#bib36\">Lucks et al., 2011</a>]) are highly reproducible with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.967 to 0.974 between any two of the three replicates (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

However, more complex SHAPE kinetic patterns are observed for several other nucleotides, most of which show an increase of SHAPE reactivity at earlier time points followed by a gradual decrease (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Next, we calculated the rate for all positions showing a significant SHAPE change (\u0394SHAPE &gt; 0.15) by fitting the time-resolved data using exponential decay/association kinetics. Only the earlier time points for nucleotides with complex kinetic behavior were used for fitting in our initial comparison (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). During Rev-RRE assembly, structural changes of the RRE originate from the primary Rev binding site and subsequently propagate along the RNA. The pattern is similar to that observed based on the thermodynamic experiments described above (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Even though the accuracy of the fastest SHAPE reactivity change rates is limited by the time resolution of the experiment, the overall trend of sequential SHAPE changes is evident (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

At this time resolution, the two Rev binding events that occur in this region, one at Stem IIB and one at the three-way junction at Stem IIA, IIB and IIC, are indistinguishable. And the majority of SHAPE reactivity changes at Region1 occur within 1 s (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). The overall rates of SHAPE reactivity changes at Region2 are only marginally slower than those observed at Region1, and the half-life for the majority of changes in Region1 and Region2 are clustered together below 1.5 s (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Since the RRE RNA at this local region is pre-organized into a compact fold (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), its conformation can facilitate Rev multimerization from Region1 to Region2 with little RNA rearrangement necessary, leading to rapid and highly cooperative binding of multiple Rev proteins. Based on previous reports, binding of the third Rev molecule (the second Rev dimer) and beyond requires higher oligomerization capability of the protein (<a href=\"#bib17\">Daugherty et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, Rev self-association should also be a fast process that can be completed within the same time period."

Combined with data revealing the tertiary fold of the RRE, for the nucleotides with complex kinetic behaviors, the increase in SHAPE reactivities at earlier time points is consistent with rearrangement of the RRE tertiary structure at Region3. This could occur after Rev disrupts the long-range contact within the RRE by binding to Region2; the subsequent decrease in SHAPE reactivity could represent additional Rev binding in this region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The slower rates of structural change in Region3 could be due to RNA conformational changes, or adjustment of Rev conformation as influenced by surrounding RNA and proteins to allow additional Rev oligomerization, or a combination of both effects.

SHAPE reactivity changes at key nucleotides in Region1 and Region2 were compared between different constructs and the 354-nt RRE. For the ease of comparison, the SHAPE reactivity values were normalized so that zero represents the SHAPE state for unbound RRE at 0 s and 1 represents the SHAPE state of the RRE in the fully assembled complex at 900 s. At 6 and 11 s, all RNA constructs behave similarly, and the normalized SHAPE changes indicate that Rev binding at Region1 and Region2 are mostly completed at those time points. In contrast, at 1 s the 354-nt RRE shows overall higher normalized SHAPE changes than all three mutants, indicating that Rev binding rate is enhanced in the context of the full-length RRE with intact Stem I region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). This enhancement is observed at early Rev binding sites, underlining the importance of the RNA tertiary folding. These results reveal that the extended Stem I of the RRE, which covers a cryptic Rev binding site, can enhance the rate of the Rev-RRE complex assembly, likely by pre-organizing the RRE into a favorable conformation for Rev binding. Assembly of this RNP governs the balance for nuclear export of different types of HIV transcripts, which is essential for promoting HIV infectious cycle. Offset in the assembly rate of the Rev-RRE complex could break the optimal balance of cytoplasmic HIV transcripts, which not only affect the distribution of HIV transcripts but could also make a greater difference in the encapsidation of genomic RNA into infectious viral particles (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brandt et al., 2007</a>)."

Our data suggest a concerted Rev-RRE complex assembly mechanism and indicate how specificity can be achieved here with limited components. We propose that Rev-RRE assembly features two distinct stages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The first stage largely utilizes pre-organized RNA structure for protein recruitment, while the second stage involves more global RNA conformational changes and induced-fit RNA-protein recognition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The similarity in the thermodynamic and kinetic RNP assembly pathways indicates that this process is hierarchical, with the RRE RNA driving RNP assembly by organizing sequential Rev binding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The highest affinity Rev-binding site, Stem IIB, ensures that complex assembly nucleates from a single origin on the RNA. Binding of up to four Rev proteins at Region1 and Region2 is tightly coupled to obtain a stable intermediate state (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zemmel et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Van Ryk and Venkatesan, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Daugherty et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pond et al., 2009</a>). This step also releases a cryptic Rev binding site at Region3, which can make further contacts with additional Rev molecules. The tertiary folding of the RRE facilitates the efficiency of Rev-RRE complex formation. In addition, the hierarchical nature of the assembly could ensure its selectivity and accuracy of the final complex with limited number of components. These features together provide a fine control over cytoplasmic distribution of various HIV transcripts as well as viral packaging. Intriguingly, these steps in Rev-RRE assembly resemble those that occur during bacterial ribosome assembly in which stably formed rRNA structures recruit initial ribosomal protein binding partners. The resulting local structures trigger long-range RNA conformational rearrangements that enable binding of additional ribosomal proteins (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adilakshmi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shajani et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). Such similarities suggest that common mechanisms for RNP assembly could be shared among diverse biological processes. Properties of the HIV RNP assembly pathway elucidated here present opportunities for antiviral strategies that could block the nuclear export step of HIV replication by targeting important intermediates of the Rev-RRE complex (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fenster et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chapman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Shuck-Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Ward et al., 2009</a>)."

Region1 and Region2 binding are coupled and the four-Rev complex state can serve as a checkpoint to ensure specificity. Region2 Rev binding leads to conformational change of the RRE to allow additional Rev binding through induced-fit. Both Rev and RRE could sample a number of interaction conformations at the same time until an optimal binding state is reached. The high-oligomer complex is then ready for Crm1 binding and nuclear export."

To make RRE-oligonucleotide complexes, RRE RNA was first annealed at 0.1 mg/ml followed by a 5 min incubation at room temperature. A large excess of oligonucleotides complementary to either nucleotides 54-84 (AS 54-84) or nucleotides 100-113 (AS 100-113) was added to pre-folded RRE and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature to allow the oligonucleotides to form a complex with the RNA.

The data are presented clearly and they are convincing. Their study provides important insight into HIV biology in particular and RNA protein interactions in general.
