Mechanisms whereby T-box3 regulates limb development are poorly understood. We discovered requirements for T-box at multiple stages of mouse limb development and distinct molecular functions in different tissue compartments. Early loss of T-box3 disrupts limb initiation, causing limb defects that phenocopy Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) mutants. Later ablation of T-box3 in posterior limb mesenchyme causes digit loss. In contrast, loss of anterior T-box3 results in preaxial polydactyly, as seen with dysfunction of primary cilia or Gli3-repressor. Remarkably, T-box3 is present in primary cilia where it colocalizes with Gli3. T-box3 interacts with Kif7 and is required for normal stoichiometry and function of a Kif7/Sufu complex that regulates Gli3 stability and processing. Thus, T-box3 controls digit number upstream of Shh-dependent (posterior mesenchyme) and Shh-independent, cilium-based (anterior mesenchyme) Hedgehog pathway function."

Mechanisms whereby T-box3 regulates limb development are poorly understood. We discovered requirements for T-box at multiple stages of mouse limb development and distinct molecular functions in different tissue compartments. Early loss of T-box3 disrupts limb initiation, causing limb defects that phenocopy Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) mutants. Later ablation of T-box3 in posterior limb mesenchyme causes digit loss. In contrast, loss of anterior T-box3 results in preaxial polydactyly, as seen with dysfunction of primary cilia or Gli3-repressor. Remarkably, T-box3 is present in primary cilia where it colocalizes with Gli3. T-box3 interacts with Kif7 and is required for normal stoichiometry and function of a Kif7/Sufu complex that regulates Gli3 stability and processing. Thus, T-box3 controls digit number upstream of Shh-dependent (posterior mesenchyme) and Shh-independent, cilium-based (anterior mesenchyme) Hedgehog pathway function."

Most <i>Tbx3;PrxCre</i> mutants lack digit 5, whose specification and formation depend on 'early phase' Shh signaling beginning at E9.5 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Harfe et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Scherz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Zhu and Mackem, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Zhu et al., 2008</a>). Hand2 protein is required to activate <i>Shh</i> expression in the limb bud (<a href=\"#bib8\">Benazet and Zeller, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Galli et al., 2010</a>). We found that <i>Hand2</i> transcripts are reduced in E9.5 and E10.5 <i>Tbx3;PrxCre</i> mutant forelimb buds (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D,D'</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A, A',F</a>) as is <i>Shh</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,B',F</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Thus, intact <i>Tbx5</i> expression in <i>Tbx3;PrxCre</i> E9.5 forelimbs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>\u2019) indicates that post-initiation, Tbx3 functions downstream of Tbx5 and upstream of <i>Hand2</i>."

In untreated wild type MEFs, our custom C-terminal antibody detected Tbx3 in a subset of cilia (30%, N=56; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B, a1-a5, b1-b5</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>,<a href=\"#SD5-data\">2</a>).

Lysates from control and SAG-treated MEFs showed no detectable difference in Tbx3 protein levels indicating the increased Tbx3 signal in cilia was due to trafficking rather than increased protein levels (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The presence of Tbx3 in cilia and response to Hedgehog pathway activity were also detected with a commercially available anti-Tbx3 antibody with both SAG and Shh stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a> and <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 5</a>,<a href=\"#SD9-data\">6</a>).

Gli3FL stability and partial processing versus complete degradation are regulated by opposing actions of Suppressor of fused (Sufu) and speckle-type POZ protein (Spop), respectively (<a href=\"#bib95\">Wang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Wen et al., 2010</a>). In the absence of Smoothened activation, mammalian Sufu recruits GSK3\u03b2 to phosphorylate Gli3FL downstream of PKA, allowing for its partial processing to Gli3R (which requires Kif7 and intact cilia) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kise et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Tempe et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Wang et al., 2000</a>). Spop is an adaptor for Cullin3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase that drives complete degradation of Gli3FL in the absence of Sufu, but facilitates its processing to Gli3R when Sufu is present (<a href=\"#bib35\">Humke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Wang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>). In contrast to Kif7 and Gli3, we did not detect interactions between Tbx3 and either Sufu or Spop (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The observation that Gli3FL is virtually undetectable in <i>Tbx3;PrxCre</i> anterior mesenchyme (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A'</a>) indicates that despite the increased amount of Sufu (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), it fails to prevent degradation of Gli3FL in the absence of Tbx3."

Limitations in sample quantity made it unfeasible to perform multiple co-IPs on isolated anterior forelimb buds, so we assayed lysates from control and <i>Tbx3<sup>\u0394fl/\u0394fl</sup></i> E10.5 embryos. The altered levels of protein expression seen in mutant limb buds were recapitulated in whole embryos (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As seen in mutant limb buds, the amount of both Gli3FL and Gli3R protein is reduced in <i>Tbx3<sup>\u0394fl/\u0394fl</sup></i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, lanes 1\u20134; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). Notably, the interaction between Gli3 and Sufu is reproducibly decreased in excess of the decrement in Gli3 proteins; this is evident by quantitating and comparing the ratio of Gli3 proteins detected in control versus mutant to that complexed with Sufu. For example, in the representative experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, the Gli3 FL band intensity ratio is ~1.6 fold greater in controls (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, lanes 1 and 3) than in mutants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, lanes 2, 4), while the amount of Gli3FL protein that was immunoprecipitated with Sufu is 4.6 fold greater in controls than mutants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, lane 9 versus 10). Mean band intensity ratios of 3 replicate experiments are shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2019</a>. The decreased Gli3/Sufu interaction in the absence of Tbx3 was also evident when assayed in the opposite direction, that\u00a0is, by IP of Gli3 and immunoblotting for Sufu (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, panel B\u2019 shows relative band intensities for the experiment shown). Sufu/Gli3R interactions were also affected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>\u2019; <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>).

Note that our model and data show a marked decrease in Gli3FL (virtually undetectable by western blot in anterior mesenchyme), but residual Gli3R in mutants. This is consistent with the phenotype of Gli3 deficiency, and digit 1 polysyndactyly is also seen with decreased function of Kif7 or Sufu. Residual Gli3R in the mutants is sufficient to prevent the extreme polydactyly seen in complete absence of Gli3, Kif7 or Sufu. In <i>Tbx3;PrxCre</i> mutant limb buds, Kif7 and Sufu proteins are present at normal and increased levels, respectively, but their interaction with each other, and that of Sufu with Gli3, are decreased. Because Spop facilitates processing of Gli3FL to Gli3R in the presence of Sufu, increased levels of Spop in mutants drives complete degradation of any Gli3FL not converted to Gli3R, resulting in undetectable levels of Gli3FL in anterior mesenchyme. The decreased levels of Gli3R in the anterior likely result from a combination of decreased levels of Gli3FL precursor, inefficient processing due to altered Kif7/Sufu function, and excess Gli3R degradation, as evident by the lower molecular weight species present in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>."

Both the biochemical and subcellular localization experiments would need to be very significantly extended (for example, by using tagged proteins for immunoprecipitation assays), and more thorough controls for these experiments would need to be included. Also the strength and the value of the RNA-seq data presented in the paper were questioned, and these data thus need to be improved.

Most of the conclusions based on whole mount RNA in situs are convincing and new findings. The most novel and surprising finding of the study is that the transcription factor TBX3 is localized to the cilium and interacts with KIF7. HOX proteins have been shown to interact with and inhibit GLI3 in the limb, however cilium localization was not explored. Given that the vast majority of TBX3 protein is in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), it seems surprising to me that the tiny amount in the cilium can be detected with IP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E-H</a>). The interaction with GLI3 could be in the nucleus and/or cilium, but KIF7 should not be in the nucleus. To further bolster the most significant claim of the paper, I think that additional experiments are needed. In particular, the specificity of the antibodies must be proven (e.g. using Tbx2 mutant MEFs for the Tbx3 antibody) and ideally some results confirmed using tagged proteins. Tagged GLI3 is available and other proteins could be easily generated. A genetic test would be to determine whether heterozygosity for Kif7 in mice (or knockdown in cells) rescues the defect proposed to be due to increased KIF7. In addition, many of the claims of changes in gene expression based on the RNA-seq data in Tables 2 and 3 do not seem to be significant differences, and some are opposite to what is said in the Results. Thus, the value of the RNA-seq data, is not clear, especially as only two samples were analyzed for each genotype, although I appreciate it is a difficult experiment. Many of the additional points listed below are simple changes that would make the paper more accessible and data more convincing."

If their hypothesis is correct, one would expect the same might be true for GLI2 since it also binds SuFu and requires cilia for proper processing. Also, if whole embryos reveal the same protein interactions as the anterior limb, why would the posterior limb be different? Gli2/3 double limb mutants could well have a worse posterior limb phenotype than Gli3 null or het mutants. Only a relatively late double conditional mutant of Gli2/3 has been published, and it indicated the posterior phenotype is worse than in single Gli3 mutants. Thus, some of the posterior phenotype in Tbx3 mutants could be due to the altered GLI processing and activity in this tissue, rather than just the decreased Shh expression, especially as Shh heterozygous mutants have normal limbs. Finally, it seems to be an over-interpretation of the data to say that the posterior limb is not dependent on cilia. In cilia mutants\u2019 production of both activators and repressors is altered (diminished), but obvious phenotypes are only seen where the balance is greatly skewed. It would be nice to extend the Discussion of your paper to address these points."

Although the interactions and processing may not occur within the cilia proper; the literature supports that they occur in the cytoplasm or centrosome/basal body adjacent to the cilia (reviewed in Ryan and Chiang 2012; Ingham and McMahon 2009; and Wang et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2010, Humke et al., 2005; Tukachinsky et al., 2010)."

T-box3 interacts with Kif7 and is required for normal stoichiometry and function of a Kif7/Sufu complex that regulates Gli3 stability and processing. Thus T-box3 controls digit number upstream of Shh-dependent (posterior mesenchyme) and Shh-independent, cilium-based (anterior mesenchyme) Hedgehog pathway function.\u201d"
