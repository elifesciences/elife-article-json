In parallel, vM1 also sends information directly to the sensory barrel cortex (vS1). In this study, we investigated the effects of vM1 activation on processing of vibrissae sensory information in vS1 of the rat. To dissociate the vibrissae sensory-motor loop, we optogenetically activated vM1 and independently passively stimulated principal vibrissae. Optogenetic activation of vM1 supra-linearly amplified the response of vS1 neurons to passive vibrissa stimulation in all cortical layers measured. Maximal amplification occurred when onset of vM1 optogenetic activation preceded vibrissa stimulation by 20 ms. In addition to amplification, vM1 activation also sharpened angular tuning of vS1 neurons in all cortical layers measured. Our findings indicated that in addition to output motor signals, vM1 also sends preparatory signals to vS1 that serve to amplify and sharpen the response of neurons in the barrel cortex to incoming sensory input signals."

In parallel, vM1 also sends information directly to the sensory barrel cortex (vS1). In this study, we investigated the effects of vM1 activation on processing of vibrissae sensory information in vS1 of the rat. To dissociate the vibrissae sensory-motor loop, we optogenetically activated vM1 and independently passively stimulated principal vibrissae. Optogenetic activation of vM1 supra-linearly amplified the response of vS1 neurons to passive vibrissa stimulation in all cortical layers measured. Maximal amplification occurred when onset of vM1 optogenetic activation preceded vibrissa stimulation by 20 ms. In addition to amplification, vM1 activation also sharpened angular tuning of vS1 neurons in all cortical layers measured. Our findings indicated that in addition to output motor signals, vM1 also sends preparatory signals to vS1 that serve to amplify and sharpen the response of neurons in the barrel cortex to incoming sensory input signals."

To probe their environment, rodents typically produce whisking movements of their vibrissae, and palpate objects located within the vibrissae reach. The physical contact between external objects and vibrissae generate forces and vibrations at the base of the vibrissae, which are sensed by specialized mechanoreceptors located at the vibrissae pad. In turn, the sensory information collected by these mechanoreceptors is conveyed to the cortex via the VPM and PoM nuclei of the thalamus (<a href=\"#bib47\">Petersen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Diamond et al., 2008</a>). The main cortical region receiving sensory information from the vibrissae is the somatosensory S1 barrel cortex (vS1), which is arranged somatotopically, with each vibrissa represented by a separate and discrete barrel-like region (<a href=\"#bib25\">Izraeli and Porter, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Petersen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Diamond et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bosman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Diamond and Arabzadeh, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Feldmeyer et al., 2013</a>)."

Whisking movements are evoked by descending commands from the primary vibrissae motor cortex (vM1) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grinevich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gerdjikov et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hill et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Petersen, 2014</a>). It is still unclear whether neurons in vM1 directly drive the facial nucleus, or alternatively activate a central pattern generator (CPG) in the brainstem that in turn rhythmically drives the facial nucleus (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grinevich et al., 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib29\">Kleinfeld et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Moore et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib48\">Petersen, 2014</a>). In addition to the descending output motor information to the brain stem, vM1 also directly sends information to other structures in the sensory-motor vibrissae-barrel loop, and especially the vS1 barrel cortex (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aronoff et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Veinante and Desch\u00eanes, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Feldmeyer et al., 2013</a>). This direct vM1 to vS1 pathway originates mostly from layer 2\u20133 and layer 5A pyramidal neurons in vM1 and terminates mostly on layer 5 neurons and to a lesser degree layer 2\u20133 neurons of vS1 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mao et al., 2011</a>). Previous functional studies have shown that vM1 inputs to vS1 carry information regarding both motor parameters of whisking, as well as more complex sensory information (<a href=\"#bib49\">Petreanu et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, inputs from vM1 have been shown to modify the network state of the vS1 barrel cortex, and increase the coding reliability of complex sensory stimuli in vS1 (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zagha et al., 2013</a>)."

A major obstacle we encountered in tackling this question was the fact the vibrissae-barrel system functions as a motor-sensory loop (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kleinfeld et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Diamond et al., 2008</a>), and thus, vM1 can influence vS1 neurons both directly and indirectly. For example, vM1 activation can affect vS1 neuron both via direct inputs connecting the two areas and indirectly via whisking-evoked stimulation of mechanoreceptors in the vibrissae pad. To tackle this problem, we disconnected the motor-sensory loop of the vibrissa-barrel system, and dissociated activation of the motor and sensory components. We passively activated the principal vibrissa by piezo-mediated vibrissa movements or artificial whisking against sandpaper (<a href=\"#bib61\">Szwed et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Garion et al., 2014</a>), and independently activated vM1 with optogenetic stimulation. In all our experiments, we cut the buccolabialis branch of the facial nerve to eliminate cortical-driven whisking movements. Using this experimental paradigm, we aimed to investigate the effect vM1 activation on the response of vS1 neurons to vibrissa stimulation; characterize temporal interactions between vM1 and vS1; and examine the effect of vM1 on angular tuning of vS1 neurons."

Under physiological conditions, the barrel-vibrissae system functions as a loop, and thus vM1 can affect the vS1 barrel cortex both directly and indirectly. To address this obstacle, we passively stimulated the principal vibrissa, and independently activated vM1 neurons using optogenetic stimulation. In the experiments we passively deflected, the principal vibrissa (Typically B2) with piezo-mediated 200 ms ramp and hold vibrissa deflection (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bruno et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lavzin et al., 2012</a>), while concomitantly recording single-unit activity from neurons in the vS1 barrel cortex. We recorded the single-unit activity from neurons in different layers of the vS1 using single-shaft 16 channel silicon probe electrodes (inter contact distance of 50 \u00b5m; contacts located at depth of 300\u20131100 \u00b5m from the pia) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The principal barrel was identified prior to electrode insertion using intrinsic imaging (for details see <a href=\"#bib18\">Garion et al., 2014</a>), and verified by manual deflection of vibrissae during extracellular multi-unit recordings."

Paired opto-stimulation of vM1 supra-linearly amplified the on response vS1 neurons to ramp and hold vibrissa deflection in all cortical layers recorded.

In the previous section, we have shown that paired vM1 activation supra-linearly enhances the response of vS1 barrel cortex neurons to vibrissa stimulation. We next set out to examine whether in addition, paired vM1 activation also effects angular tuning of neurons in the vS1 barrel cortex. In these experiments, we recorded the response of vS1 barrel neurons to passive ramp and hold deflection of the principal vibrissa to eight different directions with and without paired optogenetic activation of vM1. vM1 optogenetic activation was applied at the optimal temporal time window (laser onset preceding vibrissa deflection by 20 ms). In these experiments, we randomly alternated the direction of vibrissa deflection and whether the laser was activated or not. Consistent with previous results, we found that\u00a0angular tuning in neurons is\u00a0located in layers 2\u20133 and layer 4 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bruno et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andermann and Moore, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kremer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lavzin et al., 2012</a>). We further found that layer 5\u00a0neurons in the vS1 barrel cortex also show similar angular tuning. We quantified the percent of neurons with significant angular tuning, and found that 62% \u00b1 8% of all recorded neurons showed significant angular tuning, with no significant differences between putative layers (significant angular tuning was defined by significant difference at the 0.05 level for comparison of the responses to the preferred angle and to the three least preferred angles)."

Sharpening of angular tuning by optogenetic activation of vM1 is demonstrated in six different individual vS1 neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To quantify the effect of vM1 activation on angular tuning of barrel vS1 neurons, we calculated the selectivity index (SI) of angular tuning of the preferred direction (maximal response in the preferred angle/average response to all angles) for each neurons with and without vM1 optogenetic activation. In these experiments, we found that paired vM1 optogenetic activation significantly increased the average SI for angular tuning in vS1 barrel cortex neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), which resulted from a right shift of the SI value histogram by vM1 activation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Interestingly, we observed a significant increase in the SI of the preferred direction in both 50\u201360 day old and 90\u2013100 day old rats (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, as expected, while the SI of the preferred direction increased, the SI values of the worst three angular directions decreased by vM1 activation, although this reduction did not reach statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). It is important to stress that although the SI to the worst directions decreased, in many cases the activation of vM1 increased the absolute response to the worst angles (see examples in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The main findings of this study include: (1) vM1 optogenetic activation supra-linearly amplified the response of vS1 barrel neurons to passive vibrissa stimulation. This supra-linear amplification effect of vM1 activation was observed in all neocortical layers recorded (layers 2\u20135 300\u20131100 \u00b5m from the pia), and recurred in two different passive stimulation paradigms, ramp and hold vibrissa deflection and artificial whisking against sandpaper. (2) The maximal effect of vN1 on the response of vS1 neurons to vibrissa sensory inputs occurred when the onset of vM1 activation preceded vibrissa activation by 20 ms. Smaller yet significant effects were also observed when the onset of vM1 activation preceded vibrissa stimulation by 50 ms or when vibrissa stimulation and vM1 activation occurred simultaneously. This temporal relationship recurred for the two passive stimulation paradigms we examined. The physiological time delay between vM1 and vS1 activation is not fully known. Yet previous studies have shown that the activity of both vM1 and vS1 is phased locked with exploratory rhythmic whisking movements in rats (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahrens and Kleinfeld, 2004</a>), and vM1 neurons are probably critical in rhythmically driving whisking (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvell et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kleinfeld et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ahrens and Kleinfeld, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brecht, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brecht et al., 2004</a>) (3).

First, we show that motor information from vM1 neurons and sensory information from the vibrissae summate supra-linearly in vS1 barrel neurons. Second, we defined the temporal rules governing the interactions between incoming vM1 and vibrissa sensory input information in vS1 neurons. We found maximal vM1-vibrissa interactions occurred when vM1 activation preceded vibrissa stimulation by 20 ms. This optimal temporal window for vM1-vibrissa input interactions suggested that vM1 sent primarily feedforward information regarding the planned vibrissa movements, rather than feedback information originating in the sensory motor loop. Finally, we show that vM1 activation, not only amplified the response of vS1 barrel neurons to incoming vibrissa sensory inputs, but also sharpened their angular tuning curve. Taken together, it seems vM1 inputs participated in increasing both the sensitivity and specificity of barrel cortex neurons to incoming sensory information from the vibrissae. The direct effect of vM1 on vS1 neurons may underlie the difference between passive and active sensing in the barrel vibrissa somatosensory system."

Several different potential cellular and network mechanisms can explain our findings. First, is a non-linear effect on the axonal initiation zone. Specifically with this mechanism, excitatory vM1 inputs depolarize vS1 neurons, and as a result, concomitant vibrissae-evoked EPSPs will generate a larger number of action potentials in the axonal initiation zone. Second, are non-linear dendritic amplification mechanisms. Previous studies have shown that dendrites of neocortical excitatory neurons can support generation of local dendritic sodium, calcium and NMDA spikes (<a href=\"#bib60\">Stuart et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Larkum et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schiller et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Polsky et al., 2004</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">London and H\u00e4usser, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Branco et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lavzin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Xu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Harnett et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Major et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Smith et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Palmer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cichon and Gan, 2015</a>). It is possible that pairing vM1 inputs with inputs carrying vibrissa sensory information results in initiation of local dendritic spikes vS1 neurons. Consistent with this possibility are the results of several previous in\u00a0vivo studies that reported initiation of dendritic spikes in tuft dendrites of vS1 layer-5 pyramidal neurons in response to vM1 and M2 activation (<a href=\"#bib65\">Xu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Manita et al., 2015</a>). Third, are local network mechanisms. For example, vM1 inputs may selectively innervate VIP inhibitory inter neurons, as described for the medial prefrontal inputs to the auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pi et al., 2013</a>). In this case, vM1 inputs will activate VIP inter neurons, which will inhibit other inhibitory inter neurons, and in turn secondary excite pyramidal neurons in vS1."

Typically, vM1, the motor cortex of the barrel vibrissa system, is responsible for generating the whisking movements of the mystacial vibrissae. vM1 can drive whisking either by directly activating lower motor neurons in the facial nucleus, especially during protraction movements, or alternatively, by activating a brain stem CPG located in close proximity to or within the Botzinger complex. In the latter case the CPG drives the facial nucleus to generate rhythmic movements (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grinevich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Haiss and Schwarz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gerdjikov et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Moore et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Petersen, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sreenivasan et al., 2015</a>). In addition to the brainstem output motor commands, vM1 also directly innervates the vS1 barrel cortex. These inputs convey both motor parameters of whisking, as well as more complex sensory information regarding contacting the object and object localization (<a href=\"#bib49\">Petreanu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Harnett et al., 2013</a>)."

                                "text": "Functionally, there are several scenarios for how the vM1 to vS1 pathway participates in sensory computations. First, vM1 inputs can convey a simple \u2018attentional cue\u2019 to prepare vS1 barrel cortex neurons for the incoming sensory information from the vibrissae. Regarding this possibility, it is interesting to note that previous studies have shown that increased attention and especially activation of the frontal eye field area increases the sensitivity and specificity of cortical neurons in sensory visual regions to different visual stimuli (<a href=\"#bib42\">McAdams and Maunsell, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Noudoost et al., 2010</a>). The second possibility is that vM1 inputs convey a motor efference copy that can be used for computing the location as well as shape and texture of objects by comparing the expected (vM1) with the measured (thalamo-cortical) vibrissa movements (<a href=\"#bib16\">Diamond et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kleinfeld and Desch\u00eanes, 2011</a>). Third, multiple inputs converge onto the barrel motor cortex, thus vM1 inputs can serve to convey top-down dynamical modifications of sensory processing in the primary vS1 cortex (<a href=\"#bib65\">Xu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zagha et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Manita et al., 2015</a>), see also <a href=\"#bib58\">Squire et al. (2013)</a> regarding the visual system). Regardless of the exact computational role vM1 inputs play in sensory processing in vS1 neurons, the significant effects vM1 inputs have on vS1 neurons may underlie the importance of active sensing in the somatosensory system. Further studies in awake behaving rodents are needed to distinguish between these three possibilities and decipher the functional role of M1 inputs in sensory processing in somatosensory processing."

P50-60 Wistar rats were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal injection of Urethane (20% dissolved in normal saline). Prior to surgery lidocaine (2%) was applied locally over the scalp, and the buccolabialis branch of the facial nerve, which innervates muscles in the vibrissae pad, was exposed and severed at its proximal segment. The skull was exposed and well cleaned in order to identify important anatomical landmarks such as the midline, bregma and lambda. A craniotomy (2\u20133 mm<sup>2</sup>) was drilled over the vS1 barrel cortex (2.5 mm posterior to bregma, 4.5 mm lateral to the midline), and a well surrounding the craniotomy was constructed using dental cement. In addition, a short metal pole was glued to the skull rostral to the dental cement well and later used to hold the rats head in place. After the dental cement was constructed, the dura matter was carefully removed over a small area (less than 1 mm<sup>2</sup>) to allow access to the cortex. We minimized the area of exposed cortical surface in order to\u00a0reduce brain pulsation and damage during the hours of the recordings. The well surrounding the craniotomy was filled with aCSF to cover the exposed neocortical surface to prevent the brain from drying. Body temperature was carefully maintained at 36\u201337\u00b0C using a heating pad (FHC, Montana, USA)."

A solution (500 nl) containing the ChR2 expressing viral vector (AAV2.1.CAMKIIa-hChR2(H134)-mCherry.WPRE.hGH, UNC viral core facility, North Carolina, USA) was injected into the vM1 region via a small craniotomy. ChR2 expressed in excitatory neurons by using the promotor CaMKII. Viral vby a micromanipulator (Sutter Instruments, California, USA) and connected to glass pipettes with tip diameters of 30\u201350 um. To allow for ChR2 expression in the target pyramidal neurons electrophysiological recordings were performed 4\u20136 weeks after viral vector injections. At the end of each experiment, the location and extent of ChR2 expression were verified histologically. Typically, viral vectors were injected at two depths of 300 and 500 \u00b5m. These injections typically resulted in ChR2 expression in a cortical region with vertical and horizontal extents of 500\u2013600 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

The dental cement well was filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) to prevent drying of the cortical surface during the recording. To activate ChR2 channel, short 473 nm light pulses were generated with a laser (OEM laser pulses, Utah, USA) controlled by an isolated pulse generator (STG4, multichannel system, Germany). The 473 nm laser was connected to a light guide that was held 10\u201320 mm above the neocortical surface. Control experiments revealed that in the absence of ChR2 multiple repeated laser pulses do not affect the activity of neurons in vM1. We repeated the stimulation in each condition (including paired optogenetic stimulation and vibrissa stimulation) 132 times, divided to three equal blocks (44 repetitions), and the blocks were applied in random order."

This is a well studied area and has been the subject of a handful of recent high profile papers. The present study makes an important contribution to this field by breaking the normally recurrent sensory-motor loop so as to be able to study the effect of motor cortex activity in the absence of the indirect effects of the movement that activity would normally produce. To do this, they sever the motor nerve to prevent centrally generated whisking and then stimulate the whiskers passively or by causing artificial whisking by directly stimulating the nerve, while at the same time stimulating the motor cortex ontogenetically. They find that there is a feed-forward facilitation of sensory responses and that this facilitation is strongest for the preferred stimulus, thereby enhancing stimulus specificity. Although there have been other demonstrations of circuits that might produce this facilitation, the sensory and temporal features of the facilitation have not been studied under conditions in which it can be cleanly isolated as here."

To avoid confounding effects by sensory reafference activation they prevented initiation of whisker movements by cutting the motor branch of the facial nerve. For two stimulation paradigms under anesthesia they find that pairing of motor cortex activation with whisker stimulation leads to supralinear spiking responses in barrel cortex neurons across all layers, most prominently in L2/3 and L5. This effect depended on the relative timing of the two inputs, peaking when motor cortex activation shortly preceded the whisker stimulation. In addition, they report a sharpening of tuning to the angular direction of stimulation upon pairing."

Modern tools, especially optogenetic precise control of specific pathways as applied here, now enable addressing this question in vivo. This study therefore is timely and presents highly original data. The finding that neuronal spiking activity in barrel cortex is amplified by activation of the M1-S1 pathway is highly significant, even though the underlying potential mechanisms are not investigated here, as the authors admit. The results regarding changes in angular tuning I find less convincing, given that this feature is a complex, debated issue and little data are provided here. Overall, this is a nice study, making an important contribution to signal processing in the barrel cortex.

Thus, the 'supralinear' effect essentially consists in an upregulation or facilitation of the sensory-evoked response in vS1, which could be simply explained by additional pre-depolarization mediated by the M1-to-S1 projections, given vM1 is stimulated at the right time briefly before the sensory stimulus. While the authors mention this simple explanation (vM1 projection fibers helping vS1 neurons to reach the \u2013 nonlinear \u2013 spike threshold), they only refer to it as 'additional cellular mechanism' in the third paragraph of the subsection \u201cPossible mechanisms underlying vM1 mediated response amplification and sharpening of angular tuning in vS1 barrel neurons\u201d. Their primary 'attractive potential mechanism' of dendritic amplification (in the first paragraph of the aforementioned subsection) in my view is, however, largely speculative.\" The authors should consider toning down their use of 'supralinear responses' and may consider using terms like 'facilitation' or 'modulation.' At the very least they should give more equal weight to the simplest interpretation of these effects."

Our lab has worked and published in the past on the issue (Garion et al., 2014 for ramp and hold stimuli and Lavzin et al., 2012 for angular tuning). In the previous version of the manuscript, we relayed on quoting these articles. However, following the reviewer's comment in the revised manuscript we detailed our procedure for eliminating ringing of the bimorphs (subsection \u201cWhisker stimuli\u201d). Specifically, passive ramp-and-hold stimulation the principle whisker was rapidly deflected (1300\u00b0/second) with a single ceramic piezoelectric bimorph for a period of 200 ms (Simons, 1983; Wilent and Contreras, 2004; Lavzin et al., 2012; Garion et al., 2014). To avoid ringing of the whisker during the rapid deflection phases we used a sigmoid function for the onset and offset piezo movements, resulting in an effective rise/fall duration of 20 ms. The deflections were controlled via a National Instruments board (PCI 6713), using custom routines written in MatLab. To monitor and calibrate whisker movements, and confirm lack of distortion or ringing of the stimulated whisker the deflection was monitored using a laser displacement sensor (LD1605-2; Micro-Epsilon OptoNCDT 1700) (Lotem and Azouz, 2009; Lavzin et al., 2012; Garion et al., 2014). Moreover, we confirmed our calibration, lack of distortions and lack of ringing by whisker tracking with a high-speed camera (1000 fps). For this procedure, whisking movement was photographed with a high-speed camera (Flare, 4M180MCL, 4 Megapixel, Dalsa Xcelera-x4-CL, IO industries at 1000 fps) and software (Streams 6; IO industries) with resolutions 600 \u00d7 350 pixels. Movement of full-length whisker was tracked semi-manually, and the angle and curvature of the whisker were calculated as described in Garion et al., 2014, using a homemade software written in MatLab (MathWorks, NA)."
