Here we show that mouse <i>Sema5A</i> negatively regulates synaptogenesis in early, developmentally-born, hippocampal dentate granule cells (GCs).  Sema5A is strongly expressed by GCs and regulates dendritic spine density in a cell-autonomous manner.  In the adult mouse brain, newly born <i>Sema5A<sup>-/-</sup></i> GCs show an increase in dendritic spine density and increased AMPA-type synaptic responses.  Sema5A signals through PlexinA2 co-expressed by GCs, and the PlexinA2-RasGAP activity is necessary to suppress spinogenesis.  Like <i>Sema5A<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutants, <i>PlexinA2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice show an increase in GC glutamatergic synapses, and we show that <i>Sema5A</i> and <i>PlexinA2</i> genetically interact with respect to GC spine phenotypes.  <i>Sema5A<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice display deficits in social interaction, a hallmark of autism-spectrum-disorders. These experiments identify novel intra-dendritic Sema5A/PlexinA2 interactions that inhibit excitatory synapse formation in developmentally- and adult-born GCs, and they provide support for SEMA5A contributions to autism-spectrum-disorders."
