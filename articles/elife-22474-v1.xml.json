                    "text": "NODAL/Activin signaling orchestrates key processes during embryonic development via SMAD2. How SMAD2 activates programs of gene expression that are modulated over time however, is not known. Here we delineate the sequence of events that occur from SMAD2 binding to transcriptional activation, and the mechanisms underlying them. NODAL/Activin signaling induces dramatic chromatin landscape changes, and a dynamic transcriptional network regulated by SMAD2, acting via multiple mechanisms. Crucially we have discovered two modes of SMAD2 binding. SMAD2 can bind pre-acetylated nucleosome-depleted sites. However, it also binds to unacetylated, closed chromatin, independently of pioneer factors, where it induces nucleosome displacement and histone acetylation. For a subset of genes, this requires SMARCA4. We find that long term modulation of the transcriptional responses requires continued NODAL/Activin signaling. Thus SMAD2 binding does not linearly equate with transcriptional kinetics, and our data suggest that SMAD2 recruits multiple co-factors during sustained signaling to shape the downstream transcriptional program."

How SMAD2 activates programs of gene expression that are modulated over time however, is not known. Here we delineate the sequence of events that occur from SMAD2 binding to transcriptional activation, and the mechanisms underlying them. NODAL/Activin signaling induces dramatic chromatin landscape changes, and a dynamic transcriptional network regulated by SMAD2, acting via multiple mechanisms. Crucially we have discovered two modes of SMAD2 binding. SMAD2 can bind pre-acetylated nucleosome-depleted sites. However, it also binds to unacetylated, closed chromatin, independently of pioneer factors, where it induces nucleosome displacement and histone acetylation. For a subset of genes, this requires SMARCA4. We find that long term modulation of the transcriptional responses requires continued NODAL/Activin signaling. Thus SMAD2 binding does not linearly equate with transcriptional kinetics, and our data suggest that SMAD2 recruits multiple co-factors during sustained signaling to shape the downstream transcriptional program."

Genome-wide interrogation of transcription factor (TF) binding sites and distribution of histone modifications in many different cell types has greatly informed our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying transcription regulation (<a href=\"#bib56\">van Dijk et al., 2014</a>).

It is required at low levels for maintenance of pluripotency in both early embryos and embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and at higher levels for mesendoderm differentiation and left\u2013right patterning (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Schier, 2009</a>). Moreover, in zebrafish embryos, the time of ligand exposure dictates the cell fates specified, with endoderm requiring a longer duration of NODAL signaling than mesoderm (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hagos and Dougan, 2007</a>).

These comprise type I and type II receptors, with NODAL additionally requiring the co-receptor TDGF1 (previously called Cripto) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schier, 2009</a>). Ligand binding leads the type II receptor ACVR2A/ACVR2B to phosphorylate and activate the type I receptor ACVR1B, which in turn recruits and phosphorylates the intracellular transducers, SMAD2 and SMAD3 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wu and\u00a0Hill, 2009</a>). Once phosphorylated, SMAD2/3 form complexes with SMAD4 and accumulate in the nucleus, where they directly regulate transcription (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ross and Hill, 2008</a>). SMAD3 and SMAD4 contact DNA through their N-terminal Mad homology 1 (MH1) domain, recognizing the sequence AGAC/GTCT (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zawel et al., 1998</a>). SMAD2, in contrast, cannot bind DNA directly (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yagi et al., 1999</a>) and requires interaction with additional TFs to recruit it to DNA (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gaarenstroom and Hill, 2014</a>). The Forkhead TF FOXH1 was the first such cooperating TF to be identified, and is essential for the induction of a subset of NODAL/Activin target genes during gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Attisano et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 1996</a>). Other SMAD2-recruiting TFs include MIXER, POU5F1/OCT4, NANOG, EOMES and TEAD proteins, which have distinct DNA binding specificities compared with FOXH1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Beyer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brown et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Faial et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Germain et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kunwar et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mullen et al., 2011</a>). It remains unclear how activated SMAD complexes find their binding sites on DNA, in particular, whether the recruiting TFs are pre-bound or whether they bind simultaneously with the SMADs. One study proposed that SMAD complexes can only bind to sites already occupied by Master TFs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mullen et al., 2011</a>). However, this model ascribes a purely modulatory role for TGF-\u03b2 superfamily pathways, which is at odds with the clear driving role of NODAL/Activin signaling in early development (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schier, 2009</a>)."

Consistent with this idea the SMADs are known to recruit a number of chromatin modifiers and remodelers including the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) EP300 (previously called p300), the ATP-dependent helicase SMARCA4 (previously called BRG1), the H3K27 demethylase JMJD3 and Mediator components (<a href=\"#bib17\">Feng et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Xi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ross et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dahle et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kato et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2011</a>).

However, what dictates the target gene specificity of these collaborating factors has not been determined, nor is it known whether they precede or follow SMAD2 binding to DNA.

Most significantly, in contrast to ESCs, they do not differentiate when treated with the NODAL/Activin type I receptor inhibitor, SB-431542 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vallier et al., 2005</a>), making them ideal for analyzing transcription from a signal-inhibited baseline. We have performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for SMAD2, two different phosphorylation states of Pol II and various histone modifications in signal-inhibited cells and upon acute and chronic NODAL/Activin signaling. We identify a dynamic transcriptional program downstream of NODAL/Activin signaling which requires a continuous signaling input for its implementation. We go on to define the sequence of events that occur from SMAD2 binding to transcriptional activation, and the mechanisms underlying them.

We focused on SMAD2 phosphorylation (pSMAD2) as SMAD2 is the predominant receptor-regulated SMAD downstream of NODAL/Activin in these cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Robust induction of pSMAD2 was detected within 30\u201360 min, which attenuated to lower levels at later time points (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Both pSMAD2 induction and target gene expression were partly dependent on Activin dose (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). P19s exhibit chronic signaling in the untreated state which results from autocrine ligand production. This is characterized by low levels of pSMAD2 and intermediate levels of target gene expression, and is also evident upon SB-431542 washout (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lane 1; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>, see lanes marked \u2018media\u2019). The ligands responsible are NODAL and GDF3, which signal via ACVR1B, ACVR2A/B and TDGF1 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schier, 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>).

To address this on a genome-wide scale we performed RNA-seq in four different conditions: SB-431542-treated cells; 1 hr Activin-treated; 8 hr Activin-treated and untreated (chronic signaling). We identified 747 genes significantly differentially expressed at at least one timepoint relative to the SB-431542-treated state (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Expression changes for a subset of genes following Activin treatment were validated by qPCR (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Even in the \u2018induced sustained\u2019 category where transcript levels were higher after 8 hr of Activin signaling compared with 1 hr, the rate of accumulation of transcripts decreased after 1 hr of Activin stimulation. Consistent with the modulation of gene expression profiles over time, we found that transcription of a substantial proportion of the delayed and repressed genes was perturbed by the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). A subset of delayed target genes was no longer induced, and many repressed genes, either those inhibited by Activin signaling, or those whose transcription declined following a transient induction, were no longer repressed.

Taking representative examples of target genes in each of the four categories, we found that inhibiting signaling after 1 hr of Activin stimulation with SB-431542 had a dramatic effect on the subsequent transcriptional profile of the target genes. Induced sustained genes require continuous SMAD2 signaling for their long-term transcription, and delayed genes require extended signaling to be induced at all (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B and C</a>). For transiently induced genes like <i>Smad7</i> and <i>Hes1</i> we found that when signaling was terminated after 1 hr their levels fell rapidly to baseline, presumably because of the very short half-life of these mRNAs, whereas in the context of continuous signaling, these genes were repressed in a more gradual fashion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Transcriptional repression of genes like <i>Fgfr2</i> also required on-going signaling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

For the latter, we performed ChIP-seq for the largest subunit of Pol II specifically phosphorylated on Ser5 or Ser2 of its C-terminal domain (CTD) to differentiate between initiating and elongating forms of Pol II respectively (<a href=\"#bib33\">Levine, 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). By identifying regions of enriched Pol II over gene bodies in stimulated states relative to the SB-431542 state, we defined genes regulated by the pathway. The SMAD2 peaks were associated with the closest regulated gene using a cut-off of 100 kb from an annotated TSS or transcription termination site (TTS). In this way we identified 140 NODAL/Activin transcriptional targets, associated with 478 SMAD2 peaks for further analysis (high confidence dataset; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). A metaprofile of normalized readcounts associated with these peaks is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>. We found that approximately 50% of these SMAD2 peaks were detected within a 10 kb window around the TSS of the regulated gene (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The 140 regulated genes were classified into the four different gene expression categories defined above, and we additionally noted that 29 of the induced genes were activated from an undetectable baseline in the SB-431542 state (\u2018baseline off\u2019 \u2013 see further below) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>)."

Rapid signal-induced transcription is often characterized by a pause\u2013release mechanism for Pol II activation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Levine, 2011</a>). In this scenario, activated Pol II phosphorylated on Ser5 within its CTD is enriched on target genes just downstream of the TSS, associated with pausing factors. Upon active signaling, TF binding induces dissociation of the pausing factors and recruits proteins that positively regulate Pol II elongation, characterized by Ser2 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman and Lis, 2012</a>)."

We noted that the relative changes in Pol II Ser5P and Pol II Ser2P for the differentially-regulated target genes followed similar patterns (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), and the Ser2P and Ser5P values correlated well (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These observations suggested that Pol II recruitment is the dominant mechanism for transcriptional activation in response to Activin, because for a pause\u2013release mechanism we would expect Pol II Ser5P and Pol II Ser2P to be differentially enriched (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sawicka et al., 2014</a>). We addressed this directly using metaprofiles to examine the relative enrichment of Pol II Ser5P and Pol II Ser2P around the TSSs of target genes subdivided with respect to their kinetic expression pattern. Most importantly there was no paused Pol II Ser5P at the TSS in the SB-431542-treated state for the genes with a silent baseline (\u2018baseline off\u2019) nor any enrichment of Pol II Ser2P in these conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). For the \u2018baseline on\u2019 genes, where a peak of Pol II Ser5P <i>was</i> seen at the TSS in the SB-431542-treated state, this was accompanied by enrichment of Pol II Ser2P throughout the body of the gene and a peak at the TTS, indicating on-going transcription of these genes as expected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Moreover, the shape of the profiles did not change with ligand induction; the amplitude simply increased, which reflects changes in Pol II recruitment. For the other categories, the enrichment of Pol II Ser5P generally followed the gene expression dynamics (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

This is a crucial question in the light of the results above showing that modulation of the transcriptional profiles over time requires on-going Activin signaling. To quantitate SMAD2 binding for each gene we defined a SMAD2 footprint that incorporates both peak intensity and peak number associated with the regulated gene. We compared how the SMAD2 footprint changed over time relative to transcription as measured by RNA-seq and Pol II occupancy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). Although the majority of directly induced genes (induced sustained or transient induced) showed highest Pol II occupancy after 1 hr Activin signaling, mirroring pSMAD2 activation, SMAD2 binding did not correlate with the transcriptional kinetics (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In many cases SMAD2 chromatin occupancy increased around genes after prolonged signal exposure when Pol II occupancy was downregulated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> \u2013 see the transient induced and repressed gene categories). Two very clear examples of this phenomenon are <i>Smad7</i> and <i>Tbx3</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This strongly suggests that secondary repression of transcription in response to Activin is not a result of loss of SMAD2 binding, but rather subsequent recruitment of repressors by chromatin-bound SMAD2."

However, it is not known to what extent the SMADs directly induce changes in the chromatin landscape at target binding sites, and if they do, with what dynamics these occur. To answer this question we performed ChIP-seq for histone modifications in the same conditions used for the Pol II and SMAD2 ChIP-seq analyses. We analysed opposing activating and repressive histone modifications, namely H3K9Ac and H3K9Me3, as well as H3K27Ac and H3K27Me3 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Calo and Wysocka, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zentner and Scacheri, 2012</a>).

These effects were even more pronounced if we focused only on those sites which showed the highest induction of histone acetylation (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> for definition of these peaks). This revealed a greater than two fold decrease in H3 occupancy at SBSs with ligand stimulation and an induction of histone acetylation from a flat baseline (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, right-hand panels).

To this end we quantified H3K27Ac and H3K9Ac read depth in 5 kb windows surrounding all loci in the high confidence dataset with a SMAD2 peak in at least one signaling condition. Histone acetylation is highly variable in the SB-431542 state and also changes over time at many SBSs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We found that overall SMAD2 binding is stronger around those loci defined by high H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Moreover, the acetylation status in the SB-431542-treated state predicted SMAD2 binding for the 1 hr peaks, but not for the 8 hr peaks (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Because a subset of SMAD2 binding events occur at non-acetylated chromatin (see above), we also investigated whether higher induction of acetylation at these sites following signal activation was associated with higher enrichment of SMAD2. Indeed, SMAD2 normalized read depth was significantly higher at regions where histone acetylation is induced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

Since FOXH1 is a member of the forkhead transcription factor family which frequently act as pioneer factors (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</a>), we hypothesized that FOXH1 may act as such to recruit SMAD2 to sites of closed unacetylated chromatin. We raised an antibody against mouse FOXH1 (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and performed ChIP-PCR on a subset of SBSs. We found no binding of FOXH1 at all at any SBS in the SB-431542-treated cells, but binding was rapidly and strongly inducible upon Activin stimulation at the SBSs for <i>Lefty1</i>, <i>Lefty2</i>, and <i>Pitx2</i>, which are genes whose transcription is FOXH1-dependent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). There was little or no inducible binding at the SBSs flanking <i>Pmepa1</i> and <i>Pou5f1,</i> as expected, since expression of these genes does not require FOXH1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). The same results were obtained using a P19 cell line that stably expresses near-endogenous levels of MYC-tagged FOXH1 and performing ChIP-PCR with an anti-MYC antibody (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>). Thus for genes that are regulated by FOXH1, it is recruited to DNA together with SMAD2 upon Activin stimulation, and does not act as a classic pioneer factor."

                                "text": "Having demonstrated that activated SMAD2 binds to closed chromatin and that it induces nucleosome eviction, we dissected the underlying mechanism. Previous work has shown that SMARCA4, the ATP-dependent helicase component of the SWI-SNF nucleosome remodeling complex (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lange et al., 2011</a>), is required for TGF-\u03b2-induced transcription of many, though not all, target genes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ross et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Xi et al., 2008</a>). At what level it functions has not been clear. As SMARCA4 is known to interact with activated SMAD2 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ross et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Xi et al., 2008</a>), we hypothesized that it was a good candidate for promoting chromatin remodeling and/or nucleosome eviction at SMAD2 binding sites. To address this possibility we first tested the effect of SMARCA4 knockdown on transcription of a selection of Activin target genes. Activin-induced transcription of three \u2018baseline off\u2019 genes, <i>Lefty1</i>, <i>Lefty2</i> and <i>Pmepa1,</i> was inhibited by depletion of SMARCA4, whilst the Activin-induced transcription of two \u2018baseline on\u2019 genes, <i>Smad7</i> and <i>Pitx2</i> was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The effect of SMARCA4 depletion on SMAD2 chromatin binding correlated well with the transcription assays. Recruitment of SMAD2 to the SBSs flanking <i>Lefty1, Lefty2</i> and <i>Pmepa1</i> required SMARCA4, but SMAD2 recruitment to those regulating <i>Pitx2</i> and <i>Smad7</i> was not substantially affected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Consistent with the idea that SMAD2 binding leads to flanking histone acetylation and nucleosome eviction, we found that Activin-induced H3K27 acetylation and increased chromatin accessibility at the SBSs flanking <i>Lefty1</i>, <i>Lefty2</i> and <i>Pmepa1</i> were also dependent on SMARCA4 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, Activin-induced acetylation and accessibility of the <i>Smad7</i> and <i>Pitx2</i> SBSs was markedly less dependent on SMARCA4 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

For a subset of genes SMAD2 binds in response to acute Activin signaling to transcriptionally silent chromatin. These sites appear to be marked by H3K4Me1 and SMAD2 binds them without the requirement for a pioneer factor. In fact we show that SMAD2 and the co-activator FOXH1 both bind inducibly upon Activin signaling. SMAD2 binding induces nucleosome displacement and histone H3 acetylation at multiple sites at adjacent nucleosomes. The acetylation is likely induced by EP300 as we demonstrate that this HAT is recruited to chromatin with the same kinetics as SMAD2. Moreover, SMAD2 recruitment, histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility requires SMARCA4. At other targets, which have a detectable level of basal transcription, SMAD2 binds to pre-existing nucleosome-depleted sites that are already flanked by acetylated H3-containing nucleosomes. H3 acetylation is further increased upon SMAD2 binding at these sites. Following SMAD2 binding and induction of local histone acetylation, transcription is initiated by inducing Pol II recruitment, rather than via a pause\u2013release mechanism commonly associated with signal-induced transcription. Pol II recruitment correlates with further histone acetylation both at the TSS and in the body of the regulated gene. Finally, we have established that the long-term dynamic transcriptional profiles downstream of NODAL/Activin require a continuous signaling input. This is evident at the level of chromatin since we find that SMAD2 remains bound at enhancers at prolonged times after Activin induction even though target gene transcription is frequently attenuated or completely terminated. Thus SMAD2 binding does not correlate directly with transcription of target genes, and our results strongly suggest that chromatin-bound SMAD2 sequentially recruits multiple co-factors that modulate the transcriptional output during prolonged signaling."

We have not yet provided direct evidence for this secondary repression mechanism, but possible candidates for such repressors are TGIF, SKI, SKIL, ZEB1/2 or EVI-1 that can associate with activated SMAD2/3 to repress transcription (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deheuninck and Luo, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kurokawa et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Postigo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tsuneyoshi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wotton et al., 1999</a>).

This subsequently leads to Pol II recruitment and acetylation at the TSS of the target gene with kinetics following the expression pattern of the transcript. The ability of activated SMAD2 to bind inactive chromatin and remodel it was unexpected, as it was previously suggested that SMAD2/3 only binds sites already occupied by master TFs, and that NODAL/Activin signaling does not affect nucleosome positioning at POU5F1-shared binding sites in ESCs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mullen et al., 2011</a>).

We have demonstrated that EP300 is enriched together with SMAD2 at enhancer loci, and intriguingly, we previously showed that EP300 recruited to a chromatin template in vitro by DNA-tethered SMAD2 preferentially acetylates H3 over H4 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ross et al., 2006</a>). Overall we have observed that in response to acute Activin signaling, H3K9Ac and H3K27Ac are induced similarly. Although H3K27Ac is predominantly catalyzed by EP300 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Calo and Wysocka, 2013</a>), H3K9Ac is thought to be catalyzed by GCN5/PCAF or TIP60 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Karmodiya et al., 2012</a>).

For a selection of latent enhancers (for example <i>Lefty1, Lefty2,</i> and <i>Pitx2</i>) FOXH1 recruits the active SMAD2-containing complex. FOXH1 is a member of the Forkhead family of TFs and one of the best characterized SMAD2 binding partners (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Randall et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Silvestri et al., 2008</a>). We had hypothesized that FOXH1 would act as a pioneer factor. However, we found that FOXH1\u2013SMAD2 complexes bind their target sites only in response to signaling, implying that they bind cooperatively. This mode of binding and the requirement for chromatin remodeling complexes suggests that SMAD2 may bind chromatin through what has recently been termed the dynamic assisted loading mechanism (<a href=\"#bib53\">Swinstead et al., 2016</a>). At the latent enhancers, FOXH1 is required for Activin-induced SMAD2 recruitment, and hence for ligand-induced nucleosome displacement and histone acetylation. Importantly, FOXH1 is not the only SMAD2-recruiting TF that can bind to latent enhancers. Activin-induced accessibility of the upstream enhancer of the <i>Pmepa1</i> gene does not require FOXH1 and must be dependent on an as yet unidentified TF."

POU5F1 itself is a good candidate for creating a favorable environment at these enhancers for SMAD2 to bind and potentiate transcription.

Our newly established paradigms highlight that there is no single generic mechanism of SMAD2-mediated transcription, but rather it is gene specific and can occur in an acute or delayed fashion and can be activatory or repressive. The initial transcriptional profile is modulated at later time points as a result of both delayed SMAD2 binding, and subsequent binding of repressors to already occupied SBSs. Future work will aim to identify TFs and enzymes that collaborate with the SMADS to modulate the transcriptional response over time, allowing cells to correctly execute gene expression programs in response to TGF-\u03b2 superfamily signaling."

We accounted for differences in total read counts observed between the different samples using the normalization strategy found in the DESeq package from Bioconductor (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anders and Huber, 2010</a>). This approach is equivalent to scaling to the total number of reads, however it is biased towards non-differential genes.

Using total mapped reads has been shown to be unreliable, since variations in enrichment efficiency can have dramatic effects on the proportion of reads attributed to signal. A more appropriate normalization strategy is to use only reads derived from regions with high signal and low variance across all samples. Therefore, we used DiffReps 1.55.4 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Shen et al., 2013</a>) to calculate sample-specific normalization factors for the Pol II (either phosphorylated on Ser2 or Ser5 of the CTD), H3K27Ac and H3K9Ac ChIP-seq datasets. Furthermore, to be able to compare the signal for the same protein or modification from different treatments, the DiffReps normalization factors generated per time point were adjusted so that the geometric mean of the SB-431542 samples was constant across all comparisons from the same IP."

The corresponding input samples were also processed with DiffReps for background noise estimation. The \u2018--nsd\u2019 and \u2018--frag\u2019 parameters were set to \u2018broad\u2019 and \u2018200\u2019, respectively, and all other parameters were kept as default. Sites of differential binding for Pol II Ser2P and Ser5P from all the comparisons were overlapped with respect to knownGene gene loci from the UCSC with the allowance for 2 kb of flanking sequence. More specifically, for each comparison, the sum of all differential bases found to overlap a given gene was calculated, and this was reported as a ratio of the length of the gene interval. Through inspection of the dataset it was found that genes exhibiting an overlap ratio\u00a0\u22650.09 in any one of the comparisons were the most reliable. This gene list was then manually filtered to remove microRNAs and false positives, giving a dataset of 410 genes. This dataset represents the annotated genes which clearly show differential Pol II occupancy in response to signaling."

This is argued to be incompatible with a model of SMAD2 recruitment to pioneer transcription factors (PMID: 22036565 & PMID: 22036566), but for this function, pre-binding is not essential. Indeed, it has been previously reported that FOXH1 is recruited to chromatin following activin signaling (PMID: 21741376). Moreover, a mechanism for activin-stimulated recruitment of FoxH1 to closed chromatin has been reported to be mediated by TIF1g-Smad2/3 (PMID: 22196728).

A lot of data is generated and presented in this paper and from this the authors attempt to make several conclusions. However, overall, despite the large amount of work, the study lacks fundamentally new findings on how Smad transcription factors work. For example, the authors claim that Smad2 works through affecting polymerase recruitment and not pause release but the data are not entirely consistent with this view (see below). The authors also indicate that Smad binding kinetics do not necessarily correlate with gene expression profiles (and hence use different mechanisms at different genes). However, the authors do not take into account message stability, which is potentially reshaping the target gene expression profiles rather than a transcriptional effect per se. Another important issue is the inclusion of \"media only\" effects in timecourses of activin signalling and this is not really appropriate (see below) and impacts on the interpretation of the gene expression profiles. Two of the latter findings (i.e. involvement of FOXH1 and SMARCCA4) are interesting but are already well known and studied Smad effector proteins. Overall, the current paper is therefore not conclusive enough for publication, in part through the inclusion of too much information that is not always necessary. However, with streamlining and careful re-interpretation of the data, a more coherent story might emerge."

This is not the same as treating with activin for 48 hrs and is actually a different question being asked i.e. what is the difference between acute activin signalling responses and endogenously generated sustained signalling. This of course impacts greatly on the profiles in part C, where the last time point should be deleted. The \"sustained\" signal is not actually central to the story and could easily be deleted from the paper. Indeed, many of the later figures do not use this condition anyway."

If looking at the same peak, then this is not stringent enough as the summits could be up to 500 bp apart and a parameter like summit-summit distance or% peak overlap should be used instead. If attempting to just associated total Smad binding with a gene, then the peak overlaps are not relevant. What happens if alternative ways of merging the Smad signal are used?"

However, in the \"baseline on\" set, there is clear evidence of paused polymerase in the inhibited condition i.e. at the TSS. In contrast this is not the case in the \"baseline off\" samples. In the latter case, then \"recruitment\" must be the primary mechanism and in the former case, pause-release must be the initial event. After the initial events it is highly likely that both mechanisms are important in both cases (i.e. the polymerase must be recruited and move to the elongation phase at both types of site once the first polymerase has moved off). It is also apparent in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> that both Ser2 and Ser5 forms of the polymerase increase which again suggests both mechanisms are generally activated. Have the authors looked at total RNA polymerase levels by ChIP rather than the CTD marks which inevitably pick out the promoter-proximal and elongating polymerases."

Interestingly these genes show a lot of evidence for paused polymerase at the TSS. Perhaps more importantly, looking back on <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, all of the genes show increased activation at the 1 hr time point. This suggests a unifying mechanism of Smad action through upregulating the initial transcription levels. The authors invoke a mechanism of Smads recruiting additional co-repressors to then shape subsequent responses and there is no evidence presented to support this claim (and evidence should be provided for this claim to be made)."

Even in the \"baseline off samples\" (&lt;30 regions), then the chromatin is still open at the Smad binding regions. Therefore, it appears that there is a window of accessibility already present to which Smad2 binds, and subsequently widens. Thus, the idea that Smad2 is binding differently is not really supported by the data but is in fact accessing a \"nucleosome depleted\" DNA region in all cases."

For example, the authors claim that Smad2 works through affecting polymerase recruitment and not pause release but the data are not entirely consistent with this view (see below). The authors also indicate that Smad binding kinetics do not necessarily correlate with gene expression profiles (and hence use different mechanisms at different genes). However, the authors do not take into account message stability which is potentially reshaping the target gene expression profiles rather than a transcriptional effect per se. Another important issue is the inclusion of \"media only\" effects in timecourses of activin signalling and this is not really appropriate (see below) and impacts on the interpretation of the gene expression profiles. Two of the latter findings (i.e. involvement of FOXH1 and SMARCCA4) are interesting but are already well known and studied Smad effector proteins.
