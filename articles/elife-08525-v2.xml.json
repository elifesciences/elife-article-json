Mtb lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cells have been detected in Mtb-infected individuals. However, their role in protective immunity against Mtb remains unclear due to the absence of group 1 CD1 expression in mice. To overcome the challenge, we generated mice that expressed human group 1 CD1 molecules (hCD1Tg) and a CD1b-restricted, mycolic-acid specific TCR (DN1Tg). Using DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice, we found that activation of DN1 T cells was initiated in the mediastinal lymph nodes and showed faster kinetics compared to Mtb Ag85B-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after aerosol infection with Mtb. Additionally, activated DN1 T cells exhibited polyfunctional characteristics, accumulated in lung granulomas, and protected against Mtb infection. Therefore, our findings highlight the vaccination potential of targeting group 1 CD1-restricted lipid-specific T cells against Mtb infection."

Mtb lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cells have been detected in Mtb-infected individuals. However, their role in protective immunity against Mtb remains unclear due to the absence of group 1 CD1 expression in mice. To overcome the challenge, we generated mice that expressed human group 1 CD1 molecules (hCD1Tg) and a CD1b-restricted, mycolic-acid specific TCR (DN1Tg). Using DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice, we found that activation of DN1 T cells was initiated in the mediastinal lymph nodes and showed faster kinetics compared to Mtb Ag85B-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after aerosol infection with Mtb. Additionally, activated DN1 T cells exhibited polyfunctional characteristics, accumulated in lung granulomas, and protected against Mtb infection. Therefore, our findings highlight the vaccination potential of targeting group 1 CD1-restricted lipid-specific T cells against Mtb infection."

Two major groups of CD1 isoforms have been identified in humans: group 1 CD1 (CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c) and group 2 CD1 (CD1d) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Adams, 2014</a>). While CD1d is broadly expressed, group 1 CD1 expression is limited to cortical thymocytes and professional antigen presenting cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barral and Brenner, 2007</a>). Humans express all CD1 isoforms while mice only express CD1d. Due to the lack of a suitable small animal model to study group 1 CD1-restricted T cells, CD1d-restricted NKT cells have been better studied. A large proportion of CD1d-restricted NKT cells express an invariant TCR \u03b1 chain and are known as iNKT cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bendelac et al., 2007</a>). Unlike conventional T cells, which are positively selected by thymic epithelial cells (TECs), hematopoietic cells (HCs) select iNKT cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bendelac et al., 2007</a>). The unique developmental selection program is thought to drive their pre-activated phenotype, which allows for rapid effector function manifestations upon TCR stimulation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bendelac et al., 2007</a>)."

Group 1 CD1-restricted T cell responses have mostly been characterized in the context of mycobacterial antigens, although recent studies have shown that humans have a significant proportion of autoreactive group 1 CD1-restricted T cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">de Jong et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">de Lalla et al., 2011</a>). The Mtb cell wall is lipid rich (60% of its cell wall is composed of lipids) and contains a plethora of lipid antigens that are presented by group 1 CD1 molecules (<a href=\"#bib46\">Van Rhijn et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">De Libero and Mori, 2014</a>). Among group 1 CD1 molecules, CD1b presents the largest pool of Mtb-derived lipids like mycolic acid (MA), glucose monomycolate, glycerol monomycolate, diacylated sulfoglycolipids, lipoarabinomannan and phosphatidylinositol mannoside to cognate T cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Van Rhijn et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">De Libero and Mori, 2014</a>).

Additionally, due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant Mtb and the lack of an effective vaccine to prevent pulmonary TB in adults, it is important to decipher the role of various T cell subsets in Mtb infection for the development of better preventive or therapeutic vaccines (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ottenhoff et al., 2012</a>). The subunit vaccines currently under development for Mtb utilize peptide or protein antigens which target MHC-restricted conventional T cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dorhoi and Kaufmann, 2014</a>), but the utility in targeting lipid antigens has not been explored. Since CD1 molecules are non-polymorphic, CD1-restricted Mtb lipid antigens are likely to be recognized by most individuals, making them attractive vaccine targets (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barral and Brenner, 2007</a>). Several lines of evidence suggest that Mtb lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cells contribute to anti-mycobacterial immunity. Investigation of group 1 CD1-restricted T cell lines derived from healthy or mycobacteria-infected individuals has revealed that these T cells are cytotoxic and produce IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, cytokines critical for protective immunity to TB (<a href=\"#bib46\">Van Rhijn et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, group 1 CD1-restricted Mtb lipid-specific T cells are found in higher frequencies in individuals exposed to Mtb compared with control populations, suggesting that they are activated following infection with Mtb (<a href=\"#bib35\">Moody, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ulrichs et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gilleron, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Layre et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Moody et al., 2000</a>).

Using this model, we demonstrated the feasibility to study group 1 CD1-restricted T cell responses in aerosol infection with Mtb (<a href=\"#bib22\">Felio et al., 2009</a>). To facilitate the direct analysis of Mtb lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cells, we generated a novel transgenic mouse strain that expressed a human/mouse chimeric TCR, composed of variable region from human T cell clone DN1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Grant et al., 1999</a>), specific for CD1b/mycolic acid (MA), and mouse TCR constant region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). DN1Tg founders and their progeny were screened for the presence of <i>TRAV13-2-TRAJ57</i> gene fragment by PCR and for the surface expression of human V\u03b25.1 (TRBV5-1) by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Subsequently, DN1Tg mice were bred onto hCD1Tg/Rag<sup>-/-</sup> background to eliminate the expression of endogenous TCR. All DN1Tg mice used in this study were on a Rag<sup>-/-</sup> background. To examine whether the development of DN1\u2009T cells was dependent on group 1 CD1 molecules, we compared DN1\u2009T cells in WT and hCD1Tg backgrounds. We found that both frequency and absolute number of DN1\u2009T cells were greatly reduced in DN1Tg mice compared with DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice in all tested organs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). This suggested that group 1 CD1 supported the development of DN1\u2009T cells. Notably, unlike CD1d-restricted iNKT cells, DN1\u2009T cells from the spleen and lymph nodes of DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice exhibited a na\u00efve phenotype (characterized by low expression levels of T cell activation markers such as CD69 and CD44) similar to conventional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and were either CD8\u03b1\u03b2<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> (DN).

Several studies have demonstrated the correlation between positive selection on HCs and a pre-activated T cell phenotype of innate-like T cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bendelac et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cho et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bediako et al., 2012</a>). Given that DN1\u2009T cells exhibited a na\u00efve surface phenotype, one would expect DN1\u2009T cells to be positively selected by TECs. To test this hypothesis, we adoptively transferred bone marrow from DN1Tg and DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice (in the Rag-deficient background) into irradiated CD45.1 congenic WT and hCD1Tg recipients. 5 weeks after transfer, DN1\u2009T cells were identified by CD45.2and hV\u03b25.1 surface expression in different groups (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The percentage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and absolute number (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) of DN1\u2009T cells were significantly higher in mice with group 1 CD1-expressing HCs compared to mice that only had group 1 CD1-expressing TECs. This suggested that HCs most efficiently mediate the positive selection of DN1\u2009T cells. As a small number of DN1\u2009T cells developed in mice that lack CD1b (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), it is possible that mouse CD1d is responsible for their selection. We compared the percentage of DN1\u2009T cells in the spleen and thymus of DN1Tg/hCD1Tg (CD1d<sup>+</sup>), DN1Tg/hCD1Tg/CD1d<sup>-/-</sup>, DN1Tg (CD1d<sup>+</sup>), and DN1Tg/CD1d<sup>-/-</sup> mice (all in the Rag-deficient background). We found that the percentage of DN1\u2009T cells was comparable in DN1Tg/hCD1Tg and DN1Tg/hCD1Tg/CD1d<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In addition, DN1\u2009T cells were barely detectable in the thymus and spleen of DN1Tg and DN1Tg/CD1d<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These data suggest that CD1d does not contribute to the thymic selection of DN1\u2009T cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Since DN1\u2009T cells could also be selected by TECs, albeit with much lower efficiency compared to HCs, we compared the phenotype of DN1\u2009T cells that developed in mice expressing CD1b on both HC and TEC, HC only and TEC only.

To test whether DN1\u2009T cells that developed in DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice retained the same functional properties as the original human T cell line, we stimulated lymph node cells from DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice with un-pulsed or MA-pulsed bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to detect IFN-\u03b3 production and antigen-specific cytotoxicity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). DN1\u2009T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 in response to MA-pulsed hCD1Tg DCs but not WT DCs or un-pulsed DC, suggesting the activation of DN1\u2009T cells required both antigen and group 1 CD1 molecules. In addition, DN1\u2009T cells showed cytotoxic activity against MA-pulsed hCD1Tg DCs. MA is located within the Mtb cell wall, either covalently attached via arabinogalactan to the cell wall peptidoglycan, or non-covalently associated in the form of trehalose dimycolate (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barry et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Karakousis et al., 2004</a>). To determine whether DN1\u2009T cells can be activated by naturally processed MA, we set up co-culture of DN1\u2009T cells with Mtb-infected BMDCs. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, co-culture of DN1\u2009T cells with Mtb-infected hCD1Tg DCs led to up-regulation of activation markers CD69 and CD44 on DN1\u2009T cells. Furthermore, DN1\u2009T cells produced multiple cytokines, of which the production of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-13 and IL-6 was dependent on the presence of group 1 CD1 molecules (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), with the exception of IL-17. It is possible that co-stimulatory molecules and/or cytokines induced by Mtb-infected DCs can stimulate DN1\u2009T cells to secrete this cytokine independent of TCR-CD1b interaction. Collectively, our data demonstrated that DN1\u2009T cells became activated and exhibited effector functions in response to MA-pulsed or Mtb-infected DC in a group 1 CD1-dependent manner."

Whereas BMDCs and a subset of myeloid DCs from hCD1Tg mice expressed high levels of CD1b, the expression of CD1b was almost undetectable on bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), similar to the observation in human monocyte derived macrophages. Accordingly, we detected only minimal DN1\u2009T cell activation when stimulated with Mtb-infected BMDMs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). While our data showed that Mtb-infected macrophages do not directly present antigen to DN1\u2009T cells, apoptotic vesicles released from Mtb-infected macrophages have been shown to transfer mycobacterial antigens to uninfected APCs, such as DCs (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ulrichs et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schaible et al., 2003</a>), which could in turn activate DN1\u2009T cells. To explore whether and how DN1\u2009T cells can control Mtb in infected macrophages, Mtb-infected BMDMs from WT or hCD1Tg mice were cultured together with DN1\u2009T cells in the presence or absence of uninfected WT or hCD1Tg DCs. After 7 days, we determined the number of colony forming units (CFU) to investigate whether DN1\u2009T cells inhibited intracellular bacterial growth within BMDMs. As expected, addition of DN1\u2009T cells alone did not have a significant effect on bacterial burdens in Mtb-infected BMDMs. However, when DN1\u2009T cells were added together with uninfected hCD1Tg DCs to infected BMDMs, the number of CFU decreased significantly compared with controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). For comparison, we also used Mtb-infected BMDCs from WT or hCD1Tg mice as targets. We found that DN1\u2009T cells efficiently controlled Mtb growth within infected hCD1Tg DCs but not WT DCs. Similarly, if DN1\u2009T cells and uninfected hCD1Tg DCs were added to Mtb-infected WT DCs, Mtb growth was significantly inhibited (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These data indicated that group 1 CD1-expressing DCs mediated activation of DN1\u2009T cells, which in turn controlled bacterial growth not only in the group 1 CD1-expressing DCs but also in macrophage and group 1 CD1-negative DCs. In addition, through a cytokine-blocking assay, we found that IFN-\u03b3 but not TNF-\u03b1 was crucial for mediating anti-mycobacterial function of DN1\u2009T cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>)."

Additionally, cell division was detected on DN1\u2009T cells by day 13 and on P25\u2009T cells by day 15 in the MLN (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,D</a>). Also, compared to P25\u2009T cells, a greater proportion of DN1\u2009T cells in the lung and spleen expressed CD69 and underwent cell division at day 15 post-infection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>).

This model not only allowed for the in vivo tracking of Mtb lipid antigen-specific T cells but also for deciphering their developmental requirements and functional role in Mtb infection. Like CD1d-restricted NKT cells, DN1\u2009T cells were most efficiently selected by HCs even though they did not exhibit a pre-activated phenotype. In both in vitro and in vivo Mtb infection systems, the presence of DN1\u2009T cells resulted in lower bacterial burden, indicating their role in protective immunity against Mtb. Interestingly, DN1\u2009T cells were first activated in the lung draining lymph node and seemed to have faster activation and proliferation kinetics compared to Ag85B-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The distinct kinetics of the priming of these two T cell populations may allow them to contribute to anti-mycobacterial activity at the different stages of infection.

Interestingly, MHC Ib H2-M3-restricted T cells could be selected by both HCs and TECs, however, only HC-selected T cells exhibited a pre-activated phenotype (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cho et al., 2011</a>). Additionally, CD1d-restricted iNKT cells and CD1b-autoreactive T cells, which are also pre-activated, are selected by HCs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bendelac, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Coles and Raulet, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2011</a>). Surprisingly, DN1\u2009T cells, though phenotypically na\u00efve, were most efficiently selected by HCs. This finding suggests that HC-mediated selection could lead to the development of two distinct phenotypes of group 1 CD1-restricted T cells. However, the mechanism behind this dichotomous selection process is unknown. Factors like TCR-CD1b avidity, the nature of the selecting lipid antigen(s) could all play a role in determining the phenotype of DN1\u2009T cells. The fact that CD5 expression was significantly higher on DN1\u2009T cells selected by HCs suggests that a stronger TCR-CD1b interaction ensued between HCs and DN1\u2009T cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Azzam et al., 2001</a>). The strength of the interaction could be a reflection of the high CD1b expression on DP thymocytes compared to TECs. Although a significant proportion of DN1\u2009T cells in DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice are CD8<sup>+</sup>, we did not detect differences in the activation kinetics and effector functions between CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>-</sup> DN1\u2009T cells. Also, HC-selected and TEC-selected DN1\u2009T cells in bone marrow chimeric mice have similar proportions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, suggesting that CD8 may not play a critical role in the selection and function of group 1 CD1-restricted T cells."

When CD1b-expressing DCs were infected with Mtb, DN1\u2009T cells effectively lowered bacterial burden. This response was dependent on the presence of CD1b on DCs. Additionally, when Mtb-infected BMDMs (which do not express CD1b and are known to be the natural reservoirs of Mtb) were co-cultured with uninfected CD1b-expressing DCs, DN1\u2009T cells retained their protective capacity. In this in vitro Mtb infection system, BMDMs were washed extensively after infection to remove extracellular Mtb before addition of the DCs and DN1\u2009T cells. This suggests that CD1b-expressing DCs are most likely capable of cross-presenting Mtb-lipid antigen from infected macrophages to DN1\u2009T cells. This is consistent with a previous study, which showed that upon death of mycobacteria infected-macrophages; apoptotic vesicles containing Mtb antigens are taken up by DCs, which present these antigens to T cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schaible et al., 2003</a>). When DN1\u2009T cells were adoptively transferred to Mtb-infected mice, they were first activated in the lung draining MLN instead of the lungs. Recent studies have shown that, after aerosol infection of mice with Mtb, myeloid DCs become infected in the lung, and represent the predominant cells that contain Mtb in the MLN (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wolf et al., 2007</a>). Since peripheral CD1b expression is limited to a subset of myeloid DCs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Felio et al., 2009</a>), initial DN1\u2009T cell activation could be mediated by infected CD1b-expressing DC or by uninfected DCs that cross-present MA from infected DCs migrating from the lungs. However, the events and processes leading to the presentation of MA by DCs in the MLN remain to be clearly elucidated."

Bacterial burden reduction of approximately five (lung) to ten (spleen and liver) fold was observed in various organs. This demonstrated that DN1\u2009T cells were capable of providing systemic immunity against Mtb. Numerous studies have shown that conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are critical for resistance to Mtb infection, though it\u2019s widely accepted that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells play a more dominant role (<a href=\"#bib23\">Flynn and Chan, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Woodworth and Behar, 2006</a>). Interestingly, studies using adoptive transfer of transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells reactive to Mtb antigens have yielded mixed results. While Ag85B specific T cells did not confer protection against Mtb infection (<a href=\"#bib38\">Reba et al., 2014</a>), ESAT-6 reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells reduced bacterial burden by a hundred fold, which was dependent on the infectious dose (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gallegos et al., 2008</a>). On the other hand, immune conventional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells lowered Mtb CFU by ten fold in the lungs of infected mice\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib51\">Woodworth et al., 2008</a>). Recently, the role of CD1d-restricted iNKT cells has been more appreciated in the context of in vivo Mtb infection. For example, mice that lack CD1d, the only CD1 isoform expressed in mice, did not show any differences in bacterial burden upon Mtb infection compared to wild type mice (<a href=\"#bib9\">Behar et al., 1999</a>). However, upon adoptive transfer of iNKT cells, bacterial burden was reduced five fold in the lungs, suggesting iNKT cells may play a protective role during infection (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sada-Ovalle et al., 2008</a>). Based on these studies, the protective capacity of DN1\u2009T cells appears to be comparable to that of conventional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD1d-restricted iNKT cells, suggesting an important role of CD1b-restricted T cells in anti-mycobacterial immunity."

Aside from cytokine-mediated protection, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are also capable of contributing to anti-mycobacterial immunity through their cytolytic activities. Even though T cell derived IFN-\u03b3 has been associated with macrophage activation-induced control of Mtb, several studies have shown that IFN-\u03b3 alone does not absolutely correlate with protection (<a href=\"#bib44\">Torrado et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gallegos et al., 2011</a>). However, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2 polyfunctional cytokine producing T cells have been linked to protection against mycobacteria (<a href=\"#bib17\">Darrah et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aagaard et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aagaard et al., 2009</a>). The anti-mycobacterial immunity conferred by DN1\u2009T cells was probably mediated in part by the concomitant secretion of cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2) and cytotoxicity. These data suggest that DN1\u2009T cells employ a two-pronged mechanism for contributing to anti-mycobacterial immunity. A recent study suggests that CD1d-restricted iNKT cells mediate anti-mycobacterial immunity by producing GM-CSF (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rothchild et al., 2014</a>). However, activated DN1\u2009T cells did not seem to produce significant amounts of GM-CSF, suggesting that the protective effects of DN1\u2009T cells may not be mediated by this cytokine."

Several mechanisms could contribute to the distinct kinetics of DN1\u2009T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during Mtb infection. Such mechanisms include: the selecting cell type in the thymus; availability of microbial antigen during infection; expression levels of antigen-presenting molecules and efficiency of antigen loading onto antigen presenting molecules. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that rapid DC maturation after Mtb infection induces MHC II trafficking to the plasma membrane without efficient antigen loading. On the other hand, CD1b, which continuously surveys the phagosome for antigens, is properly loaded with Mtb lipid antigen\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib29\">Hava et al., 2008</a>). This leads to earlier antigen presentation by CD1b compared to MHC II molecules. This phenomenon could at least in part explain why priming of DN1\u2009T cells occurs earlier than Ag85B-specific MHC class II-restricted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during Mtb infection."

The secretion of various cytokines, the cytotoxic capacity, and the ability to be recruited to the site of infection likely contribute to the protective effect of MA-specific T cells during Mtb infection. Additionally, these T cells are activated and proliferate earlier than conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Given these promising findings, it would be worthwhile to explore whether a multi-subunit vaccine, containing both Mtb protein and lipid antigens that activate both conventional and group 1 CD1-restricted T cells, is more effective against Mtb. Furthermore, like DN1\u2009T cells, a substantial proportion of group 1 CD1-restricted T cells are CD4 negative (<a href=\"#bib34\">Montamat-Sicotte et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gong et al., 1998</a>), and would not be affected by HIV infection. Thus, harnessing this subset of group 1 CD1-restricted T cells in vaccination strategies could prove to be particularly beneficial for HIV-infected patients."

To address this problem, the authors generated mice that express a transgene encoding a CD1b-resticted human/mouse chimeric TCR that detects mycolic acid (DN1 Tg). Taking advantage of previously generated human CD1b Tg mice, the authors show that T cells expressing the DN1 transgene are positively selected in the thymus by hematopoietic cells and respond to DC pulsed with mycolic acid or infected with Mtb. While in vitro derived macrophages do not activate DN1 Tg T cells alone, they do in the presence of uninfected DC, suggesting that the mycolic acid is transferred from macrophages to DC, which can activate T cell responses. The new mouse line allowed to study the requirements for positive selection of human CD1b-restricted T cells and to explore the capacity of these transgenic T cells to protect mice from <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infection. The new data confirm the important finding previously obtained from the same group (using a mouse line Tg for a CD1b-autoreactive human TCR), that CD1b-expressing hematopoietic cells are the main drivers of thymic positive selection. Overall, these findings provide the first clear evidence that group 1 CD1-restricted T cells can protect against <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infection. It also provides an experimental model that will be helpful to test the efficacy of lipid-based vaccines. The work therefore represents an important advance that will move the field forward."

This would eliminate the expression of endogenous TCR that may interfere with the analysis of DN1\u2009T cells. Therefore, we do not anticipate the IL-17 present in the DN1\u2009T cell and Mtb infected DC co-cultures to be a result of the unusual TCR repertoire of DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice. We speculate that co-stimulatory molecules and/or cytokines induced by Mtb-infected DCs can stimulate DN1\u2009T cells to secrete IL-17 independent of TCR-CD1b interaction (subsection \u201cDN1\u2009T cells exhibit effector functions in response to mycolic acid stimulation and Mtb infection\u201d). This explanation has been included in the Results section. The use of DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice in the Rag<sup>-/-</sup> background has been mentioned at the beginning of the Results section of our manuscript. We have now included this information in the figure legends and Materials and methods section in this version of the manuscript. In the previous review, one of the reviewers had suggested that we perform the DN1 protection assay by directly infecting DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice. By this comment, we assumed that the reviewer wanted us to infect DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice in the Rag<sup>+/+</sup> background and compare it to hCD1Tg mice in the Rag<sup>+/+</sup> background, which have an intact immune system. Since these mice have endogenous TCR rearrangement aside from the expression of DN1Tg, we explained why the use of DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice in the Rag<sup>+/+</sup> background might complicate our conclusions. In addition, we found the CD4:CD8\u2009T cell ratio in DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice in the Rag<sup>+/+</sup> background was altered compared to hCD1Tg mice in the Rag<sup>+/+</sup> background. Also, the percentage of TCR\u03b2<sup>+</sup> NK1.1<sup>+</sup> T cells was decreased in these mice. The above-mentioned observations are what we meant by an unusual TCR repertoire. We hope this explanation clarifies the questions raised by the reviewers."
