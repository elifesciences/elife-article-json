Although hypothalamic glia exist in abundance and form intimate structural connections with neurons, their roles in energy homeostasis are less known. Here we show that selective Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of glia in the mouse arcuate nucleus (ARC) reversibly induces increased food intake while disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway in ARC glia reduces food intake. The specific activation of ARC glia enhances the activity of agouti-related protein/neuropeptide Y (AgRP/NPY)-expressing neurons but induces no net response in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons. ARC glial activation non-specifically depolarizes both AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons but a strong inhibitory input to POMC neurons balances the excitation. When AgRP/NPY neurons are inactivated, ARC glial activation fails to evoke any significant changes in food intake. Collectively, these results reveal an important role of ARC glia in the regulation of energy homeostasis through its interaction with distinct neuronal subtype-specific pathways."

Although hypothalamic glia exist in abundance and form intimate structural connections with neurons, their roles in energy homeostasis are less known. Here we show that selective Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of glia in the mouse arcuate nucleus (ARC) reversibly induces increased food intake while disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway in ARC glia reduces food intake. The specific activation of ARC glia enhances the activity of agouti-related protein/neuropeptide Y (AgRP/NPY)-expressing neurons but induces no net response in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons. ARC glial activation non-specifically depolarizes both AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons but a strong inhibitory input to POMC neurons balances the excitation. When AgRP/NPY neurons are inactivated, ARC glial activation fails to evoke any significant changes in food intake. Collectively, these results reveal an important role of ARC glia in the regulation of energy homeostasis through its interaction with distinct neuronal subtype-specific pathways."

Of these, the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) is most actively studied. The key components of the feeding circuit in ARC have been identified to comprise agouti-related protein/neuropeptide Y (AgRP/NPY)-expressing neurons and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons (<a href=\"#bib6\">Aponte et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Krashes et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Zhan et al., 2013</a>), although an earlier study (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kong et al., 2012</a>) suggests other cell types may function as additional regulators.

Traditionally viewed as passive support elements, recent research has unraveled their important roles in the modulation of multiple physiological functions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gourine et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Halassa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Nedergaard et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Schummers et al., 2008</a>). GFAP-expressing hypothalamic glia, particularly astrocytes, have extensive structural connections with neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Horvath et al., 2010</a>) and also express the receptor for the satiety hormone, leptin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cheunsuang and Morris, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hsuchou et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jayaram et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kim et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pan et al., 2008</a>) and for insulin (<a href=\"#bib25\">Garc\u00eda-C\u00e1ceres et al., 2016</a>). Another type of GFAP-expressing hypothalamic glia, tanycytes, are interestingly glucosensitive and are activated by transmitters related to arousal and feeding (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bolborea and Dale, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dale, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2005</a>). These findings suggest a potential role of glia in the regulation of energy homeostasis, thereby opening up several key questions: Do GFAP-expressing hypothalamic glia play a role in the regulation of feeding? Do they functionally interact with AgRP/NPY and/or POMC neurons? If so, how does manipulation of glia in ARC affect food intake and feeding behavior? Here we demonstrate that direct and acute glial activation in the mouse ARC facilitates the activity of AgRP/NPY but not POMC neurons and is sufficient to reversibly evoke feeding. In the presence of AgRP/NPY neuronal inactivation, acute ARC glial activation did not evoke any change in feeding. In addition, disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in ARC glia leads to reduced food intake. This reveals an important role of ARC glia-AgRP/NPY neuron circuit in the regulation of energy homeostasis."

This was achieved by stereotaxic injection in ARC with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing a <i>Gfap</i> promoter-driven gene that encodes the evolved human M3-muscarinic receptor fused to mCherry (hM3D(Gq)-mCherry) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The hM3D(Gq) couples to the Gq protein-mediated signaling to activate glia upon binding of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO).

Successful bilateral viral injection in ARC was confirmed by localized expression of mCherry (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

To address this question, we assessed the effect of reduced ARC glial activity on feeding by first injecting an AAV comprising a <i>Gfap</i> promoter-driven gene that encodes the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of phospholipase C (PLC)-like protein p130 (p130PH) fused with mRFP (AAV-<i>Gfap</i>-p130PH-mRFP) in ARC. Glial expression of the p130PH construct was previously shown to disrupt the Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup> signaling in astrocytes <i>in vivo</i>\u00a0by acting as a mobile cytosolic IP<sub>3</sub> buffer to inhibit release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from internal stores (<a href=\"#bib76\">Xie et al., 2010</a>). Control animals were injected with AAV-<i>Gfap</i>-mRFP without the p130PH construct (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We compared the Fos activity of mRFP-expressing, S100B-positive ARC glia in the AAV-<i>Gfap</i>-p130PH-mRFP and AAV-<i>Gfap</i>-mRFP (control) injected animals after fasting. Indeed, the Fos activity of astrocytes in the AAV-<i>Gfap</i>-p130PH-mRFP injected animals was significantly lower than that in the control animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>: p130PH: <i>n</i> = 847 mRFP-expressing astrocytes, Control: <i>n</i> = 508 mRFP-expressing astrocytes, 8 animals each, p=0.0264, unpaired <i>t</i>-test, comparing averaged responses across astrocytes in each <i>Gfap</i>-p130PH-mRFP and control animal). The Fos activity of tanycytes, however, was not significantly different between the experimental and control groups (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

We first injected the hM3D(Gq)-mCherry virus in the ARC of <i>Npy</i>-hrGFP mice and <i>Pomc</i>-EGFP mice. Next, we performed <i>ex vivo</i> whole-cell current clamp recordings from NPY neurons (GFP-positive neurons in <i>Npy</i>-hrGFP mice) and POMC neurons (GFP-positive neurons in <i>Pomc</i>-EGFP mice) in brain slices containing hM3D(Gq)-mCherry-expressing ARC glia (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Interestingly, CNO activation of the hM3D(Gq)-mCherry-expressing ARC glia depolarized and/or increased the firing rate of AgRP/NPY neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>: <i>n</i> = 15 neurons in 15 slices from 9 animals, p&lt;0.0001, unpaired <i>t</i>-test, comparing CNO-induced responses with null responses; averaged resting membrane potential: \u221252.2 \u00b1 2.65 mV [<a href=\"#bib70\">van den Top et al., 2004</a>]).

These findings were further validated by first injecting both <i>Npy</i>-hrGFP and <i>Pomc</i>-EGFP mice (with hM3D(Gq)-mCherry-expressing ARC glia) with either CNO or saline before performing Fos immunohistochemistry. Indeed, greater Fos immunoreactivity was observed after CNO injection as compared to saline injection in NPY but not POMC neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E,F</a>: <i>n</i> = 5 <i>Npy</i>-hrGFP animals each for CNO and saline injections, p=0.0428, unpaired <i>t</i>-test, comparing CNO and saline induced responses; <i>n</i> = 5 and n = 6 <i>Pomc</i>-EGFP animals for CNO and saline injections respectively, p=0.736, unpaired <i>t</i>-test, comparing CNO and saline induced responses).

Is this due to the intimate organization between astrocytes and specific neuronal subtypes? Or do astrocytes indiscriminately facilitate both AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons but their net responses shaped by the presence of a strong AgRP to POMC inhibition (<a href=\"#bib9\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>)? To dissect these possibilities, we first recorded spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) from POMC neurons during CNO activation of hM3D(Gq)-mCherry-expressing ARC glia. Indeed, CNO evoked an increase in the frequency (but not amplitude) of sIPSCs in POMC neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> <i>top</i>, 6B: <i>n</i> = 7 neurons in 7 slices in 3 animals, Amplitude: p=0.324; Frequency: p=0.0078, paired <i>t</i>-test, comparing normalized responses before and after CNO application). This observation reveals strong inhibition received by POMC neurons during glial activation, possibly via NPY neuronal activation. To test if facilitatory responses in POMC neurons evoked by glial activation can be unmasked when the strong inhibition they receive is blocked, we recorded the CNO-evoked responses in POMC neurons in the presence of GABA receptor (GABAR) blockers (50\u2009\u03bcM Picrotoxin, a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist and 20\u2009\u03bcM SCH-50911, a GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist, see Materials and methods: Slice physiology). Interestingly, CNO evoked strong depolarization in POMC neurons when patched in the presence of GABAR blockers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> <i>bottom</i>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>: Control: <i>n</i> = 14 neurons in 14 slices in 6 animals, GABAR blockers: <i>n</i> = 7 neurons in 7 slices in 5 animals, p=0.0046, unpaired <i>t</i>-test, comparing responses between in the absence and presence of GABAR blockers). These data support our hypothesis that astrocytic activation facilitates both AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons indiscriminately. Unlike AgRP/NPY neurons, however, the presence of a strong inhibitory input, possibly due to the activation of AgRP/NPY-POMC inhibitory connection (<a href=\"#bib9\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>) during glial activation, can further shape the net responses of POMC neurons. Our data thus suggest that ARC glial activation indiscriminately facilitates both AgRP/NPY neurons and POMC neurons but the presence of an inhibitory input leads to no net response in POMC neurons, thereby providing a mechanistic understanding of the glial activation-induced increase in feeding."

In <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, the amplitude and frequency of each event in the 120\u00a0s segment before and after CNO application was quantified before the population average was taken over all events in the respective segments.

Fluorescence was continuously excited using a Lumen 200/220 (Prior Scientific, MA, USA). OGB1-AM and mCherry were imaged with a blue excitation filter/green emission filter and a green excitation filter/red emission filter, respectively. Images were continuously acquired at 1.25\u2009Hz, using 1x1 binning. Images were saved by the CellSens software as tagged image fileformat files and analyzed with both ImageJ (NIH) and custom-written MATLAB scripts. Individual cells were circled manually based on the mCherry expression. The mean fluorescence for each cell was computed from frame to frame, giving a time-varying intensity signal for each cell. After correction for lamp flicker noise and dye photobleaching, dFF was calculated by subtracting the local corresponding baseline (F) from the peak of the response to get dF before taking the ratio by F. Increases in dFF in ROIs indicated an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration."

The ARC is a fairly long structure spanning almost 1 mm both rostral to caudal and medial to lateral. It would be insightful if the authors made some sort of schematic to display the expression of the hM3D(Gq) virus. I imagine glia are present throughout the ARC and importantly throughout the entire hypothalamus. How certain are the authors that DREADD expression was specific for the ARC? Additional images would help convince the reader that they are selectively manipulating their intended targets. This becomes particularly critical when comparing the results here to the previous findings of Yang et al., 2015 whereby GFAP- hM3D(Gq) was expressed throughout the medialbasal hypothalamus."

Although the light cycle is normally a time for calorically replete mice to rest, most reports observe feeding behavior during this time of about 10-20% of an animal's daily food intake. An explanation for this discrepancy could be the custom-designed cages versus home cage which could induce additional stressors on the animals even following the acclimation period. This very low baseline makes the CNO versus saline GFAP- hM3D(Gq) effects appear disproportionately large. Again, this could be due to the specific behavioral setup but perhaps home cage assessment of food intake may strengthen this claim."

For example, it is quite remarkable that these mice show such a sharp reduction in cumulative food intake; does this result in a leaner phenotype over an extended period of time? How does this compare to other manipulations that result in a drastic decrease in feeding behavior?"

However, although this would explain the reduction of feeding observed in the Yang et al., 2015 paper using GFAP- hM3D(Gq), it contradicts the GFAP-hM4D(Gi) elevated ghrelin-evoked feeding and blunted leptin-induced anorexia (both net gains of food intake) observed previously.

Besides its effect on feeding, ARC glia may also regulate energy expenditure. Regulation of energy expenditure via glia may be mediated through GABAergic RIP-Cre neurons that also exist in the ARC and are well known as regulators of energy balance (D. Kong et al., Cell, 2012). The simultaneous regulation of feeding and energy expenditure by glia may account for the lack of change in body weight in the Gq-DREADD experiments (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) and p130PH experiments (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."
