The mechanism by which subunit exchange occurs remains elusive. We show that the human CaMKII holoenzyme exists in dodecameric and tetradecameric forms, and that the calmodulin (CaM)-binding element of CaMKII can bind to the hub of the holoenzyme and destabilize it to release dimers. The structures of CaMKII from two distantly diverged organisms suggest that the CaM-binding element of activated CaMKII acts as a wedge by docking at intersubunit interfaces in the hub. This converts the hub into a spiral form that can release or gain CaMKII dimers. Our data reveal a three-way competition for the CaM-binding element, whereby phosphorylation biases it towards the hub interface, away from the kinase domain and calmodulin, thus unlocking the ability of activated CaMKII holoenzymes to exchange dimers with unactivated ones."

The mechanism by which subunit exchange occurs remains elusive. We show that the human CaMKII holoenzyme exists in dodecameric and tetradecameric forms, and that the calmodulin (CaM)-binding element of CaMKII can bind to the hub of the holoenzyme and destabilize it to release dimers. The structures of CaMKII from two distantly diverged organisms suggest that the CaM-binding element of activated CaMKII acts as a wedge by docking at intersubunit interfaces in the hub. This converts the hub into a spiral form that can release or gain CaMKII dimers. Our data reveal a three-way competition for the CaM-binding element, whereby phosphorylation biases it towards the hub interface, away from the kinase domain and calmodulin, thus unlocking the ability of activated CaMKII holoenzymes to exchange dimers with unactivated ones."

One enzyme that is found in neurons and has been suggested to help long-term memories to form is called CaMKII. Each CaMKII assembly is typically composed of 12 to 14 protein subunits associated in a ring and can exist in either an \u201cunactivated\u201d or \u201cactivated\u201d state. In 2014, researchers showed that CaMKII assemblies can exchange subunits with each other. Importantly, an active CaMKII can mix with an unactivated CaMKII and share its activation state. CaMKII may use this mechanism to spread information to the next generation of proteins \u2013 thereby allowing activation to outlast the lifespan of the initially activated proteins. However the molecular mechanism that underlies this process was not clear."

This segment, which is exposed in activated CaMKII but not in the unactivated form, can crack open the hub ring by binding between the hub subunits, like a finger separating the segments of an orange. This allows the hub to flex and expand, and once open, the hub\u2019s flexibility allows room for subunits to be released or accepted."

To do this, we made a construct comprised\u00a0of the hub, the linker and the autoinhibitory segment of CaMKII-\u03b1, without the kinase domain (denoted hub-\u25b3kinase). The construct includes an N-terminal SUMO tag, which reduced proteolysis during purification. We monitored the gain of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in order to test subunit exchange kinetics for this construct, by mixing samples labeled separately with donor and acceptor fluorophores, at a subunit concentration of ~5\u2009\u03bcM, as described (<a href=\"#bib91\">Stratton et al., 2014</a>). We observed that the hub-\u25b3kinase construct undergoes robust subunit exchange (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast, the isolated hub of CaMKII-\u03b1, lacking the autoinhibitory segment and the linker, does not exchange subunits (<a href=\"#bib91\">Stratton et al., 2014</a>). We also made a construct that spans the linker segment and the hub (residues 314 to 475, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; referred to as hub-linker). We observe robust subunit exchange only when the CaM-binding element is present in both samples (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). That is, a hub construct bearing the CaM-binding element cannot efficiently break a hub assembly lacking this element. We have shown previously that activated CaMKII holoenzyme, including the kinase domains, undergoes subunit exchange with unactivated holoenzymes (<a href=\"#bib91\">Stratton et al., 2014</a>).

We purified CaMKII-\u03b2 using a bacterial expression system, and tested its ability to undergo subunit exchange. We mixed proteins, labeled separately with donor and acceptor fluorophores and at a subunit concentration of ~5\u2009\u03bcM, and monitored the development of FRET (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

This docking allows the C-terminal end of the tag to connect to the N-terminal end of the first \u03b1-helix in the hub domain proper. The mouse CaMKII-\u03b1 hub, which is 100% identical in sequence over the region spanning the human hub, was crystallized previously as a tetradecamer, rather than the dodecamer seen here (PDB code: 1HKX) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hoelz et al., 2003</a>). The groove between adjacent subunits is necessarily narrower in the tetradecamer than in the dodecamer, because of the hinging apart of the subunits, and the presence of the expression tag could favor the dodecamer for this reason."

This leads to the formation of a spiral, similar to a \u201clock-washer\u201d, with a slight opening between the A-B and M-N dimers (subunit notation is indicated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We modeled how the CaM-binding element might dock on the hub by aligning a hub subunit from the <i>N. vectensis</i> CaMKII-B structure on to subunits of dodecameric human CaMKII-\u03b3 (PDB code: 2UX0) and tetradecameric mouse CaMKII-\u03b1 (PDB code: 1HKX).

Remarkably, the structural change closely resembles the difference seen between the ring-opened <i>N. vectensis</i> CaMKII-B hub and the closed tetradecameric rings in <i>N. vectensis</i> CaMKII-A and mouse CaMKII-\u03b1. Thus, we propose that electrostatic complementarity between the CaM-binding element and the hub interface allows the docking of this element onto the hub. Engagement of the interface by the CaM-binding element then results in a conformational change that favors a ring-opened \u201clock-washer\u201d configuration of the assembly, rather than a closed ring."

To answer this, we compared the <i>S. rosetta</i> hub structure with that of other hubs (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). Each hub domain consists of two layers: an inner layer that consists of a four-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet and an outer layer formed by three \u03b1-helices, which precede the inner layer in sequence (two shorter additional strands of the \u03b2-sheet form a segment that intervenes between two of the \u03b1-helices). The principal structural difference between a subunit in a closed-ring hub and one in the spiral <i>S. rosetta</i> hub is a rotation in the outer edge of the \u03b2-sheet with respect to the inner edge of the sheet and the \u03b1-helices (see <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). The interfacial interactions between the vertical dimers of the hub are between residues on the outer edge of the \u03b2-sheet in one subunit, and residues presented by helix D in the other. These interfacial interactions are preserved in the <i>S. rosetta</i> hub, but a change in the curvature of the \u03b2-sheet results in a change in the orientation of helix D in each subunit.

Subunit exchange in CaMKII requires a remarkable degree of architectural flexibility in the hub domain, which has long been an under-appreciated component of CaMKII. Although it gives the holoenzyme its distinctive shape and symmetry, the hub domain has neither the catalytic activity nor the sites of regulatory post-translational modification that has focused attention on the kinase domain and the autoinhibitory segment. We now show that the hub domain enables the CaMKII holoenzyme to switch between closed-ring dodecameric and tetradecameric states, and to potentially adopt ring-opened spiral configurations that can reversibly add and release dimer units to enable subunit exchange and interconversion between these states (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>)."

The fold of these enzymes, which is also shared by binding proteins such as nuclear transport factor 2 (<a href=\"#bib90\">Stewart et al., 1998</a>), creates an active site between the helical layer and the \u03b2 sheet. As noted earlier, this cavity is deeper in CaMKII than in the enzymes to which it is related (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hoelz et al., 2003</a>). The cavity in the CaMKII hub contains several highly conserved charged residues, including three arginines. The positioning of these charged residues in an invagination between the two layers of the domain is what makes the hub domain so flexible \u2013 the cavity between the layers is solvated, and therefore able to readily accommodate changes in shape."

Our data suggest that the CaM-binding element has an additional function, which is to dock at the interfaces between hub dimers, and thereby distort the hub assembly. Our data are consistent with the idea that the CaM-binding element induces the hub to transition from a closed-ring form to a ring-opened lock-washer configuration, which can release or capture dimer units. One attractive feature of this model, which is not directly tested here, is that subunit exchange need not involve complete disassembly and reassembly of the hub, which is likely to be a much less efficient process."

One system in which such a process is thought to occur is the molecular clock formed by the KaiABC complex, which maintains diurnal rhythm in cyanobacteria (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kageyama et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Markson and O'Shea, 2009</a>). The exchange of histone subunits between existing nucleosomes and newly synthesized ones may be part of the mechanism by which epigenetic modifications are maintained during replication and transcription (<a href=\"#bib7\">Campos et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Xu et al., 2010</a>). A form of activation-dependent subunit exchange underlies the function of the Mad2 protein in controlling chromosome separation (<a href=\"#bib71\">Musacchio, 2015</a>). Certain oligomeric enzymes undergo alterations in the stoichiometry and architecture of their quaternary structures in response to the binding of allosteric effectors, a process that involves disassembly and reassembly of the subunits (<a href=\"#bib87\">Selwood and Jaffe, 2012</a>). Activation-triggered subunit exchange provides a general mechanism to synchronize the functional states of a population of molecules, so that changes initiated by an input signal can spread from a small number of activated assemblies to many. CaMKII functions at synapses and in neuromuscular junctions, and our findings explain how its activation triggers the release of dimers that can spread and maintain the effects of calcium spikes. We anticipate that the structural mechanism we have delineated will enable future experiments in which mutations designed to alter subunit exchange in CaMKII are correlated with changes in its many crucial signaling functions."

The chromatography system was coupled to an 18-angle light scattering detector (DAWN HELEOS-II) and a refractive index detector (Optilab T-rEX) (Wyatt Technology). Data were collected every second and the flow rate was set to 0.5\u2009ml/min. Data analysis was carried out using the program ASTRA (Wyatt Technology). Monomeric bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) was used for calibration of the light scattering detectors and data quality control. Measurement was carried out at 25\u00b0C."

The ff99SB-ILDN force field (<a href=\"#bib51\">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010</a>) was used for all the calculations. All simulations were carried out in water using the TIP3P water model and appropriate counter ions (Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>) were added to neutralize the net charges. After initial energy minimization, the systems were subjected to 100\u2013500 ps of constant number, volume and temperature (NVT) equilibration, during which the system was heated to 300K. This was followed by a short equilibration at constant number, pressure and temperature (NPT, 100\u2013500 ps). The equilibration steps were performed with harmonic positional restraints on all protein or peptide atoms. For the simulation with the tetradecamer\u00a0and\u00a0dodecamer bound to the RRKLK motif-containing peptide, additional steps of NVT and NPT equilibrations were added with harmonic positional restraints on the protein but not on the peptide atoms. Finally, the production simulations were performed under NPT conditions, with the Berendsen and v-rescale thermostats in Amber14 and Gromacs 5.1.0 respectively, in the absence of positional restraints. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed, and particle-mesh Ewald summations were used for long-range electrostatics and the van der Waals cut-off was set at 1 nm. A time step of 2 fs was employed and the structures were stored every 2 ps."

In this model, the linker between the kinase domain and the hub domain, upon activation, is free to bind to the \"horizontal\" subunit interface in the hub. This changes the geometry in the interface subtly, but the change is sufficient to \"crack open\" the hub structure, allowing entry of a (\"vertical\") dimeric CaMKII unit. The model is nicely supported by a myriad of experiments including negative-stain electron microscopy, crystallography, FRET, normal-mode analysis, and molecular dynamics. Although other aspects of the CaMKII activation process, as they relate to the functional significance of subunit exchange, are not addressed here, this study represents a substantive advance in our understanding of CaMKII and merits publication in <i>eLife</i>."

Our new experiments (see above) show that a construct containing the hub and the linker, without the CaM-binding element, does not exchange subunits, and so CaM should inhibit the process in the absence of phosphorylation. We agree that it would be interesting to study the effect of CaM on the exchange process, but do not feel that such experiments would provide a critical conceptual advance."

                    "text": "We appreciate what the reviewer is getting at: does phosphorylation potentiate the ability of the autoinhibitory segment (including the CaM-binding element) to mediate exchange? We had, indeed, thought that this would be an important experiment to do, but quickly discovered a problem intrinsic to the experiment. The free autoinhibitory segment is a potent inhibitor of the kinase domain. We have now mentioned this point in paragraph two, subheading \u201cThe CaM-binding element of CaMKII binds to the hub with micromolar affinity\u201d of the revised manuscript. Shown below are kinetic traces from a coupled-kinase assay, in which the kinase domain (without the autoinhibitory segment) is used as an enzyme to phosphorylate either a synthetic substrate (syntide) or peptide derived from the CaM-binding element. The assay monitors the depletion of ATP via changes in the concentration of NADH (Barker et al. 1995; Chao et al. 2010). Note that with syntide as a substrate, there is rapid diminution of signal until ATP is exhausted. Addition of CaM-binding element peptide as a substrate leads to no activity."

                    "text": "This result, which is consistent with the published literature on CaMKII activity, shows that phosphorylation in the holoenzyme is presumably mediated by transient dynamics of the autoinhibitory segment when it is presented to an enzyme at the high local concentrations of the subunits in the holoenzyme. When the autoinhibitory segment is presented in trans the inhibitory binding mode dominates, and we presume that phosphorylation occurs too rarely to be detected. This is an unfortunate result in terms of doing the experiment that the reviewer has suggested. We have not thought it worthwhile, at this point, to explore the use of unrelated kinases to carry out the phosphorylation, since we do not know what such a kinase might be. Note that our previous work (Stratton et al. 2014) indicated that phosphorylation is important, because mutation of either Thr 305 or Thr 306 reduced subunit exchange. We regret that the parameters of the system do not allow us to do the proposed experiment."
