                    "text": "Kinesin-1 is a dimeric motor that transports cargo along microtubules, taking 8.2-nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion. The ATP hydrolysis cycles of its two heads are maintained out of phase by a series of gating mechanisms, which lead to processive runs averaging \u223c1 \u03bcm. A key structural element for inter-head coordination is the neck linker (NL), which connects the heads to the stalk. To examine the role of the NL in regulating stepping, we investigated NL mutants of various lengths using single-molecule optical trapping and bulk fluorescence approaches in the context of a general framework for gating. Our results show that, although inter-head tension enhances motor velocity, it is crucial neither for inter-head coordination nor for rapid rear-head release. Furthermore, cysteine-light mutants do not produce wild-type motility under load. We conclude that kinesin-1 is primarily front-head gated, and that NL length is tuned to enhance unidirectional processivity and velocity."

The ATP hydrolysis cycles of its two heads are maintained out of phase by a series of gating mechanisms, which lead to processive runs averaging \u223c1 \u03bcm. A key structural element for inter-head coordination is the neck linker (NL), which connects the heads to the stalk. To examine the role of the NL in regulating stepping, we investigated NL mutants of various lengths using single-molecule optical trapping and bulk fluorescence approaches in the context of a general framework for gating. Our results show that, although inter-head tension enhances motor velocity, it is crucial neither for inter-head coordination nor for rapid rear-head release. Furthermore, cysteine-light mutants do not produce wild-type motility under load. We conclude that kinesin-1 is primarily front-head gated, and that NL length is tuned to enhance unidirectional processivity and velocity."

Kinesins are a large family of such motors that transport their cargos along long filaments known as microtubules. Most kinesin molecules are formed from two identical protein chains.

The other end of each protein chain wraps around its partner to form a common stalk region (called the tail) that links to the cargo being carried."

During each step, the front head remains tightly associated with the filament as the trailing head releases itself, advances beyond the front head, and reattaches to become the new leading head. The two heads need to coordinate their activities, so that at any given time, they're not at the same stage in the process. For example, if both heads remained bound to the microtubule at the same time, the motor would not be able to advance. If they both released, the motor would fall off the filament and diffuse away. However, the process by which the heads coordinate is not fully understood, and different models for how this process works have been proposed."

It was found that kinesins can still walk even when each neck linker was extended by up to six additional amino acids. However, introducing even a single amino acid into the linker relaxed the normal tension that exists between the heads when these are both bound to the filament. This resulted in slowed speeds, shorter distances of travel, and less ability to sustain loads. The experimental results suggest that the length of the neck linker in naturally occurring kinesins may be optimized to support maximum movement. Based on their data, Andreasson, Milic et al. propose a general framework for understanding the communication that needs to take place between the heads in order to walk in a coordinated manner. Further work is required to understand if motor proteins other than kinesins can also be understood with this same framework."

Each kinesin dimer is composed of a pair of identical catalytic motor domains, or heads, which are connected to a common, coiled-coil stalk by a \u223c14-amino-acid-long sequence known as the neck linker (NL) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kozielski et al., 1997</a>). Kinesin translocates towards the plus-ends of MTs (<a href=\"#bib65\">Svoboda et al., 1993</a>) via an asymmetric hand-over-hand mechanism (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asbury et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Yildiz et al., 2004</a>), hydrolyzing one molecule of ATP (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hua et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Schnitzer and Block, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Coy et al., 1999</a>) for each 8.2-nm step (<a href=\"#bib65\">Svoboda et al., 1993</a>) the motor takes. The biochemical states associated with each kinesin head during stepping are coupled to mechanical transitions in an overall mechanochemical cycle: biochemical events modulate the affinities of heads to the MT and influence mechanical transitions, and mechanical states, in turn, influence the rates of biochemical processes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Block, 2007</a>)."

A simplified version of this cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) may arbitrarily be taken to begin with the one-head-bound (1-HB), ATP-waiting state [\u03b1], where the nucleotide-free front head is strongly bound to the MT while the rear, ADP-bound tethered head remains unbound (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hackney, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Asenjo and Sosa, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Guydosh and Block, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Toprak et al., 2009</a>). Following ATP binding to the MT-bound head, the NL of its motor domain undergoes a structural reconfiguration and forms a \u03b2-sheet with the head, in a process termed <i>NL docking</i> (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rice et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schnitzer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rosenfeld et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Asenjo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tomishige et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Khalil et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sindelar and Downing, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>). NL docking shifts the position of the tethered head towards the MT plus-end, beyond the position of the bound head [\u03b2<sub>1</sub>, \u03b2<sub>2</sub>]. Recent work has suggested that NL docking may occur in two stages: first, ATP binding induces a load-dependent mechanical transition, leading to partial NL docking [\u03b2<sub>1</sub>], whereas subsequent ATP hydrolysis completes the docking and enables the tethered head to bind the MT [\u03b2<sub>2</sub>] (<a href=\"#bib43\">Milic et al., 2014</a>). Once the bound head hydrolyzes ATP, fully docks its NL, and the tethered head binds the MT, the motor enters a mechanically strained, two-heads-bound (2-HB) state [\u03b3] (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rice et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Block, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yildiz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gennerich and Vale, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>). Finally, rear-head release (<a href=\"#bib36\">Klumpp et al., 2004</a>) completes the step and returns the motor to its initial 1-HB waiting state [\u03b1], primed to begin the cycle anew, after having translocated forward by one step (8.2 nm) along the MT. The processivity of kinesin\u2014evinced by the ability of a single dimer to undergo &gt;100 consecutive stepping cycles before dissociation\u2014relies upon a tight coordination of the biochemical and mechanical events, collectively known as <i>gating mechanisms</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Block, 2007</a>)."

Kinesin starts from the one-head-bound (1-HB) ATP-waiting state [\u03b1], characterized by a strongly bound, nucleotide-free (\u00d8) front head (red) and an unbound, ADP-containing tethered head (blue). ATP binding induces a force-dependent transition involving partial NL docking, shifting the tethered head past the bound head [\u03b2<sub>1</sub>]. ATP hydrolysis completes NL docking and facilitates tethered-head binding [\u03b2<sub>2</sub>]. At this point, kinesin may access a dissociated state [Off], induced by premature phosphate release from the bound head, leading to dimer detachment. However, if the tethered head reaches the forward MT binding site and completes the step before the bound head can dissociate, kinesin enters the two-heads-bound (2-HB) state [\u03b3]. Rear-head release returns the dimer to the ATP-waiting state [\u03b1], having moved forward by 8.2 nm. (<b>B</b>) A simplified general gating framework, based on the cycle in (<b>A</b>). Stepping, binding, and unbinding gates are shown with associated rate constants between each of the three gated states, [A], [B], and [C]. The cycle begins at the 1-HB ATP-waiting state [A], where the stepping gate promotes processivity by inhibiting rear-head (blue) rebinding and premature bound-head (red) release. Following a force-dependent step that shifts the tethered head past the bound head [B], the binding gate promotes binding of the tethered head at the forward MT binding site while inhibiting release of the bound head. Also shown is a competing dissociated state [Off], arising from premature release of the bound head from the 1-HB state, accessible from either [A] or [B]. Tethered-head binding leads to the 2-HB state [C], where the unbinding gate promotes rear-head release while inhibiting front-head release, returning the motor to the start of the cycle [A]."

Starting from a 1-HB state, with the tethered head positioned behind the MT-bound head [A], unidirectional processivity necessitates a <i>stepping gate</i> that stabilizes binding by the front head while inhibiting any rebinding by the rear head. Following a structural transition that shifts the tethered head beyond the bound head [B], a <i>binding gate</i> acts to promote tethered-head binding at the forward site, while preventing premature unbinding of the rear head, which would otherwise lead to dissociation [Off]. Once the tethered head binds successfully, and the motor achieves the 2-HB state [C], an <i>unbinding gate</i> is required to retain the front head on the MT, while promoting the release of the rear head. Finally, rear-head release completes the cycle, returning the motor to its initial state [A], but advanced by one step. We note that this abstraction is agnostic with respect to the biochemical state associated with each mechanical transition. However, precisely because these biochemical states are unspecified, this general framework (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) can be applied not only to kinesin but also to other processive, two-headed motors that may couple mechanical and biochemical states differently (<a href=\"#bib6\">Block, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gennerich and Vale, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kull and Endow, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cleary et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "Here, we used the gating framework to guide an investigation of the role of the NL domain in determining kinesin processivity, which remains incompletely understood, despite considerable research (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hackney et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Block, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yildiz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shastry and Hancock, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib60\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>). Because intramolecular forces within the kinesin dimer are thought to be transmitted through the NL of each head, the NL domain is well situated to play a role in gating. Consistent with this, extending the NL by mutation has previously been shown to affect kinesin processivity, velocity, and stepping behavior (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hackney et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Block, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yildiz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shastry and Hancock, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib60\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>). In principle, perturbing the properties of the NL by inserting additional amino acids (AA) at the junction of the NL domain and the coiled-coil stalk could affect some, or all, of the gates in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. When kinesin is in its 1-HB state [A, B], the NL might serve to suppress rear-head rebinding in the ATP-waiting state [A], as part of the stepping gate, or to promote tethered-head binding (following NL docking) in the bound head [B], as part of the binding gate. When kinesin is in a 2-HB state [C], the NL can transmit inter-head tension, affecting the unbinding gate (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Guydosh and Block, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Block, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yildiz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hariharan and Hancock, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shastry and Hancock, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib60\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>). The unbinding gate may act through (i) <i>front-head gating</i>, where biochemical events on the front head are suppressed until the rear head has a chance to detach (candidate mechanisms include the suppression of ATP hydrolysis in the front head, reduced ATP binding arising from inter-head tension, or reduced ATP binding caused by the rearward-pointing configuration of the NL), or through (ii) <i>rear-head gating</i>, where the rear-head release rate is accelerated by the inter-head tension, or (iii) some combination of the two (<a href=\"#bib6\">Block, 2007</a>). Because inter-head tension is directly controlled by the length of the NL domain, an understanding of the relationship between NL length and the unbinding gate is central to evaluating tension-based gating models."

Published models have invoked both versions of rear-head gating (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hancock and Howard, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crevel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schief et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yildiz et al., 2008</a>) and front-head gating (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Klumpp et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Guydosh and Block, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Toprak et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>). The conversation about kinesin gating has heretofore focused on how inter-head coordination might be achieved from the 2-HB state, that is, from the unbinding gate. Comparatively little attention has been paid to gating at other points of the kinesin cycle, specifically at the stepping and binding gates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), and quantitative measures of the competing rates responsible for gating have been notably lacking. Here, we examine the quantitative contribution of each of the three gates to maintaining unidirectional processivity by assessing the effects of NL length on kinesin motility, and attempt to reframe the discussion of gating from a debate about front- vs rear-head gating at the 2-HB state to a more unified view that admits to gating at multiple states of the mechanochemical cycle, both 1-HB and 2-HB. Towards that end, we examined a series of truncated <i>Drosophila</i> kinesin constructs (DmK) containing NLs that were extended incrementally, from 1 to 6 AA (DmK-1AA to DmK-6AA), using a combination of single-molecule optical trapping and bulk fluorescence approaches."

To investigate the influence of NL length on this rebinding, we performed a series of half-site ADP release experiments using mantADP, a fluorescent ADP analog, on a set of truncated constructs with extended NL domains. Because free kinesin heads in solution have a high affinity for ADP, whereas MT-bound heads exhibit a substantially lower affinity, the release of mantADP from kinesin heads serves as a proxy for the binding of free heads to MTs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hackney, 1988</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gilbert et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hackney et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>). Binding was assayed by pre-incubating motors in mantADP and subsequently monitoring the MT-stimulated decay of fluorescence upon the introduction of MTs via stopped-flow. Wild-type (WT) <i>Drosophila</i> kinesin (DmK-WT), as well as constructs with NLs extended by up to 3 AA, displayed a 50% reduction in fluorescence following the addition of MTs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), consistent with being in a 1-HB state, where only one of the two heads is bound to the MT and releases mantADP. By contrast, constructs with NL inserts consisting of 4, 5, or 6 AA exhibited progressively greater drops in fluorescence upon the addition of MTs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). These decreases correspond to 16% of DmK-4AA, 38% of DmK-5AA, and 65% of DmK-6AA motors releasing mantADP from both heads, respectively. In principle, the increased mantADP release could arise from (i) the additional NL length facilitating transient rear-head rebinding events, (ii) more motors adopting a stable 2-HB ATP-waiting state, or (iii) some combination of both. These findings are consistent with previous work, which has also reported a \u223c50% fluorescence decrease for WT kinesin, and a nearly 100% fluorescence decrease for constructs carrying a 6-AA NL insert (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hackney, 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hackney et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>). Additional mantADP exchange experiments\u2014where the frequency of transient rear-head interactions with the MT was assessed based on the effective rate of mantADP exchange at the rear head\u2014revealed an order-of-magnitude increase relative to WT kinesin once the NL domain was extended by 4 or more AA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The low mantADP exchange rates observed for our series of constructs are consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hackney, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hackney et al., 2003</a>). Taken all together, these results indicate that kinesin can maintain a stable, 1-HB ATP-waiting state with up to 3 additional AA in its NL, but that extending the NL by 4 AA or more leads to an abrupt increase in rebinding of the rear-head to the MT."

Further increments in the NL length (up to 6 AA) yielded only minor decreases in run length relative to DmK-1AA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Under unloaded conditions, DmK-6AA was capable of taking several dozen consecutive forward steps, on average, before dissociating, indicating that kinesin retains significant processivity with as many as 6 AA introduced into its NL. In the presence of forces applied either against (hindering loads) or along (assisting loads) the direction of kinesin motility (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <i>inset</i>), the differences in processivity among constructs with differing NL lengths were substantially more pronounced under hindering forces than under assisting forces. Although the unloaded run lengths for DmK-WT and DmK-1AA differed by a factor of 3, the differences in run length between these constructs under assisting loads were comparatively minor. A gradual, exponential decrease in run length was observed for all constructs under increasing hindering loads, but the application of even a small assisting force (+2 pN) abruptly reduced the run length for both the WT and NL-mutant constructs. Based on exponential fits to the mean run lengths as a function of applied load, the characteristic distance parameter for the force dependence of run length, \u03b4<i><sub>L</sub></i>, was nearly an order of magnitude greater under hindering-load conditions than under assisting-load conditions for all constructs (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

To determine the extent to which the NL length affects this competition, we examined the influence of 100 mM potassium phosphate on the processivity of DmK-6AA, under moderate assisting loads (+4 pN). Under saturating levels of ATP, the addition of P<sub>i</sub> increased the DmK-6AA run length relative to that in its absence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, no statistically significant changes in processivity were detected at low ATP concentrations, nor under conditions where ATP was replaced with the slowly hydrolyzable analog, ATP\u03b3S, nor in the presence of 100 mM potassium chloride (used as a control for ionic strength effects) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Although run lengths under otherwise identical assay conditions were systematically lower for DmK-6AA than for DmK-WT, those differences disappeared when the data were normalized relative to the baseline run lengths (no added P<sub>i</sub>) for each motor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

As discussed previously, the unbinding gate might consist of a rear-head gating mechanism, where the inter-head tension enhances the rate of rear-head release. If detachment of the trailing head is accelerated by inter-head tension, then extending the NL would be expected to relieve the tension and decrease the rear-head release rate, thereby reducing the overall rate at which kinesin proceeds around the reaction cycle. To explore the effect of inter-head tension on rear-head gating, we performed single-molecule measurements of the velocity of our kinesin constructs as a function of load."

Whereas the insertion of a single AA in the NL elicited a drop in velocity across all loads, additional NL insertions produced no further changes in velocity: indeed, <i>Drosophila</i> kinesin stepped at significant rates with as many as 6 additional AA in its NL. In contrast to DmK-WT, which is not sped up by assisting loads, the reduction in unloaded velocity produced by NL extension could be recovered by applying larger assisting loads (\u223c20 pN). These data are consistent with the explanation that inter-head tension, which can promote rear-head release, is effectively abolished by extending the NL past its WT length, but that the reduced tension can be restored by applying assisting load, which places differential stress on the rear head. However, the finding that assisting load fails to appreciably increase the WT velocity suggests that the rate of rear-head release by WT kinesin must be substantially higher than the rate-limiting step(s) of the mechanochemical cycle. If the rate of rear-head release were instead rate-limiting, then any acceleration of that step would have manifested as an increase in motor velocity."

The first transition in this cycle consists of the force-producing mechanical step, [1] \u2192 [2], which is modeled by a force-dependent rate, <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mi>k</mi><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn></msubsup><mtext>exp</mtext><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mtext>trap</mtext></mrow></msub><msub><mo>\u03b4</mo><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mtext>B</mtext></msub><mi>T</mi></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></math> where <math id=\"inf3\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>k</mi><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn></msubsup></mrow></math> is the unloaded rate constant, <i>F</i><sub>trap</sub> is the applied force, \u03b4<sub>1</sub> is a characteristic distance parameter, and <i>k</i><sub>B</sub><i>T</i> is Boltzmann's constant times the absolute temperature. Because kinesin is in a 1-HB ATP-waiting state [1] prior to this transition, the inter-head tension, <i>F</i><sub>i</sub>, has no effect on <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>. The following transition, [2] \u2192 [3], consists of ATP hydrolysis and related events\u2014including the completion of NL docking by the MT-bound head, front-head binding to the MT, and ADP release by the new front head\u2014that induce kinesin to enter the strained, 2-HB state [3]. Because this transition corresponds to the completion of the key biochemical steps in the cycle, the associated rate constant, <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>, is modeled as being independent of load. From the 2-HB state [3], the final transition of the cycle consists of rear-head release (which is also load-dependent) and is modeled as <math id=\"inf4\"><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mi>k</mi><mn>3</mn><mn>0</mn></msubsup><mtext>exp</mtext><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mtext>trap</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mtext>i</mtext></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow><msub><mo>\u03b4</mo><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mtext>B</mtext></msub><mi>T</mi></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></math>, where <math id=\"inf5\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>k</mi><mn>3</mn><mn>0</mn></msubsup></mrow></math> is the unloaded rate constant and \u03b4<sub>3</sub> is the associated distance parameter. The expression for <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> is a function of both <i>F</i><sub>trap</sub> and <i>F</i><sub>i</sub>, and accounts for the roles of both internal and external tension in enhancing the dissociation of the rear head. A previously described analytical method was adopted to derive the expression for velocity as a function of force based on this model (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chemla et al., 2008</a>).

Because the NL-insert mutants exhibited indistinguishable force-dependent velocities, we took the inter-head tension in these constructs to be negligible compared to the WT (<i>F</i><sub>i,mutant</sub> <i>\u2248</i> 0 pN). With this assumption, we determined the inter-head tension in WT kinesin (<i>F</i><sub>i,WT</sub>) to be 26 \u00b1 3 pN in the 2-HB state, a value that agrees well with molecular dynamics simulations, which predicted that it would lie in the range of 15\u201335 pN (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hariharan and Hancock, 2009</a>). The model fit also supplies an estimate of the unloaded rate of rear-head release, 260 \u00b1 10 s<sup>\u22121</sup>. With the derived values for <i>F</i><sub>i,WT</sub> and the load-dependence of rear-head unbinding, \u03b4<sub>3</sub>, the expression for <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> shows that inter-head tension alone is capable of increasing the rate of rear-head release by an order of magnitude (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Moreover, the modeled rate of ATP hydrolysis (plus the other primarily biochemical events, above), 95 \u00b1 1 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, is consistent with previous estimates of the hydrolysis rate from both biochemical and single-molecule studies (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ma and Taylor, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gilbert et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schnitzer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Farrell et al., 2002</a>).

Previous work has shown that the main force-dependent transition occurs from a 1-HB state after ATP binding (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schnitzer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Block et al., 2003</a>). The velocity decrease under hindering loads is associated with this transition, which we model as <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>, with a correspondingly large distance parameter (\u03b4<sub>1</sub> \u2265 4 nm; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), equivalent to nearly half the size of the kinesin step. This transition becomes rate limiting at moderate hindering loads, and will therefore dominate any other possible force-dependent steps at high loads. Under assisting loads, <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> is exceedingly fast (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) and does not appreciably contribute to the completion time of the overall cycle\u2014and therefore to the velocity\u2014in this regime. However, for the mutant constructs, we are able to detect a second force-dependent contribution that is manifested as increased velocity under assisting loads (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This force dependence, \u03b4<sub>3</sub>, is necessarily linked to some motion of the motor, and the load dependence of the associated rate, <i>k</i><sub>3</sub>, could be attributed either to rear head release when kinesin is in the 2-HB state or to binding of the forward-positioned tethered head of a 1-HB motor. We strongly favor the former possibility, because it also helps to explain the observed decrease in run length under assisting load, as well as the force dependence of exponential fits to the run length data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Put another way, if load-dependent rate <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> was instead to correspond to tethered-head binding, then an increase in <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> under assisting load would increase the likelihood of completing a step, and thereby increase run lengths in this force regime, contrary to observation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). With these assignments, <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> remains the sole force-independent rate, corresponding primarily to biochemical, and not mechanical, events."

Having determined values for the inter-head tension and the force-dependent rate of rear-head release (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), it is also necessary to quantify the force-dependent rate of front-head release in order to model how inter-head tension affects the unbinding gate. The application of hindering loads to the kinesin stalk places a rearward load on its front head, and therefore can serve as a proxy for estimating the rate of detachment of the front head at the unbinding gate. Previously, we showed that large superstall forces imposed by an optical trap (exceeding \u22127 pN) slow down the forward stepping pathway to such an extent that unbinding proceeds through a competing (slow) ATP-dependent pathway (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>). To quantify the rate of front-head detachment, we examined the unbinding of DmK-WT from the MT under load in the presence of saturating levels of ATP (2 mM).

Evidently, the binding gate is substantially more effective at maintaining processivity under unloaded or hindering-force conditions than under assisting-load conditions. Assisting loads as low as 2 pN produced a dramatic reduction in the run length, suggesting that any mechanism responsible for the binding gate becomes ineffective when kinesin is subjected to forces aligned with its overall motion.

Enlarging that space extends the time that the tethered head takes to reach the forward site, thereby increasing the probability that the partner head may release the MT prematurely, enhancing dimer dissociation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This proposal is also consistent with the effect of added P<sub>i</sub> in increasing the processivity of DmK-WT and DmK-6AA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>): P<sub>i</sub> acts to stabilize the bound head, thereby reducing dimer dissociation. The finding that normalized run lengths for the NL constructs were identical under all conditions tested (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) suggests that the rates of any biochemical events associated with the bound head, when the kinesin cycle is at the binding gate, are independent of the NL length.

We surmise that inserting a single AA into the NL introduces sufficient slack into the inter-head linkage that any further extensions become superfluous. A relatively high inter-head tension (26 \u00b1 3 pN; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) may be advantageous in tuning WT kinesin for increased velocity. However, because constructs with up to 6 AA inserted in the NL retained significant functionality (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), we infer that inter-head tension plays only a modulatory role in kinesin motility, a conclusion that gains support from the modeled force\u2013velocity relations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The fit parameters indicate that WT levels of inter-head tension can amplify the rate of rear-head release by an order of magnitude beyond its unloaded rate. However, because this unloaded rate is already more than double the rate of the hydrolysis-associated events of the kinesin cycle, <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>, the rate-determining step of the full cycle cannot be rear-head release. We find instead that the 2-HB state of kinesin is primarily <i>front-head gated</i>, in the sense that the kinetic cycle of the front head is slowed while the rear head remains MT-bound. Put another way, the gating mechanism responsible for processivity in the 2-HB state does not require inter-head tension, but rather occurs through a modulation of the rates of biochemical processes occurring at the front head, including ATP hydrolysis, and possibly productive ATP binding (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>)."

This conclusion seemingly runs contrary to previous publications, implicating inter-head tension as the preferred gating mechanism (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Guydosh and Block, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Toprak et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Shastry and Hancock, 2011</a>). However, as we have previously argued (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>), results from the earlier studies can be reconciled with our own by invoking a front-head gating mechanism for kinesin where it is the <i>spatial orientation</i> of the NL (i.e., pointing forward in the docked state and rearward when undocked), rather than inter-head tension, per se, that facilitates coordination of biochemical states, as discussed (<a href=\"#bib3\">Asenjo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hahlen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>). In WT kinesin, an essential difference between the 2-HB state [C] and the 1-HB state with the tethered head positioned in front of the bound head [B] (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) is that inter-head tension can develop only when both heads are strongly bound. Although tension may accelerate the rear-head release, no increase in this rate is necessary for gating, so long as the biochemical events in the front head of a 2-HB motor cannot proceed. In other words, gating at the 2-HB state may be accomplished not by accelerating rates associated with the rear head, but by inhibiting\u2014via the spatial orientation of the NL\u2014the ATP hydrolysis cycle at the front head, until the rear head detaches."

The reason for these differences is unclear, but we conjecture that it may be due to the presence of the positively charged lysine in the AEQKLT insert. In all constructs, NL extensions were introduced at the junction of NL and the stalk to minimize any disruption to the interaction between the remaining, native NL sequence and the catalytic head domain. It is conceivable that insertions at this position nevertheless affect kinesin in some ways beyond the reduction in tension arising from increased NL length, but we consider that possibility less likely, because the data in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2\u20125</a> can be well modeled by mechanical effects. We also favor the explanation that extensions of the NL lead to negligible inter-head strain in the 2-HB state, because extensions from 1 to 6 AA increase the NL length by over 30%, yet generate no corresponding change in velocity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

Because the rate of unbinding of the front head increases faster than that of the read head under increasing inter-head tension, the unbinding gate functions most efficiently at lower tension, or in its absence. Extensions of the NL abolished inter-head tension in kinesin, yet motors remained active, albeit at reduced speeds, and their stepping gates remained fully functional, suppressing rear-head rebinding even in constructs with NLs lengthened up to three AA. These considerations, taken on their own, suggest that NL extensions from 1 to 3 AA might lead to more effective gating, and consequently to greater processivity. Instead, the most pronounced effect of NL extension was a dramatic decrease in processivity. An explanation is that the dominant effect of lengthening the NL is to compromise the binding gate, and that the deleterious effect of NL length at this gate outweighs any compensating effects of reduced inter-head tension at the unbinding gate. We conclude that the key role played by NL length in kinesin gating is twofold: (1) to enhance processivity by facilitating binding of the tethered head to the forward MT site at the binding gate, and (2) to increase velocity by accelerating rear-head release from the 2-HB state at the unbinding gate."

One or more rounds of site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) were applied to produce a series of constructs with lengthened NL domains, extended by 1 (L; DmK-1AA), 2 (HV; DmK-2AA), 3 (DAL; DmK-3AA), 4 (LAST; DmK-4AA), 5 (LASQT; DmK-5AA), or 6 AA (LQASQT; DmK-6AA). A version of DmK-6AA with the NL insert AEQKLT was also generated. These insertions were all introduced at the junction of the NL and the coiled-coil stalk, between residues T344 and A345 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Shastry and Hancock, 2010</a>). The procedures for the expression of proteins in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and subsequent purification via nickel column chromatography were described previously (<a href=\"#bib69\">Uppalapati et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shastry and Hancock, 2010</a>). A C338S point mutant (DmK-C338S) and a CL (DmK-CL) version with 2 mutations (C45S and C338S) were generated from a <i>Drosophila</i> KHC truncated at residue 401, with a C-terminal 6xHis-tag (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fehr et al., 2009</a>). These mutants were expressed and purified as described (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fehr et al., 2009</a>). A round of site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce DmK-C338S, based on the DmK-CL construct. Human non-CL kinesin-1 motors were based on a truncated construct (HsK-WT) containing the first 595 residues of KIF5B (<a href=\"#bib49\">Navone et al., 1992</a>), with a C-terminal 6xHis-tag. The expression plasmid for HsK-WT (pAF4) was created by replacing the sequence coding for a truncated <i>Drosophila</i> kinesin-1 in plasmid pCA1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asbury et al., 2003</a>) with one corresponding to the first 595 residues of KIF5B, via cassette mutagenesis. Multiple rounds of site-directed mutagenesis were used to generate two constructs with 6 AA inserted into the NL region (LQASQT and AEQKLT; HsK-6AA). The inserted residues were positioned at the junction of the NL and common coiled-coil stalk, between residues T336 and A337, respectively. The non-CL human constructs were expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and purified on a nickel column, as described (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fehr et al., 2009</a>). A truncated CL human kinesin-1 construct (HsK-CL) containing the first 560 residues of the motor domain and 7 mutations (C7S, C65A, C168A, C174S, C294A, C330S, C421A) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rice et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Rosenfeld et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clancy et al., 2011</a>) was also used in our motility experiments (a gift of S Rosenfeld, Cleveland Clinic)."

With all respect, we cited the <a href=\"#bib78\">Yildiz et al. 2008</a> paper four times (and not \u201conly once\u201d) in our original manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we now cite it eight times. We also note that we cited three papers by Asenjo et al., one of which (Asenjo et al., Nat. Struct. Biol., 2003) is used to support the notion that kinesin is gated by the spatial orientation of the neck linker. As the reviewers correctly note, the 2008 study by Yildiz and coworkers adopted a similar strategy, probing gating through the use of kinesin constructs with extended neck linkers. A central conclusion by <a href=\"#bib78\">Yildiz et al. (2008)</a>, along with related work (Yildiz et al., Science, 2004), is that the ATP-waiting state of the kinesin dimer is a two-heads-bound state (2-HB). However, at least three subsequent publications, only one of which was published by my group, have argued that this conclusion is erroneous, and that the ATP-waiting state is, in fact, a one-head-bound state (1-HB) instead (Asenjo and Sosa, PNAS, 2009; Guydosh and Block, Nature, 2009; Toprak et al<i>., PNAS,</i> 2009). The discrepancy in conclusions here might be attributable to the cysteine-light constructs employed by Yildiz et al<i>.</i>, just as the reviewers implies. However, it may equally well be due to their use of non-physiological, low-salt conditions that are known to enhance electrostatic interactions between the rear head of kinesin and the microtubule, as previously suggested by Shastry and Hancock (Curr. Biol., 2010). We recognize that the three papers that we cited from the Sosa group (Asenjo et al., Nat. Struct. Biol., 2003; Asenjo et al., Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol., 2006; Asenjo and Sosa, PNAS, 2009) also used similar constructs and buffer conditions as the fluorescence experiments of Yildiz and coworkers. However, unlike Yildiz et al<i>.</i>, the fluorescence polarization measurements carried out by Sosa et al<i>.</i> allowed them to disambiguate the 2-HB state, where the rear head is bound to the microtubule, from the 1-HB state, where the rear head may, on average, be situated near the microtubule without being bound to it."

Clearly, kinesin molecules do not operate in cells under such extremes. Some labs have resorted to using low-<i>Z</i> buffers because these greatly increase kinesin processivity (by electrostatically preventing kinesin-microtubule dissociation), resulting in longer run lengths that are more conveniently measured. However, there is a concern that this is artifactual. We agree that understanding the salient differences among the various study conditions is important, but we feel that a detailed digression on these issues in our own manuscript would (1) require too much space and (2) detract from our main point, which is the presentation of a general framework for gating. This is a topic that would be better dealt with in a critical review of the field, where such comparisons are more appropriate."

In the 2-HB state, it\u2019s a competition between the unbinding of the rear head vs. unbinding of the front head. In this case, although tension is certainly present in the 2-HB state for wild-type kinesin, it is the inhibition of the front head, and not the acceleration of rear-head release, that supplies the strong bias for rear-head detachment, leading to forward stepping. In the 2-HB state, it is the orientation of the NL, rather than any inter-head tension, that primarily leads to unidirectional motion along the microtubule. These are two of the key conclusions of our study, in fact. These conclusions are supported strongly by the data we present here, and they are further corroborated by evidence previously published by my group, as well as several others (which we cite). However, our conclusions do run contrary to other published findings, particularly those of the Vale and Yildiz groups (which we also cite). That said, we feel that the quality (and extent) of our data speaks for itself, and is more persuasive.
