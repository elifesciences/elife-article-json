Using five autism-related mouse models, <i>Shank3+</i>/\u0394C, <i>Mecp2</i><sup>R308/Y</sup>, <i>Cntnap2</i>-/-, L7-Tsc1 (<i>L7/Pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>::Tsc1<sup>flox/</sup></i>+) and patDp(15q11-13)/+, we report specific perturbations in delay eyeblink conditioning, a form of associative sensory learning requiring cerebellar plasticity. By distinguishing perturbations in the probability and characteristics of learned responses, we found that probability was reduced in <i>Cntnap2</i>-/-, patDp(15q11-13)/+, and <i>L7/Pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>::Tsc1<sup>flox/</sup></i>+, all associated with Purkinje-cell/deep-nuclear gene expression, along with <i>Shank3</i>+/\u0394C. Amplitudes were smaller in <i>L7/Pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>::Tsc1<sup>flox/</sup></i>+ as well as <i>Shank3</i>+/\u0394C and <i>Mecp2</i><sup>R308/Y</sup>, which are associated with granule-cell pathway expression. <i>Shank3+</i>/\u0394C and <i>Mecp2</i><sup>R308/Y</sup> also showed aberrant response timing and reduced Purkinje-cell dendritic spine density. Overall, our observations are potentially accounted for by defects in instructed learning in the olivocerebellar loop and response representation in the granule cell pathway. Our findings indicate that defects in associative temporal binding of sensory events are widespread in autism mouse models."
