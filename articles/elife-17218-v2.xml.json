How BM sliding is controlled, however, is poorly understood. Using genetic and live cell imaging approaches during uterine-vulval attachment in <i>C. elegans</i>, we have discovered that the invasive uterine anchor cell activates Notch signaling in neighboring uterine cells at the boundary of the BM gap through which it invades to promote BM sliding. Through an RNAi screen, we found that Notch activation upregulates expression of <i>ctg-1</i>, which encodes a Sec14-GOLD protein, a member of the Sec14 phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein superfamily that is implicated in vesicle trafficking. Through photobleaching, targeted knockdown, and cell-specific rescue, our results suggest that CTG-1 restricts BM adhesion receptor DGN-1 (dystroglycan) trafficking to the cell-BM interface, which promotes BM sliding. Together, these studies reveal a new morphogenetic signaling pathway that controls BM sliding to remodel tissues."

How BM sliding is controlled, however, is poorly understood. Using genetic and live cell imaging approaches during uterine-vulval attachment in <i>C. elegans</i>, we have discovered that the invasive uterine anchor cell activates Notch signaling in neighboring uterine cells at the boundary of the BM gap through which it invades to promote BM sliding. Through an RNAi screen, we found that Notch activation upregulates expression of <i>ctg-1</i>, which encodes a Sec14-GOLD protein, a member of the Sec14 phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein superfamily that is implicated in vesicle trafficking. Through photobleaching, targeted knockdown, and cell-specific rescue, our results suggest that CTG-1 restricts BM adhesion receptor DGN-1 (dystroglycan) trafficking to the cell-BM interface, which promotes BM sliding. Together, these studies reveal a new morphogenetic signaling pathway that controls BM sliding to remodel tissues."

These membranes separate and help shape tissues, while protecting them from mechanical damage such as stretching. However, despite serving as important barriers, basement membranes must be rapidly removed at specific times and places to allow tissues to grow and change shape. This process also permits cells to enter and leave tissues, such as immune cells when they search for disease-producing agents. This creates a paradox: how does a tissue create a tough, impassable barrier that can also be rapidly removed at specific times and places?"

One of the most dramatic examples of this mobility is cell-BM sliding, during which epithelial cell layers and their underlying BM sheets move (slide) along one another independently to regulate tissue remodeling or renewal. Examples of cell-BM sliding are varied and include egg chamber rotation in <i>Drosophila</i>, where the follicle cells move along BM and deposit constricting strips of aligned type IV collagen, which direct egg elongation along the anterior-posterior axis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cetera and Horne-Badovinac, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</a>). During salivary gland growth in vertebrates, the BM slides away from the bud tip toward the duct, allowing bud expansion while restricting growth at the duct (<a href=\"#bib37\">Harunaga et al., 2014</a>). Further, BM labeling and pulse chase experiments revealed that intestinal epithelial cells derived from the stem cell crypt slide along the BM towards the villus tips during differentiation to rapidly renew the gut epithelium (<a href=\"#bib15\">Clevers, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Trier et al., 1990</a>). Cell-BM sliding may be a common morphogenetic process that regulates organ shaping during development, tissue homeostasis, and diseases such as cancer, where remodeling of cell-BM interfaces frequently occur (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kelley et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Rowe and Weiss, 2008</a>).

During the mid-L3 larval stage, the uterine-vulval connection is initiated by a specialized uterine cell, the anchor cell (AC), that breaches the BM that separate these tissues and attaches to the underlying vulval cells. Following AC invasion, the gap in the BM widens further, which allows additional connection between uterine and vulval cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ihara et al., 2011</a>). BM gap widening does not involve BM degradation. Instead, optical highlighting of BM and manipulation of tissue dynamics has shown that growth and morphogenesis of the uterine and vulval tissues generate forces on the BM that drive BM sliding over the vulval and uterine cells to further expand the gap (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ihara et al., 2011</a>). The vulval cells have a key role in controlling the extent of BM movement. The centrally located vulval E and F cells, which contact the BM gap boundary, undergo precisely timed divisions to initiate BM sliding--cell rounding during divisions dramatically reduces cell contact with the BM and allows the BM to slide over the vulE and F cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Matus et al., 2014</a>). The BM stops sliding on the non-dividing vulD cell, which concentrates the BM adhesion receptor INA-1/PAT-3 (integrin) to stabilize the BM gap boundary (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ihara et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Matus et al., 2014</a>).

Through this screen we identified a putative null mutant in the gene encoding the LIN-29 protein, which is a Kruppel-family EGR (early growth response) protein (<a href=\"#bib36\">Harris and Horvitz, 2011</a>), that is deficient in BM sliding. We show that LIN-29 is expressed and functions in the invading AC to promote BM sliding. We further find that LIN-29 regulates BM sliding through its role in maintaining AC expression of LAG-2, a transmembrane Notch ligand, which activates Notch signaling in the neighboring BM gap boundary cells, the uterine \u03c0 cells that sit on BM next to the nascent breach. Through a targeted uterine-specific RNAi screen of putative direct Notch targets, we find that Notch activation in these uterine cells upregulates <i>ctg-1</i> expression, which encodes a Sec14-GOLD domain phosphatidylinositol transfer protein that belongs to a class of proteins implicated in regulating vesicle trafficking (<a href=\"#bib28\">Grabon et al., 2015</a>). Finally, using photobleaching, CRISPR/Cas-9 targeted knockout, and cell-specific rescue experiments, we demonstrate that CTG-1 functions in the uterine \u03c0 cells to limit the cell surface trafficking of DGN-1 (dystroglycan), and that reduction of DGN-1 is sufficient to promote BM sliding. Together these studies identify a new morphogenetic pathway\u2014from signaling mechanism to effector\u2014that promotes BM sliding, which can be used by invasive cells to enlarge BM openings and allow the direct interaction of cells between tissues."

AC invasion and BM remodeling occur in tight coordination with vulval development and can be staged according to the centrally located 1\u00b0 fated P6.p vulval precursor cell (VPC) divisions. During invasion (P6.p 2 and 4-cell stages) the gonadal and ventral BMs are breached and fuse at the edges of the invading AC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">Ihara et al., 2011</a>). Following AC invasion, the vulval cells grow, invaginate, and divide (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ihara et al., 2011</a>). The rapid expansion and invagination of the vulval cells generate forces on the BM that promote expansion of the nascent BM opening through BM sliding over the vulval and uterine cells that sit at the boundary of the BM gap. Expansion of the BM gap allows direct contact between the cells that mediate uterine-vulval attachment (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ihara et al., 2011</a>). Precisely timed divisions of the BM gap boundary vulval P6.p descendants (the vulE and vulF cells) during the late L3 stage reduce BM adhesion, allowing the BM to slide over these dividing vulval cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Matus et al., 2014</a>). The BM gap halts its expansion over the non-dividing vulD cells during the early L4 stage (P6.p 8-cell stage); the vulD cells further stabilize the BM gap boundary by upregulating the integrin heterodimer INA-1/PAT-3 and the adhesion regulator VAB-19 (the worm ortholog of Kank) (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">Ihara et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Matus et al., 2014</a>). The ventral uterine (VU) cells neighboring the AC are also initially in contact with the BM. During the time of AC invasion, the adjacent six VU cells are specified to adopt a \u03c0 fate through LAG-2/LIN-12 (Notch) signaling by the AC. During BM sliding the uterine \u03c0 cells undergo one round of division (<a href=\"#bib59\">Newman, 1995</a>).

To quantify the BM gap defect, we measured the diameter of the BM gap at the early L4 (P6.p 8-cell stage) in the plane where the AC is in focus in wild type and <i>qy1</i> worms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The gap in the BM was significantly reduced in <i>qy1</i> mutant animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Further, we found that that while in wild type animals, the BM moved away from both the anterior and posterior sides of the AC in most animals (n = 13/20 animals; the remaining 7 moved on one side), in <i>qy1</i> animals the BM never moved away from both sides of the AC (n = 0/20 animals) and only occasionally moved slightly away from one side (n = 5/20 animals)."

To differentiate between these possibilities we directly examined BM sliding by performing optical highlighting experiments using transgenic animals expressing laminin tagged with the photoconvertible fluorophore Dendra (laminin::Dendra; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">Ihara et al., 2011</a>). Dendra is a stable, photoconvertible fluorescent protein that irreversibly switches from green to red following exposure to short wavelength light (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gurskaya et al., 2006</a>). Segments of the BM adjacent to the invading AC were photoconverted at the P6.p 4-cell stage and imaged at the P6.p 8-cell stage. While marked edges of the BM gap moved away from the AC and rested over the vulD cell in wild type animals (n = 10/10 animals), optically highlighted segments maintained contact with the AC in <i>lin-29(qy1)</i> mutants and failed to move over the vulD cell (n = 18/18 animals; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). These observations indicate that the BM in <i>lin-29</i> mutant animals fails to slide away from the AC and excludes additional BM deposition as a mechanism for the defect. Notably, the morphology of the developing vulva\u2014including the number of VPCs and their relative positions (n = 15/15 animals, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and vulval height and width (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)\u2014was the same in <i>lin-29(qy1)</i> mutants compared with wild type animals. Taken together, these results indicate that <i>lin-29</i> mutants have a specific defect in BM sliding that is independent of the role of the vulval cell divisions in controlling BM movement (<a href=\"#bib50\">Matus et al., 2014</a>)."

During the early L3 stage (just prior to the time of AC invasion), LIN-29 is required in the AC to specify the \u03c0 cell fate in the six ventral uterine cell descendants that directly neighbor the AC (<a href=\"#bib60\">Newman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Newman, 1995</a>). LIN-29 maintains the expression of the transmembrane Notch ligand LAG-2 in the AC, which activates LIN-12 in the neighboring ventral uterine cells and specifies the \u03c0 cell fate (<a href=\"#bib60\">Newman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Newman, 1995</a>).

Uterine-specific RNAi was attained with uterine-specific expression of the Argonaute/PIWI gene <i>rde-1</i> in an <i>rde-1</i> mutant background, which restores RNAi only in the uterine tissue (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hagedorn et al., 2009</a>). Uterine <i>lag-2</i> knockdown recapitulated the BM sliding defect seen in <i>lin-29</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), suggesting that the LIN-29 protein acts in a LAG-2 dependent manner to promote BM sliding. Notably, the reduction in BM gap opening after <i>lag-2</i> RNAi was less than in <i>lin-29</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> versus <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), which was likely due to the incomplete loss of <i>lag-2</i> by RNAi. Consistent with LAG-2 acting through the LIN-12 (Notch) receptor, we also used RNAi targeting <i>lin-12</i> and <i>glp-1</i> (the only other encoded Notch receptor in the <i>C. elegans</i> genome)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib29\">Greenwald, 2005</a>) and found that loss of <i>lin-12</i>, but not <i>glp-1</i>, phenocopied <i>lag-2</i> RNAi (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Finally, we assessed gap expansion in mutants that lacked the ability to transduce Notch signaling in the \u03c0 cells (<i>sel-12(ty11)</i>). SEL-12 is a <i>C. elegans</i> presenilin that cleaves ligand bound LIN-12 (Notch) so that the intracellular domain is released to translocate to the nucleus and activate target gene expression. No other <i>C. elegans</i> presenilins act in the prospective \u03c0 cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cinar et al., 2001</a>), so loss of <i>sel-12</i> specifically targets \u03c0 cell specification and circumvents other phenotypes associated with the absence of Notch signaling. Loss of <i>sel-12</i> led to a similar defect in BM gap expansion as <i>lin-29</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). These observations offer strong evidence that LIN-29 in the AC regulates BM sliding by specifying ventral uterine descendents adjacent to the BM gap boundary to adopt the \u03c0 cell fate."

To test this notion, we ablated the precursors of the \u03c0 cells (ventral uterine cells) on one side of the AC in <i>lin-29(qy1)</i> mutants. We found that this treatment rescued the BM sliding defect on that side (n = 5/8 animals, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

During LIN-12/Notch activation, the intracellular domain of LIN-12/Notch is cleaved and enters the nucleus where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein LAG-1 (the worm ortholog of CSL) that promotes expression of LIN-12/Notch target genes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Greenwald, 2012</a>). Bioinformatic studies have previously identified 163 putative direct targets of LIN-12/Notch that contain clusters of LAG-1 binding sites (<a href=\"#bib85\">Yoo, 2004</a>). We conducted an RNAi screen of 104 of the 163 presumptive Notch targets to assess BM gap opening. Worms were scored as having a small BM gap diameter if the BM remained in contact with the AC or vulF cells at the P6.p 8-cell stage\u2014a time when the BM stabilizes over vulD in control animals. Through this screen, we found that RNAi-mediated knock down of <i>ctg-1</i>, which encodes a Sec14-GOLD protein, a poorly understood group of the Sec14 family of phospholipid transfer proteins (<a href=\"#bib55\">Mousley et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Saito et al., 2007</a>), led to a similar BM sliding defect as knock down of the LIN-12/Notch ligand <i>lag-2</i> (<a href=\"#SD22-data\">Supplementary\u00a0file\u00a01</a>). Furthermore, we found that RNAi-mediated knock down of <i>ctg-1</i> expression in a uterine-specific RNAi strain also resulted in a BM sliding defect and smaller BM opening (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). These results are consistent with the possibility that <i>ctg-1</i> is a primary target of LIN-12/Notch signaling in the \u03c0 cells and mediates BM sliding."

To determine if <i>ctg-1</i> is upregulated in the \u03c0 cells, we created a transcriptional reporter for <i>ctg-1</i> by replacing the majority of the coding region with GFP using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <i>ctg-1 &gt; GFP; qy11</i> allele) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dickinson et al., 2013</a>). Strikingly, we found <i>ctg-1 &gt; GFP</i> was specifically upregulated in the \u03c0 cells during the time of BM sliding in wild type animals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), but not <i>lin-29</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Furthermore, as this GFP insertion created a <i>ctg-1</i> loss of function mutation, we examined BM sliding in <i>qy11</i> worms and confirmed that genetic loss of <i>ctg-1</i> led to a\u00a0reduction in BM sliding and gap opening (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). To assess whether restoration of CTG-1 in the ventral uterine cells in a <i>lin-29</i> mutant could restore BM sliding, we expressed a full-length GFP translational fusion of <i>ctg-1</i> under the control of a pan-uterine promoter (<i>fos-1 &gt; ctg-1::GFP</i>) in <i>lin-29</i> mutant animals. CTG-1::GFP predominantly localized to the cytosol of the uterine cells (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), consistent with reports of Sec14 family protein localization in yeast, plant and mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schnabl et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Shibata et al., 2001</a>). Restoration of uterine expression of CTG-1::GFP in <i>lin-29</i> mutants rescued BM sliding and gap opening (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>). Taken together, these results offer compelling evidence that <i>ctg-1</i> is a direct and crucial transcriptional target of LIN-29-mediated LIN-12/Notch signaling in the \u03c0 cells that promotes BM sliding."

Six Sec14 family proteins are encoded in the <i>S. cerevisae</i> genome and more than 20 exist in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bankaitis et al., 2010</a>). We found that at least 16 Sec14 family members are encoded in the <i>C. elegans</i> genome (<a href=\"#SD23-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), with 12 encoding Sec14-GOLD proteins. Evidence suggests that Sec14 family proteins act as site-specific catalysts of phosphatidylinositol 4-OH kinases that generate phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bankaitis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Huang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Schaaf et al., 2008</a>). Many Sec14 family proteins are thought to regulate vesicular trafficking, yet very little is known about the precise cellular processes controlled by most of these proteins (<a href=\"#bib18\">Curwin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Grabon et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">LeBlanc and McMaster, 2010</a>). In <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Sec14 regulates trafficking through the PI4-kinase Pik1. To determine whether CTG-1 might regulate BM sliding through a PI4-kinase, we examined uterine-cell specific RNAi-mediated knockdown of the four PI4-kinases encoded in the <i>C. elegans</i> genome. We also examined knockdown of the sole <i>C. elegans</i> PI5-kinase, <i>ppk-1</i>, which uses PI(4)P to generate PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib84\">Weinkove et al., 2008</a>). In support of a similar role for CTG-1 as Sec14, we found that reduction of <i>pifk-1</i>(ortholog of Pik1 and vertebrate PI4KIII\u03b2), but not other PI4-kinases or <i>ppk-1</i>, decreased BM sliding and gap expansion (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). As Sec14 and Pik1/ PI4KIII\u03b2 are implicated as regulators of vesicle trafficking (<a href=\"#bib14\">Clayton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Sciorra et al., 2005</a>), we hypothesized that <i>ctg-1</i> might be upregulated in the \u03c0 cells to alter the trafficking and localization of BM adhesion receptor proteins to promote BM sliding."

All integrins are heterodimers composed of a single \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunit. <i>C. elegans</i> have two heterodimers, composed of \u03b1PAT-2 or \u03b1INA-1 subunit bound to the sole \u03b2 subunit, PAT-3 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kramer, 2005</a>). Only the INA-1/PAT-3 heterodimer is expressed in uterine and vulval tissue at the time of uterine-vulval attachment. INA-1/PAT-3 integrin is necessary for the stabilization of the BM over vulD and its loss results in the Pvl phenotype (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hagedorn et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ihara et al., 2011</a>). We did not, however, find any changes in the expression or localization of the functional integrin reporter PAT-3::GFP (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hagedorn et al., 2009</a>) in the <i>lin-29(qy1)</i> mutant background, which lacks <i>ctg-1</i> expression, compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments indicated that PAT-3::GFP was trafficked to the cell-BM interface normally at the time of BM sliding (between P6.p 4-cell and 8-cell stages) in <i>lin-29</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Finally, RNAi-mediated targeting of <i>ina-1</i> in the uterine-specific RNAi background did not rescue BM sliding in <i>lin-29</i> mutants (BM gap diameter 8.13 \u00b1 0.16\u2009\u03bcm (L4440 empty vector control, n = 48), 8.30 \u00b1 0.25\u2009\u03bcm [<i>ina-1</i> RNAi, n = 48]).

DGN-1 is expressed in the uterine tissue and, like integrin, its loss results in a Pvl phenotype, indicating potential functions in uterine-vulval attachment (<a href=\"#bib44\">Johnson et al., 2006</a>). We detected a significant increase in the localization of DGN-1 at the cell-BM interface in the \u03c0 cells of <i>lin-29</i> mutants compared to wild type animals (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). This difference was not a result of increased expression, as the transcriptional reporter for <i>dgn-1</i> was similarly expressed in <i>lin-29</i> mutants and wild type (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). In addition, the localization of DGN-1 in regions beyond the edges of the BM gap (over the vulD cell) were similar in <i>lin-29</i> and wild type, indicating that the alteration in DGN-1 localization was specific to the region of BM sliding near the AC (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). FRAP experiments indicated that DGN-1 recovered more quickly after photobleaching in <i>lin-29</i> mutants versus wild type animals, which may account for the increased DGN-1::GFP localization (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F,G</a>). Faster recovery of DGN-1 at the cell-BM interface in <i>lin-29</i> mutants could indicate more rapid cell surface trafficking, slower endocytosis/removal, or faster lateral plasma membrane mobility. Notably, the number of DGN-1 containing Rab-7 marked late endosome vesicles in <i>lin-29</i> mutants and wild type animals was similar, suggesting that CTG-1 might not direct rapid removal of DGN-1 from the cell surface into the endosomal system (<a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). There was, however, a reduction of F-actin at the basal surface in the \u03c0 cells in <i>lin-29</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig8s4\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). As F-actin is thought to act as a barrier to exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Eitzen, 2003</a>), these observations support the idea of increased DGN-1 delivery to the cell surface. Given the association of the GOLD domain, Sec14 proteins, and PI4-kinase regulation with vesicle trafficking, (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Clayton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mousley et al., 2007</a>), CTG-1 may direct a specific trafficking pathway that restricts the delivery of DGN-1 to the cell-BM interface. Importantly, these observations do not rule out the possibility that CTG-1 enhances endocytic removal from the cell surface at levels that we were unable to detect or that it regulates the membrane mobility of DGN-1 to limit DGN-1 at the cell-BM interface."

How BM sliding is controlled, however, remains poorly understood. We show here that the AC in <i>C. elegans</i> further widens a breach it creates in BM during uterine-vulval attachment by promoting BM sliding in neighboring uterine cells. LIN-29 maintains the expression of the Notch ligand LAG-2 in the AC, which leads to the activation of Notch signaling and induction of uterine \u03c0 cell fate in the neighboring cells that sit over the nascent BM gap boundary. Notch activation in turn leads to upregulation of the Sec14 family phospholipid transfer protein CTG-1 in these BM gap boundary cells, which restricts trafficking of the receptor DGN-1 (dystroglycan) to the cell-BM interace. Our data suggest that the proper regulation of DGN-1 trafficking modulates cell-BM adhesion and allows the BM slide, which further widens the BM breach. This work reveals a new morphogenetic signaling pathway that promotes cell-BM sliding (See Summary <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

During vulval invagination and growth, the centrally located vulE and F cells divide and reduce their contact with the BM during cell rounding, allowing the BM to slide over these cells. The BM ultimately ceases sliding and the BM gap boundary stabilizes on the non-dividing vulD cell. Blocking the divisions of vulE and F halts BM sliding prematurely resulting in a narrower BM gap, while inducing vulD divisions causes the BM to slide further and enlarges the opening (<a href=\"#bib50\">Matus et al., 2014</a>). Here we have found that uterine cells at the BM gap boundary regulate BM movement through a distinct mechanism independent of cell division. Uterine \u03c0 cell divisions are not coordinated with vulval cell divisions during BM movement. Further, blocking uterine \u03c0 cell divisions did not halt BM sliding. Instead, through a forward genetic screen, site of action, and expression studies, our data indicate that the invading AC directs a morphogenetic signaling program that promotes BM sliding in neighboring uterine cells: (1) the AC expresses the transcription factor LIN-29, (2) LIN-29 activates Notch signaling and induction of the \u03c0 cell fate in neighboring uterine cells (<a href=\"#bib60\">Newman et al., 2000</a>), (3) as a part of \u03c0 cell fate induction, Notch activation upregulates <i>ctg-1,</i> which restricts trafficking of the BM adhesion receptor DGN-1 (dystroglycan) to the cell-BM interface and allows BM sliding. Together, these observations suggest that after AC invasion, the uterine \u03c0 cells loosen BM adhesion, allowing the BM to slide along the \u03c0 cells to a precise site determined by the dividing vulE and F cells and non-dividing vulD. This model is supported by the observed flexibility of BM boundary position, which can be adjusted by manipulating vulval cell divisions. The distinct, but temporally coordinated, mechanisms controlling BM movement in the uterine and vulval cells precisely position the BM gap boundary to ensure robust uterine-vulval attachment."

Using a focused RNAi screen we found that <i>ctg-1</i>, which encodes a Sec14 family phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein (PITP) (<a href=\"#bib83\">Tripathi et al., 2014</a>), is a crucial target of Notch signaling during \u03c0 cell fate specification that promotes BM sliding. Consistent with <i>ctg-1</i> being a direct transcriptional target of Notch, the <i>ctg-1</i> upstream regulatory region contains 19 predicted binding sites for the Notch transcriptional activator LAG-1 (Suppressor of Hairless) (<a href=\"#bib85\">Yoo, 2004</a>). Furthermore, <i>ctg-1</i> expression is upregulated in the \u03c0 cells at the time of activated LIN-12 (Notch) signaling, and its expression is dependent on LIN-29-directed Notch signaling. In addition, uterine-cell specific RNAi and genetic loss of <i>ctg-1</i> reduced BM sliding, which phenocopies loss of Notch signaling in these cells. Sec14 family PITPs are unlikely to be true carriers of phospholipids. Instead, studies suggest that Sec14 family PITPs function as scaffolds or nanoreactors that present phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase (PI4K) to regulate specific protein and membrane trafficking pathways in the trans-Golgi and endosomal recycling system (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cockcroft and Garner, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Curwin, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Curwin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mousley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Schaaf et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Tripathi et al., 2014</a>).

Whereas yeast have six Sec14 family members, we found <i>C. elegans</i> has at least 16 and vertebrates have at least 20 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bankaitis et al., 2010</a>). Little, however, is known about the cellular process controlled by many these proteins (<a href=\"#bib28\">Grabon et al., 2015</a>). Our work suggests that CTG-1 regulates the trafficking of DGN-1(dystroglycan) to the cell surface and promotes de-adhesion from BM to control BM sliding. Notably, localization and photobleaching studies indicate that the integrin heterodimer INA-1/PAT-3, another key BM receptor, was unaffected by loss of <i>ctg-1</i>, suggesting that CTG-1 function is highly specific. Loss of LIN-29-mediated Notch signaling (and thus <i>ctg-1</i> expression in the uterine cells) led to an increase of DGN-1 on the surface of uterine cells, but did not alter <i>dgn-1</i> gene expression. Photobleaching experiments in wild type and <i>lin-29</i> mutants (lack upregulation of <i>ctg-1</i>) indicated that <i>ctg-1</i> expression in the \u03c0 cells restricts the rate of DGN-1 trafficking to the cell-BM interface. Interestingly, in CTG-1 the Sec14 domain is paired with a GOLD (Golgi Dynamics) domain, which, though its function has yet to be completely characterized, may regulate the selection of proteins being trafficked from the Golgi, thus affecting their secretion to the plasma membrane or routing to the endosome-lysosomal system (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Schimmoller et al., 1995</a>). These results suggest that CTG-1 might reduce cell-BM adhesion by regulating a vesicular pathway with specificity for DGN-1, possibly slowing DGN-1 delivery to the cell surface or directing it to the endosome-lysosome system. The function of Sec14-GOLD proteins is poorly understood, and CTG-1 does not show strong localization to any specific domain in the uterine \u03c0 cells. Thus, we cannot rule out possible functions for CTG-1 in mediating increased removal of DGN-1 from the cell surface or slowing lateral plasma membrane trafficking to restrict DGN-1 at the cell-BM interface. While the specific mechanism by which CTG-1 restricts DGN-1 trafficking remains unclear, we found that reduction of DGN-1 restored BM sliding in the absence of <i>ctg-1,</i> strongly supporting the functional significance\u00a0of reduced localization and trafficking of DGN-1."

Unlike mammals, which construct 24 known \u03b1\u03b2 integrin heterodimers, <i>C. elegans</i> make only two, and only one of these, \u03b1INA-1/\u03b2PAT-3, is expressed with DGN-1 (dystroglycan) in the uterine \u03c0 cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hagedorn et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ihara et al., 2011</a>). Integrin and dystroglycan are co-expressed widely, and likely have many distinct roles, such as having opposing effects on extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ferletta et al., 2003</a>). However, how these proteins interact and coordinate functions in regulating cell-BM communication and adhesion has been challenging to elucidate as a result of tissue complexity and the large family of integrin heterodimers in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bello et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Nakaya et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, our data suggest that INA-1/PAT-3 is not downregulated to promote BM sliding in the uterine \u03c0 cells. Further, unlike loss of <i>dgn-1</i>, uterine-specific loss of <i>ina-1</i> did not rescue BM sliding in the <i>lin-29</i> mutant background. Our results indicate that DGN-1 is the primary BM adhesion receptor that controls cell-BM sliding in the uterine \u03c0 cells, while integrin appears to have a function(s) independent of BM sliding in these cells.

Notably, dystroglycan is also required for branching morphogenesis in glandular epithelium, a process that is thought to require BM sliding (<a href=\"#bib22\">Durbeej et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Harunaga et al., 2014</a>). Further, it has been shown that loss of basally localized dystroglycan during chick gastrulation promotes breakdown of BMs during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that forms mesoderm (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nakaya et al., 2011</a>). Thus, dystroglycan may have a fundamental role in mediating BM remodeling events during development. Importantly, loss or reduction of dystroglycan is also emerging as a common event in the progression of epithelial derived cancers, including breast, prostate, colon, cervical, and renal adenocarcinomas (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cross et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Esser et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sgambato et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib75\">2006</a>). As regulated loss or reduction of dystroglycan during development creates and widens BM gaps through BM loss and sliding, uncontrolled loss of dystroglyan during cancer progression may lead to the breakdown of BM barriers to facilitate tumor spread. Thus, understanding mechanisms that control dystroglycan levels at the cell surface are not only important in understanding tissue morphogenesis, but may provide new strategies to halt cancer progression."

To generate the transcriptional reporter for the <i>lin-29a/ b gene</i>, the 5\u2019 cis-regulatory element (5\u2019 CRE) 5.4 kb upstream of the ATG start codon of the <i>lin-29a/ b</i> gene was amplified. The 5\u2019 CRE sequence was then fused in frame to <i>GFP</i> coding sequence (PCR amplified from the vector pPD95.81) using PCR fusion. For the transcriptional reporter of the <i>lin-29c</i> gene, the 5\u2019 CRE 4.2 kb upstream of <i>lin-29c</i> coding sequence was PCR amplified and fused in frame to <i>GFP</i> coding sequence (PCR amplified from the vector pPD95.81) using PCR fusion. AC-specific <i>lin-29a::GFP</i> was generated by fusing <i>GFP</i> coding sequence with the amplicon <i>cdh-3 &gt; lin-29a</i> using PCR fusion. To generate the amplicon <i>cdh-3 &gt; lin-29a, lin-29b</i> cDNA was first PCR amplified and subcloned into the vector pPD95.81 containing the <i>cdh-3</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib78\">Sherwood et al., 2005</a>) at XhoI and HindIII sites. The coding sequence of <i>cdh-3 &gt; lin-29a</i> was PCR amplified from the vector <i>cdh-3 &gt; lin-29b</i> using the New England Laboratory site-directed-mutagenesis protocol with a primer containing a sequence encoding four <i>lin-29a</i> specific amino acids. To generate the <i>egl-13</i> &gt; <i>cki-1::GFP</i> construct, the 5 kb promoter region of <i>egl-13</i> was amplified from plasmid pWH17 and fused with to CKI-1::GFP amplified from the recombineered fosmid WRM0626bF02 (wTRG5.1_2491680425634929_G10). To generate the DGN-1 translational reporter, 2.6 kb upstream of the start codon to the end of the coding sequence of <i>dgn-1</i> was amplified from N2 genomic DNA and fused in frame to the GFP coding sequence amplified from vector pPD95.75, based on a previously published construct that rescues the sterility phenotype of <i>dgn-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Johnson et al., 2006</a>). To generate <i>fos-1</i> promoter containing constructs, pBlueScript containing the <i>fos-1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib78\">Sherwood et al., 2005</a>) was digested with ApaI and BamHI, then fused with the <i>ctg-1</i> coding sequence amplified from genomic DNA and the GFP coding sequence amplified from pPD95.75 for <i>fos-1 &gt; ctg-1::GFP,</i> the moesin::ABD coding sequence amplified from pJWZ6 for <i>fos-1 &gt; moesinABD::mCherry,</i> and the <i>rab-7::GFP</i> coding sequence amplified from pHD69 for <i>fos-1 &gt; rab-7::GFP</i>, using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning. Transgenic worms were created by co-injection of expression constructs with the transformation marker pPD#MM016B (<i>unc-119</i> ), or the co-injection marker (<i>myo-2 &gt; GFP</i>) or both into the germline of <i>unc-119(ed4)</i> mutants or wild type worms. These markers were injected with EcoRI-digested salmon sperm DNA and pBluescript II at 50 ng/\u00b5l as carrier DNA along with the expression constructs, which were normally injected at 10\u201350 ng/\u00b5l. Integrated strains were generated as described previously (<a href=\"#bib43\">Inoue et al., 2002</a>). To generate Y75B8A.24 RNAi, the first 800 bp of the coding sequence of the gene were amplified from genomic DNA and inserted into the vector L4440, which was digested with HindIII and KpnI."

The question is of general interest as tissue development and organogenesis relies on accurate control of the sliding of epithelial cells along BMs, yet little is known about how the sliding process is regulated. In this work, the authors systematically investigate the BM sliding process in the context of uterine-vulval attachment. The experiments described are logical, systematic and convincingly demonstrate that the invasive uterine AC communicates with neighboring uterine cells to activate a Notch signaling pathway whose major target in the pathway is a Sec14-GOLD protein of previously unknown function. FRAP data suggest that the Sec14-GOLD protein specifically and negatively regulates dystroglycan trafficking to the cell surface. It is modulation of the BM adhesion activity of the cell surface dystroglycan pool that regulates BM sliding at the BM gap boundary."

In particular examining and broadening the possible mechanisms by which CTG-1 might restrict dystroglycan levels and trafficking at the cell surface is important to explore and acknowledge. This is particularly important, as the functions of Sec14-GOLD proteins are poorly understood. We have now examined the co-localization of DGN-1 with Rab-7, a marker for the late endosome, and found no significant difference in the number of DGN-1 containing late endosomes. In addition, we have examined the localization of F-actin in the uterine \u03c0 cells and discovered that there is less F-actin in <i>lin-29</i> mutants (\u2013 <i>ctg-1</i>) at the cell-BM interface compared with wild type animals. As cortical F-actin is thought to generally act as a barrier to secretion (Eitzen G., (2003) Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1641:175\u2013 181), this observation is consistent with the idea that more DGN-1 may be delivered to the cell surface in <i>lin-29</i> mutants. However, reduced cortical F-actin might also promote more rapid lateral diffusion of DGN-1. Given the specificity of CTG-1 function in regulating DGN-1 trafficking (and not integrin) our data support the idea of a specific trafficking mechanism regulated by CTG-1 (either endocytosis, secretion or possibly lateral mobility). We have incorporated the new data into the manuscript and broadened our discussion on the possible function of CTG-1 in regulating DGN-1 trafficking as follows:"

This isolated puncta of BM is a small piece of BM that was internalized during AC invasion and not the boundary of the BM that has slid. AC invasion involves physical forces that move and break up this barrier (Hagedorn et al., (2013) Journal of Cell Biol., 10; 201(6): 903-13) resulting in small portions of BM that are internalized or remain outside of the AC after invasion.
