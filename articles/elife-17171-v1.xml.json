However, little is known regarding the potential components involved in the regulation of bimodal behavioral rhythms in mammals. Here, we identified that the zinc finger protein gene <i>Zbtb20</i> plays a crucial role in the regulation of bimodal activities in mice. Depletion of <i>Zbtb20</i> in nerve system resulted in the loss of early evening activity, but the increase of morning activity. We found that <i>Zbtb20</i>-deficient mice exhibited a pronounced decrease in the expression of <i>Prokr2</i> and resembled phenotypes of <i>Prok2</i> and <i>Prokr2</i>-knockout mice. Injection of adeno-associated virus-double-floxed <i>Prokr2</i> in suprachiasmatic nucleus could partly restore evening activity in <i>Nestin-Cre; Zbtb20</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> (NS-ZB20KO) mice. Furthermore, loss of <i>Zbtb20</i> in <i>Foxg1</i> loci, but intact in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, was not responsible for the unimodal activity of NS-ZB20KO mice. Our study provides evidence that ZBTB20-mediated PROKR2 signaling is critical for the evening behavioral rhythms."

However, little is known regarding the potential components involved in the regulation of bimodal behavioral rhythms in mammals. Here, we identified that the zinc finger protein gene <i>Zbtb20</i> plays a crucial role in the regulation of bimodal activities in mice. Depletion of <i>Zbtb20</i> in nerve system resulted in the loss of early evening activity, but the increase of morning activity. We found that <i>Zbtb20</i>-deficient mice exhibited a pronounced decrease in the expression of <i>Prokr2</i> and resembled phenotypes of <i>Prok2</i> and <i>Prokr2</i>-knockout mice. Injection of adeno-associated virus-double-floxed <i>Prokr2</i> in suprachiasmatic nucleus could partly restore evening activity in <i>Nestin-Cre; Zbtb20</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> (NS-ZB20KO) mice. Furthermore, loss of <i>Zbtb20</i> in <i>Foxg1</i> loci, but intact in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, was not responsible for the unimodal activity of NS-ZB20KO mice. Our study provides evidence that ZBTB20-mediated PROKR2 signaling is critical for the evening behavioral rhythms."

The rhythms originate from a central circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, and are synchronized to the environmental light-dark cycle via the retinohypothalamic tract (<a href=\"#bib41\">Morin and Allen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Reppert and Weaver, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Vansteensel et al., 2008</a>). At the molecular level, the rhythms are generated in a cell-autonomous manner by transcription\u2013translational-based feedback loops, which are composed of clock proteins, such as PERIOD (PER1, PER2, and PER3), CRYPTOCHROME (CRY1 and CRY2), CLOCK, BMAL1, NR1D1, NR1D2, and ROR (ROR\u03b1, RORb, and RORg) in mammals (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mohawk et al., 2012</a>). At the cellular level, the SCN is a heterogeneous structure consisting of multiple types of neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Antle and Silver, 2005</a>), which secretes more than 100 identified neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, cytokines, and growth factors (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abrahamson and Moore, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). Their coherence, in turn, imparts overt rhythms of activity-rest, physiology, and metabolism across the entire organism (<a href=\"#bib2\">An et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Herzog, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Maywood et al., 2006</a>)."

Prokineticin-2 (<i>Prok2</i>) is a clock-controlled gene, and PROK2 signaling via prokineticin receptor-2 (PROKR2) is a suprachiasmatic nuclei clock output signal that has been implicated in the redistribution of activity from early to late circadian night (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Prosser et al., 2007</a>). However, little is known regarding its regulation, which corresponds to evening and morning behavioral activities in mammals. Therefore, transcription factors that regulate the expression of <i>Prok2</i> or <i>Prokr2</i> signaling are necessary to expand the understanding of bimodal activity for entrainment and adaptation to seasonal changes in the environment."

Previous studies have indicated that ZBTB20 could be involved in metabolism, development, growth, glucose homeostasis, and immune responses (<a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ren et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sutherland et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Xie et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib69\">2012</a>). More importantly, missense mutations of ZBTB20 have been linked to Primrose syndrome (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cordeddu et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that transcription factor ZBTB20 is an essential element for neurological disorders. Here, we found that mice lacking <i>Zbtb20</i> exhibited impaired evening activity rhythms both in 12-hr light/12-hr dark (LD) cycles and under constant darkness conditions (DD). There are a limited number of functional genes that can be meaningfully correlated with evening activity or morning activity in mammals. To our knowledge, <i>Zbtb20</i>-knockout mice are the only model that mimics the phenotype of <i>Prok2</i> and <i>Prokr2</i>-knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Prosser et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, both <i>Prokr2</i> transcript level and protein level were significantly reduced in <i>Zbtb20</i>-depleted mice. Moreover, ZBTB20 directly regulated the transcription of <i>Prokr2</i>. The overexpression of PROKR2 in <i>Cre</i>-mediated <i>Zbtb20</i>-knockout mice partly restored evening activity. These data strongly suggested that ZBTB20 and PROKR2 are key pathway for the evening behavior. Finally, we unexpectedly found that ZBTB20 globally regulates mitochondrial, transportation and neurodegenerative enrichment pathways."

In the NS-ZB20KO mice, the amount of <i>Zbtb20</i> estimated by quantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR) was reduced by 90% in the SCN, 70% in the olfactory bulb and 90% in the cerebellum in NS-ZB20KO mice, with no change observed in <i>Zbtb20</i> expression in the liver (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Based on immunofluorescence staining, ZBTB20 protein was abundantly expressed in the SCN neurons from WT mice, but was almost undetectable in NS-ZB20KO mice determined by immunofluorescence staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Western blot analysis using anti-ZBTB20 antibodies revealed that expression of ZBTB20 was markedly reduced but not completely abolished in the hypothalami of NS-ZB20KO mice, potentially due to non-<i>Nestin</i>-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

A significant proportion of NS-ZB20KO mice died at approximately 3\u20134 months.

We found that the phase-delaying effects caused by applying saturating light pulses at CT12-CT18 were significantly smaller in NS-ZB20KO mice than in control mice (WT: \u22123.18 \u00b1 0.48\u2009hr n = 6; NS-ZB20KO; \u22122.31 \u00b1 0.36\u2009hr n = 10, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In contrast, there were no significant differences between genotypes in the phase advances induced by saturating light pulses at CT20-24 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, in response to a 6\u2009hr phase advance of the LD cycle, the activity offset in NS-ZB20KO mice readjusted to the new LD regimen much more slowly than that in the control mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The activity end of the control mice seemed to be masked by a light phase of phase advanced LD cycle in transients, which might be taken as a rapid phase-shift. On the other hand, the morning component was not masked probably because of enhanced morning activity in NS-ZB20KO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In response to 6\u2009hr phase-delay of the LD cycle, the control mice showed a gradual delayed offset of activity as expected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), while NS-ZB20KO mice ended their activity significantly earlier on day 1, suggesting a defect in the immediate adaptation to a new LD cycles in NS-ZB20KO mice. There were no significant difference in the phase delay for the subsequent days between genotypes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Indeed, the offset of activity showed a widened variation compared with the onset of activity between individual mice. We are uncertain whether lack of significant difference in the re-entrainment to a phase-delay shift of LD cycles in the subsequent days might result from counteraction by variation."

Interestingly, NS-ZB20KO mice had a difficulty in entraining to a short day (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). The time interval between the activity offset and light off was significantly different between genotypes for LD 6:18 (p&lt;0.01) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Thus, loss of <i>Zbtb20</i> shapes the behavioral response to light perturbation."

The levels of the circadian core components <i>Per1, Per2</i>, <i>Nr1d1</i>, <i>Nr1d2</i>, <i>Bmal1, Clock</i>, <i>Rora</i>, and <i>Rorb</i> in the SCN were comparable between control and NS-ZB20KO mice at CT8 and CT20 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In addition, circadian oscillation of BMAL1 protein in the NS-ZB20KO deficient SCN was normal (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), suggesting that the circadian oscillator was less affected in NS-ZB20KO mice, consistent with the above conclusion. The expression of <i>Dbp,</i> a clock output gene, and <i>Cry2</i> were elevated only at CT20 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). NS-ZB20KO mice showed no obvious effects on the transcript levels of <i>Vip, Avp, Prok2</i> or <i>Grp</i>. The expression levels of <i>Nsm</i>, <i><b>Lhx1</b></i>, <i>Rgs16</i> and <i>Gpr176</i>, recently reported as key regulators in SCN neurons (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bedont et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Doi et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hatori et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2015</a>), remained equivalent between NS-ZB20KO and control mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A</a>). The transcript level of Tgfa was only affected in NS-ZB20KO mice at CT8, without obvious differences at CT20. The transcript level of <i><b>Avpr1a</b> </i>was only affected in NS-ZB20KO mice at CT20 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). It is unclear whether the changes in these neuropeptides are consequences or the cause of the altered activity. Importantly, the accumulation of mRNA for <i><b>Prokr2</b></i>, a G protein-coupled receptor for PROK2 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Prosser et al., 2007</a>), was dramatically and consistently attenuated in NS-ZB20KO mice at both CT8 and CT20. We next examined the level of PROKR2. Western blot analysis using hypothalamus extracts confirmed that depletion of <i>Zbtb20</i> led to reduced PROKR2 protein, consistent with the changes that we observed in <i>Prokr2</i> mRNA levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B</a>)."

A deficiency in <i>Zbtb20</i> resulted in a remarkable decrease in <i>Prokr2</i> mRNA in the SCN, while no significant changes were observed in the mRNA accumulation or distribution of <i>Vip, Vpac2, Avp, Avpr1a, Prok2,Grp, Grpr</i> or <i>Lhx1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B</a>), suggesting that the loss of <i>Zbtb20</i> in SCN did not severely affect its differentiation. In addition, rhythmic alterations in AVP and VIP content were comparable between control and NS-ZB20KO mice (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). Immunofluorescence assays using antibodies targeting BMAL1, AVP and VIP showed intact morphogenesis of the SCN along the rostral-caudal axis in NS-ZB20KO mice (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>). Moreover, Nissl staining and neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) antibody, a marker for mature, post-mitotic neurons, were employed to test the physiological status of the SCN (<a href=\"#bib21\">Herculano-Houzel and Lent, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mullen et al., 1992</a>). Histology and NeuN staining showed no obvious differences between control and NS-ZB20KO mice (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). Furthermore, we found no obvious difference in the SCN region in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells or in glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)65/67, markers for GABAergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C and D</a>). Altogether, these results strongly suggested that the morphology and development of the SCN region remained intact, that ZBTB20 has strong effects on the positive regulation of <i>Prokr2</i> expression, and that the clock oscillator was not several impaired."

Considering that ZBTB20 is a transcription factor and can bind to core elements in target genes to regulate gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib61\">Xie et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>), we first analyzed the genomic sequence for the <i>Prokr2</i> gene, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nielsen et al., 2014</a>).

We thus scanned the enrichment region for P300 binding, from the TSS to -5 kb from <i>Prokr2,</i> using an anti-P300 antibody, and we found that P300 and ZBTB20 co-occupied overlapping M2 sites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In addition, acetylation of histone H3K9 also occurred at the M2 site (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), suggesting the coordinated regulation of active histone markers. To identify the transcription factor that mediated the regulation of the <i>Prokr2</i> gene by ZBTB20, we examined the ability of ZBTB20 to synergize with P300 in the regulation of <i>Prokr2</i> transcription in the cell line SCN 2.2 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Earnest et al., 1999</a>). ZBTB20 enhanced P300-mediated transcriptional activity on a <i>Prokr2</i> promoter reporter (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The synergistic effects of ZBTB20 and P300 were abolished when the M2 site was mutated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Interestingly, the enrichment profiles of ZBTB20 binding to the M2 site showed diurnal rhythms (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) together with P300 occupancy (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), although the accumulation of <i>Zbtb20</i> mRNA and ZBTB20 from the hypothalamus revealed very weak diurnal rhythms (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014-figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, the expression of <i>Zbtb20</i> and <i>Prokr2</i> overlapped in the SCN neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). These results, combined with the reduced <i>Prokr2</i> expression in NS-ZB20KO SCN neurons, strongly suggested that ZBTB20 regulated <i>Prokr2</i> expression and that <i>Prokr2</i> might be a downstream target of ZBTB20."

To exclude inter-cage variations (the friction force of each cage is different), mice were kept in the same wheel-running cage after injection. To avoid variation in the strength of activity of each mouse, each mouse served as its own control by comparing the measurements before and after injection. Unfortunately, most of the injected NS-ZB20KO mice died because NS-ZB20KO mice were unhealthy and surgical procedures could also lead quite easily to death. In the surviving mice, we assessed the activity distribution from day 3 to day 10 before injection and from day 10 to day 30 after injection.

We generated mice lacking <i>Zbtb20</i> in other head regions by crossing <i>Foxg1-Cre</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">H\u00e9bert and McConnell, 2000</a>), which is expressed by E7.5 in the facial ectoderm; head ectoderm; otic, optic, nasal and oral epithelia; forebrain; and foregut, with floxed <i>Zbtb20</i> alleles (<i>Zbtb20</i><sup>fl/fl</sup>), termed as Foxg1; ZB20KO mice. There was no obvious difference in <i>Zbtb20</i> expression in the SCN between Foxg1; ZB20KO and control mice (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The behavior of these mice showed obvious bimodal activity, although the total activity counts were higher than those of control mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), suggesting that loss of <i>Zbtb20</i> in <i>Foxg1</i> loci was not responsible for the unimodal activity of NS-ZB20KO mice. These results, combined with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Prosser et al., 2007</a>), suggested that PROKR2 signaling was directly correlated with the early evening activity.

The genes <i>Ndufb4, Ndufa2, Uqcr10, Ndufb7, Cox6a2</i>, and <i>Atp5g3</i> were considered critical, showing a high degree (Kappa statistics, 1.0) of sharing by these pathways. These pathways are involved in neurodegenerative disorders, indicating that progressive disorders might begin with mitochondrial dysfunction in NS-ZB20KO mice. In keeping with the evening activity peak at CT12, nocturnal animals should store energy to anticipate activity at CT12. However, we found that the most significantly enriched pathways, including protein catabolic processes and mitochondria, were disrupted in NS-ZB20KO mice at CT11, immediately before CT12 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We speculated that the enrichment of these pathways might be interpreted as a cause for the loss of the early evening activity because there was a lack of energy storage or mitochondrial dysfunction in NS-ZB20KO mice. Then, we compared the genes showing dynamic alteration between CT9 to CT11 between the NS-ZB20KO mice and the control mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Seven genes, including the dopamine receptor activity-related gene Drd1a, were down-regulated between CT9 to CT11 in the control mice, while these genes presented the opposite trend in the NS-ZB20KO mice. Conversely, the ATPase activity-related gene Atb1b2, the vesicle-mediated transport gene Elmo1, the glutamate clearance gene Slc1a2, and cell motility-related genes were obviously down-regulated from CT9 to CT11 in NS-ZB20KO mice, as shown on the heat maps (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>)."

We used duplex TMT labeling reagents (TMT-126 and TMT-127) to label proteins in the SCN tissues from both control and NS-ZB20KO mice. Proteins with TMT labeling ratios 20% higher or 20% lower than 1.0 were considered to be upregulated or downregulated, respectively. In total, 89 proteins were identified as upregulated and 99 as downregulated in the NS-ZB20KO mice (<a href=\"#SD12-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD13-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 4</a>), and these genes were enriched for involvement in intracellular signaling cascades, cellular macromolecular complex assembly, mitochondrion, and neurotransmitter transport. Finally, we integrated the NS-ZB20KO RNA-Seq data sets with proteomic data sets to identify genes altered at both the transcription and translation levels. We found that 10 genes overlapped: Spr, Cd47, Atp5e, Tspan2, Erp44, Pde10a, Ubap2l, Psmc5, Ctnnd2 and Slc25a18 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

ATP5E is associated with several diseases, including isolated ATP synthase deficiency and mitochondrial complex III deficiency, nuclear type 5.

Compared to the number of identified core clock genes, very few circadian output genes have been isolated, indicating that clock output factors might be important for development such that mutations are lethal, or that these genes compensate for each other, i.e., are functionally redundant. In this study, we demonstrated that NS-ZB20KO mice showed a time-dependent loss of early evening activity and substantially increased morning activity. Our results strongly suggest that severe reduction in the <i>Prokr2</i> expression level resulted in the absence of early evening activity in NS-ZB20KO mice. More importantly, the phenotype in NS-ZB20KO mice can be partly rescued by the overexpression of PROKR2 in the SCN region, and the deletion of <i>Zbtb20</i> using <i>Foxg1-Cre</i> in other head regions beyond the thalamus and hypothalamus did not phenocopy the phenotypes of NS-ZB20KO mice, indicating that ZBTB20-mediated <i>Prokr2</i> signaling is critical for rhythmic behavioral outputs from the SCN."

For instance, the loss of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) dramatically impaired circadian rhythms and behavior (<a href=\"#bib5\">Aton et al., 2005</a>), while mice lacking AVP receptor V1a showed significantly elongated activity time (<a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2009</a>). Recent studies have demonstrated that V1a and V1b signals confer intrinsic resistance to external perturbations on the SCN (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</a>). However, some neuropeptides can compensate for each other, such as GRP and AVP (<a href=\"#bib36\">Maywood et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, the <i>Prokr2</i> gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor for PROK2 that has also been implicated in linking circadian pacemakers to behavioral output without affecting the molecular oscillator (<a href=\"#bib44\">Prosser et al., 2007</a>). PROK2 is a peptide expressed in subpopulations of SCN neurons, including those producing AVP, VIP, and GRP, and PROK2 expression is induced by light pulses that reset the clock (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Masumoto et al., 2006</a>). This may account for our observation of impaired entrainment in NS-ZB20KO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

                        "text": "The loss of <i>Prok2</i> or <i>Prokr2</i> has a phenotype surprisingly similar to that observed in NS-ZB20KO mice. Unlike the phenotypes observed in the TGFa signal (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kramer et al., 2001</a>) and the <i>Clc</i> signal (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kraves and Weitz, 2006</a>), the loss of <i>Zbtb20</i> resulted in the profound disruption of the activity/rest cycle under both LD and DD conditions. Because the circadian period was only subtly affected (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and the expression levels of core clock genes in the SCN were comparable between the control and NS-ZB20KO mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), we hypothesized that ZBTB20 mainly targets the output pathway. In addition, metabolic and body temperature rhythms were maintained with a possible compromise in activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). Furthermore, most circadian genes in peripheral tissues showed unperturbed rhythms (data not shown). This also fits with an output role for <i>Zbtb20</i>. A relative redistribution of activity from early to late circadian night was suggested in <i>Prokr2</i> null mice (<a href=\"#bib44\">Prosser et al., 2007</a>). We thus asked whether a hyperactivity peak during early morning was a 180\u00b0 reversal from the early evening peak in NS-ZB20KO mice. We found that light pulses during CT12-CT18 induced a phase delay despite entrained behavior being weak in NS-ZB20KO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This suggested that CT12\u2013CT18 was subjective early evening for NS-ZB20KO mice. Moreover, light pulses during CT20-CT24 caused a phase advance, suggesting that CT20-CT24 was late night for NS-ZB20KO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We therefore suggested that the loss of <i>Zbtb20</i> resulted in the ablation of evening behavioral rhythms rather than a shift from the early evening peak to an early morning peak, although the mechanism underlying the burst of early morning activity remains unclear."

In addition to showing that the phenotype of NS-ZB20KO mice resembles that observed in <i>Prokr2</i> null mice (<a href=\"#bib44\">Prosser et al., 2007</a>), we found that ZBTB20 bound to the <i>Prokr2</i> promoter and activated <i>Prokr2</i> transcription in SCN 2.2 cells along with P300. In the absence of <i>Zbtb20</i>, we observed a strongly decreased level of <i>Prokr2</i> expression. Moreover, in our rescue experiments with overexpression of <i>Prokr2</i> in NS-ZB20KO mice, abnormal behavior was partially restored. Thus, it is clear that ZBTB20 mediated PROKR2 signaling is essential for the bimodal activity output. Similar models have been proposed in previous reports in which morning and evening oscillators were organized in the SCN and regulated morning behavior and evening behavior (<a href=\"#bib24\">Inagaki et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kon et al., 2014</a>). We also generated AVP and VIP <i>Cre</i> mice in order to delete <i>Zbtb20</i> in these neurons. However, mice lacking <i>Zbtb20</i> in AVP or VIP neurons showed no obvious behavioral defects (data not shown). Because the NS-ZB20KO mice are generally sick, it is difficult to determine how much of the circadian defect is specifically due to the requirement for ZBTB20-<i>Prokr2</i> function and how much is simply due to fact that NS-ZB20KO mice suffer from a myriad of neurological and metabolic maladies. However, we generated mice with the deletion of <i>Zbtb20</i> in neurons expressing <i>Foxg1</i>, a forebrain marker, and we found that Foxg1; ZB20KO mice had normal circadian activity. Because Zbtb20 is enriched in the SCN and because Prokr2 and Prok2 are also expressed in multiple types of neurons, coupling among these neurons might play an important role in the early evening activity output. Together with data from previous studies on Prok2 and Prokr2 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Prosser et al., 2007</a>), we propose that ZBTB20 is a convincing candidate as a circadian oscillator to produce coherent rhythmic outputs."

Understanding how the central circadian pacemaker links molecular timekeeping with neuronal outputs is a central question in chronobiology and of intense interest to the field. Using a Nestin-Cre mediated knockdown of ZBT20 throughout the nervous system (ZBT20KO), the authors present compelling evidence that the loss of this transcription factor results in locomotor rhythm abnormalities that are highly reminiscent of the abnormalities seen previously in mice lacking the neuropeptide Prokineticin-2 (Prok2) or it's receptor (Prokr2). The authors provide strong evidence of a link between ZBT20 and Prok2 signaling by showing that Prokr2 levels are dramatically lowered in the SCN ZBT20KO mice and that ZBT20 acts a positive transcriptional regulator of Prokr2 expression in cultured suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) cells. The evidence supporting this link is very strong. The evidence that these observations provide specific insights into circadian output pathways in the SCN is less strong (see below)."

For example, ZBT20KO mice have significantly reduced brain size and weight and a significant proportion of the ZBT20KO die before reaching four months of age. Thus, despite the very nice link the authors have made between ZBT20 and Prokr2, it is difficult to know how much of the circadian defects described are due specifically to the requirement for ZBT20/Prokr2 function in the central clock, and how much was simply due to fact that the ZBT20KO were suffering from myriad neurological and metabolic maladies.

The authors mention attempting ZBT20 knockdowns in cell types that are more specific to circadian timekeeping (VIP and AVP expressing cells), but report that these mice had normal circadian activity rhythms.
