Abnormal brain rhythms are considered as potential pathophysiological mechanisms causing mental disease, but the underlying network defects are largely unknown. We find that mice expressing truncated <i>Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1</i> (Disc1), which mirror a high-prevalence genotype for human psychiatric illness, show depression-related behavior. Theta and low-gamma synchrony in the prelimbic cortex (PrlC) is impaired in Disc1 mice and inversely correlated with the extent of behavioural despair. While weak theta activity is driven by the hippocampus, disturbance of low-gamma oscillations is caused by local defects of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing fast-spiking interneurons (FS-INs). The number of FS-INs is reduced, they receive fewer excitatory inputs, and form fewer release sites on targets. Computational analysis indicates that weak excitatory input and inhibitory output of FS-INs may lead to impaired gamma oscillations. Our data link network defects with a gene mutation underlying depression in humans."

Abnormal brain rhythms are considered as potential pathophysiological mechanisms causing mental disease, but the underlying network defects are largely unknown. We find that mice expressing truncated <i>Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1</i> (Disc1), which mirror a high-prevalence genotype for human psychiatric illness, show depression-related behavior. Theta and low-gamma synchrony in the prelimbic cortex (PrlC) is impaired in Disc1 mice and inversely correlated with the extent of behavioural despair. While weak theta activity is driven by the hippocampus, disturbance of low-gamma oscillations is caused by local defects of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing fast-spiking interneurons (FS-INs). The number of FS-INs is reduced, they receive fewer excitatory inputs, and form fewer release sites on targets. Computational analysis indicates that weak excitatory input and inhibitory output of FS-INs may lead to impaired gamma oscillations. Our data link network defects with a gene mutation underlying depression in humans."

As the prelimbic cortex combines inputs from various other brain areas, a further challenge will be to examine whether these inputs influence the activity of the prelimbic cortex and thus contribute to depression-related behavior."

Mutations in \u2018risk genes\u2019 enhance the probability to develop these disorders, pointing to a strong genetic component in the etiology of mental illnesses (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ross et al., 2006</a>). More than two decades ago, <i>DISC1</i> has been identified as a major genetic risk factor involved in psychiatric disorders (<a href=\"#bib41\">St Clair et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Blackwood et al., 2001</a>). The original discovery came from a Scottish family carrying a large c-terminal 1:11 translocation in the <i>DISC1</i> gene downstream of exon eight, which results in a c-terminal truncation of <i>DISC1</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">St Clair et al., 1990</a>). Family members who are affected by the mutation suffer from mental illness including major depression (10 cases), schizophrenia (7 cases) or bipolar disorder (1 case, <a href=\"#bib41\">St Clair et al., 1990</a>). By comparison (48 cases), no major psychiatric disease was diagnosed in any of the relatives lacking <i>DISC1</i> truncation. Thus, truncation of <i>DISC1</i> constitutes one of the largest known risk factors for mental illness."

Those Disc1 mice allow to directly examine the impact of a depression- and schizophrenia-related risk gene mutation on behaviour and the activity of neuronal networks involved in the control of cognitive functions. We find that Disc1 mice show increased immobility during the tail-suspension (TST) and forced swim test broadly accepted as depression-related behavioural changes in rodents (<a href=\"#bib30\">Porsolt et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Steru et al., 1985</a>). This behavioural phenotype correlates with abnormalities in the synchrony of low-gamma oscillations (30\u201350 Hz) in the prelimbic cortex (PrlC), which have been implicated in supporting encoding of information (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fries et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, we provide evidence that network malfunction is related by a profound defect of FS-INs, including reduced numbers of FS-INs as well as alterations in their synaptic connections. Thus, our study provides a correlative link between behavioural alterations in Disc1 mice and the possible underlying cellular and synaptic mechanisms."

We probed depression-related traits using highly validated tests for anhedonia (<a href=\"#bib21\">LeGates et al., 2012</a>) and behavioural despair (<a href=\"#bib30\">Porsolt et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Steru et al., 1985</a>) in rodents. Disc1 mice showed no deficit in sucrose preference, which is used to quantify anhedonia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, in the TST and forced swim test, in which animals exhibit epochs of immobility that are thought to reflect states of behavioural despair intersected by periods of active escape, Disc1 mice showed longer periods of immobility (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Behavioural variability among individuals was high and therefore resulted in a moderately but significantly enhanced mean immobility by 35% in the TST and by 18% in the forced swim test of Disc1 mice (TST: p = 0.015, 22 Disc1 and 14 control mice; forced swimming: p = 0.049, 22 and 20 mice; Cohen's <i>d</i> of 0.82 and 0.65 corresponding to a strong and moderate effect size, respectively [<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>]). Both genotypes reached similar movement speeds in the open field arena, indicating that high immobility in the behavioural despair tests cannot be caused by motor impairment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Both groups showed identical spatial learning and numbers of working memory errors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>). We confirmed intact working memory of Disc1 mice in a delayed match-to-sample and a spontaneous alternation task (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, Disc1 mice could normally learn reward rules in a spatial extra-dimensional paradigm-shifting task (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This test resembles features of the Wisonsin card sorting test, in which schizophrenia patients typically show deficits (<a href=\"#bib27\">Okubo et al., 1997</a>). Finally, Disc1 mice had no abnormalities in anxiety or sociability (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 3, 4</a>). Thus, Disc1 mice showed a specific phenotype broadly interpreted as depression-related behavioural despair (<a href=\"#bib30\">Porsolt et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Steru et al., 1985</a>)."

We therefore hypothesized that PrlC dysfunction may be involved in the emergence of behavioural despair of Disc1 mice. By using antibody labelling against the immediate early gene cFos as a marker of neurons which underwent enhanced activity, we found that TST increased the number of cFos-positive cells in the PrlC compared to baseline in the home cage in both Disc1 and control mice, indicating that the PrlC is involved in controlling behavioural despair (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The elevation of cFos-positive cells by TST occurred in both, Disc1 as well as control mice, suggesting that no major differences in PrlC activation upon exposure to TST may exist between genotypes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

We therefore speculated that Disc1 truncation might cause changes in rhythmic activity patterns rather than gross activity levels in the PrlC. To test for this possibility, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in the PrlC of behaving mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Longer freeze times of Disc1 mice were apparent in the electrode-implanted sample (8 Disc1 and 6 control mice, p = 0.0041; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) similar to non-implanted Disc1 mice. During TST, Disc1 mice showed reduced normalized power and amplitude in the theta (6\u201312 Hz, p = 0.012 and p = 0.001, respectively) and low-gamma (30\u201350 Hz, p = 0.003 and p = 0.002, respectively) but not high gamma band (80\u2013100 Hz, p = 0.11 and p = 0.239, respectively; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>). Oscillations were similarly impaired during home cage exploration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). These observations were independent of the behavioral state and present during movement and passive coping (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When data from Disc1 and control mice were pooled, theta and low-gamma power linearly correlated with freeze duration in TST (theta<sub>TST</sub> p = 0.0061 and low-gamma<sub>TST</sub> p = 0.0007, respectively; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, left) but not with immobility in the home cage (theta<sub>baseline</sub> p = 0.829 and low-gamma<sub>baseline</sub> p = 0.782, respectively; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, right), showing that reduced synchrony of theta and low-gamma oscillations impairs TST-specific cortical processing rather than alterations in general locomotion. Moreover, low-gamma but not theta power in the home cage could significantly predict TST freeze duration when Disc1 and control data were pooled (p = 0.033, p = 0.114, respectively; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), indicating that local low-gamma power correlates with defects of the intrinsic function of the prefrontal network irrespective of the animal's behaviour. Recordings of spontaneous low-gamma oscillations during UP states under anaesthesia (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hasenstaub et al., 2005</a>) confirmed the independence of low-gamma power from behaviour-dependent brain state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Jointly these data suggest that defective theta<sub>TST</sub> and low-gamma<sub>TST+baseline</sub> are correlated with behavioural despair of Disc1 mice."

Consistent with the hippocampal drive of theta oscillations to the PrlC, cross-correlation analysis of theta-filtered signals in simultaneous LFP recordings from dorsal CA1 and PrlC revealed a \u223c30 ms peak time lag in both Disc1 and control mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). In agreement with the intact working memory of Disc1 mice, for which high synchrony of theta oscillations between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex is required (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jones and Wilson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Siapas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sigurdsson et al., 2010</a>), coherence in the theta band was comparable between genotypes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Our cFos labelling suggested that TST directly activated the PrlC network (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and that local PrlC mechanisms may contribute to the TST phenotype of Disc1 mice. The PrlC of Disc1 mice contained significantly fewer PV-positive INs (\u223c40% reduction, p = 0.0037, 9 Disc1 and 8 control mice, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A similar reduction in PV-positive cells was observed in CA1 (\u223c40%; p = 0.022) but not in the ventro-orbital cortex (p = 0.375; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). PV-positive cells of both genotypes expressed Disc1 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast, the number of somatostatin-expressing INs (p = 0.392) and total cell density (DAPI area, p = 0.158) were unchanged (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Studies on schizophrenia patients suggested that PV-expression might be down-regulated in FS-INs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hashimoto et al., 2003</a>). However, detection of PV immunoreactivity in electrophysiologically identified FS-INs in PrlC slices did not depend on the genotype (Disc1: 9/16 cells; control: 10/19 cells; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Moreover, the number of INs expressing calbindin, a marker for FS-INs partially coexpressed with PV (<a href=\"#bib23\">Markram et al., 2004</a>), was reduced in the Disc1 PrlC in vivo (\u223c25% reduction, p = 0.027, 6 Disc1 and 5 control mice, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), supporting our conclusion of reduced PV-cell quantity rather than PV content of FS-INs. Finally, the frequency of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) recorded in PCs was significantly reduced in the PrlC of Disc1 mice, consistent with a loss of PV-positive cells (p = 0.025, 24 Disc1 and 15 control cells; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These data further suggested a lack of mechanisms compensating for the reduced PV cell population."

Bootstrapping demonstrated that errors in the parameter estimation were similar to previous reports (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kraushaar and Jonas, 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Failure rate and coefficient of variation of uIPSCs were higher in Disc1 pairs (p = 0.015 and p = 0.008, respectively; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), whereas the skewness was unchanged (p = 0.503, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), confirming a change in <i>Nr</i> rather than <i>Pr</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kerr et al., 2008</a>). Paired-pulse behaviour and kinetic properties of uIPSCs did not depend on the genotype, further excluding altered <i>Pr</i> or somatodendritic synapse location, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Amplitudes of quantal IPSCs recorded in the presence of extracellular 5.5 mM strontium were not significantly different between genotypes (4 and 5 pairs; p = 0.195). Moreover, mIPSCs had similar mean size in PCs located in the PrlC of Disc1 and control mice, further confirming similar <i>Qr</i> (24 and 15 cells, p = 0.388; <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Thus, Disc1 FS-INs form \u223c60% fewer release sites per target PC, resulting in an according reduction of unitary inhibitory strength. How can the contradiction between similar numbers of axonal release sites per FS-IN but fewer synaptic contacts per FS-IN-to-PC connection in Disc1 PrlC be reconciled? Interestingly, connection probability defined as the probability to record from connected FS-IN-to-PC pairs was \u223cthreefold higher in Disc1 mice (Disc1: 35.4%, control: 11.5%, p &lt; 0.001; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting that redistribution of release sites at the expense of individual connection strength might contribute to low-gamma defects."

To address whether these alterations influence the synchrony of low-gamma oscillations, we designed computational neuronal network models with synaptically connected FS-INs and PCs and compared scenarios with experimentally-driven synaptic properties and connectivities from Disc1 and control prefrontal cortices (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wang and Buzs\u00e1ki, 1996</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Both network models generated synchronous low-gamma activity patterns (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These oscillations were generated by a recurrent PC \u2192 FS-IN \u2192 PC network over a broad range of excitatory drives provided to both FS-INs and PCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), in agreement with current theories on the generation of gamma rhythms in cortical networks (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tiesinga and Sejnowski, 2009</a>). Consistent with gamma oscillations in prefrontal areas of rodents (<a href=\"#bib24\">Massi et al., 2012</a>) and monkeys (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wilson et al., 1994</a>), INs discharged at higher rates than PCs (mean f<sub>AP</sub>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Spike histograms as well as LFP analogs demonstrated high synchrony of low-gamma activity in the control network model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>; black). In contrast, reduced synchrony of low-gamma emerged in the Disc1 circuit (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>; green; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Precise timing of PC activity was proposed an important requirement for information processing (<a href=\"#bib45\">Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010</a>). Cross-correlation analysis of FS-IN and PC discharges and quantification of PC spike times in relation to FS-IN activity revealed that spike timing fidelity of PCs was high in the control but strongly reduced in the Disc 1 network model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This corresponds to a gamma rhythm mediated by a network of mutually connected FS-INs (interneuron gamma (ING)-mechanism). Shifting the excitation away from the FS-INs and recruiting more PCs reduced the oscillation frequency and established a gamma rhythm mediated by recurrent PC-IN connections (pyramidal-interneuron gamma (PING)-mechanism).

Notably and in line with the intact working memory of Disc1 mice (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sigurdsson et al., 2010</a>), phase-locking between hippocampal and prefrontal regions was unchanged. In contrast, our results suggest that reduced low-gamma synchrony in the PrlC may contribute to enhanced immobility of Disc1 mice, interpreted as depression-related behaviour (<a href=\"#bib30\">Porsolt et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Steru et al., 1985</a>), and the extent of synchrony reduction predicted the magnitude of the phenotype. The mean Disc1 phenotype differed mildly but significantly from controls which can be largely explained by the high inter-individual variability in behaviour. We identified impaired synaptic excitatory input and inhibitory output of PV-FS-INs in the Disc1 PrlC as a strong candidate mechanism underlying low-gamma defects. Thus, truncation of <i>DISC1</i> in human patients may contribute to the development of depression by affecting anatomical and physiological properties of prefrontal PV-FS-INs."

Single cell recordings during spontaneous gamma oscillations in vivo (<a href=\"#bib24\">Massi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Pernia-Andrade and Jonas, 2014</a>) and during pharmacologically induced gamma activity patterns in vitro (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hajos et al., 2004</a>) revealed that strength of perisomatic inhibition and timed synaptic feedback excitation of FS-INs are key parameters setting gamma synchrony in healthy cortical networks, including the PrlC (<a href=\"#bib13\">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</a>) and the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hajos et al., 2004</a>). Furthermore, optophysiological activation or silencing of PV-IN populations result in the enhancement or suppression of gamma power in the prefrontal cortex in vivo, respectively (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sohal et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, recruitment of FS-INs by activating PC assemblies increases gamma power in the somatosensory cortex (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cardin et al., 2009</a>). Thus, the observed reduced excitatory input to FS-INs, which may cause diminished recruitment of these cells, as well as the impaired synaptic output of FS-INs will ultimately result in a loss of gamma synchrony. Gamma synchrony is also sensitive against changes in strength of gap coupling among FS-INs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bartos et al., 2002</a>). Whether this synaptic property is altered in Disc1 mice would need further investigations. Our conclusions fit also to recent investigations in cortical slice preparations from mouse models for psychiatric disorders caused by mutations of genes encoding the Lysophosphatidic acid 1 receptor (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cunningham et al., 2006</a>), neuregulin-1 or ErbB4 receptor (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fisahn et al., 2009</a>). Impairment of pharmacologically induced gamma activity in these studies correlated with a marked loss of cortical PV-expressing cells. Although the mechanisms underlying the loss of synchronous gamma oscillations were not examined in these investigations, they indicate that excitation-inhibition imbalance may be the pathophysiological mechanism."

Studies of Disc1 protein interactions indicate a central role in developmental processes such as morphological differentiation and neuronal migration (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ozeki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Duan et al., 2007</a>). Recent examinations established a direct link between Disc1 and axon growth. Disc1 knockout resulted in reduced axon elongation in cultured hippocampal cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Shinoda et al., 2007</a>). Neurotrophin-3 signaling via phosphorylation of extracellular signal related kinase 1/2 (ERK-1/2) is a crucial regulator of axon development, and Disc1 knockdown has been shown to abolish this phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Shinoda et al., 2007</a>). Recent findings in the hippocampus further suggest a role for Disc1 in axonal path-finding. The axons of dentate gyrus granule cells, the mossy fibers, were redistributed from their normal location in strata lucidum and oriens towards the PC layer of CA3 in a mouse model expressing truncated Disc1 <a href=\"#bib10\">(Faulkner et al., 2008</a>). Disc1 is highly expressed in the developing brain (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ozeki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schurov et al., 2004</a>), highlighting its likely role in neuronal maturation and network wiring. Although no reports specifically for GABAergic axons exist, these results suggest that the effects of <i>DISC1</i> truncation are not PC-specific but may also affect FS-IN axons during development. Finally, Disc1 is required for the migration of IN precursors from the ganglionic eminences to the cortex (<a href=\"#bib42\">Steinecke et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, truncated <i>DISC1</i> might cause a migratory block of FS-INs, which could lead to the observed reduced PV cell numbers in the adult prefrontal cortex of this study."

During behavioural tests, adult Disc1 mice (<a href=\"#bib35\">Shen et al., 2008</a>) (&gt;5 weeks) were housed with 2\u20135 animals per cage. Animals were accustomed to handling in daily sessions for at least two days prior to experimentation. For TST, the tail of the mice was fixed with tape to a horizontal bar at \u223c25 cm height. Movement was recorded with an IP camera. All mice were tested once. The forced swim test was performed in a 2 l glass beaker filled with 1 l tap water. Both tests lasted 6 min. For open field analysis, the mice were placed in a 30 \u00d7 30 cm arena and videotaped for 10 min. Two regions of interest of identical area (center, periphery) were defined. The percentage time spent in both regions and the total distance travelled were quantified. To test for anhedonia, mice were housed individually with two drinking bottles per cage, one containing 1% sucrose solution, the other tap water. Liquid consumption from both bottles was measured after 48 hr. Prior to this test, mice were kept on a two-bottle paradigm for 2\u20135 days. The position of the sucrose containing flask was chosen randomly for each cage. Spatial reference and spatial working memory were tested in a radial 6-arm water maze in a bathing pool (120 cm diameter). The water (19\u201321\u00b0C) was whitened with non-toxic tempera colour. Mice were released from a random start arm and allowed to find the hidden platform within 1.5 min. After this time window mice were guided to the platform by the experimenter. Animals were allowed to rest on the platform for 15 s. Four runs per day were performed for 5 days with fixed target and random starting arm locations. After the last run a probe trial was conducted with the platform removed from the maze. Arm entry detection and tracking of movement was performed automatically with custom-made ImageJ routines based on MTrack2 and Python routines. Spatial reference memory errors were defined as entries in non-target arms and spatial working memory errors as re-entries in previously explored non-target arms within a trial. A match-to-place task was performed in a 3-arm water maze with a start arm, a target arm with hidden platform, and a non-target arm. Each mouse first underwent a 30 s extinction trial with only start arm and non-target arm open. After a 30 s inter-trial interval, the mouse was put back in the start arm, this time with both arms accessible (sample trial). Animals were allowed to find the platform within 1.5 min and were guided to the platform in case they failed to perform the task. Mice rested on the platform for 15 s upon arrival. Finally, after another 30 s inter-trial interval, the match trial task was conducted similarly to the sample trial. A trial was defined as correct if the mouse first entered the target arm in the match trial (3 runs per day for 4 days). The extradimensional paradigm-shifting test was carried out in a Y-maze. Mice were food-restricted for 5 days. During this time, they were trained to search for food reward available at the end of both target arms upon release from the start arm. From day 6 onward, mice received food reward in the right arm (\u2018right correct\u2019 task). During all tasks, both target arms were randomly illuminated with LEDs. When mice reached the learning criterion (10 subsequent correct runs or 1 error in 12 runs), the reward rule was switched to \u2018light on\u2014correct arm\u2019. Learning was measured in 10 subsequent runs and from learning curves computed with the Learning Analysis toolbox (<a href=\"#bib39\">Smith et al., 2004</a>). Social behaviour was measured in a 3-chamber social interaction arena composed of two side chambers and one central chamber (30 \u00d7 19 cm each). Both side chambers contained a wire pencil cup. In the first habituation run, mice explore the arena. In the second run, a stranger mouse was placed in one randomly chosen cup (individual run duration 10 min). The total travel distance and time spent in each compartment were quantified. For all tests, animals were randomly chosen and test apparatuses, except the water maze, were cleaned with 70% ethanol between animals."

For each parameter combination a probability density function was created as a sum of Gaussians with means at Qr*i and width SDQr*i for i in range 1 to Nr. Each Gaussian was multiplied with the binomial probability of release at i release sites with a given Pr (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kraushaar and Jonas, 2000</a>). Failures were included as the binomial probability of release at zero sites and set as point zero of the compound probability density function. The best fit of the data was determined with the maximum-likelihood-estimation procedure. To receive confidence intervals of the estimated parameters we performed bootstrap analysis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kraushaar and Jonas, 2000</a>). For bootstrap analysis the original amplitudes of an experiment were loaded and bootstrap datasets were created from the n data points as n random picks with replacement. Binomial fitting was then performed on the bootstrap data with maximum-likelihood-estimation. The whole procedure was repeated 100- times for each experiment. Quantal uIPSCs were recorded in pairs with extracellular CaCl<sub>2</sub> replaced with SrCl<sub>2</sub> (5.5 mM). Asynchronous release was triggered under these conditions by evoking action potential trains (10 pulses, 50 Hz) in the presynaptic neuron. Asychronously released quanta were detected up to 400 ms after the train."

Cells and boutons were counted manually without knowing the genotype. Data were compared with an automated approach in which colocalization was quantified from the same images with custom-made routines written in ImageJ's macro language. Detection thresholds were set to both channels independently with the ImageJ \u2018triangle\u2019 method until 5, 10, 25, 50 or 70 brightest percent of pixels remained. Both channels were multiplied with each other to reveal the fraction of colocalized areas. As s control, the same analysis was performed with VGAT images rotated by 90\u00b0 to determine random colocalizations which were subtracted from colocalizations. Automated analysis gave results that were comparable to manual counting (data not shown). To define bouton density in FS-INs, boutons of intracellularly labelled cells were visually identified as brighter and thicker spots in the biocytin labelled axon. Axon segments (60\u2013130 \u00b5m length) were chosen pseudorandomly from the labelled neuron. In vivo, boutons of individual PV-expressing axons (27\u2013124 \u00b5m length) were identified in confocal z-stacks as structures colocalizing VGAT.

FS-INs and PCs were equipped with Hodgkin-Huxley-type conductances to reproduce the FS phenotype in INs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wang and Buzs\u00e1ki, 1996</a>) and regular-spiking in PCs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hemond et al., 2008</a>). Synaptic connections were formed randomly following a distance-dependent Gaussian profile (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). FS-INs were electrically coupled to four of their nearest eight neighbour INs using a coupling conductance of 0.01 nS (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bartos et al., 2002</a>). Strength and distribution of electrical coupling among FS-INs have not been experimentally examined in Disc1 and control mice and kept the same in both models (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Mutual E\u2013E synapses among PCs were excluded for simplicity of network design and interpretation. Events were triggered after the presynaptic action potential following a latency which consisted of a constant part (the release phase; 0.5 ms) plus a distance-dependent part (the action potential conduction phase; distance in IN\u2013IN spacing \u00d7 0.05 ms; action potential conduction velocity 0.25 ms<sup>\u22121</sup>; [<a href=\"#bib2\">Bartos et al., 2002</a>]).

The maximum of the resulting power spectrum indicated the prominent oscillation frequency and the power at this maximum plus the two adjacent frequencies (range: \u00b1 1 Hz) were used to quantify the mean power of the oscillation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013E</a>). To determine time lag histograms of PC spikes, we first identified the peaks of FS-IN activity in every gamma cycle and then calculated for every PC spike the time lag to its closest FS-IN peak (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We described the resulting time lag distribution with a single measure: <i>PC sync</i> = probability of a single PC spike per gamma cycle/variance (\u03c3<sup>2</sup>) of time lags. Using this definition, <i>PC sync</i> describes the precision of PC spikes in relation to IN activity and PC time locking to the ongoing gamma oscillation.

Thus, NpHR-tdT is only expressed in Cre-recombinase-expressing PV-cells. We successfully tested this approach in the hippocampus of PV-Cre mice in a previous set of experiments. After rAAV injection we implanted optical fibers for the activation of NpHR by light (565 nm) with the aim to silence fast-spiking PV-interneurons. Three weeks after virus expression we aimed to ask whether PV-cell silencing can reproduce the observed reduced PV-interneuron-mediated inhibition in the prefrontal cortex as well as reduced mobility of mice. However, we were unexpectedly confronted with several technical problems, which resulted in a time delay of our revision for which we are very sorry. The major problem was that the expression of NpHR was not homogeneous in the PV-cell population as expected from our earlier experiments. Due to the already caused time delay we decided not to repeat this set of experiments. Thus, all concerns regarding correlation and causation were addressed by careful rewriting of the manuscript."

First, we determined the amplitude of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) recorded in 0.5 \u00b5M TTX in PCs of the PrlC. The rationale behind this experiment is the fact that most mIPSCs originate from PV-INs, which form the largest group of IN types in the neocortex (<a href=\"#bib23\">Markram et al., 2004</a>; Nat Rev Neurosci 5:793-807). There was no difference in the amplitude of mIPSCs between both genotypes (24 Disc1 <i>vs</i> 15 control PCs; <i>P</i>=0.388). Indeed, with a mean size of \u223c21 pA of both groups, it was in a similar range as <i>Qr</i> obtained with multiple probability-compound binomial model (\u223c28 pA), supporting the reliability of the analysis. These data are shown in the new <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 4</a> of the revised manuscript and included in the second paragraph of the subsection headed \u201cReduced inhibitory output and excitatory input signaling of fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the prefrontal cortex of Disc1 mice\u201d. Second, we followed the proposal of the reviewers and performed new-paired recordings between presynaptic fast-spiking interneurons and postsynaptic PCs in the presence of 5.5 mM strontium (SrCl<sub>2</sub>). The amplitude of quantal IPSCs measured under these conditions did not significantly differ among genotypes (Disc1: 10.0 \u00b1 0.8 pA in Disc1, 4 pairs; control: 12.0 \u00b1 .1.5 pA; 5 pairs; <i>p</i>=0.195). We noted that the mean IPSC amplitudes measured in SrCl<sub>2</sub> were smaller than the mean amplitudes of mIPSCs or the predictions from our probability compound binomial model. We used the equation <i>A</i>=<i>N</i>*<i>p</i>*<i>q</i> to calculate <i>N</i> for each mean IPSC amplitude (<i>A</i>) from individual paired recordings using the quantal size (<i>q</i>) obtained in SrCl<sub>2</sub> recordings over a wide range of <i>p</i> values (0.2-1).

To further strengthen this point, we computed Cohen's <i>d</i>, a measure of effect size (Lakens 2013; Front Psychol 4:863). Cohen's <i>d</i> of TST and FST were 0.82 and 0.65, respectively, which corresponds to a strong and intermediate effect size, respectively. Our study shows an enormous specificity of the Disc1 mutation on the behavioural level. We would therefore like to keep the behavioural analysis in the manuscript. However, we follow the reviewers\u2019 request and toned down the behavioural impact of the Disc1 mutation in the first paragraph of the Results section. We furthermore included Cohen's <i>d</i> measures in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>."

(1998; J Physiol 510:881) and Kraushaar and Jonas (2000; J Neurosci 20:5594) to estimate the number of functional release sites at FS-IN to PC synapses. Following the suggestion of the reviewer we further quantified and compared quantal IPSCs in PCs of the PrlC of Disc1 and control slices. First, we recorded mIPSCs in the presence of 0.5 \u00b5M TTX and show that they had similar amplitudes among genotypes (Disc1: 20.1 \u00b1 1.1 pA; control: 21.9 \u00b1 1.9 pA; <i>p</i>=0.388). These values were also similar to quantal IPSCs obtained from FS-IN to PC paired recordings in the dentate gyrus of wild type mice (18.75 \u00b1 1.75 pA; 4 pairs) at low release probability (0.5 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and similar to quantal IPSCs defined by MP-CBA in this study (\u223c28 pA). We therefore believe that quantal IPSC size defined by MP-CBA in this study is in a realistic range. Second, following the reviewers\u2019 proposal, we newly performed paired recordings in slices of the PrlC in the presence of extracellular 5.5 mM SrCl2 (Disc1: 10.0 \u00b1 0.8 pA in Disc1, 4 pairs; control: 12.0 \u00b1 .1.5 pA; 5 pairs; <i>p</i>=0.195). As mentioned in point 4 of our response to the reviewing editor, we noted that the IPSC amplitudes measured in SrCl2 were smaller than mIPSCs or predictions from our MT-CBA which may be caused by a direct so far unexamined effect of strontium on GABAA receptors. However, to further follow this issue, we calculated <i>N</i> for the amplitudes <i>A</i> of uIPSCs using the <i>q</i> obtained in SrCl<sub>2</sub> quantal recordings according to <i>A</i>=<i>N</i>*<i>P</i>*<i>q</i>. We performed the calculation over a wide range of <i>P</i> values (0.2-1). This analysis showed that, while the resulting predicted value of <i>N</i> depends as expected on <i>P</i>, there is always a significantly smaller <i>N</i> in Disc1 compared to control pairs (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). These data are now included in <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 4</a> and in the second paragraph of the subsection headed \u201cReduced inhibitory output and excitatory input signaling of fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the prefrontal cortex of Disc1 mice\u201d."

In fact, we show that the average synaptic latency, which can be used as indirect measure for synaptic distance (Str\u00fcber et al. 2015; PNAS 112(4):1220-1225), was the same beween Disc1 and controls (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). This is now more clearly stated in the Results section. Non-connected pairs were not processed for morphological analysis. Therefore we cannot provide data on inter-somatic distances of non-connected simultaneously recorded cells.
