Vertebrate ALK has been considered to be an orphan receptor and the identity of the ALK ligand(s) is a critical issue. Here we show that FAM150A and FAM150B are potent ligands for human ALK that bind to the extracellular domain of ALK and in addition to activation of wild-type ALK are able to drive 'superactivation' of activated ALK mutants from neuroblastoma. In conclusion, our data show that ALK is robustly activated by the FAM150A/B ligands and provide an opportunity to develop ALK-targeted therapies in situations where ALK is overexpressed/activated or mutated in the context of the full length receptor."

Vertebrate ALK has been considered to be an orphan receptor and the identity of the ALK ligand(s) is a critical issue. Here we show that FAM150A and FAM150B are potent ligands for human ALK that bind to the extracellular domain of ALK and in addition to activation of wild-type ALK are able to drive 'superactivation' of activated ALK mutants from neuroblastoma. In conclusion, our data show that ALK is robustly activated by the FAM150A/B ligands and provide an opportunity to develop ALK-targeted therapies in situations where ALK is overexpressed/activated or mutated in the context of the full length receptor."

Therefore, in future, the development of drugs that stop FAM150A and FAM150B from binding to ALK may be useful for treating cancers that are driven by high levels of ALK activity. Many challenging questions lie ahead to better understand how FAM150A and FAM150B interact with ALK."

The identity of a ligand(s) for vertebrate ALK has been an evolving question for many years, with a number of reports over the past 15 years examining the role of the small heparin binding growth factors MDK and PTN as ligands for vertebrate ALK\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Stoica et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Stoica et al., 2002</a>). However, a number of independent studies including our own work have presented convincing evidence that MDK and PTN do not activate ALK\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Motegi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Moog-Lutz et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mourali et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Mathivet et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Hugosson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Murray et al., 2015</a>).\u00a0The recent identification of long chain heparins as activators of ALK in neuroblastoma cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">Murray et al., 2015</a>) and the interplay of this with ALK activation by FAM150A and FAM150B will require further work. FAM150A and FAM150B are very basic proteins; FAM150A has a predicted pI of 10.6, while FAM150B has one of 9.75, and we show here that FAM150A exhibits heparin binding properties, however we have not observed a cooperative role of heparin and the FAM150 ligands in ALK activation as has been described for the fibroblast growth factor receptors and FGF. Our data also suggest that FAM150 ligands can bind an ALK-LTK heterodimer complex. While the physiological significance of such an interaction is currently unclear, ALK and LTK have been reported to be coexpressed in some tissues, such as the mouse hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib30\">Weiss et al., 2012</a>), where such an interaction may be important."

In invertebrate model organisms the ALK ligands, Jeb in <i>Drosophila </i>and HEN-1 in <i>C.\u00a0elegans</i>, do not appear to resemble the FAM150A/B ligands. The <i>Drosophila</i> Jeb ligand is unable to activate either mouse or human ALK\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Yang et al., 2007</a>), and to date, no Jeb-like ligand for vertebrate ALKs has been reported.

The finding that\u00a0FAM150A and FAM150B\u00a0are not only able to activate the wild-type receptor, but also to \u2018superactivate\u2019 mutant ALK receptors, is important in this context. These findings, together with the observed expression pattern of FAM150A and FAM150B in adrenal gland and thyroid and the inhibition of ALK activation by FAM150A\u00a0with\u00a0monoclonal antibodies shown here, suggest that a future potential therapeutic arm\u00a0may involve agents that interfere with FAM150A/B activation of ALK offering additional therapeutic approaches in patients with neuroblastoma for which single drug treatments targeting ALK have had limited effect to date."

These were then further tested for their ability to interfere with the activation of ALK by FAM150A/B.

We have examined this in PC12 cells transfected with ALK as well as in NB1 and IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell lines that express WT ALK. We have been unable to show either activation of ALK by heparin alone, nor any synergistic effect of heparin together with the FAM150A/B ligands. We have tried this in cells with (i) FAM150A/B conditioned medium, (ii) purified FAM150A proteins, and additional with experiments in which cells were plated on heparin coated plates. In all cases we saw a slight inhibition of FAM150A/B activation upon addition of heparin, rather than a synergistic activation. We also examined the effect of heparin in ELISA, where there was comparable binding of FAM150A with the addition of heparin (data not shown). Some of this data is shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. Thus, at the present time we are unable to show activation of WT ALK with heparin, however, we have observed a strong interaction between the FAM150 proteins and heparin, with both FAM150A and FAM150B binding strongly to heparin-agarose (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since the FAM150A and FAM150B proteins are very basic in nature, with a predicted pI of 10.6 for FAM150A and 9.75 for FAM150B), we suspect that heparin, or heparin modified proteoglycans may be involved in the activation of ALK by FAM150 proteins. This will clearly be an important issue to clarify in the future."

One of the most studied ligand-RTK receptor pair examples is EGF-EGFR, where one published estimate is a binding affinity of 6nM (Ozcan et al., PNAS, 2006). The reviewer is correct that the affinity of ALK for the FAM150A proteins is significantly lower than for LTK. In our experiments we consistently note that FAM150B is a very strong activator and binder of ALK, and suspect that FAM150B may bind ALK very strongly. Unfortunately we have been unable to produce purified FAM150B protein and thus have not been able to directly measure affinity of the FAM150B-ALK interaction. This is something that we hope to be able to address in the future, but are currently unable to do so due to technical difficulties."

We show that both FAM150A and ALK are immunoprecipitated with LTK (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, we suggest in the revised version of the manuscript that ALK and LTK are potentially able to form a complex binding to FAM150A. Indeed, these proteins are known to be co-expressed in some neural tissues, such as the mouse hippocampus (Weiss et al., Pharmacol, Biochem Behav, 2011), and such an interaction may be of important in this context. This observation will require further studies to understand the physiological significance of such an interaction."

We are hesitant to agree that this should be noted as a deficiency of the study since very few studies show interaction of a secreted peptide ligand for a receptor tyrosine kinase through immunoprecipitation with its ligand at the level of endogenous proteins. Furthermore, while we have excellent ALK antibodies, we have no antibody that recognizes FAM150B, and our FAM150A antibodies work only on immunoblotting. Thus, while we have attempted to show endogenous interaction, we do not currently have the optimal tools to test this robustly."
