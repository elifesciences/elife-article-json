To better understand the cellular and molecular basis of the anti-inflammatory actions of apoA1, we explored the effect of acute human apoA1 exposure on the migratory capacity of monocyte-derived cells in vitro and in vivo. Acute (20\u201360 min) apoA1 treatment induced a substantial (50\u201390%) reduction in macrophage chemotaxis to a range of chemoattractants. This acute treatment was anti-inflammatory in vivo as shown by pre-treatment of monocytes prior to adoptive transfer into an on-going murine peritonitis model. We find that apoA1 rapidly disrupts membrane lipid rafts, and as a consequence, dampens the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway that coordinates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. Our data strengthen the evidence base for therapeutic apoA1 infusions in situations where reduced monocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation could have beneficial outcomes."

To better understand the cellular and molecular basis of the anti-inflammatory actions of apoA1, we explored the effect of acute human apoA1 exposure on the migratory capacity of monocyte-derived cells in vitro and in vivo. Acute (20\u201360 min) apoA1 treatment induced a substantial (50\u201390%) reduction in macrophage chemotaxis to a range of chemoattractants. This acute treatment was anti-inflammatory in vivo as shown by pre-treatment of monocytes prior to adoptive transfer into an on-going murine peritonitis model. We find that apoA1 rapidly disrupts membrane lipid rafts, and as a consequence, dampens the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway that coordinates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. Our data strengthen the evidence base for therapeutic apoA1 infusions in situations where reduced monocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation could have beneficial outcomes."

However, cholesterol can also contribute to the formation of plaques in arteries, which can lead to a disease called atherosclerosis, the cause of heart attacks. Particles called high density lipoproteins (HDL) carry cholesterol around the body in the bloodstream and are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. A protein called apoA1 is a major component of HDL particles and, acting as part of a HDL particle or alone, it removes cholesterol from cells."

The apoA1 protein removes cholesterol from lipid rafts in the membrane of the white blood cell, which changes the properties of the membrane and decreases the activity of the machinery needed for cell movement. Further experiments in mice with inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen, produced similar findings. The next step following on from this work would be to investigate whether apoA1 treatment can reduce the accumulation of white blood cells in mice that act as models of other inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis and atherosclerosis."

Postulated mechanisms include but are not limited to: (i) dependence on ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) A1, but independence of scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Murphy et al., 2008</a>); (ii) inhibition of NF-kB and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signalling (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bursill et al., 2010</a>); and (iii) increased Activator of Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) expression, which represses a subset of proinflammatory genes (<a href=\"#bib11\">De Nardo et al., 2014</a>). Notably, the bulk of studies that have shown anti-inflammatory effects of apoA1 or HDL involve relatively long-term treatment of macrophages in culture or chronic exposure in vivo\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Diederich et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bursill et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ansell et al., 2003</a>). We thought it timely to focus on the acute effects of apoA1 treatment, in both in vitro and in vivo assays of monocyte/macrophage chemotaxis, a process of fundamental importance to the initiation and amplification of inflammation. We also explored the cellular mechanisms for anti-chemotactic effects and their dependence on cholesterol efflux."

In the current study, we wanted to test whether acute exposure to the human form of apoA1 (referred to throughout as simply apoA1) could alter monocyte-derived cell chemotaxis to CC chemokines and in the process, to look for the earliest signalling events following addition of apoA1. To address this question, we used a real-time chemotaxis assay (<a href=\"#bib20\">Iqbal et al., 2013</a>). Biogel elicited murine macrophages (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup>/well) were pre-treated with apoA1 (40 \u00b5g/ml; a standard amount used in cholesterol efflux studies, e.g.<a href=\"#bib1\">Adorni et al., 2007</a>) for 60\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and allowed to migrate towards 10 nM CCL2. The representative trace in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> shows a clear reduction in chemotaxis towards CCL2 as quantified by slope and max-min analysis (67% reduction, p\u22640.01, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). A similar reduction in chemotaxis (71% reduction, p\u22640.01) was observed in response to 10 nM CCL5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). We also found that washing cells following acute exposure to apoA1 led to a similar impairment in migration as unwashed cells (data not shown). We extended our studies to show that this reduction in chemotaxis was seen with other, non-chemokine, chemoattractants: a 52% reduction in macrophage chemotaxis was observed in response to 10 nM C5a peptide (p\u22640.05, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013I</a>), and a 80% reduction in chemotaxis to 10 nM chemerin, a potent chemoattractant of antigen presenting cells (p\u22640.01, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>)."

Biogel elicited macrophages were treated for 60\u2009min with apoA1 (40 \u00b5g/ml), or vehicle prior to plating in chamber slides and stimulating cells with 10 nM CCL5. Quantitative assessment of macrophage migratory behaviour was obtained by tracking individual cells using image analysis software (representative traces shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J\u2013L</a>). Analysis revealed that macrophage migration towards CCL5 was significantly impaired (p\u22640.05) when cells were pre-treated with apoA1 as determined by the forward migration index (FMI) \u22120.090 v \u22120.012, (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1M</a>). Furthermore, treatment with apoA1 reduced the Euclidean distance and velocity of CCL5-stimulated macrophages to that of unstimulated controls, demonstrating a loss in cell directionality. Collectively, these findings support our observation that apoA1 directly impairs macrophage chemotaxis."

Given the strong inhibitory effect of apoA1 in our chemotaxis studies, we were interested to see if the effects were mediated through cholesterol efflux, and if so, whether they were dependent on the cholesterol transporter, ABCA1. Our initial experiments used a recombinant apoA1 in which the Trp72 residue has been oxidized, thereby rendering apoA1 unable to efflux cholesterol via ABCA1-mediated processes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). Notably, the migration capacity of macrophages to CCL5 treated with either recombinant wild-type apoA1 (rapoA1) or 5-OH-Trp72 rapoA1 (ox-rapoA1) was significantly inhibited (90\u201394% reduction, p\u22640.001) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>).\u00a0We further demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of apoA1 to cell migration was independent of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux by comparing the migratory ability of macrophages from C57BL/6 and <i>Abca1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. We found that macrophages from both C57BL/6 and <i>Abca1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice have an equal capacity to migrate to CCL5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), and that migration of both is inhibited by 62\u201370% (p\u22640.05\u20130.001) following treatment with apoA1 for 60\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>). Treatment of macrophages with the non-specific cholesterol depleting agent methyl \u03b2-cyclodextrin (CyD) also led to markedly reduced macrophage chemotaxis to CCL5 (91% (p\u22640.001); <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013I</a>). Taken together, these results support a role for the contribution of a cholesterol-efflux pathway, independent of ABCA1, mediating the inhibitory effect of apoA1 on macrophage chemotaxis."

We hypothesized that there was an interruption or inhibition of an aspect of chemokine signalling that regulates cell migration. In our initial studies, we found no differences in G-protein coupled receptor \u2018upstream\u2019 phenomena, such as cAMP levels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilisation or \u03b2-arrestin recruitment as a consequence of apoA1 pre-treatment (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Hence, we turned our attention to other known downstream signalling events that are essential for cytoskeletal reorganization, including PI3K and Rho/Rac (<a href=\"#bib38\">Vorotnikov, 2011</a>). Human monocytes were pre-treated with apoA1 (40 \u00b5g/ml) for 60\u2009min, prior to C5a stimulation. Pre-treatment with apoA1 reduced Akt phosphorylation by 54%, as determined by western blotting and densitometry (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). A similar significant reduction in Akt signalling was also observed following apoA1 and CyD pre-treatment of biogel elicited murine macrophages (reduction of 32% and 63% respectively, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>). In addition to Akt phosphorylation, we also measured the effects of apoA1 on its upstream activator, PI3K. Pre-treatment of RAW macrophages with apoA1 for 1\u2009hr prior to stimulation with C5a led to a reduction in PI3K activity by 36% (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), and PI3K inhibitor studies revealed significant reduction of macrophage chemotaxis in vitro (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013F</a>). Taken together, these results provide evidence that apoA1 modulates PI3K/Akt signalling resulting in a significant impairment of monocyte and macrophage chemokine-induced migration."

Pre-treatment with apoA1, rapoA1, ox-rapoA1, or CyD led to a significant reduction in total cell caveolin-1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B</a>) as determined by western blotting, and ganglioside G<sub>M1</sub> expression as determined by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) or confocal fluorescence microscopy\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013F</a>). Membrane lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol, and perturbations to this component leads to raft reorganization, which affects the activity of receptors and raft-bound signalling factors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Simons and Toomre, 2000</a>). To determine whether apoA1 reorganized cholesterol-rich domains, sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of human macrophages was performed and raft markers identified (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adorni et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Koseki et al., 2007</a>), cellular free cholesterol is distributed between both low (rafts) and high (non-rafts) density fractions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). Treatment with apoA1 (40 \u00b5g/ml), ox-rapoA1 (40 \u00b5g/ml), or CyD leads to a significant reduction in cholesterol content in both raft and non-raft fractions, demonstrating that apoA1 can significantly modulate the composition of this signalling nanodomain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I\u2013J</a>)."

A major factor that sustains inflammation in these diseases is a\u00a0mobilization and activation of the innate immune system (<a href=\"#bib36\">Tabas and Glass, 2013</a>). Chronic inflammation is characterized by the continued recruitment of circulating monocytes, in part mediated by their response to chemokines, such as CCL2 and CCL5, which are synthesized locally in response to tissue damage and resultant locally-generated inflammatory mediators (<a href=\"#bib36\">Tabas and Glass, 2013</a>). After entering the tissue, recruited monocytes become macrophages and the degree of their activation is frequently judged in vitro by the chemotactic response to chemokines. Thus, the identification and development of agents with the ability to inhibit monocyte/macrophage chemotaxis to various chemokines is an extremely active area of investigation with the ultimate goal of deploying such agents as therapeutics to combat chronic inflammatory diseases, including arthritis and atherosclerosis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Koelink et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Koenen and Weber, 2011</a>)."

Previous studies have been heavily weighted towards experimental conditions in which the assays were exclusively performed in vitro or the duration of treatment was prolonged (\u226524\u2009hr). Furthermore, the mechanistic basis for the effects on chemotaxis has been largely unexplored. In this present report, we have addressed these issues in both murine and human monocytes and macrophages in vitro and in models of inflammation in vivo. Our major findings are that: (1) only a short exposure (&lt;1\u2009hr) of monocytes or macrophages to apoA1 is required to reduce chemotaxis to chemoattractants\u00a0in vitro\u00a0and most notably, recruitment to an inflammatory site in vivo; (2) apoA1 treatment reduces both the velocity and the directionality of macrophage migration to an established chemokine gradient; (3) inhibition of monocyte-derived cell chemotaxis requires cholesterol depletion of the cells, through a mechanism independent of ABCA1, a cholesterol transporter previously invoked to explain certain anti-inflammatory effects of apoA1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Murphy et al., 2008</a>), but rather through cholesterol efflux most likely by aqueous diffusion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adorni et al., 2007</a>). We propose a model in which apoA1 and CyD treatment disrupts plasma membrane lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion, which, in turn, dampens the signalling pathway required for reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, as reflected by impaired PI3K/Akt activation. These findings will now be discussed in more detail."

This makes it difficult to discern early direct effects of apoA1 from those that are downstream and likely to include many subsequent indirect effects. For example, in Bursill <i>et al</i>., a 24\u2009hr treatment of monocytes with recombinant HDL resulted in reduced chemotaxis, and this was associated with decreased expression of CCR2 and CX3CR1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bursill et al., 2010</a>). These long-term effects are unlikely to be the basis for the observed ~80% reduction in macrophage chemotaxis following only 20\u2009min of exposure to apoA1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>). In our experiments, important \u201cupstream\u201d or \u201creceptor proximal\u201d signalling functions of chemokine G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) were not affected by acute treatment with apoA1 i.e. decreased intracellular cAMP levels (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), \u03b2-arrestin recruitment (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). In the current studies, both murine (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and human monocyte migration to CCL2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) were inhibited by apoA1 treatment. Importantly, in some chemotaxis experiments, apoA1 was removed after pre-treatment of cells, yet with even short pre-treatment times (as little as 20\u2009min) an ~80% inhibition of chemotaxis to CCL5 was still observed (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>).

As with the experiments in vitro which involve long-term incubation of cells with apoA1 or HDL, early vs. late effects cannot be discerned using this transgenic mouse model. Thus, it was especially notable that in our adoptive transfer approach, only 45\u2009min ex-vivo exposure of monocytes to apoA1 was required to reduce their recruitment to an inflammatory site by 65% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Rather, this rapid desensitization to the chemoattractant effects of chemokines likely represents the perturbation of lipid rafts, which are crucial to the common signalling machinery downstream from chemokine receptors that are required for the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and integral to chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib38\">Vorotnikov, 2011</a>). Consistent with this is our finding that incubation with apoA1 was effective in blunting chemotaxis to multiple chemokines and chemoattractants, yet the early events following receptor ligation were unimpaired (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). More directly, we show using independent assays (western blotting and flow cytometry) that lipid raft abundance was reduced after incubation of macrophages with apoA1, as was Akt phosphorylation.

Lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol and its depletion is known to change the content and function of many of its components (<a href=\"#bib34\">Simons and Toomre, 2000</a>). While it is long been appreciated that apoA1 is a major acceptor of cellular cholesterol, and therefore can affect the\u00a0lipid raft structure and functions, most studies of apoA1\u2019s anti-inflammatory effects have focused on cholesterol efflux mediated by specific membrane factors, in particular ABCA1 (e.g. <a href=\"#bib40\">Wang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Murphy et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pagler et al., 2011</a>). By multiple criteria, our results\u00a0are consistent with a non-specific cholesterol depletion process (sometimes called aqueous diffusion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adorni et al., 2007</a>) that was responsible for the impairment in chemotaxis, as: (1) similar effects of apoA1 incubation were observed with <i>Abca1</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>); (2) CyD mediated cholesterol efflux was equally effective as apoA1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J\u2013L</a>); and (3) a mutant form of apoA1 (ox-rapoA1, or 5-OH-Trp72 apoA1), which is a poor acceptor of cholesterol via ABCA1, also inhibited chemotaxis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). It should be noted that under the conditions of our assays using non-cholesterol loaded cells, ~80% of cholesterol efflux is likely through the aqueous diffusion mechanism (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adorni et al., 2007</a>), and this dominance is consistent with our results. Furthermore, that apoA1 can promote cholesterol efflux in <i>Abca1</i><sup>-/-</sup> macrophages has also been reported (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhu et al., 2008</a>). In addition, the inhibitory effect of apoA1 on macrophage chemotaxis to CCL5 is not affected by cholesterol loading of the cell (data not shown), consistent with apoA1\u2019s ability to promote cholesterol removal from membrane lipid rafts of these cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Extending the\u00a0findings from chemokine receptor knockout mice to interventional studies in man using chemokine receptor antagonists has proven challenging with multiple drugs that target single chemokine receptors failing to progress beyond early phase randomised clinical trials (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schall and Proudfoot, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Koelink et al., 2012</a>). As an alternative to targeting single macrophage chemoattractant GPCRs for therapeutic benefit, we and others have explored the potential of targeting multiple chemokines using chemokine binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib43\">White et al., 2011</a>) or blocking macrophage responses to multiple chemoattractants using netrin (<a href=\"#bib37\">van Gils et al., 2012</a>) or apoA1 (this study). The effects of netrin on macrophage chemotaxis are dependent on the Unc5b receptor while our experiments show that the effects of apoA1 occur via a receptor-independent mechanism by changing lipid raft organisation leading to decreased PI3K activity and hence decreased monocyte/macrophage adhesion, rolling and chemotaxis."

This effect was attributed, in part, to suppression of the recruitment and accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), potent stimulators of tumor growth. Notably, MDSC recruitment to tumors was significantly reduced in both apoA1 Tg mice and in apoA1-deficient mice receiving apoA1 therapy. MDSCs are comprised of a mixture of myeloid cells with granulocytic and monocytic morphology. The ability of apoA1 to suppress the recruitment of MDSCs to tumors, therefore, is in agreement with our current results showing the ability of apoA1 to suppress myeloid cell migration to inflammatory sites. While the exact molecular mechanism behind apoA1\u2019s anti-tumor effect is currently unknown, given the similarities between the results in the cancer and inflammation settings, it is likely that apoA1\u2019s ability to modulate membrane lipid raft cholesterol content influences signalling pathways regulating MDSC recruitment to tumors."

They find that apoA1 inhibits macrophage and human monocyte chemotaxis to a range of chemokine and non-chemokine ligands. Exposure of mouse bone marrow monocytes to apoA1 in vitro reduces their ability to migrate into the peritoneal cavity in response to an inflammatory stimulus after adoptive transfer. They present evidence that the mechanism of inhibition of chemotaxis is through depletion of cholesterol from lipid rafts and reduced signaling through AKT. The findings are novel and interesting and may be of significance with respect to therapeutic applications of apoA1. Overall there was general enthusiasm for this manuscript for all three reviewers. One reviewer commented, 'The findings certainly provide a new venue for the utility of acute treatment apo-A1 and functionally similar agents in preventing the pro-inflammatory effects of monocytes/macrophages recruited to sites of inflammation.' Another reviewer commented, 'This is an interesting manuscript which I enjoyed reading and which I think the readership of the journal will certainly find of interest.'"

Even a single helix is competent to mediate cholesterol efflux from cells. L-4F is a peptide with one copy of an amphipathic helix that mimics the secondary structure of apoA1\u2019s lipid-binding domain (Nagao et al., 2014). We found that treatment of biogel elicited macrophages with L-4F significantly impaired their migratory capacity to CCL2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1A</a>). As an appropriate negative control, we tested the effect of a scrambled peptide that did not contain \u03b1-helices and found that macrophage migration to CCL2 was unaltered compared to vehicle-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1A</a>). This experiment demonstrates that deleting all of the helixes would be necessary to make a truly incompetent molecule. We next considered using a C-terminal deletion mutant. This domain is the most non-polar segment of the human apoA1 molecule. Apoa1 mutants that delete all or parts of the C-terminal have a diminished ability to efflux cholesterol via ABCA-1 dependent pathways, however their ability to promote cholesterol efflux via aqueous diffusion is minimally impacted (Nagao et al., 2014, Gillotte et al., 1999). As published, using a C-terminal deletion mutant (in which amino acids 185-243 are deleted) at a concentration similar to that used in our in vitro studies, total cholesterol efflux was ~85% that of wild type apoA1 because of the presence of multiple 22-amino acid amphipathic \u03b1-helices. Not surprisingly, then, incubating macrophages with this mutant also inhibited their migration to CCL5 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1B</a>). Note that this result supports our contention that ABCA1-mediated efflux is not required for the anti-migratory effects of apoA1, consistent with 80% of cholesterol efflux in unloaded cells being mediated by the aqueous diffusion pathway (Adorni et al., 2007)."

The average concentration ratio of interstitial fluid to plasma for apoA1 is between 0.07 to 0.12 (Sloop et al., 1987). Taking into account the interstitial fluid/plasma ratio, the effective apoA1 concentration a typical cell would see in vivois approximately 176-302 \u00b5g/mL. Even in WT mice, the apoA1 plasma concentration is approximately 110 mg/dL (Rubin et al., 1991), with a typical interstitial concentration estimated to be 77-132 \u00b5g/mL. These calculations indicate that our in vitro experiments employ an apoA1 concentration well within the physiological range of that achieved not only in the transgenic, but also the WT mice, and, thus, the results are not a consequence of a pharmacologic effect of apoA1."

Cells were then homogenized in a 0.2% Triton-X 100 containing buffer prior to 5-45% sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Fractions were collected from the top (fraction 1, lightest fraction) to the bottom (fraction 10, heaviest fraction), and cholesterol content of each fraction quantified. The sums of the cholesterol content in lipid raft fractions (fractions 2-4), and non-raft fractions (fractions 8-10), are shown in panels (<b>A</b>) and (<b>B</b>) respectively.
