However, being intensiometric, AmTrac and Meptrac are limited in their use for quantitative studies. Here, we characterized the photophysical properties (steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy as well as anisotropy decay analysis) of different AmTrac sensors with diverging fluorescence properties in order to generate improved, ratiometric sensors. By replacing key amino acid residues in AmTrac we constructed a set of dual-emission AmTrac sensors named deAmTracs. deAmTracs show opposing changes of blue and green emission with almost doubled emission ratio upon ammonium addition. The response ratio of the deAmTracs correlated with transport activity in mutants with altered capacity. Our results suggest that partial disruption of distance-dependent excited-state proton transfer is important for the successful generation of single-fluorophore-based dual-emission sensors."

We recently engineered single fluorescent protein (FP)-based ammonium transport activity sensors, termed AmTrac and MepTrac, which allowed monitoring of the activity of ammonium transporters in living yeast cells by means of fluorescence intensity (FI) measurements (<a href=\"#bib7\">De Michele et al., 2013</a>). Both AmTrac and MepTrac are composed of a circularly permuted enhanced green fluorescent protein (cpEGFP) inserted into the central loop of plant or yeast AMT/MEP ammonium transporters. Quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy of yeast cells expressing the sensor variants demonstrates that they accurately report transporter activity as 30\u201350% FI decrease of green FI (<a href=\"#bib7\">De Michele et al., 2013</a>). Being based on a single FP, AmTrac and MepTrac are intensiometric, since the readout consists of FI modulations of a single wavelength. However, ratiometric signal output would be clearly advantageous for sensor calibration and reliable quantitative imaging (<a href=\"#bib14\">Tantama et al., 2012</a>). Only a few existing single FP sensors are ratiometric, displaying two emission maxima at a single excitation wavelength. The pH-sensors deGFP1 and deGFP4 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hanson et al., 2002</a>) and the calcium sensor GEM-GECO1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>) belong to this category. Based on similar steady-state fluorescence spectra of AmTrac and deGFP1 and deGFP4 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hanson et al., 2002</a>), we reasoned that it should be possible to turn AmTrac into a ratiometric, dual-emission sensor."

In AmTrac-LE, the A-state dominates the fluorescence spectrum, whereas all other AmTracs (-GS, -LS and -IS) show an equilibrium shift toward the B-state. In wild type GFP (wtGFP) (44), the A-band derives from the A-state, the protonated chromophore, while the B-state indicates the deprotonated chromophore (43). Both states are coupled by a protonation equilibrium in both wtGFP and the AmTrac sensors."

However, AmTracs are substantially different from the soluble sensors characterized so far. Membrane localization of the sensors reduces motion and mobility. Therefore, we performed time-resolved fluorescence measurements to detect if non-radiative processes such as solvent quenching or homo-FRET are involved in the sensor response. This analysis was performed for AmTrac-GS and -LE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). AmTrac-GS showed single exponential decay kinetics with lifetime values of \u03c4 = 2.55 \u00b1 0.04 ns and \u03c4 = 2.48 \u00b1 0.1 ns when treated with water and ammonium, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> top and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These values are in agreement with most reports on a single lifetime of about \u03c4 = 2.5 to 2.8 ns for EGFP in solution (<a href=\"#bib13\">Stepanenko et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arpino et al., 2012</a>). AmTrac-LE showed bi-exponential decay kinetics with fluorescence decay times of \u03c4<sub>1</sub> = 1.96 \u00b1 0.4 ns and \u03c4<sub>2</sub> = 3.98 \u00b1 0.32 ns and \u03c4<sub>1</sub> = 1.69 \u00b1 0.07 ns and \u03c4<sub>2</sub> = 3.96 \u00b1 0.17 ns when treated with water or ammonium, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> bottom and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). The two lifetime components found for AmTrac-LE are indicative of the presence of two species in the excited state. We thus conclude that the response mechanism of AmTrac-LE vs -GS differs with regard to which state (A- or B-state) is excited, and postulate that either different excited state reactions and/or different excited state species are involved. Since the lifetime values in absence and presence of ammonium differed, at most, by less than 1 ns for AmTrac-LE and -GS (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) we exclude external quenching effects due to altered solvent access in AmTracs, which is the widely accepted mechanism of single-FP sensors."

However, crystal structures have been solved for cpEGFP, as free protein or within sensors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akerboom et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Leder et al., 2010</a>) and can provide clues on how the linker residues are involved in the structural rearrangements during the sensing mechanism. The crystal structure of cpEGFP (PDB 3EVP) shows two rotamers for Glu<sup>148</sup> in close proximity to the chromophore Thr65\u2013Tyr66\u2013Gly67, which indicates a high degree of flexibility at position 148. We assume that due to re-arrangements in the cpEGFP barrel, Glu<sup>148</sup> may exist in different orientations and distances to the phenyl-group of the chromophore (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Since Glu<sup>148</sup> corresponds to Glu<sup>235</sup> in AmTrac-LE, we consider the solved structure of cpEGFP as a proxy for AmTrac-LE. Theoretical modifications of the linker sequence were performed using Pymol by replacing the linker residues LE of cpEGFP (PDB 3EVP) with GS. The result shows only one conformational state for serine of the GS linker (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) indicating more stability during conformation changes. This also indicates the impact of different amino acid linkers on the structural environment of the chromophore. We postulate that Glu<sup>235</sup> of AmTrac-LE relocates during the sensing process, most likely altering the efficiency of ESPT and in turn leading to blue and green fluorescence emission."

Therefore, we reasoned that it should be possible to generate improved dual-emission sensors with a larger ratio change compared to AmTrac-LE. We modified the left linker amino acids only, since they appeared to be involved in the dual-emission behavior. We replaced LE with two random amino acids, to check for all possible combinations, and analyzed these constructs in yeast. Out of more than 500 yeast colonies screened, we found four candidates with the new linker composition CP, FP, RP, YP that displayed distinct dual-emission patterns and two of these candidates showed improved ratios upon ammonium treatment. Interestingly, all four constructs, named deAmTracs, contained a proline residue at the linker position of the former Glu<sup>235</sup>, while the first amino acid of the linker varied (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The two candidates with the highest ratio changes, deAmTrac-CP and -FP, are described in more detail (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). deAmTrac-CP carried a cysteine and proline, while deAmTrac-FP contained phenylalanine and proline in the left linker. Upon excitation with \u03bb<sub>exc</sub> 395 nm, blue and green emission maxima at 490 nm and 515 nm, respectively, were detected, which showed opposing changes in FI upon ammonium treatment.

In deAmTrac-CP and -FP, the T464D mutation was still sufficient to block growth and response. In the T464D mutant background the presence of the suppressing mutation A141E increased the ratiometric response and transport capacity, shown as reduced growth of the mutants on high ammonium concentrations. Conversely, mutation Q61E restored growth and response of deAmTrac-T464D, although not to the full extent (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Overall, the mutations had an effect on transport activity and response similar to AmTrac-LE (<a href=\"#bib7\">De Michele et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Q61E shows the opposite effect with decreased blue and increased green emission at high ammonium concentrations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These results support the utility of deAmTracs in assessing ammonium transporter activity.

In the absence of ammonium transport activity, an efficient hydrogen bond network is established in close proximity to the chromophore, allowing for fast proton transfer from the excited state of the neutral chromophore to the final acceptor. Under these conditions, green emission from the deprotonated chromophore is observed. With increasing ammonium transport activity, the well-established ESPT pathway is partially inhibited, so that the proton cannot be efficiently transferred. Emission from the protonated intermediate is observed as blue light (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

Still, the motion is not dramatic enough to completely prevent ESPT, explaining why green emission is still observed as the dominant peak during conditions of high ammonium transport. Therefore, deAmTracs only show modest ratio changes compared to other published dual-emission sensors, possibly due to only small spatial rearrangements or averaging of the ensembles during the ammonium binding/transport process. Future efforts will address and explore alternative approaches for the design of improved ratiometric sensors for ammonium transporters."

The authors carried out additional fluorescence characterization, which revealed a prominent \u201cA-band\u201d excitation in one of the sensors. They randomly modified one of the linkers and identified several new sensors with enhanced emission in the blue spectrum in response to ammonium. The most improved sensor has nearly a two-fold change in blue to green emission in response to high ammonium. This relatively modest change compared with dual emission sensors will limit the utility of the new sensors but the study nevertheless does provide interesting new information and a theoretical proposal for the underlying mechanism. The authors propose that small linker-related perturbations of excited-state proton transfer underlie the enhancement of the blue relative to the green emission, but argue that the small conformational changes aren't sufficient to create a more dramatic shift. This is an exciting development pushing forward the technology to directly observe membrane protein transport via fluorescent methods."

From the information obtained from <a href=\"#bib7\">De Michele et al., 2013</a> we chose 3 mutations as test cases for the sensor response and coupling between activity and fluorescence response. The T464D mutation inactivates the transporter activity and, consequentially, the sensor response. Two mutations suppressed this inactivation, the high capacity mutation A141E, which we expected to increase the ratio of the response, and one of the mutations with reduced transport activity Q61E, which we expected to show a decreased response ratio (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The data not only support our hypothesis, but also the final mechanistic model in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, where low and high transport activities are correlated with ESPT."
