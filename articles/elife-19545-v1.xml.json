Here, we assess the interplay of splicing repression by hnRNPC and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in the quality control and evolution of new Alu-exons. We identify 3100 new Alu-exons and show that NMD more efficiently recognises transcripts with Alu-exons compared to other exons with premature termination codons. However, some Alu-exons escape NMD, especially when an adjacent intron is retained, highlighting the importance of concerted repression by splicing and NMD. We show that evolutionary progression of 3' splice sites is coupled with longer repressive uridine tracts. Once the 3' splice site at ancient Alu-exons reaches a stable phase, splicing repression by hnRNPC decreases, but the exons generally remain sensitive to NMD. We conclude that repressive motifs are strongest next to cryptic exons and that gradual weakening of these motifs contributes to the evolutionary emergence of new alternative exons."

Here, we assess the interplay of splicing repression by hnRNPC and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in the quality control and evolution of new Alu-exons. We identify 3100 new Alu-exons and show that NMD more efficiently recognises transcripts with Alu-exons compared to other exons with premature termination codons. However, some Alu-exons escape NMD, especially when an adjacent intron is retained, highlighting the importance of concerted repression by splicing and NMD. We show that evolutionary progression of 3' splice sites is coupled with longer repressive uridine tracts. Once the 3' splice site at ancient Alu-exons reaches a stable phase, splicing repression by hnRNPC decreases, but the exons generally remain sensitive to NMD. We conclude that repressive motifs are strongest next to cryptic exons and that gradual weakening of these motifs contributes to the evolutionary emergence of new alternative exons."

The primate-specific <i>Alu</i> elements are the second most prevalent class with almost 1.2 million copies, and thousands of them can be spliced to create Alu-exons (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lev-Maor\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sorek et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zarnack et al., 2013</a>). Only few Alu-exons encode for novel protein isoforms (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lin et al., 2016</a>), and for several, the evolutionary history of their exonisation has been described (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krull et\u00a0al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Moller-Krull et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Singer et al., 2004</a>). Alu elements are particularly prone to exonisation because as few as three single nucleotide mutations from the Alu consensus sequence are sufficient to create cryptic 5\u2019 and 3' splice sites (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lev-Maor\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sorek et al., 2004</a>), and the left-arm Alu sequence contains a CUAUU sequence that can serve as branchpoint (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mercer et al., 2015</a>). Annotated Alu-exons are usually alternatively spliced and show low inclusion levels (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sorek et\u00a0al., 2002</a>). Although it is clear that the presence of splice sites and other positive splicing elements was crucial for the emergence of Alu-exons (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lev-Maor\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sorek et al., 2004</a>), the role of repressive splice elements is less well understood. Like other types of cryptic exons, Alu-exons often contain detrimental sequences that can lead to the production of misfolded or dominant negative protein variants and are therefore associated with many human diseases (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kaneko et al., 2011</a>). Thus, it is important to understand the protective molecular mechanisms imposing constraints on the emergence and expression of Alu-exons."

Alu elements require a polyA-tail for their retrotransposition (<a href=\"#bib16\">Doucet et al., 2015</a>), and therefore, when they insert into other genes in an antisense orientation, they start with a polyuridine tract (U-tract). Moreover, these antisense Alu elements often contain cryptic splice sites (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lev-Maor\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003</a>). While U-tracts can allow 3' splice site recognition in vitro (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouck\u00a0et\u00a0al., 1998</a>), we previously showed that the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (hnRNPC) binds these U-tracts in vivo to block recruitment of the spliceosomal factor U2 auxiliary factor 65 kDa subunit (U2AF2, also U2AF65). In principle, it is plausible that other proteins with known preference for U-rich motifs (e.g. HuR, TIA, TDP43) also bind the Alu U-tract and repress Alu exonisation; and indeed HuR and TDP43 show enriched binding at antisense Alu elements (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kelley et al., 2014</a>). Yet, depletion experiments for TDP43, TIA, HuR, PTB and hnRNPA1 did not show increased Alu-exon inclusion in their absence (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zarnack et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kelley et al., 2014</a>). Thus, the U-tract:hnRNPC interaction is crucial to prevent the splicing machinery from accessing cryptic splice sites at Alu-exons."

However, the total number of Alu-exons regulated by hnRNPC is likely to be even larger, since Alu-exon-containing transcripts (Alu-exon transcripts) may evade detection if they are unstable. For instance, the\u00a0presence of inverted Alu repeats within 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) causes nuclear retention (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen and Carmichael, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, most Alu-exons will introduce a premature termination codon (PTC) into the transcript, and Alu-exon transcripts are therefore likely to be targeted by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)."

This identified 3101 new Alu-exons that are normally repressed by one or both pathways in wild-type cells. Upon hnRNPC but not UPF1 depletion, many Alu-exons are included together with flanking intronic sequences. Surprisingly, these intron-retaining Alu transcripts are generally resistant to NMD, even though they harbour PTCs, are exported to the cytoplasm and found in association with polysomes. Analysing the evolutionary paths towards exonisation, we find that evolutionary emergence of a stronger 3' splice site in an exonising Alu element is coupled with a\u00a0longer repressive U-tract. At the same time, splicing repression by hnRNPC is decreased at ancient Alu elements, while they remain sensitive to NMD. We conclude that Alu-exon formation proceeds through distinct evolutionary stages that rely on complementary repressive mechanisms."

In the UCSC gene annotation,\u00a02,657 Alu-exons are present (human genome version GRCh37/hg19),\u00a0for which at least one of the splice sites originates from an Alu element. However, this is a relatively small number, given that Alu elements constitute 12.2% of the intronic sequence of protein-coding genes. In contrast, only 4% of exonic sequence derives from Alu elements. Notably, the contribution of Alu element sequences is less than 0.6% in constitutive exons, indicating a strong bias towards alternative inclusion of Alu-exons.

Differences in the distribution were tested by an ANOVA design, for details see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods. (<b>B</b>) RNAseq data of cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA from HR1 cells transfected with siRNAs against hnRNPC (siC #1 and #2) or controls (\u2018no siRNA\u2019: mock transfection; ctrl: unspecific control oligonucleotide) was used to test if inclusion of Alu-exons impacts on gene expression. Protein-coding genes with or without cryptic, alternative or constitutive Alu-exons were grouped, considering only Alu-exons with sufficient coverage (minimal five reads/million including one junction-spanning read; 550 Alu-exons). Shown is the distribution of expression fold changes (log<sub>2</sub>). To estimate the\u00a0expression fold changes, we compared cells depleted of hnRNPC (siC #1 and #2) against controls (no siRNA and control oligonucleotide) using DESeq (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anders and Huber, 2010</a>). Differences between Alu-exon gene abundance across groups were tested by Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test within each RNA fraction (cytoplasmic RNA, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.01819; nuclear RNA, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.3646). Indicated pairwise comparisons were tested with a two-sided Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. ** indicates p-value\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01. (<b>C</b>) RNA expression levels of 12 Alu-exon genes identified from the cytoplasmic and/or nuclear RNAseq datasets. Loss of transcripts from Alu-exon genes in hnRNPC-depleted cells was generally restricted to cytoplasmic RNA. Gene expression was quantified by quantitative RT-PCR from HR1 cells transfected with siRNAs against hnRNPC (siC #1 and #2) or controls (\u2018no siRNA\u2019: mock transfection; ctrl: unspecific control oligonucleotide), error bars represent standard deviation of the mean (s.d.m.; n\u00a0=\u00a03 or 4). <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> shows the expression of Alu-exon genes in the individual tissues, which is summarised in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> provides quality control on the nuclear-cytoplasmic fractions by Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR. <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a> presents semi-quantitative RT-PCR quantifications of individual Alu-exon transcripts compared to the Alu-exon-free transcripts.

Cryptic Alu-exons are not included in the presence of hnRNPC, since splicing of Alu-exons is strongly repressed by hnRNPC (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zarnack et al., 2013</a>). Hence, we set up hnRNPC depletion experiments, in which we obtained robust depletion of hnRNPC within 48 hr after transfection of two independent siRNAs (siC #1 and siC #2, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), and biochemically separated cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bhatt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">B\u00fchler\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2002</a>).

We performed these experiments in HR1 cells, a HEK293 derivate with a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT)-inducible RAF1 kinase transgene allowing robust activation of the ERK MAPK pathway in less than 30 min (see below; <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">Ewings et al., 2007</a>).

Moreover, cryptic Alu-exons were associated with decreased expression only in cytoplasmic but not nuclear RNA. We used qPCR to validate the cytoplasmic loss of expression for nine out of nine well-expressed Alu-exon genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We also validated the expression of three Alu-exon genes for which we did not detect hnRNPC-mediated changes in our RNAseq data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), presumably due to low inclusion levels (<i>NUP160, TNPO3</i>) or positioning of the Alu-exon in the 5\u2019 UTR (<i>PP2R1B</i>). Finally, we used semi-quantitative RT-PCR to monitor the relative abundance of the transcript isoforms containing the Alu-exon (Alu-exon transcripts). For two out of four genes (<i>AGL, TIMM23</i>), the Alu-exon transcripts were less abundant in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and <i>NUP133</i> showed more complex splicing patterns (see below). In summary, we conclude that the inclusion of Alu-exons followed by cytoplasmic loss of the Alu-exon transcripts frequently leads to reduced gene expression in response to hnRNPC depletion."

However, we did not observe any change in the cytoplasmic nor nuclear mRNA content upon depletion of hnRNPC (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). Within our time-course of 4-HT induction, hnRNPC depletion did not change the kinetics of cytoplasmic mRNA accumulation of the ERK-induced genes <i>FOS</i>, <i>ERG2</i> and <i>NDRG1</i> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Saito et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). Moreover, the vast majority of Alu-exon and other genes did not show an expression pattern suggestive of an mRNA export block (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>), nor did we detect an increased nuclear accumulation of mature RNAs in dependence of hnRNPC (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>). Hence, we observed neither a general nor an Alu-exon associated role of hnRNPC in mRNA export in our experiments. We therefore conclude that the cytoplasmic loss of Alu-exon transcripts under hnRNPC knockdown conditions in our study does not result from a nuclear export block, but instead might reflect their cytoplasmic degradation."

This strongly suggests that NMD is involved in the cytoplasmic loss of Alu-exon transcripts and that hnRNPC-mediated splicing repression and NMD act together to repress Alu-exon expression. Indeed, changes in exon abundance analysed by DEXSeq (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anders et al., 2012</a>) showed that depletion of either hnRNPC or UPF1 alone resulted in increased Alu-exon abundance and that co-depletion of both factors showed a synergistic effect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Almost 85% of the shared-target Alu-exons are within the CDS, compared to only 35% of the non-regulated Alu-exons, suggesting that repression of Alu-exons is particularly important within the CDS. Of 175 shared-target Alu-exons within the CDS, 65% introduce a PTC and additional 21% a frame-shift, underlining their potentially deleterious impact. However, we were surprised to find similar PTC+ proportions among the hnRNPC-specific target exons in the CDS that are refractory to NMD (56% with PTC plus additional 24% with a frame-shift). This suggested that many PTC-containing Alu-exons escape quality control by NMD. As a control, we repeated the analysis for all non-Alu-exons and found that 7.8% of PTC+ transcripts were classified as NMD-sensitive. This is consistent with the previous finding that 9% of PTC+ transcripts were experimentally validated as NMD targets (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lareau et al., 2007</a>), highlighting the difficulty of accurately predicting the recognition of PTCs by the NMD pathway. Given that\u00a0~40% of Alu-exon PTC+ isoforms are NMD-sensitive, Alu-exons are more efficient in eliciting NMD compared to other exons. This indicates that mechanisms may exist that protect other PTC+ exons from being recognised by the NMD pathway."

                                "text": "It was previously discovered that efficient NMD in mammalian cells requires the PTC to be at a distance of at least 55 nucleotides (nt) from the downstream exon-exon junction(s) in order to allow the exon junction complex (EJC) to recruit UPF1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Le Hir et al., 2000</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">Nagy and Maquat, 1998</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib57\">Thermann et al., 1998</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib26\">Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012</a>). To test whether the 55-nt rule explains the NMD-refractory PTC+ exons, we focussed on Alu-exons that were supported by junction-spanning reads on either side (798 exons) to ensure that the distance of the PTC to the next exon-exon junction is accurately defined. In line with the 55-nt rule, we found that in Alu-exons and all other types of alternative exons, PTCs are more frequently located less than 55 nt from the next exon-exon junction in NMD-refractory than in NMD-sensitive exons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Nevertheless, only one-third of the NMD-refractory Alu-exons can be explained by a short distance of the PTC to the next exon-exon junction. Moreover, most NMD-refractory Alu-exons with a PTC within less than 55 nt from the exon-exon junction still have additional junctions downstream (20 out of 29 Alu-exons), suggesting that EJCs deposited further downstream may not be able to activate NMD."

While NMD accounts for the diminished expression of Alu-exon genes in hnRNPC-depleted cells, a substantial number of PTC+ Alu-exons is not cleared by the NMD pathway. Notably, two-third of these NMD-refractory Alu-exons cannot be explained by the 55-nt rule, suggesting that additional mechanisms might be involved in controlling NMD sensitivity."

Using a modified DEXSeq approach to monitor intron events, we found retention of introns upstream or downstream of an Alu-exon for\u00a0~10% of Alu-exons in at least one of the tested conditions, including 40 cases of significant retention of both introns (adjusted p-value\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). All transcripts also include the Alu-exon sequence and are therefore referred to as \u2018intron-retaining Alu transcripts\u2019. The Alu-exons in these intron-retaining Alu transcripts have weaker 5' and 3' splice sites (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), indicating that intron retention might be a by-product of inefficient Alu exonisation. We did not observe intron in the majority of genes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) or a preference for retention of distal introns in Alu-exon genes compared to other genes (p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.2202, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> test).

Hence, intron retention in hnRNPC-depleted cells is significantly associated with Alu-exons.

However, we found that the intron-retaining Alu transcripts of <i>NUP133</i> and <i>MCM3</i> are readily detectable in cytoplasmic RNA (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Only the introns flanking the Alu-exon, but no other introns of the same transcripts are found in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We did not observe accumulation of unspliced RNA in the nucleus for genes with intron-retaining Alu transcripts (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>), and thus, we found no evidence for reduced nuclear export of those transcripts. Intriguingly, the abundance of intron-retaining Alu transcripts was unchanged in UPF1-depleted cells, suggesting that they are resistant to NMD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). This is in spite of the fact that the corresponding Alu-exon transcripts, which include only the Alu-exon itself, are subject to NMD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Thus, the intron-retaining Alu transcripts appear to harbour certain features enabling them to evade NMD."

Since PTC detection via NMD relies on translation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Trcek et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Singh et al., 2007</a>), translational inhibition could explain such NMD-refractory events. We therefore used polysome sedimentation experiments (polysome profiling) to test whether the NMD-refractory transcripts are associated with polysomes. To this end, we extracted untranslated ribosome-free RNA and 80S-associated RNA as well as RNA associated with 1\u20134 or more ribosomes (polysome fractions, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that the intron-retaining Alu transcripts of <i>NUP133</i> as well as the NMD-refractory Alu-exon transcripts of <i>TNPO3</i> and <i>ZFX</i> are present in the polysome fractions, indicating that they might be translated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). In summary, our data indicate that inclusion of intronic sequences flanking Alu-exons protects the resulting transcripts from NMD. It remains to be seen which elements are required for protection from NMD."

For example, the exonising Alu element in the <i>REL</i> gene (in the past called <i>c-rel-2</i>) obtained a 5\u2019 splice site only after the split of Old and New World monkeys (in the catarrhini lineage), even though the Alu element itself is present in both groups."

To understand how the interplay of positive and negative regulatory elements contributed to the formation of Alu-exons, we examined U-tract length and splice site strength in Alu-exons across the human as well as four primate genomes. First, we classified Alu-exons by sequence divergence (determined by the number of mutations from the Alu consensus sequence), which reflects the mutational load of an Alu element since its integration and is thus an approximate measure of evolutionary age (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deininger\u00a0and\u00a0Batzer, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Smit, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">dos Reis et al., 2016</a>). With increased sequence divergence, 3' splice site strength increases, while 5' splice site strength shows little variability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In the oldest Alu-exons, the optimised 3' splice sites are accompanied by shorter U-tracts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), which leads to reduced repression by hnRNPC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In contrast, emerging Alu-exons do not seem to be under selective pressure to escape NMD, since around half of them introduce a PTC or frame-shift irrespective of the divergence of the underlying Alu element (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Together, this indicated that Alu-exons eventually escape strong hnRNPC repression by accumulating mutations that shorten their U-tracts."

Moreover, we also examined the maximum difference in exon inclusion across tissues to identify tissues-specific exons with a switch-like capacity (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). With increasing age, Alu-exons tend to be more frequently alternatively spliced between tissues (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Since these split at different points from the human lineage, the\u00a0presence of splice site sequences in other primates acts as an independent qualitative\u00a0measure of evolutionary age. Based on our initial observation that 3' splice site optimisation is a crucial factor in Alu-exon evolution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), we classified the Alu-exons according to the evolutionary emergence of their 3' splice site. We considered 2876 Alu-exons that contain a 3' splice site with a score greater than three in human (predicted maximum entropy based on nucleotide sequence, <a href=\"#bib69\">Yeo and Burge, 2004</a>), and for which the orthologous position could be found in at least one of the four primate species (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We further classified these Alu-exons according to whether the cryptic 3' splice site is present in Old World and New World monkeys (based on the marmoset genome, 47% of exons), only in Old World monkeys (based on the rhesus macaque genome, 39% of exons), or only in the hominoidae lineage (gibbon or chimpanzee, 14%). The Alu-exons with a cryptic 3' splice site early in evolution had shorter U-tracts compared to those where it emerged later. Comparing substitution rates cross-confirmed that those were the most ancient Alu-exons (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The median U-tract length is 10 nt for Alu elements present in Old and New World monkeys (10\u201311 nt, 95% confidence interval [ci]), 11 nt for those specific for Old World monkeys (ci: 10\u201312 nt), 13 nt for those specific for hominidae (ci: 12\u201315 nt). Thus, the classifications based on either Alu element divergence in the human genome (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) or on evolutionary emergence of a 3' splice site demonstrate that ancient Alu-exons have shorter U-tracts."

The remaining Alu-exons were further divided into those that lacked a 3' splice site in the most distant species (\u2018emerging exons\u2019, 26.6%), and those with an existing 3' splice site that further increased in strength towards the human lineage (\u2018evolving exons\u2019, 25.6%).

(<b>A</b>) As\u00a0the strength of 3' splice sites increases, the\u00a0repressive U-tracts\u00a0are\u00a0lengthened, which recruits hnRNPC\u00a0to prevent splicing of Alu-exons. Hence, the splice site sequence and the repressive U-tract undergo an evolutionary dynamic that we refer to as regulatory co-evolution. Splice site sequences without a nearby repressive element are depleted, likely due to strong negative selection. Selection pressure for long U-tracts decreased for as-yet unknown reasons\u00a0at the\u00a0more ancient Alu-exons (those that contain a splice site in a distant primate species, or their sequence\u00a0diverges\u00a0from the\u00a0Alu\u00a0consensus), and these exons are less repressed by\u00a0hnRNPC and have an increased incidence of tissue-specific splicing. At this stage, abundance of the Alu-exon\u00a0isoform is\u00a0determined also\u00a0by its ability to trigger NMD, and likely other factors such as tissue-specific splicing factors.

Most human\u00a0Alu-exons have stronger 3' splice sites in human compared to New World monkeys, and these exons also have longer repressive U-tracts\u00a0in\u00a0human. These exons are split according to the evolutionary trajectory of their 3' splice site sequence into emerging, evolving or stable 3' splice sites. The most ancient Alu-exons, which have a strong and stable 3' splice site, lack any trend towards longer U-tracts. This demonstrates that tight coupling between positive and negative splicing elements establishes a balanced regulatory environment at the\u00a0newly\u00a0emerging exons."

They present a major challenge to splicing fidelity but also open an opportunity for the emergence of new exons during evolution (<a href=\"#bib61\">Ule, 2013</a>). Our study uncovers many new cryptic Alu-exons, raising the number of exonising Alu elements to over 6300. We demonstrate that splicing repression and NMD cooperatively control these exons to prevent the accumulation of potentially aberrant Alu-exon transcripts. U-tracts are longest in evolutionarily young Alu-exons, which leads to strong splicing repression by hnRNPC. Selection pressure for long U-tracts is strongest in Alu elements that show progressively stronger 3' splice sites when comparing orthologous Alu sequences of other primates to human. We speculate that splicing repression by hnRNPC serves as a molecular buffer during 3' splice site evolution at Alu elements, which allows the cryptic Alu-exons to undergo a stage of regulatory co-evolution before forming <i>bona fide</i> alternative exons. NMD targets Alu-exons to a similar extent irrespective of their evolutionary age, indicating that NMD is either tolerated or even beneficial to regulate the expression of Alu-exon transcripts. Notably, we find that NMD is inefficient in targeting intron-retaining Alu transcripts, highlighting the need for strong splicing repression to protect the transcriptome."

As a result, many transcripts that are normally degraded by NMD become upregulated under these conditions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gardner, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lou et al., 2016</a>). Since we observed that many Alu-exons promote NMD, we speculate that Alu-exons could have shaped the primate- and species-specific regulation of mRNA decay in response to variable efficiency of NMD. Potential PTCs remain relatively common in the highly divergent Alu-exons, and we observed that increased inclusion of Alu-exons often leads to NMD-dependent reduced expression levels. This suggests that most exonising Alu elements have not yet evolved to evade NMD. This could either be because selection pressure to remove PTCs is weak, or because the presence of the PTCs is of functional significance. While speculative, the later explanation has precedence: The Alu-derived alternative exon 10 in the gene <i>CD55</i> is NMD-sensitive (our study) and causes a frame-shift, thereby generating a secreted CD55 protein isoform that is required for regulation of the complement cascade (<a href=\"#bib44\">Osuka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Caras et al., 1987</a>). This example illustrates a scenario that might be common for established Alu-exons: they provide an opportunity to evolve novel protein sequences, but at the cost of reduced gene expression due to a residual sensitivity to NMD."

Yet, only\u00a0~8% of annotated exons with a PTC undergo detectable NMD (our study and <a href=\"#bib40\">McIlwain et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that other exons with PTCs are more efficient in evading NMD than cryptic Alu-exons. Our analyses confirm previous findings that a PTC further than 55 nt from a downstream EJC is not sufficient to reliably predict NMD substrates (<a href=\"#bib40\">McIlwain et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lindeboom et al., 2016</a>). A major finding of our study are over 300 transcripts, in which intronic sequences flanking an Alu-exon are retained. These intron-retaining Alu transcripts evade recognition by NMD despite the fact that they accumulate in the cytoplasm. This is unexpected since past studies found that intron retention usually triggers either nuclear retention or NMD, separate mechanisms that are also exploited for specific regulation, e.g. to downregulate genes during cellular differentiation (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yap et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Braunschweig et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wong et al., 2013</a>). It is even more surprising since the corresponding Alu-exon transcripts are efficiently degraded by NMD, even though the intron-retaining Alu transcripts often contain more PTCs in their open reading frame than the Alu-exon transcripts. We observed that NMD-resistant Alu-exon transcripts of <i>TNPO3</i> and <i>ZFX</i> as well as the intron-retaining Alu transcript of <i>NUP133</i> are associated with polysomes in a similar ratio as the conventionally spliced transcripts. Yet, more tests will be needed to address whether the same applies to the multitude of intron transcripts observed in cells depleted of hnRNPC. Moreover, it will be exciting to see whether the polysome-associated intron transcripts are indeed being translated, for instance by mining deep proteomics data collected from hnRNPC-depleted cells."

Firstly, the retained intronic sequences are usually longer than regular exons, likely resulting in an increased distance between any PTC and the next EJC. Secondly, splicing factors could remain bound on the retained introns and may prevent EJC assembly. Thirdly, it is tempting to speculate that the retained introns may contain NMD-inhibitory sequences. A recent study described NMD-inhibitory, AU-rich sequences in some 3' UTRs, which are sufficient to block NMD in heterologous reporters (<a href=\"#bib58\">Toma et al., 2015</a>). Since introns generally show a higher A/U content than exonic sequences or Alu elements (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amit et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Louie et\u00a0al., 2003</a>), AU-rich or other sequence elements in the intron-retaining Alu transcripts may allow them to evade NMD. Finally, we can not formally exclude that intron-retaining Alu transcripts are sequestered and at the same time degraded in the nucleus, which could partly contribute to their reduced gene expression. Further studies of NMD-inhibitory\u00a0sequences may help to understand why so many PTC+ transcripts evade NMD."

Interestingly, Alu-exons with\u00a0stable 3' splice site across primate species show an average U-tract length of 8\u201310 uridines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u00a0and B</a>), which is at the lower limit of 9 to 10 uridines necessary to allow cooperative binding by the two RRMs of hnRNPC (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cienikov\u00e1 et al., 2015</a>). We propose that a cryptic 3' splice site is best tolerated within an Alu element that already contains a long U-tract, while emergence of the same site in the absence of a long U-tract is subject to negative selection. Consistent with this hypothesis, it was proposed that low inclusion of newly emerging exons is required to reduce negative selection against them (<a href=\"#bib67\">Xing and Lee, 2006</a>). However, since only a limited number of primate genomes are analysed, we might miss short periods of rapid evolution. It remains possible that an unrepressed strong 3' splice site can be tolerated within an Alu element but is commonly followed by a period of U-tract lengthening due to strong positive selection against inclusion of the Alu-exon. While we cannot fully distinguish between scenarios of negative and positive selection, it is clear that long U-tracts are selected as balancing elements at splice sites increasing in strength due to random genomic drift. Repression by the hnRNPC:U-tract interaction prevents abrupt increases in Alu-exon inclusion at strengthening 3' splice sites, which could otherwise disrupt gene expression due to NMD or produce toxic proteins."

Notably, this \u2018regulatory co-evolution\u2019 takes place while the Alu-exons are still in a cryptic state, before they acquire any functions. Regulatory co-evolution may act to ensure a more gradual evolutionary path at emerging exons in general, and represent a crucial step in the emergence of new splice site sequences. Co-evolution of positive and negative splice elements has already been described at a set of constitutively included exons (<a href=\"#bib66\">Xiao et al., 2009</a>). Burge and colleagues proposed that intronic G-tracts attract hnRNPH at 5\u2019 splice sites to enhance exons with intermediate-strength 5\u2019 splice sites, and thus act as \u2018genetic buffers\u2019 at constitutive exons with mutations that weaken the 5\u2019 splice site sequence. This illustrates that regulatory co-evolution describes a dynamic process in which evolving splice sites sequences are coupled to regulatory RBP\u00a0binding sites, in order to maintain a stable level of exon recognition. This process can thus either maintain exons in a cryptic state (in the case of U-tracts at Alu-exons), or in a constitutive state (in the case of G-tracts)."

While repressed through its U-tract, a cryptic exon might acquire mutations that decrease its toxicity, thus gradually decreasing the selection pressure for the repressive elements. However, it might be far more likely that the regulatory elements diversify. If new sequence elements recruit repressors other than hnRNPC, which are not ubiquitously expressed, they could establish tissue-specific regulation of individual exons. This would also reduce negative selection, since cell-type-specific expression will mitigate the impact of a single exon on a multi-cellular organism. We favour this scenario, since we observed both an increase in maximum inclusion of an Alu-exon with increased Alu-exon age, and a trend towards a switch-like inclusion in individual tissues. We were\u00a0not able to identify other splicing regulators competing with hnRNPC by iCLIP binding patterns (data not shown, and <a href=\"#bib25\">Kelley et al., 2014</a>). Hence, such a scenario remains hypothetical, since no tissue-specific splicing repressor is yet known to regulate inclusion of Alu-exons in a pronounced manner. Since it is likely that each tissue-specific Alu-exon is regulated by a unique combination of RBPs, it will require further studies to fully unravel these more complex regulatory networks."

However, the large number of these cryptic Alu-exons exposes them to germline or somatic mutations that could disrupt the repressive U-tracts, thus leading to inclusion of potentially deleterious exons. We therefore propose that the cryptic Alu-exons reported in our study could be considered for interpretation of whole-genome sequencing studies that aim to discover new disease-causing mutations. Unravelling the coupling of negative and positive splicing elements at cryptic exons would thus help to understand how mutations within the vast intronic regions of our genes cause disease."

Analysis of sequence divergence is shown for Alu-exons that were supported by junction-spanning reads on both sides in our RNAseq data (798 exons), which accurately identified the splice site positions. To classify Alu elements by their evolutionary dynamics, we started with the complete set of 6309 non-overlapping Alu-exons but only examined human Alu-exons that had a 3' splice site sequence (3' SS) with a predicted strength higher than 3, to narrow down to Alu-exons which have acquired a 3' splice site sequence in human. We then used the UCSC Genome Browser LiftOver tool (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rosenbloom et al., 2015</a>) to obtain orthologous genomic loci of the 3' splice site of human Alu elements in the representative species for New World monkeys (marmoset, calJac3), Old World monkeys (rhesus macaque, rheMac3) and hominidae (gibbon, nomLeu1 and chimpanzee, panTro4) lineages. We first classified each Alu element based on the most distant species to which we could lift over its genome coordinates. We then collected the sequence 20 nt upstream to 3 nt downstream of the 3' SS\u00a0for each species, and examined the maximum entropy of its sequence with MaxEntScan (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yeo and Burge, 2004</a>)."

Extending their previous work published in Cell demonstrating that hnRNPC has a widespread role in silencing Alu exons through binding to adjacent, cryptic 3\u00b4splice site polyU-tracts, the authors now show that nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) can additionally act to suppress Alu exonization in a subset of transcripts, some of which are also suppressed by hnRNPC. However, a substantial proportion of Alu exon-containing transcripts that are predicted to be substrates for NMD do not appear to be targeted by this process, and many of these Alu exons are found adjacent to retained introns. The authors further show that ancient Alu exons are typified by having polyU tracts of reduced length but may often be associated with NMD activity, as supported by the observation that these transcripts have relatively reduced expression levels across human tissues."

Differentially expressed transcripts are enriched for Alu-exons and there is an overall trend for down-regulation of cytoplasmic mRNA expression of genes that harbour these exons, which is validated for a subset of genes using RT-(q)PCR assays. However, hnRNPC depletion leads to differential expression of a large number of genes that lack Alu exons, indicating a more widespread role for hnRNPC in regulating steady-state mRNA levels independent of the presence of Alu-exons. To strengthen the conclusion that reduction in gene expression is specifically caused by increased Alu exon inclusion upon hnRNPC knockdown, rather than through alternative mechanisms, it would be useful to separately assess differential expression levels for those genes that contain cryptic, alternative, or constitutive Alu exons, where genes in the latter group should not be affected. Similarly, the authors should test whether there is a significant negative correlation between increased Alu exon inclusion and expression. This could be assessed in the UPF1-knockdown data where changes in splicing can be more accurately monitored."

The authors next show evidence that a significant fraction of these transcripts contain retained introns adjacent to the Alu-exons. They conclude that Alu-exon transcripts containing intron retention events can be readily exported and translated in the cytoplasm. However, their interpretation is based on RT-(q)PCR analysis of only a few transcripts, whereas it is unclear whether it applies more generally."

It is therefore recommended that the authors globally assess changes in the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios of transcripts that include Alu-exons, with or without one or both adjacent retained introns, upon hnRNPC knockdown, using reads that span exon-intron junctions. While the authors' data may not be consistent with a \"block\" to nuclear RNA export that results in nuclear accumulation of Alu-exon transcripts as they claim, it is possible that intron retention in these transcripts leads to nuclear sequestration and subsequent nuclear turnover, and that such effects could in turn lead to reduced cytoplasmic levels of Alu-exon transcripts."

To what extent can the authors conclude that the U-tracts are functioning through hnRNP C versus altered recruitment of U2AF65 (further strengthening the splice sites), and/or allowing buffering by other U-tract binding hnRNP-like proteins (e.g. TIA). Some of the concern regarding the specificity of hnRNP C function is addressed by the author's earlier work, but it would be helpful to clarify this point in the text."

We agree that it is possible that lowly expressed genes could show less negative selection against Alu-exonisation events, which would make them appear more tolerant. However, this also implies that Alu-exonisation is detrimental to gene expression levels. If we assume highly expressed genes are not tolerant to Alu-exonisation, but lowly expressed genes are, this would indicate a negative selection acting on highly expressed genes. This is presumably because Alu-exonisation events hamper expression or function of those genes, and high/robust gene expression is more frequently associated with essential cellular or tissue-specific function (1, 2).

Instead, we used all reads within introns of a gene and all exon-exon junction reads und assessed the ratio of spliced to unspliced transcripts. We separated non-Alu-exons genes versus Alu-exon genes with or without significant amounts of Alu-associated intron transcripts. Within the nuclear RNAseq data set, we find no appreciable accumulation of unspliced RNA (vs spliced transcripts) in either group upon hnRNPC depletion. Together with our more extensive RT-PCR evidence that the intron-retained Alu transcripts of NUP133, GMPS and MCM3 are by large not retained in the nucleus, we believe that this argues against a general bias of alternatively spliced transcripts to be sequestered in the nucleus."
