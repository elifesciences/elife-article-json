The chemical reactions that make up photosynthesis are powered by a chain of enzymes, and plants must ensure that these enzymes\u2014which are in the leaves of the plant\u2014are supplied with enough carbon dioxide and water. Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere enters plants through pores in their leaves, but water must be carried up the plant from the roots."

Under these circumstances this causes problems because RuBisCO uses oxygen to break down RuBP, instead of creating sugars, when carbon dioxide is not readily available. To prevent this process, which wastes a lot of energy and resources, some plants\u2014including maize, sugar cane and many other agricultural staples\u2014have evolved an alternative process called C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Although it is more complex than C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis, and required many changes to be made to the structure of leaves, C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis has evolved on more than 60 different occasions."

To avoid carbon dioxide being captured by both enzymes, C<sub>4</sub> plants evolved to relocate RuBisCO from the mesophyll to a second set of cells in an airtight structure known as the bundle sheath. The four-carbon acids produced by PEPC diffuse to the cells in the bundle sheath, where they are broken down into carbon dioxide molecules, and photosynthesis then proceeds as normal. This process allows photosynthesis to continue when the level of carbon dioxide in the leave is low because the plant has closed its pores to retain water."

This involved investigating the prevalence of 16 traits that are common to C<sub>4</sub> plants in a total of 73 species that undergo C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (including 37 species that possess characteristics of both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub>)."

While the polyphyletic origin of simple traits (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hill et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Steiner et al., 2009</a>) is underpinned by flexibility in the underlying molecular mechanisms, the extent to which this applies to complex traits is less clear. C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is both highly complex, involving alterations to leaf anatomy, cellular ultrastructure, and photosynthetic metabolism, and also convergent, being found in at least 60 independent lineages of angiosperms (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sage et al., 2011a</a>). As the emergence of the entire C<sub>4</sub> phenotype cannot be comprehensively explored experimentally, C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is an ideal system for the mathematical modelling of complex trait evolution as transitions on an underlying phenotype landscape. Furthermore, understanding the evolutionary events that have generated C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis on many independent occasions has the potential to inform approaches being undertaken to engineer C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into C<sub>3</sub> crop species (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hibberd et al., 2008</a>)."

C<sub>4</sub> species have since radiated to represent the most productive crops and native vegetation on the planet because modifications to their leaves increase the efficiency of photosynthesis in the sub-tropics and tropics (<a href=\"#bib19\">Edwards et al., 2010</a>). In C<sub>4</sub> plants, photosynthetic efficiency is improved compared with C<sub>3</sub> species because significant alterations to leaf anatomy, cell biology and biochemistry lead to higher concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> around the primary carboxylase RuBisCO <a href=\"#bib71\">Slack and Hatch, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Langdale, 2011</a>). The morphology of C<sub>4</sub> leaves is typically modified into so-called Kranz anatomy that consists of repeating units of vein, bundle sheath (BS) and mesophyll (M) cells (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hattersley, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Langdale, 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Photosynthetic metabolism becomes modified and compartmentalised between the M and BS, with M cells lacking RuBisCO but instead containing high activities of the alternate carboxylase PEPC to generate C<sub>4</sub> acids. The diffusion of these acids followed by their decarboxylation in BS cells around RuBisCO increases CO<sub>2</sub> supply and therefore photosynthetic efficiency (<a href=\"#bib89\">Zhu et al., 2008</a>). C<sub>4</sub> acids are decarboxylated by at least one of three enzymes within BS cells: NADP- or NAD-dependent malic enzymes (NADP-ME or NAD-ME respectively), or phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hatch et al., 1975</a>). Specific lineages of C<sub>4</sub> species have typically been classified into one of three sub-types, based on the activity of these decarboxylases, as well as anatomical and cellular traits that consistently correlate with each other (<a href=\"#bib20\">Furbank, 2011</a>)."

Phylogenetically independent lineages of C<sub>4</sub> plants have co-opted homologous mechanisms to generate cell specificity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2011</a>) as well as the altered allosteric regulation of C<sub>4</sub> enzymes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Christin et al., 2007</a>) indicating that parallel evolution underpins at least part of the convergent C<sub>4</sub> syndrome. However, while a substantial amount of work has addressed the molecular alterations that generate the biochemical differences between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants (<a href=\"#bib84\">Williams et al., 2012</a>) much less is known about the order and flexibility with which phenotypic traits important for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis are acquired (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sage et al., 2012</a>). Clues to this question exist in the form of C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> intermediates, species exhibiting characteristics of both C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, such as the activity or localisation of C<sub>4</sub> cycle enzymes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hattersley and Stone, 1986</a>), the possession of one or more anatomical or cellular adaptations associated with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib53\">Moore et al., 1987</a>), or combinations of both (e.g., <a href=\"#bib38\">Kennedy et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kotayeva et al., 2010</a>). To address these unknown aspects of C<sub>4</sub> evolutionary history, we combined the concept of considering evolutionary paths as stochastic processes on complex adaptive landscapes (<a href=\"#bib88\">Wright, 1932</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gavrilets, 1997</a>) with the analysis of extant C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> intermediate species to develop a predictive model of how the full C<sub>4</sub> phenotype evolved."

                                "text": "To parameterise the phenotypic landscape underlying photosynthetic phenotypes, data was consolidated from 43 studies encompassing 18 C<sub>3</sub>, 18 C<sub>4</sub>, and 37 C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> intermediate species from 22 genera (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). These C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> species are from 18 independent lineages likely representing 18 distinct evolutionary origins of C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> intermediacy (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sage et al., 2011a</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These studies were used to quantify 16 biochemical, anatomical, and cellular characteristics associated with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed to confirm the phenotypic intermediacy of the C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> species (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This result, the sister-group relationships of C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> species with congeneric C<sub>4</sub> clades (<a href=\"#bib51\">McKown et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Vogan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Christin et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sage et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Khoshravesh et al., 2012</a>) and the prevalence of extant C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> species in genera with the most recent origins of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Christin et al., 2011b</a>) all support the notion that C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> species represent phenotypic states through which transitions to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis could occur. The combined traits of C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> intermediate species therefore represent samples from across the space of phenotypes connecting C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Within our meta-analysis data, C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> phenotypes were available for 33 eudicot and 4 monocot species. 16 and 17 of these species have extant congeneric relatives performing NADP-ME or NAD-ME sub-type C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis respectively. No C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> relatives of PCK sub-type C<sub>4</sub> species are known (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sage et al., 2011a</a>). Our meta-analysis therefore encompassed a variety of taxonomic lineages, as well as representing close relatives of known phenotypic variants performing C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis."

In convergent evolution, these properties are not always known, as convergent lineages may be genetically distant and associated with poor phylogenetic reconstructions. In addition, the selective pressures experienced by each may be different and dynamic. We therefore consider the convergent evolution of C<sub>4</sub> fundamentally as the acquisition of the key phenotypic traits identified through our meta-analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The process of acquisition of these traits can be pictured as a path on the 16-dimensional hypercube (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), from the node labelled with all 0\u2019s (the C<sub>3</sub> phenotype, with no C<sub>4</sub> characteristics) to the node labelled with all 1\u2019s (the C<sub>4</sub> phenotype, with all C<sub>4</sub> characteristics)."

Observed intermediate points were then used to constrain the structure of these phenotypic landscapes. To do this, we developed inferential machinery based on the framework of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rabiner, 1989</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) and simulated an ensemble of Markov chains on trial transition networks. Each of these chains represents a possible evolutionary pathway from C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub>, and passes through several intermediate phenotypic states. The likelihood of observing intermediate states with characteristics compatible with the biologically observed data on C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> intermediates was recorded for the set of paths supported on each trial network. A Bayesian MCMC procedure was used to sample from the set of networks most compatible with the meta-analysis dataset, and thus most likely to represent the underlying dynamics of C<sub>4</sub> evolution. The order in which phenotypic characteristics were acquired was recorded for paths on each network compatible with the C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> species data, and posterior probability distributions (given uninformative priors) for the time-ordered acquisition of each C<sub>4</sub> trait were generated.

Our approach clearly assigned equal acquisition probabilities to traits whose timing was linked in the underlying dataset, even when 50% of the data was occluded (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

If the mean of this distribution was &lt;25% or &gt;75%, and that value fell outside one standard deviation of the mean, the missing trait was assigned a strong prediction of absence or presence. To comprehensively test the accuracy of our predictive machinery, we generated 29 occluded datasets, consisting of the original full dataset with one randomly chosen data point removed. The predicted phenotype of each missing trait was then compared with the known phenotype published in the original study. For 29 occluded traits 18 were strongly predicted to be present or absent, and the remaining 11 predictions were neutral. Of the 18 strongly predicted traits (i.e., &lt;25% or &gt;75% probability), 15 were correct, with only one false positive and two false negative predictions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The approach therefore assigns neutral predictions much more frequently than false positive or false negative predictions, suggesting that its outputs are highly conservative, and thus unlikely to produce artefacts. Predictions were generated for phenotypes that have not yet been described in C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> species (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Quantitative real-time PCR experimentally verified a subset of these, relating to abundance of C<sub>4</sub> enzymes not previously measured (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>). We also found that the model was able to successfully infer evolutionary dynamics in artificially constructed datasets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>). Taken together, these prediction and verification studies illustrate that our approach robustly identifies key features of C<sub>4</sub> evolution."

Although hierarchical clustering generated differences in the scoring of a small number of traits, the predicted evolutionary trajectories were not affected, producing highly similar results (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Second, we introduced structural changes to the phenotype space, by both adding and subtracting traits from the analysis (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Removing two independent pairs of traits from the analysis did not affect the predicted timing of the remaining 14 traits (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>). However, increased standard deviations were observed in some cases (e.g., for the probabilities of acquiring enlarged BS cells, or decreased vein spacing) likely a consequence of using fewer data. To test if the addition of data might also affect the results, we performed an analysis with two additional traits included (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). We selected two traits that have been widely observed in C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> species, the centripetal positioning of mitochondria and the centrifugal or centripetal position of chloroplasts within BS cells (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sage et al., 2012</a>).

We therefore aimed to test if multiple traits were predicted to evolve with linked timing, and therefore likely mediated by a single underlying mechanism. To achieve this, we performed a contingency analysis by considering trajectories across phenotype space beginning with a given initial acquisition step. In this analysis, the starting genome had one of the 16 traits acquired and the rest absent, and the contingency of the subsequent trajectory upon the initial step was recorded. This approach was designed to test if acquiring one C<sub>4</sub> trait increased the probability of subsequently acquiring other traits, thus detecting if the evolution of multiple traits is linked by underlying mechanisms. Inflexible linkage between multiple traits was detected in artificial positive control datasets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) but not in the C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> dataset (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

First, no single sequence of acquisitions was capable of producing intermediate phenotypes compatible with all observations (\u2018Methods\u2019). Second, several traits such as compartmentation of GDC into BS and the increased number of chloroplasts in the BS clearly displayed bimodal probability distributions for their acquisition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This bimodality is indicative of multiple distinct pathways to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis that acquire traits at earlier or later times. To investigate factors underlying this bimodality, we inferred evolutionary pathways generating the C<sub>4</sub> leaf using data from monocot and eudicot lineages, or from lineages using NAD malic enzyme (NAD\u2013ME) or NADP malic enzyme (NADP-ME) as their primary C<sub>4</sub> acid decarboxylase. PCA on the entire set of inferred transition networks for monocot and dicot subsets revealed distinct separation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting that the topology of the evolutionary landscape surrounding C<sub>4</sub> is largely different for these two anciently diverged taxa. Performing this PCA including networks that were inferred from the full data set (with both lineages) confirmed that this separation is a robust result and involves posterior variation on a comparable scale to that of the full set of possible networks (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Analysis of the posterior probabilities of the mean pathways representing either monocots or dicots revealed that this separation is the result of differences in the timing of events generating both anatomical and biochemical traits (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We propose that the ancient divergence of the monocot and eudicot clades constrained the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis to broadly different evolutionary pathways in each."

The proliferation of chloroplasts in the BS was also acquired with different timings between the two sub-types.

However, the majority of complex biological traits provide numerous challenges in utilising such an approach, including missing phenotypic data, incomplete phylogenetic information and in the case of convergent evolution, variable ancestral states. Here we report the development of a novel, predictive Bayesian approach that is able to infer likely evolutionary trajectories connecting phenotypes from sparsely sampled, highly stochastic data. With this model, we provided insights into the evolution of one of the most complex traits to have arisen in multiple lineages: C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. However, as our approach is not dependent on detailed phylogenetic inference, we propose that it could be used to model the evolution of other complex traits, such as those in the fossil record, which are also currently limited by the fragmented nature of data available (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kidwell and Holland, 2002</a>). Our approach is also not limited by the time-scale over which predicted trajectories occur. As a result, it may be useful in inferring pathways underlying stochastic processes occurring over much shorter timescales, such as disease or tumour progression, or the differentiation of cell types."

According to this hypothesis, alterations to the localisation and abundance of the primary carboxylases PEPC and RuBisCO would be expected to occur early in the evolutionary trajectories generating C<sub>4</sub>. Conversely, our data suggest that alterations to anatomy and cell biology were predicted to precede the majority of biochemical alterations, and that other enzymes of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway are recruited prior to PEPC and RuBisCO (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These enzymes, such as PPDK and C<sub>4</sub> acid decarboxylases, function in processes not related to photosynthesis within leaves of C<sub>3</sub> plants (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aubry et al., 2011</a>), so the early changes to abundance and localisation of these enzymes within C<sub>4</sub> lineages may have been driven by non-photosynthetic pressures. A recent in silico study also predicts that changes to photorespiratory metabolism and GDC in BS cells evolved prior to the C<sub>4</sub> pathway (<a href=\"#bib28\">Heckman et al., 2013</a>). Our model predicts that BS-specificity of GDC was acquired early in C<sub>4</sub> evolution for the majority of lineages. However, we also note that the predicted timing of GDC BS-specificity is bimodal in our analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), and not predicted to be acquired early in monocot lineages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

For example, we find that differences in the timing of events altering leaf vascular development and BS chloroplast division occur prior to the appearance of the alternative evolutionary pathways generating the NADP-ME and NAD-ME biochemical sub-types (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These traits are predicted to evolve prior to any alterations to the C<sub>4</sub> acid decarboxylase enzymes that traditionally define these sub-types (<a href=\"#bib20\">Furbank, 2011</a>). As an homologous mechanism has been shown to regulate the cell-specificity of gene expression in both NADP-ME and NAD-ME gene families in independent lineages (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2011</a>), it is unlikely that mechanisms underlying the recruitment of these enzymes drove the evolution of distinct sub-types. We therefore conclude that these different sub-types evolved as a consequence of alternative evolutionary histories in leaf development, rather than biochemical or photosynthetic pressures. This may explain why differences in the carboxylation efficiency or photosynthetic performance of different C<sub>4</sub> sub-types have never been detected (<a href=\"#bib20\">Furbank, 2011</a>), making the adaptive significance of different decarboxylation mechanisms difficult to explain. Instead, we propose that early evolutionary events determined the downstream phenotypes of C<sub>4</sub> sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space. The numerous differences in leaf development and cell biology between C<sub>4</sub> sub-types (<a href=\"#bib20\">Furbank, 2011</a>) may provide clues as to which developmental changes underlie subsequent differences in metabolic evolution."

Several studies on more simple traits have demonstrated that convergence upon a phenotype can be specified by diverse genotypes, and thus non-homologous molecular mechanisms in independent lineages (<a href=\"#bib87\">Wittkopp et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hill et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Steiner et al., 2009</a>). Taken together, our data also indicate that flexibility in the viable series of evolutionary events has also facilitated the convergence of this highly complex trait. First, we show that at least four distinct evolutionary trajectories underlie the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> lineages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Second, we find no evidence for inflexible linkage between the predicted timing of distinct C<sub>4</sub> traits (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This diversity in viable pathways also helps explain why C<sub>4</sub> has been accessible to such a wide variety of species and not limited to a smaller subset of the angiosperm phylogeny. A recent model for the evolution of the biochemistry associated with the C<sub>4</sub> leaf also found that C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis was accessible from any surrounding point of a fitness landscape (<a href=\"#bib28\">Heckman et al., 2013</a>). Our study of C<sub>4</sub> anatomy, biochemistry, and cell biology also suggests the C<sub>4</sub> phenotype is accessible from multiple trajectories. Encouragingly, the trajectories predicted by <a href=\"#bib28\">Heckman et al. (2013)</a> were found to pass through phenotypes of C<sub>3</sub>\u2013C<sub>4</sub> species, despite the fact that these species were not used to parameterise the evolutionary landscape. As different mechanisms generate increased abundance and cell-specificity for the majority C<sub>4</sub> enzymes in independent C<sub>4</sub> lineages (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib47\">Langdale, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Williams et al., 2012</a>), it is likely that mechanistic diversity underlies the multiple evolutionary pathways generating C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis and may be a key factor in facilitating the convergent evolution of complex traits. This may benefit efforts to recapitulate the acquisition of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis through the genetic engineering of C<sub>3</sub> species (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hibberd et al., 2008</a>), expanding the molecular toolbox available to establish C<sub>4</sub> traits in distinct phenotypic backgrounds."

To test the approach in a pleiotropic setting, where multiple traits were acquired simultaneously, we also constructed data sets where traits were acquired at only four timesteps, each corresponding to the simultaneous acquisition of four traits. We subjected these datasets to our inferential machinery with all data intact, and with 50% of data points occluded, to determine the sensitivity and robustness of our approach (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>). The approach accurately determines the ordering of events in both the bare and occluded cases and assigns very similar posterior probability distributions to the ordering of those traits acquired simultaneously."

It is largely an in silico study, inferring the evolutionary dynamics within 16 traits that distinguish C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants. The 18 lineages fall into 4 classes within which the order of appearance of the traits is convergent. Furthermore, the model predicts that there is a strong preference for the order of appearance of traits, a feature the authors have validated by measuring some previously undetermined trait values (a proxy being the abundance of transcripts by qPCR)."

It suggests that the initial phenotypic directions were unrelated to photosynthetic drivers, and only later co-opted for a common end point. This is a valuable insight, and it seems to exemplify what could be a generic mechanism to explain convergent evolution of complex traits. The work shows just how far one can get with the systematic analysis of fragmented phenotype data, with a cross-disciplinary approach, even so far as to make verifiable predictions for missing trait data."
