About a year ago, I first heard the phrase \u201cowning your mistakes\u201d on sports radio, and that term has stayed with me since then. Listening to sports radio gives one insight into the moral compass of a swath of the American public (and is a welcome relief from the litany of violence, disaster and true evil that permeates the real news from all over the globe). The sportscasters and the members of the public who phone in are forgiving of people who have made mistakes and are willing to \u201cown\u201d them. For example, the coach who called the wrong play, or the player who said something dumb when interviewed, are easily forgiven when they \u201cown their mistakes\u201d."

All of us who attempt to do science that breaks new ground are likely to make honest mistakes. Naturally we will try to make as few mistakes as possible, but it is inevitable that when we are working at the frontiers of knowledge, we will not always know which control experiments are necessary. Or some as-yet-unknown factor will turn out to play an unforeseen role in the processes we are studying. There are an infinite number of ways that honest errors can creep into our work. Or, as recently happened to a colleague of mine, something that has worked for 20 years will just stop working, for unknown reasons."

Unlike analytic solutions in math, biology has always benefitted from some experiments that require \u2018good hands\u2019, or the virtuosity needed to do an experiment with enough care and skill to generate stunning images or really clean data. We know that laboratory work includes some artistry, and that artistry is difficult to explain, teach or describe in a methods section. Each investigator consciously or unconsciously makes modifications in \u2018lab lore\u2019, often without realizing that a small tweak that does not seem to change anything could influence the experiment under different conditions."

In the latter case, these mistakes are usually noticed by someone \u2018out there\u2019 and can be simply acknowledged and fixed. Some errors are self-correcting, such as when a new student innocently applies dopamine made in distilled water rather than saline, and the preparation dies. Others are harder to spot, especially as the tradition of maintaining meticulous laboratory notebooks (a practice that helps in the detection of errors) is being eroded."

I take great comfort when two or more laboratories (either competitors or collaborators) do approximately the same experiments and produce similar, if not identical, results. To the extent to which a finding is important, it is that much more important to know that competing laboratories obtain essentially the same conclusions. For this reason, I have never been able to understand the logic of journals that refuse to publish a finding if it was \u2018scooped\u2019 by a few weeks or months."

So until we embrace the notion that some amount of independent replication deserves the same accolades as the first publication of an important finding, we are <i>de facto</i> creating the temptation to cut corners. In the spirit of owning our errors, I suggest that by unduly rewarding the group with the first report of an important finding, we have collectively created an atmosphere with disincentives for \u2018getting it right\u2019 if doing so means losing the race to be first."

In American football, the winner is the team that scores the most points, and instant replay helps referees and umpires to get it right most of the time. In science, scores result from often elusive and subjective judgments. And while sports fans argue endlessly about who should be named a Hall of Fame quarterback, their criteria are far more straightforward than those that govern the award of honors in science, and they do not distort the sports concerned. Sport needs winners and losers\u2014the same should not be true in science."
