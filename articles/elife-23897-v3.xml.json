However, how autophagy contributes to plant immunity is unknown. Here we reported that the plant autophagic machinery targets the virulence factor \u03b2C1 of <i>Cotton leaf curl Multan virus</i> (CLCuMuV) for degradation through its interaction with the key autophagy protein ATG8. A V32A mutation in \u03b2C1 abolished its interaction with NbATG8f, and virus carrying \u03b2C1<sup>V32A</sup> showed increased symptoms and viral DNA accumulation in plants. Furthermore, silencing of autophagy-related genes <i>ATG5</i> and <i>ATG7</i> reduced plant resistance to the DNA viruses CLCuMuV, <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</i>, and <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</i>, whereas activating autophagy by silencing <i>GAPC</i> genes enhanced plant resistance to viral infection. Thus, autophagy represents a novel anti-pathogenic mechanism that plays an important role in antiviral immunity in plants."

However, how autophagy contributes to plant immunity is unknown. Here we reported that the plant autophagic machinery targets the virulence factor \u03b2C1 of <i>Cotton leaf curl Multan virus</i> (CLCuMuV) for degradation through its interaction with the key autophagy protein ATG8. A V32A mutation in \u03b2C1 abolished its interaction with NbATG8f, and virus carrying \u03b2C1<sup>V32A</sup> showed increased symptoms and viral DNA accumulation in plants. Furthermore, silencing of autophagy-related genes <i>ATG5</i> and <i>ATG7</i> reduced plant resistance to the DNA viruses CLCuMuV, <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</i>, and <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</i>, whereas activating autophagy by silencing <i>GAPC</i> genes enhanced plant resistance to viral infection. Thus, autophagy represents a novel anti-pathogenic mechanism that plays an important role in antiviral immunity in plants."

Further experiments then identified a mutation in this protein that stopped it interacting with ATG8.

The two major mechanisms for plant antiviral immunity are RNA silencing and resistance (<i>R</i>) gene-mediated resistance (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mandadi and Scholthof, 2013</a>). RNA silencing is a sequence-specific mechanism used to directly defend host cells against foreign invaders such as viruses and transposable elements (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ding, 2010</a>). By contrast, the activation of <i>R</i> gene-mediated resistance triggers a rapid defense response that often includes localized programmed cell death, known as the hypersensitive response (HR). The HR can prevent local viral infection and elicit systemic acquired resistance to viral infection."

During the plant\u2019s response to incompatible pathogens, autophagy contributes to HR cell death but restricts the spread of programmed cell death beyond the initial infection site (<a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Patel and Dinesh-Kumar, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hofius et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Yoshimoto et al., 2009</a>).

Indeed, viral proteins are reported to promote autophagic degradation of plant host RNAi-related components (<a href=\"#bib10\">Derrien et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng and Wang, 2016</a>). In addition, 2b protein from <i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i> is thought to be targeted for degradation by autophagy through the calmodulin-like protein rgsCaM (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nakahara et al., 2012</a>). Recently, an oomycete effector is reported to interfere with autophagy by depleting the putative selective autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8 complexes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dagdas et al., 2016</a>). However, the role of autophagy in degrading pathogen effectors or plant defense-related proteins and the effect of viral effectors on autophagy remain uncertain in plants. All current findings are based on the data from chemical autophagy inhibitor treatments (with potential off-target effects) and/or silencing of autophagy-nonspecific autophagy-related (ATG) gene <i>Beclin 1</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Derrien et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Nakahara et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng and Wang, 2016</a>).

In addition to cotton, CLCuMuV infects many other plants, including <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. CLCuMuV encodes six proteins, namely C1, C2, C3, C4, V1 and V2, whereas CLCuMuB is approximately half the size of the CLCuMuV DNA genome and encodes a single protein, \u03b2C1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Briddon et al., 2003</a>). Like most \u03b2C1 factors encoded by geminivirus betasatellites, CLCuMuB \u03b2C1 is required by CLCuMuV for the induction of disease symptoms in plants.

To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether geminivirus infection could induce autophagy in <i>N. benthamiana</i>. First, we performed quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, finding that mRNA levels of <i>NbATG2</i>, <i>NbATG3</i>, <i>NbATG5</i>, and <i>NbATG7</i> were upregulated during the infection of plants with CLCuMuV (CA) plus CLCuMuB (\u03b2) (hereafter referred to as CLCuMuV infection or CA+\u03b2) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then used Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP)-tagged NbATG8f (CFP-NbATG8f) as an autophagosome marker (<a href=\"#bib16\">Han et al., 2015</a>) to visualize possible autophagic activity. In <i>N. benthamiana</i> plants infected with CA+\u03b2, we observed increased numbers of autophagosomes (represented by CFP-NbATG8f puncta) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that viral infection increased the number of autophagic structures in infected cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>) compared to the control. Further, we tested the effect of CLCuMuV infection on autophagy flux using Joka2/NBR1, a selective autophagy cargo receptor, as a protein marker. Joka2 has been used as a useful tool to measure autophagy flux in plants because it is degraded in the vacuole once autophagy activity increases (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Xu et al., 2017</a>). Indeed, we found that CLCuMuV infection (CA+\u03b2) reduced the protein level of NbJoka2, although it did not change mRNA level of NbJoka2 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that viral infection enhances autophagic flux. These data demonstrate that CLCuMuV infection induces autophagy."

For this purpose, we silenced autophagy-related genes in <i>N. benthamiana</i> using <i>Tobacco rattle virus</i> (TRV)-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2002</a>). Because there is functional redundancy of <i>ATG8</i> genes due to the presence of multiple homologs in plants, we silenced <i>NbATG5</i> and <i>NbATG7</i> in <i>N. benthamiana</i>. Compared to non-silenced control plants, the mRNA levels of <i>NbATG5</i> and <i>NbATG7</i> were significantly reduced by gene-specific VIGS (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), whereas we observed no obvious differences in TRV RNA levels between <i>ATG5-</i>silenced plants, <i>ATG7-</i>silenced plants, and control plants (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In addition, autophagy was blocked in <i>ATG5-</i> and <i>ATG7-</i>silenced plants (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). It is worth noting that CLCuMuV infection had no effect on TRV-mediated VIGS (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Furthermore, <i>ATG5-</i> and <i>ATG7-</i>silenced plants did not show any abnormal developmental phenotypes. We then infected <i>ATG5-</i> and <i>ATG7-</i>silenced plants with CA+\u03b2. We observed that the leaf curl symptoms caused by viral infection were much more severe and appeared 3 days earlier (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), and CLCuMuV DNA levels were significantly higher in <i>ATG5-</i> and <i>ATG7-</i> silenced plants compared to control plants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). By contrast, silencing of <i>GFP</i> in a <i>N. benthamiana GFP</i> transgenic line 16C had no effect on CA+\u03b2 infection (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Furthermore, silencing of <i>Joka2</i>, encoding a selective autophagy cargo receptor for polyubiquitinated cargoes, enhances susceptibility to <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> although it is not reported whether disrupting autophagy has an effect on plant response to this pathogen (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dagdas et al., 2016</a>). However, we found that <i>Joka2</i> silencing had no effect on CLCuMuV infection (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), implying that Joka2-mediated selective autophagy is not involved in antiviral defense against CLCuMuV in plants. CLCuMuB \u03b2C1 may not interfere with Joka2-mediated selective autophagy by depleting Joka2 out of ATG8 complexes because it has a non-classic ATG8-interacting motif (see below). In addition, silencing of autophagy-related genes caused cell death induced by <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> (TMV) to spread in inoculated leaves of <i>N. benthamiana</i> plants containing the TMV resistance gene <i>N</i> but had no effect on plant systemic resistance against TMV (<a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2005</a>).

However, little is known about whether and/or how autophagy affects viral infection in plants. Plant viruses encode antiviral RNA silencing suppressors known as VSRs. Based on the data from autophagy inhibitor 3-MA treatment, the VSR protein P0 from Polerovirus is thought to trigger the autophagic degradation of AGO1, a component of the cellular RNAi-based antiviral defense machinery (<a href=\"#bib10\">Derrien et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, the VSR protein VPg from <i>Turnip mosaic virus</i> is also reported to mediate the degradation of the cellular RNAi-based antiviral defense component SGS3, partially via autophagy (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng and Wang, 2016</a>). Based on the data from an autophagy inhibitor treatment and silencing of an autophagy-nonspecific ATG gene <i>Beclin 1</i>, 2b protein from <i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i> is thought to be targeted for degradation by autophagy through the calmodulin-like protein rgsCaM (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nakahara et al., 2012</a>). In addition, the in vitro application of an autophagy inhibitor wortmannin partially inhibited proteolysis of TYLCV proteins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gorovits et al., 2016</a>). In our study, by silencing of two ATG genes (<i>ATG5</i> and <i>ATG7</i>), we clearly show that CLCuMuB \u03b2C1 is degraded by autophagy. Further, autophagy genes are transcriptionally up-regulated by infection by some geminiviruses in plants (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ascencio-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Miozzi et al., 2014</a>).

Furthermore, a point mutation at position 32 from valine to alanine in this motif eliminated the \u03b2C1-NbATG8 interaction.

Interestingly, CLCuMuB \u03b2C1 is an ATG8-binding protein, as well as a strong silencing suppressor. This finding suggests that a delicate balance between viral pathogenesis and different host antiviral immunity mechanisms, such as autophagy and RNA silencing, has developed during plant\u2013virus co-evolution. Plants may have evolved to suppress viral infection by targeting viral protein(s) for autophagic degradation. Indeed, we showed that disrupting autophagy enhanced plant susceptibility to three different viruses, whereas increasing autophagy enhanced plant resistance against these viruses. On the other hand, possessing very strong virulence may not be the best strategy for the long-term survival of viruses in the battle between plants and viruses. In this scenario, plant viruses may have evolved the ability to use the host\u2019s cellular autophagy pathway to reduce their virulence through partial autophagic degradation of some viral virulence factors such as \u03b2C1. Thus, the virus would not completely destroy the plant cell or totally evade other host defense mechanisms such as RNA silencing or DNA methylation. Consistent with this idea, plant viruses can establish latent, mild, or severe infection in plants, but they rarely kill their hosts."

Recent evidence also suggests that autophagy is targeted by a Phytophthora effector for virulence. However, how autophagy contributes to disease resistance remains unknown. In this study the authors show that geminivirus CLCuMuV infection activates autophagy and that autophagy targets the virulence protein \u03b2C1 for degradation in the vacuoles through an interaction between ATG8 and a specific motif in \u03b2C1. A mutation in this motif not only abolishes protein-protein interaction and \u03b2C1 degradation, but also enhances disease symptoms and viral DNA accumulation. Thus the study elegantly illustrate a mechanism by which autophagy directly destruct the virulence protein to confer resistance. Although a potential involvement of autophagy in viral protein degradation has been implicated by previous pharmacological studies, the current study represents the first demonstration of such a process and elucidates how this occurs. Overall the data are convincing and manuscript well-written. The reviewers raised several issues that require editorial changes:"
