Here we exposed populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to repeated seasonal changes in resources across 58 generations and used experimental and mathematical approaches to investigate how viability selection on body size in the non-breeding season could affect demography. We show that opposing seasonal episodes of natural selection on body size interacted with both direct and delayed density dependence to cause populations to undergo predictable multigenerational density cycles. Our results provide evidence that seasonality can set the conditions for life-history trade-offs and density dependence, which can, in turn, interact to cause multigenerational population cycles."

For example, traits that help animals to produce large numbers of offspring during the breeding season may reduce the ability of the animal to survive the non-breeding season. Body size is one such trait. Large individuals tend to produce more offspring, but their larger body size means that they find it harder to survive when food is scarce. As a consequence, large individuals should have an advantage and be more common when the population size is low and there are enough resources for all individuals. However, small individuals should be more abundant when population size is high. This trade-off caused by seasonality could set the population in motion towards predictable, multigenerational cycles."

Over 58 generations, the number of flies in each population cycled between peaks of high and low numbers."

When the population was large, meaning that the flies had to compete for a limited amount of food, there was strong selection for small flies because they are better able to survive on limited resources. However, small flies also produce fewer offspring on average, resulting in a decrease in population size. When the flies all had sufficient food during the non-breeding season, these regular cycles completely disappeared."

Specifically, if smaller offspring have higher survival when density is high, then the population will be composed of smaller than average individuals with lower average fecundity in the following breeding season. This lower mean fecundity will reduce population growth rates even though larger individuals will be favoured through fecundity selection. As population size declines, the strength of density-dependent viability selection on body size will also decline, which could cause net selection to reverse and favour larger individuals due to the fecundity benefit of being larger. As large individuals increase in frequency, population size should also increase via an improvement of reproductive output, returning populations to high densities. Although changes in the intensity and direction of natural selection caused by environmental variation are widespread (<a href=\"#bib57\">Schluter et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bell, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Thompson, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bergland et al., 2014</a>), we have little information about whether opposing episodes of natural selection could arise from seasonality and indirectly affect population dynamics through the feedback loop between ecological (density dependence) and evolutionary (selection and evolution) processes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Chitty, 1960</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Krebs, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hairston et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pelletier et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ozgul et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Schoener, 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "Here, we investigated how a seasonal fitness trade-off related to body-size could affect changes in population size and body size over time using replicate populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> exposed to repeated changes in food resources. In addition to standard breeding conditions for <i>Drosophila</i>, we also created a \u2018non-breeding season\u2019 by manipulating the food medium to prevent females from laying eggs during this period. Thus, in this system, breeding and survival were restricted to two sequential and distinct seasons (hereafter 'breeding' and 'non-breeding'). The number of days and amount of food in each season was determined so that both fecundity and non-breeding survival were density-dependent (<a href=\"#bib9\">Betini et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2015</a>), which is an important feature of many populations. In <i>Drosophila</i>, as in many other species, the positive correlation between body size and fecundity is well known (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mueller and Joshi, 2000</a>; Appendix 1) and we previously demonstrated that small individuals have higher survival during the non-breeding season when abundance is high (<a href=\"#bib9\">Betini et al. 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2014</a>). In addition, populations of <i>D. melanogaster</i> do not show evidence of multigenerational cycles (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mueller and Joshi, 2000</a>), even when kept under the same conditions as our breeding season (i.e. \u2018aseasonal populations\u2019; Appendix 2). We, therefore, hypothesized that density dependence and opposing episodes of fecundity and viability selection on body resulting from seasonality could cause predictable and repeatable fluctuations in both population and body size. Specifically, we predicted that seasonal fitness trade-offs would cause population size and body size to undergo multigenerational cycles between periods of high abundance, when small individuals predominate, and periods of low abundance, when large individuals are more frequent. Furthermore, we predicted that populations not exposed to viability selection in the non-breeding season would lack periodic fluctuations in population size\u00a0and body size."

In the second experiment, we tested the role of viability selection during the non-breeding season by tracking 13 additional populations over 31 generations using a similar protocol to the \u2018long-term control\u2019, but in which we experimentally prevented viability selection in the \u2018non-breeding\u2019 season by providing high levels of food during this season (the \u2018stop-selection\u2019 treatment; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This protocol also maintained direct density effects on fecundity and survival, similar to the ones observed in the \u2018long-term control\u2019.

Such delayed density-dependent effects can also cause populations to cycle (<a href=\"#bib68\">Stenseth et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yan et al., 2013</a>), or lead to more complex dynamics, such as chaos (May 1973). One potential mechanism for delayed density dependence are carry-over effects, which we have previously identified in this seasonal system (<a href=\"#bib9\">Betini et al., 2013a</a>). Thus, we first investigated if lag effects were present in all three experiments, and then used the mathematical model to understand whether they played a role in the dynamics of their populations."

The model without viability selection on body size and delayed density dependence (i.e. including only effects of current abundance on fecundity and survival), resulted in the elimination of multigenerational cycles (after red line in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>), as observed in our 'stop selection' populations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). The exclusion of only viability selection eliminated the fitness trade-off in body size and allowed larger flies to survive to breed. This led to unstable population dynamics (i.e. the population crashed after 10 generations; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>) because larger flies have greater fecundity and there was a negative interaction between body size and abundance. The exclusion of delayed density dependence alone eliminated the cycles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>), suggesting that viability selection and delayed density dependence are necessary for these persistent multigenerational cycles to occur. The model with low heritability (<i>h<sup>2</sup></i>\u00a0=\u00a010<sup>\u22125</sup>) also generated multigenerational population cycles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>)."

In our experimental system, seasonal variation in resources resulted in a fitness trade-off and multigenerational population cycles. These cycles were observed in the absence of predation, long-term fluctuations in resources, or any explicit negative-frequency dependence, all of which are known to cause regular fluctuations in population size (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lindstr\u00f6m et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yan et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the emergence of population cycles caused by three common characteristics of natural populations (seasonality, a life-history trade-off and density-dependence), suggests that these ecological and evolutionary processes could contribute to fluctuations in population size over a wider range of taxa and environments than has previously been considered. Our experimental elimination of viability selection and delayed density-dependence and our mathematical model confirmed the importance of both of these evolutionary and ecological processes in the persistence of multigenerational population cycles resulting from seasonal environments."

Our results suggest that the\u00a0evolutionary response to selection might not be required to observe feedback between ecological and evolutionary processes, as long as selection is strong. In flies, as in many other species, body size is highly heritable (<a href=\"#bib52\">Prout and Barker, 1989</a>), and it is reasonable to suppose that, in our populations, offspring from smaller flies tend to be smaller. However, even when genetic variation is low, strong selection can still affect trait distributions within generations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Grafen, 1988</a>), potentially affecting population size. In our experimental system, selection for body size during the non-breeding season was strong enough to drive observed cycles, potentially in the absence of any genetic change across generations. Simulations with our mathematical model with essentially zero heritability (<i>h<sup>2</sup></i>\u00a0=\u00a010<sup>\u22125</sup> as opposed to 0.3) also generated multigenerational population cycles because viability selection changed the distribution of body size, which subsequently affected fecundity. Thus, changes in the\u00a0trait distribution within a generation caused by seasonal fitness trade-offs could generate feedback loops between ecological and evolutionary process in traits across generations."

These effects were strong in both the \u2018long-term control\u2019 and \u2018short-term control\u2019, but not in the \u2018stop-selection\u2019 treatment. One mechanism that can generate delayed effects is a density-mediated carry-over effect. We have shown how competition during the non-breeding season can negatively impact the physiological conditions of the\u00a0survivors, reducing their breeding output in the following breeding season (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ratikainen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Betini et al., 2013a</a>). This carry-over effect could also negatively impact survival if individuals during the non-breeding season were in lower body condition because of high abundance at the beginning of the season. Delayed density dependence can also arise from maternal effects, whereby offspring attributes are affected by parental abundance, which have previously been shown to generate population cycles (<a href=\"#bib51\">Plaistow and Benton, 2009</a>). Both carry-over effects and maternal effects have the potential to interact with viability and fecundity selection because they can affect individual fecundity and survival via changes in body size and condition."

It is clear from the model that the addition of viability selection allowed for sustained multigenerational cycles, as was observed in our empirical results. These results are in general agreement with previous studies. For example, in a predator-prey system, evolutionary changes in the prey population extended density cycles compared to the typical quarter-period phase lags between prey and predator densities (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yoshida et al., 2003</a>).\u00a0This\u00a0evolutionary\u00a0effect is now\u00a0believed to be widespread in lab systems (<a href=\"#bib3\">Becks et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hiltunen et al., 2014</a>). Thus, it is possible that evolutionary processes affecting trait distributions within and between generations can buffer strong negative feedback caused by ecological processes that are typical in many natural systems (e.g. overcompensation caused by density dependence), representing a different form of evolutionary rescue (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bell, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Carlson et al., 2014</a>)."

Although body size caused fitness trade-offs between seasons in our experimental system, many other traits might also exhibit seasonal trade-offs. For example, sexually selected traits enhance mating success, but might also reduce survival during the non-breeding season (<a href=\"#bib23\">Emlen, 2001</a>). Alternatively, increased development rates can accelerate age of first reproduction, but are often associated with reduced survival during the adult stage (<a href=\"#bib67\">Stearns, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kingsolver and Huey, 2008</a>)."

We showed how opposing episodes of selection driven by a life-history trade-off arise in seasonal environments, which could interact with delayed effects to influence population size. Recently, it has been proposed that results from lab studies on consumer-resource dynamics were likely confounded by fast evolutionary changes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hiltunen et al., 2014</a>). The same could be true for lab and field studies on population cycles, if changes in trait distributions are linked to population size. To understand whether this is a common phenomenon in natural populations, one needs to tease apart the evolutionary from the ecological consequences of variation in density. As in our lab system, this is a constraint that needs to be overcome with either improved controlled experiments or mathematical approaches. Nevertheless, given that variation in density is common in many natural systems, measurements of selection and population density in both seasons will provide a better understanding of the dynamics of natural populations and how environmental change might alter such dynamics."

During the breeding season, we placed adults in vials (28 \u00d7 95 mm) with a dead yeast-sugar medium to lay for 24 hr (day 0), after which adults were discarded and larvae were allowed to mature to adults (16 days). Individuals were then transferred (day 17) to a non-breeding environment for 4 days. The non-breeding season consisted of an empty vial of the same size as the breeding vials, but food was provided by a pipette tip filled with 0.200 ml of 5% water\u2013sugar solution per day from the top of the vial. This solution was sufficient for many flies to survive (~95% survival at low population size) but did not allow females to lay eggs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bownes and Blair, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Betini et al., 2013a</a>). In both seasonal treatments, a consistent amount of food was provided regardless of population size, which caused reproduction and survival to be density-dependent (<a href=\"#bib9\">Betini et al., 2013a</a>). Each of 45 replicate populations was repeatedly transferred between breeding and non-breeding environments for 58 generations and together they are referred to as \u2018long-term controls\u2019.

Cycles can be inferred by investigating the shape of the estimated ACF: population cycles are characterized by stationary periodic dynamics, which result in an oscillatory decay to zero of the ACF estimates. We calculated the ACF for each treatment using the mean population size across all replicates at the start of the breeding and non-breeding season in each generation. For all-time series, we excluded the first three generations to avoid any transient effects caused by the initial population size.

In previous work, we have shown that fecundity in this system is influenced by an interaction between current abundance at the beginning of the breeding season and at the beginning of the previous non-breeding season (<a href=\"#bib9\">Betini et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2013b</a>). Thus, in this study, we also investigated if this interaction significantly explained variation in fecundity in all three experiments. Fecundity was calculated as the number of individuals at the end of the breeding season (i.e. number of offspring) divided by the number of individuals at the beginning of the same breeding season (number of parents). Because we did not know how environmental effects (e.g. physiological condition) could influence survival in our system, we incorporated the breeding and non-breeding abundance going back two generations as explanatory variables in the model to explain survival. Lag effects have been documented in natural populations subjected to strong seasonality (<a href=\"#bib41\">Merritt et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Stenseth et al., 2003</a>).

For each season, the mean breeding value for body size and the mean phenotypic value for body size were modelled, where the phenotypic value of an individual was its breeding value plus a random environmental effect. We assumed that breeding and phenotypic values were normally distributed and that the variance in breeding values and the variance in environmental effects remained constant across generations. The assumption of a constant variance in breeding values assumed that mutational variance and changes in genetic architecture (including linkage and epistatic interactions) could restore variance that was initially depleted by selection. Slatkin\u2019s model provides for changes in the variance of breeding values due to selection and considers the effect of genetic architecture, such as linkage (<a href=\"#bib65\">Slatkin, 1979</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">1980</a>). In our experiment, we do not have information on the genetic architecture for body size, nor mutational variance.

Current density could also negatively influence fecundity via density-dependent effects. There was a stronger negative effect of density on fecundity for large versus small individuals, although large individuals have higher intrinsic fecundity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> in the main text). During the 'stop selection' phase of the simulations, we decreased carry-over effects (parameters <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><msub><mtext>\u03c6</mtext><mn>5</mn></msub></mrow></math>and <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><msub><mtext>\u03c6</mtext><mn>6</mn></msub></mrow></math>) by 25% given that flies had unlimited amount of food in the 'stop selection' treatments and were likely to be in better physiological condition than those in the 'short-term control' treatments.

We included the effects of past density beyond the ones described above, going back two generations. During the 'stop selection' phase of the simulations, survival was not a function of body size nor past density, but was instead only affected by current density, following the logistic equation Su for survivorship and the experimental design. To accomplish this and to ensure proper scaling of survival, we assigned all individuals the same phenotype in the survivorship function.

To simulate seasonality in populations with non-overlapping generations, we changed food composition to create two distinct \u2018seasons\u2019. During the \u2018breeding season\u2019, flies were allowed to lay eggs for 24 hr (day 0) in a dead yeast\u2013sugar medium (1000 ml H2O, 100 g sucrose, 50 g Fleischmann\u2019s yeast, 16 g agar, 8 g C4H4KNaO6, 1 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g NaCl, 0.5 g MgCl2, 0.5 g CaCl2, 0.5 g Fe2(SO4)3), after which adults were discarded and larvae were allowed to mature to adults. During the breeding season, emerging offspring were moved from old to new vials containing fresh food on days 10, 12 and 14 to avoid high offspring mortality (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dey and Joshi, 2006</a>). During this period, densities of offspring were not manipulated, that is, their densities were a function of the number of flies that emerged during the breeding season. Flies were marked with a fluorescent dust (as part of the protocol of another experiment) and let rest overnight in larger bottles (177.4 ml) with 20 ml of food so that they could easily remove the excess of dust. On day 17, flies were lightly anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub>, counted and placed into the non-breeding vials. The non-breeding season consisted of an empty vial of the same size as the breeding vials (28 \u00d7 95 mm) and a pipette tip filled with 0.200 ml of 5% water\u2013sugar solution per day. This medium prevented females from producing eggs (<a href=\"#bib70\">Terashima et al., 2005</a>) but also resulted in density-dependent mortality, as would be expected from wild populations (<a href=\"#bib9\">Betini et al., 2013a</a>). Oviposition resumed within\u00a0&lt;12 hr when flies were placed back on a protein-rich food (<a href=\"#bib70\">Terashima et al., 2005</a>). After 4 days in the non-breeding season, surviving flies were counted and the cycle was repeated. Note that since adults were removed after laying at the start of the breeding season, there were non-overlapping generations and each generation experienced only a single breeding and non-breeding season. We also randomly removed 5% of each population each time they were moved between seasons to mimic migratory mortality and dispersal. This procedure was repeated for 58 generations in each of 45 replicate populations. During all experiments, flies were kept at 25\u00b0C, 12 hr light/dark cycles and humidity was between 30% to 50%."

Using a series of experimental evolution studies with <i>Drosophila</i> populations, Betini and colleagues show how density dependency and viability selection leads to multi-generational cycles of the populations. They make use of the fact that body size affects fecundity (positively) and survival (negatively) and that these two traits trade off between breeding and non-breeding seasons (limited food supply). Specifically, they compare the evolutionary (body size) and ecological changes (density) within populations when manipulating seasonality (absence, presence with very low and low food supply). They found that seasonality leads to multi-generational cycles of 7-9 generations and that these cycles increase with lower food supply in the non-breeding season. An additional mathematical model shows that the multi-generational cycles depend on the trade-off and differential selection between seasons and the density-dependency of growth. Overall, this is an important study showing in an elegant way the underlying mechanism producing multi-generational cycles in populations without interspecific species interactions. It adds to the growing evidence that ecological and (rapid) evolutionary dynamics interact at one timescale. I have however several concerns that need to be addressed:"

Given the number of experiments it might be helpful to replace one of the many results graphs with a simple illustration showing the various experiments. b) Because the journal format is to put methods after the results (I am not a fan of this) the authors need to adjust their sections to reflect this or else the manuscript is unintelligible if read the way the journal intends.

They make use of the fact that body size affects fecundity (positively) and survival (negatively) and that these two traits trade off between breeding and non-breeding seasons (limited food supply). Specifically, they compare the evolutionary (body size) and ecological changes (density) within populations when manipulating seasonality (absence, presence with very low and low food supply). They found that seasonality leads to multi-generational cycles of 7-9 generations and that these cycles increase with lower food supply in the non-breeding season. An additional mathematical model shows that the multi-generational cycles depend on the trade-off and differential selection between seasons and the density-dependency of growth. Overall, this is an important study showing in an elegant way the underlying mechanism producing multi-generational cycles in populations without interspecific species interactions. It adds to the growing evidence that ecological and (rapid) evolutionary dynamics interact at one timescale. I have however several concerns that need to be addressed:</i>"

This characterization of cyclic dynamic is lacking in the ACF estimates for the stop-selection treatment (inset plot in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> in the main text). In addition, there is no consensus in the literature about the relevance of statistical tests for periodicity. Different methods or different choices within methods could give different results. For example, in our manuscript, we have eliminated the first 3 generations to avoid transient dynamics. However, we could have eliminated the first 5 or 6 generations, which would result in statistical evidence for a 16 generation cycle in our long-term treatment, but still no evidence of cycle in the stop-selection treatment (see <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response images 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig11\">2</a>)."

The reviewer\u2019s feeling is that our paper does not rise to the level of an <i>eLife</i> paper because we have not shown genetic changes, which does not support the eco-evolutionary aspect of the study. We respectfully disagree with this viewpoint. We have shown that cycles can occur by internal processes through a combination of opposing episodes of natural selection between seasons (an evolutionary process) and delayed density dependence (an ecological process). Furthermore, our model shows that accompanying genetic changes are not necessary for these cycles to occur. From an ecological perspective, population cycles are typically thought to be driven by external processes, such as climate or predators, which, from an ecological perspective make our results very significant. Not only that, but we show that these cycles are driven by 3 very common elements found in almost all natural systems: seasonality, density-dependence, and natural selection, which makes our laboratory-based results applicable to wild species. Understandably, the reviewer admits that she/he is not well versed on the ecological significance of these results. However, we do not think that the paper should be rejected based on the grounds that we have not shown concurrent genetic changes because we have provided evidence that genetic changes are not necessary for cycles to occur. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of our main finding, for which we take responsibility."

As suggested, we have now used a single linear mixed effect model with body size as response variable and the interaction between density and whether body size was measured before or after the non-breeding season as fixed effect (Subsection \u201cLong-term control\u201d). Generation and population were entered as random effects.
