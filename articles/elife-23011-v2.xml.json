However, whether spasms involve activation of premotor spinal excitatory neuronal circuits is unknown. Here we use mouse genetics, electrophysiology, imaging and optogenetics to directly target major classes of spinal interneurons as well as motor neurons during spasms in a mouse model of chronic SCI. We find that assemblies of excitatory spinal interneurons are recruited by sensory input into functional circuits to generate persistent neural activity, which interacts with both the graded expression of plateau potentials in motor neurons to generate spasms, and inhibitory interneurons to curtail them. Our study reveals hitherto unrecognized neuronal mechanisms for the generation of persistent neural activity under pathophysiological conditions, opening up new targets for treatment of muscle spasms after SCI."

However, whether spasms involve activation of premotor spinal excitatory neuronal circuits is unknown. Here we use mouse genetics, electrophysiology, imaging and optogenetics to directly target major classes of spinal interneurons as well as motor neurons during spasms in a mouse model of chronic SCI. We find that assemblies of excitatory spinal interneurons are recruited by sensory input into functional circuits to generate persistent neural activity, which interacts with both the graded expression of plateau potentials in motor neurons to generate spasms, and inhibitory interneurons to curtail them. Our study reveals hitherto unrecognized neuronal mechanisms for the generation of persistent neural activity under pathophysiological conditions, opening up new targets for treatment of muscle spasms after SCI."

In the immediate phase following SCI the excitability of the spinal networks caudal to the injury is completely depressed (<a href=\"#bib36\">Klussmann and Martin-Villalba, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rossignol et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schwab et al., 2006</a>).

At the motor neuron level the development of spasms has been linked to the increased expression of plateau potentials \u2013 carried by voltage-gated persistent Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> currents \u2013 allowing motor neurons to sustain tonic firing (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bennett et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Eken et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kiehn and Eken, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Li and Bennett, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Li et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Murray et al., 2010</a>). However, all behaviorally relevant motor activities require excitatory drive to orchestrate the generation, maintenance and termination of motor responses (<a href=\"#bib29\">H\u00e4gglund et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kiehn, 2016</a>), leading to the possibility that muscle spasms may be the result of aberrant spinal excitatory drive to motor neurons. Indeed long-lasting excitatory postsynaptic potentials may be detected in motor neurons during sustained motor responses in chronic spinalized animals (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akay et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brumovsky, 2013</a>). Nevertheless, whether activity in interneurons is involved in initiating, maintaining, and terminating spasms is unknown."

The approach builds on a chronic spinal cord model developed in the rat (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bennett et al., 1999</a>) that targets a transection to the sacral segment of the spinal cord thereby producing spasms in the\u00a0tail muscles without affecting limb muscles or bowel and bladder functions. We find an increased but graded expression of plateau potentials in motor neurons, which alone does not account for spontaneous and sensory-evoked spasms. However, optical imaging in chronically spinal cord transected mice unmasked persistent neural activity in spinal interneurons with distinct spatiotemporal relationship during muscle spasms. Optogenetic activation and inactivation of spinal excitatory interneurons causally linked their activity to the triggering and maintenance of the spasms. In contrast, optogenetic stimulation of spinal inhibitory interneurons revealed a functional inhibition that played a role in sculpturing and curtailing muscle spasms."

Accordingly, our study shifts the widely held view that muscle spasms after SCI are the result of increased motor neuron excitability and reduced spinal inhibition acting as a\u00a0source of excitation. It therefore provides new directions for treatment of spasms after SCI."

The relationship between the stimulus strength and the amplitude of the H-reflex is plotted in the two panels below (mean \u00b1 S.D). The threshold for the H-reflex (T) was estimated as the lowest stimulus strength necessary to elicit the monosynaptic\u00a0response. All other stimulus strengths are expressed as multiples of this strength. In both acutely (N\u00a0=\u00a07) and chronically spinal cord transected mice (N\u00a0=\u00a010) the H-reflex (green trace) had a lower threshold than the M-wave (blue trace) caused by the direct antidromic activation of muscles. As the stimulus strength increased the H-reflex was smaller in both cases similar to what has been reported in H-reflex studies. Notably, in chronically spinal cord transected mice the rise of the H-reflex was steeper (slope of straight line to fit the rising part, chronically transected\u00a0=\u00a066.25 versus acutely transected\u00a0=\u00a047.93, Spearman r test, p&lt;0.0001) suggesting that motor neurons were hyper-excitable. Moreover, in chronically spinal cord transected mice the polysynaptic responses (red traces) were shifted to much lower stimulus thresholds in chronically spinal cord transected than in acutely spinal cord transected mice (paired T-test, p&lt;0.05), indicating hyper-excitability in interneuron circuits.

However, the number of motor neuron expressing full plateau properties that may support sustained firing was only about 10% (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Most motor neurons expressed partial plateau properties, which may promote but not sustain prolonged firing. Therefore, while motor neuron plateau potentials may contribute they alone seemed unlikely to account for the orchestrated and sustained motor activity underlying muscle spasms after chronic spinal cord transection. Accordingly, we focused our attention on premotor circuits."

When inhibitory glycinergic and Gabaergic transmission was blocked, the silent period preceding the spasm in pre-drug conditions disappeared (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), showing that the silent period in motor neurons was the result of activity in premotor inhibitory interneurons. In contrast the spasm was completely abolished when mephenesin, a blocker of polysynaptic mostly glutamatergic transmission (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cazalets et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kiehn and Butt, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lev-Tov and Pinco, 1992</a>) was applied (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Altogether, these experiments show that the\u00a0spasms were triggered by polysynaptic glutamatergic pathways, and not from direct afferent inputs to motor neurons."

EINs and iINs in chronically spinal cord transected mice exhibited spatially and temporally segregated activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In order to reveal the temporal relationship between the activity of eINs, iINs and motor neurons in the same segment, the response of the INs was normalized to the ventral root response which was divided in four periods: stimulation period (Stim; from \u22121 to 0), pre-spasm silence (Sil; from 0 to 1), spasm (spasm; from 1 to 2), and post-spasm silence (post-sp; from 2 to 3). In spinal cords of acutely spinal cord transected mice, low-threshold stimulation of the dorsal root generated a sequential activation of eINs with a mean peak of activity during the stimulation period (\u22120.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24, mean \u00b1 SD) followed by iINs immediately after the end of the stimulation (0.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13). A similar sequential activation with a first peak of excitatory activity during the stimulation (\u22120.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07) followed by inhibitory activity occurring in the silent pre-spasm period (0.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19) was present in spinal cords from chronically spinal cord transected mice. However, in chronically spinal cord transected mice, a second delayed peak of excitatory activity appeared at the beginning of the spasm (1.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2) and a second peak of inhibitory activity appeared just before the spasm ended (1.855\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

To provide such insight we expressed the light-activated Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) or Halorhodopsin (<i>eNpHR3)</i> in eINs and iINs to allow for their activation or inactivation (<a href=\"#bib29\">H\u00e4gglund et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2013</a>). We first activated Vglut2<sup>+</sup> cells in vivo with an optical fiber implanted at the level of the first coccygeal segment of the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib12\">Caggiano et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In acutely transected mice (0\u20137 days) light stimulation generated movements of the tail for the duration of stimulation only (black trace in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>; N\u00a0=\u00a05).

Similar prolonged firing was evoked in the isolated sacral cord from chronically spinal cord transected mice when any one of the spinal segments was optogenetically stimulated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The sustained activity lasted even longer when inhibitory transmission was blocked. In contrast it was almost abolished when glutamatergic neuro-transmission was silenced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>), leaving only a small direct activation of MNs, likely due to early expression of Vglut2 in some MNs (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nishimaru et al., 2005</a>)."

To evaluate this possibility we recorded the dorsal root potentials both in acutely and chronically spinalized mice. These recordings showed that light stimulation indeed led to antidromic activation of afferents, but that this activation was short-lasting (20\u201350 ms) and only present in the beginning of the stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\"><a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a></a>).

By using a mouse model of chronic spinal cord transection that allows recordings from motor neurons as well as selective visualization and manipulation of identified groups of interneurons, we show the direct involvement of excitatory interneuron populations in generating the spasms. First, motor neurons receive a massive barrage of excitatory inputs during spasms. Second, the temporal dynamics of the excitatory spinal interneuron activity correspond to the spasm generation. Thirdly, light stimulation In <i>Vglut2<sup>Cre</sup>; ChR2</i> mice initiated spasms. Although this stimulation may also activate terminals that express Vglut2 this activation was short-lasting, suggesting a substantial contribution from eINs activation to spasm generation. Finally, the absence or the severe reduction of spasms when eINs were optogenetically inhibited suggested a necessary role of eINs that could not be substituted by direct monosynaptic activation of motor neurons mediated by Vglut1 expression primary afferents (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brumovsky, 2013</a>). All together these experiments suggest a pivotal role of eINs in triggering and sustaining the persistent neural activity. Importantly, the sustained activity was not generated by excitatory persistent dorsal root reflexes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bos et al., 2011</a>). Such prolonged effects were not elicited neither by electrical nor optogenetic stimulation in the present study."

The plateau properties are generated by persistent Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> currents (<a href=\"#bib40\">Li and Bennett, 2003</a>), whose manifestations are regulated by constitutively opened 5-HT receptors (<a href=\"#bib46\">Murray et al., 2010</a>) or 5-HT released from cells in the spinal cord containing the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wienecke et al., 2014</a>). Our study also shows that motor plateau properties are more prevalent after chronic spinal cord transection, and the degree of expression of these properties matches the firing pattern of individual motor neurons during spasms. However, similar to what has been reported in the rat (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bennett et al., 2001b</a>) we find that only about 10% of the motor neurons express full plateau potentials needed to support sustained firing (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hounsgaard et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kiehn et al., 1996</a>) after chronic spinal cord transection. The majority of motor neurons expressed partial plateau properties, characterized by membrane properties that will promote but not by themselves sustain prolonged firing in the absence of synaptic inputs. Together, these findings underscore the contribution of these biophysical properties to prolonged firing in motor neurons after SCI but make it unlikely that motor neuron plateau properties are the main carrier of spasms."

In contrast, our findings explicitly demonstrate that the activity of iINs is increased after chronic spinal cord transection with no sign of a decreased efficacy of inhibitory inputs onto motor neurons. The presence of a silent period preceding electrically-evoked spasm suggested that inhibition was still activated by sensory stimulation and it was able to suppress motor neuron responses. Furthermore, the optogenetic activation of iINs in the sacral spinal cord was able to suppress spasms and all motor responses after chronic spinal cord transection. In contrast, iINs were not able to generate and/or maintain the persistent neural activity driving MNs during muscle spasms as revealed by optogenetic stimulation both in vivo and in vitro, showing that inhibition is not reverted to depolarizing IPSPs that triggers motor output. So the functional role of inhibition is to sculpture and terminate the prolonged spasms. Our study therefore shifts the focus away from a decreased inhibition as a cause of spasm generation and reassigns to iINs a key functional role in shaping the temporal expression of muscle spasms and its termination."

Our study represents the first investigation where the functional impact of these changes has been directly tested, revealing insights about the operational logic of spinal circuits after injury. The appearance of persistent activity in spinal circuits may emerge from changes in network properties and/or biophysical properties of the spinal INs after transection. Indeed, the number of cells responding to low-threshold dorsal root stimulation appeared to be much higher after chronic spinal cord transection. Possible explanations for this are that proprioceptive afferents \u2013 whose activity is important for motor recovery after spinal cord transection (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akay et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Takeoka et al., 2014</a>) \u2013 provide stronger activation of excitatory neurons due to intraspinal sprouting of proprioceptive afferents (<a href=\"#bib37\">Krenz and Weaver, 1998</a>) or due to reduced presynaptic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kathe et al., 2016</a>). The increased activity of excitatory interneurons may also engage mechanisms of feed-forward and/or recurrent excitation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbinanti et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wang, 2001</a>). Feed-forward circuits among excitatory neurons may be recruited by the chronic spinal cord transection as a result of intraspinal sprouting. Moreover, since the\u00a0populations of eINs were activated more than once, recurrent excitatory loops may develop or be released after the transection. Finally, plateau potentials or voltage dependent amplification due to the presence of persistent inward currents in interneurons is also likely to be involved. Previous experiments have shown that interneurons in dorsal and ventral horns may express plateau properties before (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbinanti et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Derjean et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Russo and Hounsgaard, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Theiss et al., 2007</a>) and after chronic spinal cord transection (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dougherty and Hochman, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Husch et al., 2012</a>). The mouse model offers future possibilities to selectively manipulate these properties in interneurons to understand the impact of such currents on the operation of the spinal network after SCI."

The nature of the changes underlying chronic spinal cord transection, we described here, opens up new understandings and potential new targets in treating the maladaptive state of spinal circuits after SCI. Some of the most promising pharmacological approaches for the therapeutic management of traumatic SCI seem to exert their main motor effect through a silencing of glutamatergic transmission, like riluzole (<a href=\"#bib37\">Krenz and Weaver, 1998</a>), and the different blockers of the serotonin receptors (<a href=\"#bib47\">Murray et al., 2011</a>). Indeed selective interference with glutamatergic transmission could open the possibility to dampen the persistent activity in excitatory circuits, leaving the inhibitory ones intact, as obtained with drugs currently used for antiepileptic treatment and off target for chronic pain treatment (<a href=\"#bib38\">Landmark, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sills, 2006</a>)."

Deep anesthesia was confirmed when reflexes and tail pinch responses were absent. The second sacral segment (S2) was localized at the level of the second lumbar (L2) vertebral body (<a href=\"#bib23\">Harrison et al., 2013</a>). The back of the animal was shaved and sodium iodine was applied to prevent infection. A vertical incision was made in the skin in over the spinous process of the L2 vertebral body and the muscles were cut with small eye scissor to localize the Ligamentum Flavum between the rostral part of the\u00a0L2 vertebral body and the caudal part of the\u00a0L1 vertebral body. Once the spinal cord was clearly visible, Xilocaine (1%) was applied locally on S2 before the tissue was aspirated with a small glass pipette (diameter of 100 \u00b5m), connected to a vacuum pump. Care was taken not to severe the dorsal and ventral arteries, which provide blood supply to the spinal cord below the transection. When the transection was visually seen to be complete, the muscles surrounding the spinal column were sutured to close the opening above the damaged spinal cord and to protect it from mechanical pressure. Then the skin was sutured and the animal was allowed to recover. Animals were given post-surgery treatment of Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/Kg) and Carprofen (5 mg/Kg) subcutaneously for 2 to 5 days. The injury only affects the tail muscles with no bladder or hindlimb involvement. However, animals were followed twice a day for the first week for signs of infection or change in body weight. Infections were treated with antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapy (Tribrissen, subcutaneous for 5 days). Loss of more than 20% of body weight in the post-surgery period was indication to terminate the experiments. Only animals with a complete transection of the spinal cord, visually inspected during the dissection were included in the study."

Transverse sections of the spinal cord (20 \u00b5m) were obtained using a cryostat. Sections were incubated for 24 hr at 4\u00b0C with the following primary antibodies diluted in PBS supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum and 0.5% Triton X-100: chicken anti-GFP (Aves Labs 1020; 1:2000), rabbit anti-RFP (1:1000, Rockland 600-401-379).

Slides were rinsed and mounted in Vectashield medium and scanned on a LSM5 confocal microscope (Zeiss Microsystems) using x20 or x40 objectives. Multiple channels were scanned sequentially to prevent fluorescence bleed through and false-positive signals. A contrast enhancement and a noise reduction filter were applied in Adobe Photoshop for publication images. Fluorescent in situ hybridization combined with immunofluorescence labeling was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib7\">Borgius et al., 2010</a>) using a Vglut2 probe spanning the base pairs 540\u2013983 (produced by Dr. L. Borgius). Neurons were counted on the left and right side of the spinal cord slice, using raw z-stack confocal images obtained with a 20x objective and spanning the entire thickness of the sections. Counts were done manually with the help of the cell-counter plug-in in ImageJ, in three non-adjacent sections per mice (N\u00a0=\u00a03). Cellular counts per section were expressed as a percentage of glutamatergic cells (Vglut2 mRNA positive) expressing GCaMP3\u2019 per individual animal. A grand-mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) was calculated across animals to produce bar-graphs for the different strains."

Briefly, a laminectomy at the third lumbar spinal vertebra was performed to expose the first segment of the coccygeal spinal cord. Small metal bars were used to clamp the vertebrae and kept in place by a mounting plate. The plate had a central opening over the spinal cord. The central opening was filled with silicone elastomer (World Precision Instruments). A cannula, maintained with a cannula holder on a stereotactic frame, was slowly lowered to 200 \u00b5m above the surface of the spinal cord at the level of the midline. The cannula was then secured by means of cyanoacrylate glue and dental acrylic and covered with a dust cap. The skin was sutured and the animal was allowed to recover. In vivo stimulation of spinal neurons was then performed connecting an optical fiber to the cannula with the animal: a) in a mouse restrainer (see previous section about EMGs) to evaluated and quantify the tail muscle responses with EMGs, or b) in a corridor with simultaneous high frequency camera acquisition (MotoRaterapparatus, TSE-Systems) to evaluate the overall behavioral response. Stimulations of ChR2 or eNpHR3 positive cells were obtained using a 473 nm or a 550 nm laser scanning system (UGA-40; Rapp Optoelectronic) triggered by Master 8, AMPI to deliver trains of stimuli (20 ms pulse duration, 10 Hz frequencies, and train durations of 1.5 s)."

Insights provided profoundly alter our conceptual understanding of spinal cord transection-induced motor spasms and will undoubtedly lead to new avenues of exploration in the area of clinical therapeutics. The experimental work leverages a powerful sacral spinal cord/tail animal model of motor spasms with genetic crosses in transgenic mice to undertake high throughput assessment of the role of spinal excitatory (vGluT2) and inhibitory (VIAAT) interneurons and includes imaging of their activity with the genetically encoded calcium indicator (Cre-dependent GCaMP3) and their selective activation or inhibition with light activated CHR2 or Halorhodopsin. The work provides fundamentally novel insights at many levels into the neural phenomenon and putative neural circuits underlying spinal cord transection-induced motor spasms. The study is presented with clarity and does an exceptional job of parsing and relating temporal activity in inhibitory and excitatory interneurons to the expression of persistent motor activity. There are some concerns that should be addressed to make the conclusions of the paper strong and clarify some issues."

                    "text": "\u201cThe appearance of persistent activity in spinal circuits may emerge from changes in network properties and/or biophysical properties of the spinal INs after transection. Indeed, the number of cells responding to low threshold dorsal root stimulation appeared to be much higher after chronic spinal cord transection. Possible explanations for this are that proprioceptive afferents \u2013 whose activity is important for motor recovery after spinal cord transection (Takeoaka et al. 2014; Turkay et al. 2014)- provide stronger activation of excitatory neurons due to intraspinal sprouting of proprioceptive afferents (Krenz and Weaver 1998) or due to reduced presynaptic inhibition (Kathe et al. 2016). The increased activity of excitatory interneurons may also engage mechanisms of feed-forward and/or recurrent excitation (Abbinanti et al., 2012; Wang, 2001). Feed-forward circuits among excitatory neurons may be recruited by the chronic spinal cord transection as a result of intraspinal sprouting. Moreover, since populations of eINs were activated more than once, recurrent excitatory loops may develop or be released after the transection. Finally, plateau potentials or voltage dependent amplification due to the presence of persistent inward currents in interneurons is also likely to be involved. Previous experiments have shown that interneurons in dorsal and ventral horns may express plateau properties before (Abbinanti et al., 2012; Derjean et al., 2003; Russo and Hounsgaard, 1994; Theiss et al., 2007) and after chronic spinal cord transection (Dougherty and Hochman, 2008; Husch et al., 2012). The mouse model offers future possibilities to selectively manipulate these properties in interneurons to understand the impact of such currents on the operation of the spinal network after SCI\u201d."

We have qualified the description and specifically mention the contribution of the graded expression of these properties to spasms in the, Abstract, Results and Discussion. We retain, however, that the motor neuronplateau properties, although important, may play a less pronounced role in spasm generation than previously proposed. This does not exclude that plateau properties in interneurons play a role for spasm generation."
