Despite its success, the duration of response is often limited. For previous antiandrogens, one mechanism of resistance is mutation of the androgen receptor (AR). To prospectively identify AR mutations that might confer resistance to enzalutamide, we performed a reporter-based mutagenesis screen and identified a novel mutation, F876L, which converted enzalutamide into an AR agonist. Ectopic expression of AR F876L rescued the growth inhibition of enzalutamide treatment. Molecular dynamics simulations performed on antiandrogen\u2013AR complexes suggested a mechanism by which the F876L substitution alleviates antagonism through repositioning of the coactivator recruiting helix 12. This model then provided the rationale for a focused chemical screen which, based on existing antiandrogen scaffolds, identified three novel compounds that effectively antagonized AR F876L (and AR WT) to suppress the growth of prostate cancer cells resistant to enzalutamide."

Despite its success, the duration of response is often limited. For previous antiandrogens, one mechanism of resistance is mutation of the androgen receptor (AR). To prospectively identify AR mutations that might confer resistance to enzalutamide, we performed a reporter-based mutagenesis screen and identified a novel mutation, F876L, which converted enzalutamide into an AR agonist. Ectopic expression of AR F876L rescued the growth inhibition of enzalutamide treatment. Molecular dynamics simulations performed on antiandrogen\u2013AR complexes suggested a mechanism by which the F876L substitution alleviates antagonism through repositioning of the coactivator recruiting helix 12. This model then provided the rationale for a focused chemical screen which, based on existing antiandrogen scaffolds, identified three novel compounds that effectively antagonized AR F876L (and AR WT) to suppress the growth of prostate cancer cells resistant to enzalutamide."

All stages of prostate cancer depend upon male sex hormones, also known as androgens, to grow because these hormones bind and activate androgen receptors. A class of drugs termed \u2018antiandrogens\u2019 can effectively treat prostate cancer because they bind to androgen receptors without activating them, thereby preventing androgens from binding. However, the efficacy of even highly potent antiandrogen drugs, such as enzalutamide is short-lived in many patients, and understanding the biological mechanisms that cause drug resistance is one of the major objectives in translational prostate cancer research."

However, no such mutations are known yet for enzalutamide, and researchers are keen to understand whether they exist and, if so, to generate new drugs for prostate cancer that overcome them. To identify mutations that may lead to resistance, Balbas et al. designed a new screening method in human prostate cancer cells and showed that androgen receptors with a specific mutation (called F876L) can be activated by enzalutamide. More comprehensive biological studies showed that prostate cancer cells harboring the mutation continued to grow when treated with the drug. Balbas et al. also showed that this mutation can arise spontaneously in human prostate cancer cells treated long term with enzalutamide."

These studies indicated that the region of the androgen receptor containing the F876L mutation comes into direct contact with the drug, and provided a structural explanation for the loss of inhibition. Because these studies showed how enzalutamide might bind to the androgen receptor, they also suggested ways in which enzalutamide could be chemically modified to restore its inhibitory activity against the mutant receptor."

In spite of these promising results, patient responses to enzalutamide are varied and often short lived. Reactivation of AR signaling has been implicated in resistance to previous antiandrogen therapy (<a href=\"#bib28\">Linja et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2004</a>), and one well-documented mechanism of reactivation is point mutation in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of AR (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bergerat and Ceraline, 2009</a>). Many of these mutations broaden ligand specificity, and some confer resistance by converting the AR antagonist into an agonist of the mutant receptor (<a href=\"#bib38\">Veldscholte et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Haapala et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hara et al., 2003</a>). Because previous work with targeted therapies that inhibit oncogenic kinases has shown that unbiased mutagenesis screens in preclinical models can identify a priori clinically relevant mutations that alter drug activity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Azam et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Burgess et al., 2005</a>), we designed a novel screening method to prospectively identify AR mutations that confer resistance to enzalutamide."

Cells expressing drug-resistant kinase alleles selectively expand in the presence of drug, allowing rapid identification of mutations that confer drug resistance. There is no comparable strategy available for antiandrogens because introduction of AR does not confer a comparable growth advantage in AR-negative cells. We instead chose to identify and select cell populations with persistent AR transcriptional activity in the presence of enzalutamide. We reasoned that targeting the biological process of interest (transcriptional activation of a target gene), rather than a distal symptom of resistance to drug (i.e., persistent viability, elevated proliferation) might identify resistant clones more quickly. To this end, an AR-regulated EGFP reporter, with a probasin promoter and PSA enhancer elements driving EGFP expression (Pb.PSE.EGFP) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chapel-Fernandes et al., 2006</a>), was used to screen for and enrich cell populations bearing biologically active mutations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

With starting ratios of 1:100 and 1:1000 cells overexpressing AR W741C to wild-type AR, respectively, we sorted cells with FACS that maintained EGFP expression after acute bicalutamide exposure. After four rounds of bicalutamide \u2018selection\u2019 and sorting, LNCaP cells expressing AR W741C dominated the final populations (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Moreover, enzalutamide promoted AR transcriptional activity in these cells, reflected by induction of EGFP expression compared to vehicle control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Analysis of endogenous AR target gene expression confirmed that enzalutamide behaved as an agonist in the enriched cell population (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and siRNA knockdown of AR showed that these pharmacologically induced changes remained AR dependent (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>)."

We also introduced AR F876L cDNA into AR-negative CV1 cells along with an AR-dependent luciferase construct, and upon enzalutamide treatment, luciferase activity was induced \u223c50-fold (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These results were comparable to those seen with the previously reported AR mutations T877A and W741C, which confer agonism to hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide, respectively. Moreover, enzalutamide treatment potently induced nuclear localization of AR F876L (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that enzalutamide recruited AR F876L to the enhancers of AR target genes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Consistent with these results, endogenous AR target gene expression was either no longer repressed by enzalutamide (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, left) or strongly induced by enzalutamide in cells expressing AR F876L (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right).

                                "text": "(<b>A</b>) A representative FACS histogram shows the induction of AR-dependent EGFP expression by enzalutamide in LNCaP-Pb.PSE.EGFP cells ectopically expressing AR F876L. The magnitude of induction by enzalutamide (10 \u03bcM) is comparable to that conferred by the endogenous androgen DHT (1 nM). Enzalutamide treatment of LNCaP-Pb.PSE.EGFP cells ectopically expressing AR WT effectively suppressed EGFP expression. Geometric-mean fluorescence intensity for WT treated cells: vehicle (348), enzalutamide (66.4), DHT (1554); for F876L cells: vehicle (345), enzalutamide (1051), DHT (1699). (<b>B</b>) Cotransduction of CV1 cells with an AR-regulated firefly luciferase construct, a constitutive Renilla luciferase construct, and one of the indicated AR constructs, recapitulates the pharmacology observed in the EGFP reporter system. These cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), antiandrogens (1 \u03bcM), or the synthetic androgen R1881 (1 nM). A dual luciferase assay was conducted on cell lysates, the firefly signal was normalized to the constitutive Renilla activity, and the data are reported as relative light units (RLUs). Notably, the bisaryl-thiohydantoin antiandrogens (enzalutamide and ARN-509) effectively induce AR F876L transcriptional activity, while structurally discrete antiandrogens (hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide) do not impact AR F876L activity in this assay. As expected, the transcriptional activity of AR W741C or AR T877A was induced by bicalutamide or hydroxyflutamide, respectively. (<b>C</b>) Quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction analysis of LNCaP/AR F876L cells shows that enzalutamide (1 \u03bcM) can induce the expression of canonical AR-regulated gene products (i.e., <i>PSA</i>, <i>TMPRSS2</i>, <i>SGK1</i>, and <i>FKBP5</i>). Relative gene expression post therapy for LNCaP/AR WT cells is included as positive controls. FL = AR F876L, data are normalized to GAPDH and represented as mean \u00b1 SD, <i>n</i> = 3. (<b>D</b>) Cell proliferation data shows that overexpression of AR F876L in a human prostate cancer cell line sensitive to enzalutamide therapy can rescue cell growth. VCaP cells overexpressing either AR WT (solid lines) or AR F876L (dashed lines) were cultured in media containing full serum, treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or 10 \u03bcM enzalutamide, and the viable cell fraction was determined at the indicated time points (data is represented as mean \u00b1 SD, <i>n</i> = 3). (<b>E</b>) Cellular proliferation data shows that enzalutamide also rescues the growth of VCaP cells expressing AR F876L in androgen-depleted media. VCaP cells overexpressing either AR WT (solid lines) or AR F876L (dashed lines) were treated with vehicle (DMSO), 1 nM DHT, or 10 \u03bcM enzalutamide, and the viable cell fraction was determined at the indicated time points (mean \u00b1 SD, <i>n</i> = 3). (<b>F</b>) A time to progression study for mice bearing subcutaneous LNCaP/AR-WT (solid lines) or LNCaP/AR-F876L (dashed lines) xenografts further highlights the genotype-dependent pharmacology of enzalutamide. Inoculated animals were treated once daily through oral gavage with either vehicle or enzalutamide (30 mg/kg), and tumor size was monitored weekly (11\u201316 tumors per treatment group). While enzalutamide potently suppressed the growth of LNCaP/AR-WT tumors, LNCaP/AR-F876L tumors exposed to enzalutamide grew with kinetics roughly equivalent to either vehicle treatment arm.

                        "text": "The docked enzalutamide and ARN-509 molecules demonstrated strikingly different interaction patterns with AR compared to bicalutamide (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Notably, the thiohydantoin B-ring prevents the compound from accessing the \u2018H12 pocket\u2019 occupied by bicalutamide. Instead, the conformationally restricted thiohydantoin forces the C-ring to bind a region near the C terminus of helix 11 and the loop connecting helices 11 and 12, that we termed the \u2018H11 pocket\u2019. As seen in the MD simulations using the WT receptor with enzalutamide and ARN-509 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a> [in red], <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), accommodation of the C-ring in this region is coupled to significant conformational rearrangements of residues on H11 and the H11\u2013H12 connecting loop that prevents H12 from adopting the agonist conformation required for efficient coactivator recruitment. To investigate how the F876L mutation might alleviate antagonism, we performed similar MD simulations using the F876L receptor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a> [in cyan], <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For WT receptors in complex with enzalutamide and ARN-509, the average RMSDs to the crystal agonist conformation for the helix 11 terminus (residues 875\u2013882) were measured at 2.24 and 1.94 \u00c5, respectively, and those for the helix 12 terminus (residues 893\u2013900) were 1.81 and 2.08 \u00c5, respectively. For the F876L mutants, in comparison, the average RMSDs for helix 11 were somewhat lower at 1.01 and 1.70 \u00c5 for enzalutamide and ARN-509, respectively, and those for helix 12 went down to 1.37 \u00c5 for both ligands. The results demonstrate that despite inducing similar dislocations in the H11 pocket, the mutation allows the receptor to reposition H12 in a more agonist-like conformation that is compatible with coactivator recruitment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A close look in the H11 pocket (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>) indicated the following: (1) F876 in AR WT likely interacts with the C-ring end of enzalutamide or ARN-509 through favorable pi stacking or van der Waals contacts, and (2) the loss of such favorable contacts upon F876L mutation concurrently affects the conformational choices of helices 11 and 12, which interact through both bonded and nonbonded forces. Importantly, these structural modeling results are consistent with the differential resistance profiles for enzalutamide and bicalutamide involving residues 741 and 876, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

Moreover, the steric girth of the substituent appeared to impact the positioning of H12, as the bulkier spirocyclobutyl moiety on ARN-509 elicited greater H12 displacements in AR WT than did enzalutamide's gem-dimethyl group (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

Moreover, a compound with gem-dimethyl groups at the 3 and 5 positions of the D-ring (DR105) inhibited AR F876L (and AR WT) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), further underscoring the biological importance of the steric interactions brought about by these moieties in the context of the mutant receptor.

We interpret this result to be supportive of the model advanced by the previous MD simulations, as the F876L substitution appeared to impact the ability of enzalutamide and ARN-509 to induce H12 conformational choices in a roughly equivalent manner. Finally, to underscore the importance of the steric interactions conferred by the D-ring, we synthesized DR107, a compound built on the enzalutamide scaffold bearing only hydrogen atoms at position 4 on the B-ring.

With its recent approval, the case for defining mechanisms that overcome enzalutamide therapy is timely and compelling. Because AR mutations are a cause of clinical resistance to antiandrogens (flutamide and bicalutamide) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Veldscholte et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Haapala et al., 2001</a>), and previous work has shown that clinically relevant mutations can be discovered from screening platforms in preclinical models, we prospectively searched for such mutations in the context of enzalutamide using a novel saturation mutagenesis approach. This screen revealed that mutation of Phe 876 to Leu converts enzalutamide and ARN-509 into AR agonists and confers resistance to drug-induced growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, this mutation was also recovered \u2018spontaneously\u2019 from enzalutamide-sensitive cell line and xenograft models treated with prolonged enzalutamide therapy."

Using MD simulations, a novel binding mode for the drug was identified, which provided a compelling explanation for how antagonism is retained against the bicalutamide-resistant Trp 741 mutation. More importantly, the MD simulations argued that an altered spatial orientation of enzalutamide within the AR LBD might explain the onset of agonism, as the F876L mutation appeared to reposition the drug to eliminate steric clashes that promoted H12 dislocation in AR WT. Reassuringly, several larger compounds that the MD simulations predicted could restore H12 dislocation (the \u2018D-ring\u2019 series) effectively antagonized AR F876L."

As for the potential clinical impact of a priori discovery of drug\u2013resistance mutations to novel cancer drugs, our previous experience with the ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia serves as an example. Within 2 years of reporting dasatinib-resistant mutations in BCR-ABL in a preclinical model, analogous mutations were recovered from dasatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia patients (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burgess et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Shah et al., 2007</a>). We hope that this report will guide a similar search for AR mutations in prostate cancer patients who develop clinical resistance to enzalutamide. Routine rebiopsy of tumor tissue in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer is challenging due to the high frequency of osteoblastic bone lesions consisting primarily of stromal tissue. Blood-based assays for AR mutation detection may be a compelling alternative, based on recent success in detection of tumor-specific mutations in circulating plasma DNA from patients with other cancers (<a href=\"#bib16\">Diehl et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Leary et al., 2012</a>)."

Starting with the atomic coordinates of AR WT and the A-ring of S1 in the template crystal structure (PDB accession code, 2AXA), the side chain of residue F876 was replaced with CHARMm22-parameterized side chain of a leucine when needed and the CH group on the A-ring was replaced with a nitrogen in cases of ARN-509. The rest of each antiandrogen was \u2018grown\u2019 from the A-ring using the ideal unbound structures solved by geometry optimization. Missing side chain atoms were built using standard CHARMm22 parameters and hydrogen atoms were added with the HBUILD (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brunger and Karplus, 1998</a>) module of CHARMM. All these newly introduced atoms without three-dimensional crystal coordinates treated flexible and the rest under harmonic constraints with the force constant of 100 kcal/mol/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, each AR\u2013antiandrogen complex structure was energetically minimized with one round of 100-step steepest decent followed by two rounds of 100-step Adopted-Basis Newton\u2013Raphson (ABNR) energy minimization. Harmonic constraints were reset at the beginning of each round of minimization. No nonbonded cutoff was used. Solvent effects were implicitly modeled in this stage with a distance-dependent dielectric constant."

Each initial AR\u2013antiandrogen model was first centered and overlaid with a rhombic dodecahedron-shaped water box (edge length being 88 \u00c5) of approximately 47,000 equilibrated water molecules. Any water molecule whose oxygen atom was within 2.8 \u00c5 away from any non-hydrogen atom of AR or antiandrogen was removed. Proper amount of sodium and chloride ions were automatically added to achieve overall charge neutrality and physiological level of ion concentration (0.145 M). Their positions were optimized with 10 independent trajectories of randomly replacing water molecules and performing 50 steps of steepest decent and 125 steps of ABNR energy minimization."

After the MD equilibration, three sets of random velocities were assigned to initiate three independent 10-ns MD productions. The MD equilibration and production were performed using the crystal form of rhombic dodecahedron (RHDO) and the canonical ensemble (NVT). A nonbonded cutoff of 14 \u00c5, periodic boundary conditions in conjunction with Ewald summation method, the leapfrog Verlet integrator, and the Hoover thermostat for pressure and temperature were used. The timestep was set at 2 fs. Parallel jobs for MD simulations were run on a computer cluster of Intel Xeon X5650 series (2.66 GHz and 4 GB memory per CPU)."

Using structural modeling and simulation, the authors design a series of compounds, some of which show inhibitory activity against the mutated form of AR, and could have potential as new anti-androgen drugs."

After deliberation, this experiment was considered not necessary for publication given the overall depth of the studies, but it would further strengthen the manuscript if available."

As for binding affinity, we have included a competitive binding experiment with radiolabeled DHT in cells expressing the WT or mutant receptor, showing increased affinity of enzalutamide for F876L (comparable to DHT affinity), consistent with conversion to agonism (new figure: Figure 2\u2013 figure supplement 3)."

For example, bicalutamide is clearly not an agonist for F876L under the androgen-deprived conditions in which enzalutamide is. However, in the presence of androgen, bicalutamide at low concentrations has modest antagonist activity (as measured by our GFP reporter) that is lost at higher concentrations, presumably due to the well-documented agonism of bicalutamide against WT AR when expressed at high levels. Finally, bicalutamide has minimal antagonist activity against mutant-expressing cells in growth assays. These data are now added in a new figure (Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 8) and in a new paragraph in the Results. Our conclusion from all of this is that bicalutamide is highly unlikely to provide a clinical solution to the F876L mutant; hence, the rationale for DR103."
