Here, we demonstrate how spectral confocal microscopy, typically reserved for fluorescent imaging, can be used to visualize metal-labeled tissues. This imaging does not involve the reflectance of metal particles, but rather the excitation of silver (or gold) nanoparticles and their putative surface plasmon resonance. To induce such resonance, silver or gold particles were excited with visible-wavelength laser lines (561 or 640 nm), and the maximal emission signal was collected at a shorter wavelength (i.e., higher energy state). Because the surface plasmon resonances of noble metal nanoparticles offer a superior optical signal and do not photobleach, our novel protocol holds enormous promise of a rebirth and further development of silver- and gold-based cell labeling protocols."

Here, we demonstrate how spectral confocal microscopy, typically reserved for fluorescent imaging, can be used to visualize metal-labeled tissues. This imaging does not involve the reflectance of metal particles, but rather the excitation of silver (or gold) nanoparticles and their putative surface plasmon resonance. To induce such resonance, silver or gold particles were excited with visible-wavelength laser lines (561 or 640 nm), and the maximal emission signal was collected at a shorter wavelength (i.e., higher energy state). Because the surface plasmon resonances of noble metal nanoparticles offer a superior optical signal and do not photobleach, our novel protocol holds enormous promise of a rebirth and further development of silver- and gold-based cell labeling protocols."

To study the neurons and other cells in the brain, scientists must therefore first prepare tissue samples using methods that make it easier to see certain kinds of cells, or particular features of them. One method that has been available for over a century is to use metal particles to stain some of the cells. For example, when the Spanish anatomist Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal investigated how brain cells \u2013 or neurons \u2013 are organized in the brain in the late 1880s, he made the cells visible by staining them with silver. This silver staining technique, called the Golgi method, bears the name of Camillo Golgi who first discovered it. Both Golgi and Ram\u00f3n y Cajal are considered to be the pioneers of neuroscience, and shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906."

Light travels in the form of waves, and different colors of light have different wavelengths (the distance between the peaks of the wave). Shining light of one specific color onto a fluorescent probe causes it to emit light of a longer wavelength. By detecting this emitted light, it is possible to visualize structures that contain the probes. In the late 1980s, the invention of the laser-scanning confocal microscope allowed highly detailed three-dimensional reconstructions of individual neurons to be obtained using these fluorescent labels."

Traditional silver stains avoid this problem, but standard confocal microscopy cannot obtain good images from metal-stained cells. Now, Thompson, Harley et al. have overcome this problem by using the confocal microscope in a new way to detect emitted light with shorter wavelengths than the light that was initially absorbed (rather than the longer wavelength light normally detected). This protocol produced highly detailed three-dimensional images of individual metal-stained neurons that had been impregnated with silver or gold particles."

When plasmons absorb radiation of a specific wavelength, they vibrate rapidly and emit their excess energy in the form of light. Medieval craftsmen unknowingly exploited this same phenomenon when they added silver and gold particles to molten stained glass, producing windows with vivid red and yellow colors that are still vibrant today."

For reasons still unknown, only a random subset of neurons became labeled in their entirety, leading to our understanding that the nervous system is largely composed of individual cells separated by synapses. Although the Golgi method, which involves the deposition of silver, allowed for unprecedented insight into the morphological features of neurons, subsequent methods were developed so that specific neurons of interest could be characterized. For example, targeted neurons were filled with cobalt or nickel ions, and later intensified through the deposition of silver (<a href=\"#bib24\">Pitman et al., 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tyrer and Bell, 1974</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib20\">Mesce et al., 1993a</a>). Eventually, the popularity of metal-filling and silver intensification methods gave way to the development and use of fluorescent compounds to label neurons (<a href=\"#bib33\">Stretton and Kravitz, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Stewart, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mesce et al., 1993b</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Vitzthum et al., 1996)</a>.

With repeated laser imaging, however, a number of fluorophores in wide use showed susceptibility to photobleaching, thus lessening the ability of fluorescently\u00a0labeled samples to be archived and repeatedly imaged over time."

To this end, we discovered a novel strategy that permits the imaging of metal-impregnated cells with the LSCM. Silver- or gold-labeled neurons were imaged by using a method whereby the laser-induced photon emission, from any given sample, was captured at its higher energy state (shorter wavelength) as compared to the laser wavelength used to excite the metal-impregnated samples. This phenomenon can be used in the presence of high background fluorescence, and contrasts with conventional fluorescence microscopy whereby the emitted photons are of a longer wavelength (i.e. lower energy state). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the energy emitted after laser excitation is based on the phenomenon of silver (or gold) local surface plasmon resonance (<a href=\"#bib40\">Willets and Van Duyne, 2007</a>) and not metallic reflectance or fluorescence."

We predict that an enormous reservoir of Golgi and other silver-stained nervous systems, from a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, can now be mined and easily imaged in their entirety. With the advent of enzyme metallography, these samples too can be visualized with unparalleled detail and reconstructed in three dimensions.

First, a conventional brightfield image of a labeled neuron within a female abdominal ganglion of a grasshopper is presented. The cell body, neurites, axon and fine branching pattern can be seen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). However, this photomicrograph underscores the basic problem of brightfield microscopy when trying to illustrate the 3D structure of an entire neuron. First, the depth of focus is short relative to the size of the neuron. Second, the out-of-focus branches obscure the in-focus portions of the neuron. Thus, studies of cobalt-filled neurons are usually presented as camera Lucida tracings in which the cell\u2019s processes at all depths of focus are traced by hand onto paper (not shown); such drawings do not retain depth information. Stacked images from brightfield microscopy offer the promise of improvement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>), but they too often lack the detail obtained using the LSCM."

We then measured the emissions over a three-decade range of wavelengths with a spectral detector (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). To compare the signal intensity across images and imaging types, we used a selection of four images from the scan and measured the emission intensity of both the region of interest (ROI) and the background (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). By taking a ratio of the intensity of the ROI and the background, we were able to calculate relative intensity and compare data across samples. In addition, all samples compared were acquired using a similar laser power setting (90% for the 561nm excitation, 100% for all other excitation wavelengths), pinhole size (1.2AU), and gain (120 for 561 nm, and 115 for all other excitations).

The second peak in the graph occurred where we had slightly higher noise but a much higher signal, resulting in greater imaging success when the signal was collected from 490\u2013530 nm. With the short-wavelength detection setting of 490\u2013530 nm, and a laser excitation setting of 561\u00a0nm, a bright neuron against a dark and low noise background emerged."

To examine this possibility, we looked at a number of histological preparations that had used different metals and impregnation techniques to characterize neuronal morphologies. Some neurons were: 1) filled with cobalt but had no silver intensification; 2) stained with silver but contained no cobalt (e.g. Golgi, reduced silver and Gallyas stains) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gallyas et al., 1980)</a>; 3) stained with gold (Bodian\u2019s stain). Our findings indicate that silver or another noble metal such as gold was required. Cobalt alone produced poor-quality images, regardless of the excitation laser selected for use (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Golgi stains of different brain regions from different species were also imaged, for example, the insect optic lobe (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>), mammalian pyramidal cell (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>), and mouse Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>), all of which yielded high\u00a0quality confocal images (excitation laser of 561 nm and detection of 430\u2013740 nm). In addition, the Gallyas-stained sample (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>), the amino-cupric silver stained one (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a>), and the gold-based Bodian\u2019s stain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>) all produced quality neural images. The graph to the right of each set of images shows a plot that, essentially, indicates the signal-to-noise ratio for each sample. For images shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013f</a>, the best ratio in all samples occurred at 450 nm, and a secondary peak was located just above 500 nm. The insets of each plot show overall intensity of the signal in black and the background signal in gray. From these plots it is clear, however, that the high signal intensity just to the left of the excitation wavelength decreases to a lower value near 430 nm. Because of the lower signal in the 440\u2013480 nm range, it is more reliable to detect the signal in the range of 490\u2013530 nm."

                        "text": "In this study, we showed that the LSCM can be utilized to capture photons for image formation emitted by silver- or gold-impregnated neuronal specimens. Our analysis identified two constraints on imaging. One was that the microscope\u2019s longer wavelength laser lines (561 nm or 640 nm) were required for excitation. The second was that wavelength detection settings needed to be shorter, in the range of 440\u2013530 nm. This relationship between stimulating wavelength and collecting wavelength contrasted with those involving fluorescent dyes. For example, fluorophores excited with a 561-nm laser line emit photons with wavelengths in the range of 570\u2013610 nm, due to energy loss during the fluorescence energy transfer (Stokes Law). In fact, many LSCMs utilize filter assemblies that routinely filter out emission wavelengths shorter than the excitation laser line, thus preventing the type of capture we have outlined here."

                        "text": "The explanation, we believe, for both the presence of photic emissions from our silver and gold preparations and for the fact that they are of higher energy than the excitation wavelength, is the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance. Plasmons are coherently\u00a0oscillating free electrons on the surface of noble metal nanoparticles, such as silver and gold\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib40\">Willets and Van Duyne, 2007)</a>. When the vector of incident light matches the oscillations of plasmons, there is an interaction or resonance, thus the term surface plasmon resonance\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib40\">Willets and Van Duyne, 2007)</a>. Different sizes and shapes of plasmonic silver and gold nanoparticles, and their spacing, will produce different resonances that can vary in wavelength across the visible light range and the infrared. Photons can either be scattered in all directions by plasmonic nanoparticles or absorbed and transferred into heat or luminescence\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib41\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib26\">Rycenga et al., 2011)</a>. Of the noble metals and copper, known to exhibit plasmon resonance in the visible light range, silver is the most efficient for light capture. For example, a single nanoparticle can interact with 10 times more light than is physically incident upon it; thus, a silver nanoparticle is more efficient than any similarly sized chromophore (<a href=\"#bib26\">Rycenga et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib8\">Evanoff and Chumanov, 2005)</a>. Excitation and emission photons are not related in a one-for-one ratio, but rather, the excitation laser line (longer wavelength) provides the energy input necessary to sustain the plasmonic light-emitting state of the metallic nanoparticles. The optical changes are large because of the strong interactions of light with noble metals (<a href=\"#bib8\">Evanoff and Chumanov, 2005)</a>. While silver and gold are known to support surface plasmons at visible wavelengths, cobalt emits inefficiently in the 300 nm range\u2014outside the collection wavelength setting available on the LSCM we used (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kaminskien\u0117 et al., 2013)</a>. Thus, the hypothesis that our silver- and gold-impregnated samples can be imaged as a consequence of surface plasmon resonance is supported by the fact that cobalt alone did not result in an emission in the visible light range (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5g</a>). Furthermore, the wavelength observed for silver and cobalt/silver nanoparticle plasmonic emissions is in the range of 440\u2013530 nm\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib8\">Evanoff and Chumanov, 2005)</a>, providing further support for our hypothesis."

The use of plasmon-related technology is rapidly expanding in the biological fields and for other applications (<a href=\"#bib6\">Downs-Kelly et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Fan et al., 2014)</a>. Metal nanoparticles are wavelength-tunable for enhanced optical contrast, they can be tagged with antibodies, and can serve as molecular sensors (<a href=\"#bib36\">Turzhitsky et al., 2014)</a>. One particularly interesting application involves cell labeling with nanoparticles coupled to fluorescent dyes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Koyama and Tophyama, 2013)</a>. Significant plasmonic enhancement of fluorescent dyes is observed, apparently the result of increased fluorophore stability permitting longer probing times with higher excitation energy; noble metal nanoparticle plasmons can enhance the signaling of fluorophores by two orders of magnitude or more creating exceptionally bright labels (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jain et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Demchenko, 2013)</a>. It has also been shown that fluorophore-conjugated antibodies can be used to colabel antigens in cobalt-filled Timm\u2019s silver-intensified nervous system preparations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Moos, 1993)</a>, indicating that such preparations and others could be imaged with our new method and simultaneously with traditional ones appropriate for the emissions of the fluorescent antibody."

In contrast to most fluorophores, however, silver and gold nanoparticles do not photobleach and have higher extinction coefficients\u2014they can also be imaged with super-resolution microscopy methods and electron beams that surpass the ca. 200 nm diffraction resolution limit of a conventional LSCM <a href=\"#bib42\">(Zhang et al., 2015)</a>. Recently, local plasmon resonance and enhanced dark-field illumination, based on wavelength modulation, has resolved the coordinates of 80 nm silver nanoparticles with a 2.9 nm precision (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zhang et al., 2015)</a>. Because silver and gold nanoparticle plasmon resonance can generate a high signal to noise ratio (i.e. is bright), silver-labeled specimens like the ones we imaged have the potential to reveal structures at the nanometer scale when imaged with super-resolution microscopy methods. Although we have yet to determine the sizes and shapes of the silver nanoparticles deposited on the neurons we imaged, spectral and theoretical consideration should reveal such information (<a href=\"#bib38\">Verbruggen et al., 2013)</a>. By chemically controlling the sizes and shapes of silver or gold nanoparticles deposited on neuronal surfaces, the intensity and spectral characteristics of such cells could be customized and enhanced (<a href=\"#bib8\">Evanoff and Chumanov, 2005)</a>."

Note that cobalt was used to backfill the insect neurons in this study. The cobalt was first precipitated as CoS that then served as the nucleus for silver deposition in the Timm's silver intensification procedure (see Methods). In traditional Golgi staining, black microcrystals of silver chromate form in stained cells, and these too have impressive longevity in excess of 90 years."

By using the cobalt-silver intensification technique in combination with our LSCM protocols, new preparations can also be generated and imaged with ease, precision, and with great detail in three dimensions. Such preparations are essentially permanent, and the information gathered from them increases the data available for characterizing neurons as individuals or as members of classes for comparative studies, adding to emerging neural information banks (<a href=\"#bib23\">Parekh and Ascoli, 2013)</a>. This archivability also promises to benefit clinical research and disease-related diagnostic techniques. Finally, just as plasmon resonance can explain the continued intensity of the red (use of silver nanoparticles) and yellow (gold nanoparticles) colors found in centuries-old medieval stained glass and other works of art (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sciau, 2012)</a>, metal-impregnated neurons too will likely never fade, neither in their information content nor in their intrinsic beauty."

Even though there was no danger of photobleaching the sample, laser power was adjusted to avoid over saturation of the image during data acquisition. Spectral confocal imaging facilitates the capture of the up-converted signal, but it is not required for our new protocol as the\u00a0plasmon resonance signal can be captured at wavelengths shorter than the 561-nm laser line excitation used in this study. The reflective and fluorescence default modes on a conventional non-spectral LSCM are suboptimal as they will catch only the tails of the peak of the signal. Although the excitation laser lines of 561 and 640 nm are standard on many LSCMs, the optical filter sets to capture light shorter than the excitation wavelength are not standard. If the LSCM were not tunable to detect up-conversion, a spectral detector or optical setup would need to be procured from the manufacturer of a given confocal microscope."

Additional spectral separation was performed using the Nikon Elements software on images where indicated within the figure legends. Where side views of confocal preparations were seen, these images were rotated using the software package Imaris.\u00a0For the 3D rendering in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, image stacks were opened in Nikon Elements software and plasmon resonance channels were unmixed and the resulting channels selected and extracted from the spectral image. Additionally, one channel composed of autofluorescence (longer wavelength) from the ganglion was extracted to provide spatial context to the volume rendering. Each channel was exported in TIFF format and scaled to 8-bit depth. Images demonstrating plasmon resonance were opened in FIJI. Tools for \u2018oval\u2019, \u2018rectangle\u2019 or \u2018freehand\u2019 were used to select ROI in the images. The command \u2018fill\u2019 or \u2018clear outside\u2019 were then utilized to keep signal within the selected ROI or to discard signal outside of the ROI. Criteria for selection of a ROI included signal from the perineurial sheath as well as other signals that obscured motoneuron branches in 3D and orthogonal views. This method was done for all optical sections in the stack as well as for each extracted channel, autofluorescence channel excluded. All extracted channels were then merged into a single multichannel TIFF image. The resulting image was then pseudocolored in Elements. The autofluorescence channel and plasmon resonance channels were assigned unique color LUTS. For <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, plasmon resonance channels were pseudocolored yellow and the autofluorescence channel was pseudocolored blue. Images were imported into Imaris software, and 3D renderings were created using the Surpass view. Orthogonal images were obtained using the \u2018Snapshot\u2019 feature. Animations were generated in Imaris by inserting a key frame and a corresponding 360 degree horizontal rotation (Mode = Maximum intensity projection, Rendering Quality = 1.000, Frame= no).

Using a LSCM, an instrument that is widely available, images from such impregnated neurons can be captured by collecting emissions at shorter wavelengths than used for excitation. Spectral analysis indicates that signal to background and image quality is maximized by excitation laser line of 561 nm and collecting emissions between 490-530 nm. Archived silver impregnated specimens are imaged at high quality. The observation that emission is largest at shorter wavelengths than excitation and that cobalt impregnated neurons are not imaged well while silver or gold ones are, suggests that the plasmon resonance associated emission underlies the imaging technique developed. The analysis appears carefully done and the data and images presented are convincing."

                    "text": "We initially made the claim that silver emissions offer greater spatial resolution, because silver nanoparticle plasmon resonance is known to have a high signal-to-background ratio and extinction coefficient, and thus is more detectable (bright). This detectability enables small anatomical features to be more easily seen and imaged. In retrospect, we should have used the term \u201cdetectability\u201d and not spatial resolution; thus we have modified our original assertion throughout the revised manuscript. Depending on objective lenses, light sources and mounting medium used, the diffraction limits of resolution for conventional microscopy, including the LSCM, are between 150-200 nm. The spectral LSCM we used cannot determine whether small neuronal fibers, for example, from a silver-stained preparation versus a fluorophore-labeled one are any better resolved below ca. 200 nm. Both silver- and fluorophore-labeling methods can offer high quality images using the LSCM as now stated in the text (paragraph four, Discussion). However, because the labeling we present involves metal particles, instead of less bright photo-bleachable fluorophores, such specimens can be probed with electron beams and newer super-resolution techniques that may well indicate that sub-cellular anatomical features can be better resolved using silver nanoparticles as compared to traditional fluorophores. Because such studies are beyond the scope of our report here, we have opted not to state that our image resolution is better than fluorescent labeling. In addition, we have added a section in the Discussion that presents the potential of super-resolution microscopy techniques for imaging silver or gold nanoparticles (paragraph four, Discussion)."
