However, the understanding of their <i>in vivo</i> physiological action remains limited, partly due to the complexity in channel types and scarcity of genetic models. Here we report that <i>C. elegans</i> LGC-46, a member of the Cys-loop acetylcholine (ACh)-gated chloride (ACC) channel family, localizes to presynaptic terminals of cholinergic motor neurons and regulates synaptic vesicle (SV) release kinetics upon evoked release of acetylcholine. Loss of <i>lgc-46</i> prolongs evoked release, without altering spontaneous activity. Conversely, a gain-of-function mutation of <i>lgc-46</i> shortens evoked release to reduce synaptic transmission. This inhibition of presynaptic release requires the anion selectivity of LGC-46, and can ameliorate cholinergic over-excitation in a <i>C. elegans</i> model of excitation-inhibition imbalance. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism of presynaptic negative feedback in which an anion-selective LGIC acts as an auto-receptor to inhibit SV release."
