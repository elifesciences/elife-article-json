It has long been assumed that discovering neuron types and their relation to microcircuitry is crucial to understanding neural function. Here we developed a non-parametric Bayesian technique that identifies neuron types and microcircuitry patterns in connectomics data. It combines the information traditionally used by biologists in a principled and probabilistically coherent manner, including connectivity, cell body location, and the spatial distribution of synapses. We show that the approach recovers known neuron types in the retina and enables predictions of connectivity, better than simpler algorithms. It also can reveal interesting structure in the nervous system of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and an old man-made microprocessor. Our approach extracts structural meaning from connectomics, enabling new approaches of automatically deriving anatomical insights from these emerging datasets."

It has long been assumed that discovering neuron types and their relation to microcircuitry is crucial to understanding neural function. Here we developed a non-parametric Bayesian technique that identifies neuron types and microcircuitry patterns in connectomics data. It combines the information traditionally used by biologists in a principled and probabilistically coherent manner, including connectivity, cell body location, and the spatial distribution of synapses. We show that the approach recovers known neuron types in the retina and enables predictions of connectivity, better than simpler algorithms. It also can reveal interesting structure in the nervous system of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and an old man-made microprocessor. Our approach extracts structural meaning from connectomics, enabling new approaches of automatically deriving anatomical insights from these emerging datasets."

We thus simulate data for which we know the correct structure and compare the estimated structure based on the algorithm (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) with the one we used for simulation. We find that the model does a good job of recovering the correct number of cell types (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), the cell identities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), and the spatial extent of each type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). For comparison, we show the results using the infinite stochastic block model (iSBM) instead (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>, black line) which assumes that only cell type matters, and thus finds small neighborhoods of connected nodes (instead of global connectivity patterns). This contrast shows that while the regular block model can not correctly deal with distance-dependent connectivity, our model can. Our model converges relatively quickly (see 'Mixing of Markov chains') to an estimate of the most probable values for the cell types, which is enabled by using a combination of simulated annealing and parallelized Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). Thus our model at least is promising for application to biological datasets."

Consequently, many connections to cells outside that tissue volume will be lost. We are concerned that this selective elimination of connectivity along the boundary might give the appearance of distance-dependent connectivity when there is none. We thus performed simulations to check if edge effects could destroy spatial structure and if edge effects could introduce artificial, spurious spatial structure. We measure the degree to which distance-dependent effects can arise from selecting regions that are smaller than the \u2018scale\u2019 of connectivity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We do this by generating two collections of synthetic datasets\u2014one with distance-dependent connectivity and one without. We then in each dataset randomly examine contiguous circular regions with area varying from zero to the entire volume, and empirically calculate the spatial variance in type-dependent connectivity. We find that, if there is no distance dependence, edge effects do not artificially introduce distance dependence. However, if the section we are examining is too small, our model can miss the distance dependence. Thus with respect to distance-dependent connectivity inference, our model errs on the side of caution. But we also find that for spatial extent that is similar to the currently available datasets, the effects of this are quite limited."

As such, the work is considered to be very timely. However, it was also felt that it is unclear how the algorithm works and what its limitations might be. A more careful description and presentation of the method with added discussions is strongly needed. In other words, does the method actually work? As presented, it seems magical and impressive, and there was some concern as to whether it was too good to be true. Data and methods need to be made available as well as having controls and showing ROC curves to allow further evaluation. More rigor in defining terms and labeling figures is also needed. It was also felt that the figures, while aesthetically pleasing, were not helpful for evaluation of the algorithm."

What are the pressure points? For example, what if the data set has structure, but there really aren't distinct classes (as has been proposed for cortex)? Is it particularly sensitive to some of the choices of priors? Etc. Perhaps other examples would provide better insight into potential failure modes."

Then assign each unknown cell a label based on its co-membership with cells of known labels. This would end up giving a ranked score, since probabilistic. The comparison method would be something like nearest-neighbor assignment. To avoid making this a multi-class prediction problem, one could do it one class at a time and not worry about overlapped assignments. This would set a good standard for methods comparison."

This will lead to edge effects that may impact or bias connection patterns, for example cells whose cell bodies are near the center of the field of view should have more synaptic contacts (more partners in the contact matrix) simply because they are more fully captured in the reconstruction.

We have added simulations to get at these two issues. In short, as we had already shown with respect to (1), the algorithm works worse and worse as the classes are made more and more similar as this slows down mixing. Such behavior is typical for MCMC algorithms. With respect to (2), we constructed cases where the algorithm infers cell-types where they are none, in the case of continuous distributions and cases where the algorithm does not find the cell-types because other aspects of the cell types (e.g. boundaries of reconstructed areas) make estimation impossible."
