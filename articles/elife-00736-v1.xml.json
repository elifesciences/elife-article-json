Vann found that the third group was impaired in the memory tasks, consistent with the idea that outputs sent from the mammillary bodies to the thalamus are required for memory formation. Surprisingly, however, blocking signals sent from the hippocampal formation to the mammillary bodies had little impact on the formation of memories, whereas blocking inputs from Gudden's ventral tegmental nucleus led to significant impairments in memory."

Consequently, the mammillary bodies are principally seen as a relay of hippocampal projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei and, from there, to the cingulate (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barbizet, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Delay and Brion, 1969</a>) and prefrontal (<a href=\"#bib74\">Warrington and Weiskrantz, 1982</a>) cortices. The notion that the mammillary bodies form part of such an \u2018extended hippocampal system\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aggleton and Brown, 1999</a>) is seemingly supported by the unidirectional nature of the hippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aggleton et al., 2005</a>), along with clinical evidence of the importance for memory of the mammillary body projections to the thalamus, via the mammillothalamic tract (MTT; <a href=\"#bib11\">Carlesimo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Van der Werf et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Vann and Aggleton, 2003</a>). However, these standard models suffer two major shortcomings. First, they provide no real function for the mammillary bodies and second, they ignore other mammillary body afferents. The mammillary bodies receive dense inputs from Gudden's tegmental nuclei (e.g., <a href=\"#bib56\">Takeuchi et al., 1985</a>), making it possible that these midbrain inputs are functionally important for memory (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vann, 2010</a>)."

Rats with lesions blocking either of the two main mammillary body afferents (hippocampus formation or ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden) were tested alongside rats with lesions of the main mammillary body efferent pathway, the mammillothalamic tract. Only by comparing these separate lesions within the same study is it possible to measure their relative contributions. In one group the descending postcommissural fornix (PCF) was lesioned, a procedure that disconnects the hippocampal formation projections to the mammillary bodies whilst leaving other hippocampal connections intact, including those with the septum, striatum and anterior thalamic nuclei (<a href=\"#bib70\">Vann et al., 2011</a>). A second group received neurotoxic lesions of Gudden's ventral tegmental nucleus (VTNg). Although the lateral mammillary nucleus receives dense inputs from Gudden's dorsal tegmental nucleus, the VTNg was targeted because of its inputs to the medial mammillary nucleus. Previous clinical and behavioral evidence highlights the particular importance of the medial mammillary nucleus for memory (<a href=\"#bib61\">Vann, 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Vann and Albasser, 2009</a>). A third group received mammillothalamic tract lesions while a fourth group underwent control surgery. Rats were tested on three behavioral tasks, the first two of which are sensitive to hippocampal damage: T-maze alternation, a working memory task in the radial-arm maze, and a geometric discrimination task (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aggleton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vann, 2011</a>)."

There did not appear to be any loss of raphe neurons at any level other than that of the VTNg. At just this level there was a restricted loss of cells in the most dorsal part of the median raphe nuclei, that is, limited to just that part directly adjacent to the VTNg. There was no evidence that the lesions extended into either Gudden's dorsal tegmental nuclei or the laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, both of which stained intensely for acetylcholinesterase."

It has been repeatedly shown that fornix section leads to shrinkage of the mammillary bodies (due to loss of white matter). Mammillary body area measurements were, therefore, made to determine the impact of the PCFx lesions. The mean mammillary body area (\u00b1SEM) for the PCFx group was 1.34 mm<sup>2</sup> \u00b1 0.031, making them significantly smaller than the Sham group measurements of 1.79 mm<sup>2</sup> \u00b1 0.058 (<i>t</i>(13) = 6.44; p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>). Furthermore, the reduced mammillary body volumes of the present PCFx lesion cohort did not differ from a previous cohort where retrograde tracers had been used to confirm the postcommissural fornix disconnection (<i>t</i>(14)=1.67; p&gt;0.1) or from rats with complete fornix lesions (<i>t</i> &lt; 1) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Vann et al., 2011</a>). These findings demonstrate quantitative changes in mammillary body status, consistent with a complete tract section. The mammillary bodies were also assessed in the MTTx and VTNx lesion groups (MTTx = 1.38 mm<sup>2</sup> \u00b1 0.045; VTNx = 1.50 mm<sup>2</sup> \u00b1 0.026). When considering the mammillary body cross-sectional area of all four groups in the study there was a main effect of group (<i>F</i><sub>(3,27)</sub> = 22.3, p<i>&lt;</i>0.001). Post-hoc comparisons revealed the mammillary bodies to be larger in the Sham group than all lesion groups (all p&lt;0.001) while none of the lesion groups differed significantly from each other (all p&gt;0.05). To determine whether the reduced medial mammillary bodies volumes represented loss of white matter, as has been previously described (<a href=\"#bib38\">Loftus et al., 2000</a>), cell counts were made (cell counts per mm<sup>2</sup> \u00b1 SEM: Sham = 3530.4 \u00b1 77.6; PCFx = 4054.7 \u00b1 96.6; MTTx = 3405.4 \u00b1 89.8; VTNx = 3361.1 \u00b1 134,3). There was an overall group effect (<i>F</i><sub>(3,27)</sub> = 9.96, p<i>&lt;</i>0.001) which reflected a significant increase in the cell packing in the PCFx lesion group compared to all three other groups (Sham, p&lt;0.01; MTTx, p&lt;0.005; VTNx, p&lt;0.001) there was no difference in cell packing in any of the other groups (all comparisons, p&gt;0.5). This is consistent with the reduced mammillary body volume in the PCFx group reflecting loss of white matter and not an overall change in neuronal numbers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,J</a>). In contrast, lack of difference in cell packing in the MTTx and VTNx groups, combined with reduced cross-sectional area, would be consistent with some medial mammillary body cell loss in these groups. It is important to note that these counts are not stereological so cannot be used to determine total cell counts for the mammillary bodies."

The dentate gyrus (Sham = 31.0 \u00b1 2.93; MTTx = 24.6 \u00b1 4.91; VTNx = 21.0 \u00b1 3.01; PCFx = 29.0 \u00b1 4.30), CA3 (Sham = 23.6 \u00b1 3.21; MTTx = 15.0 \u00b1 2.72; VTNx = 18.1 \u00b1 3.31; PCFx = 24.1 \u00b1 2.82), and CA1 (Sham = 178.3 \u00b1 14.0; MTTx = 110.7 \u00b1 10.3; VTNx = 106.8 \u00b1 14.8; PCFx = 144.2 \u00b1 6.26), were also analyzed separately. These analyses revealed that the lesion-induced changes in hippocampual c-<i>fos</i> expression appeared to be largely driven by reductions in CA1 as this was the only subfield where there was a significant group difference (dentate gyrus: <i>F</i> &lt; 1; CA3: <i>F</i><sub>(3,26)</sub> =2.01, p&gt;0.4; CA1: <i>F</i><sub>(3,26)</sub> =8.07, p&lt;0.005). The group difference in CA1 arose due to fewer Fos-positive cell counts in both the MTTx and VTNx groups compared to the Sham group (both p&lt;0.005). None of the other group comparisons were significant (all p&gt;0.1)."

Models of MB function have inevitably focused on their dense hippocampal inputs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aggleton and Brown, 1999</a>) so that the MBs are principally thought to relay hippocampal information to the anterior thalamic nuclei (via the mammillothalamic tract), and then beyond (e.g., <a href=\"#bib8\">Barbizet, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Delay and Brion, 1969</a>). However, the MBs have heavy, reciprocal connections with Gudden's tegmental nuclei whose functional significance has been largely overlooked. The present study contrasted the relative contributions of these two, principal MB inputs for (i) spatial memory and (ii) control of the expression of the immediate early gene c-<i>fos</i> in distal limbic sites. The second goal arose because mammillothalamic tract lesions cause c-Fos hypoactivity in numerous sites including the hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and prelimbic cortex (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vann and Albasser, 2009</a>). The present study determined whether it is the loss of hippocampal or tegmental inputs that is the main cause of this neural hypoactivity. For these joint reasons, rats with either lesions of the descending postcommissural fornix (PCFx), which carries the hippocampal formation projections, or lesions of Gudden's ventral tegmental nucleus (VTNx) were tested alongside mammillothalamic tract lesion rats (MTTx), that is, the major efferent tract by which the MBs have their principal effects (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vann and Aggleton, 2003</a>)."

At no stage did these two lesion groups significantly differ from one another. The only comparison where just one of these two groups was impaired was for Stage 1 of T-maze alternation where the VTNx, but not MTTx, group made significantly more errors than the Sham group. This apparent exception makes sense when the results from Stage 2 are considered. In Stage 1 of the T-maze alternation task both the sample and test runs were in the same maze; in Stage 2 the sample and test runs were in adjacent mazes to prevent the use of intra-maze cues. The performances of the VTNx and MTTx groups in Stage 2 were equivalent, with both groups impaired relative to the Sham group, suggesting the MTTx group had been using intra-maze cues to solve Stage 1, so masking their spatial memory impairments. The MTTx and VTNx groups were also equivalently impaired on the radial-arm maze task. Although all groups showed an improvement across training, it appears that in the VTNx and MTTx groups this reflected a greater reliance on the use of intra-maze cues given the disruptive effect of rotating the maze midway through the trial. Thus both behavioral tasks indicated that the MTTx and VTNx rats were less able to use allocentric cues and more reliant on intra-maze cues. In contrast, the PCFx animals were not impaired relative to the Shams on any of the behavioral tasks. Consequently, the PCFx animals performed significantly better than both the VTNx and MTTx groups on both the radial-arm maze and T-maze tasks despite producing MB shrinkage (resulting from loss of fiber inputs) equivalent to that found after complete fornix lesions. The present PCFx lesions were indistinguishable from those that had previously been demonstrated to completely disconnect the hippocampal formation-MB projections (<a href=\"#bib70\">Vann et al., 2011</a>)."

Reduced levels of c-Fos have also been found in this same network of brain regions following anterior thalamic nuclei lesions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jenkins et al., 2002</a>). However, unlike the c-Fos reduction following anterior thalamic lesions, the current changes reflect \u2018indirect\u2019 effects, as the MTT and VTNg lesions do not result in direct de-afferentation of any of these sites. Although reduced activity in this memory-related network seems to be a consistent marker of damage to the medial diencephalon, in animal models and humans (<a href=\"#bib32\">Joyce et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kapur, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Reed et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Savage et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Caulo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Anzalone et al., 2010</a>), it is not known whether this reduced activity contributes to mnemonic deficits or whether it simply a symptom of the system no longer working effectively.

The lack of effect of PCFx lesions is quite surprising and does raise the question of what does this pathway do. It is possible that the tasks used in the present study did not sufficiently tax this pathway and that greater task demands could result in lesion-induced impairments. In addition, it may be that these projections contribute to memory under normal conditions but the general lack of effects following PCFx lesions are due to redundancies in this pathway, given the direct projections from the hippocampal formation to the anterior thalamic nuclei. While complete fornix lesions disconnect the hippocampal formation from a number of sites, including their projections to both the MBs and anterior thalamic nuclei, selective lesions of the descending PCF will spare all but the MB projections. The hippocampal projections to the MBs and anterior thalamic nuclei arise from different cell populations (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wright et al., 2010</a>) so it is not clear whether the same information is being conveyed (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tsanov et al., 2011</a>) and, therefore, how much replication there is in the system. Those examples where fornix lesions appear more disruptive than MB lesions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aggleton et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gaffan et al., 2001</a>) are consistent with the idea that the direct hippocampal-thalamic inputs are supportive, but there are some situations where anterior thalamic or MB lesion effects can be greater than those of fornix lesions (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tonkiss and Rawlins, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Vann et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jenkins et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aggleton et al., 2009</a>), so highlighting the potential functional importance of additional information streams, for example, from the limbic midbrain."

Questions immediately arise about the information provided by these tegmental nuclei and how might this relate to spatial memory. VTNg cells fire rhythmically and coherently with hippocampal theta (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kocsis et al., 2001</a>), and theta-related cells in the medial mammillary nucleus have been linked to memory function (<a href=\"#bib77\">Alonso and Llinas, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Kocsis and Vertes, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Bland et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Kirk et al., 1996</a>). It is also the case that the VTNg have been linked to vigilance states (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bassant and Poindessous-Jazat, 2001</a>), and so might additionally modulate hippocampal activity. The presumption, based on their dense interconnectivity, is that the VTNg lesion effects are primarily via the MBs. The VTNg does, however, innervate a number of other sites, including the lateral hypothalamus, preoptic area, medial septum, parts of the reticular pontine nucleus, median raphe nuclei, supramammillary nucleus and ventral tegmental area (<a href=\"#bib44\">Petrovicky, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Leichnetz et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hayakawa et al., 1993</a>). These other VTNg efferents appear light (see <a href=\"#bib25\">Hayakawa and Zyo, 1984</a>), and in some instances not been confirmed (<a href=\"#bib9\">Barone et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Vertes, 1988</a>), a contribution from their disconnection must be considered, particularly because some of these other sites have hippocampal connections. However, lesions of these alternative sites rarely result in the pattern of spatial memory impairments seen following VTNg lesions (e.g., <a href=\"#bib49\">Sarihi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pan and McNaughton, 2002</a>). In addition, the lack of Fos changes in the supramammillary and septal nuclei following VTNg lesions provides some evidence that they are not having their effects via these routes, while the striking similarity of the VTNg and MTT lesion effects in the present study provides further support for the VTNg-MB pathway."

For this training there was no landmark and two platforms were present, one in each of the correct corners (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The rectangular insert was rotated between trials so the platform positions did not remain fixed relative to external cues. The correct corners were balanced across groups.

The same maze and room were used as for Experiment 2 but the task differed; the experimenter controlled which arm the animals visited by using a pulley system to open the guillotine door at the start of the arm, that is, the animals were only allowed access to one arm at any one time. When all eight arms had been visited (i.e., the trial had been completed) the rat was placed in an aluminum traveling box for approximately 2 min while all arms were re-baited with sucrose pellets. Each session consisted of multiple trials in the radial-arm maze, one after the other, and lasted 20 min. Different randomized arm sequences were used on successive trials. On the final test day the animals performed the same task, in an identical radial-arm maze, but in a novel room (255 cm \u00d7 330 cm \u00d7 260 cm); the two radial-arm maze rooms were markedly different (i.e., size, shape, lighting) and contained distinct, salient visual cues such as geometric shapes and high-contrast stimuli on the walls. Animals were placed in a holding box in a quiet, dark room for 30 min before and 90 min after each radial-arm maze session. This time window was chosen as peak levels of the Fos protein are found approximately 90 min after activation (e.g., <a href=\"#bib54\">Sharp et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chaudhuri et al., 2000</a>)."

To assess the integrity of the cholinergic efferents from the laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, intensity measures were taken (following acetyl cholinergic staining) from the anteroventral thalamic nuclei and interpeduncular nucleus. Intensity measures were taken across four sections for the anteroventral and interpeduncular nuclei sections (i.e., eight total measures for the anteroventral thalamic nuclei for both hemispheres). Intensity measures were also taken from white matter adjacent to the nuclei of interest for each section: the stria medullaris of the thalamus for the anteroventral nucleus and the cerebral peduncle for the interpeduncular nucleus. The white matter value was then subtracted from the nucleus value, for each section separately, and the mean values calculated."

The hippocampus counts were taken at the level of 4.5 mm behind bregma (<a href=\"#bib42\">Paxinos and Watson, 1997</a>); the counts included the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1, that is, not the subiculum complex. The retrosplenial cortex counts were taken at a level approximated 6 mm behind bregma and involved retrosplenial granular a and b (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wyss and Van Groen, 1992</a>). Two frontal cortical regions were also examined: prelimbic cortex (PL) and infralimbic cortex (IL) taken at a level of 2.7 mm in front of bregma. The supramammillary nuclei (\u22124.3 mm from bregma), medial and lateral septum (+0.7 mm from bregma) were assessed as these regions have been reported to receive inputs from VTN. Finally, counts were taken from the primary somatosensory area (\u22122.5 mm from bregma) as any difference in this region might reflect abnormal sensorimotor patterns following surgery or non-specific lesion effects."

This rotation causes the local cues of the maze to be dissociated from the extramaze cues available in the room. For the sham and PCFx lesioned animals, this rotation has no effect. This suggests, as one would expect, that extramaze cues are used in identifying which arms have been visited and which have not."
