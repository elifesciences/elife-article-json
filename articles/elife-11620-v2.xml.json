Understanding of the transformation of the inert resting state of the active site FeMo-cofactor into an activated state capable of reducing dinitrogen remains elusive. Here we report the catalysis dependent, site-selective incorporation of selenium into the FeMo-cofactor from selenocyanate as a newly identified substrate and inhibitor. The 1.60 \u00c5 resolution structure reveals selenium occupying the S2B site of FeMo-cofactor in the <i>Azotobacter vinelandii</i> MoFe-protein, a position that was recently identified as the CO-binding site. The Se2B-labeled enzyme retains substrate reduction activity and marks the starting point for a crystallographic pulse-chase experiment of the active site during turnover. Through a series of crystal structures obtained at resolutions of 1.32\u20131.66 \u00c5, including the CO-inhibited form of Av1-Se2B, the exchangeability of all three belt-sulfur sites is demonstrated, providing direct insights into unforeseen rearrangements of the metal center during catalysis."

Understanding of the transformation of the inert resting state of the active site FeMo-cofactor into an activated state capable of reducing dinitrogen remains elusive. Here we report the catalysis dependent, site-selective incorporation of selenium into the FeMo-cofactor from selenocyanate as a newly identified substrate and inhibitor. The 1.60 \u00c5 resolution structure reveals selenium occupying the S2B site of FeMo-cofactor in the <i>Azotobacter vinelandii</i> MoFe-protein, a position that was recently identified as the CO-binding site. The Se2B-labeled enzyme retains substrate reduction activity and marks the starting point for a crystallographic pulse-chase experiment of the active site during turnover. Through a series of crystal structures obtained at resolutions of 1.32\u20131.66 \u00c5, including the CO-inhibited form of Av1-Se2B, the exchangeability of all three belt-sulfur sites is demonstrated, providing direct insights into unforeseen rearrangements of the metal center during catalysis."

The most abundant form of nitrogen is dinitrogen, which comprises 78% of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. However, dinitrogen is highly unreactive, and so the nitrogen must be converted into a more reactive form before it can be used biologically. The only known enzyme capable of carrying out this reaction is called nitrogenase, but how this enzyme performs this difficult task is still not understood."

Spatzal, Perez et al. examined the structure of the active site of nitrogenase taken from the bacteria species <i>Azotobacter vinelandii</i> while the enzyme transformed selenocyanate. This revealed unexpected structural changes of the FeMo-cofactor that significantly challenge previous assumptions about how the active site works. For example, a single selenium atom from selenocyanate can be incorporated into a specific position of the FeMo-cofactor, which highlights the importance of this position for the enzyme\u2019s initial interaction with substrates."

This revealed that selenium can migrate into the positions taken up by three of the FeMo-cofactor\u2019s nine sulfur atoms (the three \u201cbelt-sulfurs\u201d) during these interactions. The active site was not previously thought to be active in this way: this will need to be taken into account in all future models that describe how dinitrogen is converted into a biologically useful form."

The MoFe-protein, an (\u03b1\u03b2)<sub>2</sub> tetramer, contains two types of unique metal centers per catalytic \u03b1\u03b2-unit: the P-cluster [8Fe:7S] and the FeMo-cofactor [7Fe:9S:C:Mo]-<i>R</i>-homocitrate (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kim and Rees, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Einsle et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Spatzal et al., 2011</a>).

Consequently all belt-S atoms of FeMo-cofactor, separated by 5.7\u2009\u00c5 in the resting state, can interchange during substrate (acetylene) reduction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). The Se migration from S2B favors S5A over S3A at the earliest time points (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>), but whether this reflects an ordered sequence or a more complex mechanism cannot be established from these data. Remarkably, with a sufficient number of catalytic turnovers (several thousand, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), the total Se is lost and apparently replaced by S, leading to a recovery of the original FeMo-cofactor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Neither the source of this S, nor the pathway(s) by which Se exits the MoFe-protein, have been identified. The observation that Se2B can migrate to S5A and S3A and is ultimately chased from the cofactor, clearly implies that all three belt-positions are labilized during the reduction of acetylene. In contrast, little or no migration of Se2B was observed during proton reduction."

The CO inhibition of Av1-Se2B during catalytic turnover has the potential to evaluate both the reactivity at the Se2B site and the location of the displaced chalcogen. The Av1-Se-CO structure at a resolution of 1.53\u2009\u00c5 revealed that Se2B was ca. 90% replaced by a bridging CO with a geometry nearly identical to that observed for Av1-CO (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Spatzal et al., 2014</a>). Unexpectedly, Se was not expelled from the FeMo-cofactor but migrated to the other two belt positions with ca. 88% overall retention (Se occupancy: 10% (x2B; where x reflects a mixture of S and Se), 35% (x3A) and 44% (x5A)). This result augments our findings from acetylene turnover, namely that the catalytic state of the cofactor capable of interacting with CO is similar to that which reacts with substrates. In contrast to the simple model of CO displacement and loss of S from S2B previously envisioned (<a href=\"#bib23\">Spatzal et al., 2014</a>), the path of net loss of sulfur from the cofactor is through either one or both of the other belt positions."

The interchange of all belt-S atoms is suggestive that substrates may also migrate to different sites of the trigonal six-iron prism during catalysis. While the underlying mechanism(s) are not known, one can speculate this may involve a twist-type mechanism interconverting trigonal prism and octahedral forms of the six-iron core, where swapping Fe-S bonding partners in the latter would result in interchange of the belt-S."

Quantification of Se/Fe/S anomalous electron densities at 12,662 eV (f\u2019\u2019 (Se) = 3.84 e; f\u2019\u2019 (Fe) = 1.50 e; f\u2019\u2019 (S) = 0.24 e) based on the refined structural models was performed using a MAPMAN-dependent script, allowing a free choice of radius of integration and B-factor cut-off, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib7\">Einsle et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Spatzal et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">2014</a>). The quantification of Se-occupancies was carried out by determining relative anomalous densities arising from Se within an integration sphere radius of 1.0\u2009\u00c5 at the respective position based on the anomalous difference Fourier maps. This strategy was shown to be the most robust approach for density quantification within the FeMo-cofactor (<a href=\"#bib22\">Spatzal et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Spatzal, 2015</a>). Comparison of the integrated Se-density values to the average anomalous density values for a full occupancy iron atom, taking into account the differences in f\u201d for Fe and Se at 12,662 eV, yielded Se occupancy values. A total of 30 iron atoms (2x7 Fe from the two copies of FeMo-cofactor, and 2x8 Fe from the two copies of P-cluster per Av1 heterotetramer) were used for averaging and yielded the internal reference for anomalous scattering at 12,662 eV. The standard deviation between anomalous density values for the Fe-atoms was \u2264 4%. No adjustments were made for variation in B factors since the Fe and S components of both metalloclusters have similar values (average and standard deviation = 9.3 \u00b1 1 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> for isotropically refined B-factors in the Av1-Se2B structure). For Fe and S in the FeMo-cofactor, the corresponding B values are 9.0 \u00b1 0.4 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, with the B for Se2B = 9.9 \u00b1 0.5 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> and the average B for the entire protein structure = 13.8 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>. Quantification of Se-occupancies was further improved by including the contribution of the residual anomalous density of sulfur, with the anomalous scattering of S being 6.3% that of Se (f\u2019\u2019(S)/f\u2019\u2019(Se)) at an energy of 12,662 eV. The largest deviation between Se-anomalous densities observed for the two crystallographically independent copies of FeMo-cofactor was found to be ~5%, which provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the occupancy values. The root mean square value of the anomalous electron density map is ~2% of the Se peak value, which sets a lower threshold on the minimum occupancy that can be detected at this site."

This study shows that the MoFe cluster is far less rigid than generally anticipated. The authors solved a series of structures of the nitrogenase MoFe protein at high resolution and use a creative application of anomalous scattering to demonstrate the migration of sulfur ligands among three sites that bridge the Fe and Mo-Fe ends of the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-cofactor). The structures show that multiple sulfur positions on the MoFe cluster can exchange with selenium in a turn-over dependent manner, with the Se first entering into the S2B site, the same position that CO was previously shown to occupy. The high resolution data show that Se can rotate around the cluster, occupying different S belt positions, before it is finally displaced by S after multiple turnovers with acetylene. Other substrates do not cause Se migration. For a long time, scientists have investigated the potential positions on the MoFe cluster that represent the binding site(s) for substrates, and this work suggests that the 'resting state' of the cluster, with its sulfur belt intact, may not be the form of the cluster to which substrates bind. As such, this study should cause the re-examination of all mechanistic proposals for nitrogenase, and complex metalloclusters in general."

Substrate binding (excluding protons) appears to be accompanied by rearrangements of the FeMo-cofactor (these may be reflected in the essentially stoichiometric migration of Se2B to the x3A and x5A belt positions upon a single CO-binding event in the Av1-Se-CO structure). It is important to emphasize that during turnover, we have no evidence that the S2B ligand completely dissociates from the cofactor (as it is in the CO-inhibited structure), but speculate it most likely remains bonded to at least one Fe. At the completion of a catalytic cycle, the FeMo-cofactor returns to the original arrangement with a high probability; however, with a small, but non-zero probability, this hypothetical intermediate can rearrange effectively resulting in net migration of the belt ligands. We have tried to develop kinetic models for the migration based on the data <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, but these are not sufficiently accurate to be useful in a quantitatively predictive fashion."
