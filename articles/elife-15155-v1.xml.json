                    "text": "Eukaryotic mismatch repair (MMR) utilizes single-strand breaks as signals to target the strand to be repaired. DNA-bound PCNA is also presumed to direct MMR. The MMR capability must be limited to a post-replicative temporal window during which the signals are available. However, both identity of the signal(s) involved in the retention of this temporal window and the mechanism that maintains the MMR capability after DNA synthesis remain unclear. Using <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts, we discovered a mechanism that ensures long-term retention of the MMR capability. We show that DNA-bound PCNA induces strand-specific MMR in the absence of strand discontinuities. Strikingly, MutS\u03b1 inhibited PCNA unloading through its PCNA-interacting motif, thereby extending significantly the temporal window permissive to strand-specific MMR. Our data identify DNA-bound PCNA as the signal that enables strand discrimination after the disappearance of strand discontinuities, and uncover a novel role of MutS\u03b1 in the retention of the post-replicative MMR capability."

The MMR capability must be limited to a post-replicative temporal window during which the signals are available. However, both identity of the signal(s) involved in the retention of this temporal window and the mechanism that maintains the MMR capability after DNA synthesis remain unclear. Using <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts, we discovered a mechanism that ensures long-term retention of the MMR capability. We show that DNA-bound PCNA induces strand-specific MMR in the absence of strand discontinuities. Strikingly, MutS\u03b1 inhibited PCNA unloading through its PCNA-interacting motif, thereby extending significantly the temporal window permissive to strand-specific MMR. Our data identify DNA-bound PCNA as the signal that enables strand discrimination after the disappearance of strand discontinuities, and uncover a novel role of MutS\u03b1 in the retention of the post-replicative MMR capability."

Since erroneously inserted nucleotides are present on newly synthesized DNA strands, identification of the newly synthesized strand is a critical step in MMR. By rectifying replication errors, MMR increases the replication fidelity by ~2 orders of magnitude in yeast (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lujan et al., 2014</a>). In humans, genetic or epigenetic inactivation of MMR genes elevates the risk of tumorigenesis in both hereditary and sporadic manners (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jiricny, 2013</a>)."

Mismatches are recognized by the mismatch sensor MutS homodimer. MutS and the MutL homodimer then activate the latent nicking-endonuclease MutH, which cleaves the unmethylated strand at the hemi-methylated GATC sequences. MMR is possible from the time of hemi-methylated GATC generation by DNA synthesis until full methylation of the GATC sites. Maintaining this temporal window is critical for efficient MMR, because over-expression of the Dam methylase, by which full-methylation of the GATC sites is accelerated, significantly elevates the mutation frequency (<a href=\"#bib20\">Herman and Modrich, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Marinus et al., 1984</a>).

Two MutS heterodimers, MutS\u03b1 (Msh2-Msh6) and MutS\u03b2 (Msh2-Msh3) recognize replication errors; MutS\u03b1 has a biased preference for base-base mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops (IDLs), while MutS\u03b2 preferentially recognizes large IDLs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Iyer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jiricny, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kunkel and Erie, 2015</a>). After mismatch binding, MutS\u03b1/\u03b2 are converted into closed \u2018clamp-like\u2019 forms, by which they can translocate along DNA. They then recruit the latent nicking-endonuclease MutL\u03b1 (Mlh1-Pms2 in vertebrates and Mlh1-Pms1 in yeast) to initiate the removal of the error-carrying DNA strand. Two other eukaryotic MutL homologs, MutL\u03b2 (Mlh1-Pms1 in vertebrates and Mlh1-Mlh2 in yeast) and MutL\u03b3 (Mlh1-Mlh3) are suggested to play minor roles in somatic MMR (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jiricny, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Campbell et al., 2014</a>). Successful reconstitutions of eukaryotic MMR have shown that MutS\u03b1, or MutS\u03b2, and MutL\u03b1, the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) sliding clamp, the clamp loader Replication Factor C (RFC), the Exo1 exonuclease, and the DNA synthesis components promote MMR when a strand discontinuity is present (<a href=\"#bib14\">Genschel and Modrich, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dzantiev et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Constantin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>). A strand discontinuity, which can occur on either 5\u2019- or 3\u2019-side of the mismatch, activates MutL\u03b1 through a MutS\u03b1- and PCNA-dependent mechanism to induce successive rounds of nicking on the error-carrying strand (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kadyrov et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Pluciennik et al., 2010</a>). Single-strand DNA termini such as 5\u2019-ends of the Okazaki fragments serve as entry points for Exo1 and strand discrimination signals in vivo\u00a0as well (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pavlov et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Nick McElhinny et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Liberti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Lujan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). Recent studies have revealed that ribonucleotides embedded by replicative DNA polymerases serve as strand signals for MMR in vitro and contribute to a sub-fraction of leading strand MMR in vivo, after converted into single-strand gaps through RNaseH2-dependent ribonucleotide excision repair (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ghodgaonkar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lujan et al., 2013</a>)."

PCNA is a ring-shaped homo-trimer that supports various DNA transactions including DNA replication and repair (<a href=\"#bib15\">Georgescu et al., 2015</a>). PCNA is loaded onto DNA from the template-primer junction by RFC, and likely unloaded by an RFC-like complex containing Elg1 after the completion of DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kubota et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">2015</a>). Since its DNA binding is asymmetric with respect to polarities of the parental and daughter strands, DNA-bound PCNA can hold information for the newly synthesized strand (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bowman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Georgescu et al., 2015</a>). PCNA plays an essential role in an early MMR step that precedes degradation of the error-carrying strand (<a href=\"#bib70\">Umar et al., 1996</a>). PCNA loaded from a strand discontinuity induces strand-specific, mismatch- and MutS\u03b1-dependent activation of the\u00a0MutL\u03b1 endonuclease (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kadyrov et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Pluciennik et al., 2010</a>). When PCNA is loaded onto closed circular DNA without defined orientation, it induces unbiased nicking on both DNA strands (<a href=\"#bib61\">Pluciennik et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">2013</a>). These findings have led to a proposal that orientation of DNA-bound PCNA is a critical determinant for the nicking specificity of MutL\u03b1."

Numbers of PCNA mutants in yeast exhibit mutator phenotypes that are epistatic to MMR mutations (<a href=\"#bib29\">Johnson et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Umar et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lau et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Goellner et al., 2014</a>). It interacts with MutS\u03b1/\u03b2 through their PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) motifs, which reside at the N-termini of Msh6 and Msh3 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Flores-Rozas et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kleczkowska et al., 2001</a>). In both cases, the PIP motifs and the mispair binding domains are connected through long linkers, which are predicted to be disordered in yeast (<a href=\"#bib66\">Shell et al., 2007</a>). Mutants of the PIP motifs in Msh6 and Msh3 show substantial but not complete reduction of the MMR activity, indicating that the PIP motif plays an important, yet assistive, non-essential role in MMR (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Flores-Rozas et al., 2000</a>). The PIP motif has been proposed to tether MutS\u03b1 to the replication fork to assist its mismatch recognition (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kleczkowska et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hombauer et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Haye and Gammie, 2015</a>). A recent study has shown that this motif in MutS\u03b1 is important for a late MMR step(s) involving degradation of the error-carrying strand, especially by the Exo1-independent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib17\">Goellner et al., 2014</a>). These findings suggest that PCNA coordinates multiple reactions in MMR, yet the exact role of PCNA in MMR is still not clearly defined."

It has been shown in yeast that MutS\u03b1 must be present during S-phase to suppress mutations (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hombauer et al., 2011b</a>). Therefore, the generation and retention of the strand signals for MMR should be intimately coupled with DNA replication. Since PCNA transiently remains on DNA after the completion of DNA synthesis, DNA-bound PCNA could mediate the coupling of MMR with DNA replication. However, because experimental evidence that DNA-bound PCNA induces strand-specific MMR in the absence of strand discontinuities is currently lacking, it is still uncertain whether PCNA by itself can mediate the coupling of MMR with DNA replication. In addition, how functional interaction between the MMR system and DNA-bound PCNA, which should be unloaded from DNA shortly after the completion of DNA synthesis, is ensured remains highly unclear."

We further show that DNA-bound PCNA induces strand-specific MMR in the absence of strand discontinuities. Strikingly, we found that MutS\u03b1 attenuates unloading of PCNA and retains the MMR capability largely through its PIP motif. Our data thus identify PCNA as the eukaryotic strand discrimination molecule that retains the MMR capability after DNA synthesis, and delineate a critical role of MutS\u03b1 in maintenance of the temporal window for eukaryotic MMR."

We exploited its extremely high capacity for DNA synthesis to study MMR. A plasmid carrying an A:C mismatch, which is a preferred MMR substrate in crude <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts (<a href=\"#bib71\">Varlet et al., 1990</a>), and a 15-nucleotide (nt) single-strand gap was constructed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This plasmid was synthesized in vitro by second strand DNA synthesis after annealing of a primer carrying a 'C'-mismatch on single-stranded phagemid DNA corresponding to the 'A'-strand. Since NPE contains a high concentration of Geminin, a specific inhibitor for assembly of pre-replicative complexes, no DNA replication initiates when DNA is incubated directly in NPE, while DNA synthesis from existing 3\u2019-termini is active (<a href=\"#bib75\">Walter et al., 1998</a>). NPE corrected the A:C mismatch by selectively editing the base on the gap-carrying strand (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013E</a>, see 'mock'), more efficiently than conventional crude <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As seen previously (<a href=\"#bib56\">Olivera Harris et al., 2015</a>), a gap could be placed on either 5\u2019 or 3\u2019 of the mismatch, and repair DNA synthesis occurred preferentially within a fragment containing the shorter path between the gap and the mismatch (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that NPE supports bidirectional MMR. Depletion of the Msh2-containing (MutS\u03b1/\u03b2) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) or Mlh1-containing complexes (MutL\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) abolished the repair reaction. Unlike other systems, a nick did not efficiently induce MMR (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These results demonstrate that NPE efficiently recapitulates gap-directed, bi-directional MMR that is dependent on both MutS\u03b1/\u03b2 and MutL\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3. Some background repair observed in the absence of a gap could be due to either spontaneous base damages, which elicit base excision repair that in turn direct MMR (<a href=\"#bib64\">Repmann et al., 2015</a>), or strand breaks that have occurred during handling of the substrate."

To understand the temporal relationship between gap filling and gap-directed MMR, we compared the kinetics of DNA synthesis at the gap site and repair of the mismatch simultaneously on the same substrate. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, DNA synthesis at the gap site (estimated by digestion with <i>Pac</i>I placed within the gap) was mostly completed within 30 s. However, this DNA synthesis did not covalently close the mismatch-carrying plasmid, suggesting that new strand breaks are introduced on the DNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The A to G MMR gradually progressed until ~30\u2009min, and shortly after the mismatch correction, closed circular molecules were accumulated. These observations suggest that, in this gap-directed MMR model, efficient DNA synthesis at the gap site precedes mismatch correction involving degradation of the error-carrying strand. As suggested previously (<a href=\"#bib72\">Varlet et al., 1996</a>), the 3\u2019-terminus is likely used as a signal for MMR, rather than the initiation point of extensive strand removal."

To answer this question, we set up a stepwise incubation assay that separates gap filling and mismatch recognition. We first incubated the MMR substrates in a MutS\u03b1/\u03b2-depleted (MutS-depleted) NPE, in which the gap should be filled and ligated without mismatch recognition, and then supplied MutS\u03b1/\u03b2 by addition of fresh NPE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In the MutS-depleted NPE, more than 80% of gap-carrying plasmids were converted into the closed-circular form within 1.5\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, lane 9). However, ~40% of A to G MMR was still observed upon addition of fresh NPE at 2\u2009min, at a time when at most, only ~14% strand discontinuities remained (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, lane 10 and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, lane 14). From 0.5 to 2\u2009min, the MMR efficiency consistently exceeded the amounts of remaining strand discontinuities. These data suggest that the strand information derived from a gap is 'memorized' on DNA to induce subsequent MMR."

Therefore, at least one PCNA trimer must be involved in every gap filling, and it could retain the strand information after gap filling. If PCNA stores strand information for MMR, PCNA loaded on DNA in a specific orientation should direct MMR in NPE even in the absence of strand discontinuities. To test this idea, we established an in vitro PCNA-loading reaction using purified human RFC (hRFC) and PCNA (hPCNA), which can substitute for <i>Xenopus</i> PCNA (xPCNA) in the MMR reaction (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A mismatch plasmid carrying an A-strand nick was bound to Sepharose beads through a site-specific biotin modification (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). hPCNA was loaded onto the immobilized plasmids in a nick-dependent, and therefore orientation-specific manner. The nick left on the DNA was sealed with the T4 DNA ligase. The hPCNA-DNA complex was then washed with 1\u2009M KCl to remove hRFC, T4 ligase, and loosely associated hPCNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

Consistent with this idea, a significant portion of nick ligation was independent of PCNA, explaining why a nick did not induce MMR as efficiently as a gap in NPE (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the absence of MutS\u03b1/\u03b2, the strand information was gradually lost after the disappearance of strand discontinuities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), suggesting that PCNA is unloaded from DNA within this time window. To examine PCNA dissociation in NPE, we loaded hPCNA on DNA, incubated it in NPE, and quantified the remaining hPCNA using an hPCNA specific monoclonal antibody that does not cross-react with xPCNA (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This method distinguishes retention of hPCNA from sticking of xPCNA. In the mock-treated NPE, hPCNA was quickly dissociated from a homoduplex DNA within a few minutes, while dissociation was attenuated in the NPE depleted of xRfc3, indicating that PCNA is removed from DNA mostly through an active unloading process requiring the Rfc3-containing complex(es) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Due to the\u00a0unavailability of appropriate\u00a0antibodies, the specific Rfc3-containing complex responsible for PCNA unloading could not be identified."

We therefore examined hPCNA retention and the MMR capability in the presence or absence of MutS\u03b1/\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In the MutS-depleted NPE, hPCNA was again quickly unloaded from mismatch-carrying DNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Concurrent with PCNA unloading, the PCNA-directed MMR capability rapidly dropped, leaving only ~10% of repairable molecules at 5\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, lane 5). In contrast, in the MutL-depleted NPE (containing endogenous MutS\u03b1/\u03b2 but deficient for MMR), even at 30\u2009min, more than one hPCNA trimer on an average still remained on DNA, and ~20% of mismatches were still repairable (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, lane 14). The difference in PCNA retention and the kinetics of repair was not due to remaining nicks on the DNA, because neither MutS- nor MutL-depletion significantly affected the level of nick-carrying molecules (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

In either MutS-depleted or MutS/MutL-depleted NPE, more than 40% of mismatches were still repairable upon addition of fresh NPE at 2\u2009min, confirming the ~2\u2009min strand memory seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C and D</a>). Strikingly, in the MutL-depleted NPE, &gt;60% of mismatches were repairable at 10\u2009min, and ~35% were still repairable even at 30\u2009min. Using one-phase exponential decay fitting, which could explain most data with reasonable quality (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i> &gt; 0.8), we estimated the half-life of the strand memory in the absence of MutS\u03b1/\u03b2 to be approximately 2\u2009min, and to be approximately 40\u2009min in the presence of MutS\u03b1/\u03b2 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

In good agreement with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kleczkowska et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Iyer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bowen et al., 2013</a>), when no stepwise incubation was involved, the gap-directed MMR on the 3.0 kb substrate was largely restored by xMutS\u03b1<sup>PIP</sup> in MutS-depleted NPE (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that in this experimental setup the PIP function is not important for MMR. Mismatch binding of xMutS\u03b1<sup>PIP</sup> was not significantly compromised (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, xMutS\u03b1<sup>PIP</sup> was almost inert for PCNA retention. We repeated the PCNA-unloading assay using MutS/MutL-depleted NPE supplemented with xMutS\u03b1<sup>WT</sup> or xMutS\u03b1<sup>PIP</sup> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Although xMutS\u03b1<sup>WT</sup> attenuated PCNA unloading, xMutS\u03b1<sup>PIP</sup> did not exhibit detectable retention of PCNA on mismatched DNA, compared to the buffer control (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). In the gap-derived strand memory assay, xMutS\u03b1<sup>WT</sup> restored\u00a0retention of strand memory in the MutS/MutL-depleted NPE without affecting the gap-filling reaction (<i>t<sub>1/2</sub></i> = 25.5\u2009min; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In contrast, only modest restoration of the retention of strand information was seen with xMutS\u03b1<sup>PIP</sup> (<i>t<sub>1/2</sub></i> = 12.5\u2009min). These results indicate that the PIP motif is required for inhibition of PCNA unloading and largely responsible for strand memory retention, yet a PIP-independent mechanism also contributes to the retention of strand information derived from a gap."

Since DNA replication generates identical copies of parental DNA, the strand discrimination reaction in MMR necessarily requires direct or indirect interplay with the replication complex (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wagner and Meselson, 1976</a>). Because of the asymmetric nature of its binding to DNA, its critical roles in an early step of MMR and in the activation of MutL\u03b1, PCNA is presumed to be the mediator of the interplay between the replication complex and MMR (<a href=\"#bib70\">Umar et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pavlov et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dzantiev et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kadyrov et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Pluciennik et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hombauer et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Pe\u00f1a-Diaz and Jiricny, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Georgescu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kunkel and Erie, 2015</a>). In this study, we provided experimental evidence that DNA-loaded PCNA indeed directs strand-specific MMR in the absence of strand discontinuities. We further discovered that MutS\u03b1 inhibits PCNA unloading using its PIP motif on the N-terminus of Msh6, and that this reaction significantly extends the temporal window during which MMR is possible. Our results thus uncovered a novel mechanism in which interplay between PCNA and MutS\u03b1 maintains the post-replicative temporal window for MMR."

As seen in other systems, we observed efficient bidirectional MMR in NPE (frequently &gt;80% efficient). Curiously, we noticed some difference between NPE and other systems. Both in reconstitution systems and in human cell extracts, 5\u2019-nick directed MMR can occur in the absence of MutL\u03b1, whereas 3\u2019-nick directed MMR depends on MutL\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Drummond et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Genschel and Modrich, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dzantiev et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Constantin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bowen et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, not only 3\u2019-gap directed but also 5\u2019-gap directed MMR was dependent on MutL complexes in NPE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013E</a>). Although this could possibly reflect difference in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 strand excision mechanism between species, we assume that the difference largely come from highly efficient DNA synthesis and ligation in NPE; quick sealing of a gap would necessitate MutL\u03b1-dependent incision for MMR even when a gap was placed on the 5\u2019-side of the mismatch. Interestingly, DNA synthesis at the 3\u2019-gap clearly precedes MMR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), indicating that strand degradation does not progressively occur from the 3\u2019-terminus of the gap. PCNA molecules loaded at the 3\u2019 terminus, perhaps more than one trimer, could be used by both MMR and DNA polymerases without significantly interfering with each other (see below). Consistently, a nick is suggested to function as a strand signal rather than an entry point for exonucleases in crude extracts of <i>Xenopus</i> eggs (<a href=\"#bib72\">Varlet et al., 1996</a>)."

Three lines of evidence indicate that the molecule responsible for memorizing strand information is PCNA. First, directional loading of PCNA efficiently bypassed the need for strand discontinuities in strand-specific MMR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). Second, the amount of DNA-bound PCNA correlated with the MMR capability (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Third, MutS\u03b1 maintained the MMR capability derived from a gap largely through the PIP motif (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). The fact that PCNA was essential for the gap-filling reaction in NPE also supports this conclusion, because at least one PCNA trimer must be involved in DNA synthesis at the gap. It is unlikely that RFC determines the strand specificity of MMR in our experiments, because amounts of RFC remained on DNA were insufficient to explain the efficiency of MMR. Based on the above evidence, we suggest that PCNA would function as the strand discrimination signal for MMR after the disappearance of local strand discontinuities during DNA replication. A series of seminal studies from the Modrich lab has led to the model in which DNA-bound PCNA activates the MutL\u03b1 nicking endonuclease to initiate strand specific MMR (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kadyrov et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Pluciennik et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">2013</a>). Our data are consistent with this prevailing model, since 1) DNA-bound PCNA induced strand-specific MMR in NPE, and 2) PCNA-directed MMR in NPE was completely dependent on the MutL complexes. As gap-directed MMR in NPE was bidirectional and preferentially degrades the DNA strand through the shortest path from the gap to the mismatch, we assume that the PCNA-directed MMR would function in the same manner. If so, the strand excision complex presumably built upon a specific face of PCNA would catalyze strand degradation in either direction depending on the relative orientation toward a mismatch. How this can be achieved is an important next question, and the system established here will be a useful tool to investigate this mechanism. However, since our plasmid substrates carry multiple PCNA molecules with free sliding ability, we currently do not exclude a possibility that PCNA-directed MMR catalyzes only a specific direction of strand excision, and PCNA molecules localized on a specific side toward a mismatch are preferentially used for MMR."

A recent study showed that DNA polymerase \u03b4 captures DNA-bound PCNA which is otherwise quickly unloaded by the clamp-unloading activity of RFC (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hedglin et al., 2013</a>). It would be possible that MutS\u03b1 inhibits PCNA unloading in a similar manner; binding of the PIP motif onto PCNA may physically prevent the engagement of PCNA with RFC. Since in vivo\u00a0PCNA unloading during S-phase largely depends on the Elg1-containing RFC-like complex (Elg1-RLC) both in humans and in yeast (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kubota et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Shiomi and Nishitani, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kubota et al., 2015</a>), the PIP-motif in MutS\u03b1 may also limit the access of Elg1-RLC to DNA-bound PCNA.

Although a significant portion of this linker in human MutS\u03b1 seems to adopt a globular conformation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Iyer et al., 2008</a>), MutS\u03b1 might be able to retain PCNA that is located far from MutS\u03b1 using this long 'PIP-arm', possibly even over nucleosomes. In this scenario, strand removal would initiate when MutL\u03b1 reaches to PCNA that is retained by the PIP-arm of MutS\u03b1. This could be accomplished either by sliding of MutS\u03b1-MutL\u03b1 complexes along the DNA contour, or through loading of multiple MutL\u03b1 molecules on DNA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hombauer et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Qiu et al., 2015</a>). Interaction between PCNA that is retained by MutS\u03b1 and MutL\u03b1 may invoke a specific strand degradation pathway, because a recent study in yeast has suggested that recruitment or retention of PCNA by MutS\u03b1 around mismatches activates a specific strand removal pathway that is independent of Exo1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Goellner et al., 2014</a>). As seen for MutS\u03b1, we predict that MutS\u03b2 may inhibit PCNA unloading as well, since the NTR of yeast Msh6 and Msh3 are inter-exchangeable without significant deleterious effects (<a href=\"#bib66\">Shell et al., 2007</a>). However, because NTRs of MutS\u03b1 and MutS\u03b2 likely\u00a0possess different characteristics such as the PWWP domain found only in vertebrate Msh6 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Clark et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Laguri et al., 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib26\">Iyer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 2013</a>), this point will need rigorous investigation."

Considering the fact that we quantified PCNA after several washing steps, our quantification almost certainly underestimated the number of PCNA molecules on DNA. Alternatively, PCNA and/or a gap could induce structural alteration of MutS\u03b1 (and possibly other chromatin binding factors), to maintain the strand information. How MutS\u03b1 retains strand memory independently of the NTR will be an interesting question for future studies."

After the completion of local DNA synthesis, <i>e.g.</i> after ligation of Okazaki fragments, PCNA remains on DNA for a certain period until unloaded by an Rfc3-containing complex(es) (<i>t<sub>1/2</sub></i> = ~2\u2009min in NPE; <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, [2]). The MMR system utilizes such PCNA as strand memory. However, if PCNA is not available closely adjacent to mismatches, MutS\u03b1 (and possibly MutS\u03b2 also) retains available PCNA with its long 'PIP-arm', to maintain strand memory for subsequent MMR (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, [3]). This mode of memory survives for &gt;30\u2009min in NPE, and perhaps even longer in cells. In addition to the PIP-dependent tethering of MutS\u03b1/\u03b2 to the replication fork (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kleczkowska et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hombauer et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Haye and Gammie, 2015</a>), we suggest that the PIP motif would contribute to the replication fidelity through this mode of strand memory. Yeast studies have shown that the PIP motif has an assistive but not essential role in MMR (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Flores-Rozas et al., 2000</a>). The PIP-deficient MutS\u03b1 complexes were proficient in repairing a mismatch in our in vitro\u00a0MMR system (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and similar observations were already reported both in human cell extracts and in\u00a0a yeast in vitro reconstitution system (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kleczkowska et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Iyer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bowen et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, a simple MMR reaction involving a mismatch and a closely-placed strand-discrimination signal, either PCNA or a strand discontinuity, would not require retention of PCNA by MutS\u03b1. However, when a stepwise incubation, which mimics transient arrest of the MMR reaction, was involved, the PIP motif became important for MMR (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). We speculate that inhibition of PCNA unloading is needed for MMR only under specific situations, <i>e.g.</i> when a strand-discrimination signal is buried within chromatin. In such difficult-to-repair situations, successful MMR may rely on the maintenance of the strand signals by MutS\u03b1. Since the leading strand seems to have less PCNA than the lagging strand (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yu et al., 2014</a>), such situations could happen more frequently in the leading strand, in which MMR is less efficient than in the lagging strand (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pavlov et al., 2003</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib50\">Lujan et al., 2014</a>). An interesting possibility worth testing in the future would be that MutS\u03b1 may take over PCNA from other factors such as DNA polymerases. Hijacking PCNA from polymerases may not be overly deleterious to DNA synthesis, because new PCNA loading at the 3\u2019-terminus would quickly restore the PCNA-polymerase complex. Similar hijacking might occur on other PCNA interactors such as CAF-1 and FEN-1, both of which are reported to show complex interplay with MutS\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kadyrova et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sch\u00f6pf et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kadyrova et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). On the leading strand that has less PCNA, such competition could be important for effective MMR."

Although <i>E. coli</i> MMR seems to function with strand discontinuities occurring at the replication fork, GATC methylation plays a critical role in maintaining the temporal window permissive to MMR. Strand discontinuities are clearly strand discrimination signals in eukaryotic MMR in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">Holmes et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Thomas et al., 1991</a>). There is also concrete evidence that single-strand DNA termini such as 5\u2019-ends of the Okazaki fragments or strand breaks generated by ribonucleotide excision repair contribute to MMR in vivo(<a href=\"#bib57\">Pavlov et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Nick McElhinny et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ghodgaonkar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Liberti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lujan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). We suggest that, in addition to such DNA termini, two modes of strand memory, somewhat resembling short-term and long-term memories in neuroscience, would operate as functional parallels of GATC methylation in <i>E. coli</i>. Analogous reactions could operate in bacteria and archaea lacking the methyl-dependent MMR (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pillon et al., 2015</a>), and it would be interesting to study dynamics of the replication clamp in such organisms. Further investigation of the regulation of PCNA dynamics by MMR both in NPE and in vivo will lead to a more detailed understanding of complex interplay between the MMR system and the replication complex."

Previous studies using a circular heteroduplex have established that regardless of nick orientation (i.e., 5' or 3') to the mismatch, MMR always occurs along the shorter distance between these two sites. If MutS protein interacts with PCNA through the front face of PCNA, MutS\u03b1 and other MMR proteins recruited by MutS\u03b1 to A-gap and C-gap substrates should be lined up in different polarities/orientations, which would suggest that repair in one substrate occurs along the shorter spin and the other in longer spin.

Although MutS protein has been shown to be able to slide along the DNA, increasing evidence (both in vivo and in vitro) suggests that MutS protein does not travel once it binds to a mismatch. The authors suggest that the stand signal carried by PCNA is transmitted to MutS\u03b1 when the latter interacts with PCNA through its PIP box. Given that the mismatch is ~300 bp away from the gap site, where PCNA is located, it is impossible for MutS protein to reach PCNA. How could this interaction occur?"

On the one hand, the PIP motif in MutS\u03b1 should be in principle dispensable for MMR. Previous genetic studies in yeast have shown that the PIP motif is important but not essential for MMR. Three previous studies (Kleczkowska et al., <i>Genes Dev</i>, 2001, Iyer et al., <i>J Biol Chem</i>, 2008, and Bowen et al., <i>Proc Nat Acad Sci</i>, 2013) have already shown that PIP-deficient MutS\u03b1 can promote MMR either in human cell extracts or in a reconstituted system. Although Kleczkowska et al. have seen a partial reduction in the MMR efficiency with PIP deletion, other two studies agree that PIP-deficient MutS\u03b1 is essentially as active as the wild-type protein for in vitro MMR that uses plasmid substrates. A series of seminal studies from the Modrich lab has shown that it is MutL\u03b1 that initiates strand removal during MMR. This point is related to Major issue 2, and discussed there in detail (Discussion, third paragraph). Both in vivo data and in vitro analyses indicate that the PIP motif in MutS\u03b1 is not essential for activation of MutL\u03b1."

As mentioned already, although not essential, the PIP motif has an important role in MMR, since its deletion shows substantial increment of spontaneous mutation rates in yeast cells. The discrepancy between the in vivo observation and in vitro experiments suggest that (1) the PIP-dependent inhibition of PCNA unloading is important under specific situations that occur in vivo, and (2) plasmid-based in vitro MMR systems may not recapitulate such situations. Interestingly, once stepwise incubation, which mimics transient arrest of the MMR reaction, was involved, the PIP motif became important for the MMR efficiency in an in vitro assay (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Therefore, it would be reasonable to speculate that the PIP motif becomes important for MMR under a certain \u201cdifficult-to-repair\u201d situation, e.g. when PCNA is buried in chromatin.

Indeed, we showed that depletion of Rfc3, a common subunit of all four RFC-like complexes, significantly slows down the unloading reaction in NPE. It has been known that canonical RFC can catalyze both loading and unloading of PCNA. In addition, the Elg1-containing RFC like complex is largely responsible for PCNA unloading from post-replicative DNA during S phase. Therefore, we speculate that either or both of them would be involved in the unloading of PCNA from circular DNA substrates in NPE. Unavailability of specific antibodies against <i>Xenopus</i> Rfc1 or Elg1 prevented us to distinguish which one is primarily responsible for PCNA unloading. However, the identity of the relevant unloader does not affect our conclusion that MutS\u03b1 prevents the unloading of PCNA.
