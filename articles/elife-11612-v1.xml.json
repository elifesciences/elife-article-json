How polarizing signals coordinate metabolic and functional reprogramming, and the potential implications for control of macrophage activation, remains poorly understood. Here we show that IL-4 signaling co-opts the Akt-mTORC1 pathway to regulate Acly, a key enzyme in Ac-CoA synthesis, leading to increased histone acetylation and M2 gene induction. Only a subset of M2 genes is controlled in this way, including those regulating cellular proliferation and chemokine production. Moreover, metabolic signals impinge on the Akt-mTORC1 axis for such control of M2 activation. We propose that Akt-mTORC1 signaling calibrates metabolic state to energetically demanding aspects of M2 activation, which may define a new role for metabolism in supporting macrophage activation."

How polarizing signals coordinate metabolic and functional reprogramming, and the potential implications for control of macrophage activation, remains poorly understood. Here we show that IL-4 signaling co-opts the Akt-mTORC1 pathway to regulate Acly, a key enzyme in Ac-CoA synthesis, leading to increased histone acetylation and M2 gene induction. Only a subset of M2 genes is controlled in this way, including those regulating cellular proliferation and chemokine production. Moreover, metabolic signals impinge on the Akt-mTORC1 axis for such control of M2 activation. We propose that Akt-mTORC1 signaling calibrates metabolic state to energetically demanding aspects of M2 activation, which may define a new role for metabolism in supporting macrophage activation."

Their ability to acquire diverse, context-dependent activities requires activation (or polarization) to distinct functional states, triggered by various factors including microbial products, cytokines, and growth factors\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Davies et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Murray and Wynn, 2011</a>). M1 or classical activation is triggered during infection by microbial products including LPS, leading to the transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding antimicrobial activities and inflammatory cytokines. M2 or alternative activation is triggered by IL-4 and IL-13 produced during parasite infections, and activates the transcription factor Stat6 to induce a transcriptional program that coordinates fibrosis, tissue remodeling, and Type 2 inflammation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davies et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Murray and Wynn, 2011</a>). Therefore, the induction of multi-component transcriptional programs underpins macrophage activation."

An emerging view is that macrophage activation to particular states is associated with distinct metabolic shifts (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pearce and Everts, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Galv\u00e1n-Pe\u00f1a and O'Neill, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Biswas and Mantovani, 2012</a>). For example, M1 macrophages upregulate glucose and glutamine utilization (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tannahill et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cramer et al., 2003</a>), while M2 macrophages augment \u03b2-oxidation and glutamine consumption (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vats et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jha et al., 2015</a>). Importantly, such metabolic shifts critically support macrophage activation. Increased glycolytic flux in M1 macrophages is coupled to de novo lipogenesis, which enables ER and Golgi expansion and production of high levels of inflammatory cytokines (<a href=\"#bib15\">Everts et al., 2014</a>). Another consequence of enhanced glycolysis is accumulation of the TCA cycle metabolite succinate, leading to stabilization of the transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1 and transcriptional induction of <i>Il1b</i> and other target genes in the M1 macrophage (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tannahill et al., 2013</a>). How oxidative metabolism boosts M2 activation is not clear, but glutamine metabolism fuels production of UDP-GlcNAC, an important modification of multiple M2 markers (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jha et al., 2015</a>)."

Limited studies indicate that perturbing the activity of these metabolic regulators impairs macrophage metabolism and activation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Everts et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng et al., 2014</a>). For example, Akt mediates enhanced glycolysis to support lipid synthesis and inflammatory cytokine secretion in M1 macrophages (<a href=\"#bib15\">Everts et al., 2014</a>). Akt similarly stimulates glucose-fueled lipid synthesis in growing and proliferating cells, where lipids are used to build cellular membranes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Robey and Hay, 2009</a>). Therefore, M1 macrophages co-opt a metabolic process (Akt-dependent lipogenesis) in order to coordinate a macrophage-specific function (inflammatory cytokine secretion). In general, however, how polarizing signals control metabolic shifts, and the full implications of this for control of macrophage activation, remains poorly understood."

Consistent with its role as an important metabolic sensor, the Akt-mTORC1 pathway couples metabolic input to such gene-specific control. Our findings also reveal subsets of the M2 response, including chemokine production and cellular proliferation, that are linked to metabolic state by Akt-mTORC1 signaling."

We found that BMDMs increased glucose uptake in a time-dependent manner in response to IL-4 treatment. Such increase was reduced by cotreatment with the Akt inhibitor MK2206 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating control by Akt and consistent with a role for Akt in regulating glycolysis in many settings (<a href=\"#bib37\">Robey and Hay, 2009</a>). Moreover, enhanced glucose consumption in M2 macrophages was associated with an Akt-dependent increase in both glycolysis and oxidative metabolism, as indicated by extracellular flux assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Importantly, glycolytic flux was needed for optimal implementation of the M2 program. Similar to the \u03b2-oxidation inhibitor etomoxir, the glycolysis inhibitor 2-DG reduced IL-4-mediated induction of some M2 genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Therefore, Akt mediates enhanced glucose consumption in M2 macrophages, and this contributes to induction of M2 gene expression. Such glucose consumption may also fuel production of UDP-Glc-NAc, the substrate for glycosylation of some M2 markers (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jha et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, Akt does not control \u03b2-oxidation in M2 macrophages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

We examined induction of <i>Retnla, Arg1, Mgl2, Chi3l3, Cd36</i>, and <i>Fabp4</i>, \u201challmark\u201d M2 genes commonly used in studies of M2 activation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Van Dyken and Locksley, 2013</a>). Consistent with the role of Stat6 as a transcriptional master regulator of M2 activation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Odegaard and Chawla, 2011</a>), induction of these M2 genes was ablated in Stat6 KO BMDMs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Importantly and as reported (<a href=\"#bib7\">Byles et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ruckerl et al., 2012</a>), Akt activity controlled the induction of a subset of M2 genes. In the presence of the Akt inhibitor MK2206, induction of <i>Arg1, Retnla</i>, and <i>Mgl2</i> was reduced ~40\u201380%, while <i>Chi3l3, Cd36</i>, and <i>Fabp4</i> were not affected (or even super-inducible) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Use of a structurally distinct Akt inhibitor, Aktviii, yielded similar results, suggesting specificity in inhibition (data not shown).

Stat6 activity as measured by a Stat6-dependent luciferase reporter was also not impaired by inhibition of Akt activity (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

A seminal study from Wellen and colleagues indicated that in cancer cells and differentiating adipocytes, metabolic state is linked to gene expression via effects on histone acetylation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wellen et al., 2009</a>), thus we hypothesized that Akt may control histone acetylation to regulate M2 gene expression. Indeed, IL-4-treatment of BMDMs enhanced global acetylation of H3 and H4 histones, as indicated by western blot of whole cell lysates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>).

In contrast, tubulin acetylation was not modulated by IL-4 treatment (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). We next examined gene-specific patterns of H3 and H4 acetylation by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. IL-4 treatment increased H3 and H4 acetylation at promoters of M2 genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), with the degree of inducible acetylation correlating fairly well with the degree of gene induction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Interestingly, such increases in H3 and H4 acetylation were reduced by an Akt inhibitor at M2 genes induced in an Akt-dependent manner (<i>Arg1, Retnla, Mgl2</i>), but not at M2 genes induced independently of Akt (<i>Chi3l3, Cd36, Fabp4</i>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). Pol II recruitment to M2 gene promoters paralleled H3 and H4 acetylation, and was controlled by Akt at M2 genes induced in an Akt-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Together, these findings support the hypothesis that Akt regulates histone acetylation and Pol II recruitment at a subset of M2 genes."

Indeed, we found that induction of Akt-dependent M2 genes was deficient in BMDMs lacking Raptor, a defining subunit of the mTORC1 complex (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dibble and Manning, 2013</a>). In contrast, induction of Akt-independent M2 genes was not reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). mTORC1 is known to stimulate Acly expression (<a href=\"#bib36\">Porstmann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">D\u00fcvel et al., 2010</a>), and we found that <i>Raptor</i>-deficient BMDMs expressed lower levels of Acly protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Conversely, BMDMs with constitutive mTORC1 activity resulting from deletion of <i>Tsc1</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Byles et al., 2013</a>), a negative regulator of mTORC1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dibble and Manning, 2013</a>), displayed elevated Acly levels that were reduced by treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, we noted that IL-4-inducible Acly phosphorylation was reduced in <i>Raptor</i>-deficient BMDMs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This raises the possibility that mTORC1 could also regulate Acly activating phosphorylation, through mechanisms that remain to be clarified in future studies. Taken together, these data indicate that the Akt-mTORC1 axis controls Acly activating phosphorylation and protein levels, likely contributing to its control of M2 activation."

                                "text": "The Akt-mTORC1 pathway is a major metabolic sensor, and mTORC1 activity in particular is controlled by amino acid levels, ADP/ATP levels, and other metabolic inputs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dibble and Manning, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</a>). Therefore, we considered that incorporation of the Akt-mTORC1 pathway into IL-4 signaling, parallel to canonical Jak-Stat signaling, may allow particular subsets of the M2 transcriptional program to integrate signals reflecting the cellular metabolic state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Amino acids directly and potently regulate mTORC1 activity independent of the TSC complex (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dibble and Manning, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</a>) and can also activate Akt in some contexts (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tato et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Novellasdemunt et al., 2013</a>), hence we varied amino acid concentrations as a way to modulate Akt-mTORC1 activity. As expected, mTORC1 activity, as assessed by phosphorylation of its downstream target S6K, was greatly reduced in amino acid deficient media and intermediate in media containing low levels of amino acids (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In line with (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tato et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Novellasdemunt et al., 2013</a>), increasing amino acid levels also augmented Akt activation, as indicated by enhanced phosphorylation on two critical residues, T308 and S473 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Titrating amino acids had no effect on Stat6 phosphorylation and activation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), validating the use of this experimental model to modulate the Akt-mTORC1 axis independent of canonical Stat6 signaling. Consistent with effects on mTORC1 and Akt activity, amino acid levels dose dependently increased Acly phosphorylation and protein levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) as well as Ac-CoA production (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Importantly, amino acids potentiated induction of Akt-dependent but not Akt-independent M2 genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This effect of amino acids was at least partially Raptor-dependent, indicating a critical role for mTORC1 in this process (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Importantly, leucine deficiency selectively reduced expression of Akt-dependent M2 genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>).

Specifically, we found that Akt activation was increased in the fed state compared to the fasted state in the ATM-containing stromal vascular (SVF) fraction of the white adipose tissue (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Although we were unable to reliably detect pAcly or Acly in the SVF for technical reasons, global H3 acetylation (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>) and M2 gene expression (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) followed a similar pattern and were elevated in the fed state.

While barely missing the stringent cutoffs that we set for the RNA-seq analysis, qPCR analysis confirmed coregulation of <i>Ear2, Ear11</i>, and <i>Ear12</i> genes by the Akt-Acly pathway (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). <i>Ear</i> genes are of interest because <i>Ear2</i> and <i>Ear11</i> are thought to have chemoattractant activity for dendritic cells and macrophages and are known to be highly induced in settings of Type 2 inflammation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cormier et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yamada et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, the transcriptional profiling analysis indicated that the Akt-Acly pathway controls selective subsets of the M2 program to allow their modulation by metabolic input (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). As M2 macrophages play a key role in metabolic homeostasis, parasite infection, allergic diseases, and wound healing and tissue repair (<a href=\"#bib46\">Van Dyken and Locksley, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Odegaard and Chawla, 2011</a>), these findings are relevant for metabolic control of macrophage function in diverse contexts."

In the context of cellular proliferation, for example, Akt-mTORC1 activity couples growth factor signaling and nutrient availability to the synthesis of proteins, lipids, and nucleotides (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dibble and Manning, 2013</a>). In contrast, the role of the Akt-mTORC1 pathway in macrophages is much less intuitive.

This is supported by our findings that IL-4 signaling leads to parallel and independent activation of the Akt-mTORC1 pathway and the canonical Jak-Stat pathway, allowing the Akt-mTORC1 axis to regulate a subset of M2 genes through control of Acly activity/expression, Ac-CoA production, and histone acetylation. Why should some but not other components of the M2 response be regulated in this way? Control of cellular proliferation is intuitive, since Akt-mTORC1 signaling acts as a metabolic checkpoint in the context of cellular division to allow growth and proliferation only when nutrients are abundant. What about chemokines? We propose that chemokines may be controlled by the Akt-mTORC1 pathway because of their key role in amplifying energetically costly immune responses (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hotamisligil and Erbay, 2008</a>). This allows metabolic status to calibrate immune responses such that inflammation is amplified and sustained only under metabolically favorable conditions. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that a critical role for Akt-mTORC1 signaling in activated CD8\u2009T cells is to support their migration to sites of inflammation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Finlay and Cantrell, 2011</a>). Therefore, Akt-mTORC1 signaling regulates both facets of immune response amplification, i.e., the ability of tissue-resident sentinel cells to mobilize activated leukocytes and of activated T cells to be recruited. Together these findings add another dimension to our emerging understanding of how metabolism supports leukocyte activation and immune responses."

Such specificity is most likely conferred by HATs with distinct K<sub>m</sub> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pietrocola et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, our analysis suggests that p300 may preferentially regulate at least a subset of the Akt-dependent M2 genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Its high K<sub>m</sub> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mari\u00f1o et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Pietrocola et al., 2015</a>) may allow p300 to link metabolic status and Akt/mTORC1 activity, in the form of Ac-CoA levels, to histone acetylation and transcriptional induction at some M2 genes (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In contrast, HATs at Akt-independent M2 genes may have a low K<sub>m</sub> and are thus insensitive to such modulation of Ac-CoA levels. Presumably, differential HAT recruitment is mediated by distinct transcription factors at Akt-dependent and independent M2 genes, which would be important to address in future studies."

Here, we use <i>Raptor</i>\u25b3/\u25b3 BMDMs to show that mTORC1 activity stimulates M2 activation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Furthermore, amino acids modulate mTORC1 activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) to potentiate M2 gene induction in a Raptor-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together these findings indicate that the Akt-mTORC1 signaling module supports M2 activation. Acly appears to be a key target, with its expression levels and activating phosphorylation controlled by mTORC1 and Akt respectively. In seeming contrast to these data indicating that mTORC1 supports M2 activation, we and others have shown that aberrantly increased mTORC1 activity in <i>Tsc1</i>-deficient BMDMs attenuates M2 activation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Byles et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhu et al., 2014</a>). We hypothesize that the difference between the two models reflects divergent control of M2 activation by physiological and pathophysiological mTORC1 activity respectively. Downstream of the insulin receptor, such context-dependent roles of mTORC1 are well-established. In lean/healthy animals, mTORC1 critically mediates insulin signaling in metabolic tissues (to coordinate postprandial nutrient storage), but in obesity, chronic nutrient excess leads to an aberrant increase in mTORC1 activity that contributes directly to insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</a>). Similarly, while physiological mTORC1 activity couples metabolic input to M2 activation, pathophysiological mTORC1 activation during chronic nutrient excess may impair M2 activation. It would be interesting to see if the latter is true in adipose tissue macrophages in the context of diet-induced obesity, and if so, the consequences for tissue inflammation and metabolic homeostasis."

Such delay may reflect a need for other inputs that facilitate Akt-mediated Acly phosphorylation, or the reduced sensitivity and dynamic range of the pAcly antibody compared to the pAkt antibodies. Once pAcly is detectable at ~2\u2009h, Akt and Acly phosphorylation nicely parallel and steadily increase up to (and perhaps beyond) 8\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). As expected, inducible Akt and Acly phosphorylation precede increases in global histone acetylation, which is observed starting only at 4\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, Ac-CoA levels increase only 8\u2009hr after IL-4 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). One possibility, supported by the increase in global histone acetylation at 4\u2009h, is that diversion of Ac-CoA into acetylated histones diminishes the free Ac-CoA pool. Another possibility is that because the LC-MS analysis measures bulk Ac-CoA rather than the nuclear-cytoplasmic pool relevant for histone acetylation, changes in mitochondrial Ac-CoA levels could be confounding. Again, global histone acetylation, which may more accurately reflect nuclear-cytoplasmic pools of Ac-CoA, increases 4\u2009hr after IL-4 treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), as does gene-specific increases in histone acetylation at Akt-dependent M2 genes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Therefore, we believe that the preponderance of the data support our model that IL-4 triggers Ac-CoA production and histone acetylation as a consequence of Akt-mediated Acly activation."

Here we show how the Akt-mTORC1 axis couples metabolic input in the form of Ac-CoA levels to histone acetylation and gene regulation, and importantly, to control specific subsets of the M2 program. In addition to a recent study (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 2014</a>), this is only the second example of how Akt-Acly signaling controls gene regulation through histone acetylation. Other macrophage polarizing signals and common gamma chain cytokines (\u03b3<sub>c</sub>) (e.g. IL-2, IL-15) engage the Akt-mTORC1 axis, thus our findings may have implications for multiple programs of macrophage polarization and leukocyte activation. Canonical signaling downstream of the polarizing signal or \u03b3<sub>c</sub> specifies which genes are induced, while regulation of Ac-CoA levels and histone acetylation by the Akt-mTORC1-Acly pathway allows metabolic input to calibrate genes encoding energetically demanding processes; it would be informative in future studies to determine the nature of these processes. Alternatively, Ac-CoA can be synthesized independently of the Akt-mTORC1-Acly axis by AceCS1 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hallows et al., 2006</a>) or nuclear pyruvate dehydrogenase (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sutendra et al., 2014</a>) to mediate histone acetylation. AceCS1 activity is controlled by SIRT1, thus providing a means for Ac-CoA production and histone acetylation in conditions of low energy or nutrients (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hallows et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, future studies to determine how gene-specific histone acetylation is regulated during different macrophage activation programs are warranted. These studies could pave the way towards new therapeutic approaches of modulating macrophage function in diverse contexts, including Type 2 inflammation, metabolic homeostasis, and antimicrobial immunity."

Inducible pAKT is detected very rapidly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5B</a>) while inducible pACLY is detected starting at ~2 h (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and data not shown). The lag in ACLY activation relative to AKT activation may reflect a need for other inputs that facilitate AKT-mediated ACLY phosphorylation; alternatively, the large dynamic range of AKT phosphorylation (relative to ACLY phosphorylation), likely reflecting the extreme sensitivities of the pAKT antibodies, may enable earlier detection of pAKT. In any case, once pACLY is detectable at ~2h, AKT and ACLY phosphorylation nicely parallel and steadily increase up to (and perhaps beyond) 8 h (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The kinetics of Akt and Acly phosphorylation precede that of global histone acetylation, which is detectable starting at 4 h but not at 2 h (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These data support our model that IL-4 triggers Akt-mediated Acly activation and consequent histone acetylation. (Note that cells are lysed directly in 6x SDS buffer for the histone acetylation blots but NP-40 lysis buffer for the Akt and Acly blots so these are not the same experiments, but we have used the same time course to facilitate direct comparison of the two sets of data. Also, both the Akt/Acly activation and the histone acetylation experiments have been done multiple times over similar time courses with reproducible results, so we believe that experiment to experiment variability is unlikely.)"

One possibility, supported by the increase in global histone acetylation at 4 h, is that diversion of Ac-CoA into acetylated histones lowers the Akt- and Acly-dependent increase in the free Ac-CoA pool. Another possibility is that because our LC-MS analysis measures bulk Ac-CoA rather than the nuclear-cytoplasmic pool that is relevant for histone acetylation, reduced mitochondrial Ac-CoA may offset an early elevation in the nuclear-cytosolic pool of Ac-CoA. Unfortunately, current technologies for Ac-CoA measurements are incompatible with subcellular fractionation, precluding a direct test of this hypothesis. In this regard, the global histone acetylation may be an important complementary analysis that more accurately reflects nuclear-cytoplasmic pools of Ac-CoA. As noted above, the global histone acetylation increases ~4 h after IL-4 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), with similar kinetics to gene-specific increases in histone acetylation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Taken together, we believe that the preponderance of the data including a careful kinetic analysis of pAkt, pAcly, and histone acetylation support our working model.

First, we would like to clarify that the histone acetylation blots are normalized to tubulin and are evenly loaded based on total protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The H3 and H4 acetylation are then normalized to total H3 and H4 respectively, and then quantified by Image J densitometry. Using this protocol, the IL-4-inducible increase in global histone acetylation (normalized for the increase in total histones) is modest but very consistent and reproducible in several independent experiments (representatives of which are shown in the manuscript). We also tried acid extraction of histones as suggested by the reviewer (Epigentek, EpiQuik Total Histone Extraction Kit, Cat # OP-0006). For reasons not clear to us, multiple attempts with the acid extraction protocol indicate no IL-4-inducible increase in global histone acetylation (measured at 2 h intervals for up to 12 h following IL-4 stimulation; data not shown). We are inclined to believe the data obtained with the original protocol rather than the acid extraction for the following reasons: 1) The original protocol yielded extremely consistent/reproducible results over several independent experiments; 2) The correlation of increased histone acetylation with cellular proliferation seen in the original protocol is observed in many other contexts (e.g. PMID: 21596309); 3) Using the original protocol, addition of acetate or the HDAC inhibitor TSA led to the expected increases in global H3 and H4 acetylation (data not shown); and 4) That IL-4-inducible total histone acetylation is Akt-dependent (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A-B</a>) and starts ~4 h is consistent with the other data that we have presented in the manuscript. Therefore, we have left the histone acetylation blots in the manuscript, but defer to the judgment of the reviewers and can remove these blots if needed. A final consideration for keeping the histone acetylation blots in the manuscript is that, as noted above, global histone acetylation may more accurately reflect nuclear-cytoplasmic pools of Ac-CoA than LC-MS measurements of bulk Ac-CoA."

We believe that in addition to and together with Akt, mTORC1 regulates a subset of M2 genes and critically couples metabolic input to induction of these genes. We have now obtained Raptor-deficient BMDMs, and showed that loss of mTORC1 leads to reduced expression of the Akt-dependent M2 genes <i>Arg1, Fizz1, Mgl2, but not Ym1, Fabp4,</i> and <i>Cd36</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This provides strong genetic evidence that physiological mTORC1 activity supports M2 activation. Moreover, the ability of amino acids to modulate Akt-dependent M2 genes is attenuated in Raptor-deficient BMDMs, indicating that mTORC1 is an important part of the mechanism by which amino acid availability calibrates this subset of M2 genes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, these findings implicate physiological mTORC1 activity in control of M2 activation and in linking metabolic input to a subset of M2 genes."

Raptor KO BMDMs lacking mTORC1 have clearly reduced levels of Acly protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Conversely, TSC KO BMDMs with constitutively elevated mTORC1 activity have elevated ACLY levels that are sensitive to inhibition with rapamycin (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, amino acids dose dependently augment total ACLY levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), most likely through mTORC1. Although IL-4 only stimulates a very modest to negligible increase in Acly protein levels (as the reviewers point out), we believe that serum may be driving mTORC1-stimulated Acly protein levels at steady state thus confounding the ability to detect IL-4-inducible increases. In this regard it is interesting to note the clear reduction in the IL-4-inducible pAcly in Raptor-deficient BMDMs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). While the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified in future studies, this raises the possibility that in addition to Akt, mTORC1 could regulate Acly phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate an important role for mTORC1 in controlling Acly protein levels (and perhaps also phosphorylation) in M2 macrophages."
