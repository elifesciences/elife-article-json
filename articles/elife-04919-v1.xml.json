Retrieving objects from memory reinstates components of this activity. In humans, the temporal structure of this retrieved activity remains largely unexplored, and here we address this gap using the spatiotemporal precision of magnetoencephalography (MEG). In a sensory preconditioning paradigm, 'indirect' objects were paired with 'direct' objects to form associative links, and the latter were then paired with rewards. Using multivariate analysis methods we examined the short-time evolution of neural representations of indirect objects retrieved during reward-learning about direct objects. We found two components of the evoked representation of the indirect stimulus, 200 ms apart. The strength of retrieval of one, but not the other, representational component correlated with generalization of reward learning from direct to indirect stimuli. We suggest the temporal structure within retrieved neural representations may be key to their function."

Retrieving objects from memory reinstates components of this activity. In humans, the temporal structure of this retrieved activity remains largely unexplored, and here we address this gap using the spatiotemporal precision of magnetoencephalography (MEG). In a sensory preconditioning paradigm, 'indirect' objects were paired with 'direct' objects to form associative links, and the latter were then paired with rewards. Using multivariate analysis methods we examined the short-time evolution of neural representations of indirect objects retrieved during reward-learning about direct objects. We found two components of the evoked representation of the indirect stimulus, 200 ms apart. The strength of retrieval of one, but not the other, representational component correlated with generalization of reward learning from direct to indirect stimuli. We suggest the temporal structure within retrieved neural representations may be key to their function."

Here, we apply these methods to a simple sensory preconditioning task adapted from <a href=\"#bib96\">Wimmer and Shohamy (2012)</a>. Sensory preconditioning is a well-established paradigm in which subjects first form an association between two stimuli (\u2018direct\u2019 or S<sub>d</sub> and \u2018indirect\u2019 or S<sub>i</sub>) and then form an association between the direct stimulus and a reward (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brogden, 1939</a>). Generalization of value to the indirect stimulus is evidence of retrieving the learned association (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gewirtz and Davis, 2000</a>). Using fMRI, <a href=\"#bib96\">Wimmer and Shohamy (2012)</a> showed that neural representations of the associated indirect stimulus are reinstated when direct stimuli are presented during the Reward-learning phase, and this retrieval is linked to the generalization of value from direct to indirect stimuli. This suggests that reinstatement through the learned associative link may be part of the mechanism for value updating. Our aim here is to explore the temporal structure of this reinstatement, which may help to shed light on the mechanisms of value updating as well as providing general insight into the dynamics of representations during retrieval."

The peak at 400 ms is evident (blue arrow). Absolute classification accuracy is lower than with more coarsely binned data, likely due to a poorer signal to noise ratio."

To test more formally for two distinct peaks in classification, we asked whether there was significant concavity in the evolving classification accuracy in the interval from 200 to 400 ms, by regressing the classification accuracy against linear and quadratic functions of time. At the group level, the quadratic term was significantly different from zero (p = 0.02). We also performed this regression on the accuracy curves from individual subjects; many subjects trended toward a positive quadratic term, but none reached significance at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Finally, to rule out any peculiarities in the SVM algorithm being responsible for two distinct peaks in classification accuracy, we also repeated the same analysis at the group level with a variety of nearest-mean classifiers and found the same pattern (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

The representational similarity analysis in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> suggested that this 400 ms component might preferentially encode stimulus category. Thus, we speculated the value of the associated S<sub>i</sub> category, rather than the value of a particular S<sub>i</sub> stimulus, might be updated when the outcome appears. This could provide a potential explanation for the lack of group-level behavioral preference for S<sub>i</sub>+ over S<sub>i</sub>\u2212 during the subsequent Decision phase, since each S<sub>i</sub> category contained both an S<sub>i</sub>+ and an S<sub>i</sub>\u2212, with equal presentations. This hypothesis predicts that, although at the group level there might be no significant retrieval of the 200 ms component of S<sub>i</sub> representation during outcome presentation, the subjects who did retrieve the 200 ms component of S<sub>i</sub> might have a positive preference for S<sub>i</sub>+ over S<sub>i</sub>\u2212. (Meanwhile, a preference for S<sub>i</sub>\u2212 over S<sub>i</sub>+ should be unrelated to retrieval.) We therefore plotted the correlation between behavioral preference and accuracy of S<sub>i</sub>-trained classifier in predicting the associated category of the S<sub>d</sub> stimulus presented on this trial. This analysis was split according to whether subjects preferred S<sub>i</sub>\u2212 over S<sub>i</sub>+ (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) or S<sub>i</sub>+ over S<sub>i</sub>\u2212 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Remarkably, in subjects preferring S<sub>i</sub>+ over S<sub>i</sub>\u2212, reinstatement of the 200 ms component of S<sub>i</sub> was strongly correlated with behavioral preference. Shuffling subject identities yielded a null distribution of peak log<sub>10</sub> p-values for the correlation of classifier accuracy with behavioral preference. The 400 ms classifier showed no substantial positive correlation with behavioral preference (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), while the 200 ms classifier showed a corrected-significant peak in correlation strength \u223c400 ms after the onset of the outcome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

For instance, in the fMRI study whose design we copied (<a href=\"#bib96\">Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012</a>), univariate methods were used to show the equivalent of S<sub>i</sub> category retrieval during the Reward phase.

In both our study and in the similar design of <a href=\"#bib96\">Wimmer and Shohamy (2012)</a>, behavioral evidence of sensory preconditioning rests wholly on stimulus-specific retrieval (since the rewards associated with each category are balanced). If the 400 ms component of S<sub>i</sub> representation preferentially encodes information about category rather than specific stimuli, as suggested by our representational similarity analysis, retrieval of solely this component at outcome time might cause value learning to be assigned to categories rather than individual stimuli. This hypothesis would explain our finding that the subjects who retrieve the 200 ms component at outcome show behavioral evidence of sensory preconditioning. Under this interpretation, the correlation that Wimmer and Shohamy found in BOLD between retrieved stimulus representations and behavior between subjects may also have been driven by the 200 ms component of the stimulus representation; these temporally precise signals could not be distinguished using fMRI. Although the particular representations online at the time of reward were probably driven by quirks of this task design (since other sensory preconditioning experiments have found robust group-level preference for S<sub>i</sub> paired with rewarded S<sub>d</sub> (e.g., <a href=\"#bib79\">Seidel, 1959</a>)), the finding is of general importance because it suggests that the exact timing of reward relative to fast-evolving neural representational structures is crucial to value updating and credit assignment."

The latter would give a more direct test of the idea that subjects who retrieve a representation of the specific S<sub>i</sub> paired with the particular S<sub>d</sub> viewed on this trial drive larger value updates. Although it is in principle possible to train a classifier to distinguish between individual exemplars of an S<sub>i</sub> category, this did not reach a sufficiently high level of performance in our hands, perhaps limited by the relatively small number of training samples per unique stimulus.

In sensory preconditioning, it is an open question whether generalized values are updated offline (either during the Reward phase or in between the Reward and Decision phases), retrieved through associative links at the time of decision, or a mix of both. In animals the vulnerability of sensory preconditioning to extinction (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gewirtz and Davis, 2000</a>) hints at an online mechanism, but it is equally possible that extinction drives offline value updates through the same generalization mechanism as acquisition. Indeed, although our description of the reinstatement of S<sub>i</sub> suggests that it arises through a distinct process of retrieval, we cannot distinguish this from the subtly different possibility hinted by these ideas that the representation of S<sub>d</sub> changed through the associative learning so that it more closely resembles that of S<sub>i</sub>."

This is consistent with our finding that spatial patterns of activity evoked by different exemplars within a category were relatively distinct and that individual fractals were better classified at this time bin. Conversely, brain activity later than 200 ms post-stimulus is often found to include contextual and other sources of information (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kok, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Tsivilis et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Schiff et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Garrido et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Sanguinetti et al., 2014</a>). In particular, the N400 component of the event-related potential (ERP) in EEG extends from roughly 250\u2013500 ms post-stimulus and appears to be driven at least partly by the medial temporal lobe, which is functionally coupled to sensory cortices (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bar, 2004</a>). The N2pc component of the ERP, which occurs earlier from roughly 200\u2013300 ms post-stimulus, has also been tied to contextually-sensitive processing (<a href=\"#bib9\">Conci et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Schiff et al., 2006</a>), and originates from lateral temporal and parietal sources (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hopf et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Oostenveld et al., 2001</a>).

In the analyses in the main paper, this is controlled by randomizing S<sub>i</sub>\u2013S<sub>d</sub> pairings between subjects. We attempted another way of controlling for this, by training a classifier on all subjects' (except one) S<sub>d</sub>-evoked data (using the category labels of the associated S<sub>i</sub>s), and testing on the left-out subject. If this procedure, repeated across left-out subjects, would produce an above-chance prediction of the S<sub>i</sub> category associated with the displayed S<sub>d</sub>, this would imply that the S<sub>d</sub>-evoked data contain a real representation of S<sub>i</sub>. Unfortunately when we attempted this, the group-level prediction of S<sub>i</sub> category did not reach significance. We speculate this is because the category representation differs substantially between subjects (supported by <a href=\"#bib72\">Sandberg et al.

For example, if one subject in the Decision phase preferred the face paired with the rewarded fractal, but did not prefer the scene paired with the rewarded fractal, then he or she was more likely to have a large fusiform face area activation during presentation of the face-paired fractal in the Reward phase than to have a large parahippocampal place area activation during presentation of the scene-paired fractal. We attempted the same analysis but no correlation with neural decoding reached significance. In our hands collapsing within categories to look at between-subject variance in total value updating appeared more statistically powerful. Along similar lines, we also trained classifiers to distinguish individual stimuli in the Association phase (e.g., a particular face, rather than the category of faces\u2014so the classifier learned about 12 distinct categories), and applied these classifiers to activity at the time of outcome in the Reward phase. The classifier was treated as \u2018correct\u2019 if it predicted the identity of the photograph that had been previously associated with the fractal presented on this trial of the Reward phase. We then correlated the resulting correctness ratings against the behavioral preference for S<sub>i</sub>+ over S<sub>i</sub>\u2212 in the Decision phase (just as in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> of the main paper, but classifying individual stimuli rather than categories). However, these correlations did not reach shuffle-corrected significance. This may be a result of the difficulty of classifying many individual stimuli with relatively few trials."

It is possible that this could represent an online retrieval of value information about S<sub>d</sub> to guide the choice about S<sub>i</sub>. However, we could not detect above-chance classification of either associated S<sub>d</sub> when pairs of S<sub>i</sub> were presented during the Decision phase.

This is a pity because each category was equally often associated with positive and neutral reward. This makes it difficult to assess whether the specific reward-predictive stimuli were reinstated at the point of reward and whether the strength of such reinstatement predicted the propagation of value updates. The authors speculate that category-level reinstatement might explain the absence of significant value updating suggested by their behavioural post-test. They do show that stronger reinstatement of the early component of the category representation just before reward onset predicts subjects' value-based choices in the behavioural post-test. However, although reasonably corrected for multiple testing across latencies, this effect is barely significant and is one of several analyses attempting to establish a relationship between reinstatement of reward-predictive stimuli and value updating. [Reviewing editor: This comment clarifies the reviewers' concern about this issue, but it may not be possible to improve on the comments provided by the authors in the discussion of their findings.]"

Whatever correction the authors use will need to correct for the use of classifiers trained on different time points and also their exploration of multiple time points during the reward learning phase. For what it's worth, I thought that the approach taken in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> (controlling for all time points, but only two classifiers: the 200ms-trained classifier and the 400ms-trained classifier) was acceptable; a similar approach could be applied here, if it isn't being used already."

If they did not measure this, it would be useful to re-do the analysis in a way that obtains self-similarity measurements.

This approach assumes that brain patterns are relatively consistent across participants. If that assumption is generally true, then the 25-fold increase in the number of training patterns can improve classification accuracy by a substantial margin (conversely: if there is extensive between-subject variability in the patterns, then moving to a leave-one-subject out approach can hurt classification accuracy). Anything that improves classification accuracy has the potential to greatly boost the interpretability of these results."

The main claim we can make is that the neural representation of items within a category looks more similar at 400ms than 200ms, compared to between-category items. We have amended our descriptions of this throughout the paper, and excised all references to having less item-specific information at 400ms."

These similarities were not different between 200ms and 400ms (p=0.3 by t-test). Thus, at least with this approach, we can't reach any conclusions about the absolute amount of item-specific information at 200ms versus 400ms. In the future, we think it will be interesting to investigate exactly what is different about the coding of the representations in different time epochs."

While I can understand how variance in the level of reactivation (during the reward learning phase) could lead to variance in participants' preference, ranging from no preference to strong preference in favor of the associated item, but it is not clear how variance in reactivation could lead to the opposite preference. The only other interpretation of the below-chance performance is that it is noise, but in that case, how can it be explained using classifier evidence? It would be useful if the authors commented on this</i>."

This approach assumes that brain patterns are relatively consistent across participants. If that assumption is generally true, then the 25-fold increase in the number of training patterns can improve classification accuracy by a substantial margin (conversely: if there is extensive between-subject variability in the patterns, then moving to a leave-one-subject out approach can hurt classification accuracy). Anything that improves classification accuracy has the potential to greatly boost the interpretability of these results</i>."
