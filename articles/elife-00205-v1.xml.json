                    "text": "CpG islands (CGIs) are associated with most mammalian gene promoters. A subset of CGIs act as polycomb response elements (PREs) and are recognized by the polycomb silencing systems to regulate expression of genes involved in early development. How CGIs function mechanistically as nucleation sites for polycomb repressive complexes remains unknown. Here we discover that KDM2B (FBXL10) specifically recognizes non-methylated DNA in CGIs and recruits the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). This contributes to histone H2A lysine 119 ubiquitylation (H2AK119ub1) and gene repression. Unexpectedly, we also find that CGIs are occupied by low levels of PRC1 throughout the genome, suggesting that the KDM2B-PRC1 complex may sample CGI-associated genes for susceptibility to polycomb-mediated silencing. These observations demonstrate an unexpected and direct link between recognition of CGIs by KDM2B and targeting of the polycomb repressive system. This provides the basis for a new model describing the functionality of CGIs as mammalian PREs."

A subset of CGIs act as polycomb response elements (PREs) and are recognized by the polycomb silencing systems to regulate expression of genes involved in early development. How CGIs function mechanistically as nucleation sites for polycomb repressive complexes remains unknown. Here we discover that KDM2B (FBXL10) specifically recognizes non-methylated DNA in CGIs and recruits the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). This contributes to histone H2A lysine 119 ubiquitylation (H2AK119ub1) and gene repression. Unexpectedly, we also find that CGIs are occupied by low levels of PRC1 throughout the genome, suggesting that the KDM2B-PRC1 complex may sample CGI-associated genes for susceptibility to polycomb-mediated silencing. These observations demonstrate an unexpected and direct link between recognition of CGIs by KDM2B and targeting of the polycomb repressive system. This provides the basis for a new model describing the functionality of CGIs as mammalian PREs."

However, recent work suggests that CpG islands may have a more active role. In particular, it has been shown that specific proteins bind to CpG islands to create chromatin environments that are more favourable for the initiation of gene expression. Moreover, a subset of CpG islands can also bind polycomb-group proteins, including the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) that silence gene expression. These complexes have an important role in the regulation of genes during early development in animals, but the mechanism by which PRC1 recognizes CpG islands in mammals has remained enigmatic."

To achieve this, KDM2B encodes a DNA binding domain that specifically recognizes non-methylated CpG dinucleotides. By interacting biochemically with a variant PRC1 complex, KDM2B then nucleates PRC1 at CpG islands, and PRC1 activity silences certain polycomb target genes in embryonic stem cells. Surprisingly, Farcas et al. also find low but appreciable levels of PRC1 at most CpG islands genome-wide, in addition to the high levels of PRC1 at selected islands: this suggests that KDM2B may sample the whole genome to find CpG islands where PRC1 can establish silencing. An improved understanding of the polycomb repressive system, and the role of CpG islands within it, could lead to new insights into the role of epigenetic mechanisms in mammalian development."

Nevertheless, it remains very poorly understood how the enzymes responsible for initiating these functional chromatin states are targeted to and recognize defined regions of the genome. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underpin these processes is becoming increasingly important given the mounting genetic evidence implicating misregulation of chromatin modifying activities in human disease and cancer (<a href=\"#bib29\">Greer and Shi, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Butler et al., 2012</a>). In mammals, the majority of CpG dinucleotides are methylated on the 5 position of cytosine and this epigenetic modification can be stably transmitted across cell divisions (<a href=\"#bib37\">Klose and Bird, 2006</a>). DNA methylation is thought to be a highly stable modification that helps maintain intergenic and heterochromatic regions in a transcriptionally inert chromatin state (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bird, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Klose and Bird, 2006</a>). A major exception to this pervasive methylation is short contiguous regions of the genome, called CpG islands (CGIs), which lack DNA methylation and are associated with roughly two-thirds of human gene promoters (<a href=\"#bib31\">Illingworth and Bird, 2009</a>). It is thought that CGIs function to buffer gene regulatory elements from the repressive effects of surrounding DNA methylation and therefore play a central role in the regulatory capacity of the genome (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blackledge and Klose, 2011</a>)."

ZF-CxxC domain-containing proteins are found in chromatin modifying complexes and therefore play an unexpected and proactive role in specifying unique chromatin modification architecture at CGI associated gene promoters. For example, the ZF-CxxC domain containing protein CFP1 is a core component of the SET1 histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complex (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lee and Skalnik, 2005</a>) and targets this transcriptionally permissive modification to CGIs genome-wide. Similarly, the KDM2A histone H3K36 demethylase enzyme contains a ZF-CxxC domain that targets the enzyme directly to CGIs where it removes histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) dimethylation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blackledge et al., 2010</a>). In mammals H3K36me1/me2 is found broadly across the genome (<a href=\"#bib60\">Peters et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Robin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blackledge et al., 2010</a>) and may be inhibitory to transcriptional initiation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Strahl et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Carrozza et al., 2005</a>). Specific targeting of KDM2A to CGIs appears to remove H3K36me2 at CGIs as part of a mechanism to mark these regions with transcriptionally permissive chromatin (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blackledge et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, the targeting of these modifications to CGI associated gene promoters generally occurs independently of the transcriptional state of the associated gene (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blackledge et al., 2010</a>). This suggests that ZF-CxxC mediated chromatin modifications function upstream of transcription to create a permissive chromatin environment at gene promoters and demarcate these regions from surrounding non-regulatory regions of the genome (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blackledge and Klose, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Deaton and Bird, 2011</a>)."

PRC1 complexes have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that mono-ubiquitylates H2A on position 119 (H2AK119ub1) (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wang et al., 2004b</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">de Napoles et al., 2004</a>) and PRC2 complexes have histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methyltransferase activity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cao et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Czermin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kuzmichev et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">M\u00fcller et al., 2002</a>).

However, its paralogue, KDM2B, was reported to be concentrated in the nucleolus. Therefore, to examine the properties of endogenous KDM2B and understand how it functions in comparison to KDM2A, an antibody against KDM2B was raised. In contrast to previous reports, we observe that KDM2B is distributed throughout the nucleus and excluded from nucleoli (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Based on these observations, and considering that KDM2B also encodes a ZF-CxxC domain, we set out to examine whether KDM2B had a similar role to KDM2A in binding non-methylated DNA and CGIs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blackledge et al., 2010</a>). In agreement with previous work, recombinant KDM2B was found to bind non-methylated DNA in vitro (<a href=\"#bib40\">Koyama-Nasu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yamagishi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Blackledge et al., 2012</a>) in a manner that is comparable to that of KDM2A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). This suggests that KDM2B, like KDM2A, may recognize non-methylated DNA in vivo and bind CGI elements. To examine this possibility a chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis was carried out to determine the binding profiles of KDM2A and KDM2B genome-wide in mouse ESCs. A visual inspection of these profiles suggests that both KDM2A and KDM2B localize to promoter associated CGIs and are excluded from non-CGI associated promoters (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). When KDM2A and KDM2B ChIP-seq signal was plotted over all transcription start sites (TSSs) that had been segregated based on their classification as CGI or non-CGI associated there was a very specific enrichment of both KDM2A and KDM2B at the CGI associated class of transcription start site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Furthermore, when KDM2A and KDM2B signal was plotted over all CGIs, including those away from gene promoters, there was a very specific spatial localization of both proteins at CGIs with signal intensity peaking at the centre of the island (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Together these observations demonstrate in vivo that KDM2A and B are both bound to CGIs genome-wide."

To begin examining whether there is a specific feature shared amongst KDM2B enriched CGIs, the genes associated with these CGIs were extracted and subjected to gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Interestingly, these genes were significantly associated with GO terms related to embryo development, morphogenesis, and cellular differentiation. In early development and embryonic stem cells, these classes of genes are often targeted by the polycomb repressive complexes and maintained in a poised but silent state until their expression is induced during lineage commitment (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Boyer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bracken et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</a>).

In mammals, there are two general polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) called PRC1 and PRC2 (<a href=\"#bib70\">Shao et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cao et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Czermin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kuzmichev et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">M\u00fcller et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Levine et al., 2002</a>). Previously, ChIP-seq based analysis has been used extensively to examine the location of PRC1 (via RING1B) (<a href=\"#bib74\">Tavares et al., 2012</a>) and PRC2 (via EZH2) genome-wide (<a href=\"#bib59\">Peng et al., 2009</a>). Using this information, KDM2A and KDM2B ChIP-seq was compared to the polycomb repressive complexes in mouse ESCs by examining the signal intensity around all CGI associated gene promoters (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). From the heat maps it was immediately apparent that KDM2A and KDM2B bind in a seemingly equal manner to most CGI associated genes, but a subset of genes are specifically enriched for KDM2B and depleted of KDM2A. In keeping with the gene ontology analysis, the KDM2B enriched target genes segregate almost exclusively with genes enriched for polycomb repressive complex members RING1B and EZH2. Perhaps more surprisingly, the profile of the PRC1/2 components over CGI-associated target genes did not map precisely to the gene TSS but instead tracked with KDM2B binding and the underlying non-methylated DNA signal at these same regions. This striking spatial relationship is apparent at individual genes and also more generally when PRC1/2 components are examined at all polycomb bound genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together these observations suggest that KDM2B, unlike KDM2A and CFP1 (<a href=\"#bib75\">Thomson et al., 2010</a>), is enriched at polycomb associated CGIs. Furthermore, the clear spatial relationship between polycomb repressive proteins, KDM2B, and non-methylated DNA indicates there may be a mechanistic relationship between recognition of non-methylated DNA at CGIs and polycomb repressive complex nucleation."

To achieve this we isolated stable ESC lines expressing epitope-tagged KDM2B and carried out affinity purification from nuclear extract followed by mass spectrometry to identify associated proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). To ensure that any identified interactions were not mediated through DNA or non-specific interactions with the affinity matrix, we also carried out parallel purifications in which the extract had been pre-treated with nuclease to remove any DNA contamination and from a cell line containing only the empty expression vector. In the purifications from extracts containing epitope-tagged KDM2B a series of proteins in addition to KDM2B were identified (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). These included RING1B, YAF2, RYBP, PCGF1, BCOR, and BCORL1. Importantly RING1B is the E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions as the catalytic core of the PRC1 complex and is responsible for mono-ubiquitylation of H2A at position 119 (H2AK119ub1). To verify that endogenous KDM2B interacts with RING1B, KDM2B was immunoprecipitated from ESC nuclear extract and the presence of RING1B in the immunoprecipitates verified by western blotting (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Therefore, KDM2B exists as part of a variant PRC1 complex in mouse embryonic stem cells. This observation is in agreement with recent work in cancer cell lines that identified KDM2B as part of a similar variant PRC1 complex (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gearhart et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">S\u00e1nchez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gao et al., 2012</a>)."

There are six characterized RING1B dimerization partners PCGF1 (NSPC1), PCGF2 (MEL18), PCGF3 (DONG1), PCGF4 (BMI1), PCGF5 (RNF159), and PCGF6 (MBLR). In purifying RING1B complexes we identified five of the six known PCGF subunits and most of the major auxiliary factors known to interact with these complexes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This supports previous observations that RING1B is the central enzymatic component of most PRC1 complexes in ESCs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Illingworth et al., 2012</a>). Although YAF2 and RYBP were both identified in our KDM2B purification, when these proteins were purified independently it became apparent that they are also found in multiple other PCGF containing PRC1 complexes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This indicates that both YAF2 and RYBP can form part of the KDM2B-PRC1 variant complex, but also function as part of other PRC1 complexes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). YAF2 and RYBP are thought to interact directly with RING1B (<a href=\"#bib79\">Wang et al., 2010</a>) suggesting that they are likely to be recruited to the KDM2B-PRC1 complex via RING1B. In the KDM2B purification the only PCGF identified was PCGF1, suggesting that this factor is unique to the KDM2B-PRC1 variant complex. When the PCGF1 complex was purified (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) its composition was almost identical to the KDM2B complex, with the exception that it also included RING1A, an alternative catalytic core of PRC1 that is highly sequence-similar to RING1B but is expressed at greatly reduced levels in ESCs. Therefore, based on our detailed reciprocal complex purifications, KDM2B forms a PRC1 variant complex that includes BCOR, BCORL1, PCGF1, RING1, and YAF2 or RYBP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Interestingly, in agreement with PRC1 purifications from cancer cell lines (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gao et al., 2012</a>), the PCGF1-containing complex associates with RYBP or YAF2 but fails to integrate chromobox domain-containing (CBX) proteins that recognize H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cao et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Wang et al., 2004a</a>). CBX proteins and RYBP/YAF2 are thought to interact with RING1B in a mutually exclusive manner (<a href=\"#bib79\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). This suggests that PCGF1 may play an important role in specifying the capacity of RYBP and YAF2 to associate with RING1B in the KDM2B variant PRC1 complex. Importantly, the inclusion of KDM2B in a PRC1 complex in ESCs suggest that the relationship between KDM2B and polycomb repressed CGIs may be mediated through its direct interaction with PRC1 components."

This may be related to the compact nature of polycomb-repressed regions and the distinct requirement for the ZF-CxxC domain to bind accessible linker DNA (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). However, KDM2B differs from KDM2A and CFP1 in that it is enriched at polycomb repressed CGIs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Based on our biochemical purifications that indicate KDM2B in ESCs is part of a variant PRC1 complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), it remained possible that KDM2B was enriched at polycomb repressed CGIs via a ZF-CxxC domain independent mechanism relying on PRC1. To test this hypothesis we obtained mouse ESCs which lack RING1A and have a floxed allele of RING1B that can be conditionally removed by addition of the drug tamoxifen (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Endoh et al., 2008</a>). Removal of the catalytic core of PRC1 is known to destabilize the remainder of the core PRC1 complex (<a href=\"#bib47\">Leeb and Wutz, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Endoh et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, we first isolated chromatin from wild type and RING1A/B deleted ESC cells and carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation for RING1B and KDM2B. As would be expected, there were high levels of RING1B at polycomb repressed CGI containing genes and the RING1B signal was lost following tamoxifen treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We then analysed the levels of KDM2B at a series of polycomb repressed and non-polycomb repressed CGI associated genes by ChIP and observed only small or no changes in KDM2B binding in the absence of RING1A/B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This suggests that an intact PRC1 complex is not required to target KDM2B to polycomb repressed sites in vivo."

To test this hypothesis we generated stable ESC lines expressing either epitope tagged wild type KDM2B or a version of KDM2B containing a point mutation in the ZF-CxxC domain that ablates binding to CpG dinucleotides. We then isolated chromatin from these cell lines and analysed binding of exogenous KDM2B to CGI targets (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Importantly, WT KDM2B localized specifically to CGIs but a ZF-CxxC mutant failed to bind any class of CGI. This demonstrates that although KDM2B is part of a PRC1 complex its localisation to regular and polycomb repressed CGIs requires the recognition of non-methylated DNA via the ZF-CxxC domain. The capacity of KDM2B to target CGIs in the absence of PRC1 components suggests that KDM2B could function as targeting module for PRC1 and may contribute to polycomb mediated repression."

To achieve this we stably knocked down KDM2B in ESCs using a lentiviral mediated shRNA approach. Knockdown was approximately by 80% at the RNA level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and there was a clear reduction of KDM2B at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Importantly, depletion of KMD2B did not result in destabilization of either the PRC1 or PRC2 complexes allowing us to specifically examine defects resulting from reduced KDM2B (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Microarray based gene expression profiling was then carried out to compare gene expression in the scrambled and KDM2B shRNA lines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Gene expression profiling revealed a substantial number of expression changes with genes being both down-regulated and up-regulated. In total 653 genes changed expression by more than 1.5-fold: 329 had reduced gene expression and 324 had increased gene expression. Based on the association of KDM2B with polycomb repressed genes we then focussed in on the set of 324 genes that are up-regulated in the KDM2B depletion line. Interestingly 24% of these genes are characterized by RING1B occupancy. This is significantly greater than would be expected by chance (1.9-fold enrichment, hypergeometric p=1.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>) and is similar to the percentage of up-regulated genes in the RING1B null ESC cells that are PRC1 targets (<a href=\"#bib48\">Leeb et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, when all gene expression changes are depicted in a volcano plot there is a clear propensity for RING1B occupied genes to have increased gene expression when KDM2B is depleted (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In order to validate the observed up-regulation of polycomb targets in the KDM2B depletion cell lines we analysed a panel of 12 genes determined to be up-regulated based on the microarray using quantitative RT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In this analysis we observed corresponding increases in transcription in the KDM2B depletion line at these polycomb targets. Together these findings indicate that as with the removal of RING1B, depletion of KDM2B leads to up regulation of a subset of polycomb repressed target genes in mouse embryonic stem cells."

To examine this possibility we carried out ChIP-seq analysis for RING1B and KDM2B in the control and KDM2B knockdown cell lines. As expected KDM2B occupancy was greatly reduced in the knockdown cell line, in fitting with the global reduction of KDM2B at the RNA and protein level (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Next we examined RING1B occupancy in the control cell line. We confirmed high levels of RING1B at previously identified RING1B sites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> e.g. <i>Atf3</i> gene). Interestingly however, based on our highly optimized RING1B ChIP protocol we also observed a large number of lower magnitude binding events (\u2018novel\u2019 sites) that did not correspond to sites previously characterized as being occupied by RING1B (\u2018established\u2019 sites) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). To verify that these are bona fide RING1B binding events we carried out conventional ChIP followed by quantitative PCR on a series of these novel peaks in cells where we can conditionally delete RING1B and observed a clear loss of RING1B signal following deletion (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This indicates these lower magnitude peaks correspond to novel RING1B binding events. Interestingly, 68% of the 15,740 newly identified RING1B binding sites overlapped with CGIs, and 77% of these were coupled to transcription start sites. Importantly, a minority of these novel RING1B occupied CGI sites showed detectable EZH2 (23%) or H3K27me3 (20%), indicating that these sites are largely devoid of appreciable PRC2. Including the already characterized RING1B associated CGIs, this means that clear RING1B peaks are detectable at nearly 70% of the 22,849 mouse CGIs genome-wide (<a href=\"#bib32\">Illingworth et al., 2010</a>), and 88% of RING1B occupied CGIs also are bound by detectable levels of KDM2B."

This revealed a specific reduction in RING1B signal at these sites following KDM2B knockdown in fitting with a role for KDM2B in RING1B targeting. This reduction in RING1B binding was evident when the ChIP-seq signal was visualized at individual target genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) and similar changes in RING1B occupancy were observed by conventional ChIP q-PCR analysis at selected RING1B bound CGIs (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Importantly, at sites where RING1B occupancy was affected, loss of binding correlated with the underlying non-methylated DNA signal and KDM2B occupancy (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). These observations indicate that depletion of KDM2B causes a loss of normal RING1B targeting at polycomb occupied CGI regions of the genome, in accordance with the observed reactivation of a subset of polycomb repressed genes in the KDM2B knockdown line."

Interestingly, depletion of KDM2B resulted in an even more dramatic effect on RING1B occupancy at these novel low magnitude sites, suggesting that these RING1B binding events are more dependent on KDM2B. Importantly, the observed reduction in RING1B occupancy at high and low magnitude sites was not due to destabilization of polycomb repressive systems, as the protein levels of both PRC1 and PRC2 components were similar in the wild type and KD cell lines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Together these observations indicate that KDM2B plays a widespread role in targeting RING1B in vivo both at previously identified established polycomb-repressed CGI-associated genes and a novel class of lower magnitude RING1B occupied CGI sites."

A monoclonal antibody for H2AK119ub1 (<a href=\"#bib76\">Vassilev et al., 1995</a>) has been widely used to evaluate H2AK119ub1 in vivo. Unfortunately, this antibody performs poorly under some experimental conditions, notably chromatin immunoprecipitation. To overcome this limitation we generated a novel antibody against a branched peptide encompassing the isopeptide junction between H2AK119 and the Ub chain. Following immunization, a double affinity purification strategy yielded a highly specific H2AK119ub1 antibody that recognizes native H2AK119ub and functions in ChIP (<a href=\"#fig7s1 fig7s2 fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133</a>). Using this novel H2AK119ub1 specific antibody we set out to examine whether depletion of KDM2B affected PRC1 catalysed chromatin modification in vivo. To achieve this we first compared the global level of H2AK119ub1 in the WT and KD cell lines (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Interestingly, depletion of KDM2B results in an approximately 40% global reduction of this modification, indicating that KDM2B contributes significantly to H2AK119ub1 at the genome scale, most likely due to its widespread role in guiding RING1B occupancy. This was not the result of more general changes in chromatin modification as other histone marks including H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were largely unaffected (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

Interestingly reductions in H2AK119ub1 appeared to be restricted to the polycomb target CGIs that were up-regulated in the absence of KMD2B (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This also correlated with a more subtle reduction in H3K27me3 but largely unchanged levels of H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This suggests that although KDM2B plays a role in the nucleation of RING1B at most polycomb associated CGIs, the level of RING1B reduction at individual genes likely dictates the effects on H2AK119ub1 and gene expression. This is in accordance with the recent observation that H2AK119ub1 is important for gene repression mediated by PRC1 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Endoh et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, the level of H2AK119ub1 reduction at individual loci did not appear as dramatic as the global reductions observed by western blotting. One possibility for this difference may be that pervasive KDM2B dependent targeting of PRC1 to CGIs leads to low level deposition of H2AK119ub1 away from established polycomb sites. One can envisage how loss of KDM2B would more dramatically affect this additional pool of H2AK119ub1 resulting in significant global reduction in its abundance. Together these observations suggest that some polycomb repressed sites rely more specifically on KDM2B mediated RING1B occupancy for normal H2AK119ub1 and polycomb mediated gene repression (<a href=\"#bib22\">Endoh et al., 2012</a>)."

By virtue of its physical association with a variant PRC1 complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and through the functionality of its ZF-CxxC domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), KDM2B is required for normal targeting of the catalytic component of the PRC1 complex, RING1B, to CGI elements (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Depletion of KDM2B results in a reduction of RING1B at polycomb repressed CGIs and leads to diminished global H2AK119ub1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This causes reactivation of a subset of polycomb repressed target genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Surprisingly, we also uncover a more widespread association of RING1B with CGIs that is also dependent on KDM2B (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

In most species PRC1 is thought to be mechanistically recruited in a hierarchical manner through chromo-domain mediated recognition of H3K27 methylation at pre-existing PRC2 modified sites (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cao et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Min et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Wang et al., 2004b</a>). This largely places PRC1 as a subservient reader of silencing events initiated by PRC2. However, the singularity of the hierarchal recruitment mechanism has recently been challenged by a series of elegant experiments in mammals demonstrating that although genetic perturbation of the PRC2 complexes reduces PRC1 localization to polycomb repressed CGIs (<a href=\"#bib74\">Tavares et al., 2012</a>), H3K27 independent PRC1 targeting mechanisms are sufficient to maintain H2AK119ub1 and repression at many PRC1 bound targets (<a href=\"#bib68\">Schoeftner et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Pasini et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Leeb et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Tavares et al., 2012</a>). The specific molecular mechanisms underpinning H3K27me3 independent PRC1 targeting nevertheless remain unclear. For example, a PRC1 variant complex containing RYBP and lacking chromobox domain-containing proteins appears to be involved in this process but it is unclear how RYBP would achieve specificity for polycomb targets as it has no inherent chromatin or DNA binding specificity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arrigoni et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Neira et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Tavares et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hisada et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore RYBP depletion appears to destabilize the RING1B protein (<a href=\"#bib74\">Tavares et al., 2012</a>), reducing the effective pool of the enzyme and making it difficult to determine the specific contribution of RYBP to targeting."

                        "text": "Based on our observations that KDM2B is important for RING1B binding to CGI elements, the KDM2B-PRC1 complex provides an alternative mechanism for PRC1 recognition of polycomb repressed CGIs in mammals. KDM2B forms a variant PRC1 complex lacking CBX proteins but interestingly contains RYBP or the related YAF2 protein. In contrast to depletion of RYBP, reduction of KDM2B did not destabilize RING1B, allowing us to demonstrate that KDM2B contributes to the localization of RING1B to target sites in vivo. This targeting event appears to play an important role in the repression of a subset of polycomb target genes through H2AK119 ubiquitylation. Together these observations provide the first mechanistic evidence for the existence of a PRC1 targeting pathway that does not rely on recognition of H3K27me3 but instead interrogates the underlying non-methylated DNA sequence present at CGIs. Based on this work we propose an alternative to the hierarchical model of PRC1 targeting whereby CGIs are recognized by a variant PRC1 complex containing KDM2B through direct binding to non-methylated DNA. Other direct recognition mechanisms based on interactions between site specific DNA binding transcription factors and PRC1 have recently been identified further supporting the concept that DNA information at polycomb repressed sites is important for PRC1 targeting in vivo (<a href=\"#bib63\">Ren and Kerppola, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dietrich et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yu et al., 2012</a>). Together, the hierarchical recruitment system and alternative direct targeting mechanisms likely function in a complementary and in some cases redundant fashion at many polycomb targets in vivo. This is supported by the observation that KDM2B depletion in embryonic stem cells results in up-regulation of only a subset of PRC1 target genes. Therefore, one can envision that polycomb repression, which must be maintained over cell divisions and developmental time scales, may rely on the combined activity of these separate pathways as an important stability component for maintenance of the silenced state."

                        "text": "KDM2B is enriched at polycomb repressed sites in vivo, but genome-wide analysis revealed it is also more broadly associated with CGIs. Based on this observation, an interesting question remains regarding how KDM2B specifically contributes to PRC1 recognition of polycomb targets, while also binding to CGIs throughout the genome. Our surprising observation that RING1B is detectable at nearly 70% of all CGIs is supportive of a model whereby KDM2B may act as a sampling module allowing PRC1 to be recruited at very low levels to most or all CGIs by virtue of its capacity to recognize CGIs. This would then imply that productive PRC1 enrichment and polycomb mediated silencing is in turn only achieved at a subset of these sampled targets. Fittingly, novel RING1B associated CGIs do not differ in expression from the average gene (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), whereas established polycomb CGIs show reduced expression. This is largely in agreement with recent mechanistic work in mammalian systems studying the capacity of CGIs to attract polycomb mediated repression, where it has been suggested that the default state for CGIs is indeed to acquire polycomb mediated silencing but local chromatin features and other activating marks appear to function to counteract this process (<a href=\"#bib53\">Mendenhall et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lynch et al., 2012</a>). Conceptually this parallels the long held view from genetic and molecular studies in <i>Drosophila</i> that indicate a continual antagonism exists between the function of positively acting trithorax chromatin modifying systems and repressive polycomb systems at PREs (<a href=\"#bib61\">Poux et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Klymenko and M\u00fcller, 2004</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, ultimately this balance is resolved by the local activity of transcriptional regulators. In analogy to the situation at <i>Drosophila</i> PREs, the KDM2B-PRC1 complex may therefore function to continually recruit PRC1 to CGIs at low levels but ultimately only establish the fully PRC1/PRC2 occupied and polycomb repressed state if the appropriate local chromatin and transcriptional environment is met. It is tempting to speculate that PRC1, and perhaps even PRC2 via its poorly characterized DNA binding components (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cao et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Li et al., 2010</a>), may be continually interfacing CGIs in a dynamic manner in order to constantly sample their susceptibility to polycomb repression. Once the conditions are met for polycomb mediated silencing, one can envision a simple feed forward loop may exist where the combined activities of PRC1 and PRC2 stabilize each other through canonical PRC1 complexes that contain CBX proteins recognising H3K27me3 placed by PRC2 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cao et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Wang et al., 2004b</a>) and PRC2 activity favouring the increasingly compacted chromatin state associated with PRC1 occupancy (<a href=\"#bib25\">Francis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Eskeland et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Yuan et al., 2012</a>). This could account for the remarkable spatial correlation between mammalian polycomb repression domains and CGIs at established polycomb repressed sites (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ku et al., 2008</a>). This speculative model is appealing as it would in part explain the co-occupancy of PRC1 and PRC2 at most established polycomb sites in vivo and could reconcile why only certain CGIs are susceptible to acquiring full polycomb complex nucleation and silencing in vivo."

For example, our study has focussed on ESCs where polycomb factors are highly abundant, so it will be imperative to understand if similar KDM2B dependent PRC1 targeting mechanisms function in more committed cell types. Also, it is known that H3K27me3 and CBX dependent PRC1 targeting activities play an important role in RING1B occupancy. Therefore, KDM2B dependent targeting of the PCGF1-PRC1 complex on its own is insufficient to account for the functionality of PRC1 in vivo. This suggests that a complex set of PRC1 targeting mechanisms, perhaps utilizing specific PRC1 complexes, and based on both direct and indirect recognition of CGI associated sites is required for normal PRC1 function. In agreement with this idea, knockdown of KDM2B leads to reactivation of only a subset of polycomb repressed genes. Although this may be due to incomplete removal of KDM2B by RNAi, it may also be related to compensatory function of other PRC1 complexes. Nevertheless, our demonstration that KDM2B links PRC1 to recognition of CGIs provides an important new piece of the puzzle and demonstrates for the first time a direct mechanism for polycomb recognition of CGIs elements in vivo. Importantly, it also provides a novel conceptual framework on which to consider initiation of polycomb mediated silencing."

Interestingly, there is a specific reduction in H3K36me1/me2 at CpG island regions and we recently showed that demethylation by KDM2A contributes to this depletion (Blackledge NP et al 2010). This suggests that a certain amount of H3K36me1/me2 is placed at CGIs but is then actively removed by targeting of demethylase activity. This may function as a way of protecting these CGI associated gene promoter regions from the inhibitory effects of H3K36me1/me2, which is proposed to counteract transcription (Strahl BD et al 2002 and Carrozza MJ et all 2005).
