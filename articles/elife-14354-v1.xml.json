Immune cells are no exception (<a href=\"#bib7\">O\u2019Neill and Pearce, 2015</a>). Macrophages are important immune cells that perform many roles \u2013 they are, for example, involved in development and wound repair \u2013 but they need to be activated before they can carry out their functions. For years it was thought that there were two major subsets of activated macrophages: M1\u2009macrophages that promote inflammation, and M2\u2009macrophages that suppress the immune response. In reality, the distinction between the subsets is less clear, although it is thought that M1\u2009and M2\u2009macrophages have different metabolic profiles and phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib7\">O\u2019Neill and Pearce, 2015</a>). Nevertheless, it is poorly understood how metabolism contributes to the control of gene expression during the activation of immune cells, and how metabolism promotes the M2\u2009phenotype in particular."

First, they analyzed the metabolism of mouse macrophages that had been stimulated with a signaling molecule called interleukin 4 (IL-4) and confirmed several of the metabolic characteristics that were already known about M2\u2009macrophages (e.g. that they show increased breakdown of fatty acids and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria). However, the data also showed a characteristic that had previously been associated with the M1\u2009phenotype (up-regulation of glycolysis). Covarrubias et al. went on to confirm that IL-4\u2009triggered the uptake of glucose in a manner that depended on the kinase Akt. This kinase is well known as a key regulator\u00a0of glucose uptake\u00a0and\u00a0metabolism (<a href=\"#bib8\">Pavlova and Thompson, 2016</a>), and Covarrubias et al show that inhibiting Akt was shown to blunt the activation of some, but not all, M2\u2009genes in response to IL-4."

Previously Akt activation had been shown to promote the phosphorylation of an enzyme called ATP-citrate lyase (or Acly for short). This enzyme converts citrate into acetyl-CoA, a substrate for other enzymes that acetylate histones. Thus, Akt can promote histone acetylation by regulating Acly (<a href=\"#bib4\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). Acetylation of histones in turn causes the DNA nearby to become more loosely packed and allows the genes encoded within the DNA to be expressed. Covarrubias et al. found that stimulation by IL-4\u2009led to increased acetyl-CoA production in the macrophages in a manner that depended on Akt and Acly. Importantly, they also found that IL-4\u2009specifically induced histone acetylation at the promoters of those M2\u2009genes whose expression depended on Akt. Furthermore, this acetylation was reduced if Akt or Acly were inhibited."

Covarrubias et al. found that this pathway promotes the activation of an enzyme called Acly that converts citrate in the cytoplasm (shaded orange) into acetyl-CoA, which supplies the acetyl groups that are involved (via the modification of histones) in the expression of the genes that regulate the activation of M2 macrophages. These genes are involved in cell proliferation and chemokine production. The same pathway also promotes glucose uptake, glycolysis, and the production of acetyl-CoA. The increased levels of fatty acid oxidation in M2 macrophages also lead to more acetyl-CoA in mitochondria (shaded blue). It is possible that this acetyl-CoA is then converted to citrate via the TCA cycle and exported to the cytoplasm. Acly: ATP-citrate lyase;TCA cycle:\u00a0tricarboxylic acid cycle."

These findings suggested that the enzymes might provide a source of acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation that is localized to specific genes.

The breakdown of fatty acids by oxidation (as occurs in M2\u2009macrophages) generates acetyl-CoA in mitochondria. Through citrate export and the activity of Acly, this might lead to more acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm or nucleus, which could then be used to modify gene expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Since the Acly enzyme is typically activated when fatty acids need to be synthesized (rather than oxidized), it is tempting to speculate that Acly might be activated in M2\u2009macrophages primarily to promote histone acetylation at nutrient-responsive genes."

M2\u2009macrophages promote sensitivity to insulin and maintain metabolic health, but they can also support tumor growth. In diseases such as diabetes or cancer, macrophages that are present in obese fat tissue or in tumors often have limited access to oxygen and nutrients, such as glucose, due to poor blood supply (<a href=\"#bib8\">Pavlova and Thompson, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Sun et al. 2011</a>). Recently, glucose restriction within tumors was shown to impair the anti-cancer activity of other immune cells called T cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Sukumar et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, understanding how metabolic conditions within fat tissue or tumors impact the IL-4-Akt-mTORC1-Acly signaling axis could provide new insights into the roles of macrophages in metabolic health and tumor progression. Metabolic context thus plays an important role in determining the activity of macrophages."
