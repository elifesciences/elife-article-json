At a given resolution, an optimal exposure can be defined that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio in the image. Using a 2.6 \u00c5 resolution single particle cryo-EM reconstruction of rotavirus VP6, determined from movies recorded with a total exposure of 100 electrons/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, we obtained accurate measurements of optimal exposure values over a wide range of resolutions. At low and intermediate resolutions, our measured values are considerably higher than obtained previously for crystalline specimens, indicating that both images and movies should be collected with higher exposures than are generally used. We demonstrate a method of using our optimal exposure values to filter movie frames, yielding images with improved contrast that lead to higher resolution reconstructions. This \u2018high-exposure\u2019 technique should benefit cryo-EM work on all types of samples, especially those of relatively low-molecular mass."

At a given resolution, an optimal exposure can be defined that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio in the image. Using a 2.6 \u00c5 resolution single particle cryo-EM reconstruction of rotavirus VP6, determined from movies recorded with a total exposure of 100 electrons/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, we obtained accurate measurements of optimal exposure values over a wide range of resolutions. At low and intermediate resolutions, our measured values are considerably higher than obtained previously for crystalline specimens, indicating that both images and movies should be collected with higher exposures than are generally used. We demonstrate a method of using our optimal exposure values to filter movie frames, yielding images with improved contrast that lead to higher resolution reconstructions. This \u2018high-exposure\u2019 technique should benefit cryo-EM work on all types of samples, especially those of relatively low-molecular mass."

This technique generates images that can be analyzed by computers to produce three-dimensional models of individual viruses, proteins, and other tiny objects. Unfortunately, the samples need to be exposed to high-energy beams of electrons that will damage the sample while the images are gathered, which results in sample movement and blurry images that lack the finer details."

The higher the contrast, the greater the level of structural information that can be obtained, but this requires the use of longer exposures to the electron beam. To overcome this issue, researchers found that instead of recording a single image, it is possible to record movies in which the movement of the sample under the electron beam can be tracked. After the movies are gathered, the movie frames are aligned using computer software to reduce the blurring caused by the sample moving and can then be used to make three-dimensional models."

These findings were used to design an exposure filter that can be applied to the movie frames, allowing Grant and Grigorieff to visualize features of the virus that had not previously been observed by cryo-EM."

A limiting factor in the resolution of EM images of biological specimens is radiation damage because the imaging of such specimens ultimately relies on the interaction of electrons with the sample. Some of these interactions will result in energy being deposited in the specimen, and these will cause radiation damage (<a href=\"#bib14\">Glaeser, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Henderson, 1995</a>). The radiation damage fundamentally limits the information present in the images because the useful signal added per incident electron decreases with increasing electron exposure, while the added noise (image contrast originating from other parts of the sample as well as inelastic scattering) remains approximately constant. If the signal gain per unit exposure is known at a given resolution, an optimal exposure can be chosen that will maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at that resolution (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hayward and Glaeser, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2010</a>)."

These studies demonstrated that higher resolution intensities tend to fade faster than lower resolution intensities, and that the rate of fading for all resolutions is slowed under liquid nitrogen conditions relative to room temperature conditions. The fading of the spots can be described by an exponential decay that is characterized by <i>N</i><sub><i>e</i></sub>, the resolution-dependent critical exposure after which spot intensities are reduced to 1/e of their starting values. To perform similar experiments with non-crystalline material, that is single particles, the resolution-dependent fading of the signal present in an image (or average of images) has to be determined. Unlike diffraction spots obtained from crystals, the signal in an image will give rise to signal amplitudes in the image Fourier transform. The squared Fourier amplitudes are equivalent to crystal diffraction intensities but will be affected by a number of additional factors, for example, the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the microscope and movement of the specimen, both attenuating the amplitudes. However, assuming a linear imaging system and constant amplitude-attenuating factors throughout an exposure series, the rate of fading of the signal in an image can be determined from the fading of the signal amplitudes in the image Fourier transform. While the fading of spots can be measured directly from diffraction patterns, the signal amplitudes calculated from an image are superimposed on the noise generated by the stochastic detection of electrons forming the image, as well as background due to the embedding ice and support film if present. Therefore, instead of measuring signal amplitudes directly, they have to be estimated from measurements of the SNR. Since the exposure, and therefore the noise, in each image within a series remains approximately constant, the SNR is directly proportional to the signal in each image. Analogous to the fading of diffraction spots (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hayward and Glaeser, 1979</a>), the SNR of an image recorded after a prior exposure of <i>N</i> electrons/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> is therefore"

(2010)</a> demonstrated that this relationship is true not just in the case of measurements of instantaneous signal, but also in the case of a detector that integrates measured intensities over time. The SNR of an image will continue to increase with electron exposures larger than the critical exposure. <a href=\"#bib18\">Hayward and Glaeser (1979)</a> showed that the signal present in crystal diffraction spots is maximized at an optimal exposure of \u223c2.5 times the critical exposure. The SNR increase per unit exposure is larger below the optimal exposure than the corresponding rate of SNR decay beyond the optimal exposure; thus, it is typically better to slightly overexpose a specimen than slightly underexpose. An exposure of 2.5 <i>N</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> is also expected to optimize the signal in images at a given resolution due to the analogy between image and crystal data as explained above."

Firstly, recording a series of images with increasing exposure would have led to images with SNRs so low that they would be difficult to analyze. Secondly, until recently the resolutions commonly obtained with the single-particle method were of insufficient quality to follow radiation damage at near-atomic resolution (better than 4 \u00c5). Finally, signal loss due to beam-induced specimen movement (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brilot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Campbell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Scheres, 2014</a>) was hard to quantify, and thus, the effects of radiation damage and movement could not be separated. The recent availability of direct electron detectors (<a href=\"#bib28\">Milazzo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Faruqi and Henderson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2013</a>) has largely alleviated these problems. The ability to record movies instead of single images allows for easy collection of a continuous exposure series, while allowing for measurement and correction of specimen movement (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brilot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Campbell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Scheres, 2014</a>). Furthermore, the improved detective quantum efficiency of the detectors (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ruskin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">McMullan et al., 2014</a>) has enhanced the signal present in the images, and this enhancement combined with motion correction has enabled single-particle reconstructions to reach higher resolutions. In this study, we used a K2 Summit direct detector (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA) to collect a single particle data set of rotavirus double-layered particle (DLP) and estimate the critical exposure of a non-crystalline specimen. Rotavirus DLP is a spherical particle with a diameter of about 700 \u00c5 and a molecular mass of about 70 MDa (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grigorieff and Harrison, 2011</a>). The capsid has icosahedral symmetry and consists predominantly of viral proteins VP2 and VP6, forming an inner and outer layer, respectively. They have a combined mass of about 44 MDa and package 11 or 12 copies of viral proteins VP1 and VP3, as well as 11 dsRNA segments that make up the viral genome (<a href=\"#bib10\">Estrozi et al., 2013</a>). VP6 assembles into 260 trimers that arrange in a <i>T</i> = 13 surface lattice containing a total of 780 VP6 monomers. The <i>T</i> = 13 lattice enables 13-fold averaging of density in addition to the 60-fold icosahedral symmetry. The large size of DLP and its high symmetry make it an ideal specimen for this study, yielding high-contrast particles with very low-alignment errors (<a href=\"#bib20\">Henderson et al., 2011</a>) and almost a thousand averaged subunits per particle."

                                "text": "A complication of using images for the calculation of critical exposure as opposed to diffraction intensities is the beam-induced movement of the specimen. Previous studies have demonstrated that the magnitude of this movement is not constant across a single exposure, typically being greater at the beginning of the exposure than at the end (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brilot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Campbell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Movement of a particle over the course of the exposure will lead to signal degradation, and if the movement is not constant across the entire exposure, it will lead to an exposure-dependent signal degradation unrelated to radiation damage. Non-constant movement across an exposure will therefore interfere with the critical exposure measurement and must be taken into account. In order to do this, we estimated per-frame shifts for each particle using a new movie alignment program called Unblur (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). During subsequent refinement (see below), we also estimated particle rotations by aligning 3-frame sums (see below). On average, particles rotate by \u223c0.9\u00b0 over the course of a movie, or an average of 0.02\u00b0 per three frames. A rotation of 0.02\u00b0 causes a translation of subunits on the surface of DLP of about 0.12 \u00c5, too small to be relevant for our analysis of the fading signal. Movies were recorded such that the specimen was exposed to a total exposure of 100 electrons/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, split over 130 movie frames (0.77 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> per frame). By the 28th frame (an accumulated exposure of 21 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>), the average particle shift per frame had fallen to 0.2 \u00c5, with 95% of particles shifting by less than 0.54 \u00c5 per frame. Between the 28th frame and the 130th frame, the average particle shift per frame remained constant at 0.2 \u00c5, and 95% of the measured particle shift stayed between 0.4 \u00c5 and 0.54 \u00c5 per frame. Because the movement was almost constant between frames 28\u2013130, we do not expect differences in their signal to be significantly affected by translational movement, and for this reason, only frames 28\u2013130 were used during the analysis."

At resolutions higher than 3.8 \u00c5, there were too few points (estimated SNR values) for reliable fitting. At resolutions below 22 \u00c5, the curves became much noisier resulting in poor quality fits. This may be due to the fact that at resolutions below 22 \u00c5, errors due to inelastic scattering become more significant, and the FSC values at these spatial frequencies are so high (typically greater than 0.999) that small errors lead to large changes in the estimated SNR. Additionally, our VP6 reconstruction has only 4 resolution shells at resolutions lower than 22 \u00c5 (nominally at \u223c27 \u00c5, \u223c37 \u00c5, 55 \u00c5, and 110 \u00c5).

A possible explanation is that when imaging crystalline specimens, there are two modes of damage, a short-range component caused by damage to the molecules themselves and a long-range component caused by loss of crystalline order. We would expect single particles to be affected only by the former and so appear to be less radiation sensitive. Rotavirus DLP may also be affected by lattice distortions because the surface lattice formed by the VP6 trimers may be considered analogous to the lattice of a small crystal. However, the extent to which deformations will attenuate signal will depend on the size of the lattice: small deformations can add up to larger unit cell displacements across larger distances compared to displacements across smaller distances. The crystals used for electron diffraction typically measure 1 \u03bcm or more in diameter (<a href=\"#bib37\">Unwin and Henderson, 1975</a>), at least 5 times larger than the circumference of DLP. Furthermore, due to their geometry, 2D and thin 3D crystals are prone to in-plane and out-of-plane distortions, both of which can severely attenuate diffraction intensities. It is therefore essential for crystal diffraction studies to use a flat support film, usually amorphous carbon. Studies of beam-induced motion have shown that the observed motion in cryo-EM specimens involves both the ice and the carbon support (<a href=\"#bib15\">Glaser et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brilot et al., 2012</a>). Some of the beam-induced motion may lead to distortions of the carbon support, causing long-range distortions in the crystals. Beam-induced distortions of the ice layer embedding the DLP particles may also perturb the particle structure. However, the tight packing of the capsids around the RNA genome is likely to yield a particle that is more resistant to distortions than the crystals. We therefore expect that, at least in terms of the structural properties relevant for this study, DLP is much closer to a single particle than a thin crystal. If the icosahedral surface lattice of DLP is also affected by lattice distortions due to radiation damage, we would expect the critical exposure for smaller, less symmetric samples to be higher still. A further difference to the crystal studies is that they used the fastest fading intensities in each resolution bin for their analysis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Unwin and Henderson, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hayward and Glaeser, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Stark et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2010</a>). With a single-particle specimen, we are limited to measuring the average loss of SNR in each resolution bin, which by definition is lower than the fastest fading components. However, the difference between the average and fastest fading components does not appear to be enough to explain the observed differences. Other factors may include the chemical makeup of the specimen, such as the presence of nucleic acids in DLP, as well as buffer and solvent components. However, the effect of these factors on radiation damage is not well understood."

Our results are therefore based upon data, which have effectively been pre-exposed by \u223c20 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>. If radiation damage indeed occurs as a single-exponential process, pre-exposure should have no effect on the result presented here. We cannot exclude the possibility that the damage may occur in two (or more) phases and that we are only observing the final phase, but there is no evidence for a multi-phased process, and previous studies on crystalline specimens also demonstrate a single-exponential decay. Moreover, for lower resolutions at which beam-induced movement is expected to have less of an effect, a plot of ln(SNR) vs accumulated exposure across all frames shows a single-exponential process (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We also note that a reconstruction calculated using only frames 25\u201327 (\u223c19 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>\u2013\u223c21 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>) still yields a 3.35 \u00c5 resolution reconstruction with clear side chain density (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), suggesting that the decay we have measured is relevant to the kinds of structural information we are interested in. As expected, the density of side chains fades with increasing exposure and dose deposited on the sample. The density of carboxyl groups (e.g., Asp29, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) fades most rapidly and is already partially gone after an exposure of about 3 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, while those of aromatic groups (e.g., Tyr24, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) persists even after an exposure of about 35\u201340 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>. This general pattern agrees with that observed before in a number of cryo-EM (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allegretti et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bartesaghi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fromm et al., 2015</a>) and X-ray crystallography studies (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fioravanti et al., 2007</a>). We note also that the density of the \u03b1-helix backbone remains visible even after an exposure of \u223c50 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>. This high exposure exceeds the optimal exposure of about 30 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> at 8 \u00c5 resolution where \u03b1-helical features become clearly visible. Such high tolerance of secondary structural features to radiation damage may help in the alignment of single-particle images recorded using high exposures (see below)."

The lower resolution of this last reconstruction (about 3 \u00c5) is expected due to the effective total exposure of 53 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, which exceeds the optimal exposure at 3 \u00c5 by a factor of 4. The optimal exposure is also exceeded in the case of 19.6 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, albeit only by a factor of 1.5, which does not appear to affect the resolution of the reconstruction significantly. To better follow the effectiveness of the exposure filter, we also plotted the average spectral SNR of the filtered particle images (PSSNR, see above). <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> shows that the SNR of the exposure-filtered sums of all frames equals or exceeds that of the other frame sums at all resolutions. Without exposure filtering, summing all 38 frames produces SNR values that are similar to the filtered sums at low resolution but are significantly lower as the resolution increases. At 3 \u00c5 resolution, the average SNR in the unfiltered sums is only about 30% of that of the filtered sums. The PSSNR curves estimated for the unfiltered sums, calculated from the first 9 and 14 movie frames, start out lower at low resolution than the other two curves as expected since they are missing the additional exposure to boosts the low-resolution signal. At 3 \u00c5 resolution, both curves converge with the curve calculated form the filtered sums using all 38 frames. Based on the effective radiation damage reflected in the data, we would expect the PSSNR at high resolution to be highest for the exposure-filtered sums, followed by the unfiltered sums corresponding to 12.6 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, 19.6 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, and 53 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>. However, in practice, the estimates are subject to some error due to the weak signal at high resolution and the fact that all data sets were independently refined from low resolution (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Therefore, only the data set with the most significant signal attenuation (sums of 38 unfiltered frames) deviates significantly from the rest, and the remaining three curves indicate very similar SNR values."

The benefit of a higher total exposure is not apparent in the alignment of rotavirus DLP because the alignment errors of all tested frame sums is extremely small. Even the resolution of the reconstruction of the 20S proteasome with a total mass of 700 kDa does not appear to be limited by alignment errors at exposures of 12.6 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> and higher (see previous section). To demonstrate improved alignment at higher total exposures when the signal is weak, we generated additional data sets by adding images of areas of empty ice to the proteasome particle images. The ice images were taken from the same micrographs as the particles they were added to, and they contained the same number of frames (total exposure) and filtering. The ice images add approximately the same amount of noise and background that is also present in the particle images, thus, reducing the effective SNR in the resulting images approximately by 50%. At low resolution (special frequencies larger than 1/10 \u00c5<sup>\u22121</sup>), the new data sets should therefore emulate data that would have been obtained by a particle of half the mass, that is, 350 kDa, while at higher resolution (special frequencies smaller than 1/10 \u00c5<sup>\u22121</sup>) the data should approximate the signal expected from a 175 kDa particle, that is, with a quarter of the mass (<a href=\"#bib30\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>)."

Unlike the reconstruction calculated from the exposure-filtered original data (see above), the reconstruction calculated form the exposure-filtered images with added noise displays a significantly improved FSC curve compared with the other two noise-added data sets. To test if the improved resolution with exposure filtering is due to the improved alignment of the images, we also calculated reconstructions from the noise-added data sets with total exposures of 12.6 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, 19.6 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> using the alignment parameters obtained from the exposure-filtered data. As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, this parameter replacement increases the resolution for the two unfiltered reconstructions to that of the filtered reconstruction, similar to the results obtained for the original data sets in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>. The superior resolution of the exposure-filtered reconstruction is therefore due to more accurate particle alignments. High-quality data sets of smaller particles (about 300 kDa or less) collected using 50 to 100 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> exposures are currently not available to demonstrate the improved particle alignment more directly with experimental data. However, the alignment accuracy of these particles is expected to be limited by weaker contrast (<a href=\"#bib19\">Henderson, 1995</a>), and we expect improvements similar to those seen in our simulation when using exposures that significantly exceed the optimal exposure and applying the exposure filter described here."

As discussed earlier, the other major source of frame-dependent signal change is motion of the specimen, which tends to degrade the signal of earlier frames. For optimal filtering of the data, movement should also be included in the filtering, as should any other effects that change the relative signal in different frames. Currently, the exposure filter does not take movement into account and so will not filter the initial frames optimally. We plan to incorporate movement in a future version of the algorithm."

This methodology uses the data set itself to estimate per frame weights based on fitting relative B-factors to reconstructions from individual frames. Although this is an elegant solution, which in the best case handles weighting of both radiation damage and movement, filtering with the exposure curve described in this paper should offer a number of advantages, at least in terms of filtering radiation damage. First, our filter can be applied at the beginning of processing without assessing the data, and thus, can help in the initial steps of picking particles and finding initial alignment and orientation parameters. Indeed, one could use the two methods in combination, by using the exposure filter described here for the initial refinement, then when a good quality reconstruction has been obtained, using frame filtering based directly on the data. Second, for some data, the estimate for the B-factor to be applied to each frame may be quite noisy and may lead to error, a problem, which is likely to be exacerbated with smaller data sets. Furthermore, accurate estimation of the B-factor relies on high-frequency signal and will thus fail on intermediate- and low-resolution structures. Third, even in situations in which a B-factor can be estimated, it is unclear how well a B-factor estimated using a specific resolution range will describe signal degradation due to radiation damage outside that range. In contrast, our calculated optimal exposure curve describes experimentally determined values at a wide range of resolutions. The tests carried out with the previously published 20S proteasome data (see above) show that the filtering is indeed close to optimal, not only for rotavirus DLP but also for smaller and less symmetrical particles, and that its performance matches that of B-factor weighting. Finally, exposure filtering can also be applied when B-factors are difficult to determine, such as in electron tomography. Using the filter described here, images collected at different specimen tilts can be filtered to optimize the final SNR and resolution in a tomogram. While a similar filtering could also be achieved using B-factors, the relatively low resolution of a tomogram and the presence of structural heterogeneity would likely prevent the determination of appropriate B-factors."

By using a considerably larger total exposure, the SNR of the images at intermediate and low resolutions will be increased, leading to greater accuracy in particle alignment and orientation determination in cases where the accuracy is limited by the signal, which will in turn lead to better reconstructions. This should especially be true for smaller particles where alignment errors can severely limit the attainable resolution (<a href=\"#bib20\">Henderson et al., 2011</a>)."

Furthermore, disconnected density was removed from the display (command \u2018hide dust\u2019 in Chimera) in maps shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A, 6</a> (except for the first panel), and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>."

As a further validation, the resulting model was converted into a density map using the UCSF Chimera package (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>) specifying 2.5 \u00c5 resolution, and an FSC curve between this density map and the optimum reconstruction was calculated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The resolution as determined by the 0.5 cut-off (<a href=\"#bib30\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>) was 2.72 \u00c5."

Signal-limited particle sums were created as follows. First an area devoid of particles was selected from each movie sum.

This initial model was used as a starting model for all subsequent refinements. Processing for all data sets followed the following procedure. Particles sampled to a 5.3 \u00c5 pixel size were aligned to the initial model using the TIGRIS brute-force alignment program. These initial parameters were then refined using Frealign, starting with a resolution cut-off of 10 \u00c5 and gradually increasing to a resolution cut-off of 5 \u00c5 for the final rounds. For all reconstructions, FSCs were calculated between the Frealign output half maps after first masking with a soft-shaped mask."

The large size of the particles made it possible to analyse individual movie frames, and a 130-frame, 100 e-/\u00c52 data set was used to assess the effects of radiation damage. The authors conclude that optimal doses for EM maps at low and intermediate resolutions are much higher than the 10-20 e-/\u00c52 determined previously using crystalline samples, for example with a pre-exposure of 50 e-/\u00c52 a map at better than 6 \u00c5 resolution could be obtained. The authors speculate that the loss of long-range order in the crystalline samples may have played a role. Making use of the fact that the rotavirus particles can be aligned well from very short exposures (they use the average of 3 frames) they devise a filtering scheme for the data based on the resolution-dependent SNR fall-off as a function of exposure, and show that using this scheme a 2.6 \u00c5 reconstruction can be done from the full 130-frame dataset that is indistinguishable from the best reconstruction using unweighted frames 4-21 only. The dose filtering scheme has been integrated in a new program for frame alignment."

While it is convenient to be able to avoid the tedious manual search, it is a harder sell to justify acquiring 5x the number of frames (all needing storage and processing etc.) to get to the same resolution. The authors are no doubt aware of this\u2014but ought to address it directly in the paper\u2014and thus base the justification for the high dose acquisition and weighting scheme on the proposition that this will have a much more important impact on smaller particles. This could then justify the pain of acquiring many more frames but this remains to be proved. Can the authors use one of the publicly available datasets to prove this proposition (e.g. the raw movie frames and other metadata of the proteasome dataset, which goes to 2.8A resolution, are available on EMPIAR)? If the authors decide this is too much work then the emphasis on this point should be reduced, and the authors should modify the statement that the major impact of the paper is enabling SPEM on smaller particles (as this is not yet shown). Instead, the authors could choose to place more emphasis on the extraordinarily high resolution of the reconstruction that has been achieved here. This might involve including some discussion on how the data was obtained and what methods were used to reach the exceptionally higher resolution."

While it is convenient to be able to avoid the tedious manual search, it is a harder sell to justify acquiring 5x the number of frames (all needing storage and processing etc.) to get to the same resolution. The authors are no doubt aware of this\u2014but ought to address it directly in the paper\u2014and thus base the justification for the high dose acquisition and weighting scheme on the proposition that this will have a much more important impact on smaller particles. This could then justify the pain of acquiring many more frames but this remains to be proved. Can the authors use one of the publicly available datasets to prove this proposition (e.g. the raw movie frames and other metadata of the proteasome dataset, which goes to 2.8A resolution, are available on EMPIAR)? If the authors decide this is too much work then the emphasis on this point should be reduced, and the authors should modify the statement that the major impact of the paper is enabling SPEM on smaller particles (as this is not yet shown). Instead, the authors could choose to place more emphasis on the extraordinarily high resolution of the reconstruction that has been achieved here. This might involve including some discussion on how the data was obtained and what methods were used to reach the exceptionally higher resolution</i>."

In addition, we have applied the exposure filter to the recently published proteasome data as suggested by the reviewers, and we also tested its performance in a situation where the alignment accuracy is significantly limited by the strength of the signal present in the images. For the latter, we added to the proteasome images background noise that was extracted from the proteasome micrographs. The resulting images should therefore resemble particle images with about half of the original SNR, similar to what would be expected from a smaller particle of between 175 \u2013 350 kDa mass. In this test, the reconstruction calculated from the exposure-filtered images (with appropriate ice background added) exhibit a significantly higher resolution than reconstructions of non-filtered images with added ice background. We show that the resolution difference is due to different accuracies in the alignment. We describe the results in two new sections: \u201cApplication of the exposure filter to 20S proteasome\u201d and \u201cImproved alignment when signal is limiting\u201d."

When non-crystalline sample (i.e. single particles) are used, diffraction intensities are replaced by intensities calculated from the Fourier transforms of the images. As explained in <a href=\"#bib18\">Hayward and Glaeser (1979)</a>, the fading intensities reduce the SNR present in the affected diffraction spots. The same will be true for the intensities derived from the image Fourier transforms. The SNR is defined as the ratio of the intensity of the spot/squared Fourier amplitude (signal) and variance (noise) of the intensity due to the stochastic events of incident electrons forming the diffraction pattern/image. The magnitude of the intensity variance is determined by the number of electrons contributing to an exposure. When the exposure is evenly divided into frames of a movie as described here, each frame receives the same number of electrons and therefore, the variance of the intensities will remain constant from frame to frame. The fading of intensities is therefore directly proportional to the reduction of SNR. As explained in the manuscript, instead of following the intensities in Fourier transforms, the SNR can also be calculated from the FSC, making it equivalent to the measurement of fading diffraction intensities. We have added additional justification to the manuscript (Introduction section)."

Larger objects will be more strongly affected by small distortions as these can add up across large distances to large shifts of subunits. We have now added a discussion of differences between rotavirus DLP and crystals, including how likely either sample is affected by long-range disorder.
