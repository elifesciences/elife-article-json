Here, we used next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to produce a quantitative, whole genome characterization of gene expression for the major excitatory neuronal classes of the hippocampus; namely, granule cells and mossy cells of the dentate gyrus, and pyramidal cells of areas CA3, CA2, and CA1. Moreover, for the canonical cell classes of the trisynaptic loop, we profiled transcriptomes at both dorsal and ventral poles, producing a cell-class- and region-specific transcriptional description for these populations. This dataset clarifies the transcriptional properties and identities of lesser-known cell classes, and moreover reveals unexpected variation in the trisynaptic loop across the dorsal-ventral axis. We have created a public resource, Hipposeq (<a href=\"http://hipposeq.janelia.org\">http://hipposeq.janelia.org</a>), which provides analysis and visualization of these data and will act as a roadmap relating molecules to cells, circuits, and computation in the hippocampus."

Here, we used next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to produce a quantitative, whole genome characterization of gene expression for the major excitatory neuronal classes of the hippocampus; namely, granule cells and mossy cells of the dentate gyrus, and pyramidal cells of areas CA3, CA2, and CA1. Moreover, for the canonical cell classes of the trisynaptic loop, we profiled transcriptomes at both dorsal and ventral poles, producing a cell-class- and region-specific transcriptional description for these populations. This dataset clarifies the transcriptional properties and identities of lesser-known cell classes, and moreover reveals unexpected variation in the trisynaptic loop across the dorsal-ventral axis. We have created a public resource, Hipposeq (<a href=\"http://hipposeq.janelia.org\">http://hipposeq.janelia.org</a>), which provides analysis and visualization of these data and will act as a roadmap relating molecules to cells, circuits, and computation in the hippocampus."

For example, by relating the specific enriched or depleted genes to their corresponding ontologies in a given population, functional hypotheses can be generated at the intrinsic level (e.g., voltage-gated channel subunits) and network level (e.g., ligand-receptor interactions). A different approach, agnostic to functional correlates of genes, can be taken by using gene expression profiles as a means to genetically delineate different populations of cells, either across classes or within a given class. In this way, gene expression profiling simultaneously clarifies complementary aspects of molecular, cellular, and circuit properties of cells."

Previous work (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</a>) has suggested that domains specified by the dorsal marker gene <i>Lct</i> and the ventral marker <i>Trhr</i> may correspond to tripartite molecular divisions of the dentate gyrus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>): here, <i>Lct</i> and <i>Trhr</i> expression respectively represent the dorsal and ventral divisions, whereas the intermediate domain is characterized by weak expression of both genes.

Examining the spatial patterns of gene expression in the MEC in sagittal sections, we found that these regional-specific genes exhibited a broad range of expression profiles across the dorsal-ventral axis, attenuating in labeling density and/or intensity on a gene-by-gene basis (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Interestingly, although by definition the genes present within a given module were not shared across modules, many associated ontologies and pathways were common between modules. For example, the KEGG annotation 'Long Term Potentiation' was enriched for distinct modules associated with DG granule cells, CA1 pyramidal cells, and CA2/3 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>), illustrating that specific genes that underlie LTP vary between cell classes despite all cell classes expressing genes related to LTP. Similarly, this approach also enabled us to identify specific modules with disease annotations; for example, both mossy cells and dorsal dentate gyrus granule cells were enriched for genes associated with disease terms (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a>)."

For example, the greatly expanded number of marker genes fosters predictions for the role of genes and cell classes in physiology and disease, the complement of RNA-seq and ISH reveals the spatial relationships within and across cell classes of the hippocampus, and the dorsal versus ventral profiling demonstrates the surprising finding that gene expression can be regionally enriched invariant to distinct cell classes.

Our profiling recapitulated many marker genes known <i>a priori</i>, but in addition, demonstrated an abundance of previously unappreciated marker genes. Consequently, our work greatly expands the total number of marker genes and enables several complementary lines of inquiry based upon these findings. First, the marker genes uncovered here serve as candidates for obtaining genetic access to well-defined populations of neurons. Due to the inherently quantitative nature of RNA-seq, the strength and specificity of candidate genes can be evaluated by examining expression in both on-target and off-target populations; promoters associated with genes that are sufficiently restricted in expression can be employed for designing transgenic animals or viruses to enable genetic access. We emphasize that the Cre lines used here for labeling cells for transcriptional profiling (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) may already provide sufficient genetic access to many excitatory subpopulations of the hippocampus; thus, this work offers both existing and new ways to selectively target and manipulate specific populations of neurons. Second, many of the marker genes identified here can be tied to specific functionality (e.g., <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4b</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>), allowing novel marker genes to be used for hypothesis generation. These hypotheses can be investigated through a variety of perturbations (e.g., siRNA, knockouts, or CRISPR-Cas gene editing) combined with other experiments (e.g., physiology, behavior). Similarly, many marker genes identified here are annotated as specific disease-related genes (e.g., <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b,d</a>), which can help to reveal both the molecules and cell classes to examine in pathological conditions and disease models."

On a gene-by-gene basis, these two organizational principles could be observed either individually or simultaneously (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Transcriptional differences across classes of the trisynaptic loop have been identified and appreciated for some time (e.g., <a href=\"#bib13\">Greene et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lein et al., 2004</a>). Indeed, it is likely that these transcriptional differences are fundamental in producing across-class variability in morphology, physiology, and connectivity, ultimately underlying the diverse and distinct roles that the different cell classes are believed to play in hippocampal processing (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mizuseki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2014</a>). Across-region differences, at a cell-class-specific level, have recently been identified to be present in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cell populations (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cembrowski et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Thompson et al., 2008</a>). Here, we show that granule cells of the dentate gyrus also adhere to this rule, with marked differences present in the transcriptomes between dorsal and ventral poles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b,c</a>). Indeed, the transcriptional distance between dorsal and ventral granule cells is similar to that between different populations of cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), a finding similar to that found between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cembrowski et al., 2016</a>)."

Second, our population-level approach may miss heterogeneity that is present at a subpopulation or single-cell level, including transcriptional signatures associated with specialized but sparse excitatory cell classes (e.g., radiatum giant cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gulyas et al., 1998</a>), semilunar granule cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Williams et al., 2007</a>), and CA3 granule cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Szabadics et al., 2010</a>)).

This website and associated dataset expand upon and complement other existing publicly available gene expression databases, mostly notably the ABA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lein et al., 2007</a>). Our RNA-seq approach offers advantages that circumvent traditional issues associated with ISH; namely, providing class-specific data with a large dynamic range, helping to circumvent confounds associated with image-based analyses of gene expression that can be limited by changes in cell density and/or labeling across sections. Of course, RNA-seq also has limitations relative to ISH, including an inherent lack of spatial information. In this way, the combination of Hipposeq and the ABA ISH atlas provides a powerful set of tools that enables quantitative and histological whole genome insight into gene expression in the hippocampus."
