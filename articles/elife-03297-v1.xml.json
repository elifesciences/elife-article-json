In this study, we show a novel function for <i>NDE1</i>, whose mutations cause brain developmental disorders, in safeguarding the genome through S phase during early steps of neural progenitor fate restrictive differentiation. Nde1 mutant neural progenitors showed catastrophic DNA double strand breaks concurrent with the DNA replication. This evoked DNA damage responses, led to the activation of p53-dependent apoptosis, and resulted in the reduction of neurons in cortical layer II/III. We discovered a nuclear pool of Nde1, identified the interaction of Nde1 with cohesin and its associated chromatin remodeler, and showed that stalled DNA replication in Nde1 mutants specifically occurred in mid-late S phase at heterochromatin domains. These findings suggest that NDE1-mediated heterochromatin replication is indispensible for neuronal differentiation, and that the loss of NDE1 function may lead to genomic neurological disorders."

The precise control of the DNA synthesis (S) phase of each cell division cycle warrants the faithful replication of the entire genome and at the same time establishes the epigenetic state that defines the differentiation identity of individual cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">McNairn and Gilbert, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nordman and Orr-Weaver, 2012</a>). Concurrent with genome duplication, the protein components of chromatin are disassembled and re-assembled throughout the S phase into higher order structures that characterize the specific gene expression status of daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alabert and Groth, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Budhavarapu et al., 2013</a>). The task of assuring error-free S phases is especially challenging in the generation of organs with extraordinarily high cell number and diversity, such as the cerebral cortex, during which billions of functionally specialized neurons are produced following a tightly controlled developmental program of cell cycle progression and step-wise neural progenitor fate restriction (<a href=\"#bib74\">Rakic, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Desai and McConnell, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Rakic, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Florio and Huttner, 2014</a>). S phase-mediated genome regulation is recently shown to be essential not only for rapid expansion of neural progenitor pool but also for neural differentiation, as the amount of time neural progenitors spend in S phase is highly correlated to the cell fate of cerebral cortical neural progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arai et al., 2011</a>). Longer S phase appears more necessary for self renewing than neuron-producing cell cycles, suggesting an S phase specific quality control in maintaining the identity of neural progenitors before their terminal neurogenic division. The importance of genome maintenance in corticogenesis is also underscored by large amounts of clinical and experimental observation, which have shown that the functional impairment of genes important for DNA metabolism frequently leads to brain developmental pathology (<a href=\"#bib55\">McKinnon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</a>). However, as the genes involved are also essential for genome surveillance outside of the brain, pathogenic lesions of the brain genome have been believed to associate with the lack of effective DNA damage repair, improper checkpoint signaling, rapid cell proliferation, or increased metabolic, chemical, and physical stresses. It is unclear whether a genome quality control associated specifically with neuronal differentiation is required to ensure the correct genetic and epigenetic identity of both neural progenitors and daughter neurons."

It was originally identified as the central nervous system (CNS) specific partner of LIS1 (known as PAFAH1B1) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Feng et al., 2000</a>), whose haploinsufficiency results in lissencephaly (smooth brain) (<a href=\"#bib77\">Reiner et al., 1993</a>). Homozygous mutations of <i>NDE1</i> were found recently to cause microlissencephaly (small and smooth brain) with up to 90% reduction in brain mass, while the affected individuals showed normal development of non-CNS organs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alkuraya et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bakircioglu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Guven et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, copy number variants (CNVs) in the <i>NDE1</i> locus are increasingly shown to associate with a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders with complex genetic traits (<a href=\"#bib89\">Ullmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hannes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Heinzen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mefford et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Nagamani et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Tropeano et al., 2013</a>). Genetic epistasis studies in mice demonstrated that Nde1 and Lis1 function synergistically in a dose-dependent manner in governing the generation of late-born cortical neurons that comprise the upper cortical layers II and III. Layer II/III neurons were found specifically reduced in both Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> and Nde1<sup>+/\u2212</sup> Lis1<sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice, and they were abolished almost completely in Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Lis1<sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice along with severe brain hypoplasia but insignificant change in the body size (<a href=\"#bib25\">Feng and Walsh, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Pawlisz et al., 2008</a>). Neurons in cortical upper layers are evolutionarily novel and undergo great expansion in mammalian evolution (<a href=\"#bib16\">DeFelipe et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Molnar et al., 2006</a>). They are highly diverse projection neurons and essential for cognitive functions including perception, emotion, attention, and memory through making functional connections among various cortical areas and between the two cerebral hemispheres (<a href=\"#bib16\">DeFelipe et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fame et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Greig et al., 2013</a>). The essential requirement of Nde1 in the generation of cortical layer II/III neurons underscores the gene dosage dependency of <i>NDE1</i> in brain cognition. However, current molecular information on NDE1 (Nde1) is limited by its previously identified association with the cytoskeleton, which does not fully explain its CNS specific phenotype and function."

The most profound phenotype that resulted from Nde1 mutations was severe DNA damage that occurred during mid to late S phase heterochromatic DNA replication. Stalled DNA replication led to DNA replicative catastrophe and the activation of tumor suppressor p53 (encoded by Trp53 or Tp53) via DNA damage responses (DDRs). Abrogating p53-suppressed apoptosis rescued the size and structure of Nde1 mutant brain but failed to mitigate the genomic stress. We also identified a nuclear pool of Nde1 and the interaction of Nde1 with the cohesin complex as well as the chromatin remodeler SNF2h. These findings suggest that Nde1 is essential for CNS specific genomic quality control, that chromatin remodeling during heterochromatic replication facilitated by Nde1 is essential for generating cortical layer II/III neurons, and that reduced fidelity of S phase choreography during the early phase of neural progenitor differentiation and identity establishment may lead to mosaic genomic lesions and developmental brain disorders."

However, massive apoptosis detected by TUNEL was also observed predominantly in the newly formed cortical plate (CP) of Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Lis1<sup>+/\u2212</sup> embryos at E12.5 (<a href=\"#bib67\">Pawlisz et al., 2008</a>). To understand the mechanism of apoptosis and evaluate its contribution to the loss of layer II/III neurons in Nde1 mutant brains, we examined its associated cellular processes and found that the apoptosis in both Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Lis1<sup>+/\u2212</sup> and Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mutants corresponded with increased DNA damage. A substantial number of cells in the neocortex of Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Lis1<sup>+/\u2212</sup> and Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mutants showed abnormally high \u03b3H2AX immunosignals, a hallmark for DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) (<a href=\"#bib87\">Thiriet and Hayes, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). While \u03b3H2AX foci associated with DNA replication were also widely detected in wild-type and mutant cortices, the \u03b3H2AX+ signals observed in the mutant were several orders of magnitude higher, showed pan-nuclear pattern, and were often co-stained by antibodies to cleaved caspase 3 (CC3), the marker for apoptosis. While apoptosis was wide-spread and observed in both CP neurons and ventricular zone (VZ) neural progenitors (<a href=\"#bib67\">Pawlisz et al., 2008</a>), \u03b3H2AX+ cells were confined in the VZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This suggested that DNA damage occurred prior to apoptosis and that apoptosis was one of the endpoints of DNA damage caused by Nde1 deficiency."

                                "text": "The DNA damage and apoptosis in Nde1 mutant brain were found to correlate spatiotemporally with the early fate restrictive differentiation of neural progenitors. In the Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Lis1<sup>+/\u2212</sup> brain, \u03b3H2AX+ and CC3+ cells were detected as early as the onset of neocortical neurogenesis at E10.5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). At this stage, a majority of the neural progenitors progress through the cell cycle rapidly to expand the progenitor pool, while some start to differentiate into intermediate neural progenitors or neurons. From E10.5 to E12.5, as more neural progenitors become fate restricted, both DNA damage and apoptosis in the Nde1 mutant cortex increased and peaked at E12.5. With the progression of cortical neurogenesis, \u03b3H2AX+ and CC3+ cells declined gradually after E13.5 when more cortical neurons were produced. Apoptosis in both Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Lis1<sup>+/\u2212</sup> and Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mutants became lower during the later stages of cortical neurogenesis after E15, even though a majority of cortical layer II/III neurons are generated through terminal mitosis between E15 and E17. In contrast to the low level of apoptosis, \u03b3H2AX+ cells remained detectable until birth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While \u03b3H2AX and CC3 signals were at peak levels in the neocortex of Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Lis1<sup>+/\u2212</sup> and Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> brains at E12.5, they were absent in the mutant cortical hem, the highly proliferating but non-neurogenic hippocampus organizer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This suggested that DNA damage and apoptosis caused by Nde1 mutation were associated with neural progenitor differentiation as opposed to proliferation. During neocortical development, neurogenesis is known to proceed along the transverse neurogenic gradient (TNG), which initiates rostrolaterally and propagates caudomedially (<a href=\"#bib13\">Caviness et al., 2009</a>). To better reveal the correlation of DNA damage and apoptosis with neocortical neurogenesis, we examined serially sectioned Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> brains (n = 6) by double immunostaining of \u03b3H2AX and CC3 with newborn neuron markers DCX or Tuj1. Compared to Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Lis1<sup>+/\u2212</sup> brains, the well-preserved cytoarchitecture of Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> brains allows for a better assessment of the spatial distribution of DNA damage and apoptosis with respect to the TNG. At earlier E12, more \u03b3H2AX+ cells were observed in the rostrolateral than the caudomedial neocortex. Similarly, CC3+ cells were predominantly detected rostrolaterally in these brains. Towards later E12, as TNG progresses caudomedially, CC3+ cells also increased in the caudolateral and rostromedial cortical regions. In all cortical sections examined, \u03b3H2AX+ and CC3 signals were correlated spatially with the presence and abundance of newborn neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Together, these data demonstrated that DNA damage and apoptosis in Nde1 mutant cortices had little correlation with self-renewal proliferation or neurogenic terminal divisions but was well in line with early neural progenitor fate restrictive differentiation around E12.5 in the developing neocortex."

These developmental analyses demonstrate that the most profound phenotype caused by Nde1 mutations is characterized by DNA damage and apoptosis, and that this phenotype is spatiotemporally in parallel to the early differentiation period of neural progenitors. Thus, the indispensible role of Nde1 in generating layer II/III neurons appears to be at the time when the fate of these neurons is initially established rather than when they are generated through terminal mitosis."

Many mutant cells showed elevated \u03b3H2AX and p-p53S18 but lacked DNA condensation and fragmentation, supporting that \u03b3H2AX and p53 activation in Nde1 mutants occurred prior to the programmed cell death (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We found that the level of p53 S18 hyper-phosphorylation correlated to Nde1 gene dosage as well as to the degree of brain malformations caused by Nde1 mutations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Similarly, the loss of Nde1 resulted in an elevated basal level of p53, which is known to be low in healthy cells, supporting the DDR-mediated p53 activation. These results indicate that Nde1 mutation primarily results in DNA damage, and apoptosis is caused by DDR with p53 activation. Thus, in contrast to the prevailing view of Nde1 being a cytoskeletal regulator, these data revealed a novel function of Nde1 in protecting the genome."

Furthermore, we also noticed that in both Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Lis1<sup>+/\u2212</sup> and Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mutants, many nuclei that stopped incorporating BrdU (IdU+BrdU\u2212) remained in the S phase zone of the basal VZ instead of descending apically as seen in the wild-type progenitors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, white arrows). Neural progenitors in the cortical VZ are polarized apical-basally and known to undergo interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) by moving their nuclei basally during S phase. After S phase is completed, the nuclei are moved apically for mitosis to occur at the ventricular surface (<a href=\"#bib85\">Takahashi et al., 1993</a>). As the basally localized IdU+BrdU\u2212 nuclei in the mutant were not recognized in G2/M by PH3 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), it suggested that these mutant cells might arrest in the basal S phase zone due to the stalled DNA replication. To confirm the faulty S phase prior to G2/M, we increased the time between IdU and BrdU pulses to 2.5 hr to observe if the IdU+BrdU\u2212 cells in the basal S phase zone of the mutant may progress to mitosis over time. However, we observed that rather than progressing to mitosis, these cells remained stalled and that about half (47.5%) of the \u03b3H2AX+ cells were positively stained by antibodies to IdU but not to BrdU, indicating that S phase-stalled cells underwent DDR by activating \u03b3H2AX (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). This explains why only 20% of \u03b3H2AX+ cells were actively incorporating BrdU (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), since a majority of \u03b3H2AX+ cells were stalled in the S phase. Therefore, our data demonstrate that Nde1 is functionally essential during S phase and that DNA damage in Nde1 mutant progenitors results from stalled and catastrophic DNA replication."

To better understand the function of Nde1 in S phase, we studied the dynamic progression of S phase and analyzed IdU and CldU sequentially labeled chromosomal domains by taking advantage of the non-overlapping immunosignals between IdU and CldU. Embryos were pulse labeled by IdU for 1.5 hr before being labeled again by CldU transiently. Cells in early S phase were identified by CldU but not IdU incorporation (IdU\u2212CldU+) as well as a more evenly distributed CldU immunosignals, as new replication foci emerge continuously throughout the transcriptionally active euchromatin. Whereas cells in mid to late S phase were labeled by both IdU and CldU (IdU+CldU+) and recognized by enhanced nucleotide incorporation in various transcriptionally silent heterochromatic domains. Cells that had left S phase could be noted by IdU+ only (IdU+CldU\u2212) immunosignals, since they stopped nucleotide incorporation before CldU pulse labeling. By quantitative comparison of IdU-CldU labeled progenitors in the cortical VZ of wild-type and Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mutant, we failed to detect a significant difference in the early S phase population but found more mutant progenitors in mid to late S phase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In a large number of Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> progenitors, CldU signals in IdU+CldU+ cells were predominantly detected along the nuclear periphery, the rim of nucleoli, and on particles of satellite repeats which are characteristic for heterochromatic domains, indicating replication difficulties in these domains during mid to late S phase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). Triple immunostaining of IdU, CldU, and PH3 allowed us to access the S to G2/M progression; we found that Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> progenitors showed a reduction in the intensity and the number of IdU labeled foci in PH3+ cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, arrows), suggesting reduced nucleotide incorporation into mutant progenitors before S phase completion. Collectively, the unaltered early S phase population, significant increase in CldU labeling in various heterochromatic domains, reduced IdU labeling in PH3+ cells, combined with prolonged duration of S phase, suggest that DNA replication in Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> progenitors progresses normally through the euchromatin, but stalls during heterochromatin replication in mid-late S phase."

In this case, the restored size and structure of Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> brain by p53 abrogation is not expected to show genome rescue even though DDR-induced apoptosis was suppressed. This would also suggest that genomic lesions incurred during development could be structurally tolerated and not necessarily manifest in changed brain anatomy. To test this hypothesis, we measured the Ts of Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Trp53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> progenitors and found the lengthened Ts in Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> progenitors was not mitigated by p53 removal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

As somatically generated chromosomal aberrations can happen in neocortical progenitors and neurons of the normal brain (<a href=\"#bib76\">Rehen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bushman and Chun, 2013</a>), and Nde1 mutation affects only selected cells in a heterogeneous pool of neural progenitors, such genomic mosaicism and cell heterogeneity of the developing cortex precluded us from obtaining direct information on the genomic lesions in the Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Trp53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> brain. Instead, we looked into further evidence of DNA damage by examining cell cycle stress in Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Trp53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> embryonic cortices. After completing S phase, neural progenitors of the VZ normally move replicated chromosomes through INM towards the apical ventricular surface where chromosome condensation and mitosis occur. In both Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> and Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Trp53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cortices, a substantial number of PH3+ progenitors were found mislocalized basally (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). PH3 is an indicator of cells in both late-G2 and M phases; we found chromosomes of the mislocalized PH3+ mutant progenitors were not condensed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a> higher magnification views), indicating cell cycle arrest in G2 instead of M phase. The G2 arrest in Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> and Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Trp53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> progenitors was confirmed by co-immunostaining PH3+ cells with the phospho-vimentin antibody 4A4, which exclusively recognizes progenitors in M phase (<a href=\"#bib91\">Weissman et al., 2003</a>). Most PH3+4A4+ progenitors in Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> and Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Trp53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mutants were correctly localized at the ventricular surface, whereas most PH3+4A4\u2212 progenitors in the mutants were ectopically localized, indicating that the basally mislocalized PH3+ cells were those arrested in late-G2 and that INM in the mutant was largely normal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

The hallmark for DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint involves the degradation of Cdc25A, a phosphatase essential for Cdk1 activation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mailand et al., 2000</a>). Both Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> and Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Trp53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> brains showed reduced levels of Cdc25A at E12.5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), supporting the notion that prolonged G2 in Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Trp53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> progenitors was a result of persistent DNA damage."

Nde1 is a dynamic scaffold regulated by cell cycle dependent post-translational modifications, and it is capable of participating in various cellular compartments (<a href=\"#bib25\">Feng and Walsh, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Stehman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Pawlisz and Feng, 2011</a>). By varying conditions of immunodetection, we found Nde1 was localized in the nucleus of a subset of primary progenitors identified by Pax6 immunoreactivity in the neocortical VZ at E12.5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The possible nuclear targeting of Nde1 was confirmed by transfecting and examining GFP-tagged Nde1 in HeLa cells using confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Furthermore, co-immunostaining of Nde1 and Pcna, a DNA polymerase accessory factor which marks the replication fork with a distinctive punctate pattern, indicated that the nuclear pool of Nde1 was elevated when the progenitors were undergoing DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), which suggested that Nde1 may translocate into the nucleus during S phase to play a direct role in DNA replication."

Smc3 is a core subunit of cohesin, an essential guardian of genome integrity. Composed of SMC1, SMC3, SCC1 (RAD21), and SCC3 (STAG), cohesin forms a ring-like structure to embrace chromatin fibers from the moment they arise following the replication fork until the onset of anaphase to ensure the proper segregation of genetic materials to daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nasmyth, 2011</a>). The physical interaction of Nde1 and Smc3 was confirmed by the co-immunoprecipiation studies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Two other core subunits of the cohesin complex, Smc1 and Rad21, were also detected in the Nde1\u2013Smc3 immunocomplex, indicating the direct interaction of Nde1 with the entire cohesin complex. We also performed the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation analysis to detect Nde1 in the immunoprecipitate of the SMC3 fragment recovered from the Nde1 yeast two-hybrid screen. This Nde1 binding domain of Smc3 (NBD), which corresponds to amino acids R746 to R903 in the coiled-coil region between the C-terminal globular and central hinge domains of Smc3, was immunoprecipitated and found to form a specific immunocomplex with Nde1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). To determine the functional significance of the Nde1\u2013Smc3 interaction, we over-expressed the NBD to block the binding of Nde1 with cohesin and found that NBD arrested the cell cycle preferentially in S phase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). We also noted that many cells expressing the NBD showed fragmented nuclei or committed to apoptosis as seen in Nde1 mutant neural progenitors (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data suggested that the lack of proper interaction of Nde1 with cohesin may underlie the S phase genotoxicity in Nde1 mutant neural progenitors."

Cohesin can also serve as a platform for DSB repair or act as a nuclear global controller for gene expression on both transcriptional and epigenetic levels. The diverse functions of cohesin are accomplished through recruiting various molecules to the core cohesin ring complex (<a href=\"#bib69\">Peters et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Imakaev et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Baranello et al., 2014</a>).

The chromatin remodeler SNF2h was consistently found in the Nde1\u2013cohesin immunoprecipitates (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). SNF2h is an ATPase chromatin remodeler that interacts with RAD21 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hakimi et al., 2002</a>). During S phase, SNF2h is recruited to the replication foci and facilitates heterochromatic remodeling (<a href=\"#bib94\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Guetg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Sugimoto et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Postepska-Igielska et al., 2013</a>).

                                "text": "One of the most important observations presented in this study is that DNA damage and apoptosis in Nde1 mutant brain were spatially and temporally associated with the early neuronal differentiation of multipotent neural progenitors. The peak detection of \u03b3H2AX and CC3 in the developing cortex of Nde1 mutant mice was around E12.5. Levels of DNA damage and apoptosis were low, both during the early phase neural progenitor self renewal before E12 and when the bulk of cortical neurons were generated after E15. During the period when genomic lesions were detected at the peak level between E12 and E13, their abundance spatially correlated with the level of neurogenesis following the TNG. According to a recent genetic fate mapping study, at least a subset of progenitors become fate restricted to become upper layer cortical neurons before E13.5, even through these neurons are generated through terminal mitosis 3\u20134 days later (<a href=\"#bib27\">Franco et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, the temporal-specific DNA damage that we observed in the Nde1 mutant brain matches closely with the time when primary neural progenitors become fate restricted to be layer II/III neurons. This phenotype is different from what have been seen in conditional brain mutation of genes known to play global roles in DNA metabolism and genome surveillance, such as Brca1, ATR, DNA ligase IV, XRCC4, TopBP1, and Cdh1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Frank et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gao et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Pulvers and Huttner, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gatz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Eguren et al., 2013</a>). In these mutants, endogenous or gamma irradiation-induced DNA damage and p53-dependent apoptosis were shown to occur non-selectively in all progenitors that undergo active proliferation; abrogating p53 ameliorated the microcephaly but made little improvement to the structure of the mutant brain, which agree well with the wide-spread loss-of-function defects of these genes in many other organs. These previous studies demonstrated the importance of genome maintenance in brain development but did not reveal the brain specific endogenous origins of DNA damage and its underlying molecular mechanisms. In contrast, experimental findings of this study not only identified Nde1 as a key player for brain specific genome maintenance but also highlighted the principal source of DNA damage in brain development. Our data suggest that the strongest demand for genomic surveillance occurs in S phase and at heterochromatic DNA domains when neural progenitors undergo fate restrictive differentiation."

Compared to the actively transcribed euchromatin, heterochromatin is densely packed and traditionally considered transcriptionally inert. However, heterochromatin is known to produce RNA transcripts necessary for the establishment of heterochromatic states (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bierhoff et al., 2014</a>), and these RNA transcripts were preferentially generated during the replication of the heterochromatin in late S phase (<a href=\"#bib48\">Li et al., 2011</a>). Heterochromatin may not only influence gene expression profiles through regulating the higher-order chromatin structure, the repetitive sequences of heterochromatin are also hotspots for recombination which represent serious challenges to genomic integrity (<a href=\"#bib68\">Peng and Karpen, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Almouzni and Probst, 2011</a>). The proper maintenance of heterochromatin following the replication fork is indispensible for genomic stability by suppressing recombination and somatic mutations. The newly identified Nde1 partners cohesin and SNF2h are both known to participate in heterochromatin formation and function in multiple tissues. Therefore, further delineating the genomic target specifically co-regulated by Nde1and cohesin complex in neural progenitors will provide critical insight into how genomic quality is specifically controlled during neuronal differentiation."

While the lengthened G1 may permit increased gene expression and protein synthesis required for neurogenesis, another important task of G1 is to determine the timing of DNA replication and \u2018license\u2019 the replication origins through loading pre-replication complexes of DNA helicase at various chromosomal domains (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dimitrova and Gilbert, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gilbert, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nordman and Orr-Weaver, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Renard-Guillet et al., 2014</a>). In mammalian cells, over 30,000 origins are unutilized in each cell cycle; the spatiotemporal pattern of replication origin activation may depend on, as well as determine, a cell's differentiation state (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gilbert, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nordman and Orr-Weaver, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Rhind and Gilbert, 2013</a>). As the peak of S phase defect in Nde1 mutants at E12 to E13 overlaps with the developmental period, when Ts is at the top value and TG1 increased most drastically (<a href=\"#bib86\">Takahashi et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Miyama et al., 1997</a>), it is not unreasonable to speculate that the early phase of neuronal fate determination involves the reprogramming of chromatin state that initiates in G1 and executes in S phases. Thus, cell fate in cortical development may not merely be determined by turning on or off a handful of genes, but rather controlled at the genomic level by a nuclear global alteration of the chromatin state."

However, Nde1 is diverged structurally and functionally from its paralog Ndel1 in mammals outside of the coiled-coil and is primarily expressed in neural progenitors and hematopoietic cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Feng et al., 2000</a>). We have found that the native Nde1 protein in the developing mouse tissue is very insoluble and exists at a relatively low level, but genetic studies have shown that Nde1/NDE1 is an essential player for various pivotal aspects of the neural progenitor biology. It is likely that all native Nde1 molecules are fully occupied through binding to other cellular proteins. The multifaceted function of NDE1 as a molecular scaffold might be fulfilled by post-translational modifications or through undergoing reversible transitions between monomeric and polymeric forms (<a href=\"#bib25\">Feng and Walsh, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Soares et al., 2012</a>), which facilitate its dynamic partition and reassembly into different molecular complexes. DNA replication is one of the most challenging processes that requires efficient and accurate molecular re-arrangements. During S phase, thousands of replication origins are utilized in a spatiotemporally defined pattern. At each licensed origin, helicase is loaded, replisome is assembled, nucleosomes are disassembled ahead of each replication fork, and resembled onto the two daughter genomes. Meanwhile, multiple histone chaperones, modification enzymes, and numerous chromatin remodelers are recruited to ensure the precise duplication of both the genome and the epigenome (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alabert and Groth, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Whitehouse and Smith, 2013</a>). Such a dynamic process requires a protein(s) like NDE1 to serve as a versatile platform to facilitate various protein\u2013protein interactions. Thus, an evolutionarily advanced dynamic scaffold function during heterochromatin replication is consistent with a functional involvement of Nde1 in neural progenitor biology."

However, it is unclear how such regulation could underlie the tissue specific and spatiotemporally dependent phenotype of both human and mouse NDE1/Nde1 mutations nor the DNA replication defects described in this study. Our data suggest that instead Nde1 may be involved in assisting ATP-utilizing chromatin remodeling proteins such as SNF2h to move and reorganize nucleosomes along the DNA strand during heterochromatin replication. Replication forks in Nde1 mutant neural progenitors are paused or stalled at heterochromatic domains composed of centric/pericentric repeats. The integrity of centric/pericentric heterochromatic domains is essential not only for defining the chromatin state but also for the recruitment and the establishment of kinetochore complexes required for mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation in mitosis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ishii et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">DeLuca and Musacchio, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Mankouri et al., 2013</a>). While a direct role of Nde1 in mitotic spindle organization remains plausible, we also believe that the skewed mitosis previously observed in Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> neural progenitors may, at least in part, originate from unresolved centromeric and pericentromeric structural defects arising during S phase. It remains to be further tested whether the mitotic spindle defect observed in Nde1 mutant progenitors is a primary cause for the defective cortical neurogenesis or a consequence of an ill-replicated genome."

                                "text": "The selective expression of Nde1 in neural progenitors and cells of hematopoietic lineage implies specific functional requirement of Nde1 in these cells. It is intriguing that the loss of NDE1 impairs the developing CNS much more profoundly than the hematopoietic system and other non-CNS tissues, though NDE1 mutations are associated with leukemogenesis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cavazzini et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Van der Reijden et al., 2010</a>). In the developing CNS, the role of NDE1 is more essential in humans than in mice. Patients who lose both functional copies of <i>NDE1</i> show severe malformation of many brain structures, but the detectable brain anatomical defect of Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice is largely limited to the neocortex and specifically to layer II/III cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib25\">Feng and Walsh, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alkuraya et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bakircioglu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Guven et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Paciorkowski et al., 2013</a>). While the mild phenotype in many key brain structures, such as the hippocampus, of Nde1 mice may be due to the functional redundancy of Nde1 with Ndel1, the common etiology of NDE1 mutation-induced genotoxicity in both neural and hematopoietic progenitors suggests that NDE1 may be important for establishing the evolutionarily increased cell diversity and function in both brain and blood. The cerebral cortex is the largest organ in terms of both cell number and functional diversity, and cortical layer II/III is expanded exponentially in evolution (<a href=\"#bib16\">DeFelipe et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Molnar et al., 2006</a>). The small and medium-size pyramidal neurons of cortical layer II/III are essential for functional connectivity between two cerebral hemispheres and among various cortical regions; they are essential for evolutionarily advanced higher order brain activities (<a href=\"#bib16\">DeFelipe et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fame et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Greig et al., 2013</a>). It is evident that even a slight perturbation to these neurons is likely to result in cognitive deficits. Therefore, it is conceivable that advanced novel molecular controls are gained in mammalian evolution to protect the genome of these neurons, although further study is required to elucidate the mechanism underlying such genome maintenance. Our data show that genomic damages during neurogenesis are primarily responsible for the cortical neuronal loss in Nde1 mutant brains. However, depending on the activity of DDRs, genomic damages may not necessarily result in altered brain structure as evidenced by the restored structure and layer II/III neurons in the Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Trp53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mutant. We believe that these data highlight the importance of genomic control of neuronal functions. Nde1 mutant cells presented an entire array of genotoxic features including DSBs and chromosomal lesions that would ordinarily lead to carcinogenesis. Nonetheless, even the Nde1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>Trp53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> brain, which presumably carries the unresolved genomic lesions to adulthood, was cancer-free. While the absence of brain tumor may be in line with our observation that genotoxicity in Nde1 mutant neural progenitors occurred when they become fate restricted along the path of differentiation towards post-mitotic neurons, it is still interesting to learn whether cortical neurons can truly forgive the genomic lesions they inherit from their precursors. With the advent of comprehensive genome-wide analysis, somatic mutations, especially copy number variants (CNVs) are found to be specifically abundant in human neurons and increasingly linked to neurodevelopmental diseases (<a href=\"#bib33\">Grayton et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">McConnell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Moreno-De-Luca et al., 2013</a>). The <i>NDE1</i> gene is one of the \u2018hot spots\u2019 for CNVs at chromosome 16p13.11, of which deletions and duplications have been found to associate with a wide spectrum of developmental brain disorders including intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hebebrand et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Gillberg, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Sharp et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Ullmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hannes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Heinzen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mefford et al., 2010</a>). The genomic region span 16p13.11 encodes eight transcripts including MPV17L, C16orf45, KIAA0430, MYH11, C16orf63, ABCC1, and ABCC6 in addition to NDE1. Among these <i>NDE1</i> is the only gene that is known to be important for brain formation. Findings described in this study suggest that <i>NDE1</i> dosage alteration may result in secondary genomic lesions in cortical neurons. Therefore, even with the lack of neoplastic over-proliferation, brain developmental diseases may have a commonality with cancers as genomic mosaic genomic disorders. Although neurons with altered genome do not become cancerous due to their post-mitotic nature, they can be manifested by functional deficits of the brain in various forms. While further studies are required for delineating the causal relationship between <i>NDE1</i> gene dosage and compromised cortical functions, results from this study predict that genomic insults incurred during heterochromatic DNA replication during neural progenitor differentiation may underlie a large variety of developmental neurological and psychiatric disorders."

Briefly, cortical progenitors were isolated in cold PBS with 20 mM EDTA from E12.5 mouse embryos, resuspended in 1% low melting point agar and PBS, and spread onto agar-coated slides. Cells on the slides were incubated in lysis buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris base, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% DMSO) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, followed by alkaline buffer (0.3 N NaOH and 1 mM EDTA) for 20 min at room temperature. After washing three times with 0.5\u00d7 TBE, the cell-coated slides were electrophoresed at 0.7 volt/cm in 0.5\u00d7 TBE, then neutralized, stained with DAPI, and analyzed under fluorescence microscope. Cells from Nde1 mutants and littermate controls were analyzed in parallel under the same experimental conditions, and comet tail length of over 300 randomly selected cells was scored. The assay was performed with more than three litters of Nde1, Lis1 double mutant embryos; results from representative experiments are shown."

Could this be the time of greatest vulnerability, as this is the time when protein synthesis and accumulation in G1 may govern cell fate decisions?

It is conceivable that restored Cux1+ neurons in the Nde1-/-p53-/- cortices may have functional deficits due to unrepaired genomic damage; they may have a different \u201cfate\u201d in terms of the genome or chromatin state.

Showing genomic damage in Nde1-p53 double mutant brains directly has been one of our major efforts during this study. Several attempts have been made including a genome-wide study to identify aneuploidy and other chromosomal aberrations from adult cortical neurons using array-CGH. However, the presence of aneuploidy in wild type progenitors /neurons as well as the high heterogeneity of cortical cells and somatic mutations in Nde1 and Nde1-p53 brains prevented us from identifying consensus mutations. Although FISH can also be used to demonstrate aneuploidy, it requires sequence or chromosome specific DNA probes. Due to the random nature of somatic mutations and the putative involvement of heterochromatic repetitive sequences in the Nde1-p53 double mutant brain, it would be hard to pinpoint specific mutations and reach a statistically significant consensus conclusion with individual or a limited number of FISH probes. Therefore, we showed as clearly as was possible that both Nde1-/- and Nde1-/-;P53-/- progenitors experienced increased cell cycle and genomic stress through S phase, G2, and DDR analyses, and in particular, the increased degradation of Cdc25A (showed in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) is a hallmark of persistent genomic stress."
