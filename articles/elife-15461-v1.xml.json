Yet, little is known regarding the mechanistic basis controlling initial and homeostatic \u2018scaling\u2019 of stem cell pool sizes relative to their target tissues for effective regeneration. Here, we show that TEAD1-expressing skeletal muscle of transgenic mice features a dramatic hyperplasia of muscle stem cells (i.e. satellite cells, SCs) but surprisingly without affecting muscle tissue size. Super-numeral SCs attain a \u2018normal\u2019 quiescent state, accelerate regeneration, and maintain regenerative capacity over several injury-induced regeneration bouts. In dystrophic muscle, the TEAD1 transgene also ameliorated the pathology. We further demonstrate that hyperplastic SCs accumulate non-cell-autonomously via signal(s) from the TEAD1-expressing myofiber, suggesting that myofiber-specific TEAD1 overexpression activates a physiological signaling pathway(s) that determines initial and homeostatic SC pool size. We propose that TEAD1 and its downstream effectors are medically relevant targets for enhancing muscle regeneration and ameliorating muscle pathology."

Yet, little is known regarding the mechanistic basis controlling initial and homeostatic \u2018scaling\u2019 of stem cell pool sizes relative to their target tissues for effective regeneration. Here, we show that TEAD1-expressing skeletal muscle of transgenic mice features a dramatic hyperplasia of muscle stem cells (i.e. satellite cells, SCs) but surprisingly without affecting muscle tissue size. Super-numeral SCs attain a \u2018normal\u2019 quiescent state, accelerate regeneration, and maintain regenerative capacity over several injury-induced regeneration bouts. In dystrophic muscle, the TEAD1 transgene also ameliorated the pathology. We further demonstrate that hyperplastic SCs accumulate non-cell-autonomously via signal(s) from the TEAD1-expressing myofiber, suggesting that myofiber-specific TEAD1 overexpression activates a physiological signaling pathway(s) that determines initial and homeostatic SC pool size. We propose that TEAD1 and its downstream effectors are medically relevant targets for enhancing muscle regeneration and ameliorating muscle pathology."

Muscle also contains a population of muscle stem cells that repair injured tissue. Normally, in adult skeletal muscle, these stems cells are in a resting state. However, upon injury, the stem cells become activated, divide to increase in number and then develop into new muscle fibers to replace those that were damaged. The balance between the number of stem cells and the size of the muscle must be tightly regulated to ensure that there are enough stem cells to fully regenerate the tissue after injury. However, little is known about how tissues keep their number of stem cells in proportion with their overall size."

Further experiments then showed that having more stem cells meant that the muscles were repaired more quickly after an injury. Additionally, when mice with extra Tead1 had a mutation that normally leads to muscle wasting, experiments showed that the progression of the disease was stunted."

Together these findings suggest that a signal from the muscle fiber to its stem cells regulates the size of the stem cell population in the tissue. The next challenge is to uncover the molecule (or molecules) that signals from the muscle fiber to the stem cells and to gain deeper insight into how the Tead1 protein can counteract the effects of a muscle wasting disease."

In the unperturbed state, these reserve cells are maintained at a defined pool size. Upon tissue damage, they expand to give rise to progenitors that can differentiate for efficient and timely tissue restoration as well as self-renew to re-establish the stem cell pool. With age, tissue function and regenerative capacity decline due to alterations in stem cell intrinsic function, microenvironment (niche), and systemic cues. Collectively, these changes lead to a decline in the number of functional stem cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Oh et al., 2014</a>). The skeletal muscle system provides an experimental paradigm for understanding stem cell-based tissue regeneration. Because of the essentiality of skeletal muscles for mobility, metabolic homeostasis, and thermogenesis, the clinical relevance of resident muscle stem cells cannot be over-stated."

The muscle stem cells driving this remarkable lifelong regenerative response are satellite cells (SCs), which were initially discovered by Alexander Mauro in Xenopus (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mauro, 1961</a>). SCs comprise a small population (5 to 7% of all muscle nuclei) of undifferentiated and quiescent mono-nucleated cells that reside between the basal lamina and the surface of skeletal muscle cells; a microenvironment referred to as their niche (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cardasis and Cooper, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mauro, 1961</a>). SCs express the transcription factor Pax7 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Seale et al., 2000</a>). Lineage-tracing experiments unequivocally demonstrate that Pax7-expressing (Pax7<sup>+</sup>) SCs are of somitic origin (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lepper and Fan, 2010</a>), and they are the major contributing source of myonuclei in both postnatal development and injury-induced regeneration (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lepper et al., 2009</a>). Ablation of the Pax7<sup>+</sup> cell population in adult mice establishes that they are essential for muscle regeneration (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lepper et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">McCarthy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Murphy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sambasivan et al., 2011</a>). Pax7<sup>+</sup>\u00a0SCs first appear under the basal lamina at late stages of fetal myogenesis (day 15.5 of gestation in the mouse) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gros et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Relaix et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schienda et al., 2006</a>). After birth, they remain highly active to supply myonuclei for muscle growth but gradually cease to differentiate by 3\u20134 weeks (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lepper et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">White et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, SCs appear to be set-aside as a quiescent pool of stem cells during this time frame for muscle homeostasis and regeneration throughout lifetime."

The primary foci of those studies are regulators for SC proliferation, differentiation, and self-renewal during adult and aged muscle homeostasis and following injury. Information derived from these studies helps formulate strategies towards restoring a functionally competent SC pool to combat muscle aging and muscular dystrophies. By contrast, a significant gap exists in our current knowledge pertaining to the regulation of SCs shortly after birth when they provide myonuclei to drive tissue growth and transition into quiescence, i.e. their initial establishment. In particular, how the initial SC population is proportionally scaled with respect to the muscle size during the postnatal period is entirely unknown. In adult homeostasis, SC numbers per muscle fiber in the mouse (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins et al., 2005</a>) or per defined myofiber length in human (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boldrin and Morgan, 2011</a>) reveal very minimal inter-fiber variation. Teleologically, SC number to muscle size scaling would be most relevant to the replicative potential of SCs per given muscle tissue volume in regeneration. It seems reasonable to presume that the physiological SC/muscle ratio is developmentally set at a maximum in a given muscle group for effective regeneration later on in life. To what extent this ratio can be altered without changing muscle size or impacting regenerative potential remains unclear."

By contrast, a \u2018gain-of-function\u2019 mouse model with super-numeral SCs is much desired, as its molecular dissection would much more likely enable the discovery of the molecular mechanism(s) sufficiently altering the initial SC pool size. Moreover, a robust SC hyperplasia mouse model could allow addressing the relevant clinical question of whether bestowing a tissue with extra stem cells would be of benefit or of detriment to the regenerative process of skeletal muscle and in other organismal systems. Yet, currently it is unknown whether the SC pool can be increased in the absence of overall muscle tissue hypertrophy."

We had generated transgenic mice that express hemagglutin-tagged (HA)-TEAD1 driven by a 6.5\u00a0Kb muscle creatine kinase (MCK) control region (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tsika et al., 2008</a>). TEAD1 belongs to the TEA domain transcription factor family, which serves important functional roles in multiple embryonic contexts by activating gene expression when bound to the Hippo signaling pathway effectors Yap or Taz (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). Muscle-intrinsic changes effected by TEAD1 overexpression include a prominent transition toward a slow muscle contractile phenotype (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tsika et al., 2008</a>). Here, we provide comprehensive analyses of the SC compartment and make the discovery of a robust, up to 6-fold increase of quiescent SCs in TEAD1-Tg mice. As a functional consequence, TEAD1-Tg muscle regenerates at a faster rate post-injury likely owing to their increased SC number as well as the increased proliferation rates observed when the myofiber-associated SCs are activated. Remarkably, in the <i>mdx</i> mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, skeletal muscle pathology is significantly ameliorated by TEAD1-overexpression, which is likely contributed in part by an increase in <i>utrophin</i> expression. Lastly, we provide evidence implicating TEAD1-Tg skeletal muscle fibers in the regulation of mouse SC number. This work implicates a role for TEAD1-induced, myofiber-derived signaling that can scale the initial SC pool size during the perinatal period. Additionally, TEAD1 overexpression appears to alter myofiber stability in the context of dystrophic disease. Further study of this mouse model will be invaluable in elucidation of physiological pathways controlling stem cell numbers, and may prove to be an entry point to modulating SC number in clinical settings."

To this end, we previously identified a regulatory role for Tead1 in the induction of slow muscle gene expression: skeletal muscle of TEAD1-Tg mice features a transition to the slow muscle contractile phenotype (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tsika et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Vyas et al., 1999</a>). To further confirm this transition, we employed immunofluorescence\u00a0(IF) analysis to tibialis\u00a0anterior\u00a0(TA) muscle cross-sections from adult TEAD1-Tg and wild\u00a0type\u00a0(Wt) sibling mice using antibodies against fiber-type specific myosins (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Fast glycolytic myofibers express IIX myosin and make up approximately half of all TA fibers of Wt mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). By contrast, this fiber type is absent in TEAD1-Tg TA muscle (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; quantification in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). Reciprocal analysis using an antibody detecting any myosin but the IIX type confirmed the complete loss of this fiber type as all TA muscle fibers stained positive in TEAD1-Tg samples (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>; quantification in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). While the low percentage of slow twitch (I myosin<sup>+</sup>) fibers is not affected, a more than 2-fold increase in IIa myosin<sup>+</sup> fibers suggests that the fast glycolytic fibers are replaced in large part by fast oxidative fibers in TEAD1-Tg TA muscles (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>; quantification in\u00a0<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). Whether additional tissue alterations accompany this TEAD1-induced change in fiber-type composition is unknown. For further characterization, we decided to evaluate muscle fiber number (hyperplasia) and size (hypertrophy) in TEAD1-Tg mice."

Histological staining by haematoxylin and eosin (H and E), as well as, by Sirius Red of the chosen muscle groups from 3-months old TEAD1-Tg and Wt littermates did not reveal histopathology as myofiber nuclei were peripherally located, and interstitial spacing between individual fibers was normal with no excess collagen or mononucleated cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013P</a>). TEAD1-Tg mice also did not display muscle hypertrophy, as weights of all analyzed hind limb muscles were unchanged (Table 4). Because its fibers extend the entire length of the\u00a0muscle, the EDL muscle facilitates accurate determination of myofib er number and size in cross sections. No differences were detected in myofiber number (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Q</a>), or in myofiber size by cross-sectional area (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1R</a>) and fiber diameter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1S</a>) between TEAD1-Tg and Wt samples.

                                "text": "During muscle development, SCs gradually become quiescent by 3\u20134 weeks after birth (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lepper et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">White et al., 2010</a>). Intriguingly, peak HA-TEAD1 expression is detected prior to this time, at around postnatal day 14 (PN\u00a014d) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tsika et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, we next examined whether TEAD1-Tg muscles show SC hyperplasia during this early postnatal time period. SCs were quantified in hind limb muscles of TEAD1-Tg and Wt sibling mice at designated postnatal time points (PN\u00a010d, PN\u00a012d, PN\u00a014d and PN 20d), as was\u00a0done\u00a0for adult muscles at three months (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, Materials and methods). To monitor SC proliferation during the postnatal period, we applied the thymidine analogue EdU. At PN\u00a010d and PN\u00a012d, we did not detect differences in the numbers of sublaminal Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells or in the percentages of EdU<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells between TEAD1-Tg and Wt sibling TA muscles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B<sup>iii</sup></a>; quantification in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,G</a>). At PN\u00a014d, TEAD1-Tg TA muscles had begun accumulating an ~1.5-fold greater number of Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells when compared to Wt TA muscles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). This difference became greater at PN\u00a020d when TA muscles boasted a &gt;3-fold increase in SCs in TEAD1-Tg versus Wt mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D<sup>iii</sup></a>; quantification in\u00a0<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E-F</a>). Quantification of the percentage of sublaminal Pax7<sup>+</sup>/EdU<sup>+</sup> cells at PN\u00a020d revealed a significant 2-fold increase in the percentage of proliferative SCs in TEAD1-Tg compared to Wt TA muscles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Conceivably, SCs could be protected from cell death in TEAD1-Tg muscle, which could contribute to the greater number of SCs. To assay for SC apoptosis, we performed TUNEL labeling coupled with anti-Pax7 IF on\u00a0TA\u00a0muscle sections from TEAD1-Tg and Wt siblings at PN\u00a014d when initial SC increases are detected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,I</a>). A single instance of co-labeling was detected in the TEAD1-Tg sections (0.15%) while none were observed in the Wt sections (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>) suggesting TEAD1-Tg SC protection from apoptosis does not drive the SC hyperplasia. Together, these data indicate that TEAD1-Tg muscle accumulates super-numeral SCs beginning at ~2 weeks after birth via extending the proliferation period. Such super-numeral SCs appear to be excluded from fusion with the myofiber (no increase in the myonuclei/fiber ratio), providing the basis for the specific increase of SCs over myonuclei number."

To determine if super-numeral SCs of TEAD1-Tg mice have acquired the quiescent muscle stem cell state, we performed extensive marker and proliferation analyses in adult (3-months old) mice. First, we determined proper niche localization of SCs using anti-Pax7 and anti-laminin dual-IF staining (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). All SCs of TEAD1-Tg muscle localized to the sublaminal space (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Next, we analyzed SC polarity using \u03b21-Integrin as a basal marker and M-Cadherin as an apical marker (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013F</a>). Similar to controls, \u226580% of SCs displayed proper polarity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Calcitonin receptor (CTR) is specifically expressed by quiescent SCs and important for maintenance of quiescence (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fukada et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yamaguchi et al., 2015</a>). Like Wt SCs, SCs from TEAD1-Tg mice express CTR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I\u2013J<sup>i</sup></a>; quantification in\u00a0<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4KJ</a>) and also the general stem cell marker, CD34 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a>). These data suggest that super-numeral adult SCs of TEAD1-Tg mice maintain proper cell polarity, niche interaction, as well as the quiescent state. To probe the quiescent state more rigorously, we conducted long-term proliferation assays via administering BrdU in the drinking water for a month and assaying for BrdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei in the sublaminal space (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L\u2013M</a>). No differences were found in proliferation between SCs of TEAD1-Tg and those of Wt muscles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4N\u2013O</a>). All together, we conclude that super-numeral SCs of TEAD1-Tg muscle acquire and maintain proper niche occupation and\u00a0cell polarity, as well as, the quiescent state typical of adult muscle stem cells."

To determine this, the TA muscles of adult (2\u20133 months old) TEAD1-Tg and Wt littermates were injured by intra-muscular injection of cardiotoxin (CTX; see Materials and methods). Histological analyses of muscle regenerates were performed 3, 7, and 14 days post injury (dpi, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013F<sup>i</sup></a>). Remarkably, while not detectable in Wt samples, very small regenerative myotubes could be detected histologically at 3 dpi in TEAD1-Tg regenerates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B<sup>i</sup></a>), indicating that the regeneration process is accelerated in muscle with super-numeral SCs. To confirm this, we applied IF analyses using embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC) as a marker for early regenerated myotubes and found widespread and robust eMyHC expression in TEAD1-Tg muscle regenerates, which is in contrast to Wt regenerates, for which eMyHC expression is more sparse and less robust (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I\u2013J<sup>i</sup></a>). At 7 and 14 dpi, regenerative myofibers with centrally located myonuclei were present in both Wt and TEAD1-Tg samples, with no evidence of fibrosis or immune cell infiltration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013F<sup>i</sup></a>), demonstrating that TEAD1-Tg muscle retains full regenerative capacity. Consistent with the accelerated formation of new myofibers at 3 dpi, when we quantified the sizes of regenerated myofibers at 7 dpi, we found both fiber area and diameter to be significantly increased in TEAD1-Tg muscle regenerates compared to Wt (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013H</a>). By 14 dpi, no difference in fiber size was detected. Maturation of regenerative myofibers is normal in TEAD1-Tg TA muscles as fiber sizes were no different compared to Wt at 35 dpi (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013H</a>). These data demonstrate that TEAD1-Tg muscle features accelerated kinetics of initial myotube formation upon injury. Despite this accelerated regeneration process and super-numeral SCs, we are surprised that no myofiber hypertrophy resulted from the injury-induced regenerative myogenesis. We therefore suggest that these two processes are separable."

To test if super-numeral SCs of TEAD1-Tg muscle can self-renew, we assayed for their capacity to support repeated regeneration bouts. For this, we injured the TA muscles of TEAD1-Tg and Wt littermates three times, allowing 5 weeks between injuries for complete regeneration (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Indeed, robust regeneration in both singly (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,D</a>) and triply (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,E</a>) injured TA muscles of both Wt and TEAD1-Tg mice were observed. We did not detect any excess collagen deposition in TEAD1-Tg TA muscles after one or three injury-induced regeneration bouts compared to Wt TA muscles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F\u2013I</a>). These data demonstrate that super-numeral SCs of TEAD1-Tg skeletal muscle retain regenerative capacity after repeated injury and suggest that these SCs self-renew (to maintain their numbers as cells are recruited for fusion into myofibers). To test if these SCs participated in and contributed to the regeneration process prior to replenishing the Pax7<sup>+</sup> muscle reserve cell pool, we interrogated whether Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs of skeletal muscle regenerates had proliferated by administering EdU during the proliferative period of the regeneration process to mark cells in S-Phase. Two weeks after injury, we could readily detect EdU<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells in both Wt and TEAD1-Tg samples (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J\u2013K</a>). We did not detect any statistically significant differences in the percentages of EdU<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs between Wt and TEAD1-Tg samples (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7L</a>). These data further support that SCs of TEAD1-Tg mice are self-renewing. Furthermore, we not only detected sublaminal Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs in singly-, but also in triply-injured TA muscles of both TEAD1-Tg and Wt littermates (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7M\u2013P</a>). Quantification of the number of Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs revealed that super-numeral SCs are maintained in skeletal muscle regenerates of TEAD1-Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7Q\u2013R</a>), though the magnitude of the typical 5-fold increase in SCs in uninjured muscle is reduced to ~3.5-fold after one and ~3-fold after three injuries (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7R</a>). This reduction in the magnitude of the SC hyperplasia after three injuries could reflect a diminished self-renewal capacity. All together, these data demonstrate that super-numeral SCs of TEAD1-Tg muscle can self-renew and maintain the tissue\u2019s high capability for regeneration after repeated traumatic insults."

                                "text": "To challenge the regenerative capacity of TEAD1-Tg muscle further, we subjected the tissue to a state of chronic degeneration. To accomplish this, we bred TEAD1-Tg mice to the <i>mdx</i> mouse, a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is the most severe form of the muscle wasting diseases. These mice lack the sarcolemmal protein dystrophin, which results in greatly destabilized muscle fibers and thus, chronically injured and regenerating muscle tissue, evidenced by the presence of many regenerative myofibers with centrally located nuclei, a hallmark pathological feature of this disease. Histological analyses revealed greatly reduced numbers of regenerative muscle fibers in <i>mdx</i>; TEAD1-Tg compared to <i>mdx</i> TA muscles of 2\u20133 months old littermates (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013B</a>). The percentage of fibers with central nuclei was reduced from ~55% in Wt to less than 20% in TEAD1-Tg muscles (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), implying less degeneration in <i>mdx</i>; TEAD1-Tg muscle. We also noted a concomitant significant reduction in myofiber hypertrophy, a secondary pathological feature of the <i>mdx</i> dystrophy model (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013E</a>). To further probe the extent of improvement of the dystrophic phenotype, we assayed for fibrosis, another histological hallmark feature of skeletal muscle dystrophy. Trichrome stainings revealed a significant reduction in fibrotic area in <i>mdx</i>; TEAD1-Tg compared to <i>mdx</i> muscle (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F\u2013G</a>; quantification in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>). Dystrophic muscle fibers have an altered sarcolemmal permeability, which can be assessed via Evans Blue Dye (EBD) uptake. While large numbers of EBD positive fibers where detected in <i>mdx</i> muscle, EBD incorporation by fibers of <i>mdx</i>; TEAD1-Tg mice was largely stunted (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I\u2013J</a>; quantification in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8K</a>). The absence of evidence for worsened muscle pathology and by contrast, an amelioration of the dystrophy argues for SCs being functional in dystrophic TEAD1-Tg muscle. Lastly, we assayed for SCs in dystrophic muscle of <i>mdx</i> and <i>mdx</i>; TEAD1-Tg littermates (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8L\u2013M</a>). Quantification of Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells revealed an ~2-fold increase in SCs in <i>mdx</i>; TEAD1-Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8N</a>). While less dramatic compared to the fold increase observed in healthy muscle, the SC hyperplasia in dystrophic muscle is quite substantial considering the baseline SC numbers are already increased due to higher SC proliferation in the chronically de- and regenerating environment. The magnitude of the SC hyperplasia is potentially also affected by impaired dystrophin-deficient SCs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dumont et al., 2015b</a>)."

To test this prediction, we performed in vitro myoblast culture experiments either in the absence or presence of the associated TEAD1-Tg myofiber (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013U</a>). First, we cultured primary myoblasts derived from either TEAD1-Tg or Wt hind limb muscles (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013M</a>). We detected no differences in the differentiation or proliferation capacities between them. Upon serum starvation, myoblasts from either genotype readily differentiated as indicated by early (MyoD), late (Myogenin), and terminal (myosin heavy chain) differentiation marker expression (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013I</a>; quantified in<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9J</a>). Proliferation assays using EdU incorporation, also revealed no differences between primary myoblasts from TEAD1-Tg and from Wt muscles (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9K\u2013L</a>; quantified in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9M</a>). To determine if the TEAD1-Tg myofiber affects proliferation of its attached cohort of SCs, we cultured single myofibers from EDL muscles of TEAD1-Tg and Wt littermates and determined SC proliferation via cumulative marking of Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells in S-Phase via EdU (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9N\u2013O</a>; quantification in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9P</a>). The majority (~92%) of SCs on Wt fibers proliferated. The proportion of proliferating SCs was significantly increased on TEAD1-Tg myofibers, as all Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells are positive for EdU (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9P</a>). No statistically significant differences in apoptotic rates were found via anti-Caspase-3/Pax7 co-IF staining (~0.8\u00b11.4% versus ~3.2\u00b11% Caspase3<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells on Wt and TEAD1-Tg fibers, respectively; p&gt;0.05). To determine the effect of the increased proliferation rate on SC clone formation, we quantified SCs on single myofibers at t=0\u00a0hr, and number of clones as well as clone size at t=72\u2009hr on both Wt and TEAD1-Tg myofibers (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Q\u2013R</a>). As expected, we found significantly increased numbers of SCs associated with freshly isolated TEAD1-Tg compared to Wt myofibers (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Q</a>). At t=72\u00a0hr, the number of SC clones vastly exceeded that of the starting number of SCs for both Wt and TEAD1-Tg samples suggesting that some clones split into 2 or more clones (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Q</a>). Yet, significantly greater numbers of cells were found per clone on TEAD1-Tg compared to Wt fibers (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9R</a>). This evidence suggests that increased proliferation yields larger clones on TEAD1-Tg cultured myofibers rather than fusion of clones derived from multiple SCs, as clone fracturing occurs more frequently than clone fusion and at similar rates between Wt and TEAD1-Tg samples (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9N\u2013R</a>). We next assayed cells of these clones for differentiating (MyoD<sup>+</sup>), expanding (MyoD<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup>), and self-renewing (Pax7<sup>+</sup>) cell fates (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9S\u2013T</a>). Quantification revealed that hyper-proliferation of SCs on TEAD1-Tg myofibers does not alter the relative distributions of these cell fates, but instead involves a proportional increase in the sizes of each fraction (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9U</a>). These data further confirm the SC self-renewal capacity in vivo (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

Since the TEAD1-Tg features a transition to the slow-twitch muscle contractile phenotype, i.e. loss of type IIX fibers (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tsika et al., 2008</a>), the pervasiveness of the SC hyperplasia among the different muscles analyzed is particularly noteworthy. Higher SC densities have been found in slow-twitch compared to fast-twitch muscles (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gibson and Schultz, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Schmalbruch and Hellhammer, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Collins et al., 2005</a>). As such, the fast- to slow-twitch fiber transition may account for the SC hyperplasia in TEAD1-Tg mice. However, the pre-dominantly slow-twitch soleus muscle, which is devoid of type IIX fibers, features the largest increase (6-fold) in SCs in TEAD1-Tg mice. Hence, the increase in SCs cannot solely be a \u2018passenger effect\u2019 of the fast- to slow-twitch fiber transition. The SC hyperplasia originates at the time of peak TEAD1 transgene expression around PN\u00a014d (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and eventually features normal quiescent adult SCs indistinguishable from their Wt counterparts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In particular, we utilized this new mouse model of SC hyperplasia to investigate whether an increase in the physical number of stem cells had any impact on skeletal muscle regeneration and discovered faster regeneration kinetics in TEAD1-Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). The SC hyperplasia persists through multiple and chronic injuries (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>) and notably, derives from cell-cell signaling between the myofiber and the SCs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). All together, these features uniquely prime the TEAD1-Tg mouse model for the future discovery of the elusive signaling pathway(s) regulating muscle stem cell number."

For example, skeletal muscle mutant for Collagen VI has an ~2.4-fold increase in SCs. As mutations in this gene cause myopathy or muscular dystrophy in humans (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lampe and Bushby, 2005</a>), Collagen VI mutant mice also feature dystrophic muscle, which leads to SC activation as evidenced by increased proliferation and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib54\">Urciuolo et al., 2013</a>). Hence an increase in SCs is also observed in <i>mdx</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boldrin et al., 2009</a>). As such, this model features impaired regeneration and a failure to sustain the SC hyperplasia during injury-induced regenerative myogenesis (<a href=\"#bib54\">Urciuolo et al., 2013</a>). Likewise, ectopic application of Wnt7a in adult regenerative muscle drives an ~2-fold expansion of proliferative SCs. No accelerated kinetics of muscle repair were noted but muscles featured both hypertrophy and hyperplasia (<a href=\"#bib24\">Le Grand et al., 2009</a>). Subsequently, Wnt7a was shown to directly act on the myofiber for induction of hypertrophy (<a href=\"#bib55\">von Maltzahn et al., 2012a</a>). The expansion of SCs by Wnt7a can be further increased by the co-application with fibronectin. Whether the additional SC increase impacted myofiber hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia was not reported (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bentzinger et al., 2013</a>). The source of Wnt7a in skeletal muscle is unresolved. Also, the Wnt7a-induced increase in SCs may be indirectly coupled to the myofiber hypertrophy, precluding a concrete conclusion about the signaling for the SC expansion."

They feature many distinct aspects including a less robust increase of SCs, a non-developmental origin of SC increase, overall muscle tissue hypertrophy and/or failure to generate a stably quiescent pool of adult SCs. The TEAD1 transgene induced SC hyperplasia is of the greatest known magnitude to-date, stably established during early postnatal development and features a normal adult quiescent phenotype. The timing of the SC increase in TEAD1-Tg muscle is particularly noteworthy and should incite new investigations of the aforementioned mouse models during the early postnatal period to further unravel this fundamental 'stem cell scaling' process in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, while myofiber-specific TEAD1 overexpression reveals a surprising plasticity of the muscle stem cell niche to harbor greatly increased SCs, we do not\u00a0know if there are any functional requirements for the Tead transcription factor family in the regulation of SC number. Further studies of Tead loss-of-function mouse models are needed."

Adult SCs are kept in a quiescent state, while early postnatal SCs are highly proliferative providing differentiated myonuclei for muscle growth as they progressively exit the cell cycle to be set aside as quiescent stem cells during the first three weeks after birth (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lepper et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">White et al., 2010</a>). The signals that orchestrate the SC transition from the proliferative to the quiescent state are unknown but likely entail both \u2018proliferation\u2019 and \u2018quiescence\u2019 cues from the local niches leading to the formation of an adult muscle stem cell pool of defined size. Super-numeral SCs and increased SC proliferation were first detected in TEAD1-Tg muscle during this early postnatal period at 2 weeks after birth (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Since TEAD1-Tg muscle is not hypertrophic and does not accumulate more nuclei than Wt (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>), a 'Stop' signal must exist, and be still intact in TEAD1-Tg mice to prevent further fusion by excessive SCs. Thus, we propose that the extra rounds of SC proliferation are a selectively symmetric expansion of the stem cell pool. The likely mechanism driving the SC hyperplasia is over-expression or prolonged expression of physiologically normal \u2018proliferation\u2019 factor(s), or reduced expression of \u2018quiescence\u2019 factor(s) in early postnatal TEAD1-Tg muscle. Therefore, this animal model may also be useful to uncover the physiological signaling underlying the complex transition from a proliferative juvenile progenitor to a quiescent adult stem cell."

This conclusion is further supported by the observation that the TEAD1 transgene induced SC hyperplasia is maintained even over several injury-induced regeneration cycles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Of note, the magnitude of the hyperplasia is slightly lessened with multiple bouts of regeneration. It is possible that the SC self-renewal capacity is slightly reduced in TEAD1-Tg mice. It is also possible that the regenerating tissue lacks the ability to promote SC hyperplasia to the same degree as the early postnatal myofiber. The adult niche is destroyed by injury leading to a transient loss of the TEAD1-expressing cell, i.e. the muscle fiber. This is in contrast to the \u2018intact\u2019 early postnatal niche, which drives the establishment of super-numeral SCs in TEAD1-Tg mice and features intimate contact between the TEAD1-expressing muscle fiber and its SCs. Moreover, there appear to be differences in the regulation of proliferating early postnatal versus quiescent adult SCs. Temporally-controlled inactivation of Pax7 in SCs shortly after birth leads to an immediate dramatic loss in regenerative capacity while inactivation in the adult leads to a slow progressive loss of SCs, which is reflected by normal regeneration over the short-term and impaired regeneration over the long-term (<a href=\"#bib19\">G\u00fcnther et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lepper et al., 2009</a>). It is possible that early postnatal SCs are uniquely primed to receiving proliferation and quiescence cues from their local niches, which leads to the formation of a properly proportioned adult muscle stem cell pool. Such cues may be expressed at a higher level or for a longer period of time in the developing muscles than in adult regenerating muscles of TEAD1-Tg mice. Or, the adult SC niche may be more restrictive to proliferation, and thus limiting to the extent of re-establishment of the SC hyperplasia during regeneration. For example, the stiffness of the extracellular matrix from skeletal muscle has been demonstrated to increase with age (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wood et al., 2014</a>), and substrate elasticity has been shown\u00a0to affect the regenerative competence of SCs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gilbert et al., 2010</a>). Along this line of thought, it is interesting to note that neither developmental nor regenerative muscles of TEAD1-Tg mice produce hypertrophy despite the SC hyperplasia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). It seems reasonable that upon acquiring the \u2018correct\u2019 number of myonuclei, to efficiently support the transcriptional and metabolic needs, the myofiber sends 'dominant' signal(s) to prevent additional fusion by SCs, and possibly to stop SC proliferation. A longer period of SC proliferation during early postnatal development versus adult regeneration could be the basis for the plasticity of the magnitude of the SC hyperplasia."

This finding can likely be accounted for based on a TEAD1-induced slow-oxidative phenotype in both fast and slow-twitch muscles, which we determined previously by high-resolution electrophoretic separation and quantification of native myosin heavy chain isoforms and confirmed here by IF (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tsika et al., 2008</a>). This notion is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that slow-twitch oxidative fibers in human and murine dystrophic muscles are less susceptible to the degenerative outcome of muscular dystrophies than are fast-twitch fibers (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moens et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Webster et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Consolino and Brooks, 2004</a>). More recent therapeutic efforts shown to mitigate the dystrophic pathology in the <i>mdx</i> model have utilized transgenic (calcineurin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1, AMP-activated protein kinase, Kruppel-like factor 15) or pharmacological (Resveratol, AICAR, GW501516, Wnt7a) mediators, all previously shown to remodel dystrophic muscle to reflect a greater proportion of slow-oxidative fiber-types (<a href=\"#bib51\">Stupka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chakkalakal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Handschin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hori et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tabebordbar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ljubicic et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">von Maltzahn et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Morrison-Nozik et al., 2015</a>). It is therefore conceivable that the TEAD1-Tg-induced slow-oxidative myofiber phenotype ameliorates dystrophic pathology in <i>mdx</i> muscle in similar fashion to the aforementioned studies. In particular, utrophin, which can functionally substitute for dystrophin, is elevated in slow-twitch when compared to fast-twitch muscle (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gramolini et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rafael et al., 1998</a>). Elevated <i>utrophin</i> transcript levels in <i>mdx</i>; TEAD1-Tg muscle are a highly likely contributor to the betterment of the dystrophic pathology (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Additional mechanisms are likely at play. Calcineurin is a direct transcriptional activator of utrophin and skeletal-muscle specific overexpression results in increased utrophin protein levels and results in amelioration of the dystrophic pathology (<a href=\"#bib51\">Stupka et al., 2006</a>). Yet, the extent of the observed amelioration is significantly smaller when compared to the <i>mdx</i>; TEAD1-Tg model. Additional properties of the myofiber affected by the TEAD1 transgene could further protect the fiber from degeneration. It is also possible that the increased number of SCs in <i>mdx</i>; TEAD1-Tg muscle contributes to a more speedy repair process, thereby stabilizing the dystrophic muscle. Or, both mechanisms may contribute. Additionally, it would be of great interest to quantify SCs in the murine models above to determine if their numbers are increased as well, which could also potentially contribute to an ameliorated disease state."

To extend this idea, it is of interest to consider the exquisite molecular mechanisms that have evolved to initially establish and then maintain proper skeletal muscle tissue size. Signaling pathways including Hippo, IGF-1, Wnt, calcium (via NFAT), and TGF-\u03b2 contribute to the regulation of myofiber size and number. In particular, the TGF-\u03b2 family member myostatin and its receptor activin receptor type-IIB (ActRIIB) play prominent roles, as both genetic inactivation of myostatin and ActRIIB antagonism result in a double muscling phenotype in mice with both hyperplasia and hypertrophy (<a href=\"#bib35\">McPherron et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lee and McPherron, 2001</a>). However, it remains controversial whether a corresponding SC increase accompanies and is required for the increase in muscle mass by inhibition of myostatin signaling (<a href=\"#bib34\">McCroskery et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang and McPherron, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). Inactivation of ActRIIB specifically in the myofiber causes myofiber hypertrophy arguing against myofiber size regulation being dependent on the SC pool (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). Likewise, myostatin inhibition has been shown to result in skeletal muscle hypertrophy in the absence of satellite cell activity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amthor et al., 2009</a>). Canonical Wnt signaling has been implicated in regulating myogenic progenitor and myofiber number during fetal myogenesis and muscle repair after injury (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hutcheson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Murphy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rudolf et al., 2016</a>). Similarly, calcium signaling via NFAT proteins has been implicated in regulating skeletal muscle size (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schulz and Yutzey, 2004</a>). In our previous work, we found both Wnt and NFAT signaling to be significantly reduced in TEAD1-Tg muscle (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tsika et al., 2008</a>). Yet, we did not find muscle tissue size to be altered (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This apparent discrepancy can likely be attributed to the late onset of MCK promoter driven TEAD1 transgene expression, which happens after muscle differentiation. Thus, neither differentiation nor fusion is affected in these mice. And the non-autonomous induction of super-numeral SCs results in the uncoupling of the molecular regulation of SC number from muscle size in TEAD1-Tg mice. Similarly, muscle groups of different ontology appear to maintain different SC to muscle nuclei ratios, i.e. branchiomeric muscles have significantly fewer SCs compared to somite-derived muscles (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ono et al., 2010</a>). Still, muscle fibers and their associated cohort of SCs have co-evolved to maintain a relatively fixed ratio. While the evolutionary selection pressures for both processes are unknown they are of great biological curiosity."

Samples were cryo-sectioned at 10\u00a0\u00b5m and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (VWR 48311\u2013703). Following fixation for 10 min (4% PFA/PBS) on ice and PBS wash, antigen retrieval was performed (Dako S1699). Slides were placed in a solution of Sudan black dye (0.1%, Sigma 199664) in ethanol (70%) for 20 min to lessen autofluorescence. Samples were then blocked with 10% normal goat serum diluted in 0.02% triton-100/PBS (PBT). Subsequent primary and secondary antibodes were used at concentrations described (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">3</a>) diluted in 2% FBS in 0.02% PBT for one hour to overnight in a humidified chamber. TUNEL labeling was performed immediately following the IF staining protocol using the ApopTag Red In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore, S7165). Coverslips were mounted with a drop of mounting media (Vector Laboratories, H1200) and sealed. All IF images were obtained using Nikon E800 and Zeiss Axioscop microscopes (described below)."

With exception of the conclusions regarding satellite cell self-renewal, the authors are careful to avoid overstating or over interpreting their findings, which include several novel and important observations, including: (1) that TEAD1 overexpression in muscle fibers results in a large excess of quiescent satellite cells at birth. This has really interesting implications and supports the notion that the satellite cell niche has room, under the right circumstances, and (2) that having more satellite cells can speed regeneration without causing hypertrophy or prematurely depleting the stem cell pool. Yet, there remain certain aspects of the conclusions that are less well supported by the currently available data. The reviewers engaged in a lively discussion about these issues, and while full agreement could not be achieved, consensus did emerge that certain additional studies are necessary, as detailed below."

All reviewers expressed concerns about the authors' interpretation of satellite cell self-renewal (subsection \u201cSuper-numeral SCs of TEAD1-Tg muscle retain full regenerative capacity over repeated injury-induced regeneration bouts\u201d, first paragraph). To support their claim, they really need to document loss (and subsequent recovery) of satellite cell number in response to injury, together with BrdU/Edu staining. Otherwise, they cannot exclude the alternative interpretation that the reduction in fold increase (from 6-fold to 3-fold) could reflect a lack of self-renewal (due to incorporation of satellite cells into fibers and failure to regain \"homeostatic\" satellite cell numbers). It is also possible that there is an effect on fusion, which should be investigated through direct experimentation, such as lineage tracing. Several groups have used lineage tracing to mark SCs and demonstrate that there is ongoing SC fusion into myofibers in the adult mouse, which may be occurring in the absence of SC division. One would predict that an increase in SCs would cause an increase in SC fusion. Lineage tracing of TEAD-1 tg mice with an appropriate lineage marker is well within the expertise of the authors and could aid in further delineating the observed phenotypes. Thus, extensive additional data are needed to support the self-renewal claims, and the authors may instead wish to edit the text to remove that claim from the Results section."

All reviewers expressed concerns about the authors' interpretation of satellite cell self-renewal (subsection \u201cSuper-numeral SCs of TEAD1-Tg muscle retain full regenerative capacity over repeated injury-induced regeneration bouts\u201d, first paragraph). To support their claim, they really need to document loss (and subsequent recovery) of satellite cell number in response to injury, together with BrdU/Edu staining. Otherwise, they cannot exclude the alternative interpretation that the reduction in fold increase (from 6-fold to 3-fold) could reflect a lack of self-renewal (due to incorporation of satellite cells into fibers and failure to regain \"homeostatic\" satellite cell numbers). It is also possible that there is an effect on fusion, which should be investigated through direct experimentation, such as lineage tracing. Several groups have used lineage tracing to mark SCs and demonstrate that there is ongoing SC fusion into myofibers in the adult mouse, which may be occurring in the absence of SC division. One would predict that an increase in SCs would cause an increase in SC fusion. Lineage tracing of TEAD-1 tg mice with an appropriate lineage marker is well within the expertise of the authors and could aid in further delineating the observed phenotypes. Thus, extensive additional data are needed to support the self-renewal claims, and the authors may instead wish to edit the text to remove that claim from the Results section.</i> "

We disagree with the Referee\u2019s opinion that an initial loss of SCs in injury-induced regeneration with subsequent SC recovery needs to be documented to draw a conclusion about SC self-renewal. Indeed, intra-vital imaging of lineage-labeled SCs does not reveal any loss of SCs in response to injury (Webster et al., Cell Stem Cell, 2015). Thus, it appears such an assay would be unreliable to assessing SC self-renewal. Our new regeneration experiments including EdU show that a large percentage of SCs have proliferated prior to replenishing the SC pool in TEAD1-Tg muscle regenerates, which demonstrates their ability to self-renew (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J-L</a>; subsection \u201cSuper-numeral SCs of TEAD1-Tg muscle retain full regenerative capacity over repeated injury-induced regeneration bouts\u201d. 12-20).

We refrain from drawing any conclusions about the normal homeostatic maintenance of the SC hyperplasia. While we agree that future studies of the TEAD1-Tg mouse model during long-term tissue homeostasis and/or aging are much desired, they are outside the scope and focus of our present study. However, we have expanded on our discussion regarding the reduction in the fold-increase of SCs upon regeneration. Along this line, we find the Referee\u2019s remark regarding a potential lack of self-renewal to be highly insightful. Our new data argues against a complete lack of self-renewal. However, we concede that a diminished self-renewal capacity could account for the reduction in the fold-increase of SCs after injury. The Referee\u2019s comment forced us to think more deeply about the change in the magnitude of the SC hyperplasia. In contrast to the early post-natal SC niche that drives the establishment of super-numeral SCs in TEAD1-Tg mice, the adult niche is destroyed by injury. The transient loss of the TEAD1-expressing cell, i.e. the muscle fiber, likely diminishes the ability of the tissue to promote SC hyperplasia to the same degree as the early post-natal myofiber. We have expanded our Discussion section accordingly to account for these two possible scenarios (subsection \u201cReduced SC hyperplasia of regenerated muscle\u201d)."

But we believe the identification of the origin of the amelioration of the dystrophy, e.g. increased SCs or increase in slow-twitch muscle program, to be deserving of an entirely separate study. To this end, prior publications reporting amelioration of dystrophy via shifting fast-twitch to slow-twitch myofibers did not investigate any potential contributions from SCs. The Referee suggested ablating SCs in our model to determine whether this blunts the improvement. We believe this to be a good experiment though it is unclear if conclusive answers can be gained from such studies. As far as we know, SC ablation in the <i>mdx</i> mouse model has not been done yet. Thus, it is not clear when the ablation can be performed and how long mice would survive. In fact, our Pax7-CreERT2 allele cannot be used for such experiments as even non-dystrophic mice die within a week after SC ablation (Development, 2011). Use of different Pax7-CreERT2 alleles could complicate the analysis, as SC ablation is incomplete. Furthermore, SC ablation in the <i>mdx;</i> TEAD1-Tg mouse would likely need to be performed at or prior to the initial onset of the SC hyperplasia 2 weeks after birth since the observed muscle improvement is a cumulative effect of myofiber-specific TEAD1 expression beginning much before the onset of the pathology in <i>mdx</i> mice. SC ablation during the early period after birth when muscle is still growing by fusion from SCs has not been attempted but may likely impact the normal growth of the muscle tissue, therefore rendering this approach impractical to obtain any conclusive data. We do agree that a separate study regarding the contribution, if any, of SCs to the improvement of the dystrophic phenotype should be done. Ideally, such a study should include all prior models based on a shift from fast- to slow-twitch muscle program and yielding amelioration of the dystrophic phenotype. We expanded our discussion about the amelioration of the dystrophic pathology in <i>mdx;</i> TEAD1-Tg mice to account for our finding of compensatory utrophin up-regulation and unknown contribution (if any) from extra-numeral SCs (subsection \u201cAmeliorated dystrophy in <i>mdx</i>; TEAD1-Tg mice\u201d)."

Moreover, such SC engraftments would need to be performed into early postnatal muscle at the onset of the SC hyperplasia (around 2 weeks after birth).

While we observe a rather moderate TEAD1 overexpression levels (e.g. 3.3-fold in the gastrocnemius and 2.4-fold in the soleus), this could still result in transcriptional outcomes normally not affected by endogenous TEAD transcription factors. As such, we are careful to not draw conclusions about the role of TEAD1 in skeletal muscle fibers but instead conceptually highlight the surprising plasticity of the muscle stem cell niche to harbor a large excess of SCs concomitant with sped-up muscle regeneration. As such, we would like to argue that whether TEAD1 overexpression could affect non-physiological pathways is of lesser concern for our current study. We agree that loss-of-function studies to elucidate the role of Tead transcription factors in skeletal muscle would be highly informative. At present, such studies are hindered by the co-expression of all four functionally equivalent Tead (TEAD1,2,3,4) transcription factors by skeletal muscle tissue (Tsika et al., 2008 and references within). Furthermore, germline null mutation of TEADs 1 and 4 result in embryonic lethality, and of the small percentage of TEAD2 mice that survive, they carry defects in neural tube closure. Compound null mutations of TEAD1/TEAD2 leads to embryonic lethality. TEAD3 KO mice have not been studied as of yet. Thus, the resulting embryonic lethality of TEAD null mice preclude their use in our ongoing studies requiring the generation of conditional alleles for all four Tead genes."

All four TEAD-transcription factors bind to highly conserved cis-acting regulatory elements (MCAT, A/T-rich) and display overlapping functional roles (Meng et al., Genes &amp; Devlop, 2016). To overcome issues of functional redundancy between the various TEAD family members, dominant negative TEAD constructs (i.e. dnTEAD2) that lack the TEA-DNA binding domain have been generated and tested in vitro and in vivo (e. g., Cao et al., Genes &amp; Dev., 2008). While these constructs are successful in reducing/eliminating TEAD target gene expression, complications arise in data interpretation as the remaining C-terminal portion of TEAD is expressed and harbors the necessary interaction site for its coactivators: YAP, TAZ, and Vgll(<b>1-4</b>) ((Meng et al., Genes &amp; Devlop, 2016). TEADs have very weak activation domains and require interactions with potent co-activators to confer robust gene expression (Meng et al., Genes &amp; Development, 2016). The resulting data will very likely reflect altered TEAD, YAP, TAZ, and Vgll(1-4) gene programs. Ultimately, conditional KO mice for TEAD1-4 would have to be generated. We do not know if transgenic TEAD1 recruits any of its co-activators for affecting the myofiber genetic program resulting in increased SCs. Therefore, it is not clear if this approach could effectively abrogate transcriptional events stemming from TEAD1 activity. Moreover, the role of YAP in skeletal muscle fibers is controversial. While two studies suggest YAP positively regulates myofiber size (Watt et al., Nature Commun., 2015 &amp; Goodman et al., FEBS Letter, 2015), one study implicates YAP in muscle atrophy and myopathy (Judson et al., Plos One, 2013). As such, the use of dominant negative TEAD constructs (involving blocking of YAP) appears impractical to gaining conclusive insight into the functional role of the Tead transcription factors in skeletal muscle fibers. Using gene knock-down approach via shRNA also appears impractical considering that a total of four Tead genes would have to be sufficiently knocked-down by inhibitory constructs. Moreover, virtually any cell in skeletal muscle tissue could be transduced by AAV precluding specific delivery to skeletal muscle fibers. The utility of this approach is further compromised by the rather long <i>lag time</i>after infection for maximal gene<i>expression</i>seen for AAV in virtually all tissues. This presents itself as a potentially significant problem since delivery of shRNA (or DN constructs above) would have to be performed during the early post-natal period when the quiescent SC pool is first established. With an unknown lag time of transgene expression, one cannot know when to deliver the virus. Thus, this approach is also likely futile to assessing Tead function in postnatal skeletal muscle."
