To test the hypothesis that deletion of gD-2 unmasks protective antigens, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of an HSV-2 virus deleted in gD-2 and complemented allowing a single round of replication on cells expressing HSV-1 gD (\u0394<i>gD</i><sup>\u2212/+gD\u22121</sup>). Subcutaneous immunization of C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice with \u0394<i>gD</i><sup>\u2212/+gD1</sup> provided 100% protection against lethal intravaginal or skin challenges and prevented latency. \u0394<i>gD</i><sup>\u2212/+gD1</sup> elicited no disease in SCID mice, whereas 1000-fold lower doses of wild-type virus were lethal. HSV-specific antibodies were detected in serum (titer 1:800,000) following immunization and in vaginal washes after intravaginal challenge. The antibodies elicited cell-mediated cytotoxicity, but little neutralizing activity. Passive transfer of immune serum completely protected wild-type, but not Fc\u03b3-receptor or neonatal Fc-receptor knock-out mice. These studies demonstrate that non-neutralizing Fc-mediated humoral responses confer protection and support advancement of this attenuated vaccine."

To test the hypothesis that deletion of gD-2 unmasks protective antigens, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of an HSV-2 virus deleted in gD-2 and complemented allowing a single round of replication on cells expressing HSV-1 gD (\u0394<i>gD</i><sup>\u2212/+gD\u22121</sup>). Subcutaneous immunization of C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice with \u0394<i>gD</i><sup>\u2212/+gD1</sup> provided 100% protection against lethal intravaginal or skin challenges and prevented latency. \u0394<i>gD</i><sup>\u2212/+gD1</sup> elicited no disease in SCID mice, whereas 1000-fold lower doses of wild-type virus were lethal. HSV-specific antibodies were detected in serum (titer 1:800,000) following immunization and in vaginal washes after intravaginal challenge. The antibodies elicited cell-mediated cytotoxicity, but little neutralizing activity. Passive transfer of immune serum completely protected wild-type, but not Fc\u03b3-receptor or neonatal Fc-receptor knock-out mice. These studies demonstrate that non-neutralizing Fc-mediated humoral responses confer protection and support advancement of this attenuated vaccine."

However, HSV-2 can periodically re-activate, leading to repeated infections; this can be life-threatening in patients who suffer from a weak immune system.

Finally, Petro, Gonz\u00e1lez et al. showed that blood serum from immunized mice could be used to completely protect other mice from exposure to wild-type virus. These results demonstrate that a live attenuated HSV-2 virus that lacks glycoprotein D (the main component of other failed vaccines) elicits a different type of immune response and is a safe and effective vaccine in mouse models of virus infection. With further work, these findings may eventually lead to a preventative treatment to combat HSV-2 infections in humans."

HSV serotype 1 (HSV-1) is associated primarily with oral mucocutaneous disease, sporadic encephalitis, and is a leading cause of corneal blindness worldwide, whereas HSV serotype 2 (HSV-2) is the leading cause of genital ulcerative disease and a major cofactor in fueling the HIV epidemic (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gray et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wald and Link, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Freeman et al., 2006</a>). The World Health Organization estimated that over 500 million people are infected with HSV-2 worldwide with approximately 20 million new cases annually (<a href=\"#bib40\">Looker et al., 2008</a>). The extremely high prevalence of HSV-2 in sub-Saharan Africa (\u223c70%) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Looker et al., 2008</a>) may contribute more to the spread of HIV-1 than number of sex partners or other sexually transmitted infections (<a href=\"#bib25\">Freeman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, as HSV establishes latency in neurons with frequent subclinical or clinical reactivations, there is a lifelong impact of infection. Notably, HSV-1 has emerged as a predominant cause of genital disease in the developed world (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roberts et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Xu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Horowitz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bernstein et al., 2013</a>).

The rationale for gD-2 subunit vaccines included their safety and ability to elicit neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses in vitro. However, the clinical trial outcomes have been disappointing. For example, in the most recent efficacy trial, an HSV-2 gD adjuvanted subunit vaccine provided no protection against HSV-2 genital disease, but surprisingly provided 35% cross-protection against HSV-1 infection and 58% cross-protection against HSV-1 disease (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belshe et al., 2012</a>).

We adopted a different attenuated vaccine strategy based on an HSV-2 virus genetically deleted for the gene that encodes gD-2 (<i>U</i><sub><i>S</i></sub><i>6</i>) and complemented the virus to allow a first round of replication by growing it on Vero cells encoding HSV-1 <i>U</i><sub><i>S</i></sub><i>6</i> (gD-1, VD60 cells) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cheshenko et al., 2013</a>). The HSV-1 gD complemented HSV-2 mutant virus (designated HSV-2 \u0394<i>gD</i><sup>\u2212/+gD\u22121</sup>) replicates in VD60 cells to high titers, but a single passage through non-complementing cells yields non-infectious progeny, reflecting the requirement for gD in entry and cell-to-cell spread. We evaluated this virus for safety, immunogenicity, and vaccine efficacy against intravaginal challenge and in a skin scarification model in different strains of mice. Subcutaneous prime and boost of mice with HSV-2 \u0394<i>gD</i><sup>\u2212/+gD\u22121</sup> protected against lethal challenge in both models and prevented the establishment of latency.

The current study challenges this paradigm. We found that a live attenuated virus deleted in HSV-2 gD protects mice from vaginal, skin, and neuronal disease. Specifically, we observed no evidence of neurological disease in any model and could not detect virus in DRG of vaccinated mice by ex vivo plaque assays or by qPCR with a lower limit of detection of three viral genomes. The vaccine was effective in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice and elicited high titers of HSV Abs (1:800,000) that were capable of passively protecting mice from both intravaginal and skin challenges. Notably, the Abs had low levels of neutralizing activity but did elicit ADCC and were able to passively transfer protection with a single dose of immune serum. The HSV-specific Abs could not be detected in vaginal washes of vaccinated mice, but were rapidly recruited into the vaginal lumen following intravaginal challenge and were associated with rapid clearance of the virus. Notably, the vaginal wash Abs were predominantly IgG, not IgA (data not shown), which is consistent with prior studies that have shown that while the predominant immunoglobulin by weight in the vaginal mucus of immune mice is secretory IgA, HSV-specific Abs are almost entirely IgG (<a href=\"#bib47\">Parr and Parr, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Parr et al., 1998</a>). The HSV-specific Abs were likely critical for protection as evidenced by the studies with FcRn knockout mice. Passive protection was also lost in Fc\u03b3R knockout mice highlighting the role of Fc-mediated effector mechanisms."

The first attenuated vaccine to be evaluated clinically was a virus deleted in glycoprotein H (gH, <i>U</i><sub><i>L</i></sub><i>22</i>). Unlike the data presented here with the HSV-2 \u0394<i>gD</i> virus<i>,</i> the gH deletion viral vaccine did not prevent the establishment of latency in mice (<a href=\"#bib52\">Speck et al., 1996</a>), was not shown to passively transfer protection and failed to reduce recurrences when evaluated as a therapeutic vaccine in a clinical trial (<a href=\"#bib20\">de Bruyn et al., 2006</a>). More recently, a virus deleted in HSV-2 <i>U</i><sub><i>L</i></sub><i>5</i> and <i>U</i><sub><i>L</i></sub><i>29</i>, which is defective in HSV DNA replication, has been advanced to a Phase 1 study. This deletion virus also differs from the HSV-2 \u0394<i>gD</i><sup>\u2212/+gD\u22121</sup> vaccine candidate described here in that it does not induce as high an Ab response, has not been shown to passively protect, and did not prevent the establishment of latency as low levels of viral DNA were detected in the DRG following both immunization and viral challenge (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hoshino et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dudek et al., 2008</a>).

Thymidine kinase (tk) deletion viruses, which have been used to study HSV immunogenicity because they are attenuated in mice (but not humans), express the full repertoire of viral proteins including gD.

Additionally, gD may modulate immune responses through its interactions with herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) on immune cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">La et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aubert et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Stiles et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kopp et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Grauwet et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sharma et al., 2014</a>). Interactions between gD and HVEM may skew the immune response towards neutralizing Abs whereas in the absence of the gD-HVEM interaction or yet undiscovered immunosuppressive functions of gD, the host may mount a polyantigenic IgG2 dominant response capable of eliciting FcR-mediated protection. This hypothesis will be tested in future studies by: (1) comparing, for example, the immune response to virus in mice deficient for HVEM, (2) examining the immune response to the HSV-2 \u0394<i>gD</i><sup>\u2212/+gD\u22121</sup> vaccine when combined with the gD subunit vaccine, or (3) isolating mutant forms of gD that have lost immunosuppressive functions."

The virus induced no disease in SCID mice inoculated with 1000 times the lethal dose of wild-type virus and to date we have observed no recombinants either by plaque assay or PCR. This likely reflects that the virus is propagated on an HSV-1 and not an HSV-2 complementing cell line.

In contrast, the Varivx/Zostervax vaccine was attenuated through serial passages in human and guinea pig cells and was sequenced after introduction into the clinic. The specific determinants of attenuation are still uncertain. The open reading frame with the most single nucleotide polymorphisms encodes the regulatory protein IE62, but IE62 studies have failed to define a specific polymorphism associated with attenuation. A more recent next-generation sequencing study of an unrelated highly attenuated VZV strain identified a stop codon mutation in ORF0 (herpes simplex virus UL56 homolog) identical to one found in vOka, suggesting that this may be one of the determinants of the attenuation genotype of live VZV vaccines (J Virol, 2012, 86(19): 10695-703).

To experimentally explore this, mice infected via the skin scarification model with HSV-1 and confirmed to be seropositive will be vaccinated and challenged intravaginally with HSV-2 or vice versa. This concern will also be addressed early in the clinical development by testing the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in HSV-2 seronegative subjects who are either HSV-1 seropositive or seronegative. If preexisting immunity to HSV-1 interferes with the vaccine immunogenicity, we will explore complementing the vaccine strain with a gD homologue from a non-human herpesvirus as suggested by the reviewer. Other non-human herpesviruses share partial homology with HSV gD. For example, pseudorabies virus (PrV), which also binds to nectin-1 as an entry receptor, shares 30% amino acid identity and did not substitute for HSV gD in a fusion assay. However, chimeric gD molecules composed of HSV and PRV sequences did substitute, provided the first 285 amino acids were from HSV-1 (PNAS, 2004, 101(50): 17498\u201317503). If needed, we will explore these alternative strategies.

We speculate that antibodies targeting other viral antigens such as glycoprotein B contribute to the cross protection. This notion is supported by the observation that a humanized antibody to gB provided cross protection against HSV-1 and HSV-2 (PNAS, 2013, 110(17), 6760\u20135). Identification of the antigenic targets and subsequent depletion of antigen specific antibodies from the immune serum will enable us to identify the correlates of protection against both HSV-1 (cross-protection) and HSV-2. These studies will be conducted in the future. In addition, we plan to extend studies and test vaccine efficacy against clinical isolates of both HSV-1 and HSV-2.
