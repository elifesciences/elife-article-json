Here, we demonstrate that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition preferentially abrogates the viability of multiple myeloma cell lines. Selective targeting of multiple myeloma cell lines through CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition is the result of direct transcriptional suppression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor IRF4, which is essential for the viability of myeloma cells, and the concomitant repression of the IRF4 target gene <i>c-MYC</i>. Ectopic expression of either IRF4 or MYC antagonizes the phenotypic and transcriptional effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition, highlighting the IRF4/MYC axis as a key component of its mechanism of action. These findings suggest that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition represents a viable therapeutic strategy for targeting multiple myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies dependent on the IRF4 network."

Here, we demonstrate that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition preferentially abrogates the viability of multiple myeloma cell lines. Selective targeting of multiple myeloma cell lines through CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition is the result of direct transcriptional suppression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor IRF4, which is essential for the viability of myeloma cells, and the concomitant repression of the IRF4 target gene <i>c-MYC</i>. Ectopic expression of either IRF4 or MYC antagonizes the phenotypic and transcriptional effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition, highlighting the IRF4/MYC axis as a key component of its mechanism of action. These findings suggest that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition represents a viable therapeutic strategy for targeting multiple myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies dependent on the IRF4 network."

Proteins called CBP and EP300 are two examples of regulatory proteins, and have been implicated in promoting various cancers in humans. Both CBP and EP300 contain a region known as a bromodomain, which binds to proteins associated with DNA. Abnormal activity of the bromodomains of CBP and EP300 may thus promote the onset of cancer."

One notable IRF4 target gene that was down-regulated was the gene that encodes a protein called Myc, which strongly encourages cell division and growth. Conery et al. then supplemented the multiple myeloma cells with extra IRF4 or Myc while treating with the inhibitors and found that this caused the inhibitors to lose most of their effect."

The BET bromodomain inhibitor CPI203 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Devaiah et al., 2012</a>) did not display dose-dependent inhibition in this assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Next, we made use of an imaging-based assay that measures the release of bromodomain-GFP fusion proteins from chromatin upon ligand binding (<a href=\"#bib11\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, chromatin release results in aggregation of fusion proteins into finite speckles whose number and intensity increase with ligand binding. Both SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 promote chromatin release of CBP bromodomain fusion proteins at low micromolar concentrations as quantitated by high-content imaging (10-fold cell shift), comparable to previous results (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Hay et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, both probe compounds release BRD4-BD1 fusion proteins from chromatin at significantly higher concentrations as compared to the selective BET inhibitor CPI203 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Devaiah et al., 2012</a>). Given the cellular selectivity of the compounds, we are confident that at defined concentrations of the inhibitors (\u22642.5 \u03bcM SGC-CBP30 or \u22645 \u03bcM I-CBP112), any observed pharmacological effects are due to on-target inhibition of CBP/EP300 bromodomains."

Notably, 14 of the 15 most sensitive cell lines are of multiple myeloma origin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As effectors of multiple biological processes, CBP and EP300 play important roles in multiple phases of the cell cycle. To assess the requirement of the CBP/EP300 bromodomains in cell cycle progression, we released G0/G1 arrested LP-1 cells in the presence of either DMSO, SGC-CBP30, or I-CBP112. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, the progression of the cells appears normal through G2/M phase (8\u2009hr). Only upon entry into the next cell cycle is there a noticeable alteration in cell cycle progression, with compound-treated cells accumulating in G1 at 16 and 24\u2009hr as compared to DMSO-treated cells. Thus, it appears that the primary phenotypic effect of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition is arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Consistent with these observations, growth inhibition resulting from CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition is accompanied by G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in phenotypically sensitive cell lines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

In contrast, our results suggest that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition preferentially targets a more limited subset of hematologic cell lines, with a bias toward multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma cell lines. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying these phenotypic differences, we carried out RNA sequencing of LP-1 cells treated with SGC-CBP30 or the pan-BET inhibitor CPI203. To narrow our focus to direct transcriptional effects, we examined gene expression changes following short term (6\u2009hr) compound treatment. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, the transcriptional footprint of SGC-CBP30 is more circumscribed than that of CPI203, with far fewer genes differentially expressed. Notably however, the genes differentially expressed by SGC-CBP30 are not simply a subset of those affected by CPI203 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; confirmed with I-CBP112 in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This suggests that the two modalities may target distinct transcriptional pathways."

As expected, gene signatures negatively correlated with CPI203 treatment were dominated by MYC-dependent transcriptional pathways (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). However, while several MYC signatures were also enriched upon treatment with SGC-CBP30, more notable was the enrichment of signatures for pathways important in multiple myeloma (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B and C</a>), which was distinct from the effects of BET inhibition. We noted in particular the significant negative correlation (p-value &lt; 0.05) of 4 gene signatures containing downstream targets of IRF4, a lymphocyte-specific transcription factor that is essential for the survival of multiple myeloma cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shaffer et al., 2008</a>).

The bromodomains of CBP/EP300 are required for the acetylation of histones within a chromatin context, and histone H3 lysine 18 (H3K18) and histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) have been shown to be specifically targeted by CBP/EP300 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jin et al., 2011</a>). To investigate the mechanism of transcriptional suppression of <i>IRF4</i>, we first examined whether CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition causes global reduction in histone acetylation. Following incubation of LP-1 cells with SGC-CBP30, we did not observe any significant changes in the global levels of H3K18 or H3K27 acetylation by Western analysis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). We looked more closely for localized changes in histone acetylation by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, we observed a significant reduction in both H3K18ac and H3K27ac at a previously annotated super-enhancer of IRF4 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Chapuy et al., 2013</a>) as well as at the transcription start site. Notably, this reduction in acetylation is accompanied by a reduction in the chromatin occupancy of EP300, suggesting that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition promotes release of the protein from chromatin leading to a reduction in histone acetylation. It should be noted that broad and complete loss of EP300 was not observed, perhaps suggesting that the bromodomain of EP300 serves to localize it to restricted domains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Importantly, treatment with SGC-CBP30 did not result in global eviction of BRD4, arguing against a direct effect on BET bromodomain proteins (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Viability effects are dependent on the silencing of the transcription factor IRF4, which results in the downstream suppression of c-MYC. CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition thus targets the IRF4/MYC network, which is critical for multiple myeloma cells independent of the upstream oncogenic signal. A recent publication describes the use of the CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitor I-CBP112 to inhibit the growth of leukemic cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Picaud et al., 2015</a>). Our data pointing to the preferential activity of both SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 in multiple myeloma cell lines as compared to leukemic cell lines is consistent with this published work. Similar to our findings, Picaud et al. observed minor cytostatic and limited cytotoxic effects in all leukemic cell lines screened with the exception of Kasumi-1. Only upon examining the effects of I-CBP112 on clonogenic growth did the authors observe more broad phenotypic effects. Thus, while CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition may have robust cytotoxic effects in multiple myeloma, our results do not exclude the possibility that this modality would have additional therapeutic utility in leukemia by targeting leukemic self-renewal."

The selective viability effects and limited transcriptional footprint observed with CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors suggests that this modality is milder than genetic ablation, perhaps affording an acceptable therapeutic index once drug-like molecules are optimized. Our results are more broadly consistent with recent studies using SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 that demonstrated selective phenotypic and transcriptional effects in distinct biological contexts (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hammitzsch et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Picaud et al., 2015</a>)."

Further, recent surveys of the mutational landscape in a variety of tumors have demonstrated frequent loss of function mutations in <i>CREBBP</i> and <i>EP300</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pasqualucci et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Peifer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kishimoto et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Mullighan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). While this evidence implicates CBP/EP300 as tumor suppressors, evidence also supports their oncogenic activity. Rare human leukemias have been found with oncogenic fusion proteins containing either CBP or EP300, and these oncogenic fusion proteins require the activity of CBP or EP300 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Murati et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ohnishi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Yung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of CBP/EP300 in leukemic cell lines and primary patient samples also support the oncogenic role of CBP and EP300 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Picaud et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Giotopoulos et al., 2015</a>). Our data in multiple myeloma are consistent with an activity supporting oncogenic signaling, as either pharmacological inhibition or knockdown resulted in loss of viability. It is unclear whether CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition would have tumor promoting activity in normal tissues. However, concerns about inhibiting potential tumor suppressor activity of CBP/EP300 in normal tissues may be alleviated by a dosing regimen that prevents continuous target coverage in normal tissues."

The activity of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors in multiple myeloma potentially suggests that this modality may modify similar genes regulated by BET bromodomain inhibitors, but transcriptional profiling does not support this notion. At the doses of SGC-CBP30 utilized, CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition appears to have a more circumscribed transcriptional footprint than BET bromodomain inhibition. Phenotypic effects of BET bromodomain inhibition in multiple myeloma are likely due to direct suppression of <i>MYC</i> and <i>BCL2</i>, while the effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition appear to be via suppression of <i>IRF4</i>. The distinct transcriptional effects of the two modalities suggests that combinations may be efficacious. It has in fact been shown that targeting the IRF4 network with lenalidomide and the MYC network with BET bromodomain inhibitors has synergistic effects in mantle cell lymphoma and primary effusion lymphoma (<a href=\"#bib22\">Moros et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2015</a>).

U2OS cells capable of inducibly expressing the ZsGreen-CBPBD fusion protein were generated by lentiviral delivery of the pLVT3G/BRD9-ZsG-CBPBD/TO3G vector, which contains both the inducible fusion protein and the tet transactivator. Cells were selected and maintained in the presence of 15 \u03bcg/ml blasticidin. 5000 cells/well were seeded in 384-well imaging plates in the presence of 2 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline to induce the expression of ZsG-fusion proteins.

Second, we used IRF4 knockdown experiments to demonstrate that cell lines that are phenotypically sensitive to CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition require IRF4 for viability (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

In our experience, manual ChIP-qPCR has been difficult to interpret when using small changes in inhibitor concentrations (i.e. dose-responses), perhaps reflecting inherent assay noise. To address this question, we performed genome-wide ChIP-seq with BRD4 antibodies to address the global changes in BRD4 occupancy following CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition. We utilized the same concentrations of inhibitors used in gene expression and functional experiments in the manuscript for consistency (6 hour treatment with 2.5 \u03bcM SGC-CBP30, 0.25 \u03bcM CPI203). We show in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> that while BRD4 is evicted from some loci upon treatment with SGC-CBP30, there is little correlation with the effects of the pure BET inhibitor CPI203. In contrast, in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a> we show that SGC-CBP30 leads to eviction of EP300 at numerous loci, an effect that is not observed with CPI203 (which in fact increases EP300 enrichment at multiple loci). We finally show some example loci with BRD4 and EP300 ChIP-seq tracks following SGC-CBP30 and CPI203 treatment (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Note the eviction of EP300 at the IRF4 super-enhancer and at the ARHGEF12 locus (which is accompanied by minimal eviction of BRD4) in response to SGC-CBP30. In contrast note the robust eviction of only BRD4 at the IgH enhancer (which drives <i>MYC</i> in this cell line) and loci such as CLECL1 in response to CPI203. These data argue that the effects of SGC-CBP30 are not due to global eviction of BRD4, which is observed only with the pure BET inhibitor CPI203."

We have added additional text addressing the assay to the Methods section so as not to distract the reader in the Results section. Consistent with data published in Picaud et al. (Cancer Res. 2015) we did not observe consistent release of chromatin-bound full-length CBP-ZsGreen fusion proteins in response to pharmacologic inhibition or inactivating mutation of the bromodomain. The group at the SGC rectified this problem by fusing three copies of the CBP bromodomain to GFP for FRAP experiments. Our solution was to swap the bromodomain of CBP into the BRD9 scaffold. We found that this domain-swapped fusion protein was released from chromatin only by compounds that showed biochemical engagement of CBP, and that swapping distinct bromodomains into the BRD9 scaffold allowed for chromatin release only with compounds that targeted that specific bromodomain (see our published patent application WO/2014/144303 for reference). While we cannot completely rule out confounding effects of using the chimeric CBP bromodomain in the BRD9 scaffold, our data with the chromatin release assay is complimentary to the BRET assay in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, as well as to the published cellular target engagement assays for SGC-CBP30 and I-CBP112 from the SGC."
