Here, we propose that human observers are capable of generating their own feedback signals by monitoring internal decision variables. We investigated this hypothesis in a visual perceptual learning task using fMRI and confidence reports as a measure for this monitoring process. Employing a novel computational model in which learning is guided by confidence-based reinforcement signals, we found that mesolimbic brain areas encoded both anticipation and prediction error of confidence\u2014in remarkable similarity to previous findings for external reward-based feedback. We demonstrate that the model accounts for choice and confidence reports and show that the mesolimbic confidence prediction error modulation derived through the model predicts individual learning success. These results provide a mechanistic neurobiological explanation for learning without external feedback by augmenting reinforcement models with confidence-based feedback."

Here, we propose that human observers are capable of generating their own feedback signals by monitoring internal decision variables. We investigated this hypothesis in a visual perceptual learning task using fMRI and confidence reports as a measure for this monitoring process. Employing a novel computational model in which learning is guided by confidence-based reinforcement signals, we found that mesolimbic brain areas encoded both anticipation and prediction error of confidence\u2014in remarkable similarity to previous findings for external reward-based feedback. We demonstrate that the model accounts for choice and confidence reports and show that the mesolimbic confidence prediction error modulation derived through the model predicts individual learning success. These results provide a mechanistic neurobiological explanation for learning without external feedback by augmenting reinforcement models with confidence-based feedback."

The behavioral changes arising from learning have quite successfully been described by the reinforcement learning principle (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sutton and Barto, 1998</a>), according to which biological agents continuously adapt their behavior based on the consequences of their actions. Thus, reinforcement learning models and most other learning models depend on feedback from the environment. Yet, there are important instances of learning where no such external feedback is provided, challenging the generality of these learning models in shaping our behavior."

Such <i>perceptual learning</i> has repeatedly been demonstrated to occur without feedback (<a href=\"#bib15\">Herzog and Fahle, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gibson and Gibson, 1955</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">McKee and Westheimer, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Karni and Sagi, 1991</a>) and is therefore ideally suited as a test case to study learning in the absence of external feedback. Previous work has emphasized the role of reinforcement learning in perceptual learning (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kahnt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Law and Gold, 2009</a>). However, these accounts were based on perceptual learning <i>with</i> external feedback and therefore cannot account for instances in which learning occurs <i>without</i> external feedback. Here, we pursued the idea that, in the absence of external feedback, learning is guided by internal feedback processes that evaluate current perceptual information in relation to prior knowledge about the sensory world. We reasoned that introspective reports of perceptual confidence could serve as a window into such internal feedback processes. In this scenario, low or high confidence would correspond to a negative or positive self-evaluation of one\u2019s own perceptual performance, respectively. Accordingly, confidence could act as a teaching signal in the same way as external feedback in normative theories of reinforcement learning (<a href=\"#bib7\">Daniel and Pollmann, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hebart et al., 2014</a>). Applied to the case of perceptual learning, a confidence-based reinforcement signal could serve to strengthen neural circuitry that gave rise to high-confidence percepts and weaken circuitry that led to low-confidence percepts, thereby enhancing the quality of future percepts."

No external feedback was provided; instead, confidence ratings were used as a proxy of internal monitoring processes. To account for perceptual learning in the absence of feedback, we devised a confidence-based associative reinforcement learning model. In the model, confidence prediction errors (<a href=\"#bib7\">Daniel and Pollmann, 2012</a>) serve as teaching signals that indicate the mismatch between the current level of confidence and a running average of previous confidence experiences (expected confidence). Based on recent evidence of confidence signals in the mesolimbic dopamine system (<a href=\"#bib7\">Daniel and Pollmann, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hebart et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Schwarze et al., 2013</a>), we hypothesized to find neural correlates of confidence prediction errors in mesolimbic brain areas such as the ventral striatum and the ventral tegmental area. Since confidence prediction errors act as a teaching signal in our model, we hypothesized that the strength of these mesolimbic confidence signals should be linked to individual perceptual learning success."

Overall, the experiment comprised four sessions: (i) an initial behavioral test session to establish participants\u2019 baseline contrast thresholds for a performance level of 80.35% correct responses, (ii) an intensive perceptual learning session (training) in the MRI scanner with a continuous threshold determination, and two behavioral post-training test sessions to examine (iii)\u00a0short-term and (iv) long-term stimulus-specific training effects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). While the training session was based on one reference axis, all test sessions comprised a contrast threshold determination for both reference axes. The training session additionally included a control condition in interleaved presentation, for which the contrast was kept constant to enable an exploratory multivariate analysis of changes in neural stimulus representation. The Gabor stimuli were flashed briefly in the upper right quadrant and participants had to judge their orientation with respect to the current reference axis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B,C</a>). Eyetracking ensured that participants maintained fixation throughout the training session (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, participants did not receive external cognitive or rewarding feedback during the entire experiment. Rather, in addition to their choice, they reported their confidence about the stimulus orientation on a visual analogue scale (for a verification of accurate usage, see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The confidence reports were used to compute the internal feedback in our model on a trial-by-trial basis."

                                "text": "To account for perceptual learning without external feedback, we devised an associative reinforcement learning model with confidence as internal feedback (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Learning in this model was guided by the combination of a confidence-based reinforcement signal and Hebbian plasticity, inspired by the previously proposed <i>three-factor learning rule</i> (dopaminergic reinforcement signal, pre-synaptic activity, post-synaptic activity) for neural plasticity in the mesolimbic system (<a href=\"#bib33\">Reynolds et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schultz, 2002</a>). Our model assumes that observers improve perceptual performance by optimizing a filter on incoming sensory evidence. The filter is represented by two components: <i>signal weights</i> for clockwise (cw) and counterclockwise (ccw) stimulus orientation (<i>w<sub>ccw</sub></i><sub>,<i>ccw</i></sub>; <i>w<sub>cw</sub></i><sub>,<i>cw</i></sub>), connecting orientation energy detectors <i>E<sub>ccw</sub></i><sub>/<i>cw</i></sub> to decision units <i>A<sub>ccw</sub></i><sub>/<i>cw</i></sub> with same orientations; and <i>noise weights (w<sub>ccw</sub></i><sub>,<i>cw</i></sub>; <i>w<sub>cw</sub></i><sub>,<i>ccw</i></sub>), connecting detectors <i>E<sub>ccw</sub></i><sub>/<i>cw</i></sub> to decision units <i>A<sub>cw</sub></i><sub>/<i>ccw</i></sub> with opposing orientations. The clockwise and counterclockwise orientation energy contained in the stimuli is computed by a simple model of primary visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib30\">Petrov et al., 2005</a>). The weighted sums of <i>E<sub>ccw</sub></i><sub>/<i>cw</i></sub> determine the activities of decision units <i>A<sub>cw</sub></i><sub>/<i>ccw</i></sub> which, in a next step, are integrated in a <i>decision value DV</i> = <i>A<sub>cw</sub></i> \u2212 <i>A<sub>ccw</sub>. DV</i> translates into probabilities for clockwise or counterclockwise choices via a softmax action selection rule, and to the model\u2019s equivalent of confidence\u2014<i>decisional certainty</i>\u2014through its absolute value. Finally, perceptual learning is based on an associative reinforcement learning rule with two separate components: a reinforcement component utilizes a confidence prediction error (CPE; denoted as <i>\u03b4</i>) as internal feedback, representing the mismatch between current confidence and a long-term estimate of expected confidence (via a learning rate <i>\u03b1<sub>c</sub></i>); and a Hebbian component ensures that the weights are updated in proportion to how strongly orientation detectors and decision units co-activate. In addition, a learning rate <i>\u03b1<sub>w</sub></i> accounts for inter-individual differences in learning speed. <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> provides an exemplary time slice of one participant's behavioral reports and accompanying model variables."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, the obtained event-related BOLD time courses are in remarkable agreement with the predictions of the simulation of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and previous empirical findings of reward studies (<a href=\"#bib8\">Delgado et al., 2000</a>). Specifically, 4\u20136 s after <i>trial onset</i> (reflecting the hemodynamic delay), the BOLD time courses exhibited a first peak, consistent with an anticipatory confidence signal at the start of a trial; 4\u20136 s after <i>stimulus onset</i>, the BOLD time courses displayed a positive deflection for high-confidence trials and a negative deflection for low-confidence trials. A statistical analysis confirmed above-baseline striatal activation at trial onset, indicative of an anticipatory signal (left peak at [\u221210 14 \u22126], t<sub>28</sub> = 6.42, p<sub>rFWE</sub> &lt; 0.001; right peak at [12 14 \u22128], t<sub>28</sub> = 7.78, p<sub>rFWE</sub> &lt; 0.001), as well as a main effect of confidence at stimulus onset in the bilateral ventral striatum (left peak at [\u221210\u00a014\u00a0\u22124], t<sub>28</sub> = 10.56, p<sub>rFWE</sub> &lt; 0.001; right peak at [16 12 \u22128], t<sub>28</sub> = 11.46, p<sub>rFWE</sub> &lt; 0.001). This model-free assessment provides initial support for the idea that reinforcement based on reward and based on confidence share a common neural substrate both in the anticipation and the outcome period.

To establish a mechanistic ground for this suggested parallel, we devised an associate reinforcement learning model, which links behavior to computational variables that each account for a different aspect of the learning process. CPEs served as feedback in the model, defined as the difference between the current level of confidence and a long-term estimate of expected confidence. The model successfully described the learning process as a continuous adjustment of a perceptual filter linking sensory and decision units. Our model-based fMRI analyses confirmed and extended the results of the model-free analyses by demonstrating a parametric modulation in mesolimbic brain areas both by expected confidence and confidence prediction. Importantly, the strength of the striatal modulation by CPEs predicted participants\u2019 perceptual improvements, further corroborating the behavioral relevance of these internally-generated feedback signals."

In this framework, the first response is triggered by an outcome-predictive cue and reflects an anticipatory signal. In the case of classical reinforcement learning, such a cue may be probabilistically coupled with rewards of possibly varying magnitudes. The anticipated value of the cue is then assumed to be computed as the average reward magnitude\u2014contingent on the cue\u2014in previous trials (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schultz, 2006</a>). Here, we argue that the same principle could hold for confidence: participants learn to anticipate a certain level of confidence for the upcoming trial based on past confidence experiences, and this anticipatory state is activated when the beginning of a new trial is indicated (equivalent to a cue). In congruence with this postulation, we indeed found a modulation of striatal activity by expected confidence at trial onsets\u2014as previously reported for expected reward (<a href=\"#bib32\">Preuschoff et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Delgado et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Knutson et al., 2001</a>). The second response is triggered by the actual outcome and corresponds to a prediction error signal. In classical reinforcement learning, the reward prediction error represents the difference between expected value and actual outcome. In the confidence domain, the outcome would correspond to the level of confidence calculated from the stimulus and the prediction error would be computed as the difference between expected confidence and actual confidence. Overall, our results may therefore indicate that self-generated confidence assumes the role of external reward in dopaminergic prediction-error-based reinforcement learning when no external feedback is available."

In particular, an fMRI study by Kahnt and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kahnt et al., 2011</a>) investigated perceptual learning with external reward and found that behavioral improvements were well explained by a reinforcement learning model. Their results exhibit a notable parallel to the present findings: the authors reported stimulus information encoded in visual cortex and model-derived decision value in frontal cortices, in agreement with the findings of the present study. In addition, this previous study identified a perceptual learning-related reward prediction error in the ventral striatum, dovetailing with our finding of a perceptual learning-related confidence prediction error in the same brain region. Importantly, our combined Hebbian and reinforcement learning model extends and improves previous models in several ways. First and foremost, by implementing <i>confidence prediction errors</i> in replacement of reward prediction errors, it extends previous reward reinforcement learning models of perceptual learning (<a href=\"#bib27\">Law and Gold, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kahnt et al., 2011</a>) to cases without feedback. Second, these previous models were based on the assumption that perceptual performance is determined by a single 'readout weight', representing the amplification of stimulus information in sensory areas. While the simplicity of these models is appealing, they are limited in the sense that negative prediction errors have an unreasonable influence on behavior: according to these models, worse-than-expected feedback reduces the readout weight, which leads to an additional reduction in performance. This property runs counter to the idea that reinforcement learning agents improve their behavior through both positive and negative prediction errors. By contrast, the <i>associative reinforcement learning rule</i> of the present model entails a behaviorally advantageous and plausible function of negative prediction errors: inhibition of sensory noise. Third, a conceptually related reinforcement learning model for perceptual categorization (<a href=\"#bib7\">Daniel and Pollmann, 2012</a>) implies that stimuli exclusively activate the correct stimulus category, an assumption that disregards the fact that the ambiguity of incoming stimulus information is an essential property of perceptually demanding tasks. In contrast, the present model utilizes a dedicated <i>representational subsystem</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Petrov et al., 2005</a>) to estimate the activation of all implemented input units, and it is their differential activity that determines perceptual choices."

The associative reinforcement learning rule in the model was inspired by the three-factor learning rule (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schultz, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Reynolds et al., 2001</a>), which has been proposed to underlie the potentiation of synapses in the striatum. It proposes that changes in neural transmission in cortico-striatal synapses not only depend on coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity (Hebbian learning), but also on the presence of dopamine error signals. Indeed, Ashby and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ashby et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">H\u00e9lie et al., 2015</a>) have previously suggested that the basal ganglia, which represent the predominant site of dopaminergic synaptic plasticity, are themselves a key region for learning in perceptual tasks. They proposed that (i) the basal ganglia serve to activate the appropriate target regions in executive frontal cortices shortly after sensory cortex activation; and (ii)\u00a0such basal ganglia learning is superseded by cortico-cortical Hebbian learning, once the correct cortico-cortical synapses are built. This account fits well with the present model, in which perceptual learning corresponds to the process of reweighting connections between sensory and decisional units. These considerations in combination with the present results thus lend support to the hypothesis that the optimization of perceptual read-out (as implicated by our model) could be mediated via reinforcement learning in the basal ganglia."

Investigating these questions could clarify whether the observed activity in the reward network is an automatic response or depends on the task of the observer.

In\u00a0other\u00a0words, are they triggered only when participants have to engage in a\u00a0subsequent perceptual choice? Similarly, can these confidence signals be disentangled from choice accuracy, for instance by manipulating stimulus luminance (<a href=\"#bib5\">Busey et al., 2000</a>)?

Participants received the following instruction: \u201cAfter the presentation of the stimulus, a rating scale appears, on which you should indicate how confident you are that your perceived orientation matches the correct orientation of the stimulus. Placing the slider of the rating scale on the thin black end would mean that you have absolutely no confidence in your perceived orientation.

The test sessions were divided into blocks of 16 trials with alternating reference axes and continued until the termination criterion of a staircase procedure was reached. Each block began with a start screen that indicated the reference axis of the upcoming block. The staircase procedure started with a one-up-one-down staircase with a relative stepsize of 0.05 log units to rapidly approximate the rough threshold range (start contrast: <i>c<sub>p\u00a0</sub></i>=\u00a020%; cf. <a href=\"#equ1\">Eq. 1</a>). After three reversals, the algorithm switched to a weighted one-up-two-down staircase (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kaernbach, 1991</a>) for fine-tuning. The ratio of <i>stepsize down / stepsize up</i> was set to 0.5488 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, 1998</a>) with <i>stepsize down</i> set to 0.33%, leading to convergence at a performance of 80.35 percent correct. The termination criterion was the 9th reversal. Thresholds for the horizontal and vertical references axes were independently adjusted. In order to familiarize with the stimulus materials, all participants performed an additional 8 blocks at maximal contrast (<i>c<sub>p\u00a0</sub></i>=\u00a0100%) prior to the pre-test."

Participants performed the adjustment run in the scanner prior to the first training run in order to accommodate with the scanner environment and to fine-tune the initial contrast level for the training runs. The adjustment run started at the determined contrast threshold of the pre-test and was subsequently adapted with the same weighted one-up-one-down staircase procedure used in the test sessions, targeting a performance of 80.35 percent correct. In the critical condition during the training runs, performance was kept constant at 80.35 percent correct by continuously adapting stimulus contrast through the above-described one-up-one-down staircase procedure. The training runs included an additional control condition with constant stimulus contrast in an interleaved half of the trials to permit an assessment of orientation information encoded in activation patterns of visual cortex without the confound of a changing stimulus contrast. The instruction for the response mapping between stimulus orientation (counterclockwise/clockwise) and response button (left/right) was alternated between runs. The response mapping was indicated at the beginning of a run and additionally in each trial through the color (blue/orange) of the fixation cross (the assignment of color and orientation being counterbalanced across participants)."

Inverse Fourier transformation of the power and phase spectrum resulted in a noise field that effectively interfered with the spatial frequency of the Gabor patch. The additive mixture of the Gabor patch and the noise field was multiplied with a circular filter and cropped at a radius of 2.5\u00b0 visual angle, such that the stimulus became circular and smoothly faded out to background luminance. The filter was constructed as the inverse of a two-dimensional 300 x 300 pixel Butterworth low-pass filter of order 7 with cut-off frequency 0.275 cycles / degree visual angle. The value of the cut-off frequency ensured that the fading zone overlapped with the outer border of the Gabor patch and the high order of the filter ensured that the fading zone was relatively steep.

CvMANOVA provides a cross-validated scheme to estimate the distinctness of multivoxel activation patterns and allows analyzing arbitrary estimable contrasts between experimental conditions. To this aim, additional GLMs were estimated for the analysis of orientation energy (OE) and decision value (DV). As for the univariate analyses, both GLMs included regressors for stimulus onset and the response screen, as well as six motion regressors. In case of the OE model, experimental trials across all runs were sorted into three energy tertiles for clockwise (cw) and counterclockwise (ccw) orientation, leading to the following six stimulus onset regressors (orientation/energy): ccw/high, ccw/middle, ccw/low, cw/low, cw/middle, cw/high. For the DV model we used an identical binning procedure, whereby the sign of the DV determined the orientation. As contrast matrices for the cvMANOVA we used [\u22122.5 \u22121.5 \u22120.5 0.5 1.5 2.5] for both OE and DV, i.e., we tested for brain regions exhibiting a linear multivariate relationship with OE or DV. When cvMANOVA was performed as a searchlight analysis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kriegeskorte et al., 2006</a>), spheres with a radius of four voxels (257 voxels) were used."

The vectors were all zeros, except for the trial onset at t = \u22122\u2009s, where the vectors were set to +1, and for the time of stimulus presentation at t = 0\u2009s, where the vectors were set to +1 for positive prediction errors and \u22121 for negative prediction errors. Subsequently, these vectors were convolved with a canonical double-gamma hemodynamic response function provided by SPM8."

For exploratory multivariate analysis, we additionally generated a functional ROI based on the stimulus localizer. In a first step, we computed a group-level functional localizer t-map based on normalized first-level contrast images (<i>stimulus&gt;baseline</i>). After thresholding at p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001, we constricted the localizer-based ROI with a combined anatomical mask of occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</a>). The final ROIs were created in native subject space by intersecting the reverse-normalized localizer t-map and the anatomical mask."

Human subjects were trained on a perceptual-discrimination task that required them to first rate their confidence and then identify whether a Gabor patch was oriented clockwise or counter-clockwise. On average, subjects showed sustained improvements in discrimination ability that were specific to the trained orientation. They modeled behavior in terms of a noisy decision variable. In the model, confidence is scaled from the magnitude of the decision variable and perturbed with Gaussian noise. The difference between the certainty in the choice on that trial and the average certainty across all past trials is used to update the relationship between the orientation energy detectors and the decision variable via an associative learning rule. They found confidence-related signals in the mesolimbic system during training. They conclude that confidence acts in a similar way as an external reward in the context of perceptual learning."

What was the rationale for using this different procedure? What exactly were the instructions to the subjects in terms of reporting their confidence? Moreover, did RT depend systematically on confidence and/or choice accuracy? How much variability was there in the range of confidence values used by individual subjects? Did the particular range used by a given subject affect the confidence-related BOLD signals?

The Discussion states that the results \"fit well with the prediction error hypothesis of dopamine,\" based on responses at two time-points: \"(i) an anticipatory signal triggered by an outcome-predicting cue, and (ii) a surprise signal (prediction error) triggered by the actual outcome.\" However, the results presented here were for what seems like two quite different time points. The first was the encoding of anticipated confidence at the beginning of a trial, but this time point was before any cue was presented that could be used to predict a particular outcome of that trial. The second was the CPE, but this occurred at the time of the stimulus presentation, not the time of \"the actual outcome.\" In this regard, the CPE seems more closely related to either the reward-predicting signal, or perhaps a kind of sensory oddball that would be expected to evoke a different pattern of activation, such as in right inferior prefrontal areas (e.g., Strange et al., 2000). Why were such patterns not measured here? What is the evidence that the stimulus can be thought of as a form of external reward?"

For example, were any measurements taken in the scanner in which the subjects reported only the choice and not the confidence judgment? Such measurements could help characterize the extent to which the confidence-related BOLD signals required the act of reporting the confidence judgment, as opposed to a more inherent, internal representation. Likewise, it might be interesting to consider the effects of manipulating confidence independent of choice accuracy (perhaps via cues that impact confidence rather than choice accuracy such as changing luminance at test see Busey et al., 2000). This should allow one to predict changes in the anticipation and prediction-error signals, independent of choice effects."

An often reported alteration is a confirmation bias, i.e. a tendency to overestimate the confidence in a choice after engaging in that particular choice. Another issue is that the memory trace of the experienced level of confidence could be interfered with by a preceding choice task or simply be attenuated by the prolonged period until the confidence rating. To avoid such issues, we decided to implement a response design in which participants first report their confidence and only subsequently submit the actual choice. An additional advantage of the response design is that participant could \u2018submit\u2019 their selected confidence level and their subsequent choice with a single button press, which was both time-efficient and intuitive.

The first was the encoding of anticipated confidence at the beginning of a trial, but this time point was before any cue was presented that could be used to predict a particular outcome of that trial. The second was the CPE, but this occurred at the time of the stimulus presentation, not the time of \"the actual outcome.\" In this regard, the CPE seems more closely related to either the reward-predicting signal, or perhaps a kind of sensory oddball that would be expected to evoke a different pattern of activation, such as in right inferior prefrontal areas (e.g., Strange et al., 2000). Why were such patterns not measured here? What is the evidence that the stimulus can be thought of as a form of external reward?</i>"

In classical reinforcement learning tasks, observers learn to associate a given cue with certain reward probabilities and magnitudes. In addition, the same cue might also be associated with punishment probabilities and magnitudes. Together, the learned reward and punishment probabilities/magnitudes can be used to compute the overall expected value associated with that particular cue. The point is that in these classical instrumental tasks, expected value often does not refer to a particular outcome, but rather to the anticipated \u201caverage\u201d outcome based on past experiences (Schultz, 2006). Here we argue that the same idea holds for confidence. Participants learn to anticipate a certain level of confidence for the upcoming trial based on past confidence experiences and this anticipatory state is activated when the beginning of a new trial is indicated (equivalent to a cue). In congruence with this postulation, we indeed found a modulation of striatal activity by expected confidence at trial onsets \u2013 just as previously reported for expected reward."

Indeed, our results confirm that striatal activity at the time of stimulus onset was clearly modulated by confidence. Finally, since there was no subsequent feedback phase that could have been anticipated, we would find it difficult to envision why a participant would compute a reward expectation when the stimulus is presented."

The results indeed confirmed that orientation energy accounted only for a small fraction of the variance (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panel A). In addition, we have now added a second analysis, in which we explicitly tested for a modulation by orientation energy (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, new panel C). The reasoning behind this analysis was that orientation energy per se could be a better proxy for the \u201coddballness\u201d of a stimulus presentation compared to the computationally more complex CPE. Using the orientation energy computed by the model as a parametric regressor, we find that the pattern of activations closely matches the results reported by Strange et al.

Although our results confirmed our hypotheses, we acknowledge that fMRI cannot provide causal evidence for a role of confidence-based feedback signals. Such evidence may only be provided by more invasive techniques such as optogenetic stimulation. Outside of the present study, we\u2019d like to note that a recent study (Clos et al., 2015) provided complementary evidence for a similar phenomenology of reward and confidence, demonstrating a close relationship between confidence and the subjective pleasantness associated with a given trial."

This can be exemplary seen in a case, in which a series of high-contrast trials is followed by a low-contrast trial. The high-contrast trials will have rather high levels of confidence and thus the expected confidence will increase. If, for the sake of the example, the subsequent low-contrast stimulus is associated with a surprisingly high confidence (surprising in relation to previous low-contrast trials), an optimal observer would like to trigger a strong learning signal.

Their original reasoning was that perceptual learning could actually be enhanced by such a procedure, because easy trials can serve as templates based on which participants are able to generate internal feedback in more difficult trials. However, they found that perceptual learning in both tasks was abolished. Similar observations have been reported for \u201croving\u201d paradigms with external feedback (Yu et al., 2004; Kuai et al., 2005; Otto et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008; Banai et al., 2010; Tartaglia et al., 2010), which likewise found that perceptual learning is impeded when different stimulus types or difficulties are intermixed. As pointed out by Herzog et al. (2012), these results could point to a reinforcement learning nature of perceptual learning, precisely because of unclear reward prediction error baselines in such heterogeneous task designs. Thus, just as the results of these roving studies can be seen as evidential for a reinforcement learning nature of perceptual learning with external feedback, similar paradigms without external feedback, along the lines suggested by the reviewers, could serve as interesting test cases for the present model."
