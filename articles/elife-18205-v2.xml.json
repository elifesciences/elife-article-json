Using a new class of synthetic click stimuli, we find a robust mapping from temporal sequences in the primary zone to distinct population vectors in secondary auditory areas. We tested whether songbirds could discriminate synthetic click sequences in an operant setup and found that a robust behavioral discrimination is present for click sequences composed of intervals ranging from 11 ms to 40 ms, but breaks down for stimuli composed of longer inter-click intervals. This work suggests that the analog of the songbird auditory cortex transforms temporal patterns to sequence-selective population responses or \u2018spatial codes', and that these distinct population responses contribute to behavioral discrimination of temporally complex sounds."

Using a new class of synthetic click stimuli, we find a robust mapping from temporal sequences in the primary zone to distinct population vectors in secondary auditory areas. We tested whether songbirds could discriminate synthetic click sequences in an operant setup and found that a robust behavioral discrimination is present for click sequences composed of intervals ranging from 11 ms to 40 ms, but breaks down for stimuli composed of longer inter-click intervals. This work suggests that the analog of the songbird auditory cortex transforms temporal patterns to sequence-selective population responses or \u2018spatial codes', and that these distinct population responses contribute to behavioral discrimination of temporally complex sounds."

The core of the auditory processing system consists of anatomical areas named Field L, NCM (caudomedial nidopallium), and CM (caudomedial mesopalium) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Vates et al., 1996</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). These areas and other associated auditory areas are directly and indirectly connected with the song motor pathway (<a href=\"#bib46\">Vates et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2013</a>). Field L, the primary thalamorecipient area, is composed of four different sub-regions (L2a, L2b, L1, and L3) that are reciprocally connected (<a href=\"#bib46\">Vates et al., 1996</a>). Among these sub-regions, L2a receives the strongest input from the core of Ov (nucleus ovoidalis), the primary auditory thalamus (<a href=\"#bib30\">M\u00fcller and Leppelsack, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">R\u00fcbsamen and D\u00f6rrscheidt, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hose et al., 1987</a>). Secondary auditory areas\u00a0\u2014\u00a0L2b, L3, and L1 \u2014\u00a0receive feed-forward input from L2a and thalamus, but also receive feedback from higher cortical areas such as CM. These hierarchically and reciprocally connected auditory areas are thought to be analogous to the early stages of mammalian auditory cortex, but the details of the homologies remain a subject of debate (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jarvis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Calabrese and Woolley, 2015</a>)."

The songbird auditory processing stream is well adapted to this information-processing task and reliably relays temporal information in conspecific song. In the zebra finch auditory system, there are neurons from midbrain to the highest levels of auditory association areas that respond with precise spike times to playback of conspecific song. This is true for both dense-spiking neurons and the highly selective, sparse-firing neurons recently described in the high-level auditory area, NCM (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schneider and Woolley, 2013</a>), as well as in\u00a0the auditory-motor association area, HVC (high vocal center) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Prather et al., 2008</a>). Using a spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) analysis, the effective temporal integration window of neurons in L2a, the first thalamorecipient zone, was observed to be very brief compared with responses one step further from the periphery in areas L1 and L3 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kim and Doupe, 2011</a>). The secondary areas\u00a0(including L2b, L1, and L3) but not the primary zone\u00a0(L2a) are recipients of significant feedback from high-order auditory areas (<a href=\"#bib46\">Vates et al., 1996</a>). In\u00a0combination, the results of these few studies suggest that an interesting transformation of temporal sequences could take place between primary and secondary zones in Field L."

These intervals were drawn from a distribution similar to the intervals between sub-syllabic acoustic transitions in zebra finch song (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gardner et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Amador et al., 2013</a>). For click sequence listening, a distinctive transformation of auditory responses was found between primary and secondary auditory zones. In the primary zone, each click elicited a similar low-latency response in all recorded neurons, and the structure of this response was largely insensitive to the temporal context of the click. One synapse further from the periphery, in secondary auditory areas, L2b and L3, neurons responded asynchronously and selectively, depending on the temporal context of the click. In effect, temporal sequences are transformed to distinct population vectors in the transition from primary to secondary auditory areas. In this process, temporal patterns come to be represented in a format that could directly form the basis of perceptual discriminations based on simple thresholds."

For the click sequences used here, this transformation is even more apparent than for song responses. The diversification of neuronal responses increases the information about the preceding temporal context of a given click that the population vector contains. To demonstrate this, we computed phase-space trajectories of the population vector in response to click sequences, and then quantified the Euclidean distance between these phase-space trajectories. In this analysis, every neuron recorded defines a direction in a phasespace hypercube, and the average firing rate of the cell defines a position along the respective axis."

By contrast, in secondary auditory areas, specific points in the phase-space trajectory diverge from one another in a stimulus-dependent manner. That is, the pattern of cell responses in secondary auditory areas contains information about one or more intervals preceding the click. To summarize simply \u2013 there are particular configurations of active cells that occur only during playback of one stimulus or another \u2014 a useful feature for a system that is tuned to make fine discriminations about temporal sequence patterns."

In this decoding, the discriminability of the sequence at a particular time is given by the distance in phase space to the nearest trajectory belonging to a different stimulus. The power of this \u2018spatial\u2019 code for sequence discrimination is quantified through an ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>. We analyzed coding in primary and secondary areas using the ROC analysis, using a fixed number of single unit recordings (n\u00a0=\u00a010) in both cases. In the secondary auditory areas, but not the primary thalamorecipient area, temporal sequences are mapped onto distinct population patterns, revealing a better sequence decoding in the ROC analysis\u00a0(spike times of the units used in this analysis are also provided in\u00a0<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). We repeated this analysis for just\u00a0the first 500 ms of the stimulus, and still found a high degree of sequence discriminability in the secondary auditory areas (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This shorter analysis is more directly relevant to the behavioral discriminations reported below, as trained birds performing behavioral discriminations typically respond within this time frame (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To further validate this approach, we applied the same analysis to the PSTH of the song syllable responses (n\u00a0=\u00a013 syllables, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>) and found an increase in syllable discriminability in the secondary auditory area (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The fast-click sequences were behaviorally discriminable with high accuracy for a majority of trained birds. Surprisingly, no animals learned to discriminate click sequences that were slowed by a factor of two, even though secondary auditory areas responded with similar spike rates to the slower stimulus. The slowed sequences evoked inter-peak intervals in primary auditory area PSTH that were longer than the typical intervals between peaks in the PSTH during natural song exposure. We suggest that the ascending auditory pathway in the transition from L2a to L2b and L3 is tuned to process temporal events on the faster timescale (11\u201340 ms) in a manner that is particularly useful for song memorization and discrimination."

(High frequency tweeters were used for stimulus delivery limiting the spectral content of each click.) We do not know how the spectral content of the click impacts the behavioral discrimination of the slower sequences. In another prior study, zebra finches were able to discriminate sequences of beeps spaced by intervals of up to 300 ms \u2014 intervals much longer than those used in our study (<a href=\"#bib45\">van der Aa et al., 2015</a>). It is likely that brief clicks and longer tones tap into auditory processing pathways with distinct temporal dynamics, explaining the performance difference. In addition, many details of the temporal discrimination tasks were different in the two studies, and the distinct results may also relate to these task differences. Additional tests will be needed to determine whether or not the spectral content of each click impacts the behavioral performance. Opportunities also exist to further examine the ability of the zebra finch to generalize temporal pattern recognition through time-dilations (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nagel et al., 2010</a>)."

For temporal stimuli composed of identical units such as clicks, intrinsic cellular or circuit mechanisms must bridge intervals of time from one interval to the next in order to create sequence-specific population responses. To encode the history of the stimulus in the present state of the network, synfire chains, avalanches, or more complex transient dynamics in recurrent networks have all been proposed (<a href=\"#bib3\">Abeles, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Grossberg, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Maass et al., 2002</a>).

The\u00a0primary auditory area (L2a) in songbirds reportedly receives no feedback from higher-level auditory zones (<a href=\"#bib46\">Vates et al., 1996</a>), and the synchronous, low-latency responses in this region may reflect a feed-forward response to thalamic drive. By contrast, all other areas, including the secondary auditory zones examined here (L2b and L3), are more densely interconnected both with each other and with higher-level auditory areas. This anatomical distinction raises the possibility that L2b and L3, but not the primary auditory area, L2a, can sustain reverberant activity that could underlie the temporal sequence transformation observed in L2b and L3. Relevant theoretical constructs for this model include liquid state machine theories (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maass et al., 2002</a>). By way of illustration, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> reveals the output of a simple reverberant model that recapitulates key features of the observed dynamics.

A purely feed-forward counter-hypothesis is that the neurons in secondary auditory areas could demonstrate biophysical integration timescales that solve the sequence discrimination through single-cell properties. To illustrate this hypothesis, we first smoothed the click sequences used for behavior training with three different rectangular windows of timescale <math id=\"inf7\"><mi>T</mi></math> or shorter and built phase-plane traces of these hypothetical \u2018smoothing units\u2019 in 3D space. In this case, three different smoothing windows correspond to hypothetical units with different integration timescales. We then analyzed the minimal time-scale <math id=\"inf8\"><mi>T</mi></math> for which the behaviorally trained sequences could be perfectly segregated in the ROC analysis performed earlier for actual neural sequences. From this analysis, we found that phase plane traces used in the behavioral studies can be perfectly separated if the width of the longest rectangular window was 100 ms or greater. To state this more simply, while the sequences presented to the birds were\u00a03\u00a0s long, click rates measured in time bins as short as 100 ms provide a population vector that is adequate for sequence discrimination. This 100 ms timescale cannot rule out either feed-forward single-cell biophysics or recurrent dynamics as contributors to the sequence transformation."

All inside surfaces of the chambers were lined with embossed acoustic foam (PROSPEC Composite, Pinta acoustics inc). Inside each training cage, there were two infrared switches (OPB815WZ, OPTEK Technology): one for trial initiation (called the trial port) and one for water reward (called the water port). The water reservoir was located 24 inches above the cage floor and the water valve (EW-01540\u201302, Cole-Parmer) was placed between the reservoir and spout. The water spout was located in the middle of the infrared switch assembly (water port), so that whenever the bird accessed the water spout, he broke the infrared beam automatically. We used two different sizes of incompressible plastic tubes to make water flow slow enough to\u00a0create a proper drop size (1\u20135 \u03bcl). An illustration of the tubing is shown in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The sound stimulus was presented through the same tweeter used for the electrophysiology study (PLWT4, Pyle Audio). A microprocessor dedicated to each cage (Arduino Mega 2560, Arduino) controlled stimulus presentation, water delivery, and infrared switches. Individual clicks generated by the Arduino microprocessor were 100\u00a0\u03bcs long rectangular pulses. Using this microprocessor, the mean jitter in the click interval was 93\u00a0\u03bcs (data are not shown). Every time the bird tried a new trial, data from the previous trial was transmitted by ethernet to a central data processing computer in the lab and analyzed in real time by a custom made Matlab program (Mathworks, Natick MA, USA). Training ran for five hours per day from Tuesday to Friday each week. The behavior of all birds was monitored through USB webcams in each chamber (Webcam Pro 9000, Logitech)."

Birds learned strategies for the use of both infrared switches through exploration (re-initiating trials within 3 s when the non-rewarded pattern was presented and accessing the water port during playback of the rewarding stimulus, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>)."

We now explain in the manuscript that the sequences used in the behavioral training can be discriminated with smoothing windows on the timescale of 100ms or shorter. As explained in the Discussion, to do this, we first smoothed the click sequences used for behavior training with three different rectangular windows of timescale T or shorter and built phase plane traces of a click sequence in 3D space. In this case, three different smoothing windows correspond to hypothetical units with different integration timescales. We then analyzed in the phase space the minimal time-scale T for which the behaviorally trained sequences could be perfectly segregated. From this analysis, we found that phase plane traces can be separated if the width of rectangular window is greater than 100ms."
