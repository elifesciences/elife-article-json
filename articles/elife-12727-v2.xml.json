                    "text": "Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) allow measurement of activity in large populations of neurons and in small neuronal compartments, over times of milliseconds to months. Although GFP-based GECIs are widely used for in vivo neurophysiology, GECIs with red-shifted excitation and emission spectra have advantages for in vivo imaging because of reduced scattering and absorption in tissue, and a consequent reduction in phototoxicity. However, current red GECIs are inferior to the state-of-the-art GFP-based GCaMP6 indicators for detecting and quantifying neural activity. Here we present improved red GECIs based on mRuby (jRCaMP1a, b) and mApple (jRGECO1a), with sensitivity comparable to GCaMP6. We characterized the performance of the new red GECIs in cultured neurons and in mouse, <i>Drosophila</i>, zebrafish and <i>C. elegans</i> in vivo. Red GECIs facilitate deep-tissue imaging, dual-color imaging together with GFP-based reporters, and the use of optogenetics in combination with calcium imaging."

Although GFP-based GECIs are widely used for in vivo neurophysiology, GECIs with red-shifted excitation and emission spectra have advantages for in vivo imaging because of reduced scattering and absorption in tissue, and a consequent reduction in phototoxicity. However, current red GECIs are inferior to the state-of-the-art GFP-based GCaMP6 indicators for detecting and quantifying neural activity. Here we present improved red GECIs based on mRuby (jRCaMP1a, b) and mApple (jRGECO1a), with sensitivity comparable to GCaMP6. We characterized the performance of the new red GECIs in cultured neurons and in mouse, <i>Drosophila</i>, zebrafish and <i>C. elegans</i> in vivo. Red GECIs facilitate deep-tissue imaging, dual-color imaging together with GFP-based reporters, and the use of optogenetics in combination with calcium imaging."

GCaMPs are difficult to use in transgenic animals that already express other GFP-based proteins. The blue excitation light used in standard wide-field microscopy can cause photodamage and is highly scattered in tissue. The green GCaMP emission is absorbed by blood (<a href=\"#bib44\">Svoboda and Block, 1994</a>), which reduces the penetration depth of imaging in vertebrates in vivo. In addition, the GCaMP excitation spectrum overlaps with those of light-sensitive ion channels, including channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nagel et al., 2003</a>), which complicates the simultaneous use of green GECIs and optogenetics. Red-shifted GECIs thus promise three main advantages over GFP-based sensors: increased maximal imaging depth, parallel use of a red GECI with light-sensitive ion channels for all-optical neurophysiology experiments, and reduced photodamage. In addition, together with existing green GECIs, red GECIs allow simultaneous imaging of multiple components of neuronal circuitry."

Two-photon excitation was performed with a tunable ultrafast laser (Insight DS+; Spectra-Physics) running at 1040 nm or 1100 nm. L2/3 neurons showed red fluorescence in the neuronal cytoplasm. Visual stimuli consisted of moving gratings presented in eight directions to the contralateral eye (<a href=\"#bib3\">Akerboom et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>).

We expressed jRGECO1a, jRCaMP1a, and jRCaMP1b for more than 130 days in mouse V1. Unlike GCaMP indicators, nuclear filling was not observed (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>), presumably due to the NES in the red GECI sequences. Red GECIs showed stable performance over time, although a small decrease of orientation selectivity was observed for jRCaMP1b after 180 days of expression (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2b\u2013d</a>).

Similar punctae were also found in cultured neurons, but were less numerous (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p&lt;0.001, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>).

Current state-of-the-art green GECIs, such as GCaMP6, have sufficient sensitivity to detect single action potentials in diverse cell types and even detect activity of single synapses. They can be targeted to specific cell types and subcellular compartments. Red GECIs can potentially be used in a similar manner with additional advantages. For example, they suffer less from tissue scattering and absorption. In addition, rhodopsin-based optogenetic tools have substantial absorption in the blue region of the wavelength spectrum, which overlaps with the excitation spectrum of GFP. Red GECIs can be imaged without exciting ChR2. We developed red GECIs that rival best-of-class green GECIs in terms of sensitivity for detecting neural activity, thereby closing a significant performance gap between red and green GECIs."

First, all tested red GECIs show smaller (3- to 4-fold less) maximal fluorescence changes upon calcium binding than the GCaMP6 indicators. This limits the overall dynamic range of red GECIs. Second, the relatively low absorption cross-section of the red GECIs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) further reduces the achievable signal-to-noise ratio for in vivo imaging. Third, red GECIs show complex intracellular behavior, such as accumulation in lysosomes (jRGECO1a) with long-term expression in the mouse brain. The presence of green fluorescence in all tested GECIs suggests the existence of multiple protein species, some of which do not produce functional signals (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4s3\">3</a>). These issues seem to be related to the red fluorescent protein component of the sensor (see, for example, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> in <a href=\"#bib8\">Cai et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, engineering red GECIs to produce less non-productive fluorescence might require replacing or re-engineering the RFP itself (<a href=\"#bib29\">Moore et al., 2012</a>), a direction that we plan to pursue in the future."

Absorption spectra were taken on a UV/VIS spectrometer (Lambda 35, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra were measured on a LS-55 fluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer) with 5 nm slits, and excitation/emission wavelengths of 555\u00a0nm/600\u00a0nm. Absolute quantum yields were measured using a Quantaurus-QY integrating-sphere spectrometer (model C11374, Hamamatsu, Japan). Dim solutions (<i>e.g.</i> jRGECO1a or GCaMP6s in EGTA buffer) were not measurable on the Quantaurus, so relative quantum yields were determined from measured absorption in the UV/VIS spectrometer and integrated fluorescence measured in the fluorimeter, in comparison to the reference fluorophores mCherry (measured absolute QY of 0.22) or fluorescein (QY =0.93 in pH 9.5 borate buffer) for either red or green GECIs. Extinction coefficients for RGECO variants were determined using the alkali denaturation method, assuming the denatured extinction coefficient for RGECO variants is the same as denatured mCherry, 37,000\u2009M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup> at 455 nm at pH 13 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>). For RCaMP variants, the denatured absorption spectra is complicated by an absorbance peak at 383 nm that first appears with increasing pH at pH 11.5, and is irreversibly formed. So for RCaMP variants we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), described below, to quantify concentration by counting fluorophores (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haustein and Schwille, 2003</a>), using mCherry as a concentration reference. FCS was performed on 10\u2013100 nM protein solutions using 1060 nm excitation at low laser power (1\u20133 mW) to determine the autocorrelation function G(\u03c4) of the fluorescence signal. The number of fluorophores inside the beam volume is found from 1/G(0). The beam volume was found from identical FCS measurements on the reference protein mCherry at known concentration. For consistency, jRGECO variants were measured using the two methods and results were similar."

It consists of structure-guided mutagenesis of the indicator proteins, followed by a neuronal screening assay using field stimulation to elicit action potential firing. Screening was followed by a careful and detailed characterization of the new probes in several model organisms in vivo."

If so, it would be useful to see a time course of green species expression profiles in vivo after viral gene delivery. This could help users to find a suitable time window that offers best conditions for their experiments.</i>We now show that jRGECO1a (but not jRCaMP1a/b) accumulates in lysosomes and that this phenomenon is more pronounced during long-term expression in vivo compared to cultured neurons. We also show that this accumulation contributes to lower response amplitudes (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1). In addition we added a more detailed characterization of the greenish emission and the change of the jRGECO1a greenish component with time, as the reviewers suggested (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3)."

G-CaMP6s appears to clearly outperform jRGECO1 in layer 2/3 neurons of mouse visual cortex, whereas at the Drosophila NMJ preparation, jRGECO1 overall appears to do better than GCaMP6s. Given that the NMJ prep has essentially no tissue covering the boutons the brighter green GCaMP6s should have an easy game while in layer 2/3 mouse cortex the higher penetration of red light might favor jRGECO1. Why is this not the case?</i> We agree that the red sensors responses in the mouse cortex are lower than what is expected based on the cultured cells assay results. The <i>Drosophila</i> NMJ data is similar to the cultured neuron data, and the mouse V1 data appears to be the exception here. The sources of the reduced V1 performance were studied (see response above) and are now presented in Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1-3, and mentioned in the Discussion. Multiple mechanisms might contribute, including non-productive fluorescence in lysosomes and non-productive green species."
