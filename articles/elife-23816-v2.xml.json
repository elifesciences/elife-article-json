                    "text": "The tubular network is a critical part of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The network is shaped by the reticulons and REEPs/Yop1p that generate tubules by inducing high membrane curvature, and the dynamin-like GTPases atlastin and Sey1p/RHD3 that connect tubules via membrane fusion. However, the specific functions of this ER domain are not clear. Here, we isolated tubule-based microsomes from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> via classical cell fractionation and detergent-free immunoprecipitation of Flag-tagged Yop1p, which specifically localizes to ER tubules. In quantitative comparisons of tubule-derived and total microsomes, we identified a total of 79 proteins that were enriched in the ER tubules, including known proteins that organize the tubular ER network. Functional categorization of the list of proteins revealed that the tubular ER network may be involved in membrane trafficking, lipid metabolism, organelle contact, and stress sensing. We propose that affinity isolation coupled with quantitative proteomics is a useful tool for investigating ER functions."

The network is shaped by the reticulons and REEPs/Yop1p that generate tubules by inducing high membrane curvature, and the dynamin-like GTPases atlastin and Sey1p/RHD3 that connect tubules via membrane fusion. However, the specific functions of this ER domain are not clear. Here, we isolated tubule-based microsomes from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> via classical cell fractionation and detergent-free immunoprecipitation of Flag-tagged Yop1p, which specifically localizes to ER tubules. In quantitative comparisons of tubule-derived and total microsomes, we identified a total of 79 proteins that were enriched in the ER tubules, including known proteins that organize the tubular ER network. Functional categorization of the list of proteins revealed that the tubular ER network may be involved in membrane trafficking, lipid metabolism, organelle contact, and stress sensing. We propose that affinity isolation coupled with quantitative proteomics is a useful tool for investigating ER functions."

In this network, tubules constantly form, retract, move, and fuse with one another (<a href=\"#bib18\">Du et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Griffing, 2010</a>). The abundance of the tubular network varies between different cell types. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, electron microscope (EM) tomography has revealed that\u00a0~30% of the ER is composed of the tubular network (<a href=\"#bib59\">West et al., 2011</a>). In mammalian cells, the tubular ER network is more prominent in cell lines, including COS-7 and U2OS cells. The distribution of the network also varies. In yeast and plant cells, the tubular ER is mostly found beneath the plasma membrane, a region termed the cortical ER (<a href=\"#bib27\">Griffing, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Prinz et al., 2000</a>). In mammalian cells, ER tubules are frequently found in the cell periphery, but there is usually a cluster of tubules in the perinuclear region (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baumann and Walz, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shibata et al., 2006</a>). The abundance and distribution of the tubular ER network is tightly regulated in the cell."

Such curvature is generated and stabilized by a class of integral membrane proteins, the reticulons (RTNs) and DP1/Yop1p (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Voeltz et al., 2006</a>). Deletion of these proteins causes a loss of tubules and a corresponding gain in sheets, and purified reconstituted Yop1p and Rtn1p generate tubules in vitro (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hu et al., 2008</a>). The most conserved region of these proteins is the reticulon homology domain (RHD) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shibata et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Voeltz et al., 2006</a>), which contains two tandem transmembrane (TM) segments. Each of these segments consists of 30\u201335 amino acids, which is too long to traverse the membrane once but too short to traverse it twice; therefore, they likely form transmembrane hairpins (TMHs). The hairpin-like configuration occupies more space in the outer leaflet than the inner leaflet and may bend the membrane. In addition, these tubule-forming proteins form homo- or hetero-oligomers (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shibata et al., 2008</a>), which could serve as curved scaffolds. ER tubules can also be pulled out from a flat membrane by either attaching to the growing tip of the microtubule or interacting with motor proteins (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shibata et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zimmerberg and Kozlov, 2006</a>). In these cases, the tip of a newly formed tubule is often marked by Rab10 in complex with phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS) and CEPT1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">English and Voeltz, 2013</a>)."

Fusion between tubules is mediated by a class of dynamin-like GTPase, atlastin (ATL) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hu and Rapoport, 2016</a>). Depletion of ATL results in an unbranched ER phenotype (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rismanchi et al., 2008</a>), and purified and reconstituted <i>Drosophila</i> ATL fuses vesicles in vitro (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bian et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Orso et al., 2009</a>). No ATL is found in yeast, but a functional ortholog, Sey1p, has been identified. ATL and Sey1p are exchangeable in the maintenance of ER morphology in cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anwar et al., 2012</a>). Structural and biochemical analysis has revealed that GTP binding induces dimerization, and hydrolysis-driven conformational changes are important for the fusion by ATL and Sey1p (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bian et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Byrnes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Byrnes and Sondermann, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yan et al., 2015</a>). Both GTPases contain a TMH near the C-terminus that interacts with the RHD of tubule-forming proteins and facilitates the localization of these ER fusogens in the tubular ER (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hu et al., 2009</a>)."

Sey1p is the only well-characterized ER fusogen in yeast, and three ATLs have been identified in mammals (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rismanchi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhu et al., 2003</a>). Deletion of these key ER-shaping proteins has revealed the importance of the tubular ER network. Loss of Rtns and Yop1p in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> results in retarded growth (<a href=\"#bib58\">Voeltz et al., 2006</a>), and in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> it significantly decreases the embryo survival rate (<a href=\"#bib2\">Audhya et al., 2007</a>). Deletion of Sey1p in <i>Candida albicans</i> results in decreased virulence (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yamada-Okabe and Yamada-Okabe, 2002</a>). Deletion or mutation of RHD3, a homolog of Sey1p in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, yields short root hairs and severe growth defects (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>).

In humans, mutations in ATL1 cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a neurodegenerative disease (<a href=\"#bib49\">Salinas et al., 2008</a>).

Though proteins important for sheet formation have been revealed by comparative analysis of rough microsomes (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shibata et al., 2010</a>), the proteome of ER tubules has yet to be reported. Here, we isolated tubular ER via immunoprecipitation against a tubule-specific marker. Quantitative proteomic analysis by isotope-labeling mass spectrometry revealed 79 proteins that are enriched in tubular ER. These findings suggest specific roles of the tubular ER network and provide important tools for further functional studies of ER tubules."

Yop1p marks the tubular ER network (<a href=\"#bib58\">Voeltz et al., 2006</a>) and Sec63p, a component of the translocon-associated complex, marks the entire ER. To test whether the presence of these ectopically expressed proteins compromises ER health, we monitored the unfolded protein response (UPR) in transformed cells. No obvious HAC1 (an UPR-regulated transcription activator) processing or Kar2p (an ER luminal chaperone) upregulation, commonly used indicators of the UPR in yeast (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cox and Walter, 1996</a>), was observed (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>).

Some of the ER proteins, such as Kar2p and Sey1p, co-precipitated.

As expected, Yop1p signals appeared in the same fractions (3\u20139) as in experiments when total microsomes were tested. The residual Sec63p-HA signals co-migrated with Yop1p and were devoid of the high-density region (12\u201315). We further analyzed TO and TU microsomes using negative-stain EM.

Similarly, proteins with a large ratio of TU:BL (&gt;1) are likely specifically precipitated by anti-Flag beads and related to tubular microsomes. Thus, proteins with both ratios above the thresholds can be considered putative constituents of ER tubules. We performed a quantitative\u00a0proteomic analysis using the dimethyl isotope labeling technique to compare the proteome profiles between these three types of samples (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The relative TU:TO and TU:BL ratios were determined for proteins from biological triplicates (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). A total of 845 proteins were identified with a quantifiable TU:TO ratio, and 531 were identified with a TU:BL ratio (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Reproducibility was demonstrated by the median CV% of protein ratio measurements across biological triplicates (17.5% for proteins with TU:TO ratios and 18.5% for proteins with TU:BL ratios).

Full list of protein identification and quantification with statistics is summarized in source data 1 and 2. A total of 466 proteins were quantified in both TU:TO and TU:BL comparative experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To isolate candidates for the tubular ER, we retained 231 proteins with an average TU:TO ratio\u00a0&gt;2.0 (p&lt;0.05).

Less stringent criteria (p&lt;0.1 instead of 0.05) were employed for candidates with 2.0\u00a0&gt;\u00a0TU:BL ratio\u00a0&gt;1.4, considering the inclusion of proteins that may weakly associate with ER tubules. Most proteins with an average TU:BL ratio\u00a0&lt;1.4 were highly abundant cytosolic enzymes or ribosomal proteins and discarded due to their non-specific association with the Flag affinity gel beads.

In addition to proteins known to shape the tubular network, including Rtn1p, Rtn2p, Yop1p, and Sey1p, we discovered proteins that function mainly in vesicle-based trafficking, membrane contact formation, lipid synthesis, or ER-related signaling. These findings emphasize the communication role of ER tubules, as they are the most outward reaching part of the organelle.

Thus, curvature-sensitive functions or localization are expected for ER tubule-enriched proteins. For example, vesicle budding has been speculated to benefit from the membrane curvature observed in ER tubules. In yeast cells, most of the COPII vesicles, which transport cargo from the ER to Golgi, form in the tubular ER (<a href=\"#bib45\">Okamoto et al., 2012</a>). In addition, proteins residing in ER tubules often possess membrane-anchoring motifs that prefer high curvature (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang and Hu, 2016</a>). These motifs include TMH, such as in RTNs or REEP/Yop1p proteins, or an amphipathic helix (APH) that may insert easily into a curved membrane and is found in many of the proteins identified here."

Such roles are expected as the tubular network is broadly distributed in the cell. Tricalbin proteins Tcb1p (TU:TO 2.49; TU:BL 1.57), Tcb2p (TU:TO 3.30; TU:BL 1.72), and Tcb3p (TU:TO 2.37; TU:BL 3.40) are homologs of extended synaptotagmins in mammals, which localize in the ER and associate with the PM (<a href=\"#bib57\">Toulmay and Prinz, 2012</a>). Scs2p (TU:TO 4.01; TU:BL 3.19), a homolog of VAP-A, is also known for ER-PM contact (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kim et al., 2015</a>). Another example of a contact protein residing in the ER tubule is YPR091C (TU:TO 4.07; TU:BL 3.37). It was renamed Nvj2p for its localization between the nucleus and vacuole (<a href=\"#bib57\">Toulmay and Prinz, 2012</a>) and was recently found to form an inducible contact with Golgi (<a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2017</a>). The existence of TMH in both Tcb proteins and Nvj2p is consistent with their commitment to ER tubules."

                                "text": "Lipid synthesis has long been thought to be the major role of smooth ER, which includes most of the tubular ER. We identified proteins that are related to several aspects of lipid synthesis, including enzymes along the ergosterol biogenesis pathway. Erg9p (TU:TO 4.60; TU:BL 2.57), or squalene synthase, acts in the earlier steps (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jennings et al., 1991</a>), whereas Erg26p (TU:TO 3.61; TU:BL 3.34) and Erg27p (TU:TO 4.28; TU:BL 1.58) play roles in the later steps (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gachotte et al., 1998</a>). Members of the conserved ER membrane protein complex (EMC) were also identified, including EMC1 (TU:TO 3.19; TU:BL 2.07), EMC2 (TU:TO 2.73; TU:BL 1.84), and EMC4 (TU:TO 2.34; TU:BL 1.58), the function of which are yet to be identified but likely related to lipid synthesis and/or transfer (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lahiri et al., 2014</a>). Finally, transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism were among the candidate proteins. Yet1p (TU:TO 2.44; TU:BL 2.67) and Yet3p (TU:TO 2.42; TU:BL 2.74) physically interact with Scs2p and the transcriptional repressor Opi1p (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wilson et al., 2011</a>). The resulting complex plays a key regulatory role during inositol starvation. The ERG proteins contain predicted hydrophobic segments that may potentially behave as TMHs. Some of these proteins may also be targeted to the tubular ER by APHs. Alternatively, intermediates of lipid synthesis may favor the curved environment provided by the tubular ER network."

Additional stresses sensed by ER tubules that are inferred from our results include DNA integrity and chromatin structure (Msc1p, Bmh2p, Yim1p, Scp160p) and oxidation (Zta1p). ER tubules may also associate with acidic stress, as inferred from the quantification data of Yro2p (TU:TO 2.49, TU:BL 3.17), though the p-value for its TU:TO ratio (0.078) was beyond the cut-off (0.05).

Nevertheless, certain candidates may have been missed due to a failure of ratio determination, that\u00a0is, proteins are present in the TU but barely detected in the TO or BL. Additional candidates, especially proteins with low abundance, may be identified through extra replicates. Some ER tubule-based microsomes, likely tethered to other heavy membranes, may be lost during early purification steps. For example, the ER-mitochondria contact is mainly mediated by the ER mitochondrial encounter structure (ERMES) complex (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kornmann et al., 2009</a>) and occurs predominantly in ER tubules (<a href=\"#bib23\">Friedman and Voeltz, 2011</a>). Thus, the ER-localized ERMES component Mmm1p would be enriched in ER tubules, but it was not found in our list. To expand the inventory of ER tubule proteins, tubular marker-containing microsomes can be attempted to be isolated from total lysates."

Next, 4 \u03bcL of formaldehyde (CH<sub>2</sub>O, CD<sub>2</sub>O, and <sup>13</sup>CD<sub>2</sub>O, 4%, v/v) was added to specific samples for differential isotope labeling. The same volume of fresh 0.6 M cyanoborohydride (NaBH<sub>3</sub>CN) was added to the light and intermediate labeled peptides, and the labeled NaBD<sub>3</sub>CN added to the heavy labeled peptides. After incubation for 1 hr at room temperature, 16 \u03bcL of 1% ammonium solution was added and vortexed for 10 min. Finally, 8 \u03bcL of 5% formic acid was added to quench the reaction.

The Uniprot <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> protein database (Jul-2013, 6629 entries) supplemented with the trypsin sequence and common protein contaminant sequences was employed. In the software algorithm, all modifications listed in UniMod are searched simultaneously with the tolerance specified as\u00a0\u00b10.05 Da for peptides and MS/MS fragments (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shilov et al., 2007</a>). ProteinPilot automatically clusters identified proteins into protein groups sharing common peptides. Only proteins identified with\u00a0&gt;99% confidence were retained, resulting in an FDR\u00a0&lt;\u00a01% as calculated by a decoy database search. Dimethyl labeling was specified as the quantification method. Only peptides with unique sequences (not shared with other proteins) and free of miscleavage or variable modifications contributed to the protein ratio calculation. According to our isotopic labeling design, the relative TU:TO or TU:BL ratio for each identified protein was measured in triplicate and the average ratio and standard deviation calculated (full data in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Two-tailed t-tests were performed to determine p-values for the statistical deviation of individual protein ratios from unity. Proteins in pairwise comparisons of TU:TO and TU:BL were considered significantly up-regulated if the ratio was\u00a0&gt;2.0 and p&lt;0.05.

Quantitative proteomics is then used to identify other proteins enriched in this tubular ER prep. Starting with approximately 485 proteins that are readily detected in their microsome prep, 80 proteins were significantly enriched through Yop1 immunoisolation methods. The list of 80 proteins includes known tubular ER proteins (e.g. reticulons) and other candidates that may be involved in the structure/function of tubular ER. Overall this is a data-driven study that is straightforward and combines membrane isolation with quantitative proteomics. However, we have a number of specific concerns that you will need to satisfy if this work to be published in <i>eLife</i>. Regarding significance, it seems less clear how broadly applicable the method will be to other research labs. Cataloging the proteins that are enriched in tubular ER should be a useful resource."

Indeed, one of the main characteristics of specific TU-ER proteins, such as the reference proteins Rtn1,2p, Sey1p, and Yop1p, is their exclusion from the flat membranes of the NE. The authors should visually verify the absence of their TU-ER candidates from the NE in yeast cells. If the proteins indeed localize to the NE as reported elsewhere, it would be difficult to understand how these candidates could have been found to be enriched in the TU-ER."

One issue that may be of relevance to the community using the methodology is the reliability of the reproducibility of the methodology. It may be safer for the authors to report on n=3 biological replicates for each set of data (mass spec and westerns). It appears that technical replicates have been mixed in with biological replicates. Having n=3 biological replicates for all data would assure the community of reproducibility. The technical replicate issue simply tests the authors' mass spec and Western blot platforms that are not expected to vary much when samples are run on them at the same time. However, the subtleties of homogenization and responses of different biological replicates of cells (yeast and mammalian) to protein expression will vary and why biological replicates may be useful for the community."

Indeed, one of the main characteristics of specific TU-ER proteins, such as the reference proteins Rtn1,2p, Sey1p, and Yop1p, is their exclusion from the flat membranes of the NE. The authors should visually verify the absence of their TU-ER candidates from the NE in yeast cells. If the proteins indeed localize to the NE as reported elsewhere, it would be difficult to understand how these candidates could have been found to be enriched in the TU-ER.</i>"

Though some proteins, such as Yop1p and Rtn1p, have strong preference for curved membranes and are less likely to reside in the NE, other proteins may interact with TU-exclusive proteins and be enriched in the tubular ER. In the latter case, these proteins may very likely enter the NE when they are not bound to TU-exclusive proteins. For example, the mammalian homolog of Pom33p (identified in our list, interacts with Rtn1p) clearly localizes to both the tubular ER and the NE (PubMed IDs: 25612671 and 26268696), and Sey1p has been found in the NE to regulate nuclear pore complex integrity (PubMed ID: 26041935). Furthermore, low levels of TU-exclusive proteins can be seen in the NE of yeast cells (16469703), possibly existing in highly curved membranes around nuclear pores."
