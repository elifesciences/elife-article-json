DEER measurements on the heterodimeric ABC exporter TM287/288 from <i>Thermotoga maritima</i>, which contains a non-canonical ATP binding site, revealed that in the presence of nucleotides the transporter exists in an IF/OF equilibrium. While ATP binding was sufficient to partially populate the OF state, nucleotide trapping in the pre- or post-hydrolytic state was required for a pronounced conformational shift. At physiologically high temperatures and in the absence of nucleotides, the NBDs disengage asymmetrically while the conformation of the TMDs remains unchanged. Nucleotide binding at the degenerate ATP site prevents complete NBD separation, a molecular feature differentiating heterodimeric from homodimeric ABC exporters. Our data suggest hydrolysis-independent closure of the NBD dimer, which is further stabilized as the consensus site nucleotide is committed to hydrolysis."

DEER measurements on the heterodimeric ABC exporter TM287/288 from <i>Thermotoga maritima</i>, which contains a non-canonical ATP binding site, revealed that in the presence of nucleotides the transporter exists in an IF/OF equilibrium. While ATP binding was sufficient to partially populate the OF state, nucleotide trapping in the pre- or post-hydrolytic state was required for a pronounced conformational shift. At physiologically high temperatures and in the absence of nucleotides, the NBDs disengage asymmetrically while the conformation of the TMDs remains unchanged. Nucleotide binding at the degenerate ATP site prevents complete NBD separation, a molecular feature differentiating heterodimeric from homodimeric ABC exporters. Our data suggest hydrolysis-independent closure of the NBD dimer, which is further stabilized as the consensus site nucleotide is committed to hydrolysis."

Transport processes mediated by more than forty human ABC exporters fulfil vital functions in our body as they translocate an extraordinarily wide range of cargoes such as lipids, peptides, ions and drugs across lipid bilayers. A number of severe hereditary diseases including cystic fibrosis and insulin secretion disorders such as neonatal diabetes and hyperinsulinism are directly linked to ABC transporter malfunction (CFTR and SUR1, respectively), underpinning their paramount importance in human health (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aittoniemi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gadsby et al., 2006</a>). The human ABC exporters P-glycoprotein, ABCG2 and MRP1 act as multidrug efflux pumps in tumors and hamper effective cancer treatment (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gottesman et al., 2016</a>). The same transporters have received increasing attention in past years, playing a central role in the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of pharmaceuticals in the human body (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nigam, 2015</a>). In addition, ABC exporters play a major physiological role in the transport of metabolites such as urate, glucuronides and N-lactoyl-amino acids (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jansen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Krumpochova et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Woodward et al., 2009</a>)."

NBDs are called \u2018closed\u2019 when they sandwich two ATP molecules at their head-to-tail dimer interface or \u2018open\u2019 when they are partially or completely disengaged from each other. The NBDs are coupled to the TMDs via two main and two accessory coupling helices (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dawson and Locher, 2006</a>). When the NBDs are disengaged, the TMDs adopt an IF state (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ward et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, the TMDs adopt an outward-facing or outward-occluded state when the NBDs are closed (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dawson and Locher, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Choudhury et al., 2014</a>). Transport across the membrane requires binding of a substrate\u00a0to the inward-facing cavity, NBD closure and transition to the OF state and substrate release. The outward-occluded state is a possible intermediate in the cycle. An affinity switch is a prerequisite for uphill transport of substrates, namely substrates need to bind with higher affinity to the inward-facing transporter than to the outward-facing transporter (<a href=\"#bib18\">Higgins and Linton, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sauna and Ambudkar, 2007</a>). Deviations from this general substrate pathway exist for ABCA4, which in fact imports N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine (i.e. an inverse affinity switch must exist) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Quazi et al., 2012</a>) and for ABC exporters transporting substrates which are too large to be accommodated in the cavity as it is proposed for PglK transporting lipid-linked oligosaccharides (<a href=\"#bib39\">Perez et al., 2015</a>)."

In the prevalent ATP-switch model postulated by Higgins and co-workers, ATP binding leads to NBD closure and a concomitant switch from the IF to the OF state (<a href=\"#bib18\">Higgins and Linton, 2004</a>). ATP hydrolysis then destabilizes the NBD dimer and the transporter reverts to its IF state with disengaged NBDs. In the ATP-switch model, ATP hydrolysis is not required for substrate release; the entire transport reaction of a substrate is coupled to ATP binding to the NBD sandwich dimer and the role of ATP hydrolysis is to recharge the machinery for the next ATP binding and substrate transport reaction. Detailed studies on ABCB1 have emphasized the importance of asymmetric occlusion of one nucleotide to trigger the affinity switch and thus substrate release, which challenged the ATP-switch model. Nucleotide occlusion is achieved by beryllium fluoride and vanadate trapping of ADP (representing the pre- and post-hydrolysis states, respectively), the substitution of the Walker B glutamate to glutamine or alanine (trapping a pre-transition state of the nucleotides) and in the presence of the slowly hydrolyzable analog ATP\u03b3S (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sauna and Ambudkar, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sauna et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2007</a>)."

When crystallized in the absence of nucleotides (apo), all ABC exporter structures depict IF states with partially or fully separated NBDs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ward et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hohl et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kodan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2014</a>). Since nucleotide-free conditions do not exist in living cells, apo structures represent very rare events of the transport cycle, i.e. the exchange of two nucleotides at the same time. Most ABC exporter structures crystallized in the presence of nucleotides exhibit closed NBDs and adopt outward-occluded or outward-facing configurations of the TMDs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dawson and Locher, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Choudhury et al., 2014</a>). Exceptions are inward-facing ABCB10 (with two AMP-PCP bound) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Shintre et al., 2013</a>) and TM287/288 (with one AMP-PNP bound to the degenerate site) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hohl et al., 2012</a>). In agreement with the ATP-switch model, the majority of the ABC exporters with closed NBDs have been crystallized with the ATP analogs AMP-PNP and ATP\u03b3S (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ward et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Choudhury et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dawson and Locher, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lin et al., 2015</a>). However, in the structures of Sav1866 and PglK, closed NBD dimers with bound ADP were observed (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dawson and Locher, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Perez et al., 2015</a>); according to the ATP-switch model these NBDs are expected to be separated. So far, no asymmetries in closed NBDs of full-length ABC exporter structures have been reported. Hence, structural evidence for asymmetric nucleotide occlusion as it has been proposed based on biochemical studies of ABCB1 is still missing. Accordingly, there is no crystallographic data in support of the constant contact model, which in contrast to the ATP-switch model posits that one of the nucleotide binding sites always remains bridged by at least one sandwiched nucleotide (<a href=\"#bib14\">George and Jones, 2012</a>)."

Besides computational molecular dynamics simulations, pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques have been widely used as an experimental method to study frozen snapshots of conformational ensembles of ABC exporters. In particular, the homodimeric lipid A transporter MsbA has been studied in great detail by double electron electron resonance (DEER) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Borbat et al., 2007</a>). The surprisingly large conformational changes between the apo and nucleotide-bound states as they were observed in the various MsbA crystal structures (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ward et al., 2007</a>) could be confirmed by DEER in detergent solution and in proteoliposomes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mittal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zou et al., 2009</a>). Both binding of AMP-PNP-Mg and trapping of ADP-vanadate, representing the pre- and the post-hydrolytic state, respectively, were sufficient for NBD closure and complete transition to the outward-facing configuration of the TMDs, supporting the ATP-switch model\u2019s key notion that ATP binding and not ATP hydrolysis drives the IF to OF transition. In a recent study, single particle electron microscopy (EM) was used to delineate the conformational trajectory of MsbA (<a href=\"#bib35\">Moeller et al., 2015</a>). In agreement with the crystal structures and DEER studies, large separation between the NBDs in the absence of nucleotides was observed. Interestingly, the method allowed for detection of poorly populated states and revealed that even in the absence of nucleotides a small fraction of the MsbA adopts an OF state. The fraction of outward-facing MsbA was increased up to 95% in the presence of ATP-Mg-vanadate, but in contrast to the DEER studies reached only 41% in the presence of AMP-PNP-Mg."

A hallmark of BmrCD and many other heterodimeric ABC exporters is the so-called degenerate ATP binding site, which binds ATP tightly but is catalytically impaired (<a href=\"#bib2\">Basso et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Procko et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tsai et al., 2010</a>). TM287/288 from the thermophilic bacterium <i>Thermotoga maritima</i> is currently the only heterodimeric ABC exporter encompassing a degenerate nucleotide binding site for which crystal structures are available. The TM287/288 structures were solved in the presence of AMP-PNP-Mg and in the apo state, respectively (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hohl et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">2014</a>). Both structures are inward-facing and exhibit differences mainly at the D-loops, which were shown to establish functionally crucial cross-talk between the asymmetric binding sites (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hohl et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Furman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Grossmann et al., 2014</a>). In contrast to ABC exporters comprising two consensus sites, the NBDs of TM287/288 remain in contact mainly via the degenerate site D-loop even in the absence of nucleotides (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hohl et al., 2014</a>). A subnanometer-resolution cryo-EM structure of the heterodimeric ABC exporter TmrAB from <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> determined in the absence of nucleotides is in support of this notion (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kim et al., 2015</a>). DEER measurements on TM287/288 in detergent solution and proteoliposomes, in the absence of nucleotides and in the presence of AMP-PNP-Mg, were in agreement with the corresponding crystal structures, showing an inward-facing TMD domain and NBDs in partial contact. AMP-PNP-Mg was shown to be insufficient to fully close the NBDs and to support the transition to the OF state (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hohl et al., 2014</a>)."

DEER measurements performed with ATP in the absence of the co-factor magnesium revealed that a fraction of transporters switched to the OF state without ATP hydrolysis. Measurements performed under the same experimental conditions with BmrCD and MsbA highlight analogies and differences between the energy landscape of these ABC exporters. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that, in the absence of nucleotides, the NBDs of TM287/288 asymmetrically disengage upon heating to a physiological temperature of 80\u00b0C in a reversible fashion. In this state, the conformational dynamics of the NBDs are not communicated to the TMDs, resulting in decoupled movement of the NBDs from the rest of the protein. Due to the stabilization of cross-NBD contacts mediated by binding of a nucleotide to the degenerate ATP binding site, NBD separation at high temperature does not occur in the presence of nucleotides."

Simulations performed with a rotamer library of spin-labeled side chains available in the software MMM (<a href=\"#bib40\">Polyhach et al., 2011</a>) using the apo structure of TM287/288 and a homology model based on Sav1866 indicated that the six pairs allow monitoring of the conformational changes propagated from the NBDs to the TMDs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Four out of these six pairs were already used in a previous study (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hohl et al., 2014</a>) but investigated only under apo and AMP-PNP-Mg conditions. Here, we investigated a comprehensive set of ATP analogs and experimental conditions to trigger the conformational transitions in this ABC exporter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Nucleotides were used at a concentration of 2.5 mM together with 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (indicated as nucleotide-Mg) throughout the study. To address the effect of ATP binding alone on the conformational transition, we also used ATP (2.5 and 14 mM) in the presence of 2.5 mM EDTA to chelate the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. All spin-labeled mutants (spin labeling efficiency\u00a0&gt;70%) were shown to retain robust ATPase activity (&gt;90%) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Spin-labeled mutants as well as wildtype TM287/288 were reconstituted into proteoliposomes and stimulation of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of 50 \u00b5M, 100 \u00b5M and 150 \u00b5M Hoechst 33342 was determined (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Data were normalized to the ATPase activity of reconstituted wildtype TM287/288 in the absence of drug. All spin-labeled mutants exhibited a robust ATPase stimulation upon addition of Hoechst 33342 which was maximal at 50 \u00b5M or 100 \u00b5M Hoechst 33342 depending on the mutant investigated. As in other heterodimeric multidrug ABC exporters (<a href=\"#bib22\">H\u00fcrlimann et al., 2016</a>) the curves were bell-shaped, i.e. the ATPase activity declined between 100 \u00b5M and 150 \u00b5M Hoechst 33342. The maximal ATPase stimulation was less pronounced for the extracellular pairs and for the intracellular pair 131<sup>TM288</sup>/248<sup>TM288</sup>, indicating that spin-labeling at these positions changes the properties of TM287/288 in terms of drug binding or communication between the TMDs and the NBDs underlying stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of drugs. Despite these modest differences, all spin-labeled mutants were functional and retained the ability to sense drug binding."

In fact, the tolerance between simulated mean distances to the experimental ones in the six pairs agree within this rmsd when using the 2013 MMM\u00a0library; the 2015 library gives slightly worse results (especially for pairs 150\u2013295 and 350\u2013475) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Addition of ATP-Mg in the presence of vanadate (ATP-Vi-Mg) induced distinct distance changes in all six pairs compared to the apo state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, magenta versus cyan lines). ADP trapping by vanadate, which is expected to occur in the catalytically active consensus site, switched the great majority of the transporters to a conformation strongly resembling the homology model based on the outward-facing structure of Sav1866 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). With respect to the apo state, the NBDs and intracellular TMD pairs showed a decrease in interspin distance. Concomitantly, the two pairs in the extracellular region showed an increase of the mean distances. Intriguingly, a large width of the distance distribution was obtained in the extracellular region, encompassing the distances already present in the apo state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), possibly highlighting structural heterogeneities. The mean distances obtained in this state are within an acceptable level of agreement with those predicted by MMM on the OF homology model (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It should be noted that in this case the errors caused by the coarse-grained library approach add to the intrinsic errors produced by homology modeling in terms of side-chain arrangements, which influence the number of spin label rotamers calculated, and as a consequence thereof the distance distributions."

Since TM287/288 stems from the hyperthermophilic bacterium <i>Thermotoga maritima</i>, ATP hydrolysis at 25\u00b0C is comparatively slow (turnover rate of 11 ATP min<sup>\u22121</sup>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and thereby resembles the experimental condition of ATP hydrolysis inhibited by vanadate at 50\u00b0C (turnover rate of 22 ATP min<sup>\u22121</sup>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Inhibition of ATPase activity by vanadate was measured over a range of vanadate concentrations at 50\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Based on fitting and calculations as outlined in the material and methods, vanadate has a K<sub>i</sub> of 75.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.4 nM (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Of note, at 1 mM vanadate concentration the residual ATPase activity was 8% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This indicates that the vanadate-trapped state of TM287/288 is not very stable and a fraction of transporters run through the transport cycle."

Both sites bind nucleotides with different affinities, but ATP hydrolysis occurs mainly if not exclusively at the consensus site. In addition, the ATP binding sites are allosterically coupled (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hohl et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Grossmann et al., 2014</a>). To study the apparent affinities of the nucleotide analogs and ADP, the ATPase activity of TM287/288 was measured in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP at increasing nucleotide concentration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and D</a>). Assuming that changes of the ATPase activity are mainly caused by competition at the consensus site, the data were fitted with a single site hyperbolic function (see materials and methods) to determine an IC<sub>50</sub> of these compounds. Using the relation IC<sub>50</sub>=K<sub>i</sub>(1+[S]/K<sub>m</sub>), K<sub>i</sub> values for the respective nucleotides were determined (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). To conduct this calculation, an accurate K<sub>m</sub> for ATP hydrolysis at the respective temperature was measured (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and C</a>). When the ATPase assay was performed at 50\u00b0C, we determined K<sub>i\u00a0</sub>values\u00a0of 0.0439\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0062 \u00b5M, 0.246\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.042 \u00b5M and 10.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9 \u00b5M for ATP\u03b3S, AMP-PNP and ADP, respectively (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). When ATPase activities were determined at 25\u00b0C (i.e. the temperature at which spin-labeled TM287/288 were pre-incubated before flash-freezing), the corresponding K<sub>i</sub> values were 0.204\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.032 \u00b5M, 1.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.51 \u00b5M and 3.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.44 \u00b5M for ATP\u03b3S, AMP-PNP and ADP, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These measurements revealed that at both temperatures ATP\u03b3S is the strongest inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis. It is well established that ATP\u03b3S is slowly hydrolyzed by ATPases, as for example the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATPase (<a href=\"#bib53\">Turina and Capaldi, 1994</a>). In ABCB1 the rate of hydrolysis of ATP\u03b3S was 0.4% of that determined for ATP (<a href=\"#bib50\">Siarheyeva et al., 2010</a>). It is reasonable to assume that TM287/288 is as well capable of slow ATP\u03b3S hydrolysis. In addition, we tested whether TM287/288 hydrolyzes AMP-PNP. In contrast to ATP\u03b3S, hydrolysis of AMP-PNP releases P<sub>i</sub>, which can be detected by the molybdate/malachite green method. We found that TM287/288 is unable to cleave AMP-PNP within the sensitivity of our assay (&lt;0.01 P<sub>i</sub> min<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

To test whether the transition to the OF state also occurs in the absence of ATP hydrolysis, 2.5 mM EDTA was added to chelate any remaining Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Although our ATPase assay would have permitted a reliable detection of a residual turnover of as little as 0.01 ATP min<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), we did not observe any detectable ATPase activity under these conditions. We therefore concluded that the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> is an absolute requirement for ATPase activity of TM287/288 and that 2.5 mM EDTA is sufficient to completely chelate Mg<sup>2+</sup>. DEER measurements on samples pre-incubated with ATP-EDTA revealed that a fraction of transporters underwent the conformational transition to the OF state, while the majority stayed in an apo-like IF conformation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, green lines). Thus, in TM287/288 the transition to the OF state does not strictly require ATP hydrolysis. Instead, in agreement with the ATP switch model (<a href=\"#bib18\">Higgins and Linton, 2004</a>) solely ATP binding (even in the complete absence of magnesium) is sufficient to induce the transition. However, it should be emphasized that in contrast to vanadate trapping, the IF-OF equilibrium was only partially shifted to the OF state in the presence of ATP-EDTA. Due to a lack of ATP hydrolysis, the K<sub>m</sub> of ATP in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions could not be determined, and 2.5 mM ATP-EDTA may in fact represent a non-saturating nucleotide concentration. Therefore, DEER traces for three selected pairs were also determined in the presence of 14 mM ATP and 2.5 mM EDTA. No significant differences were observed between distance distributions obtained at 2.5 mM or 14 mM ATP under Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions, showing that the results report on IF-OF equilibria obtained at a\u00a0saturating nucleotide concentration (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

The ATPase turnover rate of the E-to-Q mutant was 0.022 ATP min<sup>\u22121</sup> at 25\u00b0C (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This residual activity is unlikely to arise from the degenerate site, because the\u00a0substitution of the non-canonical Walker B aspartate of the degenerate site with asparagine in addition to the E-to-Q mutation of the consensus site did not further decrease the ATPase activity (data not shown). The spin-labeled E-to-Q samples were incubated with ATP-Mg for 10 min at 25\u00b0C prior to freezing, therefore the ATP turnover amounted to 0.22 per transporter. In other words, at least 78% of the transporters have never undergone a hydrolysis cycle during the incubation period. The apo states in the E-to-Q mutant showed interspin distances in all six pairs, which were almost superimposable to those obtained in the wildtype transporter, indicating that the transporter was structurally unaffected by the mutation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, cyan lines to be compared with <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Addition of ATP-Mg resulted in the almost complete switch of the transporters to the OF state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, red lines). Since the great majority of transporters have not undergone a single ATP hydrolysis reaction prior to sample freezing, we can conclude that ATP hydrolysis is not necessary for the conformational switch in the E-to-Q mutant. Rather, the E-to-Q mutation stalls the ATP hydrolysis reaction in the pre-hydrolytic state. Notably, addition of ATP-EDTA to the transporter carrying the E-to-Q mutation also resulted in an almost complete switch from the IF to the OF state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, green lines). This finding is in line with a study on SUR1 carrying the E-to-Q mutation, which could be more efficiently switched to the OF state by ATP-EDTA than the wildtype protein. In SUR1, this finding was interpreted to be caused by the removal of the negatively charged glutamate from the consensus site, leading to an increased nucleotide affinity (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ortiz et al., 2013</a>). However, this explanation does not hold true for TM287/288 because DEER traces of wildtype TM287/288 remained unchanged regardless whether 2.5 mM or 14 mM ATP were added together with 2.5 mM EDTA, meaning that all our measurements were conducted at saturating nucleotide concentrations. Our data therefore suggest that the E-to-Q mutant has an altered energy profile, resulting in a higher overall propensity to adopt the OF state. In agreement with this notion, incubation with ATP\u03b3S-Mg also resulted in a larger fraction of OF states in equilibrium with an apo-like state as compared to the wildtype transporter. Again, ATP\u03b3S-Mg was added at saturating concentration (&gt;12000 fold over K<sub>i</sub> of ATP\u03b3S-Mg in wildtype TM287/288, see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), and the observed differences cannot be explained by an increased affinity of ATP\u03b3S-Mg for the E-to-Q mutant. In addition to an altered energy profile, hydrolysis of ATP\u03b3S-Mg is further slowed down in the E-to-Q mutant relative to the wildtype transporter thereby prolonging the OF state lifetime (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, black lines)."

In the intracellular region, possibly a small OF-like distance peak can be identified with AMP-PNP-Mg in the pair 231<sup>TM287</sup>/304<sup>TM287</sup>, and in the extracellular region (pair 50<sup>TM287</sup>/271<sup>TM287</sup>) an indication of a broad distance which could be related to an OF-like state was detected (see also Gaussian analysis in\u00a0<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Surprisingly, when monitoring the response of the NBDs, we found a relatively large fraction of the short distance peak\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) reporting the closure of the consensus site (pair 460<sup>TM287</sup>/363<sup>TM288</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>, purple lines). In contrast, the degenerate site (pair 350<sup>TM287</sup>/475<sup>TM288</sup>) did not show changes in the distance distribution with AMP-PNP-Mg, suggesting an asymmetric closure of the NBDs with AMP-PNP-Mg. This unexpected finding seemingly contradicts the TM287/288 structure, which features asymmetric AMP-PNP-Mg binding to the degenerate site only. However, we wish to emphasize that in the inward-facing structure of TM287/288, AMP-PNP-Mg does not reach over to the ABC signature motif of the opposite NBD. Hence, the ABC signature motif of the degenerate site, which in fact deviates from the consensus LSGGQ motif, appears to be incapable of establishing a contact to AMP-PNP-Mg required to support complete NBD closure."

This also holds true for ATP-EDTA, which did not exhibit a change in distance distribution by increasing the ATP concentration from 2.5 mM to 14 mM (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Therefore, the IF/OF fractions detected in the sample reflect the average life time that the nucleotide-bound transporter spends in either conformation. To rank the nucleotides in terms of their ability to support the transition to the OF conformation, we used three representative pairs in the wildtype transporter and the E-to-Q mutant: one in the extracellular region (50<sup>TM287</sup>/271<sup>TM287</sup>), one in the intracellular region (131<sup>TM288</sup>/248<sup>TM288</sup>) of the TMDs, and one in the NBDs (460<sup>TM287</sup>/363<sup>TM288</sup>) for which the distance peaks corresponding to the two states were distinguishable. A two-Gaussian fit of the DEER traces was performed to obtain the area of the corresponding IF and OF distance peaks (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). The rank of nucleotides with respect to increasing fractions of the OF populations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) was: ADP-Mg \u2248 AMP-PNP-Mg &lt; ATP-EDTA &lt; ATP\u03b3S-Mg &lt; ATP-Mg &lt; ATP-Vi-Mg. The order is similar for the wildtype and E-to-Q mutant transporter. However, the OF state is in general more populated in the E-to-Q mutant, which is best explained by an alteration of the energy profile caused by the mutation. This notion is best appreciated for ATP-EDTA and ATP-Mg, which could trigger an almost complete switch in the molecular ensemble of the E-to-Q mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

Raising the temperature from 25\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C changed the distance distribution from a monomodal peak centered at 2.5 nm, which is in line with the apo state crystal structure, to a broadly distributed pattern featuring distances from 2 to 8 nm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This effect was found to be fully reversible (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) and posits that the degenerate site is largely destabilized at higher temperatures in the absence of nucleotides. A less pronounced effect was observed at the consensus site (pair 460<sup>TM287</sup>/363<sup>TM288</sup>), showing some broadening of the distance distribution, which however was still featuring a prominent peak at 3.5 nm in agreement with the crystallized IF structure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The distinct effects observed in the consensus and degenerate sites point to an asymmetric opening of the two nucleotide binding sites at physiological temperature in the absence of nucleotides. DEER measurements on the other intracellular and extracellular pairs indicated that the disengagement of the NBDs resulting from incubation at high temperature is not propagated to the TMDs and does not result in a further opening of the inward-facing cavity. In other words, the NBDs are decoupled in terms of dynamics from the rest of the transporter when no nucleotides are present."

Although AMP-PNP-Mg does not directly bridge the NBD dimer, its presence at the degenerate site leads to a reorientation of several side chains that collectively result in the establishment of a larger number of hydrogen bonds across the NBD dimer, mainly mediated by the asymmetric D-loops of the degenerate and the consensus site (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

The K<sub>i</sub> of ATP\u03b3S-Mg decreases with increasing temperature (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). However, because ATP\u03b3S-Mg was added at saturating concentration, the increased affinity cannot explain the increased population of the OF state. Rather, the temperature dependence of the IF-to-OF transition rate may be steeper than the one of the OF-to-IF transition, resulting in an increased population of the OF state at high temperature. An analogous observation was made for CFTR (<a href=\"#bib5\">Csan\u00e1dy et al., 2006</a>). Notably, incubation at 80\u00b0C with AMP-PNP-Mg induced a small but detectable fraction of short distances in the distance distribution only in the consensus site (pair 460<sup>TM287</sup>/363<sup>TM288</sup>), analogous to the asymmetric NBD closure observed in the E-to-Q mutant (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

This is not the case for the NBDs, which partially disengage in an asymmetric fashion in the absence of nucleotides and thereby decouple from the TMDs in terms of dynamics. However, NBD separation in the absence of nucleotides, which we were able to force <i>in vitro</i>, is unlikely to occur in the native context of <i>T. maritima</i> cells. The cytoplasm contains high concentrations of ATP, and one ATP molecule is bound tightly to the degenerate site of TM287/288 without being hydrolyzed and thereby stabilizes the contacts between the NBDs while the transporter adopts its IF state."

                                "text": "BmrCD is a heterodimeric ABC exporter stemming from the mesophilic bacterium <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>. A recent EPR study on BmrCD suggested that this transporter undergoes the conformational transition to the OF state in the presence of ATP-Vi-Mg (i.e. in the vanadate-trapped state), as well as under ATP turnover conditions (i.e. upon addition of ATP-Mg), but not in the presence of non-hydrolyzable AMP-PNP-Mg (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mishra et al., 2014</a>). Based on these observations it was concluded that ATP hydrolysis is strictly required for the transition to the OF state, which was called the high-energy post-hydrolysis state (HES) of the transport cycle. A generalized model was put forward which proposed fundamentally different transport mechanisms for homo- and heterodimeric ABC exporters. To verify the results of the BmrCD study and further investigate this transporter with the comprehensive set of nucleotides used to study TM287/288 in terms of conformational triggers, we monitored the response of cys-less BmrCD (called wildtype for simplicity) spin labeled at the degenerate site of the NBDs (348<sup>BmrC</sup>/532<sup>BmrD</sup>). In analogy to the E-to-Q mutant of TM287/288, we also introduced the E592Q<sup>BmrD</sup> mutation in the consensus ATP binding site of 348<sup>BmrC</sup>/532<sup>BmrD</sup> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The response of wildtype BmrCD was found to be fully in accord with the published data (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mishra et al., 2014</a>). In the apo state, the distances between the two spin labels are broadly distributed, indicative of a large disorder trapped in the frozen molecular ensemble, which is not further propagated to the TMDs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, cyan line). This result is reminiscent of the response of TM287/288 incubated at high temperatures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Upon addition of AMP-PNP-Mg, ATP\u03b3S-Mg or ADP-Mg a fingerprint distance centered at 4.8 nm appeared in BmrCD, indicative of an IF conformation in which the NBDs are in contact, but not fully closed. This finding is perfectly in line with the IF conformation of TM287/288 under the same experimental conditions (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The short distance of 3 nm, which is characteristic for the OF state of BmrCD, was prominently populated upon addition of ATP-Vi-Mg, resulting in vanadate trapping at the consensus site (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, magenta line). Finally, a quick incubation with ATP-Mg induced the conformational switch to the OF state in a measurable fraction of transporters (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, red line), i.e. a condition under which the ATPase cycle is operating, which is in agreement with (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mishra et al., 2014</a>). In contrast to TM287/288, ATP\u03b3S-Mg could only populate the nucleotide-bound state centered at 4.8 nm, but did not result in the switch to the OF state. The K<sub>i</sub> for ATPase inhibition of BmrCD at 25\u00b0C was determined to be 21.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2 \u03bcM\u00a0and 26.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3 \u03bcM\u00a0for AMP-PNP-Mg and ATP\u03b3S-Mg, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Compared to TM287/288, these nucleotide analogs are much weaker inhibitors of ATPase activity. Despite the fact that nucleotides were added at saturating conditions, poor ATPase inhibition appears to correlate with their inability to close and stabilize the NBD dimer. Addition of 2.5 mM or 10 mM ATP-EDTA did not result in detectable\u00a0changes of the conformational ensemble with respect to the apo state and in contrast to AMP-PNP-Mg, ATP\u03b3S-Mg and ADP-Mg the nucleotide-bound fingerprint distance centered at 4.8 nm was not populated in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Of note, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is not only required for ATP hydrolysis, but also mediates important contacts between ATP and the Walker A serine. Its omission generally results in a drastic decrease of nucleotide affinity as shown for example for BmrA and TM287/288\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Hohl et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">Orelle et al., 2003</a>). ATPase activity measurements revealed that TM287/288 exhibits a very high apparent affinity of 3.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.42 \u00b5M for ATP-Mg at 25\u00b0C, whereas the corresponding affinity amounts only to 343\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024 \u00b5M for BmrCD (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Due to the lack of ATPase activity in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, it was not possible to determine a K<sub>m</sub> for ATP-EDTA. The K<sub>m</sub> for ATP-EDTA may be very high and even the addition of 10 mM ATP-EDTA was probably insufficient to elicit a measurable conformational change as compared to apo BmrCD. Alternatively, ATP-EDTA may have been added at a saturating concentration (as it was the case for TM287/288), but the mere presence of ATP without Mg<sup>2+</sup> may have been insufficient to mediate NBD contacts as seen in inward-facing TM287/288 or full NBD closure leading to the OF state."

Vanadate trapping results in switching to the OF state, in agreement with the crystal structures (<a href=\"#bib3\">Borbat et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zou et al., 2009</a>). Here, we show that under the same experimental conditions used for TM287/288 and BmrCD, MsbA partially switched to an OF state upon ATP-EDTA addition (as in TM287/288 but in contrast to BmrCD). Finally, in contrast to both heterodimeric ABC exporters, AMP-PNP-Mg addition supported a complete transition to the OF state in homodimeric MsbA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>), as shown previously (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mittal et al., 2012</a>). Hence, in MsbA containing two consensus ATP binding sites, very similar structural responses are induced by AMP-PNP-Mg and ATP-Vi-Mg (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>).

While recent crystal structures have elucidated the various conformations adopted by ABC exporters in great detail, the nature of the power stroke required for the switch from the IF to the OF state and thereby fueling active substrate transport is a current matter of debate. Here, we studied by EPR how the conformational dynamics of the heterodimeric multidrug transporter TM287/288 is controlled by various nucleotides and a mutation interrupting the ATP hydrolysis reaction. TM287/288 is currently the only heterodimeric ABC exporter featuring asymmetric NBDs with one hydrolysis-incompetent ATP binding site for which a high-resolution structure is available. These reliable atomic models facilitate the DEER analysis and can be directly compared with the data obtained in solution. DEER is a valuable technique, which allows monitoring of the conformational equilibria existing at physiological temperature, by cryo-trapping the molecular ensembles. Our data revealed that in TM287/288 the IF and OF states can be populated simultaneously in the presence of nucleotides. The presence of both conformations proves the existence of an IF-OF equilibrium, which can be modified by the binding of different nucleotides and ATP hydrolysis. Solely ATP binding without hydrolysis \u2013 as shown by adding ATP-EDTA to the samples \u2013 is sufficient to switch a fraction of transporters from the IF to the OF state. Therefore, our findings call a recent study on BmrCD into question, which claimed that ATP hydrolysis is an absolute requirement for triggering the IF to OF transition in heterodimeric ABC exporters encompassing a degenerate ATP binding site (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mishra et al., 2014</a>). Rather, our study highlights the role of a dynamic interplay between coexisting IF and OF states in ABC exporters, which are interconverted in a transporter-specific manner by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. While the different energy minima populated according to the DEER analyses agree with crystal structures representing IF and OF states, their interconversion is specific to the ABC exporter investigated. For example, MsbA switched completely to the OF state in the presence of AMP-PNP-Mg (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a> and [<a href=\"#bib34\">Mittal et al., 2012</a>]), TM287/288 and BmrCD were instead stabilized in an IF state in which the NBDs were in close contact (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Interestingly, AMP-PNP was also shown to prevent the switching to the OF state in SUR1, the regulatory subunit of the neuroendocrine ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ortiz et al., 2013</a>) and it is known to be a poor nucleotide analog to switch CFTR to its chloride conducting OF state (<a href=\"#bib54\">Vergani et al., 2003</a>). Another example is the different response among ABC exporters with regard to ATP-EDTA: LmrA completely switched to the OF state (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hellmich et al., 2012</a>), BmrCD did not (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>) and MsbA and TM287/288 did to some extent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

It is undisputed that ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs drive active transport by ABC exporters and \u2013 with a few exceptions \u2013 the field agrees that a typical ABC exporter adopts two principal states, namely an IF state with NBDs fully or partially separated and an OF state with nucleotides bound at the closed NBD dimer interface. The debated key questions, however, deal with the molecular events leading from an open to a closed NBD dimer having two nucleotides sandwiched at the interface, thereby acting as molecular glue, and with the coupling of these movements to the TMDs."

In this study, we confirm this notion for MsbA and BmrCD and show that in TM287/288 at physiologically high temperatures, the IF conformation features separated NBDs, which are decoupled from the rest of the transporter, as in BmrCD. This decoupling unraveled a level of dynamic freedom between the engine and the TMDs which was not expected based on the coupling through the two main and two accessory coupling helices observed in crystallized states. Of note, in the living cell, ATP levels are (in average) in the millimolar range (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yaginuma et al., 2014</a>), so that the apo state is a very rare event, namely when nucleotides are exchanged at the same time at both ATP binding sites. This is particularly true in the case of heterodimeric ABC exporters, which firmly hold an ATP in the high affinity degenerate site without hydrolyzing it. Therefore, we consider the apo state with the engine decoupled from the rest of the machine as an \u2018off-state\u2019 (state 0 in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>), which is rare and not required in the transport cycle. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the ATP levels greatly differ at the single cell level with some cells being devoid of detectable ATP concentrations (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yaginuma et al., 2014</a>). In such ATP-deprived cells, the functional relevance of the decoupling between NBDs and TMDs remains to be elucidated."

In the crystal structure of TM287/288 AMP-PNP was shown to bind exclusively to the degenerate site. In contrast to ABC exporters with two consensus sites crystallized in IF states, which exhibit fully separated NBDs, the NBDs of inward-facing TM287/288 are in molecular contact (state 1a in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Importantly, AMP-PNP does not directly mediate cross-NBD contacts as those found in closed NBDs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Instead, a comparison of the apo and the AMP-PNP-Mg bound structures of TM287/288 revealed that nucleotide binding at the degenerate site results in the formation of six additional hydrogen bonds and two novel salt bridges between the NBDs via long-range conformational changes mainly involving the two asymmetric D-loops (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). The functional importance of nucleotide binding to the degenerate site resulting in a NBD-NBD contact in the inward-facing transporter can be appreciated in both heterodimeric ABC exporters studied so far. In the case of BmrCD in the absence of nucleotides, the NBDs are fully separated, akin to structures of inward-facing ABCB1 or MsbA. However, in the presence of the nucleotides AMP-PNP-Mg, ATP\u03b3S-Mg and ADP-Mg, the NBDs get closer, with a fingerprint distance, which agrees with NBD-NBD contact as seen in the TM287/288 IF structures. In case of TM287/288, heating to 80\u00b0C in the absence of nucleotides was required to obtain an IF state with asymmetrically separated NBDs. Again, the presence of AMP-PNP-Mg, ATP\u03b3S-Mg and ADP-Mg prevented NBD separation at 80\u00b0C, maintaining the transporter in an IF state resembling the crystal structures. Hence, as rationalized by the comparison of AMP-PNP-Mg bound and apo TM287/288 structures, nucleotide binding to the degenerate site (and possibly also to the consensus site as shown in state 1b), even including the hydrolysis product ADP, prevents NBD separation under physiological conditions in TM287/288 and BmrCD (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). This distinctive structural feature differentiates the heterodimeric ABC exporters BmrCD and TM287/288 from the homodimeric ABC exporters studied by DEER, namely MsbA and LmrA, which were shown to cycle only between two states characterized by fully separated and fully closed NBDs."

                        "text": "Importantly, the partial NBD contacts of inward-facing TM287/288 are not mediated directly by nucleotide sandwiching, but rather via the D-loops (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). These contacts facilitate NBD closure, because the NBDs remain appropriately aligned. By contrast, fully separated NBDs of homodimeric ABC exporters have to sample a much larger conformational space for their correct dimerization. Nucleotides only act as molecular glue, thus creating the closed NBD sandwiched dimer, at the end of the IF to OF state trajectory by bridging the Walker A motif of the first with the ABC signature motif of the second NBD and <i>vice versa</i> (state 2 in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). In other words, nucleotide binding to fully or partially separated NBDs of inward-facing ABC exporters is unlikely a requirement for NBD closure. Instead, the transition between opened and closed NBDs \u2013 and consequently \u2013 the transition between the IF and OF state likely occurs spontaneously by Brownian motion even in the absence of nucleotides. This was demonstrated previously by cross-linking experiments on TM287/288 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hohl et al., 2012</a>), cryo-EM studies on MsbA (<a href=\"#bib35\">Moeller et al., 2015</a>) and for CFTR, which opens its pore spontaneously at low frequency even in the absence of nucleotides (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mih\u00e1lyi et al., 2016</a>). To stabilize the closed NBD dimer by two sandwiched nucleotides resulting in an OF orientation of the TMDs (state 2 in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>), a second nucleotide has to bind to the consensus site (state 1b) during the process of NBD closure. Our model envisages that the\u00a0interconversion between states 1b and 2 is reversible as long as the consensus site nucleotide is not committed to hydrolysis. This was demonstrated by adding ATP-EDTA at saturating concentration, which resulted in the population of a measurable fraction of OF state as a result of mere nucleotide binding. However, this was not the case for BmrCD, where a very low ATP-EDTA affinity or a strict requirement of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions likely prevented the formation of a detectable population of the OF state. Importantly, hydrolysis can only occur after NBD closure, hence the IF to OF transition must be driven by nucleotide binding rather than hydrolysis. Once the ATP at the consensus site commits to the hydrolysis reaction, the transporter irreversibly progresses first to a pre-hydrolytic and then to a post-hydrolytic state (states 3 and 4 in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>), which are structurally indistinguishable from state 2 by DEER with the available spin-labeled pairs. The molecular event of entering the hydrolysis reaction \u2013 also called nucleotide occlusion in earlier studies on ABCB1 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sauna and Ambudkar, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sauna et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2007</a>) \u2013 strongly increases nucleotide affinity (highlighted by a red colored ATP in state 3, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>) and thereby stabilizes the closed NBD sandwich dimer. The coupling between NBDs and TMDs ensures an efficient propagation of the structural rearrangements, which leads to a prolonged OF configuration of the transporter and permits substrate release (states 3 and 4 in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). In the active transporter, ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and P<sub>i</sub>, which reverts the transporter back to its IF state with a nucleotide still bound to the degenerate binding site (irreversible transition from state 4 to state 1 in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Progression of the hydrolysis reaction is slowed down by stabilization of the pre- or the post-hydrolytic state. In our study, we stabilized the pre-hydrolytic state by mutating the catalytically important Walker B glutamate of the consensus site into a glutamine (E-to-Q mutation). Further, we stabilized the post-hydrolytic state by vanadate trapping. In both regimes, a bound ATP commits to the hydrolysis reaction at the consensus site, but the hydrolysis rate is drastically slowed down, so that the transporters are trapped in the OF state (states 3 and 4 in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). In essence, entering the hydrolysis reaction appears to play an essential role in stabilizing the closed NBD dimer without being an absolute requirement to support the IF to OF switch in heterodimeric or homodimeric ABC exporters."

An analogous observation was reported for SUR1, which was attributed to an increased affinity of ATP-EDTA for the transporter as a consequence of the removal of the negatively charged catalytic glutamate (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ortiz et al., 2013</a>). However, the IF-OF ratio observed in TM287/288\u00a0incubated with 2.5 and 14 mM ATP concentrations in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions was found to be almost indistinguishable. This indicates that 2.5 mM ATP already represented a saturating concentration for the wildtype, and consequently, for the E-to-Q mutant as well.

Interestingly, AMP-PNP-Mg turned out to be unable to close the degenerate site.

This indicates that the extracellular gate of TM287/288 is a highly dynamic region of the transporter. Based on our data we cannot rule out that the extracellular gate possibly covers a conformational ensemble between outward-occluded and outward-facing states.

In BmrCD, the two IF states (with partial NBD contact or fully separated NBDs) are clearly preferred over the OF state, while from a thermodynamic point of view the two major IF and OF states populated in the presence of nucleotides are closer together in TM287/288. This explains the differences seen between the two heterodimeric ABC exporters; while the conformational switch of BmrCD could only be achieved by ATP-Mg entering a hydrolysis reaction (pre-hydrolytic by E-to-Q mutation or post-hydrolytic by vanadate trapping), nucleotide binding without ATP hydrolysis was sufficient for the switch in TM287/288. Our results therefore do not support the notion that heterodimeric ABC exporters strictly require ATP hydrolysis to switch to the OF state."

Consequently, this pre-orientation facilitates NBD closure and may be relevant for substrate binding and regulatory mechanisms in these ABC exporters."

                                "text": "Energy landscapes likely have profound effects on the function of each ABC exporter. The energy profile governs the dwelling time of the transporter in the various states of the transport cycle, thereby kinetically tailoring the interaction with substrates and regulatory partners on either side of the membrane and the ATP hydrolysis reaction at the NBDs. An altered energy profile may be the underlying mechanism behind many unexpected phenotypes of transporter point mutants. A noteworthy example to be studied in this respect is a mutation in the NBDs of the multidrug transporter Pdr5, which changed the drug transport profile of this transporter (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ernst et al., 2008</a>). Future studies of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of ABC transporters will likely reveal unprecedented clues about their function and molecular mechanism."

Two following rotamer libraries were used: the MTSL library at 175 K available in the MMM2013 version, and the new library at ambient temperature from the MMM2015 version. The following criteria were used: strategic position in the whole transporter, high accessibility towards the aqueous environment, high number of populated rotamers and distinct distances in the inward with respect to the outward-facing models. For the in-silico analysis, the inward-facing crystal structure of TM287/288 in its apo state (PDB: 4Q4H) and the outward-facing structure created by homology modeling using Sav1866 (PDB: 2HYD) were used as templates."

                                "text": "Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) measurements were performed at 50 K on a Bruker ELEXSYS E580Q-AWG (arbitrary wave generator) dedicated pulse Q-band spectrometer equipped with a 150 W TWT amplifier. A 4-pulse DEER sequence with rectangular, non-selective observer and pump pulses of 14 or 16 ns length (depending on the available B<sub>1</sub> at the sample) with 100 MHz frequency separation was used (<a href=\"#bib41\">Polyhach et al., 2012</a>). Due to the coherent nature of the AWG generated pulses, a four-step phase cycling (0 \u2013 \u03c0/2 - \u03c0 \u2013 3/2\u03c0) of the pump \u03c0 pulse was performed to remove unwanted effects of running echoes from the DEER trace. The evaluation of the DEER data was performed using DeerAnalysis2015 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jeschke et al., 2006</a>). The background of the primary DEER traces was corrected using stretched exponential functions with homogeneous dimensions of 1.5 to 3 for different samples. A model-free Tikhonov regularization was used to extract distance distributions from the background corrected form factors. The data of the apo and AMP-PNP-Mg states of the four pairs 150<sup>TM287</sup>/295<sup>TM288</sup>, 131<sup>TM288</sup>/248<sup>TM288</sup>, 460<sup>TM287</sup>/363<sup>TM288</sup>, 350<sup>TM287</sup>/475<sup>TM288</sup> in the wildtype transporter are taken from (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hohl et al., 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "To extract the fraction of OF and IF states in the distribution, a model-based two-Gaussian fitting was also used, which generally resulted in a lower quality of the fit of the form factors. The fit was first performed on the ATP-Vi-Mg state, and the obtained mean distance and width (\u03c3) of the major OF distribution were found, and kept fixed for the fit of all other states. The parameters of the second Gaussian were allowed to vary to take into account small variation in the distributions in different states. More than two protein batches were used for all mutants investigated and the DEER data at room and high temperature were found to be highly reproducible."

A high-resolution crystal structure solved previously by the authors was used to define suitable pairs that track distance changes between opposing nucleotide binding domain (NBD) surfaces both in the canonical and the degenerate nucleotide binding site, and between the intracellular or extracellular ends of pairs of transmembrane \u03b1 helices. These measurements enable the authors to quantify the steady-state (under hydrolytic conditions) or equilibrium (under non-hydrolytic conditions) distribution of the transporter between inward-facing (IF) and outward-facing (OF) transmembrane domain conformations, and between open (disengaged) and closed (dimerized) conformations of either of the two interfacial nucleotide binding sites. Using this powerful approach the authors demonstrate that (i) the IF conformation is coupled with an open canonical and a partially open degenerate nucleotide binding site, while the OF conformation is coupled with dimerized NBDs, (ii) different nucleotides are differentially efficient in shifting the IF&lt;-&gt;OF conformational distribution, (iii) nucleotide hydrolysis is not required for the IF-&gt;OF step, (iv) the distribution can be shifted towards the OF conformation by trapping the transporter in a prehydrolytic (E-to-Q mutation of the catalytic base) or posthydrolytic (using ATP+vanadate) state (v) or by raising temperature, and (vi) that distinct differences in conformational energetics can be detected for different asymmetric and symmetric ABC exporters."

However, this interpretation is incorrect, since \u2013 except for the apo condition \u2013 the DEER measurements were all performed at saturating nucleotide concentrations (2.5 mM, whereas K<sub>i</sub>values are low \u03bcM for each; see comment 4., above). Instead, the fraction of transporter proteins found in the OF state at any moment (P(OF)) reflects the fraction of time each transporter spends in OF at steady state (in saturating MgATP) or at equilibrium (in apo condition, in saturating MgATgS, MgAMP-PNP, MgADP, or ATP/EDTA, or with E-to-Q mutation). Thus, P(OF)=t(OF)/(t(IF)+t(OF)), where t(IF) and t(OF) are the average life times of the IF and OF conformations, respectively. E.g., the larger P(OF) in MgATP+Vi than in MgATP observed for WT Tm287/288, or of the E-to-Q mutant compared to WT (both in MgATP), likely reflect longer t(OF) values due to trapping in post- and prehydrolytic OF states, respectively. Similarly, the smaller P(OF) values of WT in MgAMP-PNP, ATP/EDTA, or ATPgS compared to those of the E-to-Q mutant in MgATP likely reflect both shorter t(OF) (due to a less stable NBD dimer) and longer t(IF) (due to less efficient NBD dimerization). Thus, the efficiencies of the nucleotides to stabilize the OF conformation correlates with their structural similarities to ATP, which is the strongest \"glue\" for holding the NBDs together (but is hydrolyzed in WT). Such an interpretation would be consistent with observations on other ABC proteins. E.g., NBD dimerization is facilitated by an intra-NBD subdomain closure in which the \u03b1-helical tail subdomain approaches the \u03b2-sheet head subdomain; this \"induced fit\" is elicited by binding of ATP, but not ADP (Karpowich et al., 2001, Structure 9:571-586). Consequently, isolated E-to-Q mutant NBDs form stable dimers in MgATP, but less so in AMP-PNP, ATPgS, or ATP without Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and not at all in ADP (Moody et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:21111-14; Veron et al., 2003, J Mol Biol 334:255-267). Similar conclusions have been reached on CFTR, for which the rates for the IF-&gt;OF transition (pore opening) and OF-&gt;IF transition (pore closure) can be directly measured, and have been observed in the presence of all of these nucleotides (e.g., Vergani et al., 2003, J Gen Physiol 121:17-36)."

However, this interpretation cannot be correct, as all nucleotides were applied at saturating concentrations at both temperatures (see comment 4, above). A more likely explanation is a steeper temperature dependence (larger deltaH<sup>+</sup>+) of the IF-&gt;OF transition compared to the OF-&gt;IF transition, under both hydrolytic and non-hydrolytic conditions. Indeed, this would be consistent with temperature-dependence of CFTR gating transitions (Mathews et al., 1998, J Membrane Biol 163:55-66; Csanady et al., 2006, J Gen Physiol 128:523-533), for which deltaH<sup>+</sup>+ for pore opening (IF-&gt;OF transition) is ~117 kJ/mol (Q10=~4.6), while deltaH<sup>+</sup>+ for pore closure (OF-&gt;IF transition) is ~69 kJ/mol (Q10=~2.5) under hydrolytic, and ~40 kJ/mol (Q10=~1.7) under non-hydrolytic conditions, causing strong temperature dependence of open probability (i.e., P(OF))."

In other words, the NBDs are decoupled from the rest of the transporter when no nucleotides are present\". Strictly speaking this statement seems to apply only to the degenerate site.

The simulation program MMM is based on spin label rotamer libraries, which are obtained by MD simulations at different temperatures. Different libraries (e.g. 2015 library at ambient temperature, or 2013 library at cryogenic temperature) give different shapes of the distance distributions, due to the different weight of each rotamer in the calculation. The comparison between two libraries is presented in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1 \u2014figure supplement 1</a>. A 3.5-4 \u00c5 rmsd between experimental and calculated mean distances was found with the 2013 rotamer library (Jeschke, G. (2013). Conformational dynamics and distribution of nitroxide spin labels. Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 72, 42-60). In the apo state, the simulated mean distances in the six pairs agree within this rmsd to the experimental ones, therefore we stated that our data are in agreement with the X-ray structure. The new library (2015) gives somehow slightly worse results (especially for pairs 150-295 and 350- 475), highlighting the coarse-grained approach used to simulate the distance distribution. We chose to show both libraries to highlight differences between them, an interesting information for the EPR community. For the homology model, the errors due to the coarse-grained library approach add to the intrinsic errors that such models can produce in terms of side chain arrangements. The latter is influencing the number and type of spin- labeled rotamers calculated, therefore the resulting distance distributions. Despite these issues, we observed a remarkable agreement between experimental and simulated distance changes. The 2013 library performs again better, with exception of the pair 460-363. We clarified this in the text. The range of distances in shaded pink and blue are indicative of the experimentally measured distributions in the vanadate-trapped and apo state, respectively and are depicted in the panels to guide the eye.

However, this interpretation is incorrect, since \u2013 except for the apo condition \u2013 the DEER measurements were all performed at saturating nucleotide concentrations (2.5 mM, whereas K<sub>i</sub> values are low \u03bcM for each; see comment 4., above). Instead, the fraction of transporter proteins found in the OF state at any moment (P(OF)) reflects the fraction of time each transporter spends in OF at steady state (in saturating MgATP) or at equilibrium (in apo condition, in saturating MgATgS, MgAMP-PNP, MgADP, or ATP/EDTA, or with E-to-Q mutation). Thus, P(OF)=t(OF)/(t(IF)+t(OF)), where t(IF) and t(OF) are the average life times of the IF and OF conformations, respectively. E.g., the larger P(OF) in MgATP+Vi than in MgATP observed for WT Tm287/288, or of the E-to-Q mutant compared to WT (both in MgATP), likely reflect longer t(OF) values due to trapping in post- and prehydrolytic OF states, respectively. Similarly, the smaller P(OF) values of WT in MgAMP-PNP, ATP/EDTA, or ATPgS compared to those of the E-to-Q mutant in MgATP likely reflect both shorter t(OF) (due to a less stable NBD dimer) and longer t(IF) (due to less efficient NBD dimerization). Thus, the efficiencies of the nucleotides to stabilize the OF conformation correlates with their structural similarities to ATP, which is the strongest \"glue\" for holding the NBDs together (but is hydrolyzed in WT). Such an interpretation would be consistent with observations on other ABC proteins. E.g., NBD dimerization is facilitated by an intra-NBD subdomain closure in which the \u03b1-helical tail subdomain approaches the \u03b2-sheet head subdomain; this \"induced fit\" is elicited by binding of ATP, but not ADP (Karpowich et al., 2001, Structure 9:571-586). Consequently, isolated E-to-Q mutant NBDs form stable dimers in MgATP, but less so in AMP-PNP, ATPgS, or ATP without Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and not at all in ADP (Moody et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:21111-14; Veron et al., 2003, J Mol Biol 334:255-267). Similar conclusions have been reached on CFTR, for which the rates for the IF-&gt;OF transition (pore opening) and OF-&gt;IF transition (pore closure) can be directly measured, and have been observed in the presence of all of these nucleotides (e.g., Vergani et al., 2003, J Gen Physiol 121:17-36).</i>"

We found an intriguing correlation between lower K<sub>i</sub> values and higher OF fractions in our data. However, due to the saturating conditions we cannot argue (as we did in the initial version of the manuscript) with different nucleotide affinities being responsible for the differences regarding the population of the OF state.

Both conditions showed fractions of IF and OF states. We therefore concluded that the ATP-EDTA measurements for TM287/288 were conducted under saturating conditions. We also used 10 mM ATP concentration for BmrCD in the presence of EDTA or Mg and found that the distance distributions were indistinguishable to those obtained with 2.5 mM nucleotide. Due to the absence of an IF fraction in the presence of EDTA, we cannot conclude that we were at saturating conditions at 10 mM ATP-EDTA. However, the absence of even a small fraction corresponding to the OF distance points to either a distinct energy landscape for BmrCD with respect to TM287/288 or to an extremely weak affinity of ATP in the absence of Magnesium ions (&gt; 100 mM)."

The measurements therefore do provide direct insight into their affinities for the asymmetric nucleotide binding sites.

For a nucleotide analog it is for example sufficient to compete for ATP binding at the consensus site to cause inhibition without binding to the degenerate site. When the same nucleotide analog is then added alone to the transporter, it may act as a \u201clousy glue\u201d to bridge Walker A with the opposite signature motif (this can happen at the degenerate or the consensus site)."

Of note, hydrolyzable nucleotides (ATP and ATP\u03b3S) act as strong \u201cglues\u201d whereas non-hydrolyzable ones (ADP and AMP-PNP) don\u2019t. That\u2019s why we propose in this study (also based on previous literature by other authors) that when a nucleotide is committed to hydrolysis, NBD dimer stability is strongly increased (see also comments below on the mechanism). Hence, we prefer to explain the low fraction of OF state in the presence of saturating concentrations of AMP-PNP-Mg or ADP-Mg with less efficient stabilization of the NBD dimer by these nucleotides. The reviewers bring up the alternative explanation of less efficient NBD dimerization and provide literature suggestions on the dimerization of isolated NBDs and the channel opening of CFTR on this topic. NBD closure and NBD stabilization are difficult to discern experimentally, because there are (at least to our knowledge) no kinetic data as for example measured by surface plasmon resonance which directly looked at NBD association and dissociation to determine k<sub>on</sub> (i.e. rate of NBD closure) and k<sub>off</sub> (rate of NBD dissociation providing insights into the stability of the NBD dimer). Current knowledge on this topic is based on crystal structures and size exclusion chromatography analyses, which provide some information about the affinity constants of closed NBDs, but no information about the rates of association and dissociation. The studies on CFTR are very interesting in this context, in which the rate of channel opening is used as readout to look at NBD closure. However, conformational changes at the NBDs are not transmitted immediately to the channel portion at the TMDs, so that the readout of channel opening only indirectly reports on the NBD closure."

Our data suggest (as many other data of the ABC transporter field) that when a nucleotide is committed to hydrolysis, this increases the affinity of the nucleotide and in turn strongly stabilizes the NBD dimer. As our experiments show, strong stabilization can be achieved in the E-to-Q mutant and ATP- Mg, without hydrolysis of the nucleotide or using vanadate trapping of ATP. On the other hand, ATP-EDTA (which is not committed to ATP hydrolysis), as well as non-hydrolyzable AMP-PNP, are much less capable of NBD-stabilization. We think that the NBDs first close (mainly driven by Brownian motion) and that during closure, two nucleotides bind. These nucleotides stabilize the closed NBD dimer at the end of the trajectory, acting as molecular glue. In case of ATP-EDTA, the glue appears weak and the OF state is poorly populated. In case of AMP-PNP, the glue is even too weak to populate any detectable OF state, at least in wildtype TM287/288. This is the state 2 we speak about in our model; it is a state in which the NBDs sandwich two nucleotides in a reversible fashion. After this initial closure of the NBDs, the nucleotide at the consensus site is either committed to hydrolysis (ATP or ATP-g-S), or not (AMP-PNP, ADP or ATP-EDTA). Only hydrolysable nucleotides lead to high fractions of OF state. In case of BmrCD, only ATP-Mg leads to any detectable OF state.
