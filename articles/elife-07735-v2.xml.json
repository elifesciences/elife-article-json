We find that DNA damage also generates nuclear actin filaments\u2014detectable by phalloidin and live-cell actin probes\u2014with three characteristic morphologies: (i) long, nucleoplasmic filaments; (ii) short, nucleolus-associated filaments; and (iii) dense, nucleoplasmic clusters. This DNA damage-induced nuclear actin assembly requires two biologically and physically linked nucleation factors: Formin-2 and Spire-1/Spire-2. Formin-2 accumulates in the nucleus after DNA damage, and depletion of either Formin-2 or actin's nuclear import factor, importin-9, increases the number of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), linking nuclear actin filaments to efficient DSB clearance. Nuclear actin filaments are also required for nuclear oxidation induced by acute genotoxic stress. Our results reveal a previously unknown role for nuclear actin filaments in DNA repair and identify the molecular mechanisms creating these nuclear filaments."

Filaments of a protein called actin are normally found outside the nucleus, where they help give the cell its overall shape and organize its contents. However, these filaments can sometimes form inside the nucleus in response to a sudden increase in heat or another type of stress. However, it was not clear what role these actin filaments play in the nucleus because it was difficult to distinguish them from the actin filaments that form in other parts of the cell."

The experiments show that the level of Formin-2 increases in the nucleus after DNA damage, and that the DNA of cells lacking this protein is more severely damaged.

Subsequent work revealed how actin filaments help organize the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells, supporting many fundamental biological processes, including: motility, division, phagocytosis, endocytosis, and membrane trafficking. The first reports of actin inside the nucleus of a cell appeared forty years ago (<a href=\"#bib28\">LeStourgeon et al., 1975</a>), and since that time, actin has been found in the nuclei of many different cell types, linked to a variety of nuclear processes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pederson and Aebi, 2002</a>)."

Actin filaments associated with germinal vesicles of starfish oocytes facilitate nuclear envelope breakdown and form a contractile net that facilitates chromosome capture during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib27\">L\u00e9n\u00e1rt et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mori et al., 2014</a>).

Monomers of actin and several actin-related proteins (Arps), for example, are conserved components of chromatin-remodeling complexes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Farrants, 2008</a>), and nuclear actin monomers inhibit the activity of the serum-responsive transcriptional co-activator MRTF (myotonin-related transcription factor) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vartiainen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mouilleron et al., 2008</a>).

Serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baarlink et al., 2013</a>) and integrin engagement in spreading cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Plessner et al., 2015</a>) induce transient (&lt;60 s) bursts of nuclear actin polymerization, driven by the nucleation activity of formin-family proteins mDia1 and mDia2. These short-lived filaments appear to promote activity of the transcriptional co-activator MRTF by depleting monomeric actin from the nucleus. Serum stimulation also activates the actin-severing protein MICAL-2, which reversibly oxidizes actin monomers, rendering them incapable of inhibiting MRTF-dependent transcription (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lundquist et al., 2014</a>). Environmental stresses also promote actin assembly in somatic cell nuclei. Heat shock, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), depletion of ATP, and oxidative stress all induce formation of nuclear filament bundles that contain large amounts of cofilin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fukui, 1978</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">Fukui and Katsumaru, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Iida et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pendleton et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2009</a>). In addition to its function as a co-factor for nuclear import, cofilin appears to play a structural role in these cofilin\u2013actin rods, which are highly oxidized and appear to be held together by intermolecular disulfide bonds between cofilin molecules (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pfannstiel et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bernstein et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>).

These filaments promote efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and are required for a DNA damage-associated burst of oxidation in the nucleus. DNA damage-induced nuclear actin structures differ in both composition and mechanism of assembly from those triggered by serum stimulation or by non-specific cell stresses. Specifically, we find that the actin regulators Formin-2 (FMN2) and Spire-1/2 nucleate nuclear actin assembly in response to DNA damage. Homologs of Formin-2 and Spire-1/2 interact directly (<a href=\"#bib61\">Quinlan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Vizcarra et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Montaville et al., 2014</a>) and collaborate to form functional actin networks in mouse and <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes.

In mammalian tissue culture cells, the distribution of Utr230-EN exhibits one of three basic patterns: (i) accumulation on cytoplasmic stress fibers and diffuse localization throughout the nucleoplasm (\u223c53% of cells); (ii) cytoplasmic stress fibers and punctate structures in the nucleoplasm (\u223c40% of cells); and (iii) primarily cytoplasmic localization to stress fibers and/or aggregates at the nuclear periphery (\u223c7% of cells) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

These various treatments all triggered assembly of actin filaments in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We compared nuclear actin filaments generated by telomere uncapping with those induced by genotoxic agents by counting the fraction of cells that contain nuclear filaments longer than 1 \u00b5m as well as the mean length of these long nuclear filaments in cells treated with either MT-hTer-47A for 5\u20137 days or 0.01% MMS for 2 hr. The fraction of cells with long filaments; the mean filament length; and the standard deviation of filament length were similar after the two treatments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013G</a>).

High concentrations of fluorescent phalloidin bound to actin filaments in the cytoplasm swamp the much smaller signal from the nucleus.

Wide-field deconvolution microscopy provided much more signal and enabled us to more easily observe the faint signal from phalloidin-bound filaments in the nucleus."

Using these probes, however, we detected filaments in a smaller fraction of 0.01% MMS-treated cells than in our Utr230-EN cell line. This is likely due to the fact that the higher fluorescence baseline of Lifeact-EN and F-tractin-EN in the nucleus obscures filaments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), and this is consistent with a parallel study in which we observed much higher levels of diffuse fluorescence from Lifeact- and F-tractin-based probes in the cytoplasm compared to Utr230 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belin et al., 2015</a>). To test this interpretation, we calculated the percentage of cells with phalloidin-stainable nuclear filaments in untransfected cells and cell lines expressing Utr230-, Lifeact-, or F-tractin-EN. In all cases, \u223c5% of untreated cells contain phalloidin-stainable nuclear actin, whereas after induction of DNA damage by 0.01% or 0.05% MMS incubation, the percent of cells with phalloidin-stainable nuclear actin increases to \u223c15% and \u223c20%, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

In the Lifeact-EN cell line, high filament density in the nucleus correlates with higher Lifeact-EN expression levels, suggesting that Lifeact stabilizes filaments or enhances polymerization rate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). The number of filaments per nucleus, however, does not correlate with Utr230-EN expression level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), suggesting that this probe does not promote filament formation in the same way as Lifeact.

Initially, we quantified DSBs by expressing a fluorescently tagged fragment of 53BP1, a commonly used live-cell marker for DSBs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dimitrova et al., 2008</a>). In our hands, however, the number of fluorescent foci generated by this 53BP1 reporter correlates directly with the expression level of the construct, making it unsuitable for quantitative studies (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Instead, we quantified DSBs by immunofluorescence, using antibodies against either 53BP1 or histone variant pS139 H2AX. This method yielded consistent DSB counts across multiple replicate samples treated with the same dose of MMS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

For these experiments, we employed siRNAs previously validated in human cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bohnsack et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dopie et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Belin et al., 2013</a>). Knocking down expression of XPO6 increased the fraction of cells with detectable nuclear actin structures as well as the average number of nuclear structures in each cell. This increase occurred in both untreated cells and cells treated with MMS. Conversely, cells from which IPO9 had been depleted lacked detectable nuclear actin structures, regardless of whether they were treated with MMS (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Loss of XPO6 had no effect on the number of DSB foci generated by MMS treatment. Loss of IPO9, however, significantly increased the number of DSBs per cell, judged using antibodies against 53BP1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) or pH2AX (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

In these experiments, we expressed either: an mCherry-3\u00d7NLS control construct; wild-type actin fused to mCherry-3\u00d7NLS; or a non-polymerizing R62D actin mutant fused to mCherry-3\u00d7NLS. Overexpressing wild-type actin-mCherry-NLS\u2014but not the R62D mutant actin construct\u2014decreased the number of DSB foci but did not completely rescue the loss of IPO9 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We figured that the partial rescue could be due to the fact that fluorescent actin fusions cannot be incorporated into some actin filaments, particularly those generated by formin-family nucleation factors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). We, therefore, modified our rescue constructs by inserting a 2A-peptide site to produce bicistronic expression of both a 3\u00d7NLS-tagged actin and an mCherry expression reporter (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Huss and Lansford, 2014</a>). Overexpression of this non-fluorescent, wild-type actin-NLS, but not the R62D mutant, resulted in a complete rescue of DSB foci counts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These results indicate that nuclear actin polymerization is required for efficient DSB clearance and suggested that nuclear actin filaments may be generated by a formin-family actin nucleator."

Surprisingly, we found no correlation between the numbers of nuclear actin filaments and DSBs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) and we observed only limited overlap between the 53BP1 and nuclear actin signals for all classes of DNA damage-induced filaments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). More detailed analysis of our co-localization data revealed that, out of 198 filaments found in nuclei of cells treated with 0.01% MMS for 2 hr, only 22 (11.1%) overlap or lie adjacent to 53BP1 foci. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that some fraction of the observed overlap represents a functional interaction. One way to address this possibility would be to simultaneously track DSBs and nuclear actin filaments in live cells, but this would require a more reliable live-cell DSB marker. Given that expression of our fluorescent protein-tagged 53BP1 derivative is correlated with higher foci counts (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), which may include numerous spuriously detected loci, we found this tool to be unsuitable for quantitative live-cell imaging."

One such protein is the actin nucleator Formin-2 (FMN2). In addition to its phosphorylation, the expression of FMN2 is upregulated in response to both ultraviolet radiation and hypoxia (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yamada et al., 2013a</a>). To test whether FMN2 is involved in nuclear actin assembly, we used shRNAs to deplete it from cells expressing the Utr230-EN nuclear actin probe (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When we induce DNA damage with 0.01% MMS, depletion of FMN2 completely inhibits nuclear actin assembly.

Ectopic expression of this mCherry-FMN2 mutant completely restored the number and morphology of the actin structures generated by MMS treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). As with IPO9 knockdown, we found that FMN2 knockdown produces a significant increase in DSB foci observed following MMS treatment. The increase in 53BP1 foci was also rescued by overexpression of hairpin-resistant mCherry-FMN2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Since FMN2 homologs from other vertebrate organisms interact with Spire-family actin nucleators, we knocked down human Spire family members Spire-1 and Spire2 and determined their effect on DNA damage-induced filament assembly (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Knocking down Spire-1 or Spire-2 individually has little effect on DNA damage-induced filament formation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but knocking down expression of both proteins at the same time produces the same effect as knocking down FMN2, ablating MMS-induced nuclear filament formation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

To determine whether DNA damage also induces nuclear translocation, we imaged subcellular distribution of mCherry-FMN2 before and after incubation with 0.01% and 0.05% MMS. We observed that this DNA-damaging agent produces a dose-dependent nuclear accumulation of FMN2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with a direct role for FMN2 in the assembly of actin filaments in the nucleus following DNA damage. To better understand the nuclear accumulation of FMN2, we searched for a potential nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in human FMN2 using the online bioinformatics tool, cNLS-Mapper (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kosugi et al., 2009</a>). We identified two putative NLS regions near the N-terminus of FMN2, beginning at amino acids 6 and 411 of the NCBI reference sequence, accession number NP_064450.3 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). To determine whether these regions are functional NLSs, we fused each to an EGFP reporter and expressed it in HeLa cells. Both sequences were sufficient to drive accumulation of EGFP in the nucleus, with stronger nuclear targeting observed for EGFP-NLS2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). Mutation of NLS2 at three positively charged residues, K414A/R415A/R416A, efficiently blocks nuclear accumulation of mCherry-FMN2 in response to DNA damage (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>)."

We performed these experiments in both control cells expressing a non-target hairpin and an IPO9 shRNA knockdown line.

To assess whether oxidative signaling is involved in regulation of nuclear actin filaments induced by MMS, we generated a construct containing the redox-sensing fluorophore roGFP2 fused with 3\u00d7NLS (roGFP2-NLS) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lohman and Remington, 2008</a>). roGFP2 is variant of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) engineered to introduce 2 cysteines to the interior of the GFP beta barrel, and it has been extensively used to measure oxidation changes in live cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Merksamer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Mehdi et al., 2012</a>)<i>.</i> The roGFP2 excitation spectrum contains 2 peaks, at 488 nm and at 405 nm. In the oxidized form of roGFP2, excitation at 405 nm is increased and excitation at 488 nm is decreased, relative to the reduced form.

For example, many chromatin-remodeling complexes contain monomeric actin or Arps as subunits, but the contribution these subunits make to chromatin remodeling remains poorly understood. In addition, cellular stresses such as ATP and nutrient deprivation, heat shock, and various chemical toxins induce the assembly of cytoplasmic actin bundles as well as cofilin\u2013actin rods in the nucleus. Although they are thought to sense reactive oxygen species (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bernstein et al., 2012</a>), the precise function of nuclear cofilin\u2013actin rods remains unclear. One of the most convincing functions proposed for nuclear actin is regulation of the actin-binding transcription factor MRTF. In this example, serum stimulation of quiescent cells induces assembly of actin filaments in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baarlink et al., 2013</a>). Assembly of filaments in the cytoplasm drives MRTF into the nucleus, while the assembly of filaments inside the nucleus depletes monomeric actin from this compartment and relieves its inhibitory effect on MRTF (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vartiainen et al., 2007</a>). This mechanism relies on the nucleation activity of Diaphanous-family formins, mDia1 and mDia2, and highlights the existence of a stable pool of polymerizable actin monomers inside the nucleus."

In response to DNA damage, these nucleation factors create a variety of actin structures in the nucleus, including long nucleoplasmic filaments, nucleolus-associated filaments, and amorphous clusters. These may represent functionally distinct species or possibly different time points in the evolution of a single structure. Regardless, as judged by the number of 53BP1 foci, nuclear actin assembly promotes clearance of double-strand DNA breaks. In contrast to the role of nuclear actin in MRTF function, however, filament formation appears to be more important than monomer depletion in the response to DNA damage. A functional role specific to filaments is supported by the fact that removing <i>all</i> actin (monomer and polymer) from the nucleus has the same effect on MMS-induced 53BP1 foci as simply inhibiting filament formation by depleting the nucleation factor, FMN2. If monomer depletion were the primary function of DNA damage-induced filaments, then IPO9 knockdown would not have the same effect on DNA repair as filament inhibition."

The nucleation activity of the <i>Drosophila</i> FMN2 homolog, Cappuccino, is regulated by intramolecular contacts between a C-terminal region near the actin-nucleating domain and an N-terminal sequence (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bor et al., 2012</a>). This autoinhibitory interaction is structurally distinct from the DID/DAD interaction that regulates activity of the Diaphanous-family formins. We have identified two nuclear-localization sites in the N-terminus of human FMN2, which also contains two previously discovered DNA damage-induced phosphorylation sites. If human FMN2 is also autoinhibited by an interaction between N- and C-terminal regions, it is possible that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation promotes both nuclear translocation and actin nucleation."

The third possibility is consistent with the minimal co-localization we observe between nuclear actin filaments and 53BP1 foci. Recent studies, however, have also demonstrated that DNA damage alters the mobility of DNA loci, perhaps facilitating their interaction with DNA repair proteins that are expressed at extremely low concentrations (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dimitrova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Min\u00e9-Hattab and Rothstein, 2013</a>). One attractive possibility is that myosin motors in the nucleus may drive clustering of repair components or DSB sites to facilitate homologous recombination. This would be analogous to the role of FMN2/Spire-generated actin filaments in generating contractile structures that link cargo vesicles in mouse oocytes."

Although we observed a 20% decrease in average nucleolar area after MMS treatment, depleting nuclear actin by knocking down IPO9 had no measurable effect on this phenomenon. Given that nucleoli are the sites of rRNA transcription, we speculate that nuclear actin filaments may play a role in rRNA production or export, perhaps promoting stress-induced changes in translation. Clarifying the potential nucleolar functions of actin will require the identification of more nucleolus-associated actin-binding proteins."

The number and size of these clusters increases with increasing doses of genotoxic agents, suggesting that they may be related to pre-apoptotic signaling. Consistent with this idea, we found that blocking nuclear filament assembly inhibits nuclear oxidation induced by high concentrations of MMS. Several prior studies suggested that actin acts as a sensor of cellular oxidation levels. For example, in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, cellular oxidation triggers formation of amorphous \u2018actin bodies\u2019 generated by intermolecular disulfide bonds (<a href=\"#bib13\">Farah and Amberg, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2011</a>). Similar sensing of nuclear oxidation has also been proposed for nuclear cofilin\u2013actin rods, which contain disulfide-linked cofilin oligomers (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bernstein et al., 2012</a>). While more work will be required to determine whether DNA damage-induced nuclear filament clusters are also oxidation sensors, we demonstrate clearly that actin can alter the nuclear redox state. Given that all previously observed cases of nuclear actin assembly are connected to oxidation, we suggest that nuclear actin may be an important mediator of redox signaling."

One common theme, however, appears to be a link between the state of actin in the nucleus and the state of actin in the cytoplasm. For example, both serum stimulation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vartiainen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baarlink et al., 2013</a>) and DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zuchero et al., 2012</a>; and unpublished observations) induce a dramatic increase in cytoplasmic actin polymerization. In both cases, this cytoplasmic actin polymerization correlates with nuclear accumulation of formin-family actin nucleators. We, therefore, speculate that changes in the actin monomer/polymer ratio in the cytoplasm may facilitate nuclear accumulation of actin regulators, coordinating the cytoplasmic and nuclear responses to stimuli."

Non-Target shRNA and Mission shRNAs directed against mDia1, mDia2, cofilin, FMN2, Spire-1, and IPO9 were purchased as bacterial glycerol stocks from Sigma, and lentiviral particles were generated as described above. HeLa cells were transduced with lentiviral particles and split after 8\u201316 hr into media supplemented with 0.3 \u03bcg/ml puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for stable selection. All knockdown constructs were pre-validated by qRT-PCR using the SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Life-Technologies) and run on a Stratagene Mx3005P RT-PCR thermocycler (UCSF Center for Advanced Technology). RNA was insolated using the TRIzol Plus RNA Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). qRT-PCR primers were designed using Primer BLAST (NIH). Knockdowns verified by qRT-PCR were subsequently validated by Western blotting (performed as described in <a href=\"#bib3\">Belin et al., 2013</a> but modified to include 1\u00d7 Detector Block [KPL/Sera Care Life Sciences] as the primary antibody diluent)."

Additional support was provided by a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship (BJB) and a National Institutes of Health Ruth L Kirschstein Predoctoral Fellowship (BJB). Some early experiments for this project were conducted at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. We are grateful to Elizabeth Blackburn and Beth Cimini for use of their DeltaVision microscope and a great deal of technical assistance, including generation of the 53BP1-mTag-BFP2 construct, MT-hTer-47A HeLa RNAi line, and DSB antibody selection and staining conditions. Eric Chow of the UCSF Center for Advanced Technology assisted in providing technical support for design and implementation of qRT-PCR experiments. We thank Sonia Rocha of the University of Dundee, Phil Merksamer from the Ferroz Papa lab, and John James formerly of the Ron Vale lab at UCSF for providing multiple constructs used in this study, as noted in the Methods section. Noah Ollikainen provided helpful comments on the manuscript and advice on figure preparation ad statistical analysis in R. Thank you finally to Jenny Hsiao for gifting a generous quantity of purified human cofilin for generating a cofilin antibody."
