For example, patients with damage to the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex can accurately convey appropriate moral principles and social conventions, but then violate them in the course of their behavior (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bechara et al., 1994</a>). In some cases, this deficit occurs in isolation, with normal behavior in other cognitive domains (<a href=\"#bib12\">Damasio et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fellows, 2011</a>). An impairment in translating knowledge into behavioral goals could be fundamental to many addictive behaviors, compulsive disorders, and psychopathologies."

One way to assess an animal\u2019s knowledge of outcome values is through reinforcer devaluation in the <i>devaluation task</i>. Although the subjective value of a food or fluid outcome is influenced by many factors, such as probability, magnitude, and the effort required to obtain it, the devaluation task isolates a different and independent aspect of subjective value: an outcome\u2019s worth at a particular moment based on the individual\u2019s current state. In one version of this task, monkeys first learn that some objects are associated with one kind of food (food 1), while other objects are associated with a different food (food 2). Next, a selective satiation procedure temporarily devalues one food type, and monkeys are given a series of choice tests in which food-1 objects are pitted against food-2 objects. If monkeys can update the value of expected outcomes and link this information to their goal choices, they will shift these choices away from objects associated with the devalued food, a phenomenon called the <i>devaluation effect</i>. Other kinds of visual stimuli can be substituted for physical objects in these experiments, as in the present experiment."

By inactivating the amygdala of monkeys either before or after the selective satiation procedure, <a href=\"#bib57\">Wellman et al. (2005)</a> showed that neurons in the amygdala need to be active during the satiation procedure for normal value updating to occur. Specifically, inactivation of the amygdala before selective satiation disrupted devaluation effects, whereas inactivation after satiation, but before the choice phase of the experiment, had no effect. Thus, the amygdala is essential for value updating but, once that has occurred, it is no longer essential for making goal choices based on those valuations."

Further, functional interaction of the amygdala and OFC is required (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baxter et al., 2000</a>). The granular prefrontal areas that compose the primate OFC are also essential for representing expected outcomes more generally, including both their sensory properties and subjective value (<a href=\"#bib33\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rudebeck and Murray, 2014</a>), and the agranular OFC areas in rodents have similar properties (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schoenbaum et al., 2009</a>). Within the primate OFC, areas 13 and 11, considered together, are necessary for normal devaluation effects, but area 14 is not (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rudebeck and Murray, 2011</a>). Thus, the functional contribution of the OFC to this kind of value-based goal selection is mediated by the <i>sensory network</i> proposed by <a href=\"#bib10\">Carmichael and Price (1996),</a> which receives inputs from gustatory, olfactory, visceral, and visual sensory areas (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carmichael and Price, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Saleem et al., 2008</a>). Each of these inputs presumably contributes to representations of outcome expectancies. Consistent with this idea, when monkeys view images that predict specific amounts or types of outcomes, the activity of neurons in both areas 13 and 11 signals the expected value of those upcoming rewards (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hikosaka and Watanabe, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tremblay and Schultz, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wallis and Miller, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</a>)."

Little, however, is known about their functional specializations. Anterior\u2013posterior dissociations have been reported in electrophysiological studies in macaques (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mora et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kobayashi et al., 2010</a>), and in functional neuroimaging studies in humans (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sescousse et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Klein-Flugge et al., 2013</a>), but these correlational findings leave open the causal contributions of these two OFC components to behavior. Here we show that they make selective and complementary contributions to reward-based goal selection, and in particular to translating abstract, updated knowledge about outcome valuations into advantageous choices."

Importantly, different pairs of images appeared on each trial. To test whether the OFC contributes to different components of the devaluation effect, we infused the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol hydrochloride (THIP hydrochloride, hereafter THIP) into area 13 or area 11 before and after selective satiation. Infusions administered before the selective satiation procedure inactivated the OFC <i>during</i> the selective satiation procedure as well as during the choice trials of the probe test. Thus, disruption of devaluation effects by THIP infusions before selective satiation would indicate a failure of either value updating or goal selection. Infusion of THIP after the selective satiation procedure inactivated the OFC only during the goal selection in the choice phase of the experiment. Thus, disruption of devaluation effects by THIP infusions after selective satiation would indicate a selective contribution to goal selection.

In separate sessions, saline and THIP were infused before and after selective satiation, and we recorded monkeys choices of food relative to baseline choices of food, just as we had for the probe tests with images. When monkeys could choose between visible foods directly, rather than choosing between images that had previously been paired with food, THIP infusions had no effect on choices, regardless of whether that was measured as a function of proportion shifted, as used for image choices, or as a function of the proportion choice of the nonsated food (repeated-measures ANOVA with factors of region and treatment; for all main effects of region: F<sub>(1,2)</sub> &lt; 8.68, p\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.098; for all main effects of treatment and interactions: F<sub>(2,4)</sub> &lt; 0.29, p\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.764; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, consistent with our earlier work based on permanent lesions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Izquierdo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rudebeck et al., 2013</a>), the reversible inactivations had no discernable influence on satiety mechanisms, and the selective satiation procedure produced the desired effect."

The monkeys had by all indications acquired information about the new, updated value of the food outcome, yet their choices did not reflect this. This observation shows that area 11 is not necessary for updating valuations per se, but rather for the use of this knowledge to choose goals based on visual stimuli associated with predicted food outcomes. In essence, once value updating has occurred, area 11 plays the dominant role and area 13 is no longer needed to guide choices between stimuli based on current valuations. Presumably, storage of the updated value occurred either during or shortly after the selective satiation procedure, a process that depended on area 13, and this information was then broadcast to other areas, including area 11. Inactivation of area 11 immediately before the probe tests prevented the optimal use of this knowledge."

Inactivation of area 11 before the selective satiation procedure, which had no effect on behavior, would have persisted into the choice phase, when THIP infusions into area 11 did cause an impairment. But it is reasonable to expect an impairment to follow choice-phase inactivation of area 11, regardless of how long its neurons had been inactivated. We do not believe that the effect of pre-satiation THIP infusions could have dissipated in time for area 11 to participate in goal selection. Infusion of similar volumes of THIP into the pulvinar produced behavioral effects in monkeys lasting several hours (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wilke et al., 2013</a>), and smaller volumes administered in rat superior colliculus affected behavior for at least two hours (<a href=\"#bib13\">Di Scala et al., 1983</a>), both well beyond the elapsed time between pre-satiation infusion and choice tests in the present study. Instead, our negative results after pre-satiation infusions probably reflect the cooperative function of other prefrontal areas, which would also explain the relatively mild effect of choice-phase area 11 inactivations. The impairment when area 11 was inactive only during goal selection, but not when it was inactive during <i>both</i> value updating and goal selection, suggests that area 11 plays a dominant role in a partially-redundant goal-selection network. Another possibility is that when area 11 was inactivated before the selective satiation procedure, it was effectively taken \u2018offline\u2019, rendering it unable to receive updated valuation signals and therefore unable to participate in goal selection later. According to this account, when area 11 had received updated valuation signals during the satiation procedure it made a significant contribution to goal selection, but otherwise did not. Presumably, neighboring prefrontal areas could mediate goal selection in this circumstance."

One idea posits a serial model (<a href=\"#bib33\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</a>) in which offer values are compared, perhaps in a common currency. The offer with the greater value is selected, and then an action is selected to implement that choice. Another model suggests that value signals could influence processing in visuomotor pathways that plan movements through a mechanism akin to top\u2013down attention and biased competition (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pastor-Bernier and Cisek, 2011</a>). By either model, these influences of current value on choice might be mediated by connections between the OFC and the ventral, medial, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barbas and Pandya, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Carmichael and Price, 1996</a>). The OFC and the VLPFC contribute to multisynaptic pathways to dorsal premotor areas, mainly via dorsal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib49\">Takahara et al., 2012</a>), and cingulate premotor areas, mainly via medial prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib26\">Morecraft and Van Hoesen, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Morecraft et al., 2012</a>).

The anterior component, area 11, plays a critical role in translating this knowledge into goals that produce an advantageous outcome. Importantly, area 11 is needed for choosing which of two visual stimuli to choose when both stimuli are abstractly associated with a particular reward outcome, but not for choices between two visible foods.

One image of the pair was arbitrarily designated as the rewarded image (S+), and the other was designated as the nonrewarded image (S\u2212). The monkey was required to touch one of the two images on the screen. The selected image was then shown with a red frame and flashing red dot in the center. The nonselected image disappeared. If the selected image was the S+, touching it again led to delivery of a \u00bd peanut reward and visual feedback of the image on the screen for an additional 1 s. If the selected image was the S\u2212, then touching it again resulted in the screen going blank. The\u00a0intertrial interval (ITI) was set at 5 s after a correct (rewarded) response, and 10 s after an incorrect (nonrewarded) response. Criterion was set at a mean of 90 percent correct responses over three consecutive 60-trial sessions. Finally, monkeys were required to discriminate 20 image pairs, repeated 3 times each per session. Stimuli were novel at the beginning of training, and general methods were the same as for the single-pair discrimination.

We calculated proportion shifted according to Eq. 1, where F1 and F2 represent choices of the images paired with the two food types on weeks in which that food type was devalued, and subscripts D and N respectively represent the Devaluation day (Day 4) and the day of that same week on which that food was Not devaluated (Day 2).

The reverse was done in a second monkey; CTB was injected into area 13 and Fast Blue into area 11. Both sets of tracer injections were performed unilaterally. Hamilton syringes were inserted into the chamber grid at the same x, y location and to the same depth as for the infusions. After a survival period of 13 days, the monkeys were deeply anesthetized with Euthanasia (0.1 ml/kg, i.v.) and perfused transcardially with normal saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer. The brain was extracted from the skull, blocked, and cryoprotected through a series of glycerols. After 3\u20134 days, the brain was frozen in dry ice and isopentane, and cut in the coronal plane at 40 \u00b5m-thick sections on a sliding microtome. One to two parallel series of sections were immediately mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air-dried, and coverslipped with DPX (Sigma-Aldrich) for the examination of fluorescent tracer Fast Blue. The other series was processed immunohistochemically with the Avidin/Biotin immunoperoxidase method for CTB labeling."

Tissue was then incubated in the primary antibody solution (1:5000 anti-CTB, added to the serum solution consisting of 2% BSA, 5% NRS, and 0.2% TX-100 in PBS) for 65\u2009hr at 4\u00b0C. After several washes in PBS, sections were then incubated in the secondary antibody solution (1:200 anti-goat IgG, added to the same serum solution as described in the previous step) for 1.5\u2009hr at room temperature, followed by another wash in PBS. The sections were then processed with the avidin/biotin staining kit (Vector ABC Elite) for 90 min at room temperature, after which sections were washed in PBS and placed in a 0.035% DAB solution (3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen; Sigma #D5637). After 10 min, approximately 0.0125% hydrogen peroxide was added to initiate the staining reaction. The DAB reaction was stopped when satisfactory contrast was achieved (usually 2\u20135 min). After a final rinse in phosphate buffer, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air-dried, and dehydrated through ascending grades of ethanol concentrations before being cleared in xylenes and coverslipped in DPX (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)."

The basic test was to inject THIP either before or after a satiation procedure (giving the monkey a lot of one kind of treat) and test whether the monkey then altered the proportion of times choosing that treat versus another. They used a very nice within-subject experimental design in which each monkey was tested under a variety of conditions, including infusion of saline or THIP, injection into area 11 or 13, and injection before or after satiation. They found a very clean dissociation between the two regions. Inactivating area 13 prior to the selective satiation procedure impaired the ability of the animal to change its behavior, but if the inactivation occurred later (prior to the choice trials) the animals' performance was normal. In contrast, inactivating area 11 had no effect when it occurred prior to satiation, but disrupted performance if it was inactivated prior to the probe tests. Along with a number of important controls, the results provide strong evidence for a functional dissociation between the two areas: area 13 appears to be responsible for updating the value of stimulus-outcome associations, whereas area 11 appears to be responsible for using those updated values to guide choice."

Inactivation of area 11 before the selective satiation procedure, which had no effect on behavior, would have persisted into the choice phase, when THIP infusions into area 11 did cause an impairment. But it is reasonable to expect an impairment to follow choice-phase inactivation of area 11, regardless of how long its neurons had been inactivated. We do not believe that the effect of pre-satiation THIP infusions could have dissipated in time for area 11 to participate in goal selection. Infusion of similar volumes of THIP into the pulvinar produced behavioral effects in monkeys lasting several hours (Wilke et al., 2013), and smaller volumes administered in rat superior colliculus affected behavior for at least two hours (Di Scala et al., 1983), both well beyond the elapsed time between pre-satiation infusion and choice tests in the present study."

The impairment when area 11 was inactive only during goal selection, but not when it was inactive during bothvalue updating and goal selection, suggests that area 11 plays a dominant role in a partially redundant goal-selection network. Another possibility is that when area 11 was inactivated before the selective satiation procedure, it was effectively taken \u2018offline\u2019, rendering it unable to receive updated valuation signals and therefore unable to participate in goal selection later. According to this account, when area 11 had received updated valuation signals during the satiation procedure it made a significant contribution to goal selection, but otherwise did not. Presumably, neighboring prefrontal areas could mediate goal selection in this circumstance.\u201d"
