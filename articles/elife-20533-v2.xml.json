This instability has been explained by the ability of R-loops to induce DNA damage. Here, we show that persistent R-loops also compromise DNA repair. Depleting endogenous RNase H activity impairs R-loop removal in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, causing DNA damage that occurs preferentially in the repetitive ribosomal DNA locus (rDNA). We analyzed the repair kinetics of this damage and identified mutants that modulate repair. We present a model that the persistence of R-loops at sites of DNA damage induces repair by break-induced replication (BIR). This R-loop induced BIR is particularly susceptible to the formation of lethal repair intermediates at the rDNA because of a barrier imposed by RNA polymerase I."

R-loops can form spontaneously across many genomic loci, but the activity of two endogenous RNases H prevents their accumulation and persistence (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cerritelli and Crouch, 2009</a>). RNase H1 and H2 are highly conserved ribonucleases with the ability to degrade the RNA moiety of a DNA:RNA hybrid. Disrupting the activity of the two enzymes (<i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) has been a useful tool for increasing the persistence of DNA:RNA hybrids and studying the effects of hybrid-induced instability. Indeed, efforts to map R-loops genome-wide have shown that in the absence of RNase H activity, the levels of hybrids formed at susceptible loci increase dramatically (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wahba et al., 2016</a>). This increase in hybrids is associated with increased rates of genome instability that include loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events, loss of entire chromosomes, and recombination at the ribosomal locus (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wahba et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">O'Connell et al., 2015</a>). The RNases H have therefore been implicated as important protectors of genome stability."

Approximately 60% of all transcription in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is devoted to producing ribosomal RNA from about 150 repeated units located in a clustered region on chromosome XII (<a href=\"#bib40\">Warner, 1999</a>). These repeats, at 9.1 kb each, make up about 10% of the budding yeast genome. Accordingly, almost 50% of all R-loops map to the rDNA (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wahba et al., 2016</a>). R-loops found at the rDNA are associated with increased rates of recombination (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wahba et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2013</a>), RNA polymerase pileups (<a href=\"#bib10\">El Hage et al., 2010</a>), and stalled replication forks (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stuckey et al., 2015</a>)."

However, the mechanisms of R-loop induced genome instability remain elusive. Most studies on the mechanisms of hybrid-induced instability have been \u2018damage-centric,\u2019 investigating how R-loops are converted to mutations, single-stranded nicks, and double-stranded breaks (DSBs) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aguilera and Garc\u00eda-Muse, 2012</a>). Current models focus on the involvement of active replication forks that stall or collapse upon encountering the aberrant structure. While this remains an area of active research, we note that any instability event is the result of a complex interplay between the initial damage event and the repair processes that follow. Phenotypes that involve the loss of genetic information (terminal deletions, certain LOH events) imply both that damage occurred and that repair processes failed to accurately maintain the genome. Few studies have investigated how R-loop induced damage is repaired, and it remains possible that defects in repair contribute to instability. This possibility raises several questions. First, do genomic changes induced by R-loops reflect increases in damage events, failures of repair, or both? Second, are specific pathways involved in the repair of R-loop induced damage, and if so, what are they?"

Rad52 is required in almost all homologous recombination (HR) pathways, and in yeast forms bright foci upon induction of DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lisby et al., 2001</a>). Most foci appear in the S/G2-M phases of the cell cycle and have a moderate rate of repair \u2013 almost all spontaneous Rad52-GFP foci are resolved within 40 min (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lisby et al., 2003</a>). Consistent with phenotypes of increased genomic instability, <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> mutants display an increase in Rad52-GFP foci. A large fraction of these foci appear to co-localize with the nucleolus and form in a window between late S and mid-M (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stuckey et al., 2015</a>). Here, by monitoring the persistence of Rad52 foci across the cell cycle in RNase H mutants, we implicate DNA:RNA hybrids in the disruption of DNA repair. We show that topoisomerase I works at the rDNA to prevent these disruptions from becoming lethal events. Furthermore, we identify a new role for the RNases H in preventing break-induced replication (BIR) from repairing R-loop induced DNA damage."

Using Rad52-GFP foci as a marker for DNA damage, we observed that 27% of <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> cells had foci, a ten-fold increase over wild-type, <i>rnh1\u2206,</i> and <i>rnh201\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Consistent with the notion that persistent DNA damage uniquely affects the double mutants, the growth of the double mutant, but not either of the single mutants, was dramatically impaired by the deletion of <i>RAD52</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Previous characterization of the double mutant also reported elevated foci and Rad52-dependent growth (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stuckey et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lazzaro et al., 2012</a>). Thus, by measures of Rad52-GFP foci and Rad52-dependent growth, cells lacking RNase H1 and H2 had a larger fraction of persistent R-loop induced damage than wild-type cells or cells lacking only one of the RNases H. This persistent damage could have arisen from increased R-loop induced damage and/or an inability to efficiently repair that damage."

The increase in foci in <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> cells did not appear to be due to a cell-cycle dependent increase in hybrid formation, as cytological staining revealed similar levels of R-loops in cells staged in G1, S, and M, with around 95% of all nuclei staining for presence of R-loops (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Therefore, the increase in damage during the S/G2-M window in <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> cells likely occurred because hybrids were more efficiently converted to damage.

After the expected increase of Rad52-GFP foci upon the completion of S-phase, we observed a gradual disappearance of foci.

A number of observations suggested that alleles of <i>TOP1</i>, which encodes the major topoisomerase I in yeast, might be good candidates for doing so. Top1 is thought to clear or prevent R-loops and stalled RNA polymerase I (RNA pol I) complexes at the ribosomal locus by resolving supercoiling (<a href=\"#bib10\">El Hage et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Drolet et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mass\u00e9 and Drolet, 1999</a>). A potential synergistic relationship between Top1 and the RNases H came from the observation that while cells with either the <i>top1\u2206</i> mutation or the <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> mutations are viable, the <i>top1\u2206 rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> mutant is inviable (<a href=\"#bib10\">El Hage et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, treatment of <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> cells with the Top1 inhibitor camptothecin led to increased Rad52-GFP foci that co-localized with the nucleolus (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stuckey et al., 2015</a>). Encouraged by these results, we used the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system to create a conditional <i>TOP1-AID</i> allele in wild-type, the two single RNase H mutants, and the double RNase H mutant. We then reassessed viability and DNA damage phenotypes."

In contrast, <i>TOP1-AID</i>, <i>rnh1\u2206 TOP1-AID</i>, and <i>rnh201\u2206 TOP1-AID</i> mutants grew well. Thus, the synergistic lethality occurred only when both RNases H and Top1 were inactivated. Similarly, when exponential cultures of these strains were treated with auxin for four hours, Rad52-GFP foci did not increase in <i>TOP1-AID</i>, <i>rnh1\u2206 TOP1-AID</i> or <i>rnh201\u2206 TOP1-AID</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, foci nearly doubled in the <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206 TOP1-AID</i> cells compared to an untreated control, such that a large majority of <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206 TOP1-AID</i> cells (85%) had foci. Furthermore, after four hours of treatment with auxin, over 98 percent of <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206 TOP1-AID</i> cells were arrested pre-anaphase at the G2-M checkpoint (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a>).

The lethality of <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206 top1\u2206</i> cells provided a powerful genetic tool to do so. We reasoned that suppressor mutations that confered viability to a strain lacking the RNases H and Top1 could either prevent damage from occurring or allow that damage to become repairable. These suppressor mutations could inform us about the processes that convert R-loops to DNA damage or the mechanisms by which R-loop mediated damage is repaired. To isolate these suppressors, we generated independent cultures of an <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206 top1\u2206</i> strain that contained a plasmid carrying the <i>RNH1</i> and <i>URA3</i> genes. Plating these cultures on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) selected for cells that had lost the plasmid and thus carried a suppressor mutation that allowed them to divide despite their <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206 top1\u2206</i> genotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). DNA sequencing of the suppressor strains identified novel mutations in the Pif1 helicase and in RNA polymerase I.

BIR is an HR-dependent repair process that can occur in G2-M when only one end of a DSB is available for recombination (<a href=\"#bib26\">Malkova et al., 2005</a>). This end can be captured by homologous sequences and used as a primer for replication (<a href=\"#bib31\">Saini et al., 2013</a>). Break-induced replication is extremely processive and can extend the length of entire chromosomes. The Pif1 helicase contributes to this processivity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Davis and Symington, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wilson et al., 2013</a>). We hypothesized that BIR might be the pathway that repaired hybrid-induced damage and that the <i>PIF1-E467G</i> allele modulated BIR."

Briefly, these strains carry an inducible HO endonuclease cut site centromere-distal to an incomplete <i>URA3</i> gene on chromosome V. Upon induction of a DSB, a telomere needs to be added to the chromosome to restore viability to the cell. This repair can proceed with BIR using homology from an incomplete <i>URA3</i> repair template on the opposite arm. The repair template is situated in a position that requires either 30 or 80 kb of BIR for telomere addition, the latter being less efficient. Repair by BIR results in a fully functional <i>URA3</i> gene, thereby conferring the ability to grow on media lacking uracil."

In contrast, while <i>PIF1-E467G</i> cells also had reduced rates BIR, viability remained at wild-type levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). Thus, BIR was compromised, but an alternative pathway stepped in to promote telomere addition.

This alternative pathway was poorly activated in <i>pif1-m2</i> cells, as evidenced by a depressed level of viability. The increase in repair was not due to increased non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), as less than one percent of cells of all genotypes retained a telomeric drug resistance marker\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). Additionally, all strains efficiently induced DSBs, as evidenced by the failure to PCR-amplify DNA surrounding the cut site after HO induction (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

We observe an increase in Rad52 foci only in cells lacking both RNases H (<i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i>). The increase in foci begins at the exit from S-phase and continues until mid-M. We show that this damage induces a significant pre-anaphase delay by activating the Rad9-dependent checkpoint. When measured in a bulk population, foci disappear slowly such that even after most cells have lost foci and completed cell division, a subset of cells retain foci and remain arrested pre-anaphase. This phenotype is indicative of an inability to efficiently repair damage. The depletion of Top1 in <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> cells appears to exacerbate this problem by generating more foci that lead to lethal, irreparable damage and permanent arrest. Importantly, disrupting factors that modulate BIR allows for repair of these foci and restores cell division without reducing the initial level of damage. This demonstrates that the inability to repair damage, not the level of damage per se, in <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> cells is the root cause of the inability to proceed through the cell cycle. Taken together, these results suggest that DNA:RNA hybrids inhibit DNA repair and that a critical role of the RNases H is to remove hybrids so that efficient repair can occur."

An important clue comes from the fact that the lethality of <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206 top1\u2206</i> cells can be suppressed by mutations in RNA pol I, an enzyme whose function is limited to transcribing ribosomal DNA. This result strongly suggests that the lethal damage we observe is due to DNA damage in the rDNA. A number of observations corroborate this conclusion. The rDNA is the biggest source of R-loops in cells, accounting for almost 50% of all hybrids in yeast (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wahba et al., 2016</a>). A previous study showed that Rad52-GFP foci co-localize with the nucleolus in <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> cells and in <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> cells depleted of Top1 activity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stuckey et al., 2015</a>). In addition, Top1 inactivation preferentially induces genome instability in the rDNA (<a href=\"#bib10\">El Hage et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Christman et al., 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">1988</a>). These results suggest that BIR at the rDNA may be particularly challenging in the presence of hybrids and even more challenging in the absence of Top1. We therefore propose that the induction of hybrids in the rDNA generates a barrier to the processivity of DNA replication during BIR, thereby slowing repair (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Further inactivation of Top1 causes elevated hybrids and stalled polymerases, which we hypothesize terminally block BIR replication fork progression. This trapped BIR intermediate is an aberrant structure that then leads to lethality."

BIR is known to be a multi-step process in which strand invasion happens rapidly followed by a long delay before replication initiates (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jain et al., 2009</a>). This delay would explain the slow disappearance of hybrid-induced Rad52-GFP foci in <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206</i> cells. After this pause, Pif1 and Pol32 are required for processivity of the BIR replication fork. We suggest that inhibition of these two factors causes the invading strand to dissociate before it can reach the blocks imposed by the hybrids and/or RNA polymerases.

The high copy number of direct repeats present at the rDNA makes the locus an ideal substrate for this repair pathway. Additionally, the kinetics of end resection (~4 kb/hr) and the size of a single rDNA repeat (9.1 kb) suggest that the repair of a DSB using SSA would take around 2\u20133 hr per repeat (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fishman-Lobell et al., 1992</a>).

This conclusion came from directly limiting RNase H activity in cells, but other conditions may also effectively limit RNase H. For example, many RNA biogenesis mutants induce hybrid formation and elevate genome instability (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wahba et al., 2016</a>). The genome instability of these mutants can be suppressed by overexpression of RNase H, implying that RNase H activity becomes limiting when hybrid levels exceed a threshold. It has been assumed that this instability results only from increased damage induced by the persistence of R-loops. However, in light of our results, it is likely that limiting RNase H activity in these mutants also allows hybrids to interfere with repair. Finally, the particular sensitivity of the highly transcribed rDNA repeats is intriguing given that many cancer cells contain highly transcribed amplicons. These amplicons may be not only sites of R-loop formation and R-loop induced DNA damage, but also sites of improper repair."

After PCR confirmation, several of the SNPs detected by whole-genome sequencing were found to have arisen in the outgrowth step before genomic DNA extraction and were therefore secondary, non-causative mutations (12/25 SNPs). To test if the remaining 13 primary SNPs were causative for the phenotype, suppressor strains were crossed to strain JA290a (<i>Mat<b>alpha</b> rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206 top1\u2206 +pRS316-RNH1</i>). Diploids were sporulated and tetrads were dissected. Only four SNPs were found to consistently segregate with the <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206 top1\u2206</i> genotype in spores that had lost the pRS316-RNH1 complementation plasmid. Of these four SNPs, the two <i>RPA190-V1486F</i> hits are likely to be clonal because they arose from the same initial outgrowth culture. The three remaining suppressors \u2013 <i>RPA190-K1482T, RPA190-V1486F,</i> and <i>PIF1-E467G</i> \u2013 are discussed here. All three suppressors were built into <i>rnh1\u2206 rnh201\u2206 top1\u2206</i> strains to confirm that they were causitive before being built into <i>TOP1-AID</i> strains."

Using Rad52-GFP foci as readout of chromosome breaks, it is shown that DNA damage accumulates in <i>rnh1 rnh201</i> mutants, which are defective for the two RNases H encoded by the yeast genome. It is also shown that DNA damage is further increased in the absence of topoisomerase I. Since the triple mutant <i>rnh1 rnh201 top1</i> is inviable, a conditional Top1 mutation is used in <i>rnh1 rnh201</i> mutants using an AID construct to identify suppressors. Interestingly, suppressors are a BIR-defective allele of the Pif1 helicase and a mutant of the large subunit of RNA polymerase I, the main RNAP involved in the transcription of ribosomal RNAs. Based on these and other observations, it is proposed a model in which R-loops induce the formation of chromosome breaks that cannot be properly repaired by homologous recombination, presumably because hybrids interfere with the resection of DNA ends. This would prevent the capture of the second end and would therefore promote BIR. For reasons that are not entirely clear at this stage, the BIR mediated completion of DNA replication in S/G2 would be particularly difficult at the rDNA array, which would induce mitotic defects and irreparable chromosome breaks."

                    "text": "A main concern relates to the question of whether the rDNA array is involved in this process. Indeed, it has been reported by the Maki lab (Ide et al., 2007, Mol Cell Biol 27, 568) that the rDNA array is extremely tolerant to replication defects. For instance, a massive depletion of active origins in the <i>orc2-1</i> mutant leads to a Rad9-dependent G2/M arrest, but deletion of the RAD9 gene rescues the viability of <i>orc2-1</i> cells at the restrictive temperature, presumably because yeast cells can tolerate the loss of a large fraction of their rDNA array. It is shown that the deletion of RAD9 in <i>rnh1 rnh201</i> TOP-AID cells does not restore viability, which argues that the incomplete replication of the rDNA array might not be the only cause of the loss of viability of the triple mutant. To address this possibility, completion of DNA replication of the chromosome XII relative to the other chromosomes should be monitored by PFGE. If their model is correct, the mobility of chromosome XII should be particularly affected, relative to other chromosomes."

Indeed, it has been reported by the Maki lab (Ide et al., 2007, Mol Cell Biol 27, 568) that the rDNA array is extremely tolerant to replication defects. For instance, a massive depletion of active origins in the orc2-1 mutant leads to a Rad9-dependent G2/M arrest, but deletion of the RAD9 gene rescues the viability of orc2-1 cells at the restrictive temperature, presumably because yeast cells can tolerate the loss of a large fraction of their rDNA array. It is shown that the deletion of RAD9 in rnh1 rnh201 TOP-AID cells does not restore viability, which argues that the incomplete replication of the rDNA array might not be the only cause of the loss of viability of the triple mutant. To address this possibility, completion of DNA replication of the chromosome XII relative to the other chromosomes should be monitored by PFGE. If their model is correct, the mobility of chromosome XII should be particularly affected, relative to other chromosomes.</i> "

As for the stalled replication forks seen in the Stuckley, et al. paper, we expect them to act like the Rad52-GFP foci in this study. That is, in <i>rnh1\u2206 rn201\u2206 top1\u2206</i> cells in the presence of the <i>PIF1</i> or <i>RPA190</i> alleles, replication forks will still stall in G2-M.
