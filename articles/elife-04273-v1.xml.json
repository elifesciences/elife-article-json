PepT1 and PepT2, the mammalian proton coupled peptide transporters (POTs), function to assimilate and retain diet-derived peptides and play important roles in drug pharmacokinetics.  A key characteristic of the POT family is the mechanism of peptide selectivity, with members able to recognise and transport &gt; 8000 different peptides. Here we present thermodynamic evidence that in the bacterial POT family transporter PepT<sub>St</sub>, from <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i>, at least two alternative transport mechanisms operate to move peptides into the cell. Whilst tri-peptides are transported with a proton:peptide stoichiometry of 3:1, di-peptides are co-transported with either 4 or 5 protons. This is the first thermodynamic study of proton:peptide stoichiometry in the POT family and reveals that secondary active transporters can evolve different coupling mechanisms to accommodate and transport chemically and physically diverse ligands across the membrane."
