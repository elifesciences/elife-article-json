This feature makes them a convenient system to study reprogramming during regeneration. We find that massive damage inflicted to the posterior or the dorsal compartment of the wing disc causes a transient breakdown of compartment boundaries, which are quickly reconstructed. The cells involved in the reconstruction often modify their original identity, visualized by changes in the expression of developmental genes like <i>engrailed</i> or <i>cubitus interruptus</i>. This reprogramming is mediated by up regulation of the JNK pathway and transient debilitation of the epigenetic control mechanism. Our results also show that the local developmental context plays a role in the acquisition of new cell identities: cells expressing <i>engrailed</i> induce <i>engrailed</i> expression in neighbor cells."

During the reconstruction process some cells are reprogrammed and change their original compartmental identity. We provide evidence that the identity changes are associated with gain of activity of the JNK pathway and with relaxation of the epigenetic control by the Pc-G and trx-G genes. In addition, we suggest that the identity changes observed are induced by a novel mechanism by which isolated cells acquire the identity of their neighbours."

Therefore, we have examined whether it plays a role in the lineage transgressions we observe.

In discs of genotype <i>dpp</i>-LHG&gt;LexO<i>-hid hh</i>-Gal4&gt;UAS-<i>puc</i> Gal80<sup>TS</sup> the 17 to 29\u00baC temperature shift causes ablation of the Dpp domain in the A compartment and at the same time prevents JNK activation in the P compartment due to the over-expression of the negative regulator <i>puc</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Martin-Blanco et al., 1998</a>).

This implies <i>the novo</i> activation of identity genes. We speculated about the possibility of an induction mechanism by neighbor cells. That is, a cell in a naive state could be induced by its neighbors to express the same identity gene. The reason behind this speculation was the realization that identity changes observed appear to be influenced by the local developmental context, that is, the cells may change from anterior to posterior, but keep the overall wing identity. This suggested that the local developmental environment could play a role in determining the acquisition of the new identity. There is a recent observation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Garaulet et al., 2008</a>) that dorsal compartment cells expressing <i>en</i> appear to induce the <i>en-LacZ</i> reporter in ventral cells located in their vicinity."

The first experiment consisted of filling the anterior wing compartment almost entirely with GFP-marked clones of cells expressing <i>en</i>, but leaving a few islands of unmarked anterior cells without exogenous <i>en</i> activity. We find that these unmarked cells often activate the endogenous <i>en</i> gene, as indicated by the expression of the <i>en</i>-<i>lacZ</i> insert (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E\u2032\u2032</a>) and also by the presence of the En protein (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B\u2032\u2032</a>). The gain of <i>en</i> activity is associated with down regulation of the A compartment markers Ci and Ptc (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2032\u2032,E\u2032\u2032</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D\u2032\u2032</a>).

It suggests that the induction process requires the receiving cells to be largely surrounded by inducing cells. This experiment was also performed at 17\u00b0C, a temperature at which the Gal4 system is less active and therefore the levels of <i>en</i> over-expression in the clones are lower. The result (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) is that <i>en</i> is also non-autonomously activated under these conditions."

To exclude the possibility that the label-negative cells arise not from transgression from the healthy compartment but from a few cells that did not undergo excision of the stop cassette, the authors could mark healthy cells (in this case A cells) with the Lac-Z marker in the following genotype: dpp-LexA LexOp-Flp act&gt;&gt;LacZ hh-Gal4 tub-gal80ts UAS-hid. Slightly more difficult to explain, but not impossible, is the presence of marked clones in the A compartment: perhaps the dying cells induce occasional ectopic Flp expression in neighboring A cells? The controls support their model, but it is very hard to rule out that the Hid genetic manipulation might affect the normally precise control of Flp activity and/or Gal4 expression under Hh control. The twin clone experiment is harder to explain away, and perhaps is the best evidence for a breakdown of the boundary, but this is not given as much prominence as the main Hh driven \u03b2gal approach.

An example of disrupted-to-healthy transgression is shown in the middle of the pouch (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The twin clones are shown in the prospective notum and in a few key experiments, transgressions appear to occur preferentially at an epithelial fold. It also appears that JNK upregulation occurs specifically near folds. Transgression at these various locations seem to differ morphologically and it is not clear that they are equivalent. Therefore, it is necessary to define which types of transgression are analyzed in the different genetic backgrounds (at folds or not; towards the disrupted compartment or away from it)."

However, the hedgehog gene itself is under control of epigenetic regulation (Maurange and Paro, 2002), raising the possibility that the alterations in transgression size might be due to higher or lower activities of hh-GAL4 (and hence expression of hid). This could be tested by monitoring the activity of hh-Gal4 in the different genetic backgrounds using a reporter (e.g., UAS-GFP)."

They show that this is indeed the case for cells in the anterior compartment. In the posterior compartment, where en-lacZ is normally active, however, en-lacZ is apparently repressed in clones of cells expressing Engrailed (panel B'). This raises concerns about the physiological relevance of the expression level of Engrailed in the clones and thus the validity of the conclusion. The authors could lower expression levels by using an expression system independent of the highly active Gal4/UAS system, by reducing the temperature (the Gal4 system is less active at 18C), or by co-expressing Gal80ts. Furthermore, as the authors acknowledge, engrailed normally becomes active in the A compartment at late stages of discs development. They suggest that this is not true for en-lacZ. They conclude therefore that non-autonomous engrailed expression represents a true fate change (A to P). However, the nature of the <i>en-lacZ</i> allele is not specified. This is important because at least one <i>en-lacz</i> line (known as <i>xho25 en-lacZ</i>) is upregulated in the A compartment (Blair 1992). Therefore the conclusion that engrailed is activated in a non-autonomous manner needs further evidence, perhaps with higher quality anti-En staining and a demonstration that Ptc expression is suppressed in these cells."
