Opposite transition of pathogens from activating to non-activating conditions is poorly understood. Interestingly, variability in the expression of virulence genes upon infection enhances colonization. In order to systematically detect the role of phenotypic variability in enteropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> (EPEC), an important human pathogen, both in virulence activating and non-activating conditions, we employed the ScanLag methodology. The analysis revealed a bimodal growth rate. Mathematical modeling combined with experimental analysis showed that this bimodality is mediated by a hysteretic memory-switch that results in the stable co-existence of non-virulent and hyper-virulent subpopulations, even after many generations of growth in non-activating conditions. We identified the <i>per</i> operon as the key component of the hysteretic switch. This unique hysteretic memory switch may result in persistent infection and enhanced host-to-host spreading."

Opposite transition of pathogens from activating to non-activating conditions is poorly understood. Interestingly, variability in the expression of virulence genes upon infection enhances colonization. In order to systematically detect the role of phenotypic variability in enteropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> (EPEC), an important human pathogen, both in virulence activating and non-activating conditions, we employed the ScanLag methodology. The analysis revealed a bimodal growth rate. Mathematical modeling combined with experimental analysis showed that this bimodality is mediated by a hysteretic memory-switch that results in the stable co-existence of non-virulent and hyper-virulent subpopulations, even after many generations of growth in non-activating conditions. We identified the <i>per</i> operon as the key component of the hysteretic switch. This unique hysteretic memory switch may result in persistent infection and enhanced host-to-host spreading."

Bacteria that enter the human body face many challenges, and this kind of pre-adaptation could help them to invade humans and overcome the immune system. However, this hypothesis had not previously been tested in a bacterium called enteropathogenic <i>E.coli</i>, which infects the intestines and is responsible for the deaths of many infants worldwide."

Diversification upon infection is also related to antigenic variation, which is a\u00a0key strategy to eluding the acquired immune response of the host (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kamada et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stewart et al., 2011</a>)."

Diversification processes, not linked to DNA alteration have been attributed to noise in gene expression that can be further amplified by regulatory motifs such as excitatory dynamics (<a href=\"#bib64\">S\u00fcel et al., 2006</a>) positive feedback leading to bi-stability (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ozbudak et al., 2004</a>) and ultrasensitivity (<a href=\"#bib66\">Temme et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rotem et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Levine et al., 2012</a>).

In contrast, \u2018non-activating conditions\u2019 include a broad spectrum of conditions that do not resemble the host environment. Variability in the expression of virulence genes is observed when the bacteria are exposed to activating conditions (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nielsen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">De Angelis et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Somvanshi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Atack et al., 2015</a>). This process has been extensively studied in <i>Salmonella</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ackermann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Temme et al., 2008</a>). <i>Salmonella</i> employ a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject the host cells with virulence factors. Interestingly, upon shifting from non-activating to activating conditions, <i>Salmonella</i> exhibit bimodal T3SS expression. The burden of T3SS expression, together with its bimodal expression, results also in growth rate bimodality (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ackermann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Diard et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hautefort et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sturm et al., 2011</a>).

The major virulence factors of EPEC are a T3SS, similar to that of <i>Salmonella</i>, and a type IV pili termed the bundle forming pili (BFP) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gayt\u00e1n et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hazen et al., 2016</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2015b</a>). EPEC can cause symptoms ranging from asymptomatic infection to a devastating lethal disease in infants and spreads in the host population by the fecal-oral route (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hazen et al., 2016</a>). Whereas the phenotypic variability of virulence upon shifting from non-activating to activating conditions has been extensively studied (e.g. <a href=\"#bib2\">Arnoldini et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Diard et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sturm et al., 2011</a>), the opposite process (i.e., the behavior of the pathogen population upon shifting from activating to non-activating conditions) is poorly understood. In vivo, shifts from activating to non-activating conditions can occur transiently within the host and also in the process of host-to-host spread."

Our analysis revealed a novel long-term hysteretic memory-switch in EPEC, which mediates bimodality in virulence expression. Whereas bimodal virulence expression is observed as a transient behavior in activating conditions, the transition from activating to non-activating conditions resulted in the stable co-existence of non-virulent bacteria and a hypervirulent subpopulation that continued to express full virulence even after many generation of growth in non-activating conditions. It is likely that this hysteretic switch is common in pathogenic bacteria, ensuring persistence of infection and improved host-to-host spreading."

In contrast, overnight growth in Luria-Bertani liquid medium (LB) is considered as \u2018non-activating conditions\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hazen et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Leverton and Kaper, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Puente et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rosenshine et al., 1996</a>). We searched for growth heterogeneity in EPEC upon transition from activating to non-activating conditions. As a negative control, the non-pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> K-12 was also evaluated. Cultures were grown under activating or non-activating conditions and plated on LB agar plates (i.e., non-activating conditions). Analysis of the colony growth dynamics, using ScanLag (<a href=\"#bib41\">Levin-Reisman et al., 2010</a>) scanners, showed that EPEC and K-12 from the overnight LB cultures displayed unimodal distributions of colony appearance times (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). In contrast, colonies of EPEC that originated from activating culture conditions exhibited a bimodal distribution of appearance time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>); the \u2018activated\u2019 K-12 culture maintained a unimodal distribution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Further analysis showed that the bimodality in EPEC colony appearance time was due to a slightly reduced growth rate of the bacteria in the late-appearing colonies (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These differences in the growth rates resulted in bimodal colony size distribution at 17 hr post-plating (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>).

However, already after 3 hr of growth in activating conditions, we observe a high proportion of SMALL morphotypes, suggesting that the switching rate from BIG to SMALL in activating conditions is higher than in non-activating conditions. Our model predicted that longer exposure to activating conditions would lead to a higher percentage of the SMALL morphotype. In order to evaluate the predictive value of the model and the switching rates under activating conditions, we diluted a stationary phase culture into DMEM and monitored BIG and SMALL colony ratios over time. We found that the switching from BIG to SMALL was tenfold faster under activating conditions than under non-activating conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and Materials and methods-Mathematical model). As a result, within a few hours under activating conditions, the SMALL morphotype dominated the culture. Similarly to growth in LB, stationary phase resets the culture to unimodality (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Taken together, these results show that although the bimodal switch generates variability both under activating and non-activating conditions, the higher switching rate under activating conditions results in a fast increase of the SMALL to BIG ratio. In both conditions, stationary phase resets the culture to a unimodal BIG population."

                                "text": "Activating conditions, which were shown above to increase the SMALL/BIG ratio, are known to activate the expression of key transcriptional regulators of EPEC virulence including Ler, GrlA, PerA, and PerC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, reviewed in <a href=\"#bib13\">Clarke et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mellies et al., 2007</a>). We tested for possible involvement of these regulators in the BIG to SMALL switch and found that Ler and GrlA are not required for the bimodal colony size phenotype (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, the EPEC strain cured of the EAF plasmid, which encodes the <i>perABC</i> operon, lost the capacity to generate bimodality and produced only BIG colonies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Complementing this strain with the EAF plasmid restored the bimodal phenotype. To identify the EAF plasmid genes required to establish the bimodality, we examine mutant strains \u0394<i>per</i>A, \u0394<i>perC</i>, and \u0394<i>bfpA</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Notably, only the \u0394<i>perA</i> mutant failed to exhibit bimodality. Importantly, PerA is the autoactivator and thus the <i>perA</i> mutant is deficient in expressing the entire <i>perABC</i> operon. Complementing the \u0394<i>perA</i> strain with a low copy number plasmid, containing the <i>perABC</i> operon with its native regulatory region transcriptionally fused to <i>gfp</i> (pPerABC-GFP)restored the bimodality. In this case, the SMALL colonies appeared later and were more abundant than in the <i>wt</i> strain, probably due to excessive PerABC expression. These results show that the <i>per</i> operon is required for the co-existence of the BIG and SMALL morphotypes, whereas PerC, GrlA, Ler, T3SS biogenesis, and BFP formation were not required for colony size bimodality (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To find whether PerA or PerB underlie the bimodality, we deleted different fragments from the pPerABC-GFP plasmid resulting in pPerA-GFP, pPerB-GFP or pPerAB-GFP. Notably, we kept the native regulatory region implying that in all cases PerA is required for expression. We transformed the \u0394<i>perA</i> mutant with plasmids expressing PerA-GFP, PerB-GFP or PerAB-GFP. Whereas complementation of \u0394<i>perA</i> with PerA-GFP or PerB-GFP expressing plasmids resulted in unimodal colony morphotypes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), the PerAB-GFP plasmid restored bimodality, indicating that both PerA and PerB are required for the bimodality. Microscopic observations show that GFP expression is bimodal in pPerAB-GFP plasmids, while uniformly high in pPerA-GFP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). PerB and GFP cannot be expressed from pPerB-GFP in the absence of PerA and accordingly no GFP was observed in \u0394<i>perA</i> mutant containing this plasmid (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Expression of GFP from this plasmid was restored in the <i>wt</i> EPEC (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results show that both PerA and PerB expression are required for the co-existence of the BIG and SMALL morphotypes. To determine whether other EAF plasmid factors are required for the growth bimodality, we transformed <i>E. Coli</i> K-12 MG1655 strain with the above pPer plasmids and found that co-expression of PerA and PerB is sufficient for induction of bimodality also in this strain. In agreement with the results obtained in the \u0394<i>perA</i> EPEC strain, PerA or PerB alone failed to generate bimodality (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). These results show that PerAB expression generates a bimodality of growth also without the EAF plasmid, although the phenotype was milder (i.e. the growth difference between the two morphotypes is smaller) (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We subjected a culture of the \u0394<i>perA</i> EPEC complemented with pPerABC-GFP to activating conditions and measured GFP expression by microscopy (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We detected a bimodal expression of the <i>perABC-gfp</i> operon. Furthermore, the bacteria that did not express GFP were larger and divided more rapidly than those that expressed GFP. To correlate between <i>perABC-gfp</i> expression and colony size, we used Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to collect separately the GFP-OFF and GFP-ON bacteria (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Each subpopulation was then plated and analyzed by ScanLag (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). The results showed that the GFP-OFF bacteria grew in BIG colonies, whereas the GFP-ON bacteria generated almost exclusively SMALL colonies. Similar results were obtained using wild-type EPEC transformed with pPerABC-GFP, whereas no bimodality was observed with control pZS11*GFP plasmid expressing GFP from a synthetic constitutive promoter (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, these results show that during growth in activating conditions, a bimodal expression of the <i>perABC</i> operon is established in progenitor cells that lead to bimodality in colony size upon plating and growth in non-activating conditions."

Under activating conditions, we observed that Ler expression from chromosomal <i>ler-gfp</i> transcriptional fusion was unimodal (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib8\">Berdichevsky et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Roe et al., 2004</a>). This was in contrast to the bimodal <i>perABC-gfp</i> expression in the same conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). We predicted, however, that upon shifting the culture from activating to non-activating conditions, which suppresses GrlA activity, only the sub-population that expresses <i>perABC</i> will continue to express <i>ler,</i> resulting in bimodal Ler expression. As predicted, we found that upon shifting from activating to non-activating conditions, Ler-GFP expression was reduced in approximately 50% of the bacterial population and became bimodal (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,D</a>). Time-lapse microscopy of bacteria taken from BIG and SMALL colonies showed that, as expected, Ler expression was uniformly high in the SMALL population but bimodal in the BIG population (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that the bimodal expression from <i>perABC</i> during activating conditions does not result in bimodal Ler expression since GrlA, which is redundant to PerC, activates <i>ler</i> expression regardless of whether PerC is expressed or not. However, upon shifting to non-activating conditions and the bimodal expression of <i>perABC</i> drives the bimodality of Ler expression."

Accordingly, the entire population switches to a virulent state upon activation, characterized by unimodal and high <i>ler</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, State 1). In contrast, <i>per</i> expression during activation is typically bimodal, although prolonged activation eventually shifts the population to SMALL (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). When transferred to non-activating conditions, the <i>per</i>-ON bacteria remain hypervirulent, expressing both Ler and PerABC, leading to SMALL colony morphotype (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, State 2). This hypervirulent state is maintained for an extremely long time but is \u2018reset\u2019 to the non-virulent state during stationary phase (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, State 3). When a \u2018reset\u2019 population is subjected to non-activating conditions the majority remains in the BIG morphotype (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, State 4). This insight leads to several predictions. Firstly, the SMALL morphotype should express virulence factors downstream of both <i>ler</i> and <i>per</i> (i.e., BFP and T3SS), even after many generations of growth in non-activating conditions. Secondly, the BIG colony morphotype should consist mainly of non-virulent bacteria with\u00a0~20% of hypervirulent ones. Finally, the\u00a0deletion of the <i>per</i> operon should not prevent the activation of virulence (i.e., T3SS expression can be driven through the GrlA-Ler path), but erase the hysteretic switch, and thus <i>ler</i> expression and virulence of all bacteria, should decline as soon as the \u0394<i>perA</i> bacteria are transferred to non-activating conditions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>)."

BfpA, an important constituent of the type IV pilli, was used as readout for PerA activity, and the T3SS proteins EspB and Tir were used as readout for Ler activity. As an additional negative readout of virulence, we used flagellin (FliC<sub>H6</sub>), which is known to be repressed by GrlA (<a href=\"#bib36\">Iyoda et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). As expected, in EPEC, EspB, Tir, and BfpA, but not FliC were highly expressed upon growth in activating conditions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,C</a>: State 1). Similar expression patterns were seen in SMALL colony bacteria, despite the fact that at least 20 generations had passed since the transition from activating to non-activating conditions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,C</a>: State 2). In contrast, bacteria from BIG colonies showed low expression levels of all virulence factors and high levels of FliC. The residual expression of BfpA, EspB, and Tir by the BIG colony bacteria is consistent with the prediction of\u00a0~20% SMALL variants in the BIG population (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,C</a>: State 4).

We showed that PerA and PerB are sufficient for this hysteretic switch. We found that when exposed to virulence-activating conditions all EPEC bacteria upregulate expression of T3SS virulence genes, unlike the bimodal virulence expression observed in <i>Salmonella</i>. However, we found that the EPEC virulent population is bimodal for expression of the <i>per</i> regulated genes, resulting in two coexisting virulent sub-populations of bacteria, planktonic (<i>per</i>-OFF) and aggregative (<i>per</i>-ON), with different infection and invasion abilities. The latter population constitutively expresses both BFP and T3SS for many generations, rapidly attaches to host cells as microcolonies, delivers effectors into the host cell, and invades it. This rapid invasion may protect the bacteria against the host immune system and establish persistent infection (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tuchscherr et al., 2011</a>)."

This <i>per</i>-ON long-term memory may allow the pathogen to overcome transit through niches of non-activating conditions without a drop in virulence level. An extreme case of this type of transit is the host-to-host transit through the fecal-oral route. In addition, the long-term memory <i>per</i>-ON state may set the stage for further diversification within this subpopulation, possibly creating a range of infective phenotypes, each adapted to a different niche and/or stage of infection within the host intestine. Alternatively, the hysteretic switch that enables the coexistence of two different phenotypes may be attributable to bet-hedging (i.e. to risk spreading in the absence of a predictable environment). The SMALL morphotype infects host cells more rapidly but bears the cost of expressing virulence genes and exposure to the immune system, whereas the BIG morphotype grows faster and is less immunogenic. Notably, bimodality is stable mainly under non-activating conditions, suggesting that insufficient cues from the environment regarding bacterial residence inside or outside the host may promote a bet-hedging strategy (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kussell and Leibler, 2005</a>)."

In EPEC, expression of the Ler master regulator, and thus expression of T3SS, is high and unimodal under activating conditions. Redundant activation of the <i>ler</i> promoter by independent regulators (GrlA and PerC) ensures that all bacteria express virulent genes during activation. In contrast, <i>Salmonella</i> displays bimodal T3SS expression upon growth under activating conditions and during initial infection (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hautefort et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sturm et al., 2011</a>). The <i>per</i>-switch acts hysteretically, locking the expression of <i>ler</i> and activation of virulence in an \u2018ON\u2019 state, even when bacteria are switched back to non-activating conditions. Thus in EPEC, <i>ler</i> expression becomes bimodal only when the bacteria are transferred to non-activating conditions, resulting in the co-existence of non-activated bacteria and bacteria that are already primed for infection through constitutive expression of BFP and T3SS. Importantly, we were able to evaluate the rates of switching between the two EPEC phenotypes and found that the rate from ON to OFF is extremely slow (several weeks), even under non-activating conditions. A long-lived ON state has been observed also in <i>Salmonella</i> (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sturm et al., 2011</a>), but upon shifting to non-activating conditions, regulators of virulence decay within 1 to 2 hr (<a href=\"#bib66\">Temme et al., 2008</a>)."

Recent reports comparing the genome sequences of a large number of EPEC clinical isolates show that EPEC is an umbrella name for a collection of <i>E. coli</i> strains belonging to diverse phylogenetic branches that acquired independently, through horizontal gene transfer, a pathogenicity island encoding T3SS (the LEE island) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ingle et al., 2016</a>). Notably, most of these EPEC strains also acquired plasmids containing the <i>perABC</i> operon (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ingle et al., 2016</a>). Furthermore, strains containing both the LEE and plasmids encoding <i>perABC</i> and <i>bfp</i> operons cause a more severe disease (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hazen et al., 2015b</a>). Hazen et al. proposed that the contribution of PerA might be related to regulation of additional virulence-related genes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hazen et al., 2015b</a>). Our findings suggest that <i>perABC</i> also enhances the fitness of infecting EPEC by facilitating formation of long-term memory and stable phenotypic bimodality. The contribution of the <i>per</i>-switch to virulence in vivo could not be tested since an animal model for EPEC is not available. Pathogens closely related to EPEC, including enterohemorragic <i>E. coli</i> (EHEC) and <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> (CR), do not carry the <i>perABC</i> operon. Interestingly, however, heterogeneity in virulence is observed in these pathogens (<a href=\"#bib55\">Roe et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kamada et al., 2015</a>), but the involved switch and whether it is also hysteretic have not been studied."

This design was essential to test whether PerA can drive bimodality through its autoregulation.

Whereas complementation of PerB-GFP expressing plasmids resulted in unimodal colony morphotypes, the PerAB- GFP plasmid restored bimodality, indicating that PerA and PerB are sufficient for the bimodality. Microscopic observations show that GFP expression is bimodal in pPerAB-GFP plasmids, while PerB and GFP cannot be expressed from pPerB-GFP in the absence of PerA and, accordingly, no GFP was observed in \u0394<i>perA</i> mutant containing this plasmid (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Expression of GFP from this plasmid was restored in the <i>wt</i> EPEC (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results show that <i>perA</i> and <i>perB</i> expression are required for the co-existence of the BIG and SMALL morphotypes. We have now added description and results for this experiment in the subsection \u201cPerA and PerB are sufficient for the bimodal phenotype\u201d."

The results are very similar to the results obtained with the \u0394<i>perA</i> mutant, i.e. PerA and PerB together restore the bimodality of growth. These results suggest that EAF plasmid factors are not essential for the growth bimodality. We note that the growth bimodality is milder in the MG1655 strain. Description and results for this experiment are in the aforementioned subsection."
