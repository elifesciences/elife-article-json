To detect this wide variety of volatiles, most organisms have evolved large families of receptor genes that typically encode 7-transmembrane proteins expressed in the olfactory neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buck and Axel, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Clyne et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">de Bruyne and Baker, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vosshall et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dahanukar et al., 2005</a>). Each volatile chemical in the environment is thought to interact with a specific subset of odorant receptors depending upon odor structure and binding sites on the receptor. This precise detection and coding of odors by the peripheral olfactory neurons are subsequently processed, transformed and integrated in the central nervous system to generate specific behavioral responses that are critical for survival such as finding food, finding mates, avoiding predators etc (<a href=\"#bib51\">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2006</a>)."

The challenges for overcoming the rate-limiting steps are enormous. First, volatile chemical space is immense, more than 2000 odors in the environment have been catalogued from a small fraction of plant sources alone (<a href=\"#bib31\">Knudsen et al., 2006</a>). Second, the complete three-dimensional structures of the 7-transmembrane odorant receptor proteins have not yet been determined and modeling of protein\u2013odor interactions and sophisticated virtual screening methods are not yet possible except in rare instances (<a href=\"#bib50\">Triballeau et al., 2008</a>).

In order to do so we focused our attention on one of the most comprehensive quantitative data sets available, where measurements of responses of 24 <i>Drosophila</i> odorant receptors to a panel of 109 odorants are known that provides a rich resource for structure-activity type analyses (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>). We devised a method to identify molecular structural properties that are shared amongst the activating odorants for each receptor. We then utilize information about these shared molecular features of active odorants, that are presumably required for binding to a receptor, to perform in silico screens on a chemical space of &gt;240,000 chemicals, including a large collection of naturally occurring and biologically important odors, and identify the top 500 hits for each of the odorant receptors (Ors). We then use single-unit electrophysiology to validate a subset of predictions for 9 Ors in vivo and find that our method met an overall success rate of \u223c71% in identifying novel ligands. This approach is specific since testing shows a low (10%) rate of finding ligands while using non-predicted odors. This approach allows us to create a computationally predicted peripheral coding map of a large chemical space, which substantially improves our ability to predict and investigate peripheral olfactory coding and provides a powerful tool for the discovery of novel ligands for Ors, some of which may be ecologically important or useful for behavior modification."

Although this general approach has been useful in the area of pharmaceuticals (<a href=\"#bib37\">Martin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Keiser et al., 2009</a>), receptor\u2013odor analysis presents significant additional challenges. Not only are odorant molecules generally smaller in size than pharmaceuticals (average MW of known odors \u223cthreefold less than FDA approved pharmaceuticals [<a href=\"#bib55\">Wishart et al., 2008</a>]) and therefore offer fewer structural features for differentiation, they are also detected by the receptors with specificity at extremely low concentrations in the volatile phase (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kreher et al., 2008</a>). Additionally, odorant receptors are differentially tuned and can sometimes appear not to follow distinct structural rules: odors that look structurally different can strongly activate the same receptor, while odors that appear very similar may have very different levels of activity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>). For example, while hexanal and \u03b3-octalactone are structurally very different, they both strongly activate Or85b (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>). Alternatively, while hexanal and pentanal are structurally very similar, they have very different activities against Or85b (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>)."

In order to test whether non-optimized approaches would be able to identify similarities in shape of known activators we compared four different approaches: Cerius2 (Accelrys Software Inc), Dragon (Talete), Maximum-Common-Substructure (MCS) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cao et al., 2008b</a>), and atom-pair (AP) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carhart et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 2008a</a>). Cerius2 and Dragon represent collections of 200 and 3224 molecular descriptors, respectively, that calculates values for a broad range of chemical properties such as molecular weight, functional group counts, and in the case of Dragon, three-dimensional relationships within molecules. The AP method compares shortest path distances between all atom pairs in a molecule. Lastly, MCS identifies the largest two-dimensional substructure that exists between two compounds. Using each of these approaches, we computed distances between 109 odors that had previously been tested against 24 Ors from <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>). These represent most of the <i>Or</i> genes expressed in the <i>Drosophila</i> antenna (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>)<i>.</i> Upon comparison, we find that none of the four methods were vastly superior and that each method varied in the ability to group known activating odorants \u2018actives\u2019 close together in distance as measured for each Or using a method called accumulative-percentage-of-actives (APoA)(<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Reynolds, 2002</a>) (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and value of the area-under-the-curve (AUC). Ultimately, Dragon and Cerius2, which utilize a large number of diverse molecular descriptor values to describe each odor structure, performed better than AP or MCS, suggesting that a more diverse set of descriptors is better at explaining Or activity than two-dimensional measures alone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Atom-Pair and MCS were subsequently ignored from further development."

We reasoned that rather than using entire Dragon or Cerius2 descriptor sets, which likely includes a number of measurements for features irrelevant for ligand-binding to an individual Or, judiciously selecting subsets of molecular descriptors suited to cluster activators for an individual receptor may be more effective at defining an Or-specific chemical space. To test this hypothesis, we used a Sequential-Forward-Selection (SFS) method to incrementally create unique optimized descriptor subsets for each Or from an initial combined set of 3424 descriptors from Dragon and Cerius2 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Whitney, 1971</a>) (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Molecular descriptors can be categorized from 0 to 3 dimensions. Zero-dimensional (0-D) descriptors define features that can be viewed as not directly being shape dependent, such as molecular weight or vapor pressure. On the other end of the scale, three-dimensional (3-D) descriptors define features of molecules in three-dimensional space, such as the distance between two atoms of an odor molecule. Interestingly, we find an overwhelming preference for three-dimensional and two-dimensional descriptors compared to one-dimensional and zero-dimensional descriptors, suggesting that structural shape features are more important for receptor\u2013odor interactions (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>).

This operation was repeated five times for each receptor, each time selecting a different 20% as withheld from the training set. The entire fivefold operation was repeated five times for each receptor and a mean ROC curve representing the prediction accuracy determined. This analysis was possible for 12 <i>Ors</i> which had &gt;6 known ligands that activated &gt;100 spikes/s.

The nine receptors were selected on the basis of previous functional mapping studies that enable us to unambiguously identify the antennal olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) they are housed in (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hallem et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Couto et al., 2005</a>). We systematically tested each predicted receptor\u2013odor combination using single-unit electrophysiology to record from the ORNs to which these 9 Ors have been previously mapped (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hallem et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Couto et al., 2005</a>). We find that a majority of the predicted ligands evoked responses from the target ORNs; \u223c71% evoked either activation (&gt;50 spikes/s above the spontaneous activity) or inhibition (&gt;50% reduction in spontaneous activity [reverse agonist activity]) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). These cutoffs were selected based on the study from which the training set was obtained and has been used in other studies in the past that use this type of recordings (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kreher et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, the mean vapor pressure of activating odors (11.84 Torr) is 7.5 times higher than of inactive odors (1.58 Torr), raising the possibility that some inactive odors may not be volatilized and delivered at adequate levels to the ORNs. Additionally, we find that \u223c13% of the predicted compounds we tested showed an inhibitory effect on baseline activity of the respective neuron (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). These inhibitors were identified by virtue of structural similarity to known activators suggesting that they may bind to similar sites on the receptor. Thus as an additional benefit our approach may provide a method to identify inhibitors as well. Such inhibitors would not only provide important tools to investigate mechanisms of odorant receptor inhibition but could also be used in blocking specific odor-mediated behaviors. Consistent with our observations three of the receptor\u2013odor interactions had been previously identified independently as well, Or22a (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pelz et al., 2006</a>), and Or49b (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hallem et al., 2004</a>). The electrophysiological analysis provides the most important validation of our Or-optimized descriptor-based in silico screen."

This represents a high degree of specificity, especially considering that the Or-optimized descriptor method did not incorporate any additional computational screening to rule out non-target activators. Additionally, when we plot the percentage of odors that validated as activators when tested using electrophysiology (considering both predicted and non-target receptor\u2013odor interactions), we find that activity is strongly related to predicted odor ranking (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Odors which rank closest to known activators for each Or, particularly within the top 500 hits, are far more likely to be activators than odors further away, and there is a drastic drop-off in activating odors present beyond the 1000 rank. We see the same trend if we plot mean activity of odors for the same ranking divisions. Highly ranked odors have a far higher mean activity than distantly ranked odors."

We used hierarchical cluster analysis to create trees that represent the various receptors based on: shared descriptors selected; known activity-based relationships (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>); degree of overlap of predicted ligands; and amino acid sequence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We found that the maximum overlap in Or relationships is retained between the descriptor and the activity trees, and the descriptor and the cross activity trees with 11 out of 24 Ors present in subgroups that are common in both cases. However, only two subgroups (yellow and grey) are conserved across the three trees. The largest shared overlap existing in the descriptor tree suggests that the Or-optimized descriptors link the known and the predicted receptor\u2013odor interactions and that our analysis may expand upon odorant receptor activity relationships beyond those previously known from the training data. We also found that the phylogenetic tree has fewer relationships conserved with each of the trees, consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hallem et al., 2004</a>) supporting the idea that, while the most conserved amino acid residues in the Ors provide the structure of the tree, they do not correlate strongly with ligand specificity."

Surprisingly, we find that only 25% of compounds from the \u2018natural\u2019 odor library found in the top 500 predictions for each Or are predicted to activate multiple Ors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, lower left panel). If we consider compounds from the Pubchem library in the top 500 predicted activators for each receptor, we observe further reduction in the proportion of across-receptor activating compounds (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, upper right). Consistent with this prediction we find that cross-activation by ligands functionally evaluated in this study for nine receptors is lower than that reported previously using ligands of comparable strength for the same nine receptors (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, lower right panel).

Although this study had a relatively modest success rate of \u223c25% at predicting untested odorants as activators (by applying the same 50 spikes/s threshold for comparison), it also highlighted that structure-based ligand prediction is a viable method for further development. In another interesting analysis a Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) model was applied to describe odor-activity for <i>Drosophila</i> Ors. Using cheminformatics, important amino acid residues were identified using information from orthologous Or sequences identifying potential odor-binding regions, which was postulated to be 15 angstroms deep and 6 angstroms wide (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guo and Kim, 2010</a>). These studies, along with ours, suggests that computational approaches could have great utility in study of sensory receptors.

In the future, application of machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to the receptor-optimized molecular descriptor sets, may be useful to further increase the predictive ability.

In the current model of combinatorial coding emphasis is placed on the notion that combinations of several odorant receptors detect the majority of volatile chemicals, with the exception of pheromones and CO2. One possible explanation for this disparity could be that our predictions are fundamentally conservative in nature because we focus only on structurally similar ligands and 7-transmembrane heteromeric receptors may also contain additional unexplored binding sites. Another possibility is that previously tested subsets of odors were potentially selected on the basis of strong responses in electroantennograms and behavior assays, which could bias selection of cross-activating odors. In fact, complex fruit odor blends activate fewer Ors than the number activated by individual odorants at comparable concentrations using electrophysiology (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>) and Calcium imaging (<a href=\"#bib45\">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</a>). The architecture of the olfactory code therefore appears to integrate two different models. On the one hand, most odors are detected by a few Ors from the repertoire, which may enhance the specificity of the olfactory system for detection of a large number of odors. On the other hand, 15\u201320% of odors are predicted to activate several Ors (up to 50%) at the same time, which may serve to aid the olfactory of the system in discriminating between fine concentration changes of important stimuli by having Ors tuned to low and high concentrations such as shown for Or42a and Or42b (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kreher et al., 2008</a>)."

A separate compound-by-compound descriptor distance matrix was calculated using the 3424 descriptor values for training odors calculated by Dragon and Cerius2. Activating compounds for each Or were identified individually through activity thresholds, as described above. The correlation between the compound-by-compound activity (CbCA) and compound-by-compound descriptor distance matrices were compared for each actively classified compound, considering their distances to all other compounds. The goal was to identify molecular descriptors that best correlated with activity. To achieve this we applied a sequential forward selection (SFS) approach to identify optimal descriptors for each Or (<a href=\"#bib54\">Whitney, 1971</a>). The SFS functioned by iteratively building a list of molecular descriptors for a single Or by maximally increasing the correlation between the CbCA and CbCD matrices. In the first iteration the values for each single molecular descriptor were used to create CbCD matrices. The rows corresponding to activating compounds were compared to the same rows of the CbCA matrix by correlation. The descriptor which best described the activity (results in the highest correlation between descriptor and activity) was retained. In the second iteration the best single descriptor was combined with all possible descriptors and correlations are calculated again, resulting in a best two-descriptor combination. The process was continued in this fashion to iteratively search for additional descriptors with each iteration aiming to further increases in correlation values. In this manner, the size of the optimized descriptor set increases by one in each iteration, as the best descriptor set from the previous step is combined with all possible descriptors to find the next best descriptor. This process is halted when all possible descriptor additions in an iteration fails to improve the correlation value from the previous step. Molecular descriptors can be selected multiple times for each Or, effectively creating weights for descriptors, as a descriptor that was selected twice will have double the importance when predicting activity of the odor libraries. This whole process is run independently for each Or resulting in unique descriptor sets that are optimized for each Or."

For each independent validation the dataset was divided into five equal sized partitions containing roughly 22 compounds each. During each run, one of the partitions is selected for testing, and the remaining four sets are used for training. The training process is repeated five times with each unique odorant set being used as the test set exactly once. For every training iteration, a unique set of descriptors was calculated from the training compound set. These descriptors were then used to calculate distances of the test set compounds to the closest activating compound, exactly as we use to predict ligands in our ligand discovery pipeline. Once test set compounds have been ranked by distance from closest to furthest to a known activating in the training set, a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis is used to analyze the performance of our computational ligand prediction approach. Using ROC we were able to determine our predictive ability for the 12 receptors. This validation could be performed only on receptors for which sufficient training odors had previously been identified. We consider this to consist of at least one very strongly activating known odor (&gt;150 spikes/s) and at least five strongly activating odors (&gt;100 spikes/s), thus allowing for at least one activating odor for each of the five test sets in the cross-validation (DmOr7a, DmOr9a, DmOr10a, DmOr22a, DmOr35a, DmOr43b, DmOr12, DmOr59b, DmOr67a, DmOr67c, DmOr85b, DmOr98a). Test set validations for all 12 Ors were combined and a single ROC curve representing an average across all Ors was plotted (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

The achievements include: 1) by validating 71% of the 141 experimentally tested odor-receptor pairs, the authors expanded the existing dataset by a significant amount (it would be useful for the authors to determine the precise number and add to the revised text); 2) the 19 Ors <b>\u00d7</b> top 500 odorants matrix could constitute a much larger odor-receptor pairs that have a good chance to be authentic; 3) the same method can in principle be applied to other organisms, after experimentally determining a reasonably rich matrix of receptor-odor pairs. Overall the manuscript is of high technical quality. We would therefore like to invite the authors to revise the manuscript by addressing the following specific critiques."

First, they can only predict more ligands based on receptors that have already been experimentally tested against a large number of ligands. Second, they predicted ligands for only 19 Ors; although technically it may constitute the \u201cmajority\u201d of ORNs that utilize Ors, it is certainly not a \u201cmajority\u201d of \u223c50 ORN types in adult Drosophila (as a significant fraction of ORNs utilize Irs). Third, the validated 71% came from only 9 Ors; it is unclear whether this can be generalized to the other untested Or classes. Fourth, there is no evidence that any of the agonists or antagonists identified in silico are better (higher affinity) or more likely to be the true biologically relevant ligands for these receptors than those identified in small chemical libraries based on ecologically reasoning (i.e., the training set)."

If these are classes of descriptors then how many descriptors from the original set of over 3,000 are actually being used, and what are they? And how do they appear to be relevant to odor quality? One of the issues with the similar analysis performed by Haddad was that the descriptors (there determined by a PCA analysis) seemed to have little obvious relevance to odor quality. Is the optimized method presented here an improvement on that? The description of the SFS approach does not provide any detail as to how each incremental descriptor was chosen to grow the set. Was this done by a purely statistical or machine learning method or did the investigators use some intuition regarding the likelihood of the descriptor to be relevant to odor character?"

That would be clearer and more useful, especially if it shows something new or unexpected. Showing all the interactions creates an attractive graphic, but not one that is informative."

This provides a wealth of useful data. While several of these descriptors are very specific and represent high dimensional graph based theory, a number of selected descriptors are easily understood such as functional group counts and atom types descriptors. Through this table readers will be able to identify which functional groups and 2D fingerprints are most important for a particular receptor and specialists will be able to utilize them in their own analysis such as the prediction pipeline we have created."
