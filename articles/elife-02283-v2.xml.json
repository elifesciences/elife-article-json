Previous crystal structures of a homologous archaeal sodium and aspartate symporter showed that a dedicated transport domain carries the substrate and ions across the membrane. Here, we report new crystal structures of this homologue in ligand-free and ions-only bound outward- and inward-facing conformations. We show that after ligand release, the apo transport domain adopts a compact and occluded conformation that can traverse the membrane, completing the transport cycle. Sodium binding primes the transport domain to accept its substrate and triggers extracellular gate opening, which prevents inward domain translocation until substrate binding takes place. Furthermore, we describe a new cation-binding site ideally suited to bind a counter-transported ion. We suggest that potassium binding at this site stabilizes the translocation-competent conformation of the unloaded transport domain in mammalian homologues."

Previous crystal structures of a homologous archaeal sodium and aspartate symporter showed that a dedicated transport domain carries the substrate and ions across the membrane. Here, we report new crystal structures of this homologue in ligand-free and ions-only bound outward- and inward-facing conformations. We show that after ligand release, the apo transport domain adopts a compact and occluded conformation that can traverse the membrane, completing the transport cycle. Sodium binding primes the transport domain to accept its substrate and triggers extracellular gate opening, which prevents inward domain translocation until substrate binding takes place. Furthermore, we describe a new cation-binding site ideally suited to bind a counter-transported ion. We suggest that potassium binding at this site stabilizes the translocation-competent conformation of the unloaded transport domain in mammalian homologues."

The transporter domain then carries the sodium ions and glutamate through the cell membrane and releases them into the cell.

EAATs terminate neurotransmission events supporting memory formation and cognition, and also prevent excitotoxicity caused by overstimulation of glutamate receptors. Dysfunction of EAATs is linked to neurological disorders, poor recovery from stroke and traumatic brain injuries (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yi and Hazell, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sheldon and Robinson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). To maintain steep trans-membrane glutamate gradients, EAATs transport one substrate molecule together with three sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) and one proton. After their release into the cytoplasm, counter-transport of one potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) resets the transporter for the next cycle (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zerangue and Kavanaugh, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Levy et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Owe et al., 2006</a>)."

Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, like EAATs, is a homo-trimer (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gendreau et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yernool et al., 2004</a>). Each protomer consists of a central scaffolding trimerization domain and a peripheral transport domain containing the substrate and ion binding sites (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boudker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Reyes et al., 2009</a>). When bound to Na<sup>+</sup> and L-asp (\u2018fully bound\u2019 from here on), each transport domain moves by \u223c15 \u00c5 across the membrane from an outward- to an inward-facing position, in which the substrate binding site is near the extracellular solution and the cytoplasm, respectively (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reyes et al., 2009</a>). Structurally symmetric helical hairpins, HP1 and HP2, occlude the bound substrate from the solvent and are thought to serve as gates (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boudker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Huang and Tajkhorshid, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Shrivastava et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Reyes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">DeChancie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Focke et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zomot and Bahar, 2013</a>). Two Na<sup>+</sup>-binding sites (Na1 and Na2), neither of which directly coordinates the substrate, were identified crystallographically using thallium (Tl<sup>+</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boudker et al., 2007</a>). The location of the third Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site is being debated (<a href=\"#bib21\">Holley and Kavanaugh, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang and Tajkhorshid, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Larsson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bastug et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Teichman et al., 2012</a>). A highly conserved non-helical Asn310-Met311-Asp312 (NMD) motif interrupts trans-membrane segment (TM) 7 (see below). It lines the back of the substrate- and ion-binding sites and is involved in binding of the ligands (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rosental et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tao et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rosental and Kanner, 2010</a>). The main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn310 contributes to Na1 site, while the side chain of Met311 protrudes between the substrate, Na1 and Na2 binding sites (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boudker et al., 2007</a>)."

                        "text": "Symport requires that neither the substrate nor the ions alone are efficiently transported (<a href=\"#bib6\">Crane, 1977</a>). Therefore to traverse the membrane, the transport domains of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAATs must be loaded with both Na<sup>+</sup> ions and substrate. To complete the transport cycle, the transport domain of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> must also translocate readily when it is free of both solutes (apo), while in EAATs it requires binding of a K<sup>+</sup> ion. To establish the structural underpinnings of these processes, we determined crystal structures of the outward- and inward-facing states of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in apo and ions-only bound forms (<a href=\"#tbl1 tbl2 tbl3\">Tables 1, 2 and 3</a>). We find that the apo transport domain shows identical structures when facing outward or inward. While ligand-binding sites are distorted, the domain remains compact, suggesting that it relocates across the membrane as a rigid body, similarly to when it is fully bound (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reyes et al., 2009</a>). Ion binding to Na1 site, located deep in the core of the transport domain, triggers structural changes that are propagated to the extracellular gate HP2, at least in part, by the side chain of Met311 in the NMD motif. Consequently HP2, which in the apo form is collapsed into the substrate binding and Na2 sites, frees the sites, assuming conformations more similar to the conformation observed in the fully bound transporter. We suggest that these Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent structural changes underlie the high cooperativity of Na<sup>+</sup> and substrate binding, which is thought to be one of the key coupling mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib36\">Reyes et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, in the structure of Na<sup>+</sup>-bound outward-facing Glt<sub>Ph</sub> we observe opening of HP2 tip, which may facilitate L-asp access to its binding site and prevent the inward movement of the Na<sup>+</sup>-only bound transport domain, as previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib14\">Focke et al., 2011</a>). Remarkably, soaks of apo Glt<sub>Ph</sub> crystals in Tl<sup>+</sup> reveal new cation-binding sites within the apo-like protein architecture. One such site overlaps with the substrate-binding site. Because binding of a cation to this site would compete with binding of Na<sup>+</sup> and the transported substrate, it is well suited to serve as a binding site for a counter-transported ion. We propose that the closed translocation-competent conformation of the transport domain free of Na<sup>+</sup> and substrate is intrinsically stable in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> but not in EAATs, in which K<sup>+</sup> binding at the newly identified site is required, coupling transport cycle completion to K<sup>+</sup> counter-transport."

When fully bound, Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-R397A crystallizes in the outward-facing state, like wild type Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, except that L-asp coordination is slightly altered because the mutant is missing the key coordinating side chain of Arg397 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bendahan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boudker et al., 2007</a>). These results suggest that R397A is suitable to capture the apo and ions-only bound outward-facing states for their structural characterization. However, removal of Arg397 may affect local electrostatics, potentially altering ion binding; thus these studies should be interpreted with caution. Apo Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-R397A also crystallized in an outward-facing conformation that is similar to the structure reported for a close Glt<sub>Ph</sub> homologue (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jensen et al., 2013</a>). To obtain an apo inward-facing state, we used Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-K55C-A364C mutant trapped in the inward-facing state upon cross-linking with mercury (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reyes et al., 2009</a>) (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The positions and orientations of the transport domains relative to the trimerization domains remain essentially unchanged in the apo and fully bound forms of Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-R397A and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In contrast, the conformations of the transport domains themselves differ significantly. Most remarkably, the apo conformations of the transport domain are nearly identical in the outward- and inward-facing states (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) and are therefore independent of the transport domain orientations and crystal packing environments."

In HP2, the last helical turn of HP2a unwinds, and HP2a together with the loop region at HP2 tip collapse into the substrate and Na2 binding sites. Within the NMD motif, the side chain of Asn310 rotates away from TM3 and partially fills the empty Na1 site, while the side chain of Met311 undergoes an opposite movement, flipping away from the binding sites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Finally, TM3 bends away from the NMD motif, particularly around Thr92 and Ser93 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Notably, these residues together with the side chain of Asn310 form one of the proposed third Na<sup>+</sup>-binding sites (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang and Tajkhorshid, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bastug et al., 2012</a>).

For these mutants, generated in the context of unconstrained wild type Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and inward cross-linked Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup>, we measured the dependence of L-asp dissociation constant on Na<sup>+</sup> concentration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). While this dependence is very steep for the wild type Glt<sub>Ph</sub> constructs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Reyes et al., 2013</a>) and nearly as steep for the M311L mutants, it is substantially shallower for the M311A mutants. The most parsimonious interpretation of these results is that M311A mutation reduces binding cooperativity between the substrate and Na<sup>+</sup> ions. However, it is also possible, though we think unlikely, that the mutation abrogates ion binding at one or more Na<sup>+</sup>-binding sites in the tested concentration range (1\u2013100 mM). Mutating the equivalent methionine to smaller residues in EAAT3 also resulted in less steep dependence of the ionic currents on Na<sup>+</sup> concentration (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rosental and Kanner, 2010</a>). Based on these results, we hypothesize that Met311 is key to the allosteric coupling between the Na1, L-asp and Na2 sites. Consistently, bulky methionine or leucine residues are found at this position in \u223c85% of glutamate transporter homologues. However, it should be noted that methionine is conserved in the Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAATs, while a characterized proton-coupled homologue has leucine at this position (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gaillard et al., 1996</a>). Hence, it is possible that the methionine thioether, which is proximal to both Na1 and Na2 sites, plays a direct role in Na<sup>+</sup> binding."

Therefore, we crystallized Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-R397A in the presence of 400 mM Na<sup>+</sup>, but in the absence of L-asp. We also soaked crystals of apo Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup> in Tl<sup>+</sup>, an ion with strong anomalous signal that seems to mimic some aspects of Na<sup>+</sup> in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAATs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boudker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tao et al., 2008</a>). The obtained outward- and inward-facing structures pictured the transport domains in conformations overall similar to those observed in the fully bound transporter: straightened TM3, Met311 pointing toward the binding sites, extended helix in HP2a and HP2 tip raised out of the substrate binding site (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>). Indeed, the structure of Tl<sup>+</sup>-bound Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup> is indistinguishable from the fully bound Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup> and both Na1 and Na2 sites are occupied by Tl<sup>+</sup> ions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The structure of Na<sup>+</sup>-bound Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-R397A differs significantly from the fully bound Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-R397A only at the tip of HP2 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, also see below). The coordinating residues at the Na1 site are correctly positioned and the site is likely occupied by a Na<sup>+</sup> ion. The Na2 site still shows a distorted geometry: the last helical turn of HP2a points away from the site due to the altered conformation of the tip of HP2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Collectively, our results demonstrate that binding of the coupled ions, notably at the Na1 site, is sufficient to trigger isomerization of the transport domain from the apo conformation to the bound-like conformation. The energetic penalty associated with this isomerization likely explains why Na<sup>+</sup> ions alone bind weakly to the transporter (<a href=\"#bib36\">Reyes et al., 2013</a>). This experimental observation contrasts with highly favorable calculated binding energies (approximately \u221210 kcal/mol for Na1) that were obtained using fully bound protein conformation and where the reference ion-free state is the same as the bound state (<a href=\"#bib29\">Larsson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bastug et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Heinzelmann et al., 2013</a>)."

This opening is smaller than the opening observed previously in the structure of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in complex with the blocker L-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boudker et al., 2007</a>), and it is hinged at two well-conserved glycine residues at positions 351 and 357 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Interestingly, among the nine amino acids forming the tip in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (residues 351 to 359), five are glycines in the consensus sequence generated for the glutamate transporter family, although not all are present in each homologue (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

In this structure, the transport domain tilts towards the trimerization domain but does not yet undergo a significant translation toward the cytoplasm. We find that such intermediate state with the opened tip of HP2 can be achieved without major steric clashes, while further progression of the transport domain to the inward-facing position could be impeded because the tip is likely to clash with TM5 in the trimerization domain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Also in the inward-facing state HP2 is packed against the trimerization domain and cannot open in a manner observed in the outward-facing state.

One site, termed Na2', involves residues of HP2 and TM7a that form the Na2 site, but in a different ion coordinating geometry due to the conformational difference in HP2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The second site, termed Ct, overlaps with the L-asp binding site and is formed by the side chains of highly conserved Asp394 and Thr398 in TM8 and main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of HP1 and HP2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). Tl<sup>+</sup> soaks of the outward-facing apo Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-R397A also showed no conformational changes of the transport domain, with Tl<sup>+</sup> binding at the Ct site, but not at the Na2' site (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>).

                                "text": "The functional relevance of these sites is speculative at present. However, it is remarkable that the Ct site is positioned exactly at the same place as the amino group of the bound L-asp and share several coordinating moieties. Therefore, binding of a cation at the Ct site and binding of the substrate are mutually exclusive. Because the Ct site is observed only in the apo-like conformation, cation binding at this site would also inhibit the transition into the bound-like conformation upon Na<sup>+</sup> binding at the Na1 site. Finally, the Ct site is observed in both the inward- and outward-facing states, suggesting that the apo-like transport domain could carry the ion across the membrane. These are the exact properties expected for the K<sup>+</sup>-binding site in EAATs. Moreover, it has been previously proposed that K<sup>+</sup> binds to EAATs at a similar position (<a href=\"#bib21\">Holley and Kavanaugh, 2009</a>). Most remarkably, in an insect K<sup>+</sup>-independent dicarboxylate transporter, an asparagine to aspartate mutation at the position equivalent to Asp394 in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> changes the transporter substrate specificity to amino acid glutamate, and also leads to dependence on K<sup>+</sup> counter-transport (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Therefore this aspartate plays a key role in both binding the amino group of substrate and coupling to K<sup>+</sup> counter-transport. Consistently, Asp394 in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> coordinates both the amino group of the bound substrate and Tl<sup>+</sup> in the Ct site. Notably, while Tl<sup>+</sup> mimics, to some extent, Na<sup>+</sup> ions in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAATs, it is a better mimic of K<sup>+</sup> ions in EAATs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boudker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tao et al., 2008</a>)."

Interestingly, we observed a small, but reproducible structural change in several crystals examined: HP1 and TM7a that form the transport domain cytoplasmic surface moved slightly towards TM8, with the tip of HP1 detaching from that of HP2 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This movement is observed clearly in one protomer (chain B in 4P3J), in which these helices are not involved in crystal packing contacts. It is reminiscent of the isomerization of the structurally symmetric HP2 and TM8a on the extracellular side of the domain observed upon the transition from bound to apo forms (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). It was suggested previously that HP1 participates in intracellular gating in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reyes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">DeChancie et al., 2010</a>). Indeed, the observed movement of HP1 generates a small opening, leading to the substrate and Ct sites (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and it is reminiscent of the movement observed in molecular dynamics simulations (<a href=\"#bib9\">DeChancie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zomot and Bahar, 2013</a>).

Closure of HP2, coupled to L-asp and Na2 binding, allows translocation. After the release of the ligands into the cytoplasm by as yet an unknown gating mechanism, the domain is in a compact apo state, and returns to the extracellular side. Notably, binding of cations to the inward-facing state does not lead to a crystallographically observed gate opening that would impede translocation. However, Na<sup>+</sup> affinity in this state is only \u223c250 mM (<a href=\"#bib36\">Reyes et al., 2013</a>), and it will remain largely unbound when facing the cytoplasm. Hence, uncoupled Na<sup>+</sup> transport should be limited. In EAATs, an open conformation of the gates might be more favored in the apo state, and K<sup>+</sup> binding at the Ct site might be required to stabilize translocation-competent conformation of the apo transport domain."

Consistently, previous spectroscopic studies showed that the transport domains continuously sample the outward- and inward-facing positions with nearly equal probabilities either when bound to Na<sup>+</sup> and L-asp or when free of the solutes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akyuz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Erkens et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Georgieva et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hanelt et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, these transitions are more frequent in the apo transporter, consistent with a lack of large energetic barriers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akyuz et al., 2013</a>). In Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, the compact translocation-competent apo conformation of the transport domain is stabilized by interactions between the collapsed HP2, and HP1, TM7, and TM8. In EAATs, by contrast, we speculate that these interactions are insufficient and that K<sup>+</sup> binding to the Ct site is required to stabilize the translocation-competent closed conformation that can return to the outside, ensuring coupling between substrate uptake and counter-transport of K<sup>+</sup> ion.

For crystallization, the protein samples at 2.75 mg/ml were supplemented with 20\u201350 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.2 to 0.5 mM of a mixture of <i>E. coli</i> polar lipid extract and egg PC (3:1 wt:wt) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) and incubated on ice for 45 min. Crystallization was carried out using hanging drop diffusion methods in 96-well plates at 4\u00b0C. Initial crystallization conditions were identified using a replica of the crystallization screen MemGold (Molecular Dimensions., Altamonte Springs, FL), in which Na<sup>+</sup>-containing compounds were replaced with K<sup>+</sup>-containing compounds. The screen was prepared using the liquid handler Formulator (Formulatrix, Inc., Waltham, MA). Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup> crystals were grown in 14\u201320% PEG 400, and 0.1 M potassium citrate, pH 5.0 to 6.0. For Tl<sup>+</sup> soaking, crystals were washed in 20% PEG 400, 20 mM MES/Tris, pH 6.5, 20 mM KNO<sub>3,</sub> 20 mM MgNO<sub>3</sub>, and 10 mM <i>n</i>-decyl-\u03b1-D-maltopyranoside, and then incubated in 20% PEG 400, 20 mM MES/Tris, pH 6.5, 5 mM MgNO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM <i>n</i>-decyl-\u03b1-D-maltopyranoside, and 150 mM TlNO<sub>3</sub>. In ion competition experiments, the soaking solution was further supplemented with either NaNO<sub>3</sub> or KNO<sub>3</sub>. To obtain an alkali-free structure, crystals were soaked in solution containing 20% PEG 400, 20 mM MES/Tris, pH 6.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM <i>n</i>-decyl-\u03b1-D-maltopyranoside. Crystals were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen."

Data from crystals soaked in Tl<sup>+</sup> were collected at a wavelength of 0.97 \u00c5. Data were processed using HKL2000 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Otwinowski and Minor, 1997</a>), and further analyzed using the CCP4 program suite (<a href=\"#bib5\">Collaborative Computational Project, 1994</a>). Anisotropy correction was performed as described previously (<a href=\"#bib43\">Strong et al., 2006</a>). Briefly, resolution limits along the <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> axes were determined using the UCLA\u2013MBI Diffraction Anisotropy server (<a href=\"http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/anisoscale/\">http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/anisoscale/</a>) and applied as cutoffs to truncate the dataset obtained after processing of diffraction images. After scaling in HKL2000, structure factors were anisotropically scaled using PHASER (<a href=\"#bib32\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>), and a negative B factor correction was applied to these structure factors using CAD. Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement with PHASER (<a href=\"#bib32\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>), using the structure of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> either in the outward-facing state (PDB code 2NWX) or the inward-facing state (PDB code 3KBC) as the search model. Refinement was carried out by rounds of manual model building in COOT (<a href=\"#bib11\">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</a>) and refinement in REFMAC5 with TLS (<a href=\"#bib51\">Winn et al., 2001</a>). With the exception of the analysis of the data from alkali-free Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup> crystals, where protomers in the trimer were clearly not identical, the electron density maps and the anomalous difference Fourier maps were three or sixfold averaged in real space. Strict non-crystallographic symmetry constrains were also applied during structural refinement in REFMAC5 when necessary. Structures of the transport domain were superimposed and R.M.S.D.s calculated using VMD software (<a href=\"#bib24\">Humphrey et al., 1996</a>). All structural figures were prepared using Pymol (DeLano Scientific, LLC) (<a href=\"#bib10\">DeLano, 2008</a>)."

Fluorescence emissions were measured after at least 1000 s equilibration. The data were analyzed using SigmaPlot12 (Systat software, Inc., San Jose, CA). Fractional fluorescence changes were corrected and normalized with respect to the dilution factors and maximal fluorescence changes, respectively. Corrected fluorescence changes were plotted as a function of ligand concentration and fitted to the Hill equation. Sodium activity was calculated as \u03b3 \u00d7 [Na<sup>+</sup>], where \u03b3 is the activity coefficient.

The manuscript contains an array of important data, including substrate-free states, and sodium-only states, that together provide crucial insights into ion-substrate coupling and transporter conformational dynamics. The several crystal structures for ion-bound apo state allow for the first time a dissection of the exact mechanism of coupling in this system. The findings are in line with previous work and the proposed mechanisms of translocation of the apo states and the Na coupling makes perfect sense. The discussion on a tentative location of K+ binding site, while offering a plausible explanation (and a novel one) remains a little speculative. However, the authors are careful in the interpretation of the K sites and these sites might be the ones used in EAATs. Nevertheless, this is novel and rigorous study of a high caliber! One of the reviewers describes the paper as \u201ca great manuscript\u201d."
