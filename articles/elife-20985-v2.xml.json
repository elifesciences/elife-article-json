Here, we report that decreasing the function of CCR5 increases MAPK/CREB signaling, long-term potentiation (LTP), and hippocampus-dependent memory in mice, while neuronal CCR5 overexpression caused memory deficits. Decreasing CCR5 function in mouse barrel cortex also resulted in enhanced spike timing dependent plasticity and consequently, dramatically accelerated experience-dependent plasticity. These results suggest that CCR5 is a powerful suppressor for plasticity and memory, and CCR5 over-activation by viral proteins may contribute to HIV-associated cognitive deficits. Consistent with this hypothesis, the HIV V3 peptide caused LTP, signaling and memory deficits that were prevented by Ccr5 knockout or knockdown. Overall, our results demonstrate that CCR5 plays an important role in neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and indicate that CCR5 has a role in the cognitive deficits caused by HIV."

                    "text": "Although the role of CCR5 in immunity and in HIV infection has been studied widely, its role in neuronal plasticity, learning and memory is not understood. Here, we report that decreasing the function of CCR5 increases MAPK/CREB signaling, long-term potentiation (LTP), and hippocampus-dependent memory in mice, while neuronal CCR5 overexpression caused memory deficits. Decreasing CCR5 function in mouse barrel cortex also resulted in enhanced spike timing dependent plasticity and consequently, dramatically accelerated experience-dependent plasticity. These results suggest that CCR5 is a powerful suppressor for plasticity and memory, and CCR5 over-activation by viral proteins may contribute to HIV-associated cognitive deficits. Consistent with this hypothesis, the HIV V3 peptide caused LTP, signaling and memory deficits that were prevented by Ccr5 knockout or knockdown. Overall, our results demonstrate that CCR5 plays an important role in neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and indicate that CCR5 has a role in the cognitive deficits caused by HIV."

Thus, our studies reveal an important suppressor role for CCR5 in neuroplasticity, learning and memory, independent of the proposed roles of CCR5 in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Since our results and other studies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cormier and Dragic, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Morikis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shen et al., 2000</a>) show that HIV coat proteins can bind and activate CCR5, thus activating its memory suppressor functions, our results suggest that besides the neuroinflammation induced neurodegeneration that can cause HIV-associated cognitive deficits, CCR5 activation by HIV coat proteins also contributes to the cognitive deficits caused by HIV."

In total, 148 transgenic and knockout mutant mouse strains with controlled genetic backgrounds were chosen at random from the inventories of commercial vendors (Jackson Laboratories and Taconic Farms) as well as individual laboratories, and screened for contextual memory phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Interestingly, 6 out of the 8 chemokine or chemokine receptor mutant strains screened (# labeling, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) showed positive Z scores (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), including three mutant strains with scores above 1, suggesting enhanced memory for contextual conditioning. HRas<sup>G12V</sup> mice were used for comparison, since they were previously reported (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kushner et al., 2005</a>) to show enhanced memory for contextual fear conditioning. Like HRas<sup>G12V</sup> mice, mice homozygous for a null-mutation of the <i>Ccr5</i> gene (<i>Ccr5<sup>-/-</sup></i>) showed average Z scores above 1. The <i>CCR5</i> knockout resulted in memory enhancements for contextual conditioning when tested 24 hr after training (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>,\u00a0t<sub>(14)</sub> = 2.43 p&lt;0.05, Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test) and 2-weeks after training (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>,\u00a0t<sub>(14)</sub> = 3.07 p&lt;0.01, Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test). These results show that the <i>Ccr5</i> knockout results in enhanced long-term (24 hr) and remote (2-weeks) memory. Importantly, activity levels including baseline activity and activity bursts during shock-exposure were normal (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>), a result demonstrating that the enhanced freezing of <i>Ccr5<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice is not due to either decreases in activity or increased sensitivity to the unconditioning stimulus (i.e., the footshock). In contrast to contextual conditioning, tone conditioning (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hall et al., 2001</a>) was unaltered in the <i>Ccr5<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>), confirming that the contextual conditioning enhancement of these mutants is not due to non-specific behavioral changes that alter conditioning responses."

In the hidden-platform version of the Morris water maze, mice were tested for their ability to use spatial cues around a pool to find an escape platform hidden just beneath the water surface. Following 2-days of training, memory was assessed by a probe test wherein the mice search for 60 s with the platform removed from the pool. Since this probe test was administered early in training, the WT mice did not search selectively for the platform. In contrast, even with this limited amount of training, <i>Ccr5<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice spent significantly more time in the quadrant where the platform had been during training (target quadrant) than the other three quadrants, demonstrating that the <i>Ccr5<sup>+/-</sup></i> mutation not only enhances learning and memory for contextual conditioning, but also results in enhanced spatial learning and memory [<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; Two-way ANOVA with repeated measure, overall (genotype \u00d7 percentage of time in each quadrant) interaction: F<sub>(3</sub>,<sub>84)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.81; Main effect of quadrant%: F<sub>(3,84)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a06.99.

Specifically, we utilized the paradigm used for our knockout studies where a probe test was given after 2 days training, when most control mice (transfected with shRNA-Cont virus) still failed to learn the task (e.g., spent similar times in all four quadrants of the maze). Strikingly, mice transfected with the shRNA-CCR5 virus spent significantly more time in the target quadrant than the other three quadrants [<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; Two-way ANOVA with repeated measure, overall (virus \u00d7 percentage of time in each quadrant) interaction: F<sub>(3</sub>,<sub>120)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a04.18; Main effect of quadrant%: F<sub>(3</sub>,<sub>120)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a09.45.

Trimming all of whiskers except for D1 produces both an increase in the responses of layer 2/3 (L2/3) cells located in deprived barrel-columns to stimulation of the spared D1 whisker, and an increase in the size of the spared whisker\u2019s representation in the barrel cortex (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fox, 1992</a>). Experience-dependent plasticity was assayed by measuring the single unit spike responses to the spared D1 whisker of single L2/3 neurons located in the deprived barrels surrounding the D1 barrel (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Although 7-days of single whisker experience is insufficient to produce experience-dependent potentiation in WT barrel cortex (<a href=\"#bib22\">Glazewski and Fox, 1996</a>), three measures indicated faster potentiation in <i>Ccr5<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice.

Third, a plot of D1 response versus principal whisker (PW) response showed points above the identity line (D1&gt;PW) only for <i>Ccr5<sup>+/-</sup></i> but not WT mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Comparison of the time course of vibrissae dominance also showed a significant increase in WVDI in <i>Ccr5</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice (0.396\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.051), but not in WT mice (0.111\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.011) after 7 days deprivation [<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>; Interaction: F<sub>(2,41)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.398, genotype, F<sub>(1,41)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a08.919, days deprived F<sub>(2,41)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a010.20, genotype and deprivation period are significant: t\u00a0=\u00a03.05, p&lt;0.05, Bonferroni post-tests].

Similarly, multiple doses of gp120 in rats also resulted in physiological and cognitive deficits (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tang et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, our study shows that acute treatment (one injection 30 min before training) of HIV gp120 V3 loop peptide, which is known to bind and activate CCR5 in the brain (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Shah et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sirois et al., 2005</a>), was sufficient to induce deficits in a key cellular mechanism for learning and memory (LTP) and also in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in WT mice. Remarkably, these deficits were prevented by either a viral-mediated <i>Ccr5</i>-knockdown or by a <i>Ccr5</i> knockout mutation. The V3 loop is important for HIV binding to CCR5 or CXCR4, and LTP deficits caused by the V3 loop peptide had been reported to be blocked by a CXCR4 antagonist (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dong and Xiong, 2006</a>). Nevertheless, our results show that both in the barrel cortex and in hippocampus, the LTP deficits caused by the V3 peptide are prevented by the homozygous <i>Ccr5</i> mutation, demonstrating that CCR5 plays a critical role in the V3-induced deficits in neuroplasticity. CCR5 antagonists and inhibitors have shown efficacy in reduction of viral load in clinical studies (<a href=\"#bib18\">F\u00e4tkenheuer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gulick et al., 2008</a>).

Yfp<sup>+</sup>/<i>Ccr</i>5<sup>+/-</sup> mice were generated by breeding male Thy1-YFP mice with female <i>Ccr</i>5<sup>+/-</sup> mice, and 3 to 6 months old Yfp<sup>+</sup>/<i>Ccr</i>5<sup>+/-</sup> mice and their littermates Yfp<sup>+</sup>/<i>Ccr</i>5<sup>+/+</sup> (Yfp<sup>+</sup>/WT) mice were used for the spine density experiment. 10-week-old male C57BL/6N mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) for shRNA-cont or shRNA-CCR5 AAV injections and for the V3 loop peptide experiments. Mice were group housed with free access to food and water, and maintained on a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle. All experiments were performed during the light phase of the cycle. All studies were approved by the Animal Research Committee at UCLA and University of Cardiff and carried out in compliance with the United Kingdom\u2019s Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 where applicable."

Two weeks after training, the mice were first returned to chambers (context B) which were different from the training chambers (context A) for the cued memory test (tone test), and 90 min later mice were returned to the training chamber for a 5 min test to assess contextual memory. Standard Z scores were used to present the results of the memory screen, which combine both freezing and suppression of activity ratios (SR) scores from the same mice. Suppression of activity ratios (SR) were calculated as SR=(test activity)/(test activity + baseline activity). Z scores for the entire wild type population were calculated as Z score=(individual-population mean)/standard deviation, and the expected value is a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Z scores for each mutant were calculated as: Z score= average[(%Freezing individual\u2013%Freezing population mean)/(standard deviation of population), (\u22121)*(SR individual\u2013SR population mean)/(standard deviation of the population)]. So Z scores reflect alterations in both freezing and activity suppression caused by different genetic mutations, with simplified comparisons and improved reliability (<a href=\"#bib40\">Matynia et al., 2008</a>)."

The use of overexpression and loss of function of Ccr5 was considered to be appropriate and supportive of the conclusions. It was suggested by the second reviewer that how Ccr5 has effects on excitatory synapses and upon pMAPK and pCREB levels be further considered.

Traditionally, CCR5 has been studied as a chemokine receptor that mediates HIV cellular entry, and cognitive deficits in HIV infected individuals have been considered as a byproduct of neuroinflammation. In the present study, Zhou et al. use both loss-of-function (haploinsufficiency of Ccr5 heterozygote mice, shRNA mediated knockdown of Ccr5) and gain-of-function (Ccr5 overexpressing transgenic mice) approaches to show that CCR5 acts as a suppressor of neuroplasticity and memory, and that transgenic overexpression of CCR5 causes deficits in hippocampus-dependent contextual memory and neocortical experience-dependent plasticity. The authors further show that a single injection of HIV coat peptide that forms the ligand for CCR5 is sufficient to cause acute memory deficits that are prevented in Ccr5 null mice."

Zhou and colleagues report here that they have identified in a reverse genetic memory screen that hetero- and homozygotic KO mice lacking the GPCR Ccr5 exhibit enhanced memory in multiple memory tasks that involve the hippocampus, as shown here for fear conditioning and the Morris water maze. These behavioral changes are correlated with increased MAPK and CREB signaling following training as well as enhanced hippocampal LTP. In agreement with the hetero- and homozygotic KO data, Ccr5 knockdown in the adult hippocampus results in enhanced memory. Overexpression experiments support that Ccr5 acts in neurons to restrict memory processes. Complementary changes are observed in the barrel cortex, where Ccr5+/- mice or mice in which Ccr5 was knocked-down in neurons show enhanced responses to stimulation of a spared whisker, indicating increased experience-dependent plasticity. Recordings from pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 of the barrel cortex support enhanced LTP in these mice. Other physiological changes include lower release probability and smaller, less frequent mEPSPs in KO mice. Previous findings had shown that HIV coat proteins can bind and activate human CCR5, concomitant with the impaired cognition that can occur in HIV patients. The authors therefore tested acute effects of the gp120 V3 loop peptide on synaptic plasticity and memory processes in mice. They found that loss of Ccr5 or reduction of Ccr5 in hippocampal neurons protects against V3 peptide-induced LTP deficits and memory impairments. This is in agreement with a previous publication by Maung et al. (2014) that reports protection of Ccr5 KO mice against effects of a gp120 peptide. The results extend those findings by determining the timeline of peptide effects and by showing that Ccr5 acts in hippocampal neurons to mediate these effects."

Ligand binding to CCR5 modulates p44/42 MAPK signaling (Paruch et al., 2007; Tyner et al., 2005), and p44/42 MAPK can also regulate CCR5 expression (Li et al., 2009). Besides MAPK, CCR5 expression is also modulated by CREB signaling (Kuipers et al., 2008; Wierda and van den Elsen, 2012). Although we did not investigate directly this point in our manuscript, previous results suggest that CCR5 impacts CREB signaling through G\u03b1i pathway and its downstream cAMP and PKA signaling pathways (Delghandi et al., 2005)."

There is an extensive literature demonstrating that to determine the effects of a mutation independently from other effects caused by genetic differences between mutants and controls, it is important that the mutant mice and their controls are in the same genetic background. For example, the hybrid mice used as controls in the Lee et al. study out-perform inbred mice, such as the B6J strain (genetic background of the <i>Ccr5</i><sup>-/-</sup> mutants in the Lee et al. study), in learning tasks. We also found that in a fear conditioning task, B6/129 hybrid mice given very weak training (one 0.5mA shock) showed similar memory levels (Wiltgen and Silva, 2007) as the C57BL/6NTac mice in our study that received very strong training (3x0.75mA shocks) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a> in our current study). In contrast to the Lee et al. study, we used wild type (WT) littermates as controls for the <i>Ccr5</i><sup>-/-</sup> and <i>Ccr5</i><sup>+/-</sup> mutant mice we studied. In our study, both WT controls and <i>Ccr5</i> mice are in the same C57BL/6NTac background. 2) Additionally, Lee et al. used aged mice (12-18 month old) in their study, while we used adult mice (3-5 months old) for our experiments. Cell surface expression of CCR5 has been reported to change with age (Abraham et al., 2008), which may change the role of CCR5 in learning and memory during aging. We have modified our comment in the Discussion section as following \"Although a previous study (Lee et al., 2009) reported learning and memory deficits in aged CCR5 mutants, this study used aged mice (12-18 month old) and the control mice with a different genetic background\"."
