It is thought that maneuverability may be influenced by intrinsic body mass and wing morphology, and by physiological muscle capacity, but this hypothesis has not yet been evaluated because it requires tracking a large number of free flight maneuvers from known individuals. We used an automated tracking system to record flight sequences from 20 Anna's hummingbirds flying solo and in competition in a large chamber. We found that burst muscle capacity predicted most performance metrics. Hummingbirds with higher burst capacity flew with faster velocities, accelerations, and rotations, and they used more demanding complex turns. In contrast, body mass did not predict variation in maneuvering performance, and wing morphology predicted only the use of arcing turns and high centripetal accelerations. Collectively, our results indicate that burst muscle capacity is a key predictor of maneuverability."

It is thought that maneuverability may be influenced by intrinsic body mass and wing morphology, and by physiological muscle capacity, but this hypothesis has not yet been evaluated because it requires tracking a large number of free flight maneuvers from known individuals. We used an automated tracking system to record flight sequences from 20 Anna's hummingbirds flying solo and in competition in a large chamber. We found that burst muscle capacity predicted most performance metrics. Hummingbirds with higher burst capacity flew with faster velocities, accelerations, and rotations, and they used more demanding complex turns. In contrast, body mass did not predict variation in maneuvering performance, and wing morphology predicted only the use of arcing turns and high centripetal accelerations. Collectively, our results indicate that burst muscle capacity is a key predictor of maneuverability."

This revealed that body size did not affect how well the birds could maneuver. Instead, the muscle capacity of the birds \u2013 their ability to generate force rapidly \u2013 determined how well the birds performed most types of movement. Birds with higher muscle capacity flew faster, had faster accelerations and decelerations, could rotate their bodies more quickly, and performed more demanding and complex turns."

Most biomechanical research on birds has focused on either brief (e.g., take off) or steady state movements (e.g., forward flight) that can be studied most readily in the laboratory. Maneuverability is therefore one of the most important but least understood aspects of animal locomotion. Warrick and coworkers (<a href=\"#bib49\">Warrick et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Warrick and Dial, 1998</a>) proposed that there are both intrinsic and facultative influences on maneuvering performance. For animals that perform powered flight, intrinsic maneuverability is defined by the physical limitations imposed by morphology (<a href=\"#bib31\">Norberg and Rayner, 1987</a>), but excess muscle capacity should allow them to facultatively overcome the costs of suboptimal morphology, achieving higher levels of performance by sacrificing efficiency. Although compelling, this hypothesis has never been tested explicitly."

Because these previous studies focused on species and gender comparisons, less is known about how individual variation in wing morphology influences performance, especially with respect to maneuverability. One complication is that different wing sizes and shapes can be favored depending on the specific maneuver performed, e.g., yaw versus banked turns. Given the diversity of flight behaviors, it is unclear if the requirements for maneuvering exert strong selection on wing morphology."

Aerodynamic force can be directed for performing maneuvers that require greater output than the minimum requirements for flight. Excess muscle capacity can also be used to compensate for anatomical or spatial constraints on wing movement (<a href=\"#bib50\">Warrick, 1998</a>). Muscle output of hummingbirds has been quantified in several ways including oxygen consumption to determine metabolic input, wingbeat kinematics to estimate mechanical power output, and electromyography (EMG) to measure myoelectric input. Considering hovering flight as the point of comparison, forward flight at the fastest speeds recorded in a wind tunnel requires about 20% more metabolic (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clark and Dudley, 2010</a>) and myoelectric input (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tobalske et al., 2010</a>). Maximum sustained hovering performance has been studied by experimentally lowering air density to the lowest values in which birds are still able to hover. These experiments revealed that hovering in hypodense air requires ~40% higher mechanical power output (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chai and Dudley, 1995</a>) and ~60% higher spatial recruitment of muscle fibers, as measured by the spike amplitude of the electromyogram recordings (<a href=\"#bib5\">Altshuler et al., 2010b</a>), in comparison to hovering in normal air. By far the most expensive flight behavior studied to date in hummingbirds is maximum load lifting, which requires 200\u2013400% more mechanical power output (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chai et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chai and Millard, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Altshuler et al., 2010a</a>), about 200% more spatial recruitment (EMG spike amplitude), and 150% more temporal recruitment (EMG spike frequency) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Altshuler et al., 2010b</a>) compared to hovering."

Thus, it is not surprising that this assay provides the maximum muscle capacity that has been measured in hummingbirds. It is particularly useful for quantifying variation among and within species in burst muscle capacity. Studies using the load lifting assay have revealed that maximum burst muscle capacity is related to hummingbird evolutionary ecology. Altshuler and coworkers (<a href=\"#bib4\">Altshuler et al., 2004b</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Altshuler, 2006</a>) demonstrated that ecological role is more strongly related to load lifting ability than morphological parameters such as wing loading. Load lifting ability is also associated with species- and gender-specific competitive ability at different elevations. Altshuler (<a href=\"#bib6\">Altshuler, 2006</a>) suggested that the relationship between maximum muscle capacity and competitive ability may be mediated through maneuvering performance."

Although field studies are valuable for quantifying average species performance, individual identification and large sample sizes are required to examine sources of within-species variation. Here, we studied the free-flight maneuvering performance of Anna's hummingbirds (<i>Calypte anna</i>) in a large flight chamber (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Flight maneuvers in a chamber are not expected to be the same as outdoors, and may have lower velocities and accelerations. The benefit of this approach is that a large number of measurements from the same individuals can be combined with other data to examine how variation in the observed maneuvers is influenced by individual morphology and muscle capacity."

Flight trajectories were parsed into a set of performance metrics based on body position and orientation. The first goal of our study was to determine if voluntary maneuvering performance is repeatable within individuals. Repeatability of maneuvering performance can arise either through a strong influence of fixed traits such as morphology and anatomy, or through other consistent influences, such as motivation. We expect that repeatable measurements will be most useful for our second goal, determining how variation in maneuverability among individuals is influenced by natural variation in morphology and muscle capacity. This also required measuring morphological traits and maximum burst performance for each individual. Our third goal was to determine how motivation state induced by the presence of a competitor influenced maneuvering performance. To address this question we compared flight trials with and without competitors."

The velocities and accelerations were split into vertical and horizontal components. The body orientation vector was represented in spherical coordinates as azimuth and pitch angles. We took the first derivatives to obtain azimuth and pitch velocities. Because the video tracking system did not allow a measurement of body roll, we decided to use a global coordinate system instead of a body axis-centered coordinate system. In our frame of reference, pitch is a global measure defined relative to the horizontal plane. Heading was calculated as the instantaneous direction of the horizontal translation velocity, and the heading velocity was calculated as the derivative of heading."

In contrast to translational maneuvers, which were defined by the maxima and the minima of the velocities, the rotational maneuvers begin and end with changes in rotational velocity direction. Thus, the performance metrics calculated from these rotational maneuvers were the average rotational velocities over the whole maneuver instead of maximum accelerations or decelerations. An additional constraint common to all three rotational maneuvers is that the linear distance traveled was less than 10 cm. We chose 10 cm as a general cutoff here and elsewhere because this value is close to the body length of a bird and the wing span at mid-downstroke, thus providing a good threshold for distinguishing translational motion."

From these maneuvers we calculated either the average pitch-up (<i>PitchU</i><sub>vel, avg</sub>) or pitch-down (<i>PitchD</i><sub>vel, avg</sub>) velocity as performance metrics. Defining yaw turns is challenging because hummingbirds fly with an upright body posture. When the body posture is near vertical, azimuthal rotation is implemented by rolling about the body axis, but when the body posture is near horizontal, azimuthal rotation is implemented by yawing the body axis. We therefore define yaw turns as azimuthal changes in direction when the body pitch angle is below 75\u00b0. An additional constraint specific to yaw turns was a requirement for at least 90\u00b0 change in azimuth.

Arcing turn maneuvers were defined as sequences with a heading velocity &gt; 90\u00b0/sec, a minimum total translational velocity &gt; 0.5\u2009m/s, a total distance traveled &gt; 25 cm, and a vertical distance traveled &lt; 10 cm. These search parameters reliably extract arcing turns that occur in the horizontal plane. To compare arcing turns of different shapes and scales we clipped the trajectories to a length of 25 cm centered at the sharpest point of the turn. From the clipped trajectory we analyzed three performance metrics, average velocity (<i>Arc</i><sub>vel, avg</sub>), radius (<i>Arc</i><sub>rad</sub>), and the maximum centripetal acceleration (<i>Arc</i><sub>cent, max</sub>). The latter two were calculated using the following equations:"

These maneuvers were identified by searching for sequences of deceleration followed by acceleration with a maximum pitch &gt; 75\u00b0. Just as we did for the yaw turns, we assume that above a pitch angle of 75\u00b0, the rotation is primarily dominated by a body axis roll, even if there may be a slight yawing component. For this reason, we maintain the established 'pitch-roll' terminology to describe these types of turns. These sequences were clipped to a linear distance of 25 cm centered on the point of the lowest translational velocity. Only clipped sequences in which the total vertical displacement was less than 10 cm were analyzed. The performance metrics for pitch-roll turns were the time taken (<i>PRT</i><sub>time</sub>) and the degrees turned (<i>PRT</i><sub>deg</sub>)."

One metric, pitch-down velocity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>), did increase during competition as predicted (0.06 rev/s difference on average). We had no prediction for how competition would influence the relative use of pitch-roll and arcing turns, but found that birds used proportionately more arcing turns in the presence of a competitor (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>).

Other studies have measured elements of maneuvering performance of hummingbirds in the field (<a href=\"#bib14\">Clark, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sholtis et al., 2015</a>) and documented the maximum velocities, accelerations, and rotations obtained during specific maneuvers. Our values for velocity and acceleration are considerably lower than either of the field studies, likely because of cage size. However, the benefit of using a flight chamber is that it allowed us to evaluate the relative contributions of different factors to the performance we observed. We found that hummingbirds maneuvered with highly repeatable performance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Maximum weight lifted during load lifting trials predicted most of the performance metrics that we measured, independent of a bird\u2019s wing size and shape, such that birds with higher burst muscle capacity flew faster, had higher horizontal accelerations, faster rotations, and higher performance during complex turns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Aspect ratio predicted only two performance metrics, such that birds with higher aspect ratio wings performed turns with higher centripetal acceleration and a greater percentage of arcing turns (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). When flying in the presence of a competitor, hummingbirds used faster pitch velocities, although they used slower horizontal accelerations and decelerations. During competition trials birds also increased the proportion of arcing turns used (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Collectively, these results suggest that burst muscle capacity is a much more important predictor of flight maneuverability than within-species variation in body mass, wing morphology, and competition with conspecifics."

Wing morphology has well-known physical affects on flight performance: aspect ratio predicts aerodynamic efficiency, wing area is directly proportional to aerodynamic force, and wing length is a strong predictor of wingbeat frequency. All of these morphological traits, along with body mass, could affect maneuverability in flight, either individually or in combination. For example, wing loading (the ratio of body mass to wing area or to area swept by the wings) was initially thought to be a key predictor of hummingbird flight performance and behavioral ecology (<a href=\"#bib19\">Feinsinger and Chaplin, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Feinsinger, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Feinsinger and Colwell, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Feinsinger et al., 1979</a>). However, in our analysis the hypothesis that wing size and body mass together determine maneuvering performance was not supported for any performance metric (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). We found it especially surprising that only wing shape (and not wing size) predicted maneuvering performance. It is possible that other morphological traits may determine maneuvering performance, or that subtle relationships may have gone undetected, because our analysis was limited to 20 individuals of a single species. It would be informative to expand this analysis to other species with potentially greater within-species variation in wing morphology, and to assess maneuverability across different hummingbird species with divergent morphologies."

However, aspect ratio was the only morphological parameter that predicted performance, and only for a limited set of maneuvers. Aspect ratio is a key determinant in wing efficiency for fixed wings, such as during gliding (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pennycuick, 1983</a>), and it has recently been demonstrated that higher aspect ratio wings correspond to higher power factors in the revolving wings of hummingbirds (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kruyt et al., 2014</a>). We found that aspect ratio had a strong effect on the few performance metrics that it predicted, but did not affect most features of maneuvering performance. This suggests a limited role for aerodynamic efficiency in many features of maneuvering."

Load lifting is measured as a transient escape maneuver that is likely anaerobic and performed inefficiently. All hummingbirds reach maximum load lifting performance at a geometric limit set by the amplitude of the wings: wing stroke amplitude cannot extend much past 180\u00b0 without the two wings interfering with each other physically and aerodynamically (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chai and Dudley, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chai et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chai and Millard, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Altshuler and Dudley, 2003</a>). Maximum load lifting also elicits a substantial increase in wingbeat frequency as a constant fraction of baseline wingbeat frequency (<a href=\"#bib3\">Altshuler and Dudley, 2003</a>). Thus, maximum load lifting performance involves brief increases in muscle strain and muscle velocity to physically imposed limits. The capacity to increase muscle strain and velocity has previously been shown to influence foraging behavior and competitive ability (<a href=\"#bib6\">Altshuler, 2006</a>). The results of the current study demonstrate that it also underlies multiple features of maneuvering performance."

Moreover, vertical performance was not well predicted by morphology, burst capacity, or competitor presence in this study. The dimensions of our experimental chamber likely influenced our observations of vertical performance. Hummingbirds in captivity tend to fly near the top of their cages, and the vertical dimension of the chamber (1.5\u2009m) may have limited vertical movement."

The most territorial species will vigorously defend territories (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carpenter et al., 1983</a>) and lekking sites (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rico-Guevara and Araya-Salas, 2015</a>). In staged competition studies, paired hummingbirds will also establish and defend territories (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tiebout, 1993</a>). We originally intended to use competition to elicit high levels of flight activity and maneuvering performance in territorial male Anna's hummingbirds (<a href=\"#bib40\">Stiles, 1982</a>). However, we found that competitor presence affected only a small number of the maneuvering performance metrics that we measured. Pitch-down velocity increased with competition whereas horizontal acceleration and deceleration actually decreased. We do not know why these three metrics (in addition to <i>PRT%</i>; see below) were strongly affected by competition or why they were affected in the directions observed. However, there are several possible causes for why competitor presence did not affect the other metrics: 1) we were unable to elicit a high level of competition or territoriality; 2) the birds may have worked out dominance without the aggressive interactions normally seen outdoors; and/or 3) the interactions required to establish dominance may have been very brief (<a href=\"#bib38\">Maynard Smith, 1974</a>) such that they comprised only a minuscule sample of the maneuvers we analyzed. This experiment was not designed to study the effects of maneuvering performance on competitive success, although this represents an important topic for future investigation. Laboratory performance tests do not always reflect field behavior (<a href=\"#bib25\">Irschick, 2003</a>) and outdoor studies of maneuvering performance will be important for understanding the role of maneuverability in competitive interactions. Recent advances in video tracking (<a href=\"#bib43\">Theriault et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Shelton et al., 2014</a>) should make it possible to track individuals for multiple measurements."

The minimum radius of an arcing turn is limited by the maximum centripetal acceleration that a bird can generate while maintaining lift. The speed of a pitch-roll turn is limited by the ability to decelerate and then accelerate. Birds with higher wing aspect ratio may have preferred arcing turns because they were able to generate higher centripetal accelerations. Birds with higher burst muscle capacity may have favored pitch-roll turns because they had higher accelerating and decelerating performance. These observations suggest the hypothesis that high aspect ratio and high burst capacity enhance maneuverability.

Using this method, we identify several performance metrics that were highly repeatable across trials for individual hummingbirds, strongly correlated with individual morphological and physiological characteristics, and largely uninfluenced by the added motivation of a conspecific competitor. This approach to measuring maneuverability will be useful for future studies comparing maneuvering performance across different experimental manipulations, geographic ranges, or ecological, morphological, and phylogenetic groups."

We therefore selected wing length as the more robust measure of wing size, because unlike area, wing length is less prone to measurement error as a result of variation in feather overlap when wings are positioned for measurements. We verified that our results were consistent when using wing area instead of length, and thus these two traits should be considered interchangeable as measures of wing size in this study. Because both wing morphology and muscle capacity may influence burst performance, we used burst performance controlled statistically for wing morphology as a measure of burst muscle capacity.

Body orientation was estimated using an algorithm that fit orientations to the body axis in each 2D image. Each sequence of five consecutive images cropped around the bird was aligned at the optical center of intensity. Averaging these images effectively eliminated the wings and emphasized the body. Orientation was estimated by calculating the covariance matrix of the image luminance and then computing the eigensystem of this covariance matrix. The eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue was taken as the orientation. Orientation vector assignments were also smoothed with a Kalman filter using more restrictive smoothing parameters than were used to smooth body position. To determine appropriate smoothing parameters we replotted the smoothed body orientation vectors onto a sample of videos, and visually chose the ones that provided the best fit.

This influence of smoothing parameters is a well known limitation of video tracking (<a href=\"#bib47\">Walker, 1998</a>). Thus, although acceleration values are comparable within a study, caution must be applied when comparing the magnitude of acceleration values among studies differing in camera frame rate, filming volume, calibrations, and smoothing parameters (<a href=\"#bib47\">Walker, 1998</a>). For our final performance metrics we used instantaneous body orientation and orientation velocity, but not orientation acceleration."

An object began when the tracking system detected new movement and ended when either the object stopped moving, the error in the 3D reprojection grew too large, or multiple objects came within 2 cm of each other. In our experiments tracking hummingbird flight led to two problems in determining distinct objects. The first is that very stable hovering can be misidentified as perching. For example, as a bird went into an extended hovering bout, such as at a feeder, the tracking system detected the cessation of movement and ended the trajectory. Conversely, when the bird perched at the end of a flight or in between two flights, especially if it continued to move its head or fluff its feathers, the tracking system treated the bird as moving and continued the trajectory. Because our study focused on identifying and analyzing relatively long, moving trajectories, these types of errors did not cause problems. The second challenge concerned identification of birds during close encounters in competition trials. When two tracked objects became close to each other, even if they did not physically touch, the tracking system could not accurately distinguish them. We used a conservative solution and terminated the trajectories whenever two birds came close enough that the tracked objects merged. Birds were later identified manually by a team of digitizers who viewed the videos and assigned each object number to either the marked or unmarked bird."

We estimated repeatability for each performance metric from an intercept-only mixed effects model that included estimates of the population intercept (i.e., the grand mean) as well as an individual intercept for each bird (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nakagawa and Schielzeth, 2010</a>). Such a model has two variance components, the variance of the random intercept values (variance among individuals) and a residual variance associated with the error term. Repeatability is the variance among individuals divided by the total variance (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nakagawa and Schielzeth, 2010</a>). We used parametric bootstrapping with 5000 iterations to obtain confidence intervals for these repeatability estimates via the bootMer function in the lme4 (v1.1.7) package."

Unlike dichotomous null hypothesis testing, this approach quantifies support for multiple hypotheses, and it avoids the problem of eliminating potentially important predictors when two or more alternative models are equally well supported. The output for interpretation includes the effect size and relative importance of each predictor, and there are no null hypotheses or P values associated with this approach. As a measure of effect size we report the standardized partial regression coefficient, std \u03b2, for each predictor, which can be used to compare their independent associations with a given response variable.

The mass of weights lifted during load lifting was not significantly associated with wing length in our sample of 20 individuals (p = 0.87), however, it was negatively associated with wing aspect ratio (p = 0.04) controlling for site. Thus in our model analyses we used residual burst performance controlling for wing aspect ratio and site as a measure of burst muscle capacity independent of a bird\u2019s wing morphology."

The second issue was that one of the metrics, the heading change in pitch-roll turns (<i>PRT</i><sub>deg</sub>), had three values that were significant outliers (Grubb\u2019s test, all G &gt; 3.09, all p&lt;0.03; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We determined that these three statistical outliers were not errors in the tracking system but were instead derived from one individual that used pitch-roll turns to make small heading changes, unlike the other birds. We omitted these outliers from the analysis of heading change in pitch-roll turns to ensure that all fitted Gaussian models met the required assumptions, with no other outliers or problems of skew or heteroskedasticity. The best-fit model for heading change in pitch-roll turns was the intercept-only model regardless of whether the outliers were included."

Azimuth is a global coordinate reference; pitch and yaw are traditionally body coordinate. Body axis orientation taken from the 2d ellipsoidal trace gives long axis (head/tail) in a local (body) coordinate space; we take it the other two orthogonal axes were assigned without anatomical reference (body lateral and body dorso-ventral). This reference would be required to determine body coordinate space definitions of pitch and yaw (and roll) \u2013 which are the traditional uses of the terms (yaw = rotation around a dorso-ventral body axis; pitch = rotation around lateral axis etc.). We suggest the authors make it clear (in the main text) that the \"pitch\" is therefore not necessarily rotation around the lateral axis (say glenoid to glenoid) of the body, but rather a global \"pitch\", with the lateral axis being global horizontal (i.e., orthogonal to gravity). Thus, making inferences regarding the anatomical mechanisms in play during these rotations is difficult; a hummingbird in a 90-degree bank to the left, but [body] yawing right will be producing a global \"pitch\".

Simultaneous effects \u2013 significantly negative coefficient for mass, positive for length, and negative for aspect ratio \u2013 would infer a wing loading effect, but might it get statistically buried? We think rooting these statistical hypotheses more firmly and clearly in Newtonian expectations would be wise. For example: the biggest effect seen for Acc centripetal max is wing shape. Yes, there may be unsteady effects here, but we know of no aerodynamic theory predicting how aspect ratio would strongly affect this performance variable, given how it was defined."

The double-correction seems most curious in the acceleration data since load lifting and accelerations are both dependent on force.
