Here, we demonstrate that mitophagy, which selectively removes damaged or unwanted mitochondria, regulated mitochondrial quality and quantity <i>in vivo</i>. Hypoxia induced extensive mitochondrial degradation in a FUNDC1-dependent manner in platelets, and this was blocked by <i>in vivo</i> administration of a cell-penetrating peptide encompassing the LIR motif of FUNDC1 only in wild-type mice. Genetic ablation of Fundc1 impaired mitochondrial quality and increased mitochondrial mass in platelets and rendered the platelets insensitive to hypoxia and the peptide. Moreover, hypoxic mitophagy in platelets protected the heart from worsening of I/R injury. This represents a new mechanism of the hypoxic preconditioning effect which reduces I/R injury. Our results demonstrate a critical role of mitophagy in mitochondrial quality control and platelet activation, and suggest that manipulation of mitophagy by hypoxia or pharmacological approaches may be a novel strategy for cardioprotection."

Here, we demonstrate that mitophagy, which selectively removes damaged or unwanted mitochondria, regulated mitochondrial quality and quantity <i>in vivo</i>. Hypoxia induced extensive mitochondrial degradation in a FUNDC1-dependent manner in platelets, and this was blocked by <i>in vivo</i> administration of a cell-penetrating peptide encompassing the LIR motif of FUNDC1 only in wild-type mice. Genetic ablation of Fundc1 impaired mitochondrial quality and increased mitochondrial mass in platelets and rendered the platelets insensitive to hypoxia and the peptide. Moreover, hypoxic mitophagy in platelets protected the heart from worsening of I/R injury. This represents a new mechanism of the hypoxic preconditioning effect which reduces I/R injury. Our results demonstrate a critical role of mitophagy in mitochondrial quality control and platelet activation, and suggest that manipulation of mitophagy by hypoxia or pharmacological approaches may be a novel strategy for cardioprotection."

                        "text": "Mitochondria are essential for many fundamental cellular processes, but their activities decline with age, and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria is associated with cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wallace, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn et al., 2013</a>). The crucial process of monitoring mitochondrial function and removing damaged or unwanted mitochondria is mainly achieved through mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rugarli and Langer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Escobar-Henriques and Langer, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hammerling and Gustafsson, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Okamoto, 2014</a>). Both ubiquitin- and receptor-mediated pathways mediate initiation of mitophagy (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lazarou et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Khaminets et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kirkin et al., 2009</a>). In response to various stresses, these pathways engage the core autophagy machinery, including ATG5, resulting in the\u00a0enclosure of damaged or unwanted mitochondria in autophagosomes followed by mitochondrial degradation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Itakura et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Joo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hara et al., 2006</a>). In addition to Parkin/PINK1 which mediates mitophagy in response to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and acute stresses (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lazarou et al., 2015</a>), several mitophagy receptors, including FUNDC1, localize at the outer mitochondrial membrane (<a href=\"#bib52\">Novak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zhang and Ney, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wu et al., 2014</a>). These receptors interact with LC3 (ATG8 in yeast) via a LIR (LC3-interacting region) motif to initiate mitophagy (<a href=\"#bib53\">Okamoto et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kanki and Klionsky, 2010</a>). Distinct mitophagy pathways may be activated through transcriptional or post-translational modifications in a stress- and cellular context-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib13\">Durcan and Fon, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wei et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Trausch-Azar et al., 2010</a>). PINK1 phosphorylates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin to trigger selective autophagy of unwanted and damaged mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lazarou et al., 2015</a>). In response to hypoxia, FUNDC1 is dephosphorylated, thus enhancing the FUNDC1/LC3 interaction (<a href=\"#bib42\">Liu et al., 2012</a>), while BNIP3 and NIX are transcriptionally upregulated (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kane et al., 2014</a>). Ablation of NIX impairs mitochondrial clearance during red blood cell differentiation, causing a failure of erythroid maturation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Regula et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Diwan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sandoval et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ney, 2015</a>). Mitochondrial distribution and morphology in Bnip3/Nix double knockout hearts were markedly perturbed (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dorn, 2010</a>), as BNIP3 and NIX may sense myocardial damage in cardiomyocytes and activate pro-apoptotic mediators (<a href=\"#bib69\">Youle and Strasser, 2008</a>). Parkin-mediated mitophagy is also important for adapting to acute stress (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kubli et al., 2013</a>) in the myocardium, although it may not be essential for normal turnover of cardiac mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kubli et al., 2013</a>). <i>Pink1</i><sup>\u2212</sup><i><sup>/</sup></i><sup>\u2212</sup> mice develop pathological cardiac hypertrophy (<a href=\"#bib69\">Youle and Strasser, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Billia et al., 2011</a>) accompanied by an\u00a0impaired mitochondrial function in cardiomyocytes. Although these studies highlight the importance of mitophagy mediators in development and stress responses, further evidence is needed to establish the causal link between defective autophagic mitochondrial clearance and physiological outcomes under normal and disease conditions."

Upon stimulation, platelets release numerous cytokines and organic substances and undergo drastic morphological changes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gear and Camerini, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jackson, 2007</a>). Thus, platelet activation is highly energy-dependent and relies heavily on fully functional mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kramer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Garcia-Souza and Oliveira, 2014</a>). Platelet mitochondrial dysfunction leads to reduced ATP production, impaired calcium buffering, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and even programmed cell death, which becomes evident in diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bosetti et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Guo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shrivastava et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mason et al., 2007</a>). It is unclear whether dysfunctional mitochondria are the cause or consequence of these diseases. General autophagy occurs in platelets in response to starvation in an ATG5-dependent fashion (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Feng et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ouseph et al., 2015</a>); however, the physiological relevance of autophagy in platelets is unclear. A\u00a0recent report suggests that mitophagy in diabetic platelets protects against severe oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2016</a>). Platelet activation is a major (patho-)physiological mechanism that underlies atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction acute coronary syndromes and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-related damage, and thus anti-platelet therapy is important for managing many cardiovascular diseases (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nagareddy and Smyth, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gawaz et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Du, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ruggeri, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Li et al., 2015</a>). However, these diseases are still major threats to human life and new therapeutic interventions are required to protect the heart against acute I/R injury."

The mice were established in the animal center at Nanjing University and raised in the Center for Experimental Animals at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. Mice with germline knockout of <i>Fundc1</i> (F1KO) are grossly normal and fertile. They have a\u00a0normal blood count and spleen size (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To induce mitophagy in mice, we exposed the animals to oxygen levels of 8% for 72 hr in a hypoxic chamber. We then examined biochemical hallmarks of mitophagy by measuring mitochondrial protein levels (Tom 20 for the mitochondrial outer membrane; COXII and Tim 23 for the inner membrane), P62 levels and LC3-II expression in liver, skeletal muscle and heart from both wild-type (WT) and F1KO mice. Levels of mitochondrial proteins and P62 were reduced in response to hypoxia in tissues isolated from WT mice, although the degree of degradation differs in different tissues. Degradation of these proteins was blocked in F1KO mice. LC3-II levels were significantly increased in hypoxic wild-type tissues, whereas LC3-I levels were maintained in F1KO tissues under the same conditions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Prolonged hypoxia strongly depleted mitochondrial proteins and other mitophagy marker proteins in platelets isolated from WT but not F1KO mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Under similar conditions, the ER marker calnexin and the Golgi marker GM130 showed little change (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). FUNDC1 is normally phosphorylated at Tyr18 by Src kinase and becomes dephosphorylated under hypoxic conditions, thus increasing its affinity with LC3 for the activation of mitophagy. We observed that FUNDC1 becomes dephosphorylated and its protein levels are decreased due to mitophagy in response to hypoxia in WT platelets (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Transmission electron microscopy also revealed a mitochondrion enclosed within a double-membrane autophagic membrane in platelets isolated from hypoxic WT mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, mitophagosomes were not observed in platelets from hypoxic F1KO mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). As expected, ex vivo assays in which platelets were isolated and then treated with hypoxia or FCCP, a commonly used inducer of mitophagy, showed almost identical mitophagy phenotypes to those in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>). Next, we examined whether FUNDC1 physically interacts with LC3 to mediate hypoxia-induced mitophagy in vivo, as we previously showed in cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) analysis revealed that FUNDC1 strongly interacted with LC3 in platelets isolated from WT mice exposed to hypoxia for 72 hr. Little interaction was detected in platelets from untreated WT mice, and no interaction was detected in the platelets from treated or untreated F1KO mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Similarly, ex vivo treatment of platelets exposed to hypoxia (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>) or FCCP (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>) also induced the interaction of FUNDC1 with LC3 in WT platelets, but not in F1KO platelets. Collectively, these data demonstrate that FUNDC1 interacts with LC3 to mediate mitophagy in physiological settings."

In contrast, biochemical mitophagic hallmarks were evident in leukocytes from both <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> and <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre+</sup></i> mice (unpublished observation). Ex vivo treatment of <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> platelets, but not <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre+</sup></i> platelets, also induced typical mitophagic changes under hypoxia (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D,F</a>). We previously showed that <i>Atg5</i>, the master regulator for general autophagy, is also required for FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy (<a href=\"#bib42\">Liu et al., 2012</a>).

However, this has not been unambiguously demonstrated in physiological settings. We asked whether mitophagy affects the quality and functions of mitochondria in platelets. Seahorse analysis revealed that both the maximum mitochondrial oxidative capacity and the basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate were markedly decreased in F1KO platelets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Consistent with our discovery that extensive mitochondrial protein degradation is prevented in F1KO platelets, we found that hypoxic treatments induced significant reduction in oxygen consumption in WT platelets, while it had little effect on platelets from F1KO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Similarly, ATP production was impaired in F1KO platelets, and was also significantly reduced in hypoxia-treated WT platelets compared to untreated WT platelets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The reduced mitochondrial activities in F1KO platelets are likely due to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria owing to defective mitophagy, as mitochondrial mass and ROS were markedly increased in F1KO platelets whereas mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly decreased (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>). These data demonstrate that FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy determines the quality and functional integrity of mitochondria in platelets."

We thus predicted that mitophagy has functional consequences for platelet activation. Exposure of WT mice to hypoxia significantly reduced platelet aggregation, platelet spreading and surface expression of P-selectin upon treatment with thrombin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,H,I</a>), ADP and collagen (unpublished observations). In contrast, aggregation of platelets from F1KO mice was markedly reduced in response to thrombin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,H,I</a>). Similar phenotypes were observed in platelets from both <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,L,M</a>) and <i>Atg5<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2N,P,Q</a>). Mitochondrial activity, represented by mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates, was closely related to the level of platelet aggregation, with a correlation coefficient close to one in platelets from WT, <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> and <i>Atg5<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,K,O</a>). In contrast, platelet activation was compromised in F1KO platelets, <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre+</sup></i> and <i>Atg5<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre+</sup></i> platelets, and was not further reduced by hypoxia (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This reason for this is that genetic ablation of <i>Fundc1</i> or <i>Atg5</i> significantly blocked mitophagy, leading to accumulation of damaged mitochondria. These mitochondria are compromised, but still function at a reasonably high level. This contrasts with platelets in wild-type mice under prolonged hypoxia, where mitochondria are largely depleted and have lost most of their functions. This is also a specific effect, because there was no significant change in the levels of the ADP receptor P2Y12 and the thrombin receptors (PARs), and downstream signaling mediated by the platelet integrin receptor IIbIIIa (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013G</a>). Megakaryocyte differentiation was also identical in WT and F1KO mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Deficiency of <i>Fundc1</i> did not enhance apoptosis in platelets in response to ABT737 (10 \u03bcM) under our experimental conditions, as measured by phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and activation of caspase-3 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Intraperitoneal injection of the unphosphorylated peptide (P), but not the phosphorylated peptide which was used as a control (C), effectively blocked hypoxia-induced mitochondrial protein and P62 degradation and the conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II in WT platelets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Neither peptide had any effect in F1KO platelets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

We thus examined the role of mitochondrial functional integrity in platelets on I/R-induced heart injury. To avoid the complication of I/R-induced mitophagy in cardiomyocytes, we used <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre+</sup></i> mice and applied a widely used model of myocardial infarction by occluding the left coronary artery for 0.5 hr followed by reperfusion for 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre+</sup></i> mice had much smaller heart infarct size (IF/AAR) than <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> mice as revealed by the 2, 3, 5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining assay, and there was no significant difference in area at risk/left ventricle (AAR/LV) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>). Echocardiography analysis showed that myocardial functions in <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre+</sup></i> mice are normal under normoxic conditions, because the basal levels of fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) are comparable to those in <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a>). This suggests that specific knockout of <i>Fundc1</i> in platelets does not affect heart functions.

We further predict that early hyperactivation of platelets causes severe heart injury and hypoxic conditions in blood due to malfunction of the circulation, which may in turn affect mitochondrial function in platelets. To test this, we first detected surface expression of P-selectin on platelets in affected hearts by immunohistochemistry at different time points following I/R (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,H</a>). In agreement with early platelet activation as reported previously, we found that P-selectin surface expression was induced following I/R in hearts. Also, consistent with the high degree of heart injury, P-selectin surface expression was significantly higher in <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> mice than that in <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre+</sup></i> mice during I/R (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,M</a>). I/R injury causes malfunction of the heart which reduces the oxygen supply in the blood and the reduced oxygen level may trigger mitophagy in platelets. Indeed, blood oxygen saturation measurements revealed that I/R treatment significantly reduced the oxygen saturation levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Western blotting analysis revealed that platelet mitophagy occurred in <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> mice within 24 hr of I/R, and it was blocked in <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre+</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). Correspondingly, mitochondrial OCR and ATP levels were both significantly reduced in platelets from <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> mice after I/R (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K,L</a>). Thus, we detected two phases of platelet activation depending on the oxygen levels. Following initial ischemia and reperfusion, the heart injury causes platelet activation at the injury site and in the microcirculation, which causes heart malfunctions and reduced blood oxygen levels. At later time points, both the surface expression level of P-selectin and the aggregation level of platelets isolated from <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> progressively declined compared to sham controls as the reperfusion time increased (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4M,N</a>). These results further support our notion that mitophagy occurs in platelets in response to decreased oxygen levels in platelets to regulate mitochondrial activity and platelet activation."

We hypothesized that hypoxic mitophagy in platelets may be important for the protective effect of hypoxic preconditioning against I/R-induced cardiac injury. To test this, we exposed <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> mice to hypoxia for 72 hr in the presence or absence of peptides before I/R was performed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Hypoxic preconditioning of the <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> mice strongly blocked I/R-induced heart injury (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>), and this was reversed by the administration of peptide P, but not the control peptide C. Likewise, hypoxic preconditioning maintained heart functions, as evaluated by FS and EF, and this protective effect was reduced by peptide P, but not peptide C (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). This is probably because the combination of hypoxia and peptide regulates the level of mitophagy in platelets, which determines the degree of platelet activation. Indeed, hypoxic preconditioning prevented P-selectin surface expression in platelets under I/R (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), and this was reversed by peptide P, but not peptide C. Similarly, both surface expression of P-selectin and platelet aggregation were reduced by I/R or hypoxia or both, and these changes were prevented by peptide P, but not peptide C (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>). Moreover, peptide P, but not C, also prevented the hypoxia-induced loss of mitochondrial functions as measured by mitochondrial OCR and ATP levels in platelets from <i>Fundc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>::Pf4<sup>Cre-</sup></i> mice 24 hr after I/R (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I,J</a>). Biochemical analysis revealed that peptide P, but not C, prevented hypoxic and I/R-induced mitophagy (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>).

We also showed that hypoxic mitophagy dictates the level of mitochondrial activity, which is related to the level of platelet activity. In response to hypoxia caused by either environmental stress conditions or by prolonged I/R, mitophagy occurs in vivo in a FUNDC1- and ATG5-dependent manner, and a peptide containing the unphosphorylated LIR motif of FUNDC1 effectively blocks hypoxia- and I/R-induced mitophagy in platelets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This suggests a unique strategy for intervening in mitophagy in vivo. Administration of the unphosphorylated peptide prevents extensive mitophagy under prolonged hypoxic conditions, thus blocking mitochondrial depletion and platelet inactivation. In contrast, loss of FUNDC1 results in compromised mitochondrial functions and reduces platelet activity to a low but constant level which is insensitive to hypoxia or peptides. These results show that hypoxic mitophagy is functionally significant for mitochondrial quality control and degradation and suggest that a new layer of regulation is involved in the response of platelets to (patho-)physiological stimuli."

Elegant studies have focused on the molecular process by which the autophagy machinery is engaged to activate mitochondrial clearance in cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lazarou et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Novak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Ablation of the genes encoding mitophagy receptors causes the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria in different tissues (<a href=\"#bib52\">Novak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zhang and Ney, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gong et al., 2015</a>). However, definitive proof for mitophagic regulation of mitochondrial quality <i>in vivo</i> is still lacking. For example, Parkin is rare in normal hearts and is dispensable for constitutive mitophagic quality control. Parkin-mediated mitophagy acts as an acute stress-reactive pathway to remove damaged mitochondria as originally proposed (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dorn, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Youle and Narendra, 2011</a>). Taking advantage of the unique platelet system, we clearly showed that FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy regulates mitochondrial quality and quantity in both normoxic and in hypoxic conditions. It appears that platelets in FUNDC1 knockout mice have increased mitochondrial mass (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), decreased mitochondrial function (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and reduced platelet activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) even under normoxic conditions, rendering the platelets insensitive to peptide P and hypoxic treatments. We also detected biochemical hallmarks of mitophagy in tissues such as liver, muscle and heart in wild-type mice when they were treated with hypoxia. although the level of change differs in different tissues (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, these changes are largely blocked in <i>Fundc1</i>-deficient mice. These data suggest that there is a tissue-specific effect of mitophagy in response to hypoxia, and this is likely due to distinct mechanisms for balancing mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis in the hypoxic stress response. It is also possible that different mitophagy mediators are involved in different tissues and further investigation is underway to study mitophagy in <i>Parkin</i> and <i>Nix</i> knockout mice."

Perturbation of mitochondrial homeostasis and cellular energetics worsens the outcome following hypoxic-ischemic insults (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nanayakkara et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Garc\u00eda-Rivas and Torre-Amione, 2009</a>). Selective removal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy was thus regarded as a critical protective mechanism against I/R injury in the heart and other organs. It is well documented that Parkin-mediated mitophagy is an important regulatory mechanism in myocardial ischemia reperfusion, myocardial infarction and heart failure (<a href=\"#bib28\">Huang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gong et al., 2015</a>). Platelets have been implicated in these processes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gawaz, 2004</a>), but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. It is interesting to note that platelet mitophagy has dual roles in platelet activation and in I/R injury. In the acute phase, mitophagy maintains mitochondrial quality and function by getting rid of damaged mitochondria that are \u2018toxic\u2019, so as to support platelet activation. This leads to occlusion, reduced blood oxygen levels and myocardial infarction, and explains how loss of mitophagy reduces I/R injury to a certain extent. In the prolonged phase, extensive elimination of mitochondria (maybe even good-quality and partially functional ones) due to hypoxia renders the platelets less active, preventing excess I/R-induced injury. This may serve as a negative self-regulation mechanism to prevent excessive platelet activation and myocardial injury, which has long been observed in the clinical setting. We thus revealed that hypoxic mitophagy in platelets is causally linked with I/R-induced heart injury, and that mitophagy in platelets plays a dual role in the I/R injury of hearts."

                        "text": "We have shown that hypoxic preconditioning induces extensive mitochondrial degradation and drastic inactivation of platelet activity, thus preventing I/R injury. Our results may help to explain how preconditioning with ischemia/hypoxia or clinically available volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane could have a beneficial effect in reducing myocardial I/R injury (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fullmer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). These preconditioning agents affect oxygen levels in the blood or in the heart (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fullmer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 2015</a>), thus activating mitophagy in platelets to reduce platelet activation and I/R injury. This is of clinical significance and our preliminary clinical studies have shown that mitophagy in platelets occurs in patients with hypoxemia and myocardial infarction (unpublished observations). We also showed that peptide P can effectively block hypoxia-induced mitophagy. Administration of peptide P is the first plausible method for manipulating mitophagy in vivo and fighting IR-induced heart injury. In contrast to previous interventions that center on cardiomyocytes or platelet surface receptors (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gawaz, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">McFadyen and Jackson, 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib12\">Du, 2007</a>), our results suggest a novel strategy for cardioprotective intervention by targeting mitophagy in platelets through hypoxia and administration of agents that promote mitophagy. The detrimental effects of acute I/R injury contribute to morbidity and mortality through a wide range of pathologies including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute kidney injury and circulatory arrest-related damage, and I/R injury is also a major challenge during organ transplantation and vascular and general surgery (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yellon and Hausenloy, 2007</a>). Therefore, targeting mitophagy both in cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dorn et al., 2015</a>) and platelets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) or reducing mitochondrial activity by pharmacological and biochemical means will offer new life-saving strategies for fighting these deadly clinical complications."

Moreover, the authors convincingly showed that in WT, hypoxia greatly induces platelet mitophagy, reduces platelet mitochondrial quality, and inactivates platelets; these hypoxic effects are blunted by genetic loss of <i>Fundc1</i> or a cell-penetrating, peptide inhibitor specific to <i>Fundc1</i>-mediated mitophagy. Besides revealing (patho) physiological settings for <i>Fundc1</i>-mediated mitophagy, this work is also highly significant from the translational point of views: The authors show that platelet-specific KO of <i>Fundc1</i> or <i>Atg5</i> reduces I/R injury and protects heart function in a mouse model of myocardial infarction. The authors further show that hypoxic preconditioning, which leads to platelet mitophagy, impairs ATP-producing oxidative phosphorylation and platelet activation, ameliorating I/R injury in mice in a <i>Fundc1</i>-mediated mitophagy-dependent manner. This work provides a possible novel route for preventing severe I/R injury by inducing platelet mitophagy and inactivating platelets a priori. Overall, the work is interesting. The reviewers found that additional work is required to strengthen the manuscript to meet the standards for <i>eLife</i>."
