We report that a myosin is polarized anteriorly in these cells and strongly colocalizes with Stbm. Disruption of the actin/myosin machinery with cytochalasin or blebbistatin disrupts polarization of Pk and Stbm, but not of myosin complexes, suggesting a PCP-independent aspect of myosin localization. Wash out of cytochalasin restored Pk polarization, but not if done in the presence of blebbistatin, suggesting an active role for myosin in core PCP protein localization. On the other hand, in the <i>pk</i> mutant line, <i>aimless</i>, myosin polarization is disrupted in approximately one third of the cells, indicating a reciprocal action of core PCP signaling on myosin localization. Our results indicate a complex relationship between the actomyosin cytoskeleton and core PCP components in which myosin is not simply a downstream target of PCP signaling, but also required for PCP protein localization."

We report that a myosin is polarized anteriorly in these cells and strongly colocalizes with Stbm. Disruption of the actin/myosin machinery with cytochalasin or blebbistatin disrupts polarization of Pk and Stbm, but not of myosin complexes, suggesting a PCP-independent aspect of myosin localization. Wash out of cytochalasin restored Pk polarization, but not if done in the presence of blebbistatin, suggesting an active role for myosin in core PCP protein localization. On the other hand, in the <i>pk</i> mutant line, <i>aimless</i>, myosin polarization is disrupted in approximately one third of the cells, indicating a reciprocal action of core PCP signaling on myosin localization. Our results indicate a complex relationship between the actomyosin cytoskeleton and core PCP components in which myosin is not simply a downstream target of PCP signaling, but also required for PCP protein localization."

Once correctly orientated, these filaments\u2014known as microtubules\u2014have been proposed to help position the components of the core PCP pathway such that they can correctly orientate the rest of the cell."

The cells of the notochord become polarized as they develop. When microtubules are disrupted, their planar polarity remains unaffected. However, when another network of filaments\u2014called the actomyosin network\u2013\u2013is chemically disrupted, the polarity of certain core PCP components is lost."

The PCP pathway is ancient in metazoans, and its requirement for proper development and physiology has been well described in insects (e.g., <i>Drosophila</i>) and chordates. The function of the PCP pathway can be seen in the coordinated polarization of subcellular components such as cilia and multi-celled structures such as bristles in epithelial sheets and organs like the <i>Drosophila</i> wing, vertebrate inner ear, and kidney, as well as in dynamic processes, such as cell migration, convergence and extension of mesoderm, neural tube closure, and axonal guidance (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wallingford, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Tissir and Goffinet, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Papakrivopoulou et al., 2014</a>). One of the complicating issues of PCP signaling in <i>Drosophila</i>, where it has been most extensively addressed, is that it appears to consist of several semi-independent pathways that may act either in parallel or in sequence (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gray et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lawrence and Casal, 2013</a>). The best characterized of these pathways is the core PCP pathway, which acts locally to coordinate polarity between neighboring cells. The key components of the core pathway include the transmembrane proteins Strabismus/Van Gogh and Frizzled, and the cytoplasmic proteins Prickle and Dishevelled. Some components of this pathway are shared with the wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, although unlike the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway the core PCP pathway is thought to act primarily by directing cytoskeletal organization, rather than by regulating transcription."

The precise nature of this so-called \u2018global\u2019 signaling pathway has been elusive, although several candidate pathways are supported experimentally. One model for the <i>Drosophila</i> global polarizer stresses the importance of mechanical forces generated during morphogenesis leading to the alignment of cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eaton and J\u00fclicher, 2011</a>). Two signaling pathways have also been proposed to act as global polarizers\u2014the Wg/Wnt4 pathway (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wu et al., 2013</a>), and the Dachsous (Ds)/Fat/Four-jointed (Fj) pathway (<a href=\"#bib4\">Casal et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Thomas and Strutt, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Matis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Olofsson et al., 2014</a>). The Ds/Fat/Fj module has been most extensively characterized and appears to signal via formation of heterodimers with the extracellular domains of Ds and Fat (which are atypical cadherins), putatively in a gradient across the tissue (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bosveld et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>). Most recently, it was reported that the Ds/Fat/Fj module affects polarity through microtubule orientation, which in turn directs core PCP polarization (<a href=\"#bib26\">Matis et al., 2014</a>). Fat and Ds orthologs also play roles in vertebrate development, but their precise roles in regulating aspects of PCP remain to be clarified (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Saburi et al., 2012</a>). One final complicating factor in assessing the role of the Fat/Ds/Fj pathway in planar polarity is the apparent overlap with the growth-stimulating Hippo pathway (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lawrence and Casal, 2013</a>)."

While the presence of the notochord\u2014a stiff axial rod of mesodermal cells lying under the nerve cord\u2014is a uniting feature of the Chordata, tunicate notochords are much simpler than those of vertebrates, and in <i>Ciona</i> the fully formed notochord consists of only 40 cells arranged in a stack one-cell wide (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kourakis et al., 2014</a>). We have described two discrete developmental phases in notochord morphogenesis that shows polarized cell behavior. Initially, the notochord precursor cells undergo a mediolaterally oriented intercalation behavior, which forms the notochord column along the AP axis. The role of the core PCP pathway in the convergent extension of the <i>Ciona</i> notochord is seen in the <i>pk</i> mutant <i>aimless (aim)</i> of <i>Ciona savignyi</i>, which has defects in notochord cell intercalation behavior, morphology, and extracellular matrix deposition (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Veeman et al., 2008</a>)."

Over the next approximately 3\u20134 hr (corresponding to stages 21\u201324 [<a href=\"#bib17\">Hotta et al., 2007</a>]), the cells undergo a dramatic elongation in the A/P axis, which results in the continued elongation of the entire tail. During the process of elongation, a second polarity becomes evident in the A/P axis (at a right angle to the mediolateral polarity seen earlier at intercalation). The first sign of A/P polarity can be seen shortly after the completion of intercalation (stage 22) in the localization of Pk protein to the anterior poles of the cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kourakis et al., 2014</a>). As elongation continues the core PCP protein Strabismus (Stbm) also localizes to the anterior pole, while nuclei move to the posterior poles of the cells where they take on a flattened shape (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kourakis et al., 2014</a>). The exception to this pattern is the posterior-most notochord cell whose nucleus is usually found in reverse orientation relative to the other cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kourakis et al., 2014</a>). In <i>aim</i> embryos, the nuclei of intercalated cells are still polarized, but they are randomly oriented to either the anterior or posterior pole of each cell (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kourakis et al., 2014</a>). Following elongation, the notochord enters a new phase in its development (from stage 24 onward). A matrix is secreted into extracellular pockets that form between A and P faces of the cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Denker and Jiang, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Deng et al., 2013</a>). As this process continues, the pockets of matrix between the cells expand and then fuse to make a single, uninterrupted lumen along the length of the notochord."

The resulting cDNAs were fused to the <i>Brachyury</i> cis-regulatory region to drive notochord expression (<a href=\"#bib7\">Corbo et al., 1997</a>), and then introduced to embryos by electroporation. Low doses of plasmid were used to encourage highly mosaic expression. This allows the visualization of the exogenous proteins in cells isolated from the expression of neighboring cells, which would otherwise make the determination of anterior vs posterior protein localization difficult (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kourakis et al., 2014</a>). At the earliest developmental stage analyzed, stage 19\u2014when the notochord cells are mid-intercalation, both Myosin10/11/14/9-myc and MRLC9/12-Venus were observed throughout the cells, with the highest localization on the perinotochordal surfaces where cells contact the basement membrane that surrounds the developing notochord (white arrows, stage 19; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib41\">Veeman et al., 2008</a>). At the immediate completion of intercalation (stage 21, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), the localization of both fusion proteins was still the strongest at the basal/lateral edges. However, less than an hour later, at stage 22, both proteins were found localized to the anterior pole of each notochord cell (arrowhead, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), as well as continuing to be found at the basal/lateral edges. Quantification of MRLC9/12-Venus fluorescence signal along the anterior/posterior axis of notochord cells confirms a distinct transition in MRLC9/12-Venus localization between stages 21 and 22 (insets, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). During notochord cell elongation, and at its completion (stage 24), the anterior localization of both proteins persists (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The onset of anterior/posterior localization of myosin assemblies closely matches the localization of Pk-myc, with A/P localization of Pk-myc starting at stage 22 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kourakis et al., 2014</a>). However, the Pk-myc and MRLC9/12 proteins do not appear to completely colocalize spatially. At stage 22, Pk-myc, Myosin10/11/14/9-myc, and MRLC9/12-Venus are each found to be enriched on the anterior side of the cells. However, as elongation progresses, Pk-myc localization becomes restricted to a small region within the center of this domain (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kourakis et al., 2014</a>), while Myosin10/11/14/9-myc and MRLC9/12-Venus remain more dispersed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

Latrunculin B, which inhibits actin polymerization by a different mechanism than cytochalasin B (<a href=\"#bib27\">Morton et al., 2000</a>), also caused a loss of nuclear, Stbm-Venus, and Pk-myc polarization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,F</a>). Only 5% and 4% of latrunculin B treated embryos showed localized Stbm-Venus and Pk-myc, respectively, vs 92% of controls (n = 57, 25, and 25). The stage 23 treatments demonstrated that cytochalasin B could disrupt the notochord cell polarity once it was established. To examine the effect of cytochalasin B on the establishment of polarity, embryos were treated at stage 21 and scored at stage 23. In these embryos, no polarization of Pk-myc was evident in any of the cells scored (n = 5) vs 92% of cells from vehicle (DMSO)-treated embryos (n = 12) having normal anterior polarization of Pk-myc."

Likewise, Pk-myc was observed to relocalize to anterior membranes upon wash out of cytochalasin B (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In assessing Pk-myc repolarization, a sample of embryos was first collected at the end of the cytochalasin B treatment to assure the efficacy of the treatment. In cells from this first group of embryos, anterior localization of Pk-myc was observed in only one of 33 cells scored. 1 hr after cytochalasin B was washed out, 13 out of 18 cells scored had re-established anterior localization of Pk-myc (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

The cells undergo a dramatic shape change, the polarization of Pk-myc, Stbm-Venus, and nuclei is lost, and the localization of aPKC is disrupted. Despite this, polarization of MRLC9/12-Venus persists, and much of the actin network remains cortical, although fragmented (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Inhibition of myosin motor activity with blebbistatin gives similar effects on Pk-myc and nuclei. Thus, in blebbistatin-treated cells or cytochalasin B-treated cells, while the actin and myosin machinery are inactivated, they appear to remain polarized and cortical. Removal of embryos from cytochalasin B allows the recovery of Pk-myc and nuclei, but not in the presence of blebbistatin. Together, these results support an active role for actin/myosin machinery in repolarization of core PCP proteins and nuclei. Consistent with this, latrunculin treatment, while not disrupting MRLC9/12-Venus localization, caused a much more extensive disruption the cortical actin network than did cytochalasin B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). These cells do not recover nuclear or Pk-myc polarization when removed from latrunculin, presumably because of the more extensive loss of the actin network. In summary, despite the loss of Stbm and Pk localization in cytochalasin-treated cells a polarity persists that can restore proper core PCP and nuclei polarity. This persistent polarity appears to be the actin/myosin machinery."

PCP-directed polarization of actin is also seen in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing, where the actin-rich prehair is targeted to the distal side, opposite where pk and stbm are enriched (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wong and Adler, 1993</a>). Our results in the <i>Ciona</i> notochord indicate a more complex interaction in which these components are mutually reinforcing rather than being in a simple linear pathway. Additionally, and in contrast to results in other experimental systems (<a href=\"#bib36\">Shimada et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Harumoto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vladar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Matis et al., 2014</a>), we find no evidence of a role for the microtubule network in the localization of either PCP components Pk and Stbm, or MRLC9/12."

This is further supported by the fact that the disruption of the actin/myosin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin, latrunculin, or blebbistatin all result in the loss of polarization of Pk and Stbm. Conversely, these same treatments leave the polarization of MRLC9/12 largely intact. Thus, Myosin10/11/14/9 in the notochord appears to localize in the absence of core PCP protein localization, similar to the situation for the atypical myosin Dachs in <i>Drosophila</i>, which is also polarized independently of the core PCP pathway (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>). It should be noted, however, that no direct ortholog of Dachs is found in chordate genomes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mao et al., 2006</a>). Moreover, the persistence of MRLC9/12 localization when Pk and Stbm are delocalized (e.g., cytochalasin treatment), and the requirement for myosin activity during repolarization after cytochalasin treatment, suggest that myosin polarization in <i>Ciona</i> notochord cells could act upstream of core PCP localization. However, it is important to note that in the developing notochord, Pk, Myosin10/11/14/9, and MRLC9/12 all appear to simultaneously localize in the A/P axis between stages 21 and 22 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and [<a href=\"#bib22\">Kourakis et al., 2014</a>]). Thus, the timing of events would argue against a simple model in which myosin localization precedes and directs Pk polarization. Moreover, it has also been observed that polarization of Stbm lags behind that of Pk (and thus also of myosin) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>), indicating that the core PCP machinery is still assembling at the time we first see polarized myosin."

While the <i>pk</i> allele in <i>aim</i> contains an \u223c200 base-pair deletion that spans one intron and an adjacent exon, creating a premature stop codon and a likely null allele (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>), and the <i>Ciona</i> genome contains only a single <i>pk</i> gene, one possible explanation for the variability between cells is that residual Pk-independent PCP activity remains in a subset of the notochord cells in <i>aim</i> embryos. However, by other measures of cell polarity, such as extension and protrusive activity along the mediolaterial axis during intercalation, and the membrane localization of Dishevelled, we see no evidence for residual PCP activity in <i>aim</i> embryos, and moreover, all notochord cells appear to be uniformly disrupted (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Veeman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kourakis et al., 2014</a>). Thus, we surmise that many cells in the notochord are able to properly polarize myosin without input from the core PCP pathway. The notochord cells in <i>aim</i> embryos show a highly consistent pattern in which those having posterior localized nuclei (i.e., the wild-type pattern) have anterior polarized myosin, while those with inverted nuclei polarity (anterior) lacked detectable myosin polarity, rather than having inverted myosin polarity. We speculate that those cells in <i>aim</i> embryos showing wild-type nuclear polarity are correctly aligned with a global polarizing cue, and can polarize their myosin complex, while those cells showing anterior nuclei are not in alignment, and myosin does not polarize properly. The role of the core PCP pathway, which is lacking in the <i>aim</i> cells, is thus to act locally to bring the cells into proper alignment. Despite this observation, disruption of Pk and Stbm localization with cytochalasin C, latrunculin, or blebbistatin has relatively little effect on MRLC9/12 localization. One potentially important difference between these two examples is that the <i>aim</i> mutants are null for <i>pk</i> from fertilization, while the cytoskeletal inhibitors are added post-intercalation. Thus, while we see no evidence of A/P polarization until approximately 1 hr after the completion of intercalation (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), earlier events during intercalation may be required for the establishment of A/P polarity. The nature of these events and the mechanism that switches notochord polarity from mediolateral to A/P remain unknown."

This is a particularly interesting one in which to study PCP. Previous work from the same group has shown that polarity of Core PCP proteins change dynamically as cells shift from intercalation to AP polarization, so some new insights into the diversity of polarization signals may emerge from this system. Furthermore the Core PCP proteins appear to be wired up somewhat differently than in <i>Drosophila</i> (Dsh and Pk are on the same side of the cell). Here, they have demonstrated that myosin, like Pk, becomes anteriorly polarized, and they present data suggesting that the actin-myosin cytoskeleton is important to maintain anterior localization of Pk and Stbm. This requirement is bidirectional to some extent because myosin localization is occasionally perturbed in the Pk mutant <i>aimless</i>. This would be a novel contribution to the PCP field: while it has been clear that Core PCP can influence the actin cytoskeleton, we are not aware of any data showing the reverse."

A principal concern is the specificity of the phenotypes caused by perturbing actin and the myosin components MRLC9/12 and Myosin10/11/14/9. In general, the study relies too extensively on drug treatments without addressing the obvious caveat that these could exert non-specific effects by acting on neighboring tissues. For example, knock-down of the MLRC9/12 and/or Myosin10/11/14/9 genes and analyses of the effects on Pk and Stbm polarization would adequately complement the blebbistatin study. Much value will be added by independent ways of down-regulating cytoskeletal components, such as the use of Morpholinos or more recent CRISPR methods to knockdown components specifically in the notochord. If the authors can manage these additional experiments in a reasonable time-frame, the results and analysis could place the work on a more robust footing."

The authors show that polarity can be recovered upon washing the drug cytochalasin, but not latrunculin. Blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin II, is presented as blocking the recovery of Pk-myc and Stbm-Venus repolarization following cytochalasin washout. As shown this data is not convincing. Blebbistatin does not seem to disrupt myosin localization. Is there something that we are missing?"

In general, the results need to be presented with clear interpretation or conclusions about the biological mechanisms which they reveal. The absence of this is pervasive from the Abstract through the Results and Discussion. The discussion invokes elusive and hypothetical cell autonomous and global polarization mechanisms, which weaken the paper rather than clarifying the main conclusions. The final model summarizes the observations while it could instead propose a mechanism to explain how PCP components and myosin regulate each other's localization. The authors use the drug nocodazole to effectively disrupt the microtubule cytoskeleton and observed no effect on the polarization of the PCP components. They conclude that the microtubules are dispensable for polarized distribution of Pk and Stbm. However, these treatments were apparently performed at a stage following the initial polarization, meaning that microtubules may be dispensable for the local steady-state maintenance of polarized distribution but not for the initial polarization. It would be important to perform the treatments and analyses at different time points, especially before the initial polarization, to conclude on this negative result. For myosin, only subcellular localization is showed while one could use anti phospho-myosin antibodies (as in Sherrard et al, Curr Biol, 2010, 20(17), 1-12) to ask if active myosin is localized to the anterior side of the cells. Colocalization analyses between PCP and Myosin components in both control and drug-treated (or knockdown) embryos would probably illuminate specific aspects of the crosstalk. It would be interesting to test if PCP components and myosin colocalize in control embryos whereas this would be disrupted upon cytochalasin, latrunculin and/or blebbistatin treatments."

A principal concern is the specificity of the phenotypes caused by perturbing actin and the myosin components MRLC9/12 and Myosin10/11/14/9. In general, the study relies too extensively on drug treatments without addressing the obvious caveat that these could exert non-specific effects by acting on neighboring tissues. For example, knock-down of the MLRC9/12 and/or Myosin10/11/14/9 genes and analyses of the effects on Pk and Stbm polarization would adequately complement the blebbistatin study. Much value will be added by independent ways of down-regulating cytoskeletal components, such as the use of Morpholinos or more recent CRISPR methods to knockdown components specifically in the notochord. If the authors can manage these additional experiments in a reasonable time-frame, the results and analysis could place the work on a more robust footing</i>."

Therefore we would not be able to assess their role in A/P polarity because the morphogenesis would arrest too early in development. This is exactly what we see when cytoskeletal disrupting drugs are added during intercalation. All existing protocols for gene knockdown in <i>Ciona</i> require introduction of morpholinos or CRISPR plasmids at the one cell stage, and methods that would allow us to temporally target the knockdown postintercalation have not been developed in <i>Ciona</i>. Moreover, we feel that the reviewers\u2019 concern about \u201cnon-specific effects by acting on neighboring tissues\u201d should not be a major concern.
