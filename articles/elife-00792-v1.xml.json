Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i> and <i>Shigella flexneri</i> injectisomes in situ and the first structural analysis of the <i>Yersinia</i> injectisome. Unexpectedly, basal bodies of injectisomes inside the bacterial cells showed length variations of 20%. The in situ structures of the <i>Y. enterocolitica</i> and <i>S. flexneri</i> injectisomes had similar dimensions and were significantly longer than the isolated structures of related injectisomes. The crystal structure of the inner membrane injectisome component YscD appeared elongated compared to a homologous protein, and molecular dynamics simulations documented its elongation elasticity. The ring-shaped secretin YscC at the outer membrane was stretched by 30\u201340% in situ, compared to its isolated liposome-embedded conformation. We suggest that elasticity is critical for some two-membrane spanning protein complexes to cope with variations in the intermembrane distance."

Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i> and <i>Shigella flexneri</i> injectisomes in situ and the first structural analysis of the <i>Yersinia</i> injectisome. Unexpectedly, basal bodies of injectisomes inside the bacterial cells showed length variations of 20%. The in situ structures of the <i>Y. enterocolitica</i> and <i>S. flexneri</i> injectisomes had similar dimensions and were significantly longer than the isolated structures of related injectisomes. The crystal structure of the inner membrane injectisome component YscD appeared elongated compared to a homologous protein, and molecular dynamics simulations documented its elongation elasticity. The ring-shaped secretin YscC at the outer membrane was stretched by 30\u201340% in situ, compared to its isolated liposome-embedded conformation. We suggest that elasticity is critical for some two-membrane spanning protein complexes to cope with variations in the intermembrane distance."

YscD, a protein that extends across the periplasmic space, was crystallized and its structure was then determined and used to develop a computer model to assess its compressibility: this model indicated that YscD could stretch or contract by up to 50% of its total length. The outer membrane component YscC also appeared elastic: when the protein was isolated and introduced into synthetic membranes, its length was reduced 30\u201340% relative to that observed in intact bacterial membranes."

The assembly of the injectisome involves some 34 different proteins. Many of these proteins form the structure, while others act as ancillary components driving the assembly process. Phylogenic analyses based on the most conserved proteins classify injectisomes into seven different families (Ysc, Ssa-Esc, Inv-Mxi-Spa, Hrc1, Hrc2, Rhizobiales, and Chlamydiales) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Pallen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Troisfontaines and Cornelis, 2005</a>).

The basal body presents a barrel-shaped structure at the outer membrane (OM), with double ring-shaped densities underneath in the periplasmic space and the inner membrane (IM). These rings are formed by three multimeric proteins (YscC,D,J in <i>Yersinia spp</i>; InvG, PrgH,K in <i>Salmonella</i> SPI-1; MxiD,J,G in <i>S. flexneri</i>). The barrel-shaped structure spanning the OM and protruding into the periplasm consists of a 12\u201315 mer of a protein from the secretin family (YscC, InvG, MxiD) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Burghout et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Marlovits et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hodgkinson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Spreter et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schraidt and Marlovits, 2011</a>). The lower double-ring reaching into the IM is made of a lipoprotein (YscJ, PrgK, MxiJ) proposed to form a 24-subunit ring (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kimbrough and Miller, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Crepin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yip et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Silva-Herzog et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hodgkinson et al., 2009</a>) and a protein that is not so conserved as the others, but shares a similar modular domain architecture and acts as a connector between the secretin and the IM (YscD, PrgH, MxiG) (<a href=\"#bib76\">Spreter et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Diepold et al., 2010</a>).

The recent crystal structure of the C-terminus of the export gate of the cytoplasmic export apparatus MxiA from <i>S. flexneri</i> revealed a ring arrangement and allowed a mechanistic insight into secretion control (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abrusci et al., 2013</a>)."

Importantly, we document length adaptations of the injectisome basal body to variations in the distance between the bacterial inner and outer membranes.

Since thick cells reduced the quality of tomographic imaging, we genetically engineered <i>Y. enterocolitica</i> minicells that were thinner and still had assembled injectisomes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Reduced thickness allowed for imaging conditions permitting a higher resolution reconstruction (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kudryashev et al., 2012a</a>). Sub-tomogram averaging of volumes containing injectisomes from tomograms of <i>Y. enterocolitica</i> minicells and focal pair tomograms (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kudryashev et al., 2012b</a>) of wild type, regularly sized cells were performed using a customized local feature alignment strategy to compensate for structural variations among individual injectisomes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). This yielded a reconstruction of the injectisome in situ at \u223c4 nm resolution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The shape of the average structure is similar to what is expected from the current structural model (<a href=\"#bib81\">Worrall et al., 2011</a>); the main components of the basal body were assigned as YscC and YscDJ rings following this nomenclature (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and the secretin YscC was assumed inserted into the outer membrane. YscD is known to have four periplasmic domains. The first three are thought to form a ring structure in analogy to homologues (<a href=\"#bib76\">Spreter et al., 2009</a>), while the fourth domain mediates the interaction with YscC (<a href=\"#bib68\">Ross and Plano, 2011</a>).

                                "text": "In order to investigate the origin of the unexpected basal body flexibility observed by cryo-ET, we determined the crystal structure of the first three periplasmic domains of YscD from <i>Y. enterocolitica</i> (residues 150\u2013362). The 2.7 \u00c5 resolution structure of YscD<sup>150\u2013362</sup> (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>) showed three linearly arranged domains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Each domain comprises an \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2-ring building motif, which superposes well with corresponding motifs in the three domains of the homologous PrgH from <i>Salmonella enterica</i> (<a href=\"#bib76\">Spreter et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). However, although sharing the same multi-domain architecture, YscD features an extended conformation, while the domains of PrgH are in a more compact arrangement. The YscD structure points to a high inter-domain flexibility, as already indicated by the high B-factor values of the third domain of <i>wt</i> YscD<sup>150\u2013362</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the connecting hinge (residues A282-N284) between the second and third periplasmic domains is mainly responsible for the high flexibility of YscD (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Based on this observation, we engineered a point mutation (G283P) at the hinge region, in order to stabilize YscD in a less flexible conformation. Mutation of G283 to a proline resulted in a protein that was still functional for type III secretion in vivo (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The 1.4 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of YscD<sup>150\u2013347</sup> G283P had a slightly more bent conformation in the hinge region, but otherwise showed the same extended domain organization as YscD<sup>150\u2013362</sup><i>wt</i>: the first two domains superpose well with the <i>wt</i> structure, while the third domain is tilted by \u223c9\u00b0 with respect to the first two (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast to the <i>wt</i> structure, the refinement statistics for the less flexible YscD<sup>150\u2013347</sup> G283P are in the expected range (e.g., R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> = 18.9/22.6) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Comparison of the dynamic mobility of each structure corroborated this; the proline mutant has lower atomic B-factors and hence a more rigid, but still functional, structure (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

We found that the <i>wt</i> domains, as well as YscD<sup>150\u2013347</sup> G283P, can be arranged in a compact form similar to the corresponding region of the YscD homologue PrgH from <i>Salmonella SPI-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Moreover, the application of stretching forces in MD produced an almost barrier-free transition from the compact to the extended conformation, resulting in a domain arrangement similar to that observed by X-ray crystallography. After this point the forces start to increase due to partial unfolding of secondary structure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Due to this tertiary structure elasticity, that is, the rearrangement of tertiary structure in response to mechanical force, the periplasmic domains of YscD can undergo a maximal elongation of about 3.5 nm (i.e., a 50% elongation compared to the compact conformation), while opposing the stretching with a force as small as 35 \u00b1 15 pN per YscD monomer, a value that is comparable with that estimated for other highly stretchable multi-domain proteins (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hsin and Schulten, 2011</a>). This suggests that the tertiary structural elasticity of the ring components of the periplasmic portion of YscD significantly contributes to the overall elasticity of the basal body of the injectisome in response to external forces."

                                "text": "We constructed a pseudo-atomic model of the inner membrane part of the basal body by combining experimental data with molecular modeling and simulations, similar as to exercised previously to unveil the architecture of large macromolecular complexes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alber et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lasker et al., 2012</a>). Multimers of the YscD and the YscJ proteins were assembled into symmetrical 24-meric ring models using a newly developed optimization protocol based on swarm intelligence heuristic method (<a href=\"#bib21\">Degiacomi and Dal Peraro, 2013</a>). For this, we employed spatial restraints from the in situ cryo-ET map, cross-linking data from the PrgH/PrgK homologues (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sanowar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schraidt et al., 2010</a>), homology models of YscJ based on EscJ, and the conformational ensemble defined by MD simulations of YscD. YscD model structure also includes the transmembrane (TM) domain and the N-terminal cytosolic part of YscD. It does not include the last 70 amino acids of YscD, which interact with the secretin YscC (<a href=\"#bib76\">Spreter et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schraidt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Ross and Plano, 2011</a>), as structural information is lacking. In particular, the TM domain of YscD was modeled as an \u03b1-helix and equilibrated in a membrane bilayer using MD; it connects the two ring densities of YscD on both sides of the IM without any structural strain. The cytosolic domain of the YscD was modeled on the basis of the X-ray structure of the <i>Y. pestis</i> homologue (<a href=\"#bib52\">Lountos et al., 2012</a>), and arranged in a regular ring conformation fitting the electron density observed in the cytoplasmic injectisome regions underneath the IM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The cryo-ET map did not allow a direct density fit in the radial direction, due to the limited resolution of the map; the density corresponding to YscJ was smeared. However, the map revealed the height of the periplasmic domains of YscD and provided a hint for the radius or the ring and thus multimerization state of YscDJ. The assembly of the YscDJ ring (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) revealed that only an elongated arrangement of the C-terminal periplasmic domain of YscD\u2014similar to the X-ray structure\u2014best fits the in situ cryo-ET map, extending up towards the position of the secretin ring. Due to the lack of structural information for the last 70 amino acids of YscD, our model did not include this region, which is responsible for connecting to the secretin YscC (<a href=\"#bib76\">Spreter et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schraidt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Ross and Plano, 2011</a>). Most of the YscD/YscJ interactions occur between the first periplasmic domain of YscD and the C-terminal domain of YscJ. The interacting domains are both tightly anchored to the inner membrane by transmembrane helical segments, providing further stability to the YscDJ ring, and leaving the second and the third domains of YscD free to stretch and interact with the YscC secretin ring."

The isolated and liposome-inserted YscC complexes showed several ring densities: in the membrane bilayer, \u223c5.5 nm below the membrane, and \u223c12 nm below the membrane. A comparison with the ring densities in the in situ reconstruction of the entire injectisome lets us tentatively assign the last ring of the isolated YscC to the third ring density 17 nm below the membrane (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We speculate that this density corresponds to the YscC\u2013YscD junction and also contains the fourth periplasmic domain of YscD of 70 aa, which might affect the length of the YscD structure by 1\u20133 nm, depending on the type of molecular interaction between YscC and YscD. A higher-resolution structure of the YscC\u2013YscD interaction would be needed to determine the exact dimensions. The described assignment of the YscC/YscD junction would correspond to a 30\u201340% length extension of YscC in the assembled injectisome, with respect to its lipid vesicle-reconstituted state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

Biophysical experiments would be required to understand, to which limits the basal body may stretch. In addition to the observed length variations, the injectisome\u2019s basal bodies were longer in the native context than suggested from single particle structures: the <i>Shigella</i> injectisome in situ appeared about 10 nm or \u223c40% longer (32 nm vs 22 nm at the membrane level).

Stretching of YscC by an estimated 5 nm and an elongation of YscD by an estimated 3.5 nm would explain an \u223c8.5 nm overall extension of the <i>Yersinia</i> injectisome\u2019s basal body; the remaining 1.5 nm towards the observed 10 nm elongation of the <i>Shigella</i> system may be attributed to inter-species differences, or the limited resolution of the maps.

In particular, the 24-meric YscD assembly is compatible with the basal body\u2019s diameter, as observed by cryo-EM, while a higher number of YscD units would lead to a poorer match with the experimental data. Moreover, the ring model for the TM and cytosolic domain of YscD further confirms a 24-mer stoichiometry as observed from the optimal fit with the cryo-EM density. The construction and docking of the YscJ 24-mer further supports the proposed stoichiometry. Taking the observed stoichiometry of EscJ into account (<a href=\"#bib19\">Crepin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yip et al., 2005</a>), the model constructed of 24 YscJ molecules does not produce gaps or overlaps in the final structural assembly, as we otherwise obtained when using a higher or lower stoichiometry.

For survival, the bacterial membranes must withstand distance variations, while membrane proteins and complexes must continue to function. We hypothesize that the here observed elasticity might allow the injectisome to better cope with such membrane stresses. This is supported by our finding that exposure of the <i>Y. enterocolitica</i> bacteria to osmotic stress from high salt conditions resulted in a significant elongation of their basal bodies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). It is tempting to speculate on any additional functional role of the observed elasticity, for example, to facilitate substrate secretion through a ratchet pump mechanism (<a href=\"#bib6\">Astumian, 2011</a>). Moreover it would be interesting to quantitatively assess the injectisome\u2019s basal body elongation capabilities with biophysical techniques, for example, atomic force microscopy and force spectroscopy. Recently, it was suggested that injectisomes may rotate upon action (<a href=\"#bib62\">Ohgita et al., 2013</a>), similarly to the evolutionary related flagellar motors. To our knowledge, however, the significantly larger basal bodies of flagellar motors do not vary in length, despite their active rotation.

While our reconstruction made from all injectisomes did not reveal the outer second periplasmic density layer, our MRA data showed in the majority of sub-volume class averages that outer second periplasmic layer at different positions, suggesting that its height also varies among the individual injectisomes with respect to the cytoplasmic membrane. The inner (bottom) periplasmic layer was less well visible in the class averages, suggesting a less defined contact between it and the basal body.

By analyzing the first modes, as independently obtained by EDA and ANM-NMA, we observed that the most relevant collective motions involved bending and rocking of the third domain with respect to the first two. Moreover the most relevant modes suggested the presence of a hinge between the second and third domain, responsible of most of the protein flexibility and causing large displacements of the third domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <i>wt</i>). To assess the role of this hinge in the observed flexibility we performed a set of in silico mutations aimed at reducing the conformational freedom in YscD. We constructed a single (G283P) mutant by atomic replacement from the preliminary crystal structure and subjected the systems to the same simulation protocol and analysis as used for the wild-type protein (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The proline substitution produced a significant damping in the protein motion and a decrease in the atomic positional fluctuation of the third domain.

Additionally, we tested with a similar setup and protocol the compact and straight (as in the X-ray structure) conformation of the G283P YscD mutant. The simulations showed that both straight and bent structures constitute stable conformational states for the YscD protein. As discussed above, the straight conformer showed little variation in the domain arrangement with respect to the initial X-ray structure of YscD, although oscillations of the third domain were observed throughout the simulation. The collapsed conformation diverged slightly from the PrgH structural template, mainly due to a different extension of the flexible loops, and different conformation of the first domain, causing a different domain arrangement; in particular the angle between domains one and two changes from 82\u00b0 (initial geometry/PrgH) to 24 \u00b1 6\u00b0 (average during simulation) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> of the main text).

Starting form the final geometry of the MD simulation (70 ns) the system was extended according to a standard SMD procedure. The C\u03b1 of Asp152 was kept fixed to its initial position while the C\u03b1 of Ans346 was slowly pulled at the constant velocity of 0.5 \u00c5 ns<sup>\u22121</sup> to reduce the effects of hydrodynamic drag force (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hsin and Schulten, 2011</a>). A constant stretching force of 5 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>, resulting in a thermal noise deviation of 0.35 \u00c5, was employed to pull the C\u03b1 of Ans346 along a fixed direction. The end-to-end distance was thus increased from 6.5 nm to 11.5 nm in 100 ns, with the system opposing a force of 35 \u00b1 15 pN for the first 60 ns (100 nm extension); this value is comparable with the force computed, under similar conditions, for the protein titin (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hsin and Schulten, 2011</a>). Further stretching causes the rupture of an increasing number of hydrogen bonds within the \u03b2 strands of the first and third domain, resulting in a progressive growth of the opposing force (above 150 pN). During the SMD simulation the system undergoes a complete stretching from the compact PrgH-like conformation to the fully extended conformation observed in the YscD X-ray structure.

The optimization was guided by spatial restraints extracted from the cryo-EM maps and crosslinking-derived distances from the <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>Shigella</i> D and J orthologues (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sanowar et al., 2010</a>). Namely, loose restraints based on the cryo-ET maps (height = 10 \u00b1 2 nm, width 26 \u00b1 2 nm, inner radius = 8 \u00b1 2 nm) were imposed to ensure the height and width of the assembly to be smaller than, respectively, 10 nm (maximum extension of YscD prior unfolding) and 24 nm (the PrgH rings features a width of about 27 nm). 24 monomers were then distributed according to a circular symmetry imposing a radius of 8 \u00b1 2 nm. Other loose restraints were derived from the cross-linking experiments available for the PrgH/PrgK system after sequence alignment with YscD/YscJ (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sanowar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schraidt et al., 2010</a>), residues between 153 and 160 in YscD were forced to face the YscJ ring and, in particular the region surrounding YscJ-S214. Conformational states extracted from the simulations of the wild-type YscD monomer were used to take into account the native flexibility of YscD and eventually to build the final assembly. The protocol generated six models, all satisfying the initial restraints and producing similar YscD ring arrangement. One of those was selected and further refined by minimization to produce a final structural model of the YscD 24-mer ring interacting with the YscJ ring previously modeled."

The YscD N-terminal cytoplasmic domain has been recently crystallized for the <i>Y. pestis</i> homologue (<a href=\"#bib52\">Lountos et al., 2012</a>), and was modeled using this template, whereas the helical structure of the TM region and its orientation with respect to the membrane bilayer were assessed through MD simulations. The ideal helical reconstruction of the TM segment was relaxed and equilibrated in a membrane bilayer using MD simulations. These additional two domains were eventually linked to the periplasmic YscD ring structure and assembled in a 24-mer conformation. We used again our flexible docking protocol to combine the low-resolution spatial restraints obtained from the cryo-ET maps and the YscD N-terminal structure to assembly the YscD cytoplasmic 24-mer ring (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Essential dynamics analysis was used to extract collective protein motions from the molecular dynamics simulations. Like ANM-NMA, EDA constitutes a powerful method to analyze collective motions in biomolecules. In the EDA approach the collective modes of motions are, however, extracted from a molecular dynamics trajectory rather than from a single structure, and shape and frequency of modes are obtained through diagonalization of the covariance matrix of the \u03b1-carbons motion (<a href=\"#bib5\">Amadei et al., 1993</a>)."

Pow<sup>er</sup> provides predictions for a multimeric structure arrangement on the basis of structural information about its subunits and experimental measures acting as search restraints (as recently shown for the assembly of aerolysin, <a href=\"#bib21a\">Degiacomi et al., 2013</a>). In a first step, an ensemble of monomer conformations is generated, typically from molecular dynamics simulations or structural biology experiments; this ensemble is then treated as a database of conformations. The advantage of this approach is that assembly prediction is performed using physically plausible structures and dynamic features are directly included. Upon definition of a list of geometric restraints (fitness) and a specific circular symmetry, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) search subsequently tries to arrange the elements of the conformational database in a multimeric assembly, so that all restraints are respected, and steric clashes avoided (i.e., part of the fitness function has an 9\u20136 Lennard-Jones-type energy potentials avoiding overlaps of different units). Geometric restraints can be typically provided by low resolution electron density maps or experiments such as cross-linking disulfide scanning, mutagenesis or FRET. If necessary, <i>POW<sup>er</sup></i> can assemble a multimer on a given substrate, like here for the case of YscD ring on top of YscJ ring. At PSO search completion, a set of solutions having a good score is usually generated. A smaller set of representative solutions, typically less than 10, which all satisfy the initial restraints, is then obtained by clustering the accepted solutions according to their respective root mean square deviation (RMSD)."

Further, the substantial differences in structure dependent on the mask used in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> could also hint at this possibility. The authors should rule out this possibility by preferably:"

As you point out, classical sub-tomogram averaging may produce such overfitting, while the \u201cgold standard\u201d procedure reduces this risk by splitting the dataset into two sub-sets and processes these completely independently. Unfortunately, applying this algorithm to sub-volume averaging is challenging if only a low number of sub-volume \u201cparticles\u201d is available. We have now re-processed our injectisome sub-volumes, following the \u201cgold standard\u201d strategy with our \u201cDynamo\u201d software. This resulted in a more conservative resolution estimate of 4 nm for our final injectisome structure. We now describe this \u201cgold standard\u201d processing approach in an additional section within the Materials and methods section and a panel in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, and we have updated the manuscript accordingly."

These dimensions are also supported by intermembrane distances measured at individual single injectisomes that we also show in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>."

The average from all available YscC sub-volumes, however, shows similar dimensions as the individual YscC sub-volumes showed before averaging, which leads us to believe that the sub-volume averaging reports a valid average structure within the specified resolution limits. To provide a reliable estimate of this resolution, we now used the more conservative threshold for the resolution (FSC=0.5), reporting a resolution of 3 nm. We have updated <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and the manuscript accordingly."
