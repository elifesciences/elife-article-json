We devised genetic approaches to define the anatomy of most of these hemilineages and to assessed their functional roles using the heat-sensitive channel dTRPA1. The simplest hemilineages contained local interneurons and their activation caused tonic or phasic leg movements lacking interlimb coordination. The next level was hemilineages of similar projection cells that drove intersegmentally coordinated behaviors such as walking. The highest level involved hemilineages whose activation elicited complex behaviors such as takeoff. These activation phenotypes indicate that the hemilineages vary in their behavioral roles with some contributing to local networks for sensorimotor processing and others having higher order functions of coordinating these local networks into complex behavior."

Even the small CNS of <i>Drosophila</i> has on the order of 100,000 neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Power, 1943</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chiang et al., 2011</a>), each of which is capable of making connections with dozens of synaptic partners. To understand such a complex system, it is helpful to parse its elements into relevant units organized in a functional hierarchy. This approach can be seen in the analysis of the vertebrate brainstem and spinal cord, which are the major sites of sensorimotor processing for locomotor behaviors. In the spinal cord, for example, identified progenitor cells generate discrete pools of interneurons, which in turn have defined roles in producing functional circuits (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</a>). The functional organization of the spinal cord in vertebrates appears to be conserved, in that the progenitor cells and transcription factors that characterize different interneuron classes are conserved from fish through mammals (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lupo et al., 2006</a>) despite the marked differences in modes of locomotion. The hindbrain of the zebra fish is similarly structured from clusters of cell types that are recruited in predictable ways to assemble functional circuits (<a href=\"#bib26\">Koyama et al., 2011</a>)."

Years of work on grasshoppers and other orthopteroid insects (summarized in <a href=\"#bib12\">Burrows, 1996</a>) have defined clusters of spiking and nonspiking interneurons that transform sensory input into changes in leg position during the maintenance of stance (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burrows, 1996</a>) and organize more complex behaviors such as walking (<a href=\"#bib14\">Buschges et al., 2008</a>) and flight (<a href=\"#bib46\">Robertson et al., 1982</a>). As in vertebrates, these clusters follow a developmental logic in which specific clusters arise from the same neuronal stem cell (neuroblast [NB]). In the grasshopper, for example, NB 4-1 has been shown to produce the cluster of midline spiking interneurons that receive exteroceptor input and shape the receptive fields of leg motoneurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shepherd and Laurent, 1992</a>). Similarly, the unpaired medial NB produces the pool of local, midline GABAergic neurons that respond to sound (<a href=\"#bib55\">Thompson and Siegler, 1991</a>)."

Each NB is uniquely identifiable and characterized by its position in the array, its pattern of molecular expression (<a href=\"#bib8\">Broadus and Doe, 1995</a>), and the suite of early neurons that it produces (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bossing et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schmid et al., 1999</a>). Comparative studies between a basal, primitively flightless insect and flying insects showed that the number of thoracic neurons roughly doubled with the evolution of flight. This increase did not come from adding new NBs, but rather was correlated with a subset of the NBs making more neurons by extending their proliferative phase (<a href=\"#bib58\">Truman and Ball, 1998</a>). This mixed proliferative response associated with the evolution of flight is consistent with the idea that particular neuronal lineages have become adapted to specific behavioral functions, but this has yet to be comprehensively evaluated."

Its metamorphic life history is advantageous because the great majority of central neurons arise during a second neurogenic period as the larva grows. During this postembryonic phase, each NB divides repeatedly, with the smaller product of each division being a ganglion mother cell (GMC), which then terminally divides to produce two neurons. By the start of metamorphosis each NB and its immature progeny form a discrete cell cluster from which one or two axon bundles project to specific regions in the larval neuropil (<a href=\"#bib60\">Truman et al., 2004</a>). Each axon bundle identifies the neurons of a hemilineage, a set of neuronal \u2018cousins\u2019 that includes either the \u2018A\u2019 (Notch-on) or \u2018B\u2019 (Notch-off) daughter from the GMC division (<a href=\"#bib59\">Truman et al., 2010</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, 25 of the 30 embryonic NBs in a hemisegment generate postembryonic lineage. Of the 50 possible hemilineages, 17 are removed by programmed cell death so that a segmental unit of the adult thoracic CNS contains neurons from only 33 hemilineage-based pools. These account for 90\u201395% of the neurons in the adult thoracic CNS. Hemilineages are also units for the early molecular diversity within the VNS. Expression of many early transcription factors is restricted along hemilineage lines (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lacin et al., 2014</a>) and many of these transcription factors have homologs involved in fate determination in the vertebrate spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thor and Thomas, 1997</a>). For example, the homeodomain protein Dbx1 controls the difference between the V0 and V1 fates in the mouse spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pierani et al., 2001</a>), while the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog, <i>dbx</i>, controls differentiation of particular VNS cell types through interactions with <i>even-skipped</i> and <i>hb9</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lacin et al., 2009</a>)."

We find that most hemilineages are composed of pools of similar interneurons, confirming that neuronal classes are indeed based on a hemilineage plan. Stimulation of interneurons in a hemilineage pool using the temperature-sensitive cation channel dTRPA1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hamada et al., 2008</a>) elicits a characteristic, often unique, behavioral response from each. The complexity of the elicited behavior reflects the complexity of the hemilineage's projection pattern and the neuropil region to which it projects. These findings suggest that the hemilineages provide a functional as well as an anatomical ground plan for the thoracic nervous system, and that thorax-mediated behaviors occur by combinations of simple movements elicited by relatively simple ventral hemilineages, which are then orchestrated by a hierarchy of increasingly complex dorsal hemilineages."

For example, hemilineages 1A and 1B are the respective A and B daughters of NB 1. We are using the postembryonic designations of the NBs (from <a href=\"#bib60\">Truman et al., 2004</a>) rather than their embryonic names (i.e., <a href=\"#bib48\">Schmid et al., 1999</a>) because there is controversy over the correspondence of the two maps (<a href=\"#bib4\">Birkholz et al., 2015</a>; Lacin and Truman, in preparation). Working with isolated hemilineages has been difficult because the members are cousins rather than sisters. Consequently, a clonal approach, such as MARCM (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lee and Luo, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yu et al., 2010a</a>), serves to mark the 2 daughters of the GMC division, but does not label all the neurons in one hemilineage at the exclusion of those in the other. Therefore, we devised approaches to mark the secondary neurons in a hemilineage and then track them through metamorphosis to assess their form and function in the adult. Of the 33 major thoracic hemilineages, hemilineages 0A, 4A, 16B and 17A are not addressed in this study."

The larval pattern was then maintained by using a transiently expressed recombinase to remove a transcriptional stop cassette from an Actin5C -FRT&gt;-stop-FRT&gt;-LexA::p65 transgene and thereby extending expression into the adult stage. The successful application of this strategy, though, required that the recombinase activity was limited to the larval growth period when the desired hemilineage pattern was expressed."

The results of the first method (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. In the last instar larva, line R24B02-GAL4 drives expression in the cells of hemilineage 12A from the subesophageal through the A1 segments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, this expression pattern wanes during metamorphosis and is replaced by a different set of cells in the adult CNS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To maintain lineage expression into the adult, we used R24B02-GAL4 to drive pJFRC180-20XUAS-IVS-Flp2::PEST, hereafter referred to as UAS-Flippase, to remove the transcriptional stop from an Actin5C-FRT&gt;-dSTOP-FRT&gt;-GAL4 construct. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, when combined with the reporter construct, pJFRC2-10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</a>), expression in the hemilineage 12A cells was maintained into the adult. A complication, though, was that expression was observed in other cells, presumably ones in which the stop cassette had been removed in earlier larval or embryonic stages, when this CRM drives a different expression pattern. To circumvent this early expression we used a GeneSwitch strategy (<a href=\"#bib40\">Osterwalder et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Roman et al., 2001</a>) in which we fused a <i>Drosophila</i> codon-optimized ligand-binding domain of the human progesterone receptor to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. R24B02-GeneSwitch should then drive expression only after larvae are treated with a progesterone mimic, such as RU486. As seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a> feeding larvae RU486 during the third instar resulted in strong expression of immature 12A interneurons. Removal of the drug at the start of metamorphosis was followed by a waning of GFP expression so that it was lost by adult emergence (<a href=\"#bib21\">Harris, 2012</a>). Feeding adults with RU486 reinduced GFP expression but only in the expected adult pattern and not in the 12A interneurons. Consequently, the RU486 given to feeding larvae is effectively cleared from the animal during metamorphosis (this study). We then used the R24B02-GeneSwitch line in conjunction with UAS-flippase, Actin5C-FRT&gt;-dSTOP-FRT&gt;-GAL4, and pJFRC2-10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP to reveal the adult morphology of the hemilineage 12A neurons. Without treatment with RU486 in the larva, we saw no GFP expression at any stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,F</a>), but feeding them with the drug during the third larval instar resulted in expression in the 12A interneurons that persisted through metamorphosis and continued to be robust in the adult (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). Importantly, this adult expression pattern did not also contain the adult-specific cells characteristic of R24B02 because the RU486 was cleared from the system before these cells started to express late in metamorphosis."

These two hemilineages cannot be readily distinguished in the larva (<a href=\"#bib60\">Truman et al., 2004</a>) and we were unable to differentiate them in our analysis. Consequently, they are considered as a single unit. An important diagnostic feature of each hemilineage is the neuroglian-positive tracts in which it runs. A detailed analysis of the larval-to-adult transformation of this tract system is described in Shepherd et al. (2015, in revision), so only a superficial treatment will be given here. The immortalized driver lines show the neuropil regions that are targets of a given hemilineage, but for the more complex hemilineages, that overlap either bilaterally or intersegmentally, a detailed analysis of the anatomy needs to be supplemented by a clonal approach that has been used sparingly here and will be dealt with in detail elsewhere (Shepherd, Sahota, Court, Harris, Truman and Williams, in preparation). The thoracic neuropil can be roughly divided into the paired, ventrolateral leg neuropils in each segment and a dorsal region, the tectulum (<a href=\"#bib45\">Power, 1943</a>), which has lost obvious segmental organization and is most expanded in the T2 region."

Decapitated flies maintain a good stance and show little spontaneous leg or wing movements except for occasional grooming bouts of the front legs or of the hind legs over the wings (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Cells in the respective hemilineages were excited using the temperature-sensitive TRPA1 channel expressed in the corresponding neurons and the decapitated flies subjected to a linear heat ramp and videos were acquired through the warming process for 45 to 55 s (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Decapitated flies lacking the TRPA1 effector show no response to the heat ramp, maintaining their posture with occasional bouts of grooming movements. The behavioral responses of the decapitated flies were divided into six behavioral categories. (1) <i>Changes in posture</i>: this category includes tonic changes in posture or in leg or joint position. (2) <i>Uncoordinated leg movements</i>: the flies showed phasic leg movements that had no obvious inter- or intrasegmental coordination. The decapitated flies typically stayed in place or, if they moved, their course was erratic. (3) <i>Walking:</i> this involved translocation of the animal over more than a body length during the test period. The movements could be forwards, sideways or backwards, but the trajectories were typically smooth. (4) <i>Wing waving</i>: this category includes bouts of low frequency wing movements such as wing extension, wing flicking, or wing scissoring. (5) <i>Wing buzzing:</i> these movements include high frequency wing movements that appeared as a blur on the 60 fps video frames. The wings could be extended laterally in the flight or singing positions or could remain over the back. During buzz episodes the decapitated fly might or might not become airborne. (6) <i>Takeoff</i>: these typically involved the decapitated fly launching into the air within one to two frames of the normal video (span of \u223c30\u201360 ms). In the lines in which this response was common, we used high-speed video to confirmed the role of the t2 legs in producing the takeoff jump."

The net movement is always forwards, although the trajectory turns due to uneven step sizes, as observed by <a href=\"#bib67\">Yellman et al. (1997)</a>.

Hemilineage 6A clusters are found in neuromeres S3 through A1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and form one of the dorsalmost arbors of the tectulum. The 6A clusters show an ipsilateral arbor that is largely confined to the segment of origin and a distal, contralateral arbor that converges from S3 through A1 into the T2 region of the tectulum (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). nSyt::GFP localizes to the lateral portions of the contralateral arbor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

The basic morphology is much the same in the adult (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>), as described in <a href=\"#bib9\">Brown and Truman (2009)</a>. The neurite projects dorsally, forming a bushy ipsilateral (proximal) arbor in the tectulum, then crosses the midline to form an ascending tract that extends through the neck connective (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>).

The hemilineage also makes symmetric ascending projections in the upper part of the dorsal neuropil. The T2 and T3 hemilineages send projections to T1, while the T1 hemilineage sends projections up the neck connective. A prominent component of the T3 lineage are the contralateral haltere interneurons (cHINs; <a href=\"#bib52\">Strausfeld and Seyan, 1985</a>), with their distinctive \u2018bowtie\u2019 arbor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5N,O</a>).

The lineage 11 neurons show a complex projection that is predominantly in T2 and largely confined to the tectulum neuropil (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>).

Consequently, we used teashirt-GAL80 (tsh-GAL80; <a href=\"#bib18\">Clyne and Miesenb\u00f6ck, 2008</a>) to suppress thoracic expression, but leaving expression in the descending interneurons (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These decapitated flies showed a severe reduction in the number of takeoffs when subjected to the heat ramp (9% of tsh-GAL80 flies [N = 22] vs 100% [N = 13] for R26B05-GAL4 flies lacking the tsh-GAL80)."

Hemilineage 12A arborizes throughout the dorsal tectulum neuropil.

The 19A neurons descend into the ipsilateral leg neuropil, while the 19B neurons project across the iP commissure and turn anteriorly. The adult morphology is similar. The 19A and 19B cell clusters remain in the posteriodorsal region of each segment. The 19A neurons project into the ipsilateral leg neuropil, where they form a major projection extending through lateral and ventral leg neuropil and a medial projection that extends to the midline. The medial projections in T1 and T2 converge on the midline in T2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>). nSyt::GFP localizes to the most medial (distal) part of the medial projection (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). The hemilineage 19B cluster in T1 is greatly reduced in the larva, and after metamorphosis the 19B cluster in T3 is also very small, presumably through cell death during metamorphosis. The adult T2 neurons make a robust projection across the iP commissure and arborize dorsally in the tectulum neuropil. The 19B neurons have both medial and lateral arbors that project anteriorly (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J,K</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Two motor hemilineages (15B and 24B) and fifteen interneuron hemilineages form the immature \u2018leg neuropil\u2019 of the larva (<a href=\"#bib60\">Truman et al., 2004</a>) and all of these make neurons exclusively for the adult leg neuropil.

On the sensory side, the dendrites of the above-mentioned 23B neurons and the neurons of the 9A group overlap the terminals of exteroceptors and proprioceptors, respectively (<a href=\"#bib21\">Harris, 2012</a>) and are likely involved with dealing with primary sensory input. More complex computations are likely carried out by the 14A interneurons. Their NB is the persisting NB4-1 NB from the embryo (<a href=\"#bib4\">Birkholz et al., 2015</a>), and the homologous NB4-1 in grasshoppers produces the cluster of midline spiking interneurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shepherd and Laurent, 1992</a>) that conveys information from the somatosensory map to the myotopic motor map (<a href=\"#bib13\">Burrows and Newland, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Burrows, 1996</a>). The neurons generated by NB 4-1 in flies are anatomically similar to the grasshopper neurons and we expect that the fly neurons are likewise involved in maintaining spatial information during the transformation from the sensory (<a href=\"#bib38\">Murphey et al., 1989</a>) to motor maps (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brierley et al., 2012</a>) in the leg. Outside of these spatially restricted leg hemilineages, other leg hemilineage clusters have a rather diffuse projection through the leg neuropil, as in the case of 3A and 4B, or they have arbors that also extend beyond their respective leg neuropil, such seen for the 1A and 19A neurons."

For some of the dorsal-projecting hemilineages the members in the cluster appear relatively homogeneous (e.g., 6A and 6B), as seen for most of the leg hemilineages. In other instances, though, such as the 12A and 8B groups, the hemilineage cluster is more complex and contains obvious subclasses of interneurons."

We speculate that the more homogenous hemilineages are collections of parallel components, which provide parallel but overlapping channels in the circuits that control sensory to motor transformations. The more heterogeneous hemilineages likely have more diversified integrative functions. The recent characterization of lineages in the fly brain (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ito et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yu et al., 2013</a>) shows many brain lineages that contain a greater diversity of cell types than we see for the VNS hemilineages. Nevertheless, some of the brain lineages also appear to be simple, rather homogeneous collections of neurons and we would expect these to also represent parallel processing units. This idea is supported by a projection neuron hemilineage from the lateral antennal lobe (lAL) NB. Overall, this hemilineage contains five classes of projection neurons but they are all involved in receiving primary sensory input (olfactory, gustatory, or primary antennal mechanosensory) and relaying it to higher centers within or around the mushroom bodies (<a href=\"#bib74\">Lin et al., 2012</a>)."

As summarized in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, most of our lines had some degree of contamination with expression in neurons that were outside of our target hemilineage. We did not use lines that showed expression in sensory neurons (such as hemilineages 3A and 19B), or that had expression in other hemilineage clusters (e.g., the hemilineage 14A line). We used lines that had expression in a few abdominal neurons per neuromere or weak expression in a few scattered thoracic neurons per neuromere. In all cases, the predominant expression in the line was from the target hemilineage. The problem of extraneous brain contamination was removed by decapitation, although we had concerns about severed descending axons that might still be activated by the heat ramp. Where this was a potential issue (i.e., presence of descending axons in the line) we circumvented the problem by ageing the animals for 24 hr after the decapitation to allow the severed axons to degenerate prior to behavior testing, or by blocking thoracic expression using tsh-GAL80 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and showing that the behavioral response disappeared.

Tonic responses were the more common and are defined as a persistent behavioral response that began at some point during the heat ramp and were then maintained for the remainder of the stimulus. This type of response was seen for changes in posture (such as seen for hemilineages 9A or 13B) for sustained walking (as for the 1A or the 10B neurons), and for sustained wing buzzing (the 2A interneurons). The less common pattern was for the decapitated flies to display an ordered sequence of behavioral responses that changed as the temperature increased. This was very evident for the stimulation of the 12A neurons that began with locomotion that was later joined by lateral wing waving and then finally by the onset of sustained wing buzzing. This behavioral sequencing might result from a progressive increase in neuronal firing rate of the cells in the group during the heat ramp, or by the successive recruitment of group members with higher firing thresholds. We have no data to favor either option at present."

This response consistency was confined to some of the hemilineage groups that evoked postural changes. We do not have detailed transmitter information for all of the hemilineage groups but we do know that the 9A and 5B clusters are GABA-immunopositive neurons (<a href=\"#bib21\">Harris, 2012</a>). Therefore, the stereotypy resulting from their activation may be due to imposing inhibition at a particular level of sensory-motor integration. The hemilineages that evoked more complex behaviors typically showed a range of behaviors, although there was usually a dominant category of response that characterized that particular hemilineage group. Therefore, for these more complex behaviors, the response to hemilineage group stimulation was probabilistic rather than deterministic, in that the activity of these neurons enhanced the probability that a particular behavior would be performed. A similar phenomenon was seen in the behavioral responses of larval <i>Drosophila</i> to TRPA1 activation of different sparse sets of central neurons (<a href=\"#bib61\">Vogelstein et al., 2014</a>). The larval behavioral responses also tended to be probabilistic in that a given set of neurons enhanced the probability of a behavioral response but their activity did not invariably lead to this response.

Not surprisingly, the hemilineage groups that evoke changes in leg posture have their arbors concentrated in the leg neuropils. Most are confined to the leg neuropil except for the 3B interneurons, that have major projections into the tectulum and also evoke wing movements, and the 5B neurons, that are potentially GABAergic and may have a general suppressive function. Hemilineages that evoke coordinated or uncoordinated leg movements similarly have a strong leg neuropil component but their arbors also project into the medial neuropil and into the tectulum neuropil. Strong projections into the tectulum neuropil were also evident for all of the hemilineages that evoked wing movements of either low or high frequency. Two of the three hemilineages that evoked frequent takeoff had a strong projection into the T2 leg neuropil (the site of the jump motoneurons) in addition to their extensive arbor in the tectulum. Curiously, the third takeoff lineage, lineage 11A/B, lacked a T2 arbor but had substantial projections into the T1 and T3 leg neuropils. Overall the anatomy of the hemilineages conformed to the generally held idea that the leg neuropils deal with leg function while the tectulum neuropil is involved with wing-related behavior such as singing or flight. In addition, though, the tectulum and dorsomedial neuropil may be generally involved in complex, coordinated behavior in the thorax. Hemilineages, such as 1A and 10B, that evoke walking behavior but little in the way of wing movement nevertheless have arbor extension into the dorsomedial neuropil and tectulum, suggesting that these regions may be generally involved in the coordination of complex thoracic behavior regardless of whether it involves legs or wings."

During the course of stimulation of the 12A interneurons the decapitated flies showed a range of behaviors, some of which mimicked the movements displayed during courtship singing, but these soon degenerated into generalized wing vibration movements. We would expect that in the more complex dorsal hemilineages there might be specializations of function within the cluster and that the stimulation of all of the neurons at once might set up conflict states that might be hard to interpret. The specialization of the function of the vPR6 neurons suggest that some neurons within a hemilineage can be adapted for specialized behaviors that are, nevertheless, related to the basic function of the hemilineage as a whole."

Not only have the NBs been highly conserved, but their early neuronal progeny are also highly conserved as first elegantly shown by <a href=\"#bib54\">Thomas et al. (1984)</a>. These early-born cells are the \u2018primary\u2019 neurons and their identities are determined by birth-order as encoded in a transcription factor progression within the cycling NB (<a href=\"#bib22\">Isshiki et al., 2001</a>). Many of these early-born cells serve a pioneer function, which explains the stereotyped pattern of tracts and commissures seen in the ventral neuropil throughout the insects (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thomas et al., 1984</a>). The later-born \u2018secondary\u2019 neurons are born after the NB starts to express grainyhead (<a href=\"#bib2\">Almeida and Bray, 2005</a>) and include late-born embryonic neurons as well as all of the neurons that are born during postembryonic life (see <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>; for a discussion of primary vs secondary neurons). As summarized in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, the hemilineage units of these secondary neurons typically include neurons of related phenotypes that may participate in functionally related components of behavior. The interesting question is whether these cell classes are likewise conserved across the insects? Conservation in class character in widely different groups is well illustrated by the medial lineage. In grasshoppers the A hemilineage cells are GABAergic, engrailed-positive local interneurons and the B hemilineage cells are engrailed-negative, projection cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jia and Siegler, 2002</a>), and the same is true in <i>Drosophila</i> (JW Truman, unpublished). Similarly, a comparative analysis of the clusters of GABA-immunoreactive neurons in the VNS of diverse insects (<a href=\"#bib66\">Witten and Truman, 1998</a>) supports the contention that the properties of neurons in homologous hemilineages are highly conserved across much of the insects. Although one can homologize cell classes of secondary neurons across most of the insects, we think that it is unlikely that one could homologize individual neurons within a particular class."

                                "text": "This then brings us to the question of the conservation of function for the neurons of the various hemilineage classes. In grasshoppers ventral interneurons that run in the transverse tract receive input from wing afferents (<a href=\"#bib65\">Watson and Burrows, 1983</a>) while in flies the 2A interneurons are the main neurons of the transverse tract and they can drive flight behavior. For the leg hemilineages, NB4-1 and NB3-1 in grasshopper make the medial and anteromedial spiking interneurons, respectively, of the leg circuit (<a href=\"#bib12\">Burrows, 1996</a>), while in flies the homologous NBs (<a href=\"#bib60\">Truman et al., 2004</a>) generate the 14A and 4B interneurons which are similar appearing local interneurons in the leg neuropil. Whether the functions of the neurons are exactly the same in the two species are as of yet unknown, but their involvement in leg function is clearly conserved. We expect that the functional roles of most of all of the hemilineages to be highly conserved through much of insect evolution. For the simpler hemilineages that contain units that work in parallel, addition or reductions in the number of neurons could enhance or reduce functionality by altering the spatial or temporal resolution of their level of the computational network. Another benefit of an increase in numbers of an interneuron type could be to provide a finer control over the speed of locomotion , as seen for the control of swimming speed in larval zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib35\">McLean et al., 2008</a>) in which the increase in speed involves the recruitment of new interneurons and the repression of interneurons active at the slower speed. For higher level, more complex hemilineages, changes in neuronal properties/connectivity rather than numbers might be more important for generating behavioral changes."

For the thoracic segments it provides a reference to which information from other insects can be compared. It is important to remember, though, that the flight system of <i>Drosophila</i>, with its mesothoracic wings and metathoracic halteres, is a highly derived system compared with more basal insect groups. Also, in the fly about a third of the thoracic hemilineages die leaving few if any members (<a href=\"#bib59\">Truman et al., 2010</a>). Consequently, some cell types that may have been important in the ancestral nervous system have been lost with the evolution of <i>Drosophila</i>'s derived pattern of flight. The other important caveat is that our analysis includes only the postembryonic secondary neurons, and so we are lacking access to the embryonic-born neurons, a small but extremely important component of the adult CNS."

At this point in time we do not know. However, a thoracic unit of the fly thoracic nervous system has about 2500 pairs of neurons, most of which can be assigned to 33 hemilineage units. For many (most?) of the hemilineages one may be able to distill the functional essence of each unit down to one or two sets of cellular characteristics that may reflect the ancestral roles of these cells before the neuronal numbers were expanded. This would then provide us with a basic \u2018tool-kit\u2019 of neuron types that insects have used to construct their VNS. These features and the knowledge of the other units on which they preferably synapse may allow us to hypothesize an ancestral wiring diagram for a primitive insect/arthropod VNS. With such a wiring diagram in hand we would then be better able to look for functional homologies in a primitive vertebrate spinal cord such as the lamprey."

Although the MARCM clone analysis was started by Dr. Harris, it was substantially expanded and carried to completing after her death. Consequently, we think it should be a separate paper. For the purpose of the present paper, our first concern was that we were getting the members of one hemilineage but none of the members of its sister hemilineage. We met this goal in all cases. Supplemental file 1 documents the amount of non-hemilineage contamination for each line. We accepted lines that had some scattered weak expressing cells in the thorax. We were more tolerant of accepting expression in abdominal interneurons. Lines with prominent sensory expression were not used. As described in the text, we also controlled for the effects of descending axons when such were present."
