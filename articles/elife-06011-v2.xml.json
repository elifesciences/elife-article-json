Using gene disruption in the mouse, we discovered a function for a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor PDZ-RhoGEF (<i>Arhgef11</i>) in white adipose tissue biology. While PDZ-RhoGEF was dispensable for a number of RhoA signaling-mediated processes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, including stress fiber formation and cell migration, it's deletion led to a reduction in their proliferative potential. On a whole organism level, PDZ-RhoGEF deletion resulted in an acute increase in energy expenditure, selectively impaired early adipose tissue development and decreased adiposity in adults. PDZ-RhoGEF-deficient mice were protected from diet-induced obesity and T2D. Mechanistically, PDZ-RhoGEF enhanced insulin/IGF-1 signaling in adipose tissue by controlling ROCK-dependent phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Our results demonstrate that PDZ-RhoGEF acts as a key determinant of mammalian metabolism and obesity-associated pathologies."

Using gene disruption in the mouse, we discovered a function for a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor PDZ-RhoGEF (<i>Arhgef11</i>) in white adipose tissue biology. While PDZ-RhoGEF was dispensable for a number of RhoA signaling-mediated processes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, including stress fiber formation and cell migration, it's deletion led to a reduction in their proliferative potential. On a whole organism level, PDZ-RhoGEF deletion resulted in an acute increase in energy expenditure, selectively impaired early adipose tissue development and decreased adiposity in adults. PDZ-RhoGEF-deficient mice were protected from diet-induced obesity and T2D. Mechanistically, PDZ-RhoGEF enhanced insulin/IGF-1 signaling in adipose tissue by controlling ROCK-dependent phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Our results demonstrate that PDZ-RhoGEF acts as a key determinant of mammalian metabolism and obesity-associated pathologies."

The mutant mice on the same diet, however, stayed thin and avoided these health issues. The experiments show that PDZ-RhoGEF helps relay insulin\u2019s message within the body, and as such it plays a critical role in regulating metabolism, sugar levels and fat accumulation. Future work should ask how PDZ-RhoGEF affects other complications linked to obesity, and explore the possibility of developing treatments for obesity based on the biology of this molecule."

While it is generally recognized that obesity arises as a result of a complex interplay of genetic factors that govern predisposition for white adipose tissue expansion, as well as environmental factors, such as diet, the molecular mechanisms underlying this condition are not fully understood. Adipose tissue growth results from an increase in both adipocyte size and number and occurs as part of normal development, as well as during the onset of obesity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Faust et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Prins and O'Rahilly, 1997</a>). Recent evidence shows that the number of adipocytes is set during childhood and adolescence and determines the adult fat mass (<a href=\"#bib54\">Spalding et al., 2008</a>). Adipogenesis, a differentiation program that gives rise to adipocytes, is regulated by a coordinated activation of a transcription factor network responding to the adipogenic and anti-adipogenic signals (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cristancho and Lazar, 2011</a>). Insulin/IGF-1 signaling also has marked effects on adipogenesis. For instance, genetic disruption of the insulin receptor (IR), the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) genes, as well as PKB\u03b1/Akt1 and PKB\u03b2/Akt2, respectively, the major mediators of insulin signaling, lead to impaired adipogenesis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Miki et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tseng et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yun et al., 2008</a>)."

RhoA-ROCK signaling is activated in mature adipocytes via mechanical stretch generated by obesity-related adipocyte hypertrophy (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hara et al., 2011</a>). Together with Rac and Cdc42, RhoA constitutes a Rho branch of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which act in a variety of signaling pathways and regulate many cellular functions (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ridley, 2001a</a>). Initially identified as key regulators of actin cytoskeleton remodeling, Rho family members control many other cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking, cell cycle progression, cytokinesis, migration, apoptosis, gene transcription, and cell fate determination (<a href=\"#bib8\">Coleman and Olson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">McBeath et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sordella et al., 2002</a>)."

Dbl family members contain at least one highly conserved Dbl homology (DH) catalytic domain, which facilitates the GDP/GTP exchange, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain N-terminal to the DH domain (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zheng, 2001</a>). PDZ-RhoGEF (ARHGEF11), encodes a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, with two transcript variants ARHGEF11 variant 1 and variant 2 in the human (GeneBank accession # NM_014784 and NM_198236) and a single Arhgef11 transcript in the mouse (Genebank accession NM_001003912). Together with two other Dbl family members, the leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) and p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF constitutes a newly identified subfamily, the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain-containing RhoGEFs (RGS-RhoGEFs)."

Another nsSNP coding for the R1467H (Arg1467His), a C-terminal variant of PDZ-RhoGEF was found in association with insulin resistance and type II diabetes in several populations, including Pima Indians, Old Order Amish, Caucasian, Korean and Chinese (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bottcher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Liu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ma et al., 2007</a>).

While our data show that PDZ-RhoGEF is dispensable for many cellular processes that it had previously been linked to, we discovered its direct involvement in controlling adipose tissue homeostasis through regulation of adipocyte numbers and energy expenditure. Mechanistically, PDZ-RhoGEF was found to induce RhoA/ROCK-dependent phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and promote signaling via this adaptor protein in response to insulin/IGF-1, controlling proliferation of adipogenic precursors and MEFs and whole body energy expenditure. Moreover, PDZ-RhoGEF-knockout (KO) mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in vivo. Our work firmly implicates PDZ-RhoGEF in the physiological control of adipose tissue development, obesity and insulin resistance."

Judged by BrdU incorporation, deletion of PDZ-RhoGEF led to a reduction of proliferative capacity in cultured adipogenic progenitors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). To probe the proliferative capacity of the adipose tissue in vivo during neonatal development, wild type and PDZ-RhoGEF KO postnatal day 6.5 mice were injected with BrdU at 12\u2009hr intervals for 3.5 days. At one-month of age, mice were sacrificed and the BrdU-retaining cells in the adipose tissue counted. PDZ-RhoGEF KO EWAT displayed fewer BrdU-retainingcells than the wild type EWAT, indicative of impaired proliferation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Of note, EWAT from both genotypes displayed the same proportion of infiltrating macrophages, determined by staining for the macrophage marker F4/80 (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>), eliminating the possibility that the differences in the BrdU signal arose from variable infiltrates.

PDZ-RhoGEF KO MEFs, as well as the cultured FACS-sorted adipogenic progenitor cells, exhibited markedly lower PKB/Akt activation in response to IGF-1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Re-expression of PDZ-RhoGEF in the PDZ-RhoGEF-deficient MEFs rescued the IGF-1-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). However, activation-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor was comparable between the two genotypes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), indicating that diminution of PKB/Akt phosphorylation in PDZ-RhoGEF KO MEFs stems from an impaired PDZ-RhoGEF-dependent step downstream of the receptor. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) acts immediately downstream of the insulin/IGF-1 receptors to propagate their signals (<a href=\"#bib58\">Taniguchi et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, IRS-1 S632/635 have been implicated as substrates of ROCKI/II (<a href=\"#bib21\">Furukawa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2009</a>). In IGF-1-stimulated PDZ-RhoGEF KO MEFs, both tyrosine and IRS1 serine 632/635 (S632/635) phosphorylation were greatly reduced compared to wild type MEFs, as was its direct association with the p85\u03b1 and p110\u03b1 subunits of PI3K (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). In contrast, phosphorylation of IRS-1 at S612, another putative Rho kinase (ROCKI/II) targeted residue (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sordella et al., 2003</a>), was not affected by PDZ-RhoGEF loss (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), indicating that phosphorylation of this residue in MEFs can be uncoupled from that of S632/635. When wild type MEFs were pretreated with Y27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCKI and ROCKII, IGF-1-dependent PKB/Akt phosphorylation was reduced to a level comparable to that found in PDZ-RhoGEF KO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), suggesting that these kinases mediate the PDZ-RhoGEF-dependent IGF-1 response. Thus, PDZ-RhoGEF modulates IGF-1-mediated cell proliferation in MEFs via regulation of ROCK-dependent phosphorylation of IRS-1 at S632/635."

Upon IP injection of insulin, activation-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) was comparable between wild type and PDZ-RhoGEF KO EWAT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). However, activation of PKB/Akt in EWAT from PDZ-RhoGEF KO animals was considerably reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), consistent with a role for PDZ-RhoGEF in the transmission of the insulin signal downstream of IR and reminiscent of the MEFs response to IGF-1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,E</a>). Further, both tyrosine and S632/635 phosphorylation of IRS-1 in PDZ-RhoGEF KO EWAT were decreased in response to insulin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), as was the direct association of IRS-1 with the p85\u03b1 and p110\u03b1 subunits of PI3K (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), indicative of impeded insulin signaling throughput via IRS-1 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Furukawa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2009</a>). In accordance with the MEF data, phosphorylation of S612 of IRS1 remained similar between the genotypes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Of note, PDZ-RhoGEF loss did not affect insulin-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation in two other peripheral insulin target tissues, the liver (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), where PDZ-RhoGEF is abundant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), or the skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), where PDZ-RhoGEF expression is relatively low (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Under HFD, phosphorylation of IRS1 S632/635 and S307, targets of c-Jun N-terminus kinase 1 (JNK1) and mTOR/S6K1, were elevated in wild type EWAT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). While JNK1 activation appeared unaffected by PDZ-RhoGEF deletion, p70S6K1 activation was considerably higher in wild type EWAT under HFD (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Even on normal food, insulin-mediated p70S6K1 activation was reduced in PDZ-RhoGEF KO EWAT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Intriguingly, prolonged HFD not only aggravated the activation of p70S6K signaling but also led to an elevation of PDZ-RhoGEF protein levels in all peripheral insulin-targeted tissues, EWAT, skeletal muscle (EDL), and liver (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), suggesting that high levels of PDZ-RhoGEF accompany HFD-induced insulin resistance in wild type animals."

While such complexity leads to functional redundancy in the case of certain signals, various regulatory inputs display differential specificity toward particular Rho family members and act in a context-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib16\">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ridley, 2001a</a>). PDZ-RhoGEF was initially identified as an activator of RhoA acting downstream of GPCRs through association with G\u03b112 or G\u03b113 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fukuhara et al., 1999</a>), and subsequently found as a component of other signaling pathways implicated in cell migration, axon outgrowth, and chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Driessens et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kuner et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Perrot et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zheng et al., 2006</a>). Accumulating evidence indicates that PDZ-RhoGEF, LARG and p115RhoGEF transmit a partially overlapping set of signals to RhoA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chikumi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mikelis et al., 2013</a>). With its restricted expression in the hematopoietic system, p115RhoGEF was found to be required for marginal zone B cell and leukocyte homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Francis et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Girkontaite et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wirth et al., 2008</a>), whereas LARG plays a major role in maintaining the G<sub>12</sub>-G<sub>13</sub>\u2013mediated vascular smooth muscle tone during the development of salt-dependent hypertension, consistent with its predominant expression in the aorta media (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wirth et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, PDZ-RhoGEF, p115RhoGEF and LARG also display overlapping roles in linking G<sub>\u03b112/13</sub>-coupled GPCRs to RhoA activation, cell migration, and thrombin-mediated cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mikelis et al., 2013</a>). Using genetic disruption in the mouse, we have shown that PDZ-RhoGEF is dispensable for embryo development and a number of known RhoA signaling-mediated processes, including stress fiber formation and cell migration in fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ridley, 2001b</a>). Nevertheless, PDZ-RhoGEF has a prominent function in modulating insulin signaling in mouse adipose tissue, with profound effects on whole body physiology, including development of obesity and obesity-associated T2D."

Consistent with our results, ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of IRS-1 at S632/635 was previously found to promote signaling throughput via IRS-1 and increased glucose uptake in adipocytes and mouse skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#bib21\">Furukawa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2009</a>). The uncoupling of IRS-1 S632/635 and S612 phosphorylation in MEFs and EWAT upon disruption of PDZ-RhoGEF may represent an additional means of achieving specificity in RhoA signaling. Intriguingly, PDZ-RhoGEF appears capable of directing ROCK activity towards IRS-1 S632/635 in fibroblasts and adipose tissue, whereas other GEFs may participate in modulating its activity towards S612 in other tissues. Alternatively, the distinct RhoGEFs may differentially activate ROCK family members (ROCK1/\u03b2 and ROCKII/\u03b1), which in turn may harbor subtle, but important differences in specificity towards IRS-1."

Nevertheless, PDZ-RhoGEF deletion increased total oxygen consumption and total activity, largely due to an increase in the stereotype activity, but not the ambulatory activity. RER analysis indicates that while both wild type and PDZ-RhoGEF KO mice utilize carbohydrates and fat as fuel (0.8<rer<1.0), (<a=\"\" a=\"\" activity=\"\" an=\"\" and=\"\" as=\"\" carbohydrates=\"\" contractility-mediated=\"\" exercise-=\"\" found=\"\" fuel=\"\" glucose=\"\" higher=\"\" href=\"#bib45\" impact=\"\" in=\"\" increase=\"\" indeed,=\"\" ko=\"\" may=\"\" mice=\"\" muscle=\"\" muscles.=\"\" of=\"\" pdz-rhogef=\"\" physical=\"\" preferential=\"\" rer=\"\" skeletal=\"\" source=\"\" suggest=\"\" the=\"\" their=\"\" transport=\"\" use=\"\" values=\"\">Richter and Hargreaves, 2013</rer<1.0),>) and in turn increase the use of carbohydrates as energy source. Remarkably, despite its reduced PI3K pathway activation in response to insulin, PDZ-RhoGEF KO EWAT displayed an increase in ECAR, revealing of the preferential use of glucose as an energy source in this tissue. This may in part be due to the compensatory, PI3K-independent mechanisms for glucose utilization in EWAT (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2007</a>) and contribute to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis in PDZ-RhoGEF KO animals and their lean and metabolically healthy phenotype."

                                "text": "The phenotype of PDZ-RhoGEF-deficient mice partially resembles that of mice lacking other insulin signaling pathway components. For instance, IRS-1- or PKB\u03b1/Akt1-deficiency leads to decreased body fat (<a href=\"#bib40\">Miki et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wan et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, adipose tissue-specific disruption of the insulin receptor (FIRKO) displayed reduced adiposity. Unlike the proliferative defect found in PDZ-RhoGEF KO adipose tissue development, the reduced adipose tissue size in FIRKO mice results from decreases in adipocyte size in the mutant adult fat pads (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bluher et al., 2002</a>). Further confounding the comparison between the phenotypes arising from IR and PDZ-RhoGEF deletion is the contribution of PDZ-RhoGEF to signaling via the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). IGF-1R is the dominant IR/IGF-1R family member expressed in the stromal-vascular cells of the developing adipose tissue, including progenitor cells and pre-adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Entingh-Pearsall and Kahn, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nougues et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wright and Hausman, 1995</a>). Thus, in vivo, PDZ-RhoGEF impact on the proliferative capacity of adipogenic precursors likely relates to its function in signaling via the related IGF-1R, whereas in mature adipose tissue it may also affect IR signaling (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Notably, dual deletion of IGF-1 and insulin receptors in adipose tissues (FIGIRKO) results in reduced adiposity due to a decrease in adipocyte abundance (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boucher et al., 2012</a>). Taken together, the correlation between full body deletion of PDZ-RhoGEF and deletion of IR/IGF-1R in adipose tissue further reinforces that modification of IR/IGF-1R signaling in adipose tissue plays a central role in controlling adipose tissue homeostasis. A mechanistic insight into the contribution of PDZ-RhoGEF-mediated control of energy expenditure and adipocyte numbers to reduced adiposity may require tissue-specific deletion of PDZ-RhoGEF in various mouse tissues."

Of note, PDZ-RhoGEF may also act on mature adipocytes or other cell types to influence adipose tissue development and homeostasis. Adipocyte number is a key determinant of fat mass in humans, whereby individuals with higher number of adipocytes are prone to obesity (<a href=\"#bib54\">Spalding et al., 2008</a>). Likewise, wild type mice, which displayed greater total adipocyte numbers, became obese and developed T2D when on prolonged HFD. Reduced adipose tissue expansion in PDZ-RhoGEF KO animals prevented these pathological consequences of the HFD. Of interest, under conditions of energy overload, PDZ-RhoGEF levels were elevated in the peripheral insulin-target tissues and accompanied by increased downstream signaling to p70S6K1 and enhanced negative feedback loop input into the insulin/insulin receptor signaling cascade(<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013II</a>)."

Cells were monitored for a 24 hr period, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. For transwell assay, MEFs in a serum-free medium were plated onto the upper chamber of transwell plares (Corning, New York), and IGF-1 (100 ng/ml), and was added to the lower chamber. After 6 hr, the cells from the inside of chamber were removed with cotton swab and the cells on the bottom of the filter were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and cells stained with 2 \u03bcg/ml DAPI in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS.

MEFs were plated onto glass converslips and grown to confluence. 15 hr after induction of differentiation, cells were pulse-labeled for 3 hr with BrdU (10 mM) and then transferred to BrdU-free induction medium. 72-hr later, cells were fixed and BrdU positive cells were detected by phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-BrdU antibody (Molecular Probe, Invitrogen) and counter stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). For in vitro differentiation, post-confluent cells were maintained in induction medium for 2 days, and then were fed with complete medium supplement with 5 mg/ml of insulin every other day. At the end of the monitoring period (day 8), cells were fixed with 10% phosphate buffered formalin. Oil droplets were stained with Oil Red-O as described (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tang et al., 2003</a>). Relative lipid content was determined by absorbance at 510 nm by spectrophotometer (Beckman/Coulter, DU800). Post-confluent ADSCs were stimulated with insulin (5 ng/ml) and DNA synthesis was assessed by [3H]-thymidine incorporation at each indicated time point. The number of mature adipocytes derived from MEFs was averaged of three independent fields after Oil Red-O staining (n\u00a0=\u00a03-\u20134)."

What is the oxygen consumption rate in the fat pads? What about glucose use in the liver? It is also not convincing that the mice have any difference in energy expenditure, as the mice have little increase in oxygen consumption (only one time point is statistically significant) and no significant change in locomotor activity (despite some small trends with high p-values)."

More metabolic analyses should be performed in these tissues, as the reduced adiposity may not be the major factor accounting for improved insulin sensitivity. Although fat accumulation in the liver may be a consequence of the changes in the fat, this may not necessarily be the case. It is hard to make any conclusions because there is not much studied in the livers regarding their metabolism. It is also unclear how glucose uptake is being altered in the EDL since PDZ-RhoGEF is not detected in this tissue (unless the levels are increased after HFD?) \u2013 this suggests there may be crosstalk occurring, which should be acknowledged in the manuscript."
