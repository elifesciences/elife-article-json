In the <i>Drosophila</i> ovary, two separate niches control germ line stem cell (GSC) self-renewal and differentiation processes. Compared to the self-renewing niche, relatively little is known about the maintenance and function of the differentiation niche. In this study, we show that the cellular redox state regulated by Wnt signaling is critical for the maintenance and function of the differentiation niche to promote GSC progeny differentiation. Defective Wnt signaling causes the loss of the differentiation niche and the upregulated BMP signaling in differentiated GSC progeny, thereby disrupting germ cell differentiation. Mechanistically, Wnt signaling controls the expression of multiple <i>glutathione-S-transferase</i> family genes and the cellular redox state. Finally, <i>Wnt2</i> and <i>Wnt4</i> function redundantly to maintain active Wnt signaling in the differentiation niche. Therefore, this study has revealed a novel strategy for Wnt signaling in regulating the cellular redox state and maintaining the differentiation niche."

In the <i>Drosophila</i> ovary, two separate niches control germ line stem cell (GSC) self-renewal and differentiation processes. Compared to the self-renewing niche, relatively little is known about the maintenance and function of the differentiation niche. In this study, we show that the cellular redox state regulated by Wnt signaling is critical for the maintenance and function of the differentiation niche to promote GSC progeny differentiation. Defective Wnt signaling causes the loss of the differentiation niche and the upregulated BMP signaling in differentiated GSC progeny, thereby disrupting germ cell differentiation. Mechanistically, Wnt signaling controls the expression of multiple <i>glutathione-S-transferase</i> family genes and the cellular redox state. Finally, <i>Wnt2</i> and <i>Wnt4</i> function redundantly to maintain active Wnt signaling in the differentiation niche. Therefore, this study has revealed a novel strategy for Wnt signaling in regulating the cellular redox state and maintaining the differentiation niche."

This daughter cell then moves into another niche called the \u2018differentiation\u2019 niche and undergoes a series of divisions that produce the egg cells. The differentiation niche is formed by escort cells and is crucial for producing the egg cells, but it is not clear how the escort cells promote this process, or how the niche is maintained."

The self-renewal property is controlled in various stem cell systems by interplays between signals from the niche and intrinsic factors (<a href=\"#bib19\">Li and Xie, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Losick et al., 2011</a>). Germ line stem cells (GSCs) in the <i>Drosophila</i> ovary and testis are attractive systems for studying stem cell self-renewal at the molecular and cellular level (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fuller and Spradling, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Xie, 2013</a>). Although stem cell differentiation was widely thought to be a developmentally default state, we have recently proposed that GSC lineage differentiation is also controlled extrinsically by a differentiation niche formed by inner germarial sheath cells (ISCs, also known as escort cells). However, it remains unclear how the maintenance and function of the differentiation niche are regulated at the molecular level. In this study, we show that autocrine Wnt2/4 signaling maintains the differentiation niche by regulating ISC proliferation and survival via redox regulation."

The CBs further divide four times synchronously with incomplete cytokinesis to form 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, or 16-cell cysts (<a href=\"#bib4\">de Cuevas et al., 1997</a>). GSCs and their differentiated progeny can be reliably identified by their unique morphology of germ line-specific intracellular organelles known as fusomes: GSCs and CBs contain a spherical fusome known as the spectrosome, whereas differentiated germ cell cysts contain a branched fusome (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lin et al., 1994</a>). GSCs can be reliably distinguished from CBs by their direct contact with cap cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Cap cells function as the self-renewing niche to maintain GSCs by activating BMP signaling and maintaining E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion (<a href=\"#bib39\">Song et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Xie and Spradling, 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2000</a>). In addition, various classes of intrinsic factors work with BMP signaling and E-cadherin to control GSC self-renewal (<a href=\"#bib42\">Xie, 2013</a>). Therefore, GSC self-renewal is controlled by coordinated functions of niche-initiated signaling pathways and intrinsic factors."

Our recent study suggests ISCs and their associate long cellular processes act as the differentiation niche to promote GSC progeny differentiation in the <i>Drosophila</i> ovary because disrupting long ISC processes leads to an accumulation of CB-like cells, indicative of a germ cell differentiation defect (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kirilly et al., 2011</a>).

In addition, Rho signaling is also required in ISCs to promote GSC differentiation partly by repressing <i>dally</i> and <i>dpp</i> expression. <i>dally</i> encodes a proteoglycan protein, which is capable of promoting Dpp/BMP diffusion to the differentiation niche (<a href=\"#bib9\">Guo and Wang, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hayashi et al., 2009</a>). Ecdysteroid signaling also operates in ISCs to promote germ cell differentiation because inactivating ecdysteroid receptors EcR and Usp in ISCs disrupts cyst formation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Morris and Spradling, 2012</a>). One potential mechanism is that ecdysteroid signaling controls the formation of ISC cellular processes, thereby promoting the interaction between ISCs and germ cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Konig and Shcherbata, 2015</a>). Gap junction protein Inx2 functions in ISCs to promote germ cell differentiation, but its transmitted substances between ISCs and germ cells remain identified (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mukai et al., 2011</a>). The importance of gap junctions between ISCs and germ cells could also explain why ISC cellular processes are important for germ cell differentiation. Therefore, physical interactions and signaling-mediated communications between ISC cellular processes and GSC progeny likely contribute to GSC progeny differentiation collectively."

It also argues that Wnt4 activates Wnt signaling to maintain Piwi expression and repress E-cadherin expression in ISCs, thereby promoting germ cell differentiation. In contrast, this study has demonstrated that both ISC-expressing Wnt2 and Wnt4, but not Wnt4 alone, act through known Wnt pathway components to maintain active Wnt signaling, promoting germ cell differentiation. More importantly, we show that Wnt signaling is required to maintain ISCs by promoting ISC survival and proliferation. Surprisingly, Wnt signaling is dispensable for Piwi expression. Instead, we demonstrate that Wnt signaling controls the expression of four <i>Gst</i> genes to maintain the reduced redox, thereby promoting ISC maintenance and germ cell differentiation. Finally, knocking down one of the <i>Gst</i> gene, <i>GstD2</i>, in ISCs leads to the germ cell differentiation defect. Therefore, our study has revealed a novel mechanism which autocrine Wnt signaling utilizes to maintain ISCs and promote germ cell differentiation."

To facilitate the identification of GSCs and differentiated germ cells, spectrosomes and fusomes are labeled by Hts staining (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lin et al., 1994</a>), and germ cells are visualized by Vasa staining (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lasko and Ashburner, 1988</a>). In contrast to the control germarium containing 0 to 2 CBs, knocking down Wnt downstream genes <i>armadillo</i> (<i>arm</i>) and <i>disheveled</i> (<i>dsh</i>) in ISCs leads to an accumulation of many spectrosome-containing CBs (collectively referred to single germ cells at least one cell diameter away from cap cells) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Based on the fact that control germaria rarely contain three CBs, the germaria containing four or more CBs are considered to exhibit a germ cell differentiation defect. Over 90% of <i>arm</i> and <i>dsh</i> knockdown germaria (<i>armKD1</i> and <i>dshKD1</i>) exhibit the germ cell differentiation defect (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Similarly, <i>c587</i>-driven expression of the RNAi lines against different <i>arm</i> or <i>dsh</i> sequences (<i>armKD2</i> and <i>dshKD2</i>) also generates the similar germ cell differentiation defect (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, Wnt ligands bind the receptor complex composed of Frizzled (Fz), Frizzled 2 (Fz2) and Arrow to activate Dsh and stabilize Arm, which forms a protein complex with a TCF (T Cell Factor)-like Pangolin in the nucleus to activate target gene expression, whereas Axin (Axn) and Shaggy (Sgg) negatively modulate Wnt signaling by promoting Arm degradation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Logan and Nusse, 2004</a>). Simultaneous knockdown down of both <i>fz</i> and <i>fz2</i> (<i>fzKD+fz2KD</i>) in ISCs recapitulate the germ cell differentiation defect caused by either <i>armKD</i> or <i>dshKD</i>, although either <i>fzKD</i> or <i>fz2KD</i> yields a much weaker germ cell differentiation defect (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistently, overexpression of <i>axn</i> and <i>sgg</i> in ISCs also leads to the germ cell differentiation defect similar to that caused by <i>armKD</i> and <i>dshKD</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,G,H</a>).

Piwi protein shows comparable expression levels among the examined 203 control ISCs, 48 <i>armKD1</i> ISCs, 58 <i>armKD2</i> ISCs, and 46 <i>dshKD2</i> ISCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>).

Rho, Eggless, Woc, Lsd1, Piwi, EGFR signaling, and ecdysone signaling have been shown to be required in ISCs to maintain long ISC cellular processes encasing germ cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schultz et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kirilly et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Eliazer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ma et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Maimon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Konig and Shcherbata, 2015</a>). Since properly differentiated germ cells are also required to maintain long ISC cellular processes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kirilly et al., 2011</a>), it is difficult to distinguish the cause and effect of the germ cell differentiation defect and the ISC cellular process loss. In contrast, three known strategies operate in the differentiation niche to prevent BMP signaling, thereby producing a permissive environment for germ cell differentiation. First, Lsd1, Rho, and Piwi are required in ISCs to repress <i>dpp</i> mRNA expression, thereby directly preventing BMP signaling in the differentiation niche (<a href=\"#bib7\">Eliazer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kirilly et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ma et al., 2014</a>). <i>dpp</i> encodes a BMP ligand, which activates BMP signaling important for GSC self-renewal (<a href=\"#bib43\">Xie and Spradling, 1998</a>). Second, Rho, Eggless, and EGFR signaling function in ISCs to repress the expression of <i>dally</i>, preventing BMP diffusion from the self-renewal niche to the differentiation niche (<a href=\"#bib21\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kirilly et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Dally, which is a proteoglycan protein facilitating BMP differentiation and signaling, is expressed in cap cells, the GSC self-renewal niche, to restrict BMP signaling to GSCs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyama et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Guo and Wang, 2009</a>). Third, a recent study has proposed that cap cell-initiated Wnt signaling maintains the expression of <i>tkv</i> encoding a type I BMP receptor in ISCs, thereby preventing BMP signaling in differentiated germ cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Luo et al., 2015</a>). Our findings from this study have also supported the idea that autocrine Wnt signaling in ISCs promotes GSC progeny differentiation partly by repressing BMP signaling. However, our findings have also argued that inactivating Wnt signaling does not regulate the mRNA expression levels of <i>tkv</i> and other BMP pathway components in ISCs. Therefore, future research will be needed to investigate the molecular mechanisms for Wnt signaling in the differentiation niche to prevent BMP signaling and maintain long ISC cellular processes."

Using a battery of genetic tools and molecular readouts, the Wnt signaling pathway is identified as a critical regulator of germ cell differentiation that acts, at least in part, autonomously within the ISCs. Clear evidence supports the conclusion that autonomous Wnt signaling is important for the viability of ISCs and that elevated ROS in Wnt signaling mutants contributes to the reduced viability of these cells. Conditions that lead to reduced ISC number led to accumulation of less differentiated germ cells, suggesting that Wnt-mediated maintenance of ISCs is important for controlling germ cell differentiation. The work adds a new mechanism to a developing field of study focused on understanding how individual signaling pathways that mediate interactions between ISC cells and germ cells influence germ cell biology."
