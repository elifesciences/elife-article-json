Activated by synaptically evoked NMDAR-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, the synaptic SK2-containing channels modulate excitatory post-synaptic responses and the induction of synaptic plasticity. In addition, their activity- and protein kinase A-dependent trafficking contributes to expression of long-term potentiation (LTP). We have identified a novel synaptic scaffold, MPP2 (membrane palmitoylated protein 2; p55), a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family that interacts with SK2-containing channels. MPP2 and SK2 co-immunopurified from mouse brain, and co-immunoprecipitated when they were co-expressed in HEK293 cells. MPP2 is highly expressed in the post-synaptic density of dendritic spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons. Knocking down MPP2 expression selectively abolished the SK2-containing channel contribution to synaptic responses and decreased LTP. Thus, MPP2 is a novel synaptic scaffold that is required for proper synaptic localization and function of SK2-containing channels."

Activated by synaptically evoked NMDAR-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, the synaptic SK2-containing channels modulate excitatory post-synaptic responses and the induction of synaptic plasticity. In addition, their activity- and protein kinase A-dependent trafficking contributes to expression of long-term potentiation (LTP). We have identified a novel synaptic scaffold, MPP2 (membrane palmitoylated protein 2; p55), a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family that interacts with SK2-containing channels. MPP2 and SK2 co-immunopurified from mouse brain, and co-immunoprecipitated when they were co-expressed in HEK293 cells. MPP2 is highly expressed in the post-synaptic density of dendritic spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons. Knocking down MPP2 expression selectively abolished the SK2-containing channel contribution to synaptic responses and decreased LTP. Thus, MPP2 is a novel synaptic scaffold that is required for proper synaptic localization and function of SK2-containing channels."

This signaling always occurs in the same direction: at a given synapse, one neuron sends signals that bind to receptor proteins on the surface of the receiving neuron. Repeatedly signaling across a synapse strengthens it, making it easier to communicate across, and sometimes such stimulation can cause a persistent strengthening of the synapse: this is known as long-term potentiation. Changes in synaptic strength are important for learning and memory."

                        "text": "At most excitatory synapses in the central nervous system, such as the Schaffer collateral to CA1 synapses in the <i>stratum radiatum</i> of the hippocampus, excitatory neurotransmission is largely mediated by ionotropic AMPA-type (\u03b1-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) and NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Yet, an emerging theme is that several conductances that limit membrane depolarization also make substantial contributions to the integrated excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP). For example, synaptically evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into dendritic spines activates apamin-sensitive SK2-containing channels (small conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels type 2; KCNN2), and their outward K<sup>+</sup> conductance shunts the AMPAR-mediated depolarization, effectively reducing the EPSP (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Faber et al., 2005</a>). Kv4.2-containing channels are expressed in spines, close to, but not in the PSD (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2007</a>). Synaptic activity evokes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through R-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in spines that boosts nearby Kv4.2-containing A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels to further decrease the AMPA-mediated depolarization (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels are expressed in the spines and provide further inhibitory contributions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, the sum of these repolarizing conductances may reduce the depolarizing AMPA-NMDA component by more than 50%. It is likely that each of these components can be regulated by a variety of second messenger pathways, greatly expanding the repertoire of targets to fine-tune synaptic transmission. For example, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of SK2 channels is regulated in an activity-dependent manner by co-assembled protein kinase CK2 and protein phosphatase 2A (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bildl et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Allen et al., 2007</a>) that are engaged by cholinergic signaling (<a href=\"#bib18\">Giessel and Sabatini, 2010</a>). Moreover, the various contributions to synaptic responses may be dynamic, changing in response to distinct patterns of activity. Synaptic SK2-containing channels undergo protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent endocytosis upon the induction of LTP by theta burst pairing. The endocytosis of synaptic SK2-containing channels acts together with the PKA-dependent exocytosis of additional GluA1-containing AMPARs to mediate the expression of LTP (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lin et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, after the initial expression of LTP and loss of the SK2-containing channel contribution, homeostatic mechanisms act to re-establish the synaptic SK balance (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lin et al., 2010</a>). Similarly, Kv4.2-containing channels expressed in spines undergo PKA-dependent endocytosis after the induction of LTP (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hammond et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, the appropriate localization, spatial distribution, and orchestrated dynamics of these protein complexes provide a powerful regulator of excitatory neurotransmission and plasticity."

These modular, usually multivalent scaffolds bind to synaptic receptors, channels, and signaling molecules to anchor them into their proper locations within the post-synaptic membrane (<a href=\"#bib33\">Oliva et al., 2012</a>), creating a spatially and temporally restricted signaling domain (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hammond et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Colledge et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dell\u2019Acqua et al., 2006</a>). Thus, within the post-synaptic density of excitatory synapses PSD-95 binds to NMDARs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cousins and Stephenson, 2012</a>), while SAP97 binds to AMPARs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Howard et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Leonard et al., 1998</a>), and Shank and Homer may serve as modular organizers of the lattice of synaptic MAGUKs (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sheng and Kim, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hayashi et al., 2009</a>). However, the molecular mechanisms that engender synaptic localization and dynamics to SK2-containing channels are not well understood. There are two major isoforms of SK2 that are expressed in CA1 pyramidal neurons; SK2-L (long) has an extended intracellular N-terminal domain compared to SK2-S (short) and the two isoforms co-assemble into heteromeric channels (<a href=\"#bib41\">Strassmaier et al., 2005</a>). In mice that selectively lack SK2-L expression, the SK2-S channels are expressed in the plasma membrane of dendrites and dendritic spines, yet fail to become incorporated into the post-synaptic membrane. Consequently, the SK2-containing channel contributions to EPSPs and plasticity are absent, and this loss of synaptic SK2-containing channel function enhances hippocampus-dependent learning tasks (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2011</a>). To identify proteins that might serve to localize synaptic SK2-containing channels, candidate SK2 interacting proteins were identified. One of them, the MAGUK protein MPP2 (membrane palmitoylated protein 2), is localized to the PSD and is essential for synaptic SK2-containing channel function."

To further investigate this interaction, two newly generated antibodies targeting MPP2 were tested. Probing Western blots of proteins prepared from total mouse brain with either MPP2 antibody detected a predominant band at ~55\u2009kDa.

The results demonstrated that both antibodies robustly purified MPP2 and co-purified SK2 as well as SK3. In addition, these experiments identified DLG1 (SAP97) and Lin-homologs 7A and 7C as proteins co-assembling with MPP2 in rodent brain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To rule out off-target effects of the two MPP2 antibodies, we tested their binding of C8-tagged of SAP97, Lin7A, or Lin7C, C8-tagged versions of each of these proteins after expression in HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). While all 8-tagged proteins were recognized by anti-C8 antibody only C8-MPP2 was recognized by anti-MPP2 antibodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). MPP2, a member of the p55 Stardust family of MAGUK proteins, is predicted to be a 552 amino acid protein. Like most MAGUKs, MPP2 is a modular protein comprised of several distinct protein-protein interaction domains. There are two predicted L27 domains, followed by a single predicted PDZ domain, and then the SH3-HOOK-GK domains."

Immunoprecipitations were performed using an anti-SK2 antibody raised in guinea pig that is directed to the common C-terminal domain of the two SK2 isoforms, or using IgG as a control. Precipitated proteins were prepared as Western blots. Probing with anti-SK2 antibody that was raised in rabbits and directed against the same C-terminal sequence, demonstrated equivalent SK2 expression for input and after immunoprecipitation in each sample (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Probing with anti-C8 antibody detected a band of the appropriate apparent molecular weight for C8-MPP2 in the sample co-expressed with SK2-S plus SK2-L but not in the IgG control sample (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Probing with anti-PSD-95 antibody did not detect co-immunoprecipitation with SK2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The results demonstrated that C8-MPP2 but not PSD-95 was specifically co-precipitated with SK2. To examine the possibility that SAP97 interacts with SK2-S, C8-SAP97 was co-expressed in HEK293 cells together with either myc-SK2-S or GluA1, a known SAP97 interaction partner (<a href=\"#bib27\">Leonard et al., 1998</a>). Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-SK2 antibody, anti-GluA1 antibody, or IgG as a control. Western blotting with anti-C8 antibody revealed that C8-SAP97 only co-immunoprecipitated when co-expressed with GluA1, despite equivalent levels of input and immunoprecipitated proteins (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To test if MPP2 interacts with the unique N-terminal domain of SK2-L that is required for synaptic localization GST pull-down experiments were performed. While PDZ interactions are important for many MAGUK-partner protein interactions, the unique N-terminal domain of SK2-L does not contain a PDZ ligand motif and using the PDZ domain from MPP2 failed to show an interaction with the N-terminal domain of SK2-L. Therefore, the SH3-HOOK-GK domain of MPP2 was employed. This domain of MPP2 as well the SH3-HOOK-GK domains from SAP97, a MAGUK scaffold of a distinct subfamily from MPP2 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Oliva et al., 2012</a>), or the SH3-HOOK-GK domain from CaCNB4, a non-canonical MAGUK protein that is a beta subunit for voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib42\">Van Petegem et al., 2004</a>) were prepared as GST-fusion proteins, bound to glutathione-agarose beads, and used as baits for the prey, the His-tagged N-terminal domain of SK2-L. A GST-fusion protein of the C-terminal domain of Kv1.4, and a His-fusion protein of PSD-93 (Chapsyn) were also prepared as positive interaction controls (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lunn et al., 2007</a>). Coomassie staining and Western blotting with anti-GST antibody verified equivalent amounts of the baits, either as input or bound to beads (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). After exposure to the baits, bound prey proteins were eluted and prepared as Western blots. Probing with an anti-His antibody showed that the SH3-HOOK-GK domain from MPP2, but not from SAP97 or CaCNB4, specifically pulled down the N-terminal domain of SK2-L. As expected, the C-terminal domain of Kv1.4 pulled down PSD-93 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Taken together these results suggest that MPP2 interacts with the unique N-terminal domain of SK2-L that is required for synaptic localization (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2011</a>)."

At the light level, MPP2 was expressed throughout the hippocampus, and in area CA1, MPP2 was predominantly expressed in the dendritic arbors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). To determine the subcellular profile of MPP2 expression, pre- and post-embedding immuno-gold electron microscopy (iEM) was performed. Using pre-embedding techniques, sections from three animals revealed immunoparticles for MPP2 prominently labeled dendritic spines and dendritic shafts both along the plasma membrane and at intracellular sites. Post-synaptically, most immunoparticles for MPP2 were found in spines (84%; 436 particles) versus in dendrites (16%; 82 immunoparticles), with most immunoparticles in either compartment localized to the plasma membrane (84%; 365 immunoparticles in spines and 65%; 54 immunoparticles in dendrites). Next, post-embedding techniques were applied to determine if MPP2 is expressed in the post-synaptic density. Sections from three animals revealed that immunoparticles for MPP2 prominently labeled the post-synaptic densities of dendritic spines, as well as being detected in dendritic shafts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>).

This might reflect effects of MPP2 knock-down on other interaction partners (see below)."

Compared to SK2-S, SK2-L has an additional 207 amino acids in the intracellular N-terminal domain and SK2-S is otherwise entirely contained in SK2-L (<a href=\"#bib41\">Strassmaier et al., 2005</a>). In a transgenic mouse selectively lacking SK2-L, the SK2-S channels are expressed in the dendrites and even in the plasma membrane of dendritic spines, but they are specifically excluded from the PSD, and apamin fails to boost synaptically evoked EPSPs. Re-expressing SK2-L reinstates synaptic function as measured by apamin sensitivity of EPSPs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2011</a>). These results implicated the unique N-terminal domain of SK2-L in directing SK2-containing channel synaptic localization and function, and suggested that the N-terminal domain of SK2-L might interact with a partner protein to engender PSD localization. Indeed, MPP2 binds to the unique N-terminal domain and knocking down MPP2 expression phenocopied the effect of SK2-L deletion on synaptic responses. MAGUK proteins recruit and stabilize AMPA and NMDA receptors in the PSD. Our results suggest that MPP2 similarly serves to stabilize SK2-containing channels in the PSD."

Similar to other MAGUK scaffold proteins, MPP2 is modular, consisting of two L27 domains that may mediate homo- or heterophilic interactions, a single PDZ domain followed by SH3-HOOK-GK domains. Biochemical studies showed that MPP2 is enriched in the PSD fractions of rat brain, and pull-down assays to test for interactions suggested MPP2 may interact with itself as well as a number of other synaptic proteins, among them are PSD-95, SAP97, GKAP, CASK, GRIP, neuroligin, and CaMKII.

In epithelial cells, MPP7, a closely related member of the p55 Stardust family, dimerizes with Lin7 proteins, an interaction mediated by the C-terminal L27 domain, and the dimeric complex then associates with DLG1 via the N-terminal L27 domain that is insufficient to mediate DLG1 interactions in the absence of bound Lin7 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bohl et al., 2007</a>). DLG1 also binds the C-terminal PDZ ligand on the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Leonard et al., 1998</a>). Indeed, upon the induction of LTP at Schaffer collateral to CA1 synapses, additional GluA1-containing AMPA receptors undergo exocytosis at a perisynaptic site followed by translocation into the post-synaptic membrane, increasing the AMPA component of EPSPs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2008</a>). This exocytosis is dependent on the PDZ ligand at the C-terminus of the GluA1 subunit (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Shi et al., 2001</a>), and exocytosis of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors is prerequisite to SK2-containing channel endocytosis; specifically blocking GluA1-containing AMPA receptor exocytosis prevents the rapid, subsequent endocytosis of SK2-containing channels (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lin et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, immunopurification of AMPA receptors from whole brain identified MPP2 as a protein that co-purified with AMPA receptors (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schwenk et al., 2012</a>). Synaptic SK2-containing channels reside in very close proximity to synaptic NMDA receptors within the PSD, providing a molecular microdomain that facilitates their functional coupling (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lin et al., 2008</a>). PSD-95 interacts with NMDARs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kornau et al., 1995</a>), is crucial for the proper synaptic localization of ionotropic glutamate receptors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Schnell et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Elias et al., 2008</a>), and interacts with SAP97 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cai et al., 2006</a>). It will be interesting to determine whether MPP2 additionally interacts, directly or indirectly with PSD-95 to maintain the spatial synaptic relationship between SK2-containing channels and NMDA receptors. MPP2 contains multiple different protein-protein interaction domains that may bind not only receptors and channels but, additionally, signaling molecules as well as connections to the cytoskeleton. These observations raise the possibility that there is a dynamic protein lattice encompassing SK2-containing channels, AMPARs and NMDARs, and regulatory proteins that is woven together by molecular interactions between scaffold proteins to precisely tune synaptic responses during basal neurotransmission and plasticity."

Sections were then treated with osmium tetraoxide (1% in 0.1 M PB), block-stained with uranyl acetate, dehydrated in graded series of ethanol and flat-embedded on glass slides in Durcupan (Sigma-Aldrich) resin. Regions of interest were cut at 70\u201390 nm on an ultramicrotome (Reichert Ultracut E, Leica Biosystems, Barcelona, Spain) and collected on 200-mesh copper grids. Staining was performed on drops of 1% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by Reynolds\u2019s lead citrate."

Digitized electron images were modified for color, brightness, and contrast with Adobe Photoshop, version 7.0. Labelled structures were classified based on unambiguous morphological information in each section. Axon terminals were identified by the presence of synapses and small round and/or large granular vesicles. Synapses were identified as parallel membranes separated by widened clefts that were associated with membrane specializations. Synapses displaying a prominent density on the post-synaptic side were characterized as asymmetrical. Dendritic spines were identified as small protrusions exhibiting membrane continuity with the dendritic shaft. Significance of immunogold particle labelling in GFP-positive versus GFP-negative spines and dendrites was assessed by ANOVA."

If cultured neurons have synapses mirroring native synapses, we would see immunoreactivity for MPP2 \u2013 or for PSD-95 \u2013 in spines without resolution to the synapse itself that is only provided by post-embedding immunoEM. It is also unclear what additional information would be conveyed by comparisons to PSD-95. But in fact we have studied PSD-95 localization by iEM in previous work (Lin et al., Nat. Neurosci. 2008; Allen et al., Nat. Neurosci. 2011; Fukaya and Watanabe, J. Comp. Neurol. 2000), and we see no difference in the subcellular localization of MPP2 and PSD-95. Both proteins are integral PSD components and are also localized to a lesser extent to the dendrites. Consistent with other studies with PSD-95, MPP2 also appears to be distributed evenly across the PSD consistent with comprising part of a backbone that stabilizes its binding partners at the synapse (see DeGioris, Galbraith, Dosemeci, Chen and Reese, Brain, Cell Biol.2006)"

For example we have never recorded an apamin effect on EPSPs, nor even an SK current in cultured neurons. Thus, while cultured neurons may be useful for insights into glutamate receptors, it has become clear in the last several years that additional conductances make important contributions to post-synaptic responses in native spines and not all of these are recapitulated in neuronal cultures."

It is indeed possible that SAP97 levels, or other synaptic proteins are reduced or altered by MPP2 shRNA expression. Using our online tool, we found no evidence that SAP97 mRNA would be knocked down by the MPP2 shRNAs. Thus if MPP2 knockdown is associated with altered levels of SAP97 this is more likely to be a consequence of MPP2 knockdown and compensatory changes at the level of the synapse than to a spurious cross-reaction of the shRNA with SAP97 mRNA. Our follow up studies are focused on collateral consequences of MPP2 loss for synaptic physiology. It is unclear how far the reviewers want us to go to search for possible off-target effects when we provide the explicit specificity control of the shRNA immune MPP2 rescuing the knockdown phenotype on which this work is focused."
