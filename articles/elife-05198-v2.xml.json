When it recodes mRNAs, it gives organisms the option to express diverse, functionally distinct, protein isoforms. All eumetazoans, from cnidarians to humans, express RNA editing enzymes. However, transcriptome-wide screens have only uncovered about 25 transcripts harboring conserved recoding RNA editing sites in mammals and several hundred recoding sites in <i>Drosophila</i>. These studies on few established models have led to the general assumption that recoding by RNA editing is extremely rare. Here we employ a novel bioinformatic approach with extensive validation to show that the squid <i>Doryteuthis pealeii</i> recodes proteins by RNA editing to an unprecedented extent. We identify 57,108 recoding sites in the nervous system, affecting the majority of the proteins studied. Recoding is tissue-dependent, and enriched in genes with neuronal and cytoskeletal functions, suggesting it plays an important role in brain physiology."

When it recodes mRNAs, it gives organisms the option to express diverse, functionally distinct, protein isoforms. All eumetazoans, from cnidarians to humans, express RNA editing enzymes. However, transcriptome-wide screens have only uncovered about 25 transcripts harboring conserved recoding RNA editing sites in mammals and several hundred recoding sites in <i>Drosophila</i>. These studies on few established models have led to the general assumption that recoding by RNA editing is extremely rare. Here we employ a novel bioinformatic approach with extensive validation to show that the squid <i>Doryteuthis pealeii</i> recodes proteins by RNA editing to an unprecedented extent. We identify 57,108 recoding sites in the nervous system, affecting the majority of the proteins studied. Recoding is tissue-dependent, and enriched in genes with neuronal and cytoskeletal functions, suggesting it plays an important role in brain physiology."

Many of the identified mRNA molecules had been recoded in more than one place, and many more of these than expected changed the amino acid sequence of the protein translated from them. Alon et al. therefore suggest that RNA editing may have been crucial in the evolution of the squid's nervous system, and suggest that recoding should be considered a normal part of the process used by squids to make proteins."

RNA editing by deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) is another process used to alter genetic information (<a href=\"#bib20\">Nishikura, 2010</a>). Unlike alternative splicing, which shuffles relatively large regions of RNA, editing targets single bases in order to fine-tune protein function. Because inosine is interpreted as guanosine by the cellular machinery, this process can recode codons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Basilio et al., 1962</a>). A-to-I RNA editing is catalyzed by the ADAR (adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA) family of enzymes. All eumetazoans, from cnidarians to mammals, express ADARs but the extent to which they use them to recode has been explored in few representatives (<a href=\"#bib20\">Nishikura, 2010</a>)."

So far, such studies have been limited to organisms with a sequenced genome (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ramaswami et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2013</a>). In general, these screens have looked for variation in RNA at positions that are invariant in the genome. In humans, inosine is abundant in RNA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Paul and Bass, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bazak et al., 2014</a>), but almost all of it lies within transcribed repetitive elements in untranslated regions or introns (<a href=\"#bib20\">Nishikura, 2010</a>). A compilation of recoding sites in human transcriptomes revealed 1183 events (<a href=\"#bib32\">Xu and Zhang, 2014</a>), but most were observed in only a single sample. Individual searches (<a href=\"#bib9\">Danecek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ramaswami et al., 2013</a>) uncovered only 115 (non-repetitive) recoding events, and 53 in mice; 34 recoding sites are conserved across mammals (<a href=\"#bib24\">Pinto et al., 2014</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, an order of magnitude more recoding sites have been identified, residing in about 3% of all messages (<a href=\"#bib29\">St Laurent et al., 2013</a>). Although individual editing sites are clearly essential (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brusa et al., 1995</a>), these data suggest that RNA editing is not a broadly used mechanism for proteome diversification."

For example, using traditional cloning methods, scores of recoding sites have been uncovered in a small number of squid and octopus transcripts encoding potassium channels, ADARs, and ion pumps (<a href=\"#bib11\">Garrett and Rosenthal, 2012a</a>). As for most organisms, there are no genomes available for cephalopods. Here we apply a novel approach for editing site detection in the absence of a sequenced genome. We use it to comprehensively identify editing sites in the squid giant axon system and other areas of the nervous system. Surprisingly, almost 60% of all mRNAs studied harbor recoding events, and most at multiple sites. These data show orders of magnitude more recoding in the squid proteome than in any other species studied to date. In squid, editing is so pervasive that the central dogma should be modified to include this process. Our results open the possibility that extensive recoding is common in many organisms, rivaling alternative splicing as a means of creating functional diversity."

Our method differed from previous approaches by using a de novo transcriptome as the point of reference instead of a genome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The transcriptome was assembled from RNA-seq reads, and each nucleotide within it represents the consensus of many reads. If the majority of RNA reads were edited (\u2018strong\u2019 editing sites), the transcriptome would differ from the genomic DNA and read \u2018G\u2019 where gDNA reads would show \u2018A\u2019 (the sequencing process identifies inosines as guanosines). We detected such sites by aligning DNA-seq reads to the transcriptome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). At positions where editing occurred in the minority of RNA-seq reads (\u2018weak\u2019 editing sites), however, the transcriptome and the genomic DNA would be identical. These sites were detected by identifying variability in RNA-seq, but not DNA-seq, reads (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This general approach is applicable to all organisms that lack a sequenced genome."

The GFL and OL RNA-seq reads were used to construct a transcriptome model (<a href=\"#bib13\">Grabherr et al., 2011</a>). To focus on editing sites inside <i>bona fide</i> coding regions, we retained only transcript-fragments with open reading frames (ORFs) homologous to known proteins (<a href=\"#bib31\">UniProt Consortium, 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and used the editing detection procedures outlined in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>.

Only 12,403 weak sites and 219 strong sites were identified for the other 11 possible types of modifications. These numbers suggest false-positive rates of 15% and 4% respectively, mainly due to transcriptome assembly problems, SNPs, somatic mutations and systematic mis-alignments. Note that these false-positive rates are considerably lower than those for similar searches for editing within human coding sequences, where a genome reference was employed (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ramaswami et al., 2013</a>)."

In addition, hierarchical clustering of results from five tissues reveals that A-to-G modifications, but not other types, exhibit clear tissue-specificity, suggesting they do not result from genomic polymorphisms and mapping artifacts (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). No A-to-G overrepresentation is observed in mitochondria-encoded genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), in agreement with the absence of ADARs, and by extension A-to-I editing, in the mitochondria. Finally, direct Sanger sequencing from a second individual confirmed editing at 40/40 A-to-G sites, and deep-sequencing validated 120/143 A-to-G sites but none of the 12 non A-to-G sites tested (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C\u2013G</a>). Taken together, the overrepresentation of A-to-G modifications over all other types, the motifs surrounding the A-to-G sites, the tissue-specific modification levels, and the validation experiments, provide evidence that the majority of the A-to-G modifications are true editing events, while most non A-to-G modifications are likely technical artifacts or genomic variations (<a href=\"#bib33\">Zaranek et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ramaswami et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

                        "text": "Unlike with humans, the large number of A-to-I editing events translates into a large number of recoding events: Overall, 57,108 recoding events were detected in 6991/12,039 ORFs. These numbers are orders of magnitude higher than any other species studied (<a href=\"#bib9\">Danecek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ramaswami et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">St Laurent et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Pinto et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Moreover, a large fraction of the proteins are recoded at multiple sites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>): about 1/3 harbor \u22653 sites and 10% harbor \u226510 sites. Even when focusing only on recoding sites with editing levels &gt;10%, about 10% of the squid proteins harbor \u22655 sites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). On the extreme end of the spectrum, the ORFs encoding \u03b1 Spectrin and Piccolo have 247 and 182 recoding sites, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It should be noted that only annotated ORFs were examined in our pipeline, and the number of editing sites did not saturate with respect to the number of sequence reads (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Moreover, incompleteness of the de novo transcriptome, as well as incorrect assembly of paralogs and splice variants, may cause our pipeline to miss many additional sites (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). Therefore there are probably many more recoding sites in the squid transcriptome."

Have squid ADARs evolved novel structures that account for the high-level editing? A past study showed that a squid ADAR2 ortholog can be expressed as two isoforms due to alternative splicing (<a href=\"#bib21\">Palavicini et al., 2009</a>): one, having two double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding motifs, resembles vertebrate ADAR2s. A second, however, contains an \u2018extra\u2019 dsRNA binding motif at its N-terminus. This non-canonical isoform edits RNA more efficiently, edits more sites, and binds dsRNA with a far higher affinity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Palavicini et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2012</a>). Further Squid ADAR2 messages themselves contain many editing sites, leading to many subtly different isoforms. An ADAR1 isoform is also present in our transcriptome and is the focus of an ongoing study. An equally intriguing question is why squid edit to this extent? The process clearly creates tremendous protein diversity, and this may in part explain the behavioral sophistication of these complex invertebrates. A recent study showed that editing can be used for temperature adaptation in octopus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Garrett and Rosenthal, 2012b</a>) and this makes sense based on the codon changes that it catalyzes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Garrett and Rosenthal, 2012a</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013D</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, editing can respond to acute temperature changes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Savva et al., 2012</a>). The large number of sites in squid suggests that editing is well positioned to respond to environmental variation. Most model organisms studied so far are mammals which are homeotherms. Future studies of more diverse species are needed to reveal the extent to which cold-blooded organisms might utilize extensive editing to respond to temperature changes and other environmental variables."

In the following, bases called with quality score Q &lt; 30 were discarded. Note, however, that Trinity consensus sequence does take into account these bases, as well as reads that might have not been uniquely aligned to the transcriptome. It is often customary to filter out reads' ends when analyzing RNA-DNA mismatches. A main reason for that is the common mismatches at reads' ends due to alignment artifacts when a splicing junction occurs near the ends. In our case, as alignment is done to the transcriptome, we did not observe any increase in AG mismatch rate near reads' ends (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), and thus no such filter was used. Two procedures were used to detect editing sites: (<b>A</b>) \u2018weak\u2019 editing sites procedure: a binomial test was applied to find the significant modifications between RNA reads and the Swiss-Prot ORFs. The binomial statistics uses the number of successes (the number of reads with a mismatch of a given type in a given position), the number of trials (the total number of RNA reads aligned to the given position) and the error probability. The probability of having a sequencing error (the error probability) was estimated using the sequence quality score. We counted only mismatches with &gt;=30 quality score, and therefore the expected error probability was set to 0.1%. The binomial test was applied to every position inside the Swiss-Prot ORFs. The p-value for each location was corrected for multiple testing using a Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate of 10%. Furthermore, in order to exclude RNA variability due to genomic polymorphisms, we filtered out all modification sites in which any of the DNA reads aligned to the site does not agree with the transcriptome. This procedure assumes the RNA consensus in the site is identical to the gDNA reads, and thus is not suited to detect sites in which the editing appear in most of the RNA reads and therefore also in the Trinity-generated ORFs (\u2018strong\u2019 editing sites). (<b>B</b>) \u2018strong\u2019 editing sites procedure: the locations in which all DNA reads showed a different base than the ORF. The probability of such sites to be not a result of editing but rather a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was estimated by (1/2)<sup>(#DNA reads)</sup> (no allele-specific expression) multiplied by the prior probability of a SNP which was taken to be 0.001. Here too, the p-value for each location was corrected for multiple testing using a Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate of 10%."

Another way to look at the dependence between the RNA coverage and the detected number of weak A-to-G sites is by recording the number of A-to-G sites detected in each ORF as a function of the ORF RNA coverage. The sorted RNA coverage was divided into ten equal bins and the mean number of A-to-G sites in each bin was calculated.

(c) If at least three DNA reads showed the same flanking sequence starting from the same position inside the ORFs, it was considered to be an intron fragment. This procedure revealed the positions of part of the exon\u2013exon junctions and part of the intron sequences that correspond to the junctions. Overall, this procedure resulted in about 2100 regions, containing \u223c5% of all the detected editing sites, in which the gDNA and the cDNA could potentially be differentially amplified."

(b) 20 regions randomly-selected from the above dataset of \u223c2100 regions. (c) 20 regions randomly-selected from the set of putatively edited regions for which we could not design unique gDNA primers, and thus gDNA and the cDNA could not be differentially amplified. For this group the same primers were used to amplify the gDNA and the cDNA. As with the Sanger validation experiment, the deep sequencing validations were done using GFL tissue from a single animal (different from the animals used for the HiSeq and Sanger sequencing experiments). All primer sets were designed with an overhang so that sequencing and indexing primers could be added to the amplicons in a nested PCR reaction. Samples from gDNA and cDNA were distinguished by unique sequencing indexes. After nested PCR, amplicons were pooled, purified by Ampure XP (Beckman Coulter, Danvers, MA), and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. All the cDNA targets were amplified, but only 49 of the 60 gDNA targets amplified well enough for analysis (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1E,F</a>). For the other eleven targets, the presence of undetected introns could have disrupted amplification. The DNA and RNA reads were analyzed using the same detection procedure described above (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), with the sole exception that sequence variations below 0.1% (the expected sequencing error rate) were allowed in the DNA reads (as mandated by the much larger DNA coverage in this validation study). Altogether, 84% (120 out of 143) of the A-to-G sites examined were validated (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1F,G</a>). In contrast, none of the 12 non A-to-G sites examined were validated. Moreover, 170 additional A-to-G sites (86% of all novel detected sites, a similar fraction to the HiSeq data used in the original detection, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) were identified, more than doubling the number of A-to-G sites detected. Similar results were observed for the three groups examined. Finally, for the validated A-to-G sites, high correlation was obtained between the editing levels (the fraction of cDNA reads exhibiting the editing in a given position) measured using the HiSeq data and the MiSeq data (Pearson's r of 0.86, p-value = 1e-35) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>)."

In this analysis, the homologs to the human proteins can be: (a) \u2018heavily edited\u2019, defined as proteins for which the cumulative recoding level, that is the editing level summed over all recoding sites, exceeds unity, (b) \u2018edited\u2019, if the protein has at least one recoding site, (c) not edited, or (d) not identifiable in the squid transcriptome. Editing levels were calculated using data from the GFL and OL tissues combined. On average, 74% and 22% of the identifiable proteins in each pathway are edited or heavily edited, respectively. Pathways related to the nervous system are even more extensively edited: 75% and 35% of the identifiable proteins in these pathways are edited and heavily edited, respectively. On the flip side, in the pathways \u2018Ribosome\u2019 and \u2018RNA polymerase\u2019 only 50% and 33% of the identifiable proteins are edited and 0% and 4% of the identifiable proteins are heavily edited, respectively (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1I</a>), demonstrating that some crucial pathways are protected from editing. We have also specifically examined the extent of recoding in squid ORFs that encode voltage and neurotransmitter gated ion channels, ion transporters, synaptic release machinery and molecular motors. Overall, we examined 87 ORFs that are homologous to the following proteins: Voltage-gated potassium channel alpha subunit, Voltage-dependent sodium channel alpha subunit, Voltage-dependent calcium channels, Ionotropic glutamate receptors, Synaptotagmin, Synaptobrevin, Syntaxin, Synapsin, Snap 25, Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase alpha subunit, Sodium/calcium exchanger (SLC8), Sodium bicarbonate exchanger (SLC4), Sodium/hydrogen exchanger (SLC9), Sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger (SLC24), Dynein, and Kinesin (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1J</a>).

In squid, the expected fraction of nonsynonymous changes is 0.65, estimated by random changes of adenosines in the ORFs, accounting for the observed local sequence preference of the editing sites (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), as follows: (a) we examined the sequence surrounding sites detected as edited (the base preceding and the following the site), and counted the number of times each one of the 16 possible combinations of upstream and downstream nucleotide appears. These numbers were normalized by the number of times each combination appears for all the A bases in all the ORFs, to produce the observed probability of being targeted by editing given a certain combination of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 nucleotides. (b) all the locations inside the ORFs were screened in a random order until an A base was encountered. (c) a random number was generated, if it was below the normalized probability corresponding to the sequence surrounding the site in question, this site was selected for further use. (d) the potential effect on the codon due to changing the A base to G was examined, in particular, whether the change is nonsynonymous or synonymous. (e) steps (b\u2013d) were repeated until the number of A bases changed matched the observed number of editing sites. The described randomization procedure was also used to calculate the expected codon changes due to editing (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We found that the higher the editing levels, the higher the fraction of nonsynonymous changes, and for editing levels &gt;20% the nonsynonymous fraction is significantly higher than the expected fraction of 0.65 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

Therefore, each squid ORF was aligned against the conserved domains in the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) using DELTA-BLAST (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boratyn et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Marchler-Bauer et al., 2013</a>). DELTA-BLAST calculates the position-specific score matrices (PSSM) for each possible amino acid substitution. Positive scores indicate that a certain amino acid substitution occurs more frequently in the alignment against the conserved domains than expected by chance, while negative scores indicate that the substitution occurs less frequently than expected. The substitution score of each editing event was recorded as well as the editing level in the same position, using data from the GFL and OL tissues combined. As a control, the editing levels in all the sites with the same recoding type were randomly shuffled. This accounts for the fact that editing creates specific amino acid changes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>), and in turn, these specific changes may be correlated with average editing levels and with substitution scores. Thus, the shuffled dataset preserves both the distribution of recoding types and the distribution of editing levels for each recoding type. This analysis revealed that the average editing levels in sites with large negative substitution scores, which may be deleterious, are significantly lower than what is expected by chance (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). The distribution of recoding sites for each substitution score was calculated and compared with random changes that preserve the sequence preference and the total number of editing events (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Consistent with the above finding, there are significantly less recoding sites with large negative substitution score than expected by chance (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Finally, on average, the higher the editing level in a given site, the higher the average substitution score, above what is expected by chance (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Thus, this analysis indicates that recoding by editing tends to avoid potentially deleterious sites and that editing sites with high editing levels might be more important functionally than editing sites with low editing levels."

The same pipeline as described above was applied to the data, with one single exception: while comparing the transcriptome model with SwissProt we used only non-vertebrate SwissProt sequences, in order to mimic the situation for squid in which there are no SwissProt entries from closely related species. The analysis of the human and macaque data was done for two purposes: (<b>A</b>) to show that the enormous number of AG mismatches in the squid data is real and not an artefact of the analysis pipeline, and (<b>B</b>) to demonstrate that our pipeline could identify RNA editing sites established by previous studies. The results of the analysis are summarized in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>. For non-AG mismatches, we obtained roughly the same numbers as those for squid. However, as expected, the AG mismatches in the human and macaque samples did not show any enrichment, and their abundance (in coding regions) was similar to those for other mismatches. In other words, the sensitivity of our method allows the detection of the super-strong editing signal of squid, but cannot separate the rare editing sites in mammals (in coding regions) from noise. Note that the task of detecting recoding sites in mammals is highly non-trivial even when one takes advantage of all information available, including the accurate genome sequence. The best efforts, so far, have yielded enrichment of AG mismatches, but still most detected sites are non-AG (i.e., most-probably, false-positives) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ramaswami et al., 2013</a>)."

Are there estimations about the impact of alternative splicing and paralogs in squid? Any impact of this on the results should be discussed in the text. Also, the text should clarify that this is not a completely de novo method since genomic sequences are generated."

While for the human and macaque control, the RNA and DNA samples are from the same tissues, in the case of squid, RNA samples are from the tissues from the nervous system, while DNA is from the sperm sack.

All tools for de novo transcript assembly have limited accuracy, particularly when they try to predict close paralogs and splice variants from short cDNA reads. These shortcomings may lead to false-positives in our pipeline, which add to errors caused by the more familiar somatic mutations, SNPs, and alignment errors that are common to all editing detection schemes. As is the case for all editing detection pipelines, the challenge is to minimize noise level to the extent that true editing sites are not buried in the noise. Here, we are able to apply our pipeline to squid despite the above described errors because the editing signal is enormous."

First, all of the sources of error outlined above are not expected to be biased towards A-to-G mismatches. Even if they were, they should not be biased towards the expressed strand of the DNA (i.e. one should expect equal numbers of A-to-G and T-to-C mismatches on the expressed strand if they were true errors). Accordingly, we conclude that the level of non-AG mismatches detected, which we used to estimate the false-discovery rate, already includes the sum of all of the above types of error (and any additional ones of unknown source). The dramatic overrepresentation of A-to-G mismatches over non-AG ones (including T-to-C) is therefore strong evidence that most of the detected A-to-G modifications are due to bona fide ADAR editing. Our conclusions are further supported by the fact that edited adenosines are surrounded by ADAR\u2019s preferred nucleotide motif, that, as with other organisms, editing sites are clustered, and through direct validation of a randomly selected subset of the sites. That being said, we do expect a false discovery rate of 10-15% in our list of \u223c90,000 predicted sites, and these thousands of false-positives are probably due to inaccurate assembly, SNPs, somatic mutations and misalignments."

That being said, we did make a rough estimate of ADAR expression to answer this query. By ranking each component from our transcriptome we found that squid ADAR1 ranks at 0.92 and squid ADAR2 ranks at 0.48 for the GFL tissue, where 1 is the most expressed component, and 0 the least expressed component. These numbers are not very different from the situation in the human brain, where (based on the normal total brain tissue in Human Body Map dataset), ADAR1 is ranked at \u223c0.9 and ADAR2 \u223c0.5 (numbers are approximate, as different exons behave differently, and identifying the expression levels of the different splice variants is not trivial). This is only a rough estimate, and there are several delicate problems in this comparison; therefore we prefer not to make the claim that the expression levels are indeed similar in the text. However, we are working under the hypothesis that other differences between squid and mammalian ADARs (see below) are more likely to be of importance here."

We\u2019d like to stress, however, that it is only part of the puzzle. Vertebrate ADAR2\u2019s have an invariant domain structure: they are composed of 2 N terminal double stranded RNA binding motifs (dsRBMs) followed by a conserved catalytic domain. Squid ADAR2 can have an additional dsRBM at its N terminus which is included in about half the transcripts through splicing (Palavicini et al., 2009). Thus, there is a canonical ADAR2 with 2 dsRBMS and a non-canonical one with three. When produced recombinantly in yeast and tested in vitro on a squid K channel mRNA substrate, the non-canonical version edits far more sites. This version also has a much higher affinity for dsRNA (Palavicini et al., 2012). Another interesting feature of the squid ADAR2 is that its own messages are abundantly edited, leading to multiple isoforms. The specificities of the individual isoforms have yet to be tested."

At its N-terminus, however, it contains a highly basic domain that contains scores of phosphorylation sites. Squid ADAR1 messages are also highly edited. A graduate student in the Rosenthal lab has produced recombinant Squid ADAR1 and is currently characterizing its function for her doctoral project. Because it contains many differences from vertebrate orthologs, a full-functional characterization is a complex undertaking. Although its structure is clearly interesting, we prefer not to include Squid ADAR1 sequence data in this manuscript because only through structure-function studies can we assess whether its unique features might contribute to high-level editing.
