                    "text": "Asynchronous transmission plays a prominent role at certain synapses but lacks the mechanistic insights of its synchronous counterpart. The current view posits that triggering of asynchronous release during repetitive stimulation involves expansion of the same calcium domains underlying synchronous transmission. In this study, live imaging and paired patch clamp recording at the zebrafish neuromuscular synapse reveal contributions by spatially distinct calcium sources. Synchronous release is tied to calcium entry into synaptic boutons via P/Q type calcium channels, whereas asynchronous release is boosted by a propagating intracellular calcium source initiated at off-synaptic locations in the axon and axonal branch points. This secondary calcium source fully accounts for the persistence following termination of the stimulus and sensitivity to slow calcium buffers reported for asynchronous release. The neuromuscular junction and CNS neurons share these features, raising the possibility that secondary calcium sources are common among synapses with prominent asynchronous release."

The current view posits that triggering of asynchronous release during repetitive stimulation involves expansion of the same calcium domains underlying synchronous transmission. In this study, live imaging and paired patch clamp recording at the zebrafish neuromuscular synapse reveal contributions by spatially distinct calcium sources. Synchronous release is tied to calcium entry into synaptic boutons via P/Q type calcium channels, whereas asynchronous release is boosted by a propagating intracellular calcium source initiated at off-synaptic locations in the axon and axonal branch points. This secondary calcium source fully accounts for the persistence following termination of the stimulus and sensitivity to slow calcium buffers reported for asynchronous release. The neuromuscular junction and CNS neurons share these features, raising the possibility that secondary calcium sources are common among synapses with prominent asynchronous release."

This is thought to account for a sustained release of the neurotransmitter that continues even in the absence of nerve action potentials. This is called asynchronous release."

Imaging experiments on these toxin-treated zebrafish revealed that a wave of calcium ions that propagated from a distant source coincided with the onset of asynchronous release. This wave of calcium fully accounted for the delayed onset and the persistence of asynchronous release following termination of the action potentials. This study further demonstrates that asynchronous release can be triggered by calcium ions that do not enter through the P/Q calcium channels."

According to this idea, synchronous release is triggered by highly localized calcium transients resulting from the opening of calcium channels near the active zones (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adler et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Stanley, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Neher, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Meinrenken et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Augustine et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Eggermann et al., 2012</a>), whereas a more slowly decaying component of intracellular calcium is proposed to account for the asynchronous release (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rahamimoff and Yaari, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goda and Stevens, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cummings et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Atluri and Regehr, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen and Regehr, 1999</a>). The slow accumulation of calcium during repeated stimulation can potentially account for both the delayed onset and persistence (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lu and Trussell, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</a>). Much of the evidence for this idea rests on the observation that the slow calcium buffer EGTA can block asynchronous release while leaving synchronous release intact (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adler et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cummings et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Atluri and Regehr, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Lu and Trussell, 2000</a>).

In one recent case however, an unexpected source of calcium for asynchronous release was reported in the form of an unusual voltage dependent calcium channel type that provides persistent calcium entry (<a href=\"#bib12\">Few et al., 2012</a>). Our investigation into possible separate sources of calcium in zebrafish motor neurons was prompted by our observation that a block of calcium entry through the presynaptic P/Q calcium channels fully inhibited synchronous release, leaving asynchronous release intact. Zebrafish NMJ offers a unique opportunity to explore the temporal and spatial relationships between calcium entry and the two release modes through combining paired recording and live calcium imaging. We now present evidence for a source of off-synapse calcium that triggers the initiation of asynchronous release. This novel calcium source for asynchronous release predicts many of the central features for this mode including sensitivity to calcium buffers, persistence following termination of the stimulus, and non-phase locking to the presynaptic action potential."

                        "text": "Paired patch clamp recordings from the caudal primary motor neuron (CaP) and target fast skeletal muscle showed a stereotypic transition from exclusively synchronous to principally asynchronous transmission when stimulated at frequencies greater than 20 Hz (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wen et al., 2010</a>). Behaviorally evoked contractures of zebrafish axial muscle correspond to frequencies between 20 Hz and 100 Hz, so we continue to use the latter stimulus frequency as the benchmark for our studies. At 100 Hz, greater than 95% of the synaptic responses were phase locked to the presynaptic action potential during the first second of stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A1,B</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wen et al., 2010</a>). The onset of asynchronous release occurred after the first second of stimulation, displaying a time-dependent increase in overall contribution during the ensuing stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A2,B</a>). The release was quantitated as charge transfer by integrating the EPCs for each consecutive second of the stimulation, and synchronous and asynchronous events were separated on the basis of their timing to the action potential (<a href=\"#bib26\">Wen et al., 2010</a>). The release associated with synchronous vs asynchronous events showed a time-dependent transition, and overall each of the two modes accounted for approximately half of the total synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wen et al., 2010</a>). The amplitudes of the asynchronous events were indistinguishable from the spontaneous synaptic events measured in the absence of stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), consistent with each representing individual quanta. The synchronous release is strictly dependent on P/Q-type calcium channel function (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Wen et al., 2013</a>). Inhibiting P/Q calcium channels with 1 \u00b5M \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA nearly abolished synchronous release (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D1,E</a>). Unexpectedly, asynchronous release remained intact in the \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA treated fish, but with a greatly delayed onset compared to the control fish (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D2,E</a>). Quantitatively, over 85% of release seen in \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA fish was associated with the asynchronous mode, and this likely represents an underestimate because of the resolution of our analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Similar to the control, the amplitude of the asynchronous events was indistinguishable from spontaneous miniature events (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The motility mutant line <i>tb204a</i> has greatly compromised P/Q calcium channel function but is not a complete null (<a href=\"#bib28\">Wen et al., 2013</a>). Accordingly, the synchronous release was reduced but not eliminated completely (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G1</a>), leaving asynchronous release intact (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G2</a>). Quantitation of the time-dependent contributions showed both reduced synchronous release and delayed onset of asynchronous release for <i>tb204a</i> compared to control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Once again, the amplitude of the late asynchronous event class was indistinguishable from the spontaneous events measured in the absence of stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>), as well as those asynchronous events recorded from control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA-treated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) fish."

For this purpose, we recorded stimulus-driven fluorescence changes in a transgenic line of fish expressing synaptopHluorin in the spinal motor neurons. Exocytosis was signaled by an increase in fluorescence that results from exposure of the vesicular synaptopHluorin protein to neutral pH (<a href=\"#bib18\">Miesenbock et al., 1998</a>). Fluorescence was monitored in a single image plane that was selected prior to stimulation on the basis of distribution and number of boutons. For this purpose each CaP neuron was filled with the fluorescent Alexa Fluor 647 dye via the patch pipette (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, fill). Stimulation of CaP motor neurons for 10 s at 100 Hz resulted in a robust fluorescence increase that was largely restricted to the boutons associated with synapses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, spH). The synaptic location of the regions of interest (ROIs) was determined by means of the postsynaptic receptor label \u03b1\u2212bungarotoxin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, \u03b1-btx and overlay). Next, stimulus-driven changes in synaptopHluorin fluorescence were determined. Images were captured at 33 ms intervals in a single plane that contained candidate ROIs. Post stimulus, images were corrected by background subtraction and then each ROI was quantitated as the ratio of delta fluorescence to prestimulus fluorescence (\u0394F/F<sub>0</sub>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This corrects for the expression of the pHluorin on the surface and in subcellular compartments other than vesicles. The fluorescence for control ROIs rose immediately at the start of 100 Hz stimulation and reached a plateau during the subsequent few seconds of stimulation (gray traces, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, the fluorescence signal in \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA-treated neurons showed greatly delayed onset of fluorescence for comparable ROIs (color traces, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Additionally, the synaptopHluorin signal was reduced in the \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Comparisons of the onset of fluorescence increase for overall ROIs were made by measuring the time required to reach 50% maximal intensity from the initiation of stimulation. The distribution showed non-overlapping values for control and \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These data agree well with those obtained by paired recordings showing delayed onset of asynchronous synaptic transmission in the absence of P/Q type calcium channel function (<a href=\"#fig1 fig2\">Figures 1 and 2</a>)."

Fluorescence change was determined for each ROI and expressed as the ratio of the green fluorescence jump (\u0394G, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal) to red fluorescence (R, fill). This method allowed us to normalize the fluorescence change to differences in cell volume (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>). In control neurons, \u0394G/R within the axon initial segment and distal boutons showed no significant difference in the timing of signal onset (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). By contrast, in fish treated with \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA, the fluorescent signal onset was delayed for all regions except the axon initial segment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Moreover, the delay was longer with greater distance from the soma (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>).

However, it was necessary to exclude the possibility that the calcium indicator was competing with the endogenous calcium handling in the cell. To address this possibility, we compared two calcium indicators, 100 \u03bcM Fluo-4 (k<sub>d</sub> = 345 nM) to 100 \u03bcM Fluo-5F (k<sub>d</sub> = 2.3 \u00b5M), which have approximately sevenfold different binding constants for calcium (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Comparisons were made on the basis of the onset of calcium signal in the boutons in both control and \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish. With both Fluo-4 and Fluo-5F the time to 20% rise was significantly longer in \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA treated fish compared to control fish (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Importantly, there was no significant difference between the dyes in \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

For this purpose each motor neuron was reconstructed as a three-dimensional image using Imaris filament software on the basis of the dye fill (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). A 63\u00d7 objective was substituted to obtain greater detail of the synaptic boutons resulting in exclusion of the soma from the field of view. Therefore, a reference point for distance zero was chosen that was approximately 80 \u03bcm from the soma where the axon has traversed the notochord (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, arrow head). The time-dependent changes in fluorescence were first determined for a series of ROIs corresponding to hot spots at different distances from the reference point (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). The rise in fluorescence was delayed with greater distance from the soma (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). When expressed as time to 20% rise vs distance from the reference point, a striking quasi-linear relationship was observed for the boutons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This relationship was determined for all of the recordings performed in \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA-treated neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>).

For example, the delayed appearance of calcium in the distal boutons might reflect a slower rise in free calcium due to greater calcium handling at the boutons. The calcium signals shown in <a href=\"#fig5 fig7\">Figures 5 and 7</a> suggest that such differences may exist. The signal in the axon initiation zone does not decline during maintained stimulation, whereas the distal signal appears to relax slightly during the stimulation. To test whether slow time-dependent calcium accumulation could account for the delayed rise in distal terminals, paired recordings were made using a \u2018killswitch\u2019 protocol. The stimulation was terminated either prior to (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) or coincident with (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) the onset of asynchronous release in \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish. In seven such recordings with 5 mM intracellular EGTA, the asynchronous release persisted well beyond termination of the stimulus. To test whether the calcium signal also persists after stimulus termination, we used the killswitch protocol during calcium imaging in the presence of 1 \u00b5M \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA. The calcium signal, measured using Fluo-4 in the presence of 0.5 mM EGTA, also exhibited distance-dependent onset with the signal in the distal boutons peaking following termination of the stimulus (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Because the stimulus was terminated prematurely in both paired recordings and calcium measurements, continued accumulation would not occur and could not account for the delayed onset of asynchronous release and the calcium signal. Instead, the findings strongly support the involvement of a propagating calcium signal that was triggered by stimulation at the soma."

For \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish, calcium measurement from ROIs corresponding to boutons showed two to threefold greater delay in signal onset with 5 mM EGTA (red) compared to 0.5 mM EGTA (blue, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

At both the EGTA concentrations, the arrival of the calcium signal in the axonal regions appeared to be independent of distance from the stimulation, despite the large differences in onset time. These data are indicative of a faster velocity of travel along these regions of the neuron.

The studies on CNS neurons generally ascribe asynchronous release to persistent calcium resulting from opening of the highly localized presynaptic calcium channels (<a href=\"#bib13\">Goda and Stevens, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cummings et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Atluri and Regehr, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen and Regehr, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Lu and Trussell, 2000</a>). At the zebrafish NMJ, this would be the \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive P/Q type calcium channel that is essential for synchronous release (<a href=\"#bib28\">Wen et al., 2013</a>). We tested this idea using paired recordings by either eliminating presynaptic calcium entry through blockade with \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA or by means of a mutant line (<i>tb204a</i>) with functionally compromised P/Q type calcium channels (<a href=\"#bib28\">Wen et al., 2013</a>). We found that a greatly delayed asynchronous component was still present under conditions where the synchronous release calcium channel was eliminated. Using calcium indicator dyes we identified a source of calcium for asynchronous release that, under conditions of P/Q type calcium channel inhibition, originated in the axons and branch points and appeared to propagate into the synaptic boutons. The delayed arrival into the distal boutons, sites of synaptic interaction based on \u03b1-btx labeling, accounted well for the delayed onset of asynchronous release. Moreover, paired recordings performed along with calcium imaging confirmed the coincidence between the arrival of the calcium signal and the onset of delayed asynchronous synaptic transmission."

This rank order was inversely related to the levels of P/Q type channel function, pointing to a likely contribution by these channels to asynchronous release as well. Accordingly, the early onset of asynchronous release in control recordings, compared to \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish, would result from the combined action of the local calcium entry and calcium arrival from a distal source. The synergistic action is fully compromised in \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish but only partially compromised in mutant fish. A model with separate, but interactive calcium sources, challenges the prevailing view that asynchronous release results exclusively from an expansion of the highly restricted calcium domains surrounding the same calcium channels that govern synchronous release (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borst and Sakmann, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Meinrenken et al., 2002</a>). This model would predict that blocking the source of calcium for synchronous release would also inhibit the asynchronous release. Support for an expanding domain comes principally from the differential sensitivity of synchronous vs asynchronous release to slow calcium buffers (<a href=\"#bib20\">Neher, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Eggermann et al., 2012</a>). The slow calcium buffer EGTA obliterates asynchronous release at concentrations that are ineffective on synchronous release (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adler et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cummings et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Atluri and Regehr, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Lu and Trussell, 2000</a>). By contrast, blockade of synchronous release generally requires use of the fast buffer BAPTA (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adler et al., 1991</a>). Augustine notes that \u2018this criteria has been used successfully to probe local calcium signaling with the conclusion that high BAPTA/EGTA efficacy points toward nanodomain and equal efficacy implicates diffuse calcium signals or microdomains\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Augustine et al., 2003</a>), an approach widely used as a determinant of calcium channel-calcium sensor coupling (<a href=\"#bib10\">Eggermann et al., 2011</a>). It is the case with zebrafish NMJ that asynchronous release, as well as the calcium propagation, is highly sensitive to the slow buffer EGTA. We interpret these findings to mean that in zebrafish the differential sensitivity reflects, to a large extent, the involvement of bulk cytoplasmic changes stemming from distal calcium as opposed solely to highly restricted calcium domains entering through the P/Q type calcium channels. This provides an alternative interpretation to the BAPTA/EGTA sensitivity metric but does not exclude additional contribution by the expanding zone of calcium formed by local P/Q channel openings."

The pharmacological results point to no clear source of either intracellular or extracellular calcium as required for the initiation or propagation. Effects seen using the calcium channel blockers, Mibefradil, Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Nimodipine suggest that activation of calcium channels is involved, but the pharmacological profile does not fit any specific isoform. One impression resulting from these experiments is that the propagation is so potent in the branch points and locations near boutons, that there may be a large safety factor that requires near extinction of calcium before propagation is terminated. In this case, the pharmacological block would have to be nearly complete before the calcium propagation was inhibited. Our results from TTX experiments provide some insights into the process of calcium propagation. In the absence of action potentials, Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation can be elicited with prolonged depolarization, but the apparent velocity is slow. These data are compatible with a model in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation is less dependent on coordination by the action potential in the boutons than in the axons. Accordingly, an action potential traveling down the axon would instantaneously initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation at the branching point, whereas the spread of depolarization would take much longer in the presence of TTX. The pharmacological conditions under which the calcium propagation is best revealed are non-physiological. Instead, the distance over which calcium needs to propagate under physiological conditions is certainly less due to participation of the action potential. Additionally, as pointed out earlier the P/Q channels do participate in the calcium generation and the secondary sources for calcium are also near the boutons, minimizing the need for long distance propagation. However, all evidence points to a central involvement of this secondary source of calcium in the delayed onset of asynchronous release."

Published accounts of propagating calcium signals like those shown in our study have been largely limited to postsynaptic cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ross, 2012</a>). However, there is some precedence for ryanodine-sensitive calcium stores involvement in synaptic transmission at guinea pig sympathetic nerve terminals and frog NMJ (<a href=\"#bib23\">Smith and Cunnane, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Narita et al., 1998</a>). Our findings take on additional significance due to our ability to assign a functional role to this secondary source of calcium. Consequently, we have a clearer understanding of the delayed onset and persistent release properties associated with asynchronous release. In light of the ubiquitous nature of asynchronous release, it will be critical to determine whether similar mechanisms are at work at synapses within the central nervous system."

Live confocal images were acquired using a Yokogawa CSU-10 spinning disc (Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan) with a Stanford Photonics 620 Turbo ICCD camera (Stanford Photonics, Palo Alto, CA). The laser lines used included an Argon 488 nm (DLS2000, Dynamic Laser, Salt Lake City, UT), 561 nm (Sapphire 561-50 CW CDRH, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) and 640 nm (Chromalase II diode laser, Blue Sky Research, Milpitas, CA). Low power images that included the entire CaP motor neuron utilized the Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 40\u00d7/1.0 n.a. dip objective, whereas higher resolution of the bouton field was obtained with the 63x equivalent objective. The CaP motor neuron was also co-loaded with 40 \u03bcM Alexa Fluor 647 hydrazide (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) to identify the boutons and perform morphological reconstructions. For paired recordings with simultaneous calcium imaging, muscle was filled with 40 \u03bcM Alexa Fluor 555 hydrazide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For each synaptopHluorin or calcium indicator recording, an acquisition plane was selected to contain 10\u201315 synaptic boutons in the field. Sequential images were acquired continuously at 33 ms intervals during 100 Hz stimulation. The calcium signals for each bouton were baseline subtracted, and the ratio of stimulus induced increase in calcium signal (green) to fill signal (red) was computed for regions of interest (ROIs). Images were acquired with Piper Control 2.5.04 (Stanford Photonics, Palo Alto, CA) and analyzed with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD), Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA) and custom scripts in Igor Pro 6.3 (Lake Oswego, OR). Unlike the calcium images taken in a single plane, images of the Alexa Fluor 647 filled motor neuron were acquired before and after the end of the experiment using 50\u201370 1 \u00b5m steps (Mipos 100SG piezo driver; Piezosystems Jena, Jena, Germany) to create stacks for the purpose of full morphological determination. The dye filled CaP motor neuron was reconstructed using Imaris filament software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) after completion of the calcium imaging."

When P/Q-type Ca channels are blocked with conotoxin, presynaptic activity still results in neurotransmitter release, but after an extremely long delay. A nice set of electrophysiology and imaging experiments make it pretty convincing that this unexpected phenomenon is real, and involves strangely delayed calcium rises in response to activity. It raises the possibility that this phenomenon could exist at other synapses, which makes it interesting. On the down side, the properties of this phenomenon are only sketched in here, with a lot of loose ends, and the exposition is somewhat disordered. Furthermore, the terminology presumes identity of this phenomenon with other established phenomena such as delayed release and calcium waves, even though there is little evidence to support this. These weaknesses detract from what is otherwise an interesting observation, quite worthy of more thorough investigation. Minimally, substantial editorial changes in the text, figures, and data analysis are required. It is possible that some additional experiments will be needed, or addition of further data already in place in the laboratory may suffice."

First, calling this \u201cdelayed\u201d or \u201casynchronous\u201d release is confusing. Delayed release at conventional central synapses is the desynchronized release of individual quanta following calcium influx at synapses, and is driven to a large extent by residual calcium. This phenomenon studied here may be different in important ways. It is difficult to tell from the figures whether these are individual quanta, since they seem to be very large currents. Perhaps enlarging and analyzing the traces in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> would help. What is the quantal size at this synapse? Are these multiple quanta releasing simultaneously, or are quanta actually 1-2 nA? Secondly, the authors argue that this calcium influx is not through normal synaptic calcium channels, so tying this phenomenon to delayed release seems unnecessary. Second, the release follows an elevation in intracellular calcium that is referred to as a \u201cwave\u201d. This term brings to mind the spontaneous, repetitive activity seen in developing cochlea and retina. However, the phenomenon studied here is not clearly spontaneous or repetitive, so it would be preferable to avoid using the loaded term \u201cwave\u201d. I think this phenomenon is quite interesting enough on its own terms to avoid the confusion associated with those established phenomena, until it can be clearly linked to them. It seems adequate to call it \u201cpropagating\u201d, as for example an action potential is."
