                    "text": "The widely accepted model of G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle progression proposes that cyclin D:Cdk4/6 inactivates the Rb tumor suppressor during early G<sub>1</sub> phase by progressive multi-phosphorylation, termed hypo-phosphorylation, to release E2F transcription factors. However, this model remains unproven biochemically and the biologically active form(s) of Rb remains unknown. In this study, we find that Rb is exclusively mono-phosphorylated in early G<sub>1</sub> phase by cyclin D:Cdk4/6. Mono-phosphorylated Rb is composed of 14 independent isoforms that are all targeted by the E1a oncoprotein, but show preferential E2F binding patterns. At the late G<sub>1</sub> Restriction Point, cyclin E:Cdk2 inactivates Rb by quantum hyper-phosphorylation. Cells undergoing a DNA damage response activate cyclin D:Cdk4/6 to generate mono-phosphorylated Rb that regulates global transcription, whereas cells undergoing differentiation utilize un-phosphorylated Rb. These observations fundamentally change our understanding of G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle progression and show that mono-phosphorylated Rb, generated by cyclin D:Cdk4/6, is the only Rb isoform in early G<sub>1</sub> phase."

However, this model remains unproven biochemically and the biologically active form(s) of Rb remains unknown. In this study, we find that Rb is exclusively mono-phosphorylated in early G<sub>1</sub> phase by cyclin D:Cdk4/6. Mono-phosphorylated Rb is composed of 14 independent isoforms that are all targeted by the E1a oncoprotein, but show preferential E2F binding patterns. At the late G<sub>1</sub> Restriction Point, cyclin E:Cdk2 inactivates Rb by quantum hyper-phosphorylation. Cells undergoing a DNA damage response activate cyclin D:Cdk4/6 to generate mono-phosphorylated Rb that regulates global transcription, whereas cells undergoing differentiation utilize un-phosphorylated Rb. These observations fundamentally change our understanding of G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle progression and show that mono-phosphorylated Rb, generated by cyclin D:Cdk4/6, is the only Rb isoform in early G<sub>1</sub> phase."

However, the Rb gene is infrequently mutated or deleted, instead upstream pathways that regulate Rb by phosphorylation on Cdk sites are altered in the majority of human cancers, including deletion and mutation of the p16 tumor suppressor and upregulation and mutation of cyclin D1, D2, D3, Cdk4 and Cdk6 genes (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sherr and McCormick, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Knudsen and Knudsen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Henley and Dick, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Choi and Anders, 2013</a>).

Likewise, supra-physiologic overexpression studies using Rb constructs where many, but not all, of the putative Cdk Ser/Thr consensus sites were mutated to Ala residues resulted in repressed E2F-dependent transcription and cell cycle arrest, as did overexpression of Cdk inhibitors, p16, p21, and p27 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sherr, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Knudsen and Wang, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Leng et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sherr and McCormick, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Knudsen and Knudsen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Paternot et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Henley and Dick, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Choi and Anders, 2013</a>). Collectively, over the last 20 years, these studies have led to a widely accepted model of G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle progression that proposes cyclin D:Cdk4/6 inactivates Rb during early G<sub>1</sub> phase by progressive multi-phosphorylation, termed \u2018hypo-phosphorylation\u2019, resulting in release of E2F transcription factors that induce expression of cyclin E, resulting in activation of cyclin E:Cdk2 complexes that complete Rb inactivation by hyper-phosphorylation in late G<sub>1</sub> phase. The key tenet of this model is the progressive multi-phosphorylating, hypo-phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes; however, the putative hypo-phosphorylated Rb and un-phosphorylated Rb co-migrate on 1D SDS-PAGE and cannot be separated (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ezhevsky et al., 2001</a>). Moreover, there is no biochemical data defining the extent or timing of phosphorylation that constitutes hypo-phosphorylated Rb. Consequently, it remains entirely unknown if hypo-phosphorylated Rb contains one, two, three, five, seven or more phosphates and at what phosphate number does the putative hypo-phosphorylated Rb become inactive to release E2F transcription factors. Thus, the critical core tenet of the G<sub>1</sub> model that cyclin D:Cdk4/6 inactivates Rb by progressive multi-phosphorylation or hypo-phosphorylation remains unproven biochemically."

In fact, we only observed induction of E2F target genes upon the activation of cyclin E:Cdk2 complexes and the appearance of hyper-phosphorylated Rb. These observations questioned the core biological consequences of cyclin D:Cdk4/6 progressive hypo-phosphorylation of Rb during early G<sub>1</sub> phase. Here, for the first time, we separated all Rb isoforms by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing (2D IEF) and find that Rb is exclusively mono-phosphorylated in early G<sub>1</sub> phase in both normal and p16-deficient tumor cells. We found no experimental evidence to support the notion of progressive multi-phosphorylating hypo-phosphorylation of Rb. Using Cdk4/6-specific inhibitors and triple cyclin D-deleted MEFs, we determined that cyclin D:Cdk4/6 is the Rb mono-phosphorylating kinase that generates 14 independent mono-phosphorylated Rb isoforms in early G<sub>1</sub> phase. At the late G<sub>1</sub> Restriction Point, activation of cyclin E:Cdk2 complexes perform a quantum hyper-phosphorylating inactivation of all mono-phosphorylated Rb isoforms. Cells undergoing a DNA damage response activate cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes to generate active mono-phosphorylated Rb that regulates global transcription, whereas cells exiting the cell cycle use un-phosphorylated Rb. Together, our observations demonstrate that mono-phosphorylated Rb, generated by cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes, is the functionally active Rb isoform present in early G<sub>1</sub> phase."

Analysis of synchronized primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) arrested in early G<sub>1</sub> phase by contact inhibition in the presence of serum and released by replating at low density progressed through early G<sub>1</sub> phase with constitutively active cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes and no evidence for increased Rb phosphorylation or transcriptional induction of Cdc6, a key E2F target gene repressed by active Rb (<a href=\"#bib42\">Morris and Dyson, 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In contrast, Cdc6 was induced ten-fold upon cyclin E:Cdk2 activation and Rb hyper-phosphorylation, which migrates more slowly on 1D SDS-PAGE. However, the putative hypo-phosphorylated Rb isoforms co-migrated as a single fastest migrating species during all of the early G<sub>1</sub> phase time points (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Thus, there is either no evidence for progressive hypo-phosphorylation of Rb and/or 1D SDS-PAGE is not capable of separating all Rb phospho-isoforms."

Therefore, we utilized 2D IEF to ascertain the extent and kinetics of the putative progressive multi-phosphorylated hypo-phosphorylation of Rb during early G<sub>1</sub> phase. First, we calibrated the 2D IEF by generating a non-phosphorylatable Rb construct (\u0394Cdk Rb) standard where 15 of the 16 putative Cdk sites were converted to Ala residues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), plus we added an N-terminal HA tag. We left S567 unaltered because it is buried in the central core of Rb's A-box and solvent inaccessible (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 1998</a>). The isoelectric point of un-phosphorylated Rb is 8.1, and 2D IEF of the \u0394Cdk Rb construct expressed in asynchronous cycling cells focused as a single basic species with a pI \u223c8 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), confirming that Rb is only phosphorylated on Cdk sites and that S567 is not phosphorylated in vivo."

We examined four disparate human tumor cell lines that express wild-type Rb, and are deleted for the p16 tumor suppressor gene, a specific inhibitor of Cdk4/6.

Together, these results present several significant insights into the biochemical properties of Rb phosphorylation in vivo. First, G<sub>0</sub>-arrested cells contain un-phosphorylated Rb. Second, Rb from both cycling normal and p16-deleted tumor cells is only mono-phosphorylated or hyper-phosphorylated in vivo.

Likewise, immunoprecipitation of S608 mono-phosphorylated Rb was only recognized by the S608 phospho-specific antibody and not by the other phospho-specific antibodies. In contrast, immunoprecipitated hyper-phosphorylated Rb from S phase arrested HFF cells with either the T826 or S608 phospho-specific antibodies was recognized by multiple phospho-specific antibodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), supporting the presence of multiple phosphates on individual hyper-phosphorylated Rb molecules. To identify the extent of mono-phosphorylated Rb isoforms, we generated all 15 individual single Cdk site Rb constructs. 2D IEFs on each of the single Cdk site Rb constructs expressed in cells determined that 14 of the single Cdk site Rb constructs were mono-phosphorylated in vivo (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

To test this hypothesis, we independently co-transfected each single Cdk site mono-phosphorylated Rb-HA construct and control un-phosphorylatable \u0394Cdk Rb-HA into cells co-expressing the E1a oncoprotein or E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3, E2F-4 transcription factors (Myc tagged), then individually immunoprecipitated E1a and each E2F, and immunoblotted for the associated Rb mono-phosphorylated isoforms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Parental MEFs expressing endogenous Rb, Rb-deleted MEFS, and Rb-deleted MEFS expressing either WT Rb-HA or \u0394Cdk Rb-HA were contact arrested in early G<sub>1</sub> phase (+FBS) and released for 4 hr, then treated with a sub-lethal dose of doxorubicin (100 ng/ml) for 3 hr and analyzed for whole genome transcriptional changes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Rb is a transcriptional repressor and Rb-deleted MEFs showed a &gt;1.6x increase in expression of 173 genes, primarily involved in DNA replication (24%), cell cycle control (20%), and regulation of transcription (18%) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Expression of physiologic levels of mono-phosphorylated WT Rb-HA in Rb-deleted cells restored repression of many of these genes, especially E2F target genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, expression of un-phosphorylated \u0394Cdk Rb-HA at physiologic levels failed to repress genes and gave a pattern of global transcriptional deregulation similar to Rb-deleted MEFs, suggesting that un-phosphorylated Rb was functionally inactive during a DNA damage response checkpoint during early G<sub>1</sub> phase. Further qRT-PCR analysis of two strong E2F target genes, DHFR and cdc6, showed similar levels of deregulation in both Rb-deleted and un-phosphorylated \u0394Cdk Rb-HA MEFs, whereas WT Rb-HA repressed both of these genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013G</a>). A non-Rb regulated gene, p21, showed no difference between all three genotypes. Rb-deleted (Rb<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>) MEFs also failed to prevent the appearance of tetraploid cells several days after treatment with either doxorubicin or ionizing radiation (20 Grays) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>). Consistent with the inability to regulate transcriptional control, un-phosphorylated \u0394Cdk Rb-HA MEFs showed similar high levels of tetraploid cells in response to DNA damage as Rb-deleted (Rb<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>) MEFs. In contrast, WT Rb-HA expression rescued the tetraploid phenotype to levels near parental MEFs expressing endogenous wild type Rb (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>). These observations demonstrated that cells undergoing a DNA damage response activate cyclin D:Cdk4/6 to generate biologically active, mono-phosphorylated Rb, whereas un-phosphorylated was functionally inactive for regulating E2F transcription and preventing the appearance of tetraploid cells."

However, serum-deprived G<sub>0</sub> arrested HFFs and U2OS cells contained un-phosphorylated Rb (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,G</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), as do quiescent G<sub>0</sub> peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ezhevsky et al., 2001</a>). Moreover, other studies have documented a role for Rb in cell cycle exit and differentiation, including proper myogenic development as myoblasts exit the cell cycle into G<sub>0</sub> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gu et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zacksenhaus et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chen and Wang, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sage et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blais et al., 2007</a>). Together, these observations suggested a potential functional role for un-phosphorylated Rb during cell cycle exit and differentiation. To evaluate the phosphorylation status of Rb during differentiation, we used the well-established C2C12 myoblast to myotube differentiation system (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blais et al., 2005</a>). Asynchronous cycling C2C12 myoblasts grown in high mitogen media (FBS) contained both mono-phosphorylated Rb and hyper-phosphorylated Rb with no detectable un-phosphorylated Rb (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). However, addition of low mitogen, differentiation media induced expression of myotube specific myogenin and resulted in the exclusive presence of un-phosphorylated Rb at day 2, concomitant with loss of cyclin D:Cdk4/6 kinase activity and expression of p18, a Cdk4/6-specific inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib22\">Halevy et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Franklin and Xiong, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wang and Walsh, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013D</a>). We also observed the exclusive appearance of un-phosphorylated Rb when human HL60 promyelocytic cells were induced to undergo differentiation by addition of retinoic acid (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>)."

Endogenous Rb from C2C12 myoblasts was knocked down by shRb or control shScramble (Scr) RNAi retroviruses, followed by retroviral physiologic expression of WT Rb-HA or \u0394Cdk Rb-HA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). As per the method of <a href=\"#bib4\">Blais et al. (2007)</a>, the efficiency of cell cycle exit was evaluated 2 days post-addition of low mitogen differentiation media by counting the number of nuclei (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F\u2013H</a>). Reduction of Rb levels by shRNAi resulted in an increased proliferation index (number of nuclei), and increased expression of Mcm3 and Mcm5 (markers of DNA replication) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). However, physiologic expression of WT Rb-HA compensated for the reduction in endogenous Rb by bringing the proliferation index back to the shScrambled RNAi control. Strikingly, physiologic expression of \u0394Cdk Rb-HA resulted in a dramatic reduction of proliferation as cells prematurely exited the cell cycle and decreased Mcm3 and Mcm5 levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F\u2013H</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Thus, in contrast to the DNA damage response where un-phosphorylated Rb was non-functional, these observations demonstrated that un-phosphorylated Rb was functionally active to drive cell cycle exit and differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes."

This notion was reinforced when tumor cells expressing wild-type Rb were found to have genetic and epigenetic alterations of the p16 tumor suppressor gene or oncogenic expression of cyclin D1, D2, D3, Cdk4, and Cdk6 genes, which became known as the \u2018p16-cyclin D-Rb\u2019 pathway (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sherr, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sherr and McCormick, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Paternot et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Henley and Dick, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Choi and Anders, 2013</a>). Further reinforcing this notion were experiments utilizing supra-physiologic overexpression of D-type cyclins and Cdk4/Cdk6 that inactivated Rb and drove cells into S phase. Likewise, experiments overexpressing p16, a Cdk4/6 inhibitor, arrested cells in a 2n DNA content and were interpreted to confirm the notion that cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes inactivated Rb. Moreover, the large number of tryptic phospho-peptides of \u2018hypo-phosphorylated\u2019 Rb from early G<sub>1</sub> cells reported by <a href=\"#bib41\">Mittnacht et al. (1994)</a> was unknowingly misinterpreted and further reinforced the notion that cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes inactivate Rb by progressive multi-phosphorylating, hypo-phosphorylation. Although there was a complete absence of rigorous biochemical evidence as to the extent of phosphate numbers or kinetics on what was loosely termed hypo-phosphorylated Rb, the notion that cyclin D:Cdk4/6 inactivated Rb by progressive multi-phosphorylating, hypo-phosphorylation was solidified in the 1990s as the model of G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle progression."

                        "text": "In sharp contrast to the prevailing model, we had previously performed kinetic analyses from highly synchronized normal cells and p16-deficient tumor cells, and found that cyclin D:Cdk4/6 was constitutively active throughout all of the early G<sub>1</sub> phase at the same time points that Rb was actively binding E2Fs and repressing E2F target gene expression (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ezhevsky et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Haberichter et al., 2007</a>). Consequently, we suspected that cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes were not inactivating Rb, but may, in fact, be activating Rb by phosphorylation. The key to understanding the relationship between Rb and cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes was developing the ability to quantitatively separate all Rb isoforms by 2D IEF combined with the generation of Rb phosphorylation standards. During the course of this study, we performed hundreds of 2D IEFs on Rb from 11 independent normal and tumorigenic cell types under conditions of asynchronous cycling cells, cells arrested in G<sub>0</sub>, early G<sub>1</sub>, late G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub>/M phases, and cells that were arrested/released and followed kinetically. Under all of these conditions and cell types, we found that Rb was exclusively mono-phosphorylated throughout all of early G<sub>1</sub> phase in both normal and tumor cells, and hyper-phosphorylated in late G<sub>1</sub>, S, G<sub>2</sub>, and M phases. In fact, we found no biochemical evidence to support the prevailing G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle model that cyclin D:Cdk4/6 progressively hypo-phosphorylates Rb. Moreover, using three independent approaches to dissect cyclin D:Cdk4/6 function on Rb, namely: triple cyclin D genetic deletion, addition of a Cdk4/6-specific chemical inhibitor, and p16 expression, we determined that cyclin D:Cdk4/6 is the Rb mono-phosphorylating kinase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Given that mono-phosphorylated Rb is the only isoform of Rb present in early G<sub>1</sub> phase, by definition, some, most or all of the mono-phosphorylated Rb isoforms must be biologically active. Consequently, it was not too surprising that mono-phosphorylated Rb was the active Rb isoform mediating a DNA damage response cell cycle arrest and regulating global transcription. However, we note the unanticipated observation that exposure of quiescent G<sub>0</sub> (\u2212FBS) primary cells, containing no cyclin D:Cdk4/6 activity, to DNA damaging agents induced and activated cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes to mono-phosphorylate Rb in the absence of serum growth factors. This observation is consistent with a role for cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes in the DNA damage response checkpoint (<a href=\"#bib9\">Choi et al., 2012</a>), but also raises a cautionary concern for a potential increase of genomic DNA damage in the normal cells of patients being simultaneously treated with a cyclin D:Cdk4/6 inhibitor and a DNA damaging chemotherapy or ionizing radiation."

Although the complete structure of Rb has yet to be solved, several groups have recently solved the core structure as an intra-strand pseudo-dimer of dimers with the Cdk sites present on loops between structured regions or on the C-terminus abutting the B-box (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lamber et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Based on the binding preferences of individual Rb mono-phosphorylated isoforms to specific E2F transcription factors, our data suggest that the generation of 14 mono-phosphorylated Rb isoforms may serve as a mechanism to post-translationally functionally diversify Rb in early G<sub>1</sub> phase from a single un-phosphorylated isoform in G<sub>0</sub>. In addition to E2F transcription factors, Rb has also been shown to bind to over 100 additional cellular proteins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Morris and Dyson, 2001</a>), leaving open the potential for differential binding preferences of mono-phosphorylated Rb to specific cellular targets. Excluding hyper-phosphorylated Rb, we were surprised at the complete absence of any multi-phosphorylated Rb isoforms. This raised the mechanistic question of how does cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes place one, and only one, phosphate on Rb while leaving the remaining 13 Cdk sites un-phosphorylated? While this will require extensive structural analyses beyond the scope of our study, we speculate that the substrate recognition of Rb by cyclin D's N-terminal LxCxE motif weak binding to Rb's pocket domain (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dowdy et al., 1993</a>) vs cyclins E and A avid binding to four C-terminal R/KxL substrate motifs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 1999</a>) outside of the pocket likely serves as the defining mechanism between Rb mono-phosphorylation and Rb hyper-phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In this hypothesis, cyclin E/A:Cdk2's strong binding to the C-terminal tail of Rb would allow access to all 14 Cdk sites on Rb even when transcription factors and chromatin remodeling factors were bound to Rb's pocket and N-terminal binding sites. This also allows for a simultaneous switch-like inactivation of all 14 mono-phosphorylated Rb isoforms by one processive hyper-phosphorylation mechanism. We believe that the utilization of the same phosphorylation sites for the activation and inactivation of a protein, albeit with a &gt;12-fold increased phosphate stoichiometry, is an unprecedented mechanism in the literature, but one that also likely applies to Rb-related genes p107 and p130."

The results presented here fundamentally change the understanding of G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle regulation to show that cyclin D:Cdk4/6 activates Rb for binding cellular targets during early G<sub>1</sub> phase by generating 14 independent mono-phosphorylated Rb isoforms. Given that the majority of human tumors contain wild-type Rb, but select for deregulated cyclin D:Cdk4/6 activity (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sherr and McCormick, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Knudsen and Knudsen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Choi and Anders, 2013</a>), we hypothesize that the oncogenic activation of cyclin D:Cdk4/6 results in Rb mono-phosphorylation to drive quiescent G<sub>0</sub> cells into a more metabolically active, but early G<sub>1</sub> phase arrested phenotype (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). By constitutively mono-phosphorylating Rb, the nascent neoplastic cell avoids cell cycle exit and differentiation mediated by un-phosphorylated Rb, and also maintains a high level of metabolism. This notion is entirely consistent with the observed subtle and highly tolerated cancer predisposing mutations of p16 deletion and cyclin D overexpression in mouse models that avoid activation of oncogene-induced apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</a>). The net effect is a subtle, but irreversible, oncogenic step forward. While our study determined the role of cyclin D:Cdk4/6 in mono-phosphorylating Rb, it leaves wide open the question of what the rate-limiting switch-like mechanism is to activate cyclin E:Cdk2, the first domino in Rb inactivation. Cyclin D:Cdk4/6 activity combined with other signal transduction pathway mutations contributes to increased cellular metabolism that we speculate is monitored by an unknown metabolic sensor. Once the metabolic threshold has been exceeded, the sensor activates cyclin E:Cdk2 resulting in Rb inactivation by hyper-phosphorylation, induction of E2F target gene transcription and progression across the Restriction Point into late G<sub>1</sub> phase (<a href=\"#bib21\">Haberichter et al., 2007</a>). We are currently investigating the mechanics of this putative mechanism and the identity of the metabolic sensor."

Their data suggest that pRb is activated in G1 phase by cyclinD/CDK dependent mono-phosphorylation at one of 14 CDK sites. Hyper-phosphorylation by cyclinE/CDK inactivates pRb to fully activate E2F-dependent transcription, which surprisingly is independent of cyclinD/CDK mono-phosphorylation. In addition their data indicates that DNA damage induced pRb activation requires cyclinD/CDK-dependent mono-phosphorylation. Finally they present data that suggests that un-phosphorylated pRb drives cell cycle exit (G0 entry) or prevents G1 entry. Based on these results they suggest a model in which an increase in cyclinD/CDK activity, observed in many cancers, 'primes' a cell for loss of cell cycle control by preventing cell cycle exit (or allowing G1 entry). This radically changes the way we think about the role of cyclinD/CDK in the regulation of pRb function."

Cyclin D:Cdk4/6 activity combined with other signal transduction pathway mutations contributes to increased cellular metabolism that we speculate is monitored by an unknown metabolic sensor. Once the metabolic threshold has been exceeded, the sensor activates cyclin E:Cdk2 resulting in Rb inactivation by hyper-phosphorylation, induction of E2F target gene transcription and progression across the Restriction Point into late G<sub>1</sub> phase. We have expanded the Discussion section to include our thoughts on cyclin E:Cdk2 activation."

We also assert that there is no progressive multi-phosphorylating, hypo-phosphorylation of Rb. We believe that both the depth of analyses and the magnitude of impact on understanding G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle progression warrants publication in <i>eLife</i>."
