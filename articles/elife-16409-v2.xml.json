The gating mechanisms of the related TRPV2 channel are poorly understood because selective high affinity ligands are not available, and the threshold for heat activation is extremely high (&gt;50\u00b0C). Cryo-EM structures of TRPV1 and TRPV2 reveal that they adopt similar structures, and identify a putative vanilloid binding pocket near the internal side of TRPV1. Here we use biochemical and electrophysiological approaches to investigate the resiniferatoxin(RTx) binding site in TRPV1 and to explore the functional relationships between TRPV1 and TRPV2. Collectively, our results support the interaction of vanilloids with the proposed RTx binding pocket, and demonstrate an allosteric influence of a tarantula toxin on vanilloid binding. Moreover, we show that sensitivity to RTx can be engineered into TRPV2, demonstrating that the gating and permeation properties of this channel are similar to TRPV1."

The gating mechanisms of the related TRPV2 channel are poorly understood because selective high affinity ligands are not available, and the threshold for heat activation is extremely high (&gt;50\u00b0C). Cryo-EM structures of TRPV1 and TRPV2 reveal that they adopt similar structures, and identify a putative vanilloid binding pocket near the internal side of TRPV1. Here we use biochemical and electrophysiological approaches to investigate the resiniferatoxin(RTx) binding site in TRPV1 and to explore the functional relationships between TRPV1 and TRPV2. Collectively, our results support the interaction of vanilloids with the proposed RTx binding pocket, and demonstrate an allosteric influence of a tarantula toxin on vanilloid binding. Moreover, we show that sensitivity to RTx can be engineered into TRPV2, demonstrating that the gating and permeation properties of this channel are similar to TRPV1."

Like all proteins, these channels are built from smaller units called amino acids. The results from an array of approaches identified four specific amino acids that can be exchanged between TRPV1 and TRPV2 to swap their ability to bind and be activated by resiniferatoxin (a vanilloid isolated from a cactus-like plant called resin spurge). When rat TRPV2 channels were engineered to contain these four amino acids, resiniferatoxin could easily open the channel. In addition, the engineered channel allowed ions to pass through in a way that is similar to TRPV1, which suggests that the channels are more similar than previously believed."

The TRPV1 channel is one of the best studied TRP channels, and is activated by vanilloids like capsaicin from hot chili peppers, extracellular acid, the double-knot toxin (DkTx) from tarantula venom and noxious heat (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bohlen and Julius, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Julius, 2013</a>). Structures of TRPV1 have been solved by cryo-electron microscopy (EM) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Liao et al., 2013</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), revealing that the transmembrane domain of the TRP channel adopts a structure that is remarkably similar to voltage-activated potassium channels (<a href=\"#bib31\">Long et al., 2007</a>), as well inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zalk et al., 2015</a>). Protons and DkTx are known to activate TRPV1 from the external side of the pore; the residues involved in proton activation have been identified by mutagenesis (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jordt et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ryu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ryu et al., 2007</a>), and the DkTx binding site on the pore domain was initially localized by comparing apo and DkTx-bound cryo-EM structures of TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Liao et al., 2013</a>), and subsequently refined by docking the NMR structure of the toxin into the cryo-EM maps of TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</a>). A Na<sup>+</sup> ion binding site within the external pore nearby to where DkTx binds was recently shown to stabilize the closed state of TRPV1, and to be allosterically coupled with temperature-sensor activation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</a>). Thus the external pore appears to be a critical nexus for allosteric gating in TRPV1. The cryo-EM structure of TRPV1 in the presence of resiniferatoxin (RTx) revealed the presence of an additional density at the interface between the S1-S4 domains and the S5-S6 pore domains near the internal side of the membrane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>). Although this EM density is insufficient to identify where vanilloids bind, it is consistent with mutagenesis and computational studies (<a href=\"#bib11\">Elokely et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gavva et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jordt and Julius, 2002</a>)."

Indeed, the absence of high-affinity selective activators and inhibitors of TRPV2 has made exploration of this channel and its functions challenging (<a href=\"#bib41\">Peralvarez-Marin et al., 2013</a>), although the channel can be activated with low affinity by non-selective agonists such as 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Juvin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Neeper et al., 2007</a>), probenecid (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bang et al., 2007</a>) and cannabinoids (<a href=\"#bib44\">Qin et al., 2008</a>), and inhibited by ruthenium red. The TRPV2 channel is more widely expressed compared to TRPV1, and has been identified in sensory neurons, spinal cord, brain, pancreas, muscle and the immune system (<a href=\"#bib41\">Peralvarez-Marin et al., 2013</a>). Although relatively few functional deficits have been observed in TRPV2 knock-out mice other than increased perinatal lethality (<a href=\"#bib39\">Park et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Peralvarez-Marin et al., 2013</a>), the channel has been proposed to play important roles in osmosensation, mechanosensation, innate immunity and cancer (<a href=\"#bib24\">Katanosaka et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Link et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Monet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Peralvarez-Marin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shibasaki et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zanou et al., 2015</a>)."

The recent cryo-EM structure of TRPV2 reveals that the protein adopts a structure that is very similar to TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zubcevic et al., 2016</a>), suggesting that the gating mechanisms of the two TRP channels may be more similar than their distinct pharmacology and functional properties might suggest. We began by investigating whether biochemically well-behaved domains of TRPV1 could be identified that are competent to bind vanilloids such as resiniferatoxin (RTx). Although we succeeded in producing truncated constructs of TRPV1, only the full-length channel binds RTx with high affinity. We also discovered that DkTx binding to the external pore of the full-length channel can enhance the affinity of RTx, providing critical support for an allosteric model for activation of TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</a>). Using the cryo-EM structure of TRPV1 as a guide, we interrogated the putative vanilloid binding pocket with mutations in TRPV1 and our results confirm the location of the vanilloid binding site seen in the cryo-EM structure. We also attempted to engineer vanilloid sensitivity into the TRPV2 channel and made the remarkable discovery that only two mutations in TRPV2 are sufficient to enable vanilloids to bind with high affinity and to activate the channel. Single channel recordings of the vanilloid-sensitive TRPV2 channel show that high open probability (P<sub>o</sub>) can be achieved with RTx, and that the permeation properties of TRPV2 also resemble those of TRPV1."

Many of the previously identified mutants reported to alter RTx binding or capsaicin activation are localized within the S1-S4 domain of TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Elokely et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gavva et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jordt and Julius, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yang et al., 2015</a>), and in structurally related Kv channels, the S1-S4 region has been shown to form an autonomous domain (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jiang et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">2003b</a>) that is capable of imparting strong voltage-sensitivity when grafted onto relatively voltage-insensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ben-Abu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">2002</a>). We began by expressing rTRPV1 and a series of truncated constructs in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> using a previously described expression vector with a C-terminal GFP tag optimized for fluorescence-based screening of eukaryotic membrane protein expression and stability (<a href=\"#bib10\">Drew et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Parker and Newstead, 2014</a>). In addition to the full-length rTRPV1, we expressed the truncated constructs containing the N-terminus through S4 (N-S4), the N-terminus through S6 (N-S6), S1 through S6 (S1-S6) and S1 through the C-terminus (S1-C), as well as controls such as the Y511A mutant and a deletion within the outer pore (pore mutant) thought to stabilize the full-length rTRPV1 channel (<a href=\"#bib13\">Garcia-Sanz et al., 2004</a>). Crude membrane preparations of small-scale <i>S. cerevisiae</i> trials of full-length TRPV1 and truncations yielded clean, prominent bands in Tris-Glycine gels imaged with in-gel fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), indicating robust expression of the proteins without significant degradation. Constructs containing the S1-S4 or S1-S6 domains of TRPV1 displayed good monodispersity when evaluated with fluorescence-coupled size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) using a range of detergents previously used to successfully solubilize eukaryotic membrane proteins (e.g. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Although purification attempts were initially promising for the S1-S4 domain, with clear protein bands visible in elution during the first step of purification, cleavage of GFP with TEV protease led to aggregation and precipitation (not shown)."

We therefore tested whether binding of DkTx can enhance the affinity of TRPV1 for RTx, which would be predicted by an allosteric model wherein the two activators promote opening by binding more tightly to the open state. For these experiments we used a 1D4-tagged TRPV1 construct where expression in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> was driven by a constitutive promoter and we performed binding assays on yeast membranes where the vanilloid would have free access to the channel protein (see Methods). Under these conditions, we measured a K<sub>d</sub> for RTx binding to 1D4-tagged TRPV1 of 0.6 nM under control conditions, about ten\u00a0fold higher affinity than what we measured in intact cells using GFP-tagged TRPV1. When we measured the concentration-dependence of RTx binding to 1D4-tagged TRPV1 in the presence of DkTx, we observed that the tarantula toxin enhanced the affinity for RTx by about 3-fold (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The effects of DkTx were concentration-dependent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and were observed independent of whether the binding assay was performed at 37\u00b0C (our standard temperature) or at 30\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). These results demonstrate that DkTx binds to our preparation of TRPV1, and that binding of DkTx and RTx are allosterically coupled."

This analysis identified S512 (F472 in TRPV2), M547 (L507 in TRPV2), T550 (L510 in TRPV2) and E570 (Q530 in TRPV2) as potentially important determinants of RTx binding to TRPV1, consistent with previous experimental demonstrations that mutations of these residues weaken activation of TRPV1 by vanilloids (<a href=\"#bib11\">Elokely et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gavva et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jordt and Julius, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). To quantify the contribution of each of these residues to TRPV1 channel activation by RTx under our experimental conditions, we mutated each to the corresponding residue in TRPV2. We then expressed each construct in oocytes and used the two electrode voltage-clamp technique to study activation by RTx and by the non-specific TRPV channel activator 2-APB. We recorded time courses for channel activation by each agonist while stepping the membrane potential from \u221260 to +60 mV every 3 s from a holding potential of 0 mV using an external recording solution containing 100\u2009mM KCl (internal K<sup>+</sup> concentration in a healthy oocyte is 100\u2009mM) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, left). We also recorded current-voltage (I-V) relations by stepping over a wider range of voltages in the absence and presence of activators, or in the presence of ruthenium red (RR), a non-specific inhibitor of TRP channels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, right). Because RTx has high affinity for TRPV1 and its interaction with perfusion tubing makes it difficult to reliably control its concentration in the low nM range, we applied the vanilloid at 100 nM, a concentration that is saturating based on our RTx binding assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In the case of the wild-type TRPV1 channel, 2-APB produced reversible activation of outward and inward currents, RTx produced effectively irreversible activation on the time-scale of our recordings, and RR blocked the RTx-activated currents (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, left). The I-V relations we recorded gave results that were consistent with the time courses, and we used these to present results from a population of cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, right). Similar results were obtained with each of the four TRPV1 mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013E</a>), with the exception being the S512F mutant, where we could readily see dissociation of RTx after removing the vanilloid from the recording chamber (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), suggesting that this mutant weakens the affinity of RTx. Although previous studies suggest that some of these residues are determinants of vanilloid-sensitivity in TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gavva et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jordt and Julius, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yang et al., 2015</a>), their individual substitution by the equivalent residues in TRPV2 is not sufficient to produce large disruptions in the activation by a saturating concentration of RTx."

Although we did not measure the binding affinity of RTx for the TRPV1 QM, leaving open the possibility that the vanilloid binds without activating the channel, this is unlikely because individually the T550I and M547L mutants dramatically weaken RTx binding affinity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gavva et al., 2004</a>). To further define which residues are most critical, we made double mutants where we combined S512F, the mutation that speeds RTx dissociation, with each of the other three mutations. Both S512F/M547L and S512F/T550L channels lost sensitivity to RTx, whereas the S512F/E570Q mutant retained RTx sensitivity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>), indicating that S512, M547 and T550 are more important determinants of TRPV1 activation by RTx than E570. We also examined all four possible triple mutants, and only the mutant that left S512 intact retained sensitivity to RTx (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Collectively, these results suggest that 1) S512 is the most critical determinant of RTx sensitivity, 2) M547 and T550 are also important, and 3) E570 may or may not contribute to the differential sensitivity of TRPV1 and TRPV2 to RTx."

                                "text": "We began investigating the properties of TRPV2 by testing whether the channel is sensitive to RTx. Although TRPV2 could be activated by 2-APB, the channel was completely insensitive to RTx (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), consistent with previous reports that this TRP channel is insensitive to capsaicin (<a href=\"#bib8\">Caterina et al., 1999</a>). We then introduced all four TRPV1 residues that contribute to RTx sensitivity into TRPV2 to make the TRPV2 QM, and observed that the channel remained insensitive to capsaicin, but was robustly activated by the higher affinity vanilloid RTx (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). RTx produced much stronger activation when compared to 2-APB, and we observed little evidence for dissociation of the vanilloid after its removal from the recording chamber (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), suggestive of strong and stable binding to TRPV2 QM. To examine the strength of RTx binding to the TRPV2 channel, we undertook binding assays after expressing 1D4-tagged TRPV2 and TRPV2 QM in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and isolating yeast membranes, similar to the experiments described above with TRPV1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Although we only observed weak binding of RTx to TRPV2, the TRPV2 QM displayed robust and high-affinity RTx binding with a K<sub>d</sub> of 18 nM (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The affinity of RTx for the TRPV2 QM is about 30-fold lower compared to TRPV1, suggesting that other differences between TRPV1 and TRPV2 may influence RTx affinity. Indeed, there are eight other residues located near the RTx binding pocket that differ between TRPV1 and TRPV2 (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which may also explain why the TRPV2 QM is not activated by capsaicin. To examine the relative importance of the four residues for mediating RTx sensitivity in the TRPV2 QM, we constructed triple mutants and evaluated their sensitivity to RTx electrophysiologically. All three triple mutants containing the F472S mutation (equivalent to S512 in TRPV1) were sensitive to RTx, whereas the one triple mutant that retained F472 was insensitive to RTx (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), consistent with a dominant role of S512 that we observed in TRPV1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also investigated the RTx sensitivity of three double mutants containing the F472S mutation, and observed that either L507M or L510T rendered the TRPV2 channel sensitive to RTx (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), again matching our results for loss of function experiments in TRPV1 and demonstrating that only two point mutations are required to make the TRPV2 channel sensitive to RTx. Notably, the F472S single mutation is likely not sufficient to confer RTx sensitivity to TRPV2, as the F472S/Q530E was unresponsive to the vanilloid (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

                                "text": "Previous studies on TRPV1 have shown that vanilloids such as capsaicin promote the open state with high efficacy, with maximal open probabilities (P<sub>o</sub>) of around 0.8 to 0.9 at saturating concentrations of the agonist (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hui et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Oseguera et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Premkumar et al., 2002</a>). To explore the extent to which RTx promotes the open state of the TRPV2 QM, we investigated the unitary properties of the channel using inside-out patch recordings obtained from transiently transfected HEK293 cells. In a patch containing a single TRPV2-QM channel, we observed no spontaneous channel activity prior to application of any agonist (data not shown), but a few seconds of exposure to a solution containing 100 nM RTx resulted in robust channel activation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The channel entered a mode where the P<sub>o</sub> was very close to 1 for the entirety of the recording (approximately 8 min), presenting only brief closures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and E</a>). The conductance of the main conducting state was 101 pS in symmetrical 140\u2009mM NaCl at +90 mV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A, D and G</a>), but occasional subconducting states could also be detected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We observed pronounced rectification to the single channel conductance, with a value of 28 pS at -90 mV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B, D and G</a>). These results reveal that the single channel conductance of TRPV2 QM is quite high and that it rectifies, two properties that are similar to what has been observed for TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hui et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Oseguera et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Premkumar et al., 2002</a>). Two other patches containing two TRPV2 QM channels each presented a slightly lower P<sub>o</sub> at 100 nM RTx (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), as the channels in these patches appeared to enter long-lived resting states between bursts of maximal P<sub>o</sub>(<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). When a higher concentration of RTx was used (400 nM), long-lived closed states could be detected in two patches with a single channel and two patches with two channels each (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>). From these results we conclude that the permeation properties of TRPV2 channels are similar to TRPV1 channels and that RTx promotes the open state with high efficacy."

Our biochemical results with expressed TRPV1 constructs and the RTx binding assay demonstrate that the full-length protein expressed in yeast is competent to bind RTx with high affinity, but that the S1-S4 and S1-S6 domains are not sufficient to observe convincing binding of the vanilloid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). The RTx binding site identified in the cryo-EM structure of TRPV1 is located at the interface between the S1-S4 domain of one subunit and the S5-S6 domain of the adjacent subunit (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>), and therefore one explanation would be that our truncated constructs do not bind RTx because they are possibly monomeric. We took advantage of the ability of the full-length construct to bind RTx to investigate whether we could observe allosteric coupling between the binding of the vanilloid and that of DkTx, a tarantula toxin that binds to the outer pore of TRPV1. We observed readily detectable shifts in the K<sub>d</sub> for RTx binding in the presence of DkTx (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), indicating that both toxins are able to bind to our preparation of TRPV1 and that they are allosterically coupled. Although this type of allosteric coupling is embodied in the allosteric models that have been widely used to understand the complex polymodal gating of TRPV1 seen in electrophysiological studies (<a href=\"#bib57\">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Latorre et al., 2007</a>), this is the first direct biochemical demonstration of allosteric coupling between two ligands that activate TRPV1."

Our results demonstrate that as few as two TRPV1 residues need to be introduced into TRPV2 in order for RTx to bind to the channel with high affinity and to fully activate the channel (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This finding suggests that a quiescent RTx binding pocket already exists in TRPV2, requiring only subtle engineering to make it competent to bind RTx, and demonstrating that the same basic vanilloid-activation mechanism exists in TRPV2 channels. Our single channel recordings of TRPV2 show that RTx binding can achieve high P<sub>o</sub>, and that the conductance of the open state is high and exhibits rectification (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), properties that are very similar to the TRPV1 channel (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hui et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Oseguera et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Premkumar et al., 2002</a>). Collectively, these findings fit very well with the recent TRPV2 cryo-EM structure (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zubcevic et al., 2016</a>), which shows that the channel adopts a structure that is remarkably similar to TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liao et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Our results are also compatible with a computational model of RTx docked into the structure of TRPV1, where the methoxyl and hydroxyl bearing aromatic ring of RTx hydrogen bond with S512 in TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Elokely et al., 2016</a>). If we superimpose the cryo-EM structures of TRPV1 and TRPV2, the native F472 in TRPV2 (corresponding to S512) would likely sterically clash with the methoxyl and hydroxyl groups of RTx, and could not support the stabilizing hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl side chain of S512 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), explaining why this position is so critical for vanilloid binding to both TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels."

In addition, the residues mutated in the TRPV2 quadruple mutant are for the most part conserved among TRPV2, TRPV3, and TRPV4 channels (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that despite differing functional properties and physiological roles, it is possible that the vanilloid gating pathway of TRPV1 and TRPV2 is also conserved in TRPV3 and TRPV4 channels."

No spontaneous channel activity was recorded in control solution (data not shown). Recordings in RTx were started as soon as the patch was perfused with the agonist, which was followed by a 10\u201330\u2009s delay period in which no channel activity was observed, followed by robust channel activation. To reflect the P<sub>o</sub> of RTx-bound channels, mean P<sub>o</sub> values shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a> were calculated after the initial period where no channel activity was observed. The P<sub>o</sub> for every sweep was calculated using the 50% threshold crossing technique, which consists in generating idealized traces from the recordings, where data points above a specified threshold are assigned a value of 1 and data points below the threshold are assigned a value of 0, and the P<sub>o</sub> is calculated as the mean value of the idealized trace. For recordings at +90 mV, a threshold value of 4.5\u2009pA was used (approximately half of the maximal conductance level of 10\u2009pA), whereas a threshold of 1.2\u2009pA was used for the recordings at -90 mV. A 5-pass binomial smoothing function was applied to the data at -90 mV prior to calculation of the P<sub>o</sub>. For multi-channel patches, multiple thresholds were used and idealized traces were assigned a value of 2 when two channels were open simultaneously. For data obtained at +90 mV a threshold slightly lower than 50% of the maximal single-channel current amplitude was used so that subconductance levels were counted as channel openings. The mean P<sub>o</sub> data in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a> is the average of the P<sub>o</sub>-values for all sweeps in each patch, with an N = 2 for two-channel patches. For each patch the mean P<sub>o</sub>was also calculated from the normalized all-points histograms. In this case, histograms compiled from all recorded data-points after leak subtraction at a specified voltage were normalized to the area under the histogram curve. A Gaussian curve was fit to the data centered at 0\u2009pA, and the area under its curve (A<sub>C</sub>) was calculated. The P<sub>o</sub> was then calculated as P<sub>o</sub> = 1 \u2013 A<sub>C</sub>. Both methods for calculating P<sub>o</sub> gave identical results (data not shown). The single-channel current amplitudes were calculated from Gaussian fits to the all-points histogram portion corresponding to the current level of a single open channel."

Unlike TRPV1 channels, vanilloid compounds do not activate TRPV2 channels, although both channels have a similar architecture. Here, the authors have used biochemical and electrophysiological approaches to identify the minimal determinants of resiniferatoxin (RTx) binding site in TRPV1 channels. Strikingly, they were able to transfer this binding site from TRPV1 to TRPV2 channels with as few as four binding site mutations, which also permitted investigation of the gating properties of TRPV2. This demonstrates that TRPV1 and TRPV2 not only share very similar structures, as demonstrated by recent cryoEM structures, but also very similar channel gating mechanics, and that a \"quiescent\" RTx binding pocket is present in TRPV2. This is a foundational study, which demonstrates that gating mechanism is conserved between these channels and the ligand sensing can be ported between various channels of this family."

The manuscript is very clearly written and the interpretations generally warranted. The results are of high importance to the field of ion channels, but also to those interested in pain sensing and sensory perception in general\" and \"I was impressed by the use of extensive biochemistry to demonstrate binding rather than limiting the study to dose response curves which is a standard in the field. Their binding measurements provide crucial evidence that the activation of the channels involve direct binding of RTx to TRPV1 and mutant TRPV2 channels. From a mechanistic standpoint, this is much more insightful because a dose-response curve would have just demonstrated that the activity is portable. Dose-response curves do not discriminate between the possibility that the RTx is also binding to TRPV2 but fails to activate the channel due to a lack of \"proper\" gating machinery or that the RTx just does not bind to the TRPV2 channel. In this study, they have addressed these questions comprehensively.\" The essential points to be addressed are the following:"

The authors seem to confuse the TRPA1 structure with that of TRPV1? A coiled coil was observed in the C-terminal region of the TRPA1 structure, not TRPV1. Also the TRPV1 structure suggests that any construct containing S5-S6 would likely need to tetramerize to form a native structure. Furthermore, SEC is a rather poor method, without additional information from other experiments, to assess oligomeric state. This comes up again in the Discussion, where the authors discuss SEC data that are not presented in the paper (only data for S1-S4 is shown, and S1-S6 and S1-Cterm constructs are discussed). It would be preferable to either include the data under Discussion and/or to tone down the arguments about oligomeric state, which are not particularly essential to the conclusions. If the authors want to include the current discussion of likely oligomeric state, then they should also include additional information about their FSEC experiments, such as the behavior of molecular weight standards on their column, and/or of related or previously validated constructs."

Therefore, it is still possible that RTx is binding to TRPV1QM mutant but is unable to activate the channels."

The manuscript is very clearly written and the interpretations generally warranted. The results are of high importance to the field of ion channels, but also to those interested in pain sensing and sensory perception in general\" and \"I was impressed by the use of extensive biochemistry to demonstrate binding rather than limiting the study to dose response curves which is a standard in the field. Their binding measurements provide crucial evidence that the activation of the channels involve direct binding of RTx to TRPV1 and mutant TRPV2 channels. From a mechanistic standpoint, this is much more insightful because a dose-response curve would have just demonstrated that the activity is portable. Dose-response curves do not discriminate between the possibility that the RTx is also binding to TRPV2 but fails to activate the channel due to a lack of \"proper\" gating machinery or that the RTx just does not bind to the TRPV2 channel. In this study, they have addressed these questions comprehensively.\" The essential points to be addressed are the following:</i>"

The authors seem to confuse the TRPA1 structure with that of TRPV1? A coiled coil was observed in the C-terminal region of the TRPA1 structure, not TRPV1. Also the TRPV1 structure suggests that any construct containing S5-S6 would likely need to tetramerize to form a native structure. Furthermore, SEC is a rather poor method, without additional information from other experiments, to assess oligomeric state. This comes up again in the Discussion, where the authors discuss SEC data that are not presented in the paper (only data for S1-S4 is shown, and S1-S6 and S1-Cterm constructs are discussed). It would be preferable to either include the data under Discussion and/or to tone down the arguments about oligomeric state, which are not particularly essential to the conclusions. If the authors want to include the current discussion of likely oligomeric state, then they should also include additional information about their FSEC experiments, such as the behavior of molecular weight standards on their column, and/or of related or previously validated constructs.</i>"
