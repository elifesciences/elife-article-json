The RPA that accumulated at sites of AID-mediated DNA damage was subsequently shown to be associated with the RAD51 recombination protein (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yamane et al., 2013</a>), suggesting the formation of homologous recombination intermediates.

DT40 modifies its rearranged <i>Ig</i> light chain gene primarily by uni-directional gene conversion using nearby <i>pseudo-V</i> genes as conversion donor sequences (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buerstedde et al., 1990</a>). However, GC decreases and SH increases if homologous recombination is impaired by inactivation of RAD51 paralogues (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sale et al., 2001</a>), upon deletion of the upstream <i>pseudo V</i> genes that act as GC donor sequences (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arakawa et al., 2004</a>) or following inactivation of the <i>UNG</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib36\">Saribasak et al., 2006</a>). SH of the <i>Ig light chain</i> gene, as well as a green fluorescence protein (GFP) transgene were found to be strongly increased in the presence of a nearby Diversification Activator (DIVAC) sequence (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blagodatski et al., 2009</a>). It was recently shown that this DIVAC consists of the chicken enhancer and enhancer-like elements and that it can be replaced by the <i>human Ig lambda</i> (<i>hIg\u03bbE)</i> and <i>Ig heavy intron</i> (<i>IgHiE</i>) enhancers (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buerstedde et al., 2014</a>).

This model system responds to the appropriate stimulation by increasing both Ig switch region transcription and AID expression (<a href=\"#bib23\">Muramatsu et al., 2000</a>) and by recombining its endogenous Ig heavy chain locus or transfected switch region constructs by CSR."

Using both DT40 and CH12 cells, we demonstrate here that AID can induce homologous recombination of repeats (RR) leading to frequent deletions between direct repeats."

The <i>RFP</i> genes were efficiently translated due to the presence of two in-frame ATG start codons, one at the beginning of the 5\u2032 untranslated exon and one at the beginning of the <i>RFP</i> open reading frame (marked by arrows in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These constructs as well as all others used in our study were integrated in a targeted manner into the IgL(\u2212) DT40 cell line at the position of the deleted <i>IgL</i> locus (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blagodatski et al., 2009</a>). FACS analysis of subclones of the transfectants revealed a trailing cloud of cells with decreased red fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Red fluorescence loss was stimulated 10- to 30-fold in the presence of the human <i>Ig lambda</i> enhancer (<i>hIg\u03bbE</i>) DIVAC (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buerstedde et al., 2014</a>) (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B2</a> to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B3</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B4</a> to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B5</a>; and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These results, combined with our previous extensive analyses of <i>GFP</i>-based reporter constructs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blagodatski et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buerstedde et al., 2014</a>), suggested that the loss of red fluorescence was due to inactivation of the <i>RFP</i> transgenes by AID dependent, DIVAC-stimulated hypermutation events. Interestingly, a discrete cell population of intermediate red fluorescence was seen in transfectants of the <i>tdT</i> but not the <i>DsR</i> gene constructs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B3</a>, circled). Since tdT is encoded by a direct tandem repeat of a <i>RFP</i> gene sequence (<a href=\"#bib38\">Shaner et al., 2004</a>), the intermediate red fluorescence possibly reflected the loss of one of the <i>tdT</i> repeats by intragenic recombination."

Transfectants of CH12 varied in their FACS profiles most likely due to integration of the transfected construct at variable chromosomal positions. However, about one in three transfectants generated a low number of cells similar to R1 and R2 cells of the DT40 transfectants. The frequency at which R1 and R2 cells were generated was strongly increased when factors known to increase both AID expression and <i>Ig</i> CSR (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kinoshita et al., 1998</a>) were added to the culture of CH12 transfectants (compare <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B2</a> to <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B3</a> and data not shown). Whereas the DT40 transfectant showed about 50 times fewer R1 than R2 cells, the frequency of cells in the two gates was roughly equal in CH12 transfectants indicating increased CSR in CH12 as compared to DT40 cells. CH12 transfectants also generated strong subpopulations of R3 cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B3</a>), but almost all of these cells disappeared when blasticidin was added to the cultures (data not shown) suggesting that these cells arose through transcriptional silencing of the <i>tdT</i> gene and not inactivation by hypermutation."

RR mediated deletions could be visualized after chromosomal integration of fluorescent reporter constructs by virtue of changes in the fluorescence profiles of individual cells within expanding cultures. Deletions occurred at high frequencies in different sequence contexts and in both the chicken DT40 and the murine CH12 cell lines. Interestingly, transfectants of DT40 recombined the duplicated <i>RSV</i> promoters and <i>tdT</i> repeats as frequently by RR as they inactivated the RFP genes by somatic hypermutation (SH). Although DT40 diversifies its <i>Ig</i> genes by gene conversion (GC), an artificial homeologous sequence upstream of the <i>tdT</i> and <i>GFP</i> genes was recombined more often by RR than it was modified by GC. Similarly, class switch recombination (CSR) active CH12 cells rearranged a construct containing duplicated <i>RSV</i> promoters and intronic switch regions as often by RR as by CSR. AID-induced RR does not seem to involve error prone DNA synthesis because precise deletions, but no non-templated nucleotide changes, were encountered in a large number of recombinant sequences. Our data indicate that AID-mediated RR can be a remarkably efficient process."

This could either be a single strand gap generated by nuclease mediated resection of the nicked strand (Model 1, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C\u2013F</a>) or a double strand break believed to occur when the replication fork collapses at the site of the unrepaired single strand nick within one of the template strands (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kowalczykowski, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Petermann and Helleday, 2010</a>) (Model 2, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G\u2013K</a>). Since recombination occurred at high frequency between the <i>RSV</i> repeats, which are upstream of the transcription start site and hence likely to be hundreds of bases away from the peak of AID-induced cytidine deamination (<a href=\"#bib36\">Saribasak et al., 2006</a>), both models invoke substantial DNA resection to expose single stranded DNA distant from the nicks (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C,I</a>).

Later stages of the models postulate heteroduxplex DNA and Holliday junctions (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E,I</a>), which are consistent with the sequence analysis of homeologous repeat recombinants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Nevertheless, the choice, validity, and details of the two alternative models remain speculative. Further insight into the RR reaction will likely be provided by the analysis of constructs containing inverted repeats and the behavior of constructs in cells with specific recombination and repair factor deficiencies (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Willis et al., 2014</a>)."

Similar to RR, GC, which diversifies the rearranged Ig genes of B cells in chickens and many mammalian species (<a href=\"#bib31\">Reynaud et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Butler 1998</a>), requires the interaction of nearby homeologous sequences on the same chromosome (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arakawa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sale, 2004</a>).

How GC and RR are controlled during Ig repertoire development remains unresolved. Both of the fluorescent reporter genes in our constructs were transcribed and expected to accumulate AID induced nicks which might facilitate RR.

Despite likely suboptimal excitation of tdT by the 488 nm laser, the red fluorescence of tdT expressing cells was very bright, causing difficulty in displaying positive and negative cells on the same screen. FACS settings were optimized for the analysis of either tdT or DsR expressing cells and then consistently used for the analysis of respective primary transfectants and subclones. Primary transfectants were analyzed 20 days after transfection (about 12 days in blasticidin free culture medium), subclones were analyzed 12 days after subcloning. Over 20 subclones of each transfectant were usually analyzed. Preparative FACS sorts were performed on Beckman Coulter MoFlo using the following parameters: 488 nm excitation, 100 mW power laser for GFP; 532 nm, 200 mW laser for RFP expression."

The current manuscript uncovers another and unexpected function of AID as well as for DIVAC. The work here shows that they collaboratively promote reciprocal recombination between two homologous sequences. Remarkably, they are very frequently subjected to reciprocal recombination, even though the two homologous sequences are relatively short, only up to 1kb, and localized at a distance of several-kb. The finding significantly contributes to the understanding of AID-mediated mutagenesis involving repeat sequences. The authors carefully designed experiments, did an impressive amount of work, and confirmed reproducibility of data using various recombinant plasmids. We therefore recommend publication in a high profile journal such as <i>eLife</i>, if appropriate revision is done, particularly on the model figure."

The authors propose that single-strand breaks (step 4) triggers end-resection (step 5) and subsequent strand invasion into homologous sequences (step 6). Given the extremely quick repair of single-strand breaks in mammalian cells, it seems unclear that a single-strand breaks could be efficiently resected and stimulate reciprocal recombination. Another possibility is that abasic sites (step 3) stall DNA replication: replication stalling may be released by template switching to adjacent homologous sequences. The manuscript should be published soon if the authors discuss other possibilities for initiation of reciprocal recombination by replication blockage at AID-induced DNA damage sites. A balanced model might consider the one proposed and others. In any case, if the authors want to stick with only their own speculative ideas they must address the following."

In <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>(5), what enzyme would resect a nick and, if the nick is resected, what is left over to carry out the homology search? That is only one strand would make a D-loop upon invasion and this would be an unusual structure to resolve. It may be that a helicase would be a more likely player. Also, for a large single-strand gap initiated by a SSB, the complementary strand is still intact, so what would prevent DNA ligase from filling in the single-strand gap instead of the cell initiating a homology search? In <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>(7), most models I have seen for double Holliday require second-strand invasion, which cannot occur if you only have a SSB. The events observed seem like they may still be accounted for by conversion of a SSB to a DSB, perhaps during replication over the nick leading to fork collapse. If this occurred, repair may be favored by HR due to the cell being in S-phase and may preferentially repair with nearby sequences due to the large number of AID-initiated nicks, since nicks have been shown to stimulate repair of DSBs."

The authors propose that single-strand breaks (step 4) triggers end-resection (step 5) and subsequent strand invasion into homologous sequences (step 6). Given the extremely quick repair of single-strand breaks in mammalian cells, it seems unclear that a single-strand breaks could be efficiently resected and stimulate reciprocal recombination. Another possibility is that abasic sites (step 3) stall DNA replication: replication stalling may be released by template switching to adjacent homologous sequences. The manuscript should be published soon if the authors discuss other possibilities for initiation of reciprocal recombination by replication blockage at AID-induced DNA damage sites. A balanced model might consider the one proposed and others. In any case if the authors want to stick with only their own speculative ideas they must address the following</i>."

In</i> <a href=\"#fig10\"><i>Figure 10</i></a><i>(5), what enzyme would resect a nick and, if the nick is resected, what is left over to carry out the homology search? That is only one strand would make a D-loop upon invasion and this would be an unusual structure to resolve. It may be that a helicase would be a more likely player. Also, for a large single-strand gap initiated by a SSB, the complementary strand is still intact, so what would prevent DNA ligase from filling in the single-strand gap instead of the cell initiating a homology search? In</i> <a href=\"#fig10\"><i>Figure 10</i></a><i>(7), most models I have seen for double Holliday require second-strand invasion, which cannot occur if you only have a SSB. The events observed seem like they may still be accounted for by conversion of a SSB to a DSB, perhaps during replication over the nick leading to fork collapse. If this occurred, repair may be favored by HR due to the cell being in S-phase and may preferentially repair with nearby sequences due to the large number of AID-initiated nicks, since nicks have been shown to stimulate repair of DSBs</i>."

Based on the comments of the reviewers and editors, we have substantially revised the manuscript and the figures. The one major criticism of the manuscript related to our model (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>) for how AID induces deletion between repeats by homologous recombination. The comments were insightful and prompted us to revise the single strand nick/gap version of the model (so that now, initial strand invasion is mediated by the intact DNA strand) and to add an alternative, replication-induced double strand break version of the model. We have also rewritten the paragraph of the Discussion dealing with the models. We believe that it will be valuable to present both models given the uncertainty of how these AID-induced events occur: as noted in the review \u201cthere is some evidence that HR may be initiated by an SSB as well as by double-strand breaks (DSBs)\u201d."

However, since the identity for the bands, thought to represent the different types recombinant sequences, was verified by subcloning and sequencing, we feel that Southern blot analyses would add little and unduly delay publication of the manuscript. We also note that a preponderance of smaller PCR products indicative of deletion (such as those with pairs 1/4 and 1/5) could be due largely or entirely to preferential amplification of smaller PCR products at the expense of the full-length products. We believe that the combination of PCR, sequencing, and FACS data provides a clear picture of the frequency of the various events, and that a more detailed analysis taking advantage of blasticidin resistance would not substantially add to this."
