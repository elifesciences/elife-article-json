                    "text": "During sleep, the thalamus generates a characteristic pattern of transient, 11-15 Hz sleep spindle oscillations, which synchronize the cortex through large-scale thalamocortical loops. Spindles have been increasingly demonstrated to be critical for sleep-dependent consolidation of memory, but the specific neural mechanism for this process remains unclear. We show here that cortical spindles are spatiotemporally organized into circular wave-like patterns, organizing neuronal activity over tens of milliseconds, within the timescale for storing memories in large-scale networks across the cortex via spike-time dependent plasticity. These circular patterns repeat over hours of sleep with millisecond temporal precision, allowing reinforcement of the activity patterns through hundreds of reverberations. These results provide a novel mechanistic account for how global sleep oscillations and synaptic plasticity could strengthen networks distributed across the cortex to store coherent and integrated memories."

Spindles have been increasingly demonstrated to be critical for sleep-dependent consolidation of memory, but the specific neural mechanism for this process remains unclear. We show here that cortical spindles are spatiotemporally organized into circular wave-like patterns, organizing neuronal activity over tens of milliseconds, within the timescale for storing memories in large-scale networks across the cortex via spike-time dependent plasticity. These circular patterns repeat over hours of sleep with millisecond temporal precision, allowing reinforcement of the activity patterns through hundreds of reverberations. These results provide a novel mechanistic account for how global sleep oscillations and synaptic plasticity could strengthen networks distributed across the cortex to store coherent and integrated memories."

First, a computer algorithm analyzed electrical recordings of brain activity taken while five patients with epilepsy slept. The patients were being monitored to help with their seizures, and the recordings showed that spindles do not occur at the same time throughout the cortex as previously thought. Instead, the spindle is a wave that begins in portion of the cortex near the ear, spirals through the cortex toward the top of back of the head and then on to the forehead area before circling back."

Next, Muller et al. plan to develop computer models of the spindles and verify whether their models make accurate predictions by studying spindles in sleeping mice and rats."

In the two-stage model of memory consolidation (<a href=\"#bib34\">McClelland et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rasch and Born, 2007</a>), memories are integrated in the hippocampus and then linked in the neocortex for long-term storage, where information represented in visual, auditory, somatosensory, or cognitive regions must be bound into a coherent whole (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wheeler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Horner et al., 2015</a>). It is well established that sleep oscillations actively contribute to this process: during stage 2 sleep spindles, the thalamus generates a rhythmic activity pattern that becomes widespread through large-scale thalamocortical loops (<a href=\"#bib7\">Contreras et al., 1996</a>), and spindles are critical to sleep-dependent memory consolidation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gais et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mednick et al., 2013</a>). Long-range connections in cortex result primarily from excitatory pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sholl, 1956</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sch\u00fcz et al., 2002</a>), but precisely how sleep oscillations aid strengthening of these excitatory connections between distributed cortical networks through spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) remains unclear, particularly in the presence of long axonal conduction delays (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lubenov and Siapas, 2008</a>). Here, we identify a global activity pattern repeatedly observed during sleep spindle oscillations in human neocortex that could serve this role."

ECoG arrays were implanted in subjects undergoing evaluation for resective surgery of epileptogenic cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, left). Over several days of recording, these subjects exhibit long periods without major epileptic events. During that time, subjects express a relatively normal sleep architecture, with well-defined sleep oscillations. Stage 2 sleep epochs were then manually identified by an expert rater, and sleep spindles recorded on the ECoG were isolated using automated techniques (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hagler et al., 2016</a>). These spindles appeared physiologically normal and well-isolated from background noise (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our algorithmic approach classifies spatiotemporal patterns as expanding waves, defined as a significant linear increase in phase offset with distance from a point source (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods \u2013 Spatiotemporal dynamics), or rotating waves, defined as a significant increase in phase offset with rotation about a wave center (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In 41,860 spindle oscillation cycles tested across subjects, a large proportion (50.8%) was classified as rotating waves, along with a smaller subset (15.6%) as expanding. After inspecting these results, we observed further that the rotating waves exhibited a clear bias towards travel in the temporal <math id=\"inf1\"><mo>\u2192</mo></math> parietal <math id=\"inf2\"><mo>\u2192</mo></math> frontal (TPF) direction (69.5%, p&lt;10<sup>\u221210</sup>, one-tail binomial test against equal occurrence, 14,796 TPF cycles, 21,272 total; for each individual subject p&lt;10<sup>\u22123</sup>, see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a> for individual wave totals) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Propagation speed distributions peaked between 2\u20135\u2009m/s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), varying within a narrow range from the 20th to the 80th percentiles (3\u20139\u2009m/s for the full distribution; 4\u201310, 3\u20138, 3\u201310, 2\u20133, and 4\u201313\u2009m/s for individual subjects, respectively), within the range of conduction speeds for the short (<a href=\"#bib20\">Girard et al., 2001</a>) and long (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sch\u00fcz et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Swadlow and Waxman, 2012</a>) white matter association fibers. Further, this rotating TPF organization occurred consistently across subjects and implantation hemispheres (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 5</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s7\">7</a>)."

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of similarity indices among identified rotational waves is highly shifted to the right (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, black) compared to the CDF for all cycles (5 subjects, 42/54 sleep epochs, 77.8% significant, one-tailed two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, <math id=\"inf14\"><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.01</mn></mrow></math>, Bonferroni correction), indicating higher intra-class similarity between these cycles than for other wave types. Note that this is not simply a consequence of the rotational phase pattern itself, as expanding waves emanating from a consistent point source could certainly exhibit higher intra-class similarity than rotational waves with a varying center. Further, the median similarity index consistently increases in individual subjects when rotational waves of progressively increasing strength are considered (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This indicates the observed rotating waves strongly modulate temporal precision in repeated patterns of population activity. To be specific, by utilizing the average temporal frequency for these spindle oscillations (13.5\u2009Hz), we can estimate that in two cycles whose similarity index falls into the highest bin in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> (0.9\u20131.0), 50% of electrodes will experience an alignment of the spatiotemporal activity pattern within a 5 millisecond temporal window. Recent experiments have shown a tight temporal link between field potentials and synaptic currents (both EPSPs and IPSPs; <a href=\"#bib22\">Haider et al., 2016</a>). By detecting these precisely recurring activity patterns in ECoG recordings, we can infer that distributed networks composed of local excitatory and inhibitory groups, whose firing is modulated by thalamocortical fibers during the sleep spindle, are repeatedly activated with a millisecond accuracy that is well within the temporal precision required for STDP."

Finally, by studying repeats of rotating waves over 2.5\u2009hr of continuous sleep recording in Subject 1, we observe a preliminary indication of increased reverberation consistent with strengthening of distributed excitatory networks: similarity in the next identified rotating wave is highly predictive of the number of strong reverberations throughout the night (black dots, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Randomizing the relationship between the next rotating wave and the rest of the sleep recording eliminates this effect (shuffling control, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), and such increased reverberation is not observed for expanding waves under similar conditions (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In recent years, several studies have reported a mixture of 'local' and 'global' spindles using amplitude-duration thresholding approaches (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nir et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Andrillon et al., 2011</a>). By carefully studying the\u00a0phase information in the spindle frequency band recorded on large-scale ECoG arrays, we have uncovered that a substantial number of spindle oscillation cycles are organized into global, hemisphere-spanning patterns of rotating and expanding waves (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). These patterns most likely represent the characteristic spatiotemporal organization of the 'global' spindles observed in Andrillon et al. (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andrillon et al., 2011</a>) (\u226540% involvement, cf. their Figure 5C), with more localized patterns left unclassified by our detection approach (<a href=\"#fig1s9\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 9</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s12\">12</a>). These global patterns are likely established through widespread thalamocortical loops, placing the cortex into a state of large-scale coherence (<a href=\"#bib7\">Contreras et al., 1996</a>), shaped into rotating and expanding waves through corticocortical white matter connections with axonal conduction speeds consistent with the observed propagation speeds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Future computational modeling work will address in detail the role of thalamocortical, corticocortical, and corticothalamic connections in generating the spatiotemporal activity patterns reported here."

While some memories integrate content from single sensory modalities, requiring consolidation in only single cortical regions (such as motor cortex, <a href=\"#bib27\">Khazipov et al., 2004</a>), many memories integrate multimodal sensory and cognitive information (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gibson and Maunsell, 1997</a>), and require 'global' integration of distributed networks across the cortex. In this work, we have identified a novel mechanism by which this process could occur: the stereotyped activity patterns reported here may enable STDP to establish large-scale neuronal assemblies at scales where axonal conduction delays are long relative to the oscillation cycle (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fries, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lubenov and Siapas, 2008</a>), and repeat many times throughout sleep with millisecond accuracy. While the schema illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> is a highly simplified view of the microscale interactions between long-range excitatory projections and local networks during spindle oscillations, computational and theoretical studies have previously obtained a detailed understanding of STDP dynamics with neurons receiving sequenced (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rao and Sejnowski, 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2003</a>), bursting (<a href=\"#bib50\">Song et al., 2000</a>), and oscillating inputs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Muller et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Luz and Shamir, 2016</a>). This theoretical understanding of the interplay between STDP and population activity can allow in future work a precise account of how microscale synaptic interactions are shaped by global oscillation patterns, and how variability in these patterns (e.g. variation in wave speed, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) will affect this mechanism. Taken together, these results provide insight into how distributed information stored across cortical regions may be bound into a coherent, integrated, but specific memory through spike-time dependent synaptic plasticity."

Within the grid, electrodes were spaced 10\u2009mm apart. In some patients, linear ECoG arrays provided additional spatial coverage; application of our multichannel detection approach, however, focused on the two-dimensional electrode grid. One strip of electrodes positioned over the pial surface and facing the skull served as the reference during the recordings; results were additionally verified using an average reference. Note that due to reference artifacts, an average reference was employed for the recordings in Subject 4. We note as well that the temporal extent of the waves, over tens of milliseconds, makes electrophysiological artifacts such as volume conduction an unlikely explanation for the observations reported here.

In this approach, the SNR metric is calculated on short (500 ms) sliding windows in each channel. When the SNR metric reaches 0 dB, the signal and noise power are at parity, corresponding to a sharp, narrowband epoch in the recording.

PSDs for individual channel and spindle epochs were concatenated into a large array and averaged in each case. A clear peak in the 11\u201315\u2009Hz frequency band for the spindle epochs can be seen, while no peak is observed in the matched non-spindle epochs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

If the divisive normalization over an epoch of stage 2 sleep reached 5 dB, then the spindles were taken to be well-isolated and possessing the spectral characteristics necessary for an accurate phase representation, and were then included in further analysis. Based on this calculation, 54 individual epochs of stage 2 sleep, varying from 30 s to 35 min in duration, were selected in five clinical subjects."

Each electrode evolved in time according to its mean instantaneous frequency during the spindle, but with a randomized initial phase angle. These surrogate data thus possessed the same frequency content on average as in the original data, but with their spatial organization of phase removed. In this control, both rotating and expanding wave patterns were highly decreased (3.5% and 0.8% of cycles, respectively, compared to 64% and 14% in the original data)."

The authors examine the spatio-temporal structures of spindles during sleep in human, and their possible role in memory consolidation. The techniques used are developed from their earlier work where waves were found in monkey visual cortex. Used here in considering both amplitude and phase information, the authors show that spindles exhibit a sophisticated spatio-temporal structure, with the majority of spindles traveling from temporal to parietal to frontal (TPF) cortex. The authors suggest that such traveling waves could serve to facilitate spike-timing dependent plasticity between anatomically remote areas, which would otherwise be difficult due to long axonal delays. The analysis is rigorous and the application of methods to detect propagating waves to spindles is novel. Spindles are of high interest for memory consolidation, and this dataset is highly valuable."

They rely on a large dataset of spindle oscillations and the provided movies give a good sense of the observations made. However, clarifications are needed. First, the authors should incorporate a definition of what they consider as rotating and expanding waves, as well as the specific criterion used to distinguish these. Definitions should appear in the main text, and the supplementary material should include the specific criteria used for the classification of spatio-temporal patterns of activity. In the absence of this, it remains quite difficult to validate the method."

This control demonstrates that frequency shifts cannot explain our results, indicating that the observed waves are due to a true phase shift across channels.
