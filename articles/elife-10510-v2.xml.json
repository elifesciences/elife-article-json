Here we show that USP14, a major deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates the UPS, is a substrate of Akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase critical in mediating intracellular signaling transducer for growth factors. We report that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of USP14 at Ser432, which normally blocks its catalytic site in the inactive conformation, activates its deubiquitinating activity in vitro and in cells. We also demonstrate that phosphorylation of USP14 is critical for Akt to regulate proteasome activity and consequently global protein degradation. Since Akt can be activated by a wide range of growth factors and is under negative control by phosphoinosotide phosphatase PTEN, we suggest that regulation of UPS by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of USP14 may provide a common mechanism for growth factors to control global proteostasis and for promoting tumorigenesis in PTEN-negative cancer cells."

Here we show that USP14, a major deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates the UPS, is a substrate of Akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase critical in mediating intracellular signaling transducer for growth factors. We report that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of USP14 at Ser432, which normally blocks its catalytic site in the inactive conformation, activates its deubiquitinating activity in vitro and in cells. We also demonstrate that phosphorylation of USP14 is critical for Akt to regulate proteasome activity and consequently global protein degradation. Since Akt can be activated by a wide range of growth factors and is under negative control by phosphoinosotide phosphatase PTEN, we suggest that regulation of UPS by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of USP14 may provide a common mechanism for growth factors to control global proteostasis and for promoting tumorigenesis in PTEN-negative cancer cells."

When proteins have fulfilled their purpose, or become damaged, they must be removed through a garbage disposal-like molecular machine in cells called the proteasome. A breakdown in the proteasome may lead to diseases in humans such as cancers and neurodegeneration. Cells have a system that can identify and mark proteins for destruction, and another system that counteracts this process and spares proteins from destruction. Precise regulation of these two systems helps ensure a healthy balance in cells."

Akt is an important signaling molecule that is activated in many tumor cells to promote the growth and multiplication of cells. Xu et al. discovered that by controlling USP14 activity, Akt can control the activity of the protein disposal machinery that in turn regulates the levels of many other proteins. These findings suggest that abnormal activity of USP14 in tumor cells with elevated Akt activity may contribute to cancer formation."

The 26S proteasome specifically targets and degrades proteins conjugated to ubiquitin. Regulation of protein deubiquitination by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) is recognized as an important regulatory step in the UPS. Ubiquitin-specific protease-14 (USP14), a DUB reversibly associated with the proteasome, negatively regulates the activity of proteasomes by trimming ubiquitin chains on proteasome-bound substrates (<a href=\"#bib3\">Borodovsky et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Koulich et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Lee et al., 2010</a>).

The activity of Akt is regulated by PI(3,4,5)P3, a lipid product of the phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). The intracellular levels of PI(3,4,5)P3 are negatively regulated by phosphatases such as SHIP1/2 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The latter, a phosphoinoside phosphatase, is encoded by a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in human cancers at high frequency (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cantley and Neel, 1999</a>). Akt has been reported to mediate the phosphorylation of many substrates that in turn regulate cell proliferation, metabolism, transcription, migration, and apoptosis. However, very little is known about its role in the UPS, and furthermore no mechanistic link between Akt and UPS has been elucidated."

Phosphorylation of S432 can be detected after incubation of WT, but not S432A mutant USP14, with recombinant activated Akt in a kinase reaction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This was further confirmed by using phos-tag electrophoresis which can specifically retard the migration of phosphorylated protein species (<a href=\"#bib10\">Kinoshita et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Expression of Myr-Akt also led to S432 phosphorylation of endogenous USP14 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Treatment with either MK2206 or AZD5363, two structurally unrelated Akt inhibitors, led to decrease of USP14 S432 phosphorylation levels (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Moreover, treatment with PI3K inhibitors, either Wortmannin or GDC0941, but not ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126, also significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels of USP14 S432 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). In addition, we tested growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) or epidermal growth factor (EGF), both of which are known to promote activation of Akt. We found that the treatment of IGF-1 or EGF resulted in phosphorylation of USP14 S432, which was blocked in cells pretreated with MK2206 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). Finally, USP14 S432 is dramatically more phosphorylated in PTEN knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which carry high levels of Akt activity, than that of WT MEFs as determined by western blotting using the phospho-USP14(S432) antibody and phos-tag electrophoresis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>), and the phosphorylation of USP14 S432 was blocked by Akt inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). From these results, we conclude that Ser432 of USP14 is a major phosphorylation site by Akt."

To this end, we generated a stable cell line expressing GFP-CL1 (also known as GFPu), an engineered ubiquitin-dependent proteasome substrate widely used as a reporter for UPS activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bence et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Kelly et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Liu et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Treatment of cells with Akt inhibitors or serum deprivation or PI3K inhibitor, all of which can block Akt activity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>), led to reduced level of GFP-CL1 as detected by both western blotting and fluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Conversely, the expression of activated Akt (Myr-Akt) led to increased levels of GFP-CL1 protein. Treatment of WT H4 cells with IGF-1 or EGF also led to increased levels of GFP-CL1 protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013G</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In contrast, in USP14 knockout H4 cells (generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>), the expression of Myr-Akt did not affect the levels of GFP-CL1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>).

We found that the levels of these proteins increased significantly in MG132-treated KO-AA cells compared to that of control KO-AA cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, Lane 5), suggesting that these proteins were indeed subject to an increased rate of proteasome degradation with expression of non-phosphorylatable USP14. Interestingly, the top hit on this list of 87 proteins that were differentially regulated upon the loss of USP14 is mTOR, a central established regulator of cellular metabolism and tumorigenesis. We confirmed the role of USP14 on the levels of mTOR by western blotting. We found that the levels of mTOR were reduced in H4 KO and H4 KO cells complemented with USP14 AA mutant, but restored upon the expression of USP14 DD mutant (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, our results suggest that phosphorylation of USP14 may provide a mechanism for Akt to regulate global protein degradation through the proteasome, which in turn may control key cellular pathways involved in regulating metabolism and tumorigenesis."

                        "text": "We report here a new mode of USP14 regulation involving its phosphorylation by the protein kinase Akt. The activity of USP14 is induced 800-fold by association with the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib13\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). Remarkably, Akt-dependent phosphorylation of USP14 elevates the catalytic activity of proteasome-associated USP14 beyond this level. Thus, Akt not only activates USP14 by a different mechanism than the proteasome, but it can cooperate with the proteasome to achieve more aggressive removal of ubiquitin from proteasome-docked substrates. Akt activation of USP14 has marked effects on protein turnover in cells, highlighting the physiological significance of the activity state of USP14. USP14 and its ortholog from yeast (Ubp6) can suppress degradation through both deubiquitination and a noncatalytic activity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bashore et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Hanna et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). The ability to rapidly adjust the rate of proteasomal degradation by responding to external signals, including growth factors, nutritional demands, and stress, is critical for maintaining cellular survival and preventing the toxicity associated with protein misfolding and accumulation of toxic aggregates. By regulating the rate of proteasomal degradation through phosphorylating USP14, Akt may exert controls over the entire proteome of short-lived proteins as well as cellular protein quality."

Furthermore, since Akt can be activated by a wide range of growth factors, such as insulin, EGF, IGF, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), through their respective receptors, regulation of USP14 by Akt-mediated phosphorylation may provide a general mechanism for growth factors to control global proteostasis during cell growth. Our results do not exclude the possibility that other kinases that are activatable by growth factors and activated in PTEN-deficient conditions can also mediate the phosphorylation of USP14."

Dys-regulation of UPS may disrupt cellular proteostasis and lead to the inappropriate accumulation of target proteins to compromise cellular and tissue homeostasis. Since UPS is critically involved in the degradation of cellular short-lived proteins which frequently serve in mediating intracellular signaling process, the regulation of UPS by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of USP14 may provide a mechanism to control multiple signaling process, raising the possibility that control of short-lived proteins might serve as an active process that has impact on cellular signaling, rather than as a degradative process per se. In this regard, regulation of UPS by Akt has been proposed to contribute to type II diabetes mediated by inflammation. Stimulation of adipocytes by TNF\u03b1 has been shown to lead to reduction of Akt (<a href=\"#bib18\">Medina et al., 2005</a>). Thus, a reduction of Akt might promote UPS to lead to global proteomic changes to contribute to the pathological consequence in diabetes."

The cell lysate of WT, <i>Usp14<sup>\u2013/\u2013</sup>, Usp14<sup>\u2013/\u2013</sup></i> reconstituted with WT USP14 (KO-WT), <i>Usp14<sup>\u2013/\u2013\u00a0</sup></i>reconstituted with AA mutant USP14 (KO-AA), <i>Usp14<sup>\u2013/\u2013\u00a0</sup></i>reconstituted with DD mutant USP14 (KO-DD), and KO-AA cells treated with 10 \u03bcM MG132 for 4\u2009hr were digested with trypsin and labeled with 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131-TMT labeling reagent (Thermo Scientific), respectively, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Equal amount of peptides with each TMT tag were mixed, and the resulting mixture of peptides was subjected to fractionation using off-line high pH reverse phase chromatography. Six fractions were collected and subsequently analyzed on Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. Three replicates were performed. Protein identification and quantification was done by Thermo Proteome discoverer (v1.4). The peptide false-positive rate was controlled to be less than 1%. The peak integration tolerance was set at 10 ppm. Only unique peptides were used for protein quantitation. An isobaric tag purity correction was performed. The labeling efficiency was measured and was greater than 99%. The quantitation normalization based on protein median was performed. The average ratios of each protein from three replicates were used for analysis."

They also report that USP14 undergoes phosphorylation at Ser432 in cells, that this is decreased by serum deprivation, increased in response to stimulation with IGF1 and suppressed by MK2206, which prevents the phosphorylation and hence the activation of AKT by the protein kinases PDK1 and TORC2. They further show that USP14 is phosphorylated constitutively at Ser432 in PTEN null cells. Finally they report that the phosphorylation of USP14 suppresses the activity of the proteasome in cells."

In addition to strengthening these data in the same way suggested for the result in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>, it is critical to show that phosphorylation is suppressed by MK2206 to be able to conclude that phosphorylation is catalyzed by AKT. Moreover, AKT is not the only protein kinase that is activated downstream of PI 3-kinase. The protein kinases SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3, which are the most similar protein kinases in the human genome to AKT1, 2 and 3, have a similar substrate specificity to AKT and, like AKT, are activated by PDK1 and TORC2. They are therefore candidates to phosphorylate USP14, but their activation is not blocked by MK2206. Protein kinases of the RSK family are also activated by stimulation with growth factors and deactivated by serum starvation and they also have similar substrate specificities to AKT. The consensus sequence for phosphorylation by AKT, as well as SGKs and RSKs is not RxxS as stated in the paper, but RxRxxS and most of the known physiological substrates of these kinases are phosphorylated at this motif. All protein kinases of the AGC and CAMK subfamilies as well as other kinases phosphorylate RxxS sequences. So about 20% of all protein kinases phosphorylate this motif. Ser432 and Ser143 do not lie in RxRxxS sequences, which is a further reason to be cautious."
