Of course, such action sequences are not restricted to either karate or humans.

Two different procedures, or algorithms, have previously been proposed for the production of sequential actions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Houghton and Hartley, 1995</a>). \u2018Response chaining\u2019\u2014in which each action triggers the next like a falling row of dominos (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams, 1984</a>)\u2014is thought to underlie birdsong (<a href=\"#bib4\">Long et al., 2010</a>). Alternatively, all of the actions in a sequence could be prepared in parallel, with an inbuilt order of priority and a winner-take-all competition leading to one action being performed at a time and in the right order. Typing and speaking, for example, are human behaviours that are thought to be implemented through this \u2018competitive queuing\u2019 model (<a href=\"#bib3\">Lashley, 1951</a>). However, it has been difficult to obtain causal evidence that would favour one of these algorithms over the other. Now Seeds et al. demonstrate that competitive queuing produces the sequential grooming behaviour observed in fruit flies."

Indeed, fruit flies use their front or hind legs to clean specific body parts when they are dirty (<a href=\"#bib6\">Szebenyi, 1969</a>). Seeds et al. completely covered flies with dust and observed that each fly preferentially cleaned its eyes first, followed by its antennae, its abdomen, its wings, and finally its thorax. These observations reveal two points: first, grooming in dirty fruit flies is a serial behaviour; and second, it follows a stereotyped order."

To address this question, Seeds et al. first identified populations of neurons that, when activated, were able to trigger grooming of each body part in the absence of dust. This revealed that at the neuronal level as well as at the behavioural level, grooming is comprised of individual, separable units or modules. Then, rather than asking which neurons are involved in the cleaning of each body part, Seeds et al. took a novel approach towards understanding the processes, or computations, that underpin grooming and instead asked: what algorithm does the brain use to generate this sequence?"

However, this was not the case. Instead, Seeds et al. show that it is the stimulus\u2014the presence of dust\u2014that drives cleaning of each body part. The cleaning of different body parts, however, is not only affected by dust, since the grooming of one body part blocks the grooming of body parts that follow later in the cleaning sequence. For example, when Seeds et al. covered a fly with dust and activated its abdomen-grooming module at the same time, the fly cleaned its eyes, antennae and abdomen, but never cleaned its wings and thorax. When eye cleaning was activated, the flies continuously groomed their eyes even though there was dust covering the rest of their bodies too. This demonstrates that the order in which body parts are groomed reflects an underlying set of priorities. That is, higher priority behaviours (such as eye cleaning) suppress lower priority behaviours (such as abdomen cleaning), but not vice versa. Thus, these modules interact in a \u2018suppression hierarchy\u2019."

In a dirty fly, all of the cleaning modules are activated in parallel, but they are prioritized by a suppression hierarchy; a winner-take-all competition then selects the highest priority module, and this module is performed. Once dust is cleaned from that body part, the stimulation of the corresponding module is also removed, and the next most important module is performed."

The dust (yellow dots) activates each cleaning module. When the fly is completely covered with dust, all the modules receive sensory input and are activated in parallel. The \u2018hierarchical suppression\u2019 stage determines the degree of activation for each module (represented by the area of the coloured region in each circle) in order to implement the order of priority. The most active module is selected and the corresponding body part is cleaned, with all other cleaning modules being suppressed. As dust is removed from a body part, the sensory input to that module is reduced (represented by the blunt arrow). Eventually, this module is no longer the most active module and a new module is selected. Multiple iterations of this process produce the sequential grooming behaviour observed in fruit flies."

A module could be high priority either because it is more sensitive to dust or because it inhibits the downstream, \u2018low priority\u2019, modules. However, further study is needed to determine which is the case for grooming behaviour in fruit flies. Furthermore, the cells and circuits that implement grooming behaviour also remain to be identified."

More broadly, it also illustrates the usefulness of studying model organisms, as it is remarkable that the same algorithm that is thought to underpin complex, learned behaviours unique to humans (such as typing and speech) also produces a widespread behaviour that is innate in fruit flies (i.e. grooming). Perhaps this algorithm is evolutionarily ancient and has been elaborated in humans, in which case, understanding computation in fruit flies can indeed teach us about karate."
