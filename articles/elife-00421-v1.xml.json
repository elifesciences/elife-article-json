Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) constitute a widespread group of defensive plant volatiles that convey a herbivory-specific message via their isomeric composition: feeding of the tobacco hornworm <i>Manduca sexta</i> converts (<i>Z</i>)-3- to (<i>E</i>)-2-GLVs thereby attracting predatory insects. Here we show that this isomer-coded message is monitored by ovipositing <i>M. sexta</i> females. We detected the isomeric shift in the host plant <i>Datura wrightii</i> and performed functional imaging in the primary olfactory center of <i>M. sexta</i> females with GLV structural isomers. We identified two isomer-specific regions responding to either (<i>Z</i>)-3- or (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenyl acetate. Field experiments demonstrated that ovipositing <i>Manduca</i> moths preferred (<i>Z</i>)-3-perfumed <i>D. wrightii</i> over (<i>E</i>)-2-perfumed plants. These results show that (<i>E</i>)-2-GLVs and/or specific (<i>Z</i>)-3/(<i>E</i>)-2-ratios provide information regarding host plant attack by conspecifics that ovipositing hawkmoths use for host plant selection."

Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) constitute a widespread group of defensive plant volatiles that convey a herbivory-specific message via their isomeric composition: feeding of the tobacco hornworm <i>Manduca sexta</i> converts (<i>Z</i>)-3- to (<i>E</i>)-2-GLVs thereby attracting predatory insects. Here we show that this isomer-coded message is monitored by ovipositing <i>M. sexta</i> females. We detected the isomeric shift in the host plant <i>Datura wrightii</i> and performed functional imaging in the primary olfactory center of <i>M. sexta</i> females with GLV structural isomers. We identified two isomer-specific regions responding to either (<i>Z</i>)-3- or (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenyl acetate. Field experiments demonstrated that ovipositing <i>Manduca</i> moths preferred (<i>Z</i>)-3-perfumed <i>D. wrightii</i> over (<i>E</i>)-2-perfumed plants. These results show that (<i>E</i>)-2-GLVs and/or specific (<i>Z</i>)-3/(<i>E</i>)-2-ratios provide information regarding host plant attack by conspecifics that ovipositing hawkmoths use for host plant selection."

We recently showed that an enzymatic component of the oral secretions (OS) of <i>M. sexta</i> larvae adds an herbivory-specific feature to the GLV signal. Mechanically damaged leaves of <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i> released large amounts of (<i>Z</i>)-3-GLVs and low amounts of (<i>E</i>)-2-GLVs. However, when the plant was attacked by <i>M. sexta</i> caterpillars or when puncture wounds of plant leaves were treated with <i>M. sexta\u2019s</i> OS, the amount of (<i>E</i>)-2-GLVs released increased, while the amount of (<i>Z</i>)-3-GLVs decreased, resulting in a distinct change in the (<i>Z</i>)-3/(<i>E</i>)-2-ratio of GLV emissions. This herbivore-induced change in the (<i>Z</i>)-3/(<i>E</i>)-2-ratio attracted the generalist hemipteran predator <i>Geocoris</i> spp., which decreased the herbivore load on the plant by feeding on herbivore eggs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</a>)."

                        "text": "Our discovery of a (3<i>Z</i>):(2<i>E</i>)-enal isomerase in the OS of <i>M. sexta</i> larvae raises many questions. Why does <i>Manduca</i> produce an enzyme that generates volatiles which betray the insect to its enemies, and why did evolution not select against this isomerase? The enzyme might be maladaptive and therefore is, or will be, under negative selection. The occurrence of this specific isomerase activity in at least two other lepidopteran species (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</a>) however, suggests that it may have a beneficial function that outweighs the larva\u2019s net costs of maintaining such an enzyme. It is well known that plants exchange information above ground by releasing volatiles into the air (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baldwin, 2010</a>), which can be perceived by insects as well. Insects can use plant derived volatiles for communication by giving the herbivore induced volatile blend a \u2018personal\u2019 note\u2014in our case, by converting (<i>Z</i>)-3-GLVs to their structural isomers and by changing the (<i>Z</i>)-3/(<i>E</i>)-2 ratio. Which message could <i>M. sexta</i> larvae thereby communicate? In this study we hypothesized that the altered GLV emission might serve to reduce the number of competitors on their host plant by informing conspecific ovipositing moths that this plant is already occupied and, possibly, receiving increased predation. Reduced oviposition of <i>Manduca</i> moths in response to feeding damage has been shown in field experiments with <i>M. quinquemaculata</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</a>) as well as under laboratory conditions with <i>M. sexta</i> (<a href=\"#bib83\">Spaethe et al., 2013</a>). Deviating from the previous study, we chose <i>Datura wrightii</i> (Solanaceae) for our experiments. <i>Datura</i> is a highly preferred host plant of both <i>M. sexta</i> and the congeneric <i>M. quinquemaculata</i> for both nectar feeding (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alarc\u00f3n et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Kessler, 2012</a>) and oviposition (<a href=\"#bib83\">Spaethe et al., 2013</a>). Its distribution covers southwestern USA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Avery, 1959</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Munz, 1973</a>) overlapping with the occurrence of both <i>Manduca</i> species. The perennial shrub is repeatedly described to quickly regrow leaves after herbivore damage (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bronstein et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Reisenman et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib70\">2013</a>). Laboratory experiments failed to find reduced oviposition on damaged <i>D. wrightii</i> (<a href=\"#bib70\">Reisenman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Spaethe et al., 2013</a>) suggesting flexibility in oviposition choice of <i>Manduca</i> females. As the previously examined <i>N. attenuata</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gaquerel et al., 2009</a>)<i>, D. wrightii,</i> respond to <i>Manduca</i> herbivore attack by emitting GLVs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hare and Sun, 2011</a>). While we investigated GLV emission during the day when focusing on the diurnal egg predator <i>Geocoris</i> ssp., <i>Manduca</i> moths oviposit at twilight and night (<a href=\"#bib55\">Madden and Chamberlin, 1945</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lingren et al., 1977</a>). Therefore, we decided to collect volatiles during these times instead. We expected the shift to occur also during the night, as in several plant species GLV emission has been shown to occur also in the dark period (<a href=\"#bib54\">Loughrin et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Arimura et al., 2008</a>), and the respective shift in the (<i>Z</i>)-3/(<i>E</i>)-2-ratio is caused by <i>M. sexta</i> oral secretions and not by the plant itself (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</a>). However, volatile emissions vary with light regime (<a href=\"#bib33\">Halitschke et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">De Moraes et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gouinguene and Turlings, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Morker and Roberts, 2011</a>), and we therefore chose two nocturnal light conditions differing by moonlight intensity to examine whether light intensity affects GLV emission in <i>D. wrightii</i>. We performed functional imaging in the antennal lobe of female <i>M. sexta</i> moths asking whether (<i>Z</i>)-3- and (<i>E</i>)-2-structural isomers of any of the tested GLVs can be discriminated by the olfactory system. In classical host recognition experiments the Colorado potato beetle <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</i> has been shown to recognize and avoid altered ratios of (<i>Z</i>)-3- and (<i>E</i>)-2-GLVs emitted by its host plant <i>Solanum tuberosum</i> (<a href=\"#bib90\">Visser and Av\u00e9, 1978</a>). Furthermore, enantioselectivity has been reported for projection neurons in the female AL of <i>M. sexta</i> in response to (+)- and (\u2212)-linalool (<a href=\"#bib68\">Reisenman et al., 2004</a>). Thus, we hypothesized that <i>M. sexta</i> females would be able to differentiate between (<i>Z</i>)-3 and (<i>E</i>)-2-isomers of at least one GLV. If so, ovipositing <i>M. sexta</i> should avoid plants with increased levels of (<i>E</i>)-2-GLVs as they indicate host plants with increased larval feeding competition and predation risk (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</a>). Here we show by combining field studies with neurophysiological imaging techniques that (i) OS-induced <i>D. wrightii</i> plants have altered (<i>Z</i>)-3/(<i>E</i>)-2-ratios also during the night under both laboratory and field conditions, (ii) <i>Manduca</i> females detect and discriminate the (<i>Z</i>)-3- and (<i>E</i>)-2-isomers and (iii) show ovipositional preference for high (<i>Z</i>)-3/(<i>E</i>)-2-GLV ratios."

Odor-evoked calcium changes in response to exposure to the pure (<i>E</i>)-2- and (<i>Z</i>)-3-isomers of hexenal, hexenol and hexenyl acetate led to activity in discrete regions corresponding to specific glomeruli in the AL of <i>M. sexta</i> females (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Aldehyde and alcohol structural isomers activated one single specific region (region of interest 2 [ROI 2], green), with significantly stronger responses to the (<i>E</i>)-2- compared with (<i>Z</i>)-3-isomers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenyl acetate and its structural isomer activated three different regions in the female AL: a significantly (<i>Z</i>)-3-specific (ROI 3, blue), a significantly (<i>E</i>)-2-specific (ROI 4, pink) and an isomer-unspecific region (ROI 1, grey, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The differences in activation patterns caused by stimulations with (<i>Z</i>)-3- or (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenyl acetate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) strongly suggest that the two odors activated OSNs expressing different sets of odorant receptor types on the female antennae.

Although quantitative differences in light intensities between the two experimental nights were not detectable with the instruments available on site, they were obvious to the human eye.

When comparing the ratio of ROI activation, we did not find any difference between the mixtures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This result is not surprising when taking the different response characteristics of ROI 3 and 4 into account. Calcium activity of ROI 4 in response to mixtures with increasing percentages of the (<i>E</i>)-2-isomer were dose-dependent, whereas the activation of ROI 3 to the same mixtures resembled more an \u2018on\u2013off\u2019 mechanism and was thus solely dependent on the presence of the (<i>Z</i>)-3-isomer, leading to a constant bias towards (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenyl acetate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5B and 6B</a>).

(<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenyl acetate is a rather ubiquitously occurring plant volatile, which is released in large amounts after damage irrespective of its origin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arimura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Mumm and Dicke, 2010</a>). Electrophysiological experiments revealed that this compound elicited many responses in OSNs on the female <i>M. sexta</i> antenna: 60% of the tested sensilla (<a href=\"#bib83\">Spaethe et al., 2013</a>) as well as 21 of 34 cells in the female AL (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kuebler et al., 2011</a>) responded to this compound. (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenyl acetate, in contrast, has rarely been reported in insect-plant interactions (<a href=\"#bib92\">Whitman and Eller, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Quiroz and Niemeyer, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Williams et al., 2010</a>), aside from its release among other GLVs after larval feeding of <i>M. sexta</i> on <i>N. attenuata</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</a>) as an indication of actual larval damage. Thus, the presence of each structural isomer contains specific information but at different levels of resolution and in different contexts. In the case of (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenyl acetate, the detected signal might also be relevant in long-range host location and host choice. Information about (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenyl acetate gained by ROI 4 in a dose-dependent fashion should, on the other hand, be most valuable at a short distance to the plant, possibly to locate the best spot for oviposition depending on the actual amounts emitted by different plant sites or to choose among neighboring plants with different levels of (conspecific) herbivory."

Augmenting the volatile emission of a potato host plant with the single GLV components (<i>Z</i>)-3- or (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenol, (<i>E</i>)-2-hexanal or 1-hexanol resulted in a disruption of the orientation of <i>L. decemlineata</i> to the potato plant. Further studies found neurons specifically responding to these GLVs both at the periphery and in the AL of <i>L. decemlineata</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">De Jong and Visser, 1988a</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">1988b</a>). In the case of the oriental fruit moth, <i>Grapholita molesta,</i> the ratio of a minor compound to the remaining components of a plant-derived synthetic mixture determined behavioral acceptance of this mixture, which could be associated with the response of two glomeruli in the female AL (<a href=\"#bib64\">Pi\u00f1ero et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Najar-Rodriguez et al., 2010</a>). We found that ovipositing <i>Manduca</i> moths distinguished between different (<i>Z</i>)-3/(<i>E</i>)-2-ratios and that they used these volatile cues to choose oviposition sites associated with less feeding competition and predation. However, independent of whether the mixtures tested were rather complex in their composition (9:1 vs 1:1 ratios), or less complex (only (<i>Z</i>)-3-GLVs vs only (<i>E</i>)-2-GLVs), or consisted of only a single compound ((<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenyl acetate vs (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenyl acetate) ovipositing <i>Manduca</i> moths continuously made a choice and always preferred the side of the plant that smelled more of (<i>Z</i>)-3-GLVs, or less of (<i>E</i>)-2-GLVs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). From our results we cannot conclude whether a complex GLV bouquet of different ratios provides more reliable information than do single compounds, but our results demonstrate that by adding a single component to the volatile bouquet of native <i>D. wrightii</i> plants one can alter the choice of ovipositing <i>Manduca</i> moths."

During oviposition <i>M. sexta</i> females might encounter the herbivory-specific signal, but can never experience the reward of oviposition success associated with it. A <i>M. sexta</i> larva feeding on plants, however, is continuously surrounded by GLVs emitted from wounded plants and more importantly encounters almost continuously a low (<i>Z</i>)-3/(<i>E</i>)-2-ratio caused by its own oral secretions. The retention of odor memory learned at the larval stage onto the adult stage has been shown to occur in <i>M. sexta</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blackiston et al., 2008</a>). However, in such a case you would rather expect a preference for OS-elicited bouquets, as the larva grew up in these.

Our results show that the AL, the first odor processing center of the insect brain, has the capacity to resolve the composition of GLV blends as emitted by highly relevant host plants. Correspondingly, gravid females make an informed choice. They prefer oviposition sites with reduced predation and competition risks for their offspring, as indicated by the plant volatile bouquet. Future work will reveal whether increasing amounts of (<i>E</i>)-2-GLVs or rather changes in the (<i>Z</i>)-3/(<i>E</i>)-2-ratio at the background of other host odors provide crucial information for female <i>Manduca</i> moths."

This area is part of the native habitat of the tobacco and tomato hawkmoths <i>Manduca sexta</i> and <i>M. quinqemaculata</i>. Eggs of both species were counted for this experiment. We selected between 15 and 17 plants of two native populations of <i>D. wrightii</i> plants, which were located close to the Lytle Preserve research station. All plants were carefully inspected and oviposited <i>Manduca</i> eggs were removed prior the experiment. On each experimental day two mixes were tested in a paired design: every evening before sunset (at around 5 pm) cotton swabs were dipped into the GLV-scented lanolin pastes and stuck onto two opposing branches of one <i>Datura</i> plant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). This paired design was chosen to minimize the effect that different numbers of flowers or different grades of leaf damage might have on the oviposition behavior of the moths. On the next day freshly laid <i>Manduca</i> eggs were counted in a defined area on the plant, approx 30 cm around the scented cotton swabs and afterwards removed. Treatment sides were switched every day. Plants with no oviposited eggs (isomers N = 36, ratios N = 15, acetates N = 18) were excluded prior to the statistical analysis. The GLV-scented lanolin pastes were prepared by warming up lanolin and adding different GLV-mixtures to the liquefied lanolin paste shortly before it solidified again. The GLV mixes used are described in <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>. A comparison of emission rates and (<i>Z</i>)-3/(<i>E</i>)-2-ratios emitted from cotton swabs and w + OS and w + w treated <i>D. wrightii</i> plants is shown in <a href=\"#tbl4\">Tables 4 and 5</a>."

The present manuscript merges Baldwin\u2019s field program in which wild hawkmoths are major selective agents on <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i> plants, with Hansson\u2019s lab-oriented program of using <i>Manduca sexta</i> as a model system for olfactory coding, perception, and behaviour. This is an exciting prospect for chemical ecologists, synergizing the potential of these model systems in the field. The premise is that a subtle shift in stereochemistry provides information for the insects (friends and foes alike) interacting with wounded/induced plants."

Thus, care must be taken when comparing our results with those of Visser &amp; de Jong.

The elicitor of the altered (Z)/(E)-ratio is in the oral secretions of M. sexta larvae. Consequently, as long as the plants respond with the release of GLVs, the expected shift in the (<i>Z</i>)/(<i>E</i>)-ratio should occur. Hare (2007) reported differences in emission of induced volatiles between glandular and non-glandular phenotypes of <i>D. wrightii</i>. He, however, collected volatiles 48 h after damage and focused on the emission of sesquiterpenes. In the only assessed GLV, (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenyl acetate, no difference was observed as the (<i>Z</i>)/(<i>E</i>)-ratio is in the oral secretions of <i>M. sexta</i> larvae. Since we were interested in the GLV emission, we collected the treated leaves immediately after they were damaged, which is the ecologically relevant time to do so, as this GLV emission provides ovipositing hawkmoths with accurate information about intraspecific competition and potential predation risk for their offspring."

Controlled laboratory experiments with each species could unambiguously reveal whether both species use the signal.

The occurrence of ovipositing moths is barely predictable both in time and location. To compare the treatments on one plant, the feeding larvae would need to be restrained to a certain area to allow the evaluation of a distinct radius. Furthermore, the number of larvae previously reared on <i>D. wrightii</i> needed for this experiment would probably exceed the scope of the field station."

This ability necessitates specific OSNs to distinguish between the emitted (<i>E</i>)-2- and (<i>Z</i>)-3-conformers. We employed functional imaging to investigate the spatial patterns of glomerular activation in the antennal lobe. This technique is very powerful as it visualizes the complete input to the antennal lobe, i.e., the responses of thousands of OSNs at the same time. Due to the principles of OSN targeting, i.e., that OSNs expressing the same receptor type innervate one and the same glomerulus (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gao et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Vosshall, 2000</a>), the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging technique reveals the involvement of different OSN types in an odor response. Electrophysiological experiments like single-sensillum or intracellular recordings show responses of single neurons and can provide information about information detection and processing via their response characteristics. This, however, was not the focus of our study. Since the <i>Manduca</i> AL receives input from roughly 250,000 OSNs from more than 20,000 sensilla, the search for specific OSN types by peripheral recordings would result in hitting neurons by chance to find differentially responding cells. Imaging provides the best of two worlds: specificity and completeness. Instead of registering the activity of single neurons, the specific response of the complete OSN population can be observed after a single odor stimulation."

We focused on the sophisticated evaluation of host quality as it is likely to occur in nature, where plants are rarely free of damage or herbivory. We did not perform any sham controls, because they are not the focus of our study. One can speculate that a sham control would have received considerably more eggs than our treated plants, but how would that relate to the scientific question?"
