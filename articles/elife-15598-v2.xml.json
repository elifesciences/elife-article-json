                    "text": "The essential process of protein secretion is achieved by the ubiquitous Sec machinery. In prokaryotes, the drive for translocation comes from ATP hydrolysis by the cytosolic motor-protein SecA, in concert with the proton motive force (PMF). However, the mechanism through which ATP hydrolysis by SecA is coupled to directional movement through SecYEG is unclear. Here, we combine all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with single molecule FRET and biochemical assays. We show that ATP binding by SecA causes opening of the SecY-channel at long range, while substrates at the SecY-channel entrance feed back to regulate nucleotide exchange by SecA. This two-way communication suggests a new, unifying 'Brownian ratchet' mechanism, whereby ATP binding and hydrolysis bias the direction of polypeptide diffusion. The model represents a solution to the problem of transporting inherently variable substrates such as polypeptides, and may underlie mechanisms of other motors that translocate proteins and nucleic acids."

                    "text": "The essential process of protein secretion is achieved by the ubiquitous Sec machinery. In prokaryotes, the drive for translocation comes from ATP hydrolysis by the cytosolic motor-protein SecA, in concert with the proton motive force (PMF). However, the mechanism through which ATP hydrolysis by SecA is coupled to directional movement through SecYEG is unclear. Here, we combine all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with single molecule FRET and biochemical assays. We show that ATP binding by SecA causes opening of the SecY-channel at long range, while substrates at the SecY-channel entrance feed back to regulate nucleotide exchange by SecA. This two-way communication suggests a new, unifying 'Brownian ratchet' mechanism, whereby ATP binding and hydrolysis bias the direction of polypeptide diffusion. The model represents a solution to the problem of transporting inherently variable substrates such as polypeptides, and may underlie mechanisms of other motors that translocate proteins and nucleic acids."

Many proteins that are made inside the cell need to be exported in order to do their job. In most organisms, a specialised transport motor that sits inside the membrane, known as 'Sec', carries out this export process. Sec recognises proteins that need to be exported and pushes them across the membrane and out of the cell. The energy required to do this comes from the cell's universal power source, a molecule called ATP."

Pre-protein substrates with an N-terminal signal sequence are targeted to the translocon in an unfolded state (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arkowitz et al., 1993</a>), whereupon they are threaded across (secretion) or transferred laterally into the membrane (insertion). Protein translocation can occur either co-translationally following emergence of the nascent chain from the ribosome, or post-translationally. In prokaryotes, secretion is mostly post-translational (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hartl et al., 1990</a>): substrates are recognised by the cytosolic ATPase SecA (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lill et al., 1989</a>), which targets them to SecYEG and then drives them through the protein channel using energy derived from ATP binding and hydrolysis, and the trans-membrane proton motive force (PMF) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brundage et al., 1990</a>)."

SecY and SecA interact tightly, with the 2HF from SecA protruding into the SecY channel, and a long loop between TMs 6\u20137 of SecY buried inside SecA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The structure also revealed conformational changes within both SecYEG and SecA. In SecA, a large movement of the PPXD activates the ATPase (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gold et al., 2013</a>) and is thought to clamp the substrate in place, while in SecYEG the LG opens, causing a widening of the channel through which translocating substrates pass (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zimmer et al., 2008</a>). Presumably, these changes prime the complex for intercalation of the pre-protein: however, they represent only a single snapshot in the dynamic process of protein translocation, regulated ultimately by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. More recently, several electron microscopy structures have been solved for the Sec machinery in complex with the ribosome and nascent chains (<a href=\"#bib52\">Park et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gogala et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib55\">Pfeffer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Voorhees and Hegde, 2016</a>). However, whilst these structures reveal key features of the interactions between components, they do not provide mechanistic insights of how protein translocation <i>per se</i>\u00a0occurs. Here, we take a different approach: using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identify key structural differences between the ATP- and ADP-bound complexes, and combine these with biochemical and single molecule FRET analyses. Together, the results allow us to propose a model for ATP-dependent transport, in which two-way communication between the NBS of SecA and the channel of SecY biases the direction of random substrate diffusion, in a 'Brownian ratchet' mechanism."

Conserved helicase features are shown as coloured sticks and numbered as in <i>T. maritima</i>: Glu99 of Walker A (helicase motif Ia); Glu253 of Walker B (DEAD box of helicase motif II); Thr416 of helicase motif III; and Arg574 (\u2018arginine finger\u2019) of helicase motif VI. A black dotted line marks the distance between Arg574 and Glu99. (<b>B</b>) The same view as in panel A, but for post-microsecond simulation snapshots in the open, part-open and closed simulations. Of note are Arg574 and Glu99, which remain distant in the open and part-open simulations (ATP), but come close enough to form a salt bridge in the closed simulation (ADP). In helicases, this conserved arginine finger on motif VI has been shown to couple ATPase activity with substrate binding (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hall et al., 1998</a>), underlining its importance in SecA. After the Arg574 to Glu99 salt bridge has formed in the ADP simulations, the Walker A motif is bought into contact with a conserved threonine (Thr416) in helicase motif III, which in the helicase family has been shown to use ATP binding to create an RNA binding site (<a href=\"#bib3\">Banroques et al., 2010</a>). This threonine communicates directly with the SecA DEAD box\u2014providing a likely route forsignal transmission of\u00a0ATP hydrolysis away from the NBS towards the polypeptide binding sites. (<b>C</b>) Minimum distance analysis between residues Glu99 and Arg574 of SecA across the simulation data confirms that a Glu99-Arg574 interaction is formed in 4/5 of the ADP simulations, whereas it is absent in all 5 ATP simulations. Interestingly, the ADP simulation that does not find this salt bridge is the same simulation in which the SecY LG samples the part-open state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Thus, it appears that nucleotide dependent formation and breaking of the Glu99-Arg574 salt bridge is involved in the coupling process leading ultimately to the respective closure and opening of the channel."

Numbers in red show percentages of the total intensity for the bands in the lane. As expected, fluorophores on the A103 (A) position run in band F1 (samples 3 &amp; 7), while fluorophores on V353 (V) are distributed between bands F2 and F3 (samples 4 &amp; 8). Protein labelled with a single dye at both positions (samples 2 and 6) shows both positions labelled equally (samples 2 &amp; 6).

Therefore, we can rule out an unexpected asymmetric dye loading on the two sites that would skew the FRET results. (<b>D</b>) Analysis of SecY**EG PLs by trypsin proteolysis, results shown without (-) and with (+) trypsin. Fluorescence quantification indicates that the band corresponding to full-length SecYEG accounts for 54% of the total signal in the '+' lane, once the lower molecular weight bands in the '-' lane are corrected for. This is equivalent to 46% outward facing SecYs: consistent, within error, with previous reports that show equal amounts of inward- and outward-facing SecYEG (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Schulze et al., 2014</a>).

Data are fitted to a tight binding equation and show a difference in apparent FRET efficiency at saturation, but no measurable difference in affinity. Due to variability in protein preps, labelling efficiencies and reconstitutions, variation in the total magnitude of the signal was greater than the individual differences between ADP and AMPPNP. To account for this, we calculated the differences in FRET pairwise for each data set (inset). Error bars represent the standard error of mean (SEM) of five replicates, and the dotted blue line represents where the data would cluster if the ADP and AMPPNP titrations gave the same signal."

In total, therefore, only ~12.5% of all SecYEG molecules are expected to respond to the presence of translocation partners. Two of these three problems are obviated by using single molecule FRET: (ii) is solved by using high lipid to protein ratio (see Methods for details) and extruding the PLs to 100 nm, such that only a single copy of SecY is present in each PL (<a href=\"#bib13\">Deville et al., 2011</a>); and (iii) is solved because only particles containing a single donor and a single acceptor are used for analysis (see Methods and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Because we use intact PLs, problem (i) still remains even at the single molecule level.

Three Gaussian curves are required to describe all the data (see <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). To carry out the fitting, the parameters of the high FRET peak (position at E\u00a0=0.76 and width of 0.24) were first estimated from a single Gaussian fit to the 'SecYEG alone' distributions. The complete data set was then fitted globally to three Gaussians, with the position and width of the high FRET peak fixed, and all other parameters (the amplitudes of all three peaks and the positions and widths of the remaining two peaks) were allowed to float. Next, the positions and widths of all three peaks were fixed while the amplitudes were unshared to allow variation between individual data sets. Finally, the positions and widths of the two lower FRET peaks were allowed to vary individually, along with all the amplitudes, to confirm that the model was not over-constrained.

(<b>C</b>) Interconversion between the closed and open states on a timescale faster than our TIRF data collection (0.2 s per frame) could, in principle, give rise to an apparent third FRET peak due purely to averaging. In order to evaluate whether the intermediate peak (E\u00a0=\u00a00.59) corresponds to a real, part open state, or results from averaging of 2 distinct states during ATP hydrolysis, we simulated two-state traces (with FRET efficiencies of 0.76 and 0.45) with interconversion between the two states.

The ADP-bound histogram is in good agreement with the experimental data (compare blue bars with <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). However, simulated ATP turnover does not recapitulate the experimental data (compare red bars with panel <b>A</b>): only a slight shift is seen of the high FRET peak, and no intermediate FRET feature appears. This suggests that in the case of slow ATP turnover, the intermediate FRET peak cannot be due to averaging and thus represents a genuine state."

The simulations demonstrate that the double cysteine mutation used to crosslink the LG of SecY does not prevent the nucleotide-dependent conformational changes observed in the wild-type complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

The primary and secondary trypsin cleavage sites \u2013 between TMs 6\u20137 and TMs 8\u20139, respectively \u2013 are also indicated. Cleavage with trypsin yields two major fragments (F1 and F2), with F2 partially cleaved again (into F3 and F4). Note that if a disulphide bond is formed (dashed line), F1/F2 and F1/F3 will not separate by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and will resemble full length SecY. (<b>C</b>)\u00a0Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE of a trypsin proteolysis experiment, to test the degree of crosslinking of DDM-solubilised SecY<sub>LG</sub>EG. Full-length SecY runs at ~32 kDa, and the primary SecY trypsin fragments at ~19 and 15 kDa. The first lane (1) contains a molecular weight ladder. Other lanes, from left to right, contain: wild-type SecYEG, untreated (2); treated with 0.75 \u00b5g.ml<sup>-1</sup> porcine trypsin (3); or treated with trypsin after incubation with 100 mM DTT (4). Lanes 5\u201312 contain SecY<sub>LG</sub>EG alone (5) or treated with trypsin following incubation with various concentrations of DTT as indicated in the panel. The full-length wild-type SecY is fully cleaved both with and without DTT. In contrast, the oxidised SecY<sub>LG</sub>EG (no DTT) digest resembles that of the intact (no trypsin) wild-type SecY, and is progressively more cleaved with increasing DTT concentration, until it is almost fully cleaved at 100 mM DTT. The results are consistent with essentially complete disulphide bond formation. Note that fragment F4 runs at ~12 kDa. As its cleavage site is unaffected by the disulphide, it is present in the same amount in all lanes that have been treated with trypsin. Note also that reconstitution into PLs occludes the trypsin cleavage site of inward-facing SecYs, so the degree of crosslinking for SecY<sub>LG</sub>EG cannot be determined in a lipid environment.

Reaction lanes show a western blot of the protease-protected pOA after a 30 min translocation reaction. The -ATP lane is a negative control, using the same components but lacking ATP. The 10% lanes show the starting material, untreated with protease K (1/10th the amount loaded). As reported previously (<a href=\"#bib15\">du Plessis et al., 2009</a>) the SecY<sub>LG</sub>EG mutant is severely compromised in translocation, but activity is partially restored by addition of DTT."

For example, poly-glycine regions diffuse freely and rapidly backwards and forth (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bauer et al., 2014</a>), while charged amino acids, especially positively charged, are excluded (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nouwen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Liang et al., 2012</a>).

Given that the aperture of the SecY channel is nucleotide-dependent, we thought it might form a choke point for diffusion of bulky or structured regions of a substrate sequence: in the ADP-bound state, only uncharged, unfolded stretches of polypeptide may pass; whereas the ATP-bound state is less restrictive (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>)."

For the closed structure however, while AGAGA readily passes through the channel, the larger substrates \u2013 especially AWAWA \u2013 are substantially retarded (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>).

However the mechanism of translocation\u2014how ATP turnover by SecA drives unfolded pre-proteins across the membrane through SecY\u2014is not yet understood. At present, the most favoured model posits that substrate is pushed through the channel by the 2HF, with ATP providing energy <i>via</i> a power stroke (<a href=\"#bib18\">Erlandson et al., 2008</a>). This model has recently been updated to allow free diffusion of some stretches of less bulky residues (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bauer et al., 2014</a>); however, as we have argued previously (<a href=\"#bib11\">Collinson et al., 2015</a>), evidence for the power stroke itself is lacking. Indeed, it is not clear from the structure of SecYEG-SecA where the 2HF would move, and how it could selectively bind and move both hydrophobic and charged regions of substrate. Furthermore, as immobilisation of the 2HF inside the channel does not prevent translocation (<a href=\"#bib70\">Whitehouse et al., 2012</a>), any 'power-stroke' conformational change would have to be extremely subtle."

In the absence of blockages, the polypeptide diffuses freely backwards and forwards through the closed (ADP-bound) channel (state (i) in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). When a region of polypeptide that cannot pass through reaches the channel entrance (state (ii) \u2013 block region as green circle), it triggers nucleotide exchange \u2013 probably <i>via</i> the 2HF (state (iii)). This causes a brief opening of the channel (iv), allowing the polypeptide to diffuse freely, before ATP is hydrolysed and the channel closes ((ii) or (v) depending on the position of the block). Back-diffusion is restricted because bulky regions on the periplasmic side do not trigger nucleotide exchange (vi): the whole scheme therefore acts as a ratchet promoting translocation. In essence, the bias for forward directionality arises because the energy transducing (ATP dependent) step \u2013 which resolves channel blockages \u2013 happens at the cytosolic, but not the periplasmic, surface. Moreover, the irreversibility of the initiation and completion steps would ensure forward directionality: once the signal sequence makes contact with the lipid bilayer (<a href=\"#bib49\">McKnight et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hizlan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Corey et al., 2016</a>) it remains firmly fixed there, and is not cleaved off until most or all of the protein has crossed (<a href=\"#bib35\">Josefsson and Randall, 1981</a>). This ensures that backward motion of the polypeptide does not lead to aborted transport."

Subsequently, the substrate is free to diffuse backwards or forwards (i) until it reaches a block (green circle) at the entrance (ii) or exit (vi) to the channel. A block at the entrance triggers nucleotide exchange (iii), which leads to opening of the LG (iv). The wider channel permits diffusion of the blocked region of substrate within the pore, until ATP hydrolysis recloses the channel, trapping the block either outside (v) or inside (ii) the membrane. This cycle produces a net forwards driving force because blocks at the channel exit (vi) do not trigger nucleotide exchange and channel opening; the substrate is therefore ratcheted in one direction. Once the entire chain emerges from the channel it can no longer diffuse backwards and cleavage of the signal sequence is all that remains (completion)."

This selective response to differently sized peptides is very interesting: in the context of general protein transport, regions of folded secondary structure or stretches of polypeptide chain enriched in bulky amino acids are likely to occur (<a href=\"#bib52\">Park et al., 2014</a>). These could be considerably larger than two tryptophans as in the peptide AWCWA. This, together with the fact that we see such variability in the width across LG with ATP bound (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), suggests a degree of gradation in the mechanism: the larger and bulkier a region of substrate, the less likely it is to spontaneously cross the channel, but the more likely it is to induce nucleotide exchange. Indeed, at its core our model only requires a single open state to function: perhaps the most open state is reserved to conduct the largest substrates, after multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis."

Regulated constriction of the channel, therefore, may offer a unifying concept for protein transport more generally, <i>e.g.</i> in mitochondrial and chloroplast protein import. Furthermore, two-way communication between the ATPase NBS and the polymer binding site over distances ranging from 2 to 15 nm has been observed for several molecular motors such as RecA-like helicases (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mancini et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kainov et al., 2008</a>) and AAA+ dynein\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib38\">Kon et al., 2009</a>).

The conclusion is that an interplay between pre-protein, nucleotide state of the SecA ATPase, and conformation of the SecY channel act to bias the directionality of pre-protein diffusion toward the periplasm. In this model, the bias arises from the fact that pre-protein bulkiness is preferentially detected (and subsequently relieved) at the cytosolic side of the channel. The key elements of this model are four-fold. First, MD simulations, bulk FRET, and single-molecule FRET studies suggest that widening of the lateral gate, and hence the pore diameter, of the SecY channel is favored by the ATP state of SecA. Second, a narrow SecY lateral gate enforced by a disulfide bridge can communicate to SecA to slow ADP release (and hence ATP binding). Third, steered MD simulations suggest that bulky peptides have more trouble crossing a narrow SecY pore than less bulky peptides. Fourth, bulky peptides crosslinked to the SecA two-helix finger at the cytosolic opening of the SecY channel communicate to hasten ADP release. When combined with earlier observations, this leads to a model where non-bulky stretches of peptide can move through the narrow SecY, bulky residues on the periplasmic side cannot backslide effectively through the channel, while bulky residues near the cytosolic side trigger channel widening to permit their diffusion through the channel."

The authors directly crosslinked peptide to it, which seemed to me not a good way of determining if it is 'sensing' peptide since the putative 'sensor' is now perturbed. Would it not be better to choose a nearby site (and one further away as a negative control) to crosslink the peptides? This way, one can see if the 2HF is really able to detect peptides in its proximity. Alternatively, perhaps some other nearby region of SecA (or SecY) is doing the actual sensing. Or perhaps the authors are imagining a scenario where the extra space occupied by the bulkier peptide forces the 2HF into a different position. Either way, I can't quite see how crosslinking peptide to the 2HF is mimicking preprotein bulkiness, and a better explanation of what the authors think is going on here (and any alternatives that remain to be tested) is warranted."

Is there evidence for this or is this just speculation? It is not an entirely trivial point because the new SecA-SecY structure with a putative signal peptide (Li et al., Nature, 2016) suggests that the signal binds between helices 2 and 7. Thus, if it stays there, the SecY might not be able to close in the ADP state (although probably beyond the scope of this paper, an MD simulation with the signal bound at this site would certainly be interesting). Some discussion of this new work and how it might relate to the model is warranted. If a bound signal essentially prevents lateral gate closing, it would seem that a key part of the model would need to be revised."

The evidence suggesting that the presence of nascent substrate proteins in the channel influences the rate of nucleotide exchange by SecA is similarly convincing. The authors also suggest that the 2HF of SecA senses the presence of a preprotein in the channel and that this can be transmitted back to the nucleotide binding site. The interaction of preproteins with the 2HF is required for translocation, and the 2HF has therefore been implicated in physically pushing preproteins through SecYEG. Although it isn't clear from the data that the 2HF is the <i>only</i> feature of SecA that senses the presence of preprotein, the evidence clearly suggests that the 2HF is involved in sensing the presence of preprotein."

It is possible that the crystal structure by serendipity is positioned at a high-energy (possibly even the transition state, which would be very interesting and informative). If so, no barrier-crossing is required, which would be consistent with the nanosecond timescale observed. This should be further examined. Would we qualitatively see the same effect if a different force field (Amber or Charmm) is used? What happens if the nucleotide binding site is unoccupied in the simulations?

Would it not be better to choose a nearby site (and one further away as a negative control) to crosslink the peptides? This way, one can see if the 2HF is really able to detect peptides in its proximity. Alternatively, perhaps some other nearby region of SecA (or SecY) is doing the actual sensing. Or perhaps the authors are imagining a scenario where the extra space occupied by the bulkier peptide forces the 2HF into a different position. Either way, I can't quite see how crosslinking peptide to the 2HF is mimicking preprotein bulkiness, and a better explanation of what the authors think is going on here (and any alternatives that remain to be tested) is warranted.</i>"

The authors also suggest that the 2HF of SecA senses the presence of a preprotein in the channel and that this can be transmitted back to the nucleotide binding site. The interaction of preproteins with the 2HF is required for translocation, and the 2HF has therefore been implicated in physically pushing preproteins through SecYEG.
