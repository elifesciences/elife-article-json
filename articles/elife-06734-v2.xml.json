Atg14L, the mammalian ortholog of Atg14 in yeast and a critical regulator of autophagy, mediates the production PtdIns3P to initiate the formation of autophagosomes. However, it is not clear how Atg14L is regulated. In this study, we demonstrate that ubiquitination and degradation of Atg14L is controlled by ZBTB16-Cullin3-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, we show that a wide range of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands and agonists regulate the levels of Atg14L through ZBTB16. In addition, we show that the activation of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition of GPCR reduces the accumulation of misfolded proteins and protects against behavior dysfunction in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Our study demonstrates a common molecular mechanism by which the activation of GPCRs leads to the suppression of autophagy and a pharmacological strategy to activate autophagy in the CNS for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

Atg14L, the mammalian ortholog of Atg14 in yeast and a critical regulator of autophagy, mediates the production PtdIns3P to initiate the formation of autophagosomes. However, it is not clear how Atg14L is regulated. In this study, we demonstrate that ubiquitination and degradation of Atg14L is controlled by ZBTB16-Cullin3-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, we show that a wide range of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands and agonists regulate the levels of Atg14L through ZBTB16. In addition, we show that the activation of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition of GPCR reduces the accumulation of misfolded proteins and protects against behavior dysfunction in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Our study demonstrates a common molecular mechanism by which the activation of GPCRs leads to the suppression of autophagy and a pharmacological strategy to activate autophagy in the CNS for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

The activation of GPCRs has been shown to lead to diverse physiological responses. Zhang et al. now show that when any of a wide range of different signaling molecules bind to the GPCRs, the receptors activate a protein called ZBTB16 that leads to the degradation of Atg14L to inhibit autophagy."

The challenge now is to identify appropriate GPCRs that can be safely manipulated to control the levels of autophagy in the brain in order to reduce the levels of the misfolded proteins that cause neurodegeneration."

In multi-cellular organisms, autophagy serves important functions in mediating intracellular protein degradation under normal nutritional conditions. Defects in autophagy lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the central nervous system, an organ that is protected from nutritional deprivation under physiological conditions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hara et al., 2006</a>). How cells regulate autophagy under normal nutritional condition is an important unsolved question in the field. In mammalian cells, adaptor protein Atg14L/Barkor in complex with Vps34, the catalytic subunit of the class III PI3K, and the regulatory proteins Beclin 1 and p150, function as a key driver in orchestrating the formation of autophagosomes by regulating the formation of Vps34 complexes and for targeting to the isolation membrane involved in initiating the formation of autophagosomes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Obara and Ohsumi, 2011</a>). However, it remains to be determined how Atg14L is regulated in response to extracellular signaling."

In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which ZBTB16 regulates autophagy. We show that CUL3-ZBTB16 regulates autophagy by mediating the proteasomal degradation of Atg14L, which is controlled by GPCR ligands through GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that inhibiting GPCRs by pharmacological means leads to the activation of autophagy in the central nervous system (CNS) and ameliorates neural dysfunction in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Our study identified a common mechanism by which multiple GPCR ligands mediate autophagy through regulating the levels of Vps34 complexes and a pharmacological strategy to activate autophagy in the CNS to inhibit neural dysfunction induced by the accumulation of misfolded proteins."

Since PtdIns3P is produced by Vps34 complexes, the class III PtdIns3 kinase, we hypothesize that ZBTB16 might affect the levels/activity of Vps34 complexes. Although ZBTB16 is known to be involved in regulation of transcription in nucleus (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mathew et al., 2012</a>), ZBTB16 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib3\">Costoya et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), suggesting that ZBTB16 might have a non-nuclear function. To test this hypothesis, we screened for the effects of ZBTB16 knockdown on the levels of Atg14L, Vps34, Beclin1, and UVRAG. Interestingly, we found that knockdown of ZBTB16 led to specific increases in the levels of Atg14L, a key component of Vps34 complexes specifically involved in regulating autophagy, and corresponding increases in the ratio of LC3II/tubulin and a reduction in the levels of p62, indicating the activation of autophagy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Matsunaga et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Zhong et al., 2009</a>). Overexpression of Atg14L has been shown to induce autophagy under normal nutritional conditions (<a href=\"#bib21\">Matsunaga et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Fan et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, the levels of Beclin1, Vps34, UVRAG were not affected by the knockdown of ZBTB16 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We compared the changes of LC3II/tubulin in the presence or absence of chloroquine (CQ), an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation. We found that compared to that of ZBTB16 knockdown or CQ treatment, the presence of CQ with ZBTB16 knockdown led to a further increase in the ratio of LC3II/tubulin, suggesting that ZBTB16 deficiency led to an increase in autophagic flux (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Indeed, we found that serum starvation of HeLa cells for as short as half an hour induced the degradation of ZBTB16 and a concomitant increase in the levels of ATG14L with no effect on its mRNA, while the levels of Beclin1 and Vps34 showed no significant change (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Similar changes in the levels of Atg14L and ZBTB16 were found in multiple cell lines, including 7721, SK-OV-3, H4, and HCT116 cells, upon serum removal (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>). On the other hand, no such change in Atg14L or ZBTB16 was observed even after removal of glucose or amino acids (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013G</a>). These results suggest that ZBTB16 and Atg14L are regulated by serum factors rather than the availability of nutrients, such as glucose and amino acids, or the status of mTOR, a major regulator of autophagy in response to nutritional starvation."

In addition, the interaction of ZBTB16 and GSK3\u03b2 could be detected, suggesting that ZBTB16 might be a substrate of GSK3\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). A search of Scansite (<a href=\"http://scansite.mit.edu/\">http://scansite.mit.edu</a>) identified three possible sites in ZBTB16 for GSK3\u03b2: S184, T282, and S347. Interestingly, we could detect increased phospho-ZBTB16 under serum starvation condition, and the phosphorylation of ZBTB16 could be inhibited by inhibitors of GSK3\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). We found that S184A mutation, but not S347A mutation, eliminated the phosphorylation of ZBTB16 induced by serum starvation condition detected by pan-phospho-Ser antibody (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>).

We found that serum starvation significantly enhanced auto-ubiquitination of wt ZBTB16, but not S184A/T282A mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Consistently, auto-ubiquitination of S184D/T282E ZBTB16 mutant was significantly enhanced compared to that of wt (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). On the other hand, the abilities of S184A/T282A and S184D/T282E ZBTB16 mutants to mediate the ubiquitination of Atg14L were higher and lower than that of wt, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Since both S184 and T282 are localized in the region of ZBTB16 that is important for binding to Atg14L, we tested the effect of phosphor-mimetic mutation in ZBTB16 on the interaction with Atg14L. Consistently, the interaction of S184D/T282E ZBTB16 mutant with Atg14L was significantly weaker than that of wt (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Finally, to examine if S184/T282 phosphorylation of ZBTB16 might be critical functionally to regulate autophagy under serum starvation condition, we analyzed the response of HeLa cells expressing wt or S184A/T282A mutant to serum starvation. Since endogenous and overexpressed wt ZBTB16 proteins are degraded upon serum starvation while S184A/T282A mutant is not, this experiment provides an opportunity to test if the persistent levels of S184A/T282A mutant under serum starvation condition might be able to suppress the increases in Atg14L and autophagy. Interestingly, we found that the increases in the levels of Atg14L and reduction in that of p62 were blocked by the expression of S184A/T282A (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Thus, we conclude that phosphorylation of S184/T282 of ZBTB16 by GSK3\u03b2 is functionally important for regulating Atg14L under serum starvation condition to promote autophagy."

Surprisingly, we found that heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) was equally effective in reducing the levels of ATG14L induced by serum starvation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). The presence or absence of serum, however, had no effect on the predominant cytoplasmic localization of ZBTB16 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The effect of serum starvation on the increased ATG14L and decreased ZBTB16 levels can also be suppressed by the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with different degree of purity, SDF1, or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which are known GPCR ligands (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013G</a>). In addition, the treatment of other GPCR ligands such as endothelin 1, high density lipoprotein (HDL) could all block the increases in the levels of Atg14L induced by serum starvation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). Since the signaling of SDF1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bleul et al., 1996</a>), LPA (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hecht et al., 1996</a>), endothelin (<a href=\"#bib13\">Horinouchi et al., 2013</a>), HDL (<a href=\"#bib28\">Whorton et al., 2007</a>) is all known to be mediated through GPCRs, these results suggest that the levels of Atg14L are under the control of GPCR signaling."

Our study provides a mechanism of crosstalk between autophagy and proteasome, two major intracellular degradative machineries. Since GPCRs represent the largest family of membrane-bound receptors that can interact with a broad range of ligands, including small organic compounds, eicosanioids, peptides, and proteins (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lagerstr\u00f6m and Schi\u00f6th, 2008</a>), our results suggest that autophagy can be regulated by a much wider range of extracellular signals and conditions beyond starvation condition than currently appreciated. Furthermore, we demonstrate as a proof-of-principle that suppression of GPCR signaling by AMD3100 can activate autophagy to reduce the accumulation of expanded polyglutamine repeats, extend survival, and ameliorate neurodysfunction in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Since our study suggests that ZBTB16-regulated Atg14L ubiquitination and degradation is a common downstream mechanism modulated by GPCR signaling in control of autophagy, our study suggests the possibility to explore regulators of additional GPCRs to manipulate autophagy in the CNS. Since GPCRs represent the most common \u2018druggable\u2019 targets, our results demonstrate a potentially wide range of possible targets for safely modulating the levels of autophagy through pharmacological manipulations of GPCR signaling. Our data, however, do not rule out that GPCRs might regulate additional pathways in control of autophagy; nor do we exclude the possibility that ZBTB16 has substrates, in addition to Atg14L, in regulating autophagy."

In this case, we found that phosphorylation of S184/T282 in the center domain of ZBTB16 by GSK3\u03b2 may provide a signal to disrupt the inhibitory folding and thereby activate its auto-ubiquitination activity. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of S184/T282, which is in the domains of ZBTB16 involved in binding to Atg14L, inhibits its interaction with Atg14L and therefore, reduces the ubiquitination and degradation of Atg14L. Since the interaction of ZBTB16 and Atg14L is mediated by the binding to the BATS domain, a lipid-binding domain that binds to highly curved autophagosome structures enriched with PI3P (<a href=\"#bib21\">Matsunaga et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Fan et al., 2011</a>). Consequently, the interaction of ZBTB16 with Atg14L is potentially competitive with the role of Atg14L in promoting the formation of autophagosomes, consistent with its negative role in regulating autophagy. Thus, the degradation of ZBTB16 upon inhibition of GPCR signaling may not only release Atg14L from proteasomal degradation but also provide a permissive signal to allow the binding of the BATS domain with PI3P, an important event during the formation of autophagosomes."

The activity of this E3 complex is inhibited when ZBTB16 is phosphorylated by GSK3b under starvation conditions. Furthermore, the authors show that the GPCR-cAMP pathway negatively regulates the GSK3b, and thereby promotes degradation of ATG14L. Finally, they demonstrate that AMD3100, a GPCR antagonist, increases the level of ATG14L and autophagic flux, and has a therapeutic effect in a Huntington disease mouse model."
