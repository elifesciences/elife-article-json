The cerebellum plays a critical role in motor control, cognition, and social interaction, suggesting that cerebellar defects likely contribute to NF1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we show that <i>Nf1</i> inactivation during early, but not late stages of cerebellar development, disrupts neuronal lamination, which is partially caused by overproduction of glia and subsequent disruption of the Bergmann glia (BG) scaffold. Specific <i>Nf1</i> inactivation in glutamatergic neuronal precursors causes premature differentiation of granule cell (GC) precursors and ectopic production of unipolar brush cells (UBCs), indirectly disrupting neuronal migration. Transient MEK inhibition during a neonatal window prevents cerebellar developmental defects and improves long-term motor performance of <i>Nf1</i>-deficient mice. This study reveals essential roles of Nf1 in GC/UBC migration by generating correct numbers of glia and controlling GC/UBC fate-specification/differentiation, identifying a therapeutic prevention strategy for multiple NF1-associcated developmental abnormalities."

The cerebellum plays a critical role in motor control, cognition, and social interaction, suggesting that cerebellar defects likely contribute to NF1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we show that <i>Nf1</i> inactivation during early, but not late stages of cerebellar development, disrupts neuronal lamination, which is partially caused by overproduction of glia and subsequent disruption of the Bergmann glia (BG) scaffold. Specific <i>Nf1</i> inactivation in glutamatergic neuronal precursors causes premature differentiation of granule cell (GC) precursors and ectopic production of unipolar brush cells (UBCs), indirectly disrupting neuronal migration. Transient MEK inhibition during a neonatal window prevents cerebellar developmental defects and improves long-term motor performance of <i>Nf1</i>-deficient mice. This study reveals essential roles of Nf1 in GC/UBC migration by generating correct numbers of glia and controlling GC/UBC fate-specification/differentiation, identifying a therapeutic prevention strategy for multiple NF1-associcated developmental abnormalities."

It is caused by mutations in a gene called <i>NF1</i>, which codes for a protein that normally works to inhibit the activity of another protein called Ras. In healthy cells, Ras is needed to stimulate the cells to grow and divide. However, if the Ras protein is not turned off at the right time or if it is activated at the wrong time, it can force cells to keep growing and dividing; this leads to the growth of tumors."

NF1 is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the <i>NF1</i> tumor suppressor gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a negative regulator of proto-oncogene RAS (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cichowski and Jacks, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Upadhyaya and Cooper, 2012</a>). RAS mediates multiple signaling pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schubbert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mendoza et al., 2011</a>). In addition to the development of tumors in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS), neurodevelopmental deficits are highly prevalent among children with NF1, negatively impacting cognition, motor function, and social interaction (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hyman et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Johnson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Krab et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lorenzo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lehtonen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Walsh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Garg et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adviento et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Champion et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Plasschaert et al., 2014</a>). While cognitive impairments associated with NF1 have been well documented, motor dysfunction, social and behavioral deficits including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have only recently been established as common features of NF1 in childhood (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johnson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Krab et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lorenzo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Walsh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Garg et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Champion et al., 2014</a>). Approximately 50\u201380% of children with NF1 have impairments in fine and gross motor function, which can be identified as early as at the toddler stage (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johnson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Krab et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lorenzo et al., 2011</a>). One recent study has shown that impairments of gross motor skills and cognitive functioning in NF1 are often co-morbidities, suggesting the potential existence of a common pathological mechanism underlying both motor and cognitive impairments (<a href=\"#bib10\">Champion et al., 2014</a>)."

About 80% of individuals with ASD exhibit anatomical abnormalities in the cerebellum, among which gliosis and Purkinje cell loss are most commonly identified (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bailey et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Palmen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Vargas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fatemi et al., 2012</a>).

In addition, T2-weighted hyperintensities in the cerebellum are one of the most consistent brain abnormalities observed in individuals with NF1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Feldmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Payne et al., 2014</a>).

Radial glial (RG) stem cells in the ventricular zone of the fourth ventricle (IV\u2013VZ) give rise to all the GABAergic neuronal lineages\u2014Purkinje cells and GABAergic interneurons including small deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), Golgi, basket, and stellate cells (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buffo and Rossi, 2013</a>). Cerebellar astrocytes including Bergmann glia (BG) are also derived from RG cells in the IV-VZ. A secondary germinal zone in the anterior portion of the rhombic lip (RL) generates glutamatergic neuronal lineages, including large DCN, unipolar brush cells (UBCs), and granule cells (GCs) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Englund et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mugnaini et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buffo and Rossi, 2013</a>). At the onset of mouse cerebellar neurogenesis, projection neurons (Purkinje cells and DCN) are first generated between embryonic day 10.5\u201311.5 (E10.5\u201311.5) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hatten, 1999</a>). At E12.5, Math1 (also known as Atoh1)-expressing proliferating precursors migrate out of the RL and spread across the surface of the cerebellum to form the external granule layer (EGL) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hatten, 1999</a>). Around postnatal day 4\u20135 (P4\u20135), GC precursors (GCPs) in the EGL start to exit cell cycle and form a pre-migratory zone along the edge of the EGL. Post-mitotic cells then migrate along the BG scaffold, across the molecular layer (ML), and form the internal granule layer (IGL), where they become mature GCs and form synapses with Purkinje cells through mossy fibers (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hatten, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</a>). Besides GCs, RL-derived Math1<sup>+</sup> precursors also generate the second type of glutamatergic excitatory interneurons, UBCs. UBCs exit the RL at perinatal stages and migrate through the white matter (WM) into the IGL of the cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib14\">Englund et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mugnaini et al., 2011</a>). The molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating migration and lineage specification of GC/UBC precursors remain largely unknown."

However, recent studies have shown that <i>Nf1</i> heterozygous mice exhibit no defect in cerebellum-specific motor tests and that children with NF1 do not appear to have a general dysfunction of the cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib32\">Krab et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">van der Vaart et al., 2011</a>). These observations suggest that mono-allelic <i>NF1</i>/<i>Nf1</i> inactivation is not sufficient to cause developmental and functional deficits in the cerebellum. Thus, we hypothesize that bi-allelic <i>Nf1</i> inactivation in neural stem and progenitor cells during development is required for producing cellular pathologies in the cerebellum. In this study, we utilize four genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models that target bi-allelic <i>Nf1</i> inactivation into different cell lineages or in the same lineage(s) at different stages during cerebellar development. We identify a specific time window of susceptibility of glial and neuronal precursors to <i>Nf1</i> mutation during early, but not late stages of cerebellar development. Accordingly, we develop a transient therapeutic strategy during a neonatal window, which prevents cerebellar developmental defects and provides long-term benefits on motor functions."

Of note, the majority of oligodendrocytes in the cerebellum do not arise from RG cells in the IV-VZ, but from sources in the ventral-lateral mid/hindbrain (that was also targeted by hGFAP-cre) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Grimaldi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mecklenburg et al., 2011</a>). Glutamatergic neurons (including GCs) and glia, but not GABAergic Purkinje cells, were targeted by hGFAP-cre-mediated recombination, revealed by \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) expression of the Rosa26-LacZ reporter and PCR analysis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B,B\u2032</a>) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Soriano, 1999</a>).

Most of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice had ataxic hind limbs and some exhibited a unique \u2018handstand\u2019 behavior during postnatal stages (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The motor dysfunction observed in neural-specific <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice suggests possible defects in the cerebellum. As revealed by Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E;) staining, neuronal lamination in all folia of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum was disrupted with a varying degree of severity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In the severely affected areas (e.g., folia V/VI), the patterning of Calbindin<sup>+</sup> Purkinje cells was disrupted, and failed to form the single Purkinje cell layer (PCL) observed in controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Since hGFAP-cre was not targeted to Purkinje cells, the disorganized Purkinje cells still expressed neurofibromin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2008</a>). Thus, the disrupted patterning of Purkinje cells must be non-cell-autonomous, and secondary to <i>Nf1</i> inactivation in other cerebellar neurons and/or glia. To further confirm the notion, we utilized L7-cre to inactivate <i>Nf1</i> specifically in Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tsai et al., 2012</a>). No overt defect was identified in the <i>Nf1</i><sup>L7</sup>CKO cerebellum, confirming that Nf1 is relatively dispensable in the development of Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>)."

The arrested migration of GCs leads to abnormal neuronal patterning and lamination of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum."

In the control cerebellum, BG cells were located either immediately below or interspersed between Purkinje cell bodies, forming a Purkinje cell and BG (PC/BG) monolayer (arrows, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buffo and Rossi, 2013</a>). In contrast, <i>Nf1</i>-deficient BG cells failed to form a PC/BG monolayer, which appeared to be caused by excess number and mispositioning of BG cells (arrows, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,E\u2032,F</a>). A strong correlation was observed between the severity of neuronal patterning defects and the abnormalities in the number and position of BG cells and the integrity of the PC/BG monolayer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Importantly, the capacity of <i>Nf1</i>-deficient BG cells to extend their processes to the pial surface was relatively uncompromised\u2014this was even true for some of the BG cells that were located in the areas outside the PC/BG layer in the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Based on these results, we propose a model wherein inactivation of <i>Nf1</i> during early embryonic stages overproduces BG cells, thus impairing the formation of the PC/BG monolayer, and consequently, the alignment of the BG scaffold. The defective BG scaffold non-cell-autonomously arrests GC migration and subsequently disrupts Purkinje cell patterning during cerebellar development."

No defect was observed in the overall structure and the distribution of RL-derived Math1<sup>+</sup> neuronal precursors in the EGL, Purkinje cells or BLBP<sup>+</sup> cells in the E17.5 <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, no difference was identified in the number of BLBP<sup>+</sup> RG cells (including proliferating BLBP<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> population) in the IV-VZ (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). However, an increased number of both total BLBP<sup>+</sup> and proliferating BLBP<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells was observed in the prospective white matter (PWM) of the E17.5 <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,A\u2032</a>). More importantly, mitotic index, determined by the ratio of proliferating BLBP<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells to the total BLBP<sup>+</sup> cells, was significantly increased in the E17.5 <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO PWM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,A\u2032</a>). These observations suggest that Nf1 specifically constrains the proliferation of astrocyte precursors in the PWM, but not multipotent RG cells of the IV-VZ in the E17.5 cerebellum. At P0.5, both Purkinje cells and BLBP<sup>+</sup> BG cells (except for those populating future folia IX and X) were situated into a more defined Purkinje cell plate (or rudimentary PC/BG layer); BG cells, particularly those in the anterior cerebellum, underwent differentiation extending their GFAP<sup>+</sup>BLBP<sup>+</sup> fibers to the pial surface (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Unexpectedly, the increased mitotic index was no longer detected in the more differentiated BLBP<sup>+</sup> BG cells in the anterior folia, but only in the posterior folia (IX and X) of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum where BG cells had not formed a rudimentary PC/BG layer at P0.5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,B\u2032,2C,C\u2032</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The differentiation of BG cells was accompanied by the transition of (1) the anatomical location from the PWM to rudimentary PC/BG layer and (2) the subcellular expression of BLBP from nuclei to cytoplasm. Specifically, BLBP staining in the anterior folia of the P0.5 control cerebellum became largely cytoplasmic, while a robust nuclear BLBP staining was typically found in less differentiated BLBP<sup>+</sup> cells in both the E17.5 control and <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum (arrows, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Consistently, an increase of cells with strong nuclear BLBP staining in the P0.5 <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum was identified, suggesting a persistent increase of proliferating BG cells into postnatal stages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Similarly, BLBP<sup>+</sup> cells in the PWM, the precursors of WM astrocytes, still exhibited an increased mitotic index in the P0.5 <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013D\u2032\u2032</a>). At P8 when BG cells had formed a rudimentary PC/BG layer throughout the cerebellum, the mitotic index of BLBP<sup>+</sup> BG cells was no longer increased in the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum, despite a significant increase of both total BLBP<sup>+</sup> and proliferating BLBP<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> BG cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E,E\u2032</a>). Together, these results suggest that Nf1 constrains the proliferation of the BG/astrocyte lineage cells specifically at an intermediate precursor stage located in the PWM, but not at an earlier RG stem cell stage or a more differentiated BG stage, thereby identifying a window of susceptibility of astrocyte precursors to <i>Nf1</i> mutation."

                                "text": "At P8, control BG cells labeled by nuclear Cre staining formed a rudimentary 2 to 3 cell-layer lining within the APC<sup>+</sup> Purkinje cell layer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In contrast, excess BG cells failed to form a similar PC/BG layer, but were aberrantly distributed throughout the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellar cortex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). Consequently, some <i>Nf1</i>-deficient BG cells extended their processes from ectopic locations of the cerebellum including the WM, ML and IGL, accompanied by misalignment of the BG scaffold (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Similar to the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum in adulthood, disrupted patterning of GCs and Purkinje cells often co-existed with the misalignment of BG cells at P8 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Indeed, all major defects observed in BG cells, GCs and Purkinje cells of the adult <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum were identified at P8, suggesting that these defects manifest during neonatal stages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013H\u2032</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013H\u2032\u2032</a>). These results supports a model wherein overproduction of astrocyte precursors during embryonic stages is the primary defect causing both glial and neuronal abnormalities in the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum. To rule out a role of Nf1 in late stages of glial development, we sought to more specifically inactivate <i>Nf1</i> in glial cell lineages during late embryonic stages by employing an inducible system. This inducible system utilized a Nestin-cre<sup>ER</sup> (NCreER) transgene, which can be activated in Nestin-expressing neural stem and progenitor cells by tamoxifen (TM) treatment (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burns et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Upon a single TM pulse at E17.5, NCreER-targeted cells analyzed at P21 were restricted to glial lineage cells in both the control and <i>Nf1</i><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum with only one exception in folium X, where a significant number of both glia and GCs in the IGL were targeted (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Given the sequential differentiation from the anterior to posterior cerebellum, this targeting strategy would inactivate <i>Nf1</i> in more differentiated glial cells in the anterior folia compared to those in the posterior folia. No alteration in the number of BLBP<sup>+</sup> cells or the BG scaffold was observed in any of the anterior folia (I to V) between the control and <i>Nf1</i><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Furthermore, neurons did not abnormally accumulate in the ML of the anterior <i>Nf1</i><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO folia (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,A\u2032</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D,D\u2032</a>). In folium X, the number of <i>Nf1</i>-deficient BLBP<sup>+</sup> cells (BLBP<sup>+</sup>\u03b2-gal<sup>+</sup>) was significantly increased, though this was subtle compared to the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Indeed, the other posterior folia (e.g., VI\u2013IX) exhibited a slightly, but significantly increased number of <i>Nf1</i>-deficient BLBP<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,C\u2032</a>). The overproduction of BLBP<sup>+</sup>\u03b2-gal<sup>+</sup> BG cells in the posterior folia of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum appeared to be caused by cell-autonomous <i>Nf1</i> inactivation, as the number of non-NCreER-targeted BLBP<sup>+</sup>\u03b2-gal<sup>-</sup> cells in the same areas was not altered (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Importantly, the overproduction of BLBP<sup>+</sup> BG cells was accompanied by focal misalignment of the BG scaffold and abnormal accumulation of both <i>Nf1</i>-deficient (NeuN<sup>+</sup>\u03b2-gal<sup>+</sup>) and <i>Nf1</i>-intact (NeuN<sup>+</sup>\u03b2-gal<sup>\u2212</sup>) neurons in the ML of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). These results suggest that overproduction of this particular astrocytic lineage causes impaired formation of the PC/BG monolayer and BG scaffold, non-cell-autonomously arresting GC migration."

                                "text": "To determine whether Nf1 also plays a cell-autonomous role in the glutamatergic neuronal lineages, we utilized Math1-cre, which specifically targets Math1<sup>+</sup> neuronal precursors in the developing RL that give rise to both GCs and UBCs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Englund et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schuller et al., 2008</a>). Math1-cre-mediated recombination was almost exclusively restricted to the cells in the IGL of the adult cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Double staining of \u03b2-gal and other lineage markers showed that \u03b2-gal<sup>+</sup> cells were restricted to GCs in the IGL, but not Purkinje cells or glial cells, including BG cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,B\u2032</a>). No defect in Purkinje cells or glial cells, particularly the BG scaffold, was observed in the adult <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,B\u2032</a>). Consequently, unlike the severely disrupted <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum, the <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum was relatively unimpaired (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, the <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum did exhibit one major defect observed in the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum\u2014abnormal accumulation of cells in the ML including some on the pial surface (arrows, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B\u2013B\u2032\u2032</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,A\u2032</a>). The number of NeuN<sup>+</sup>\u03b2-gal<sup>+</sup>, but not NeuN<sup>+</sup>\u03b2-gal<sup>\u2212</sup> neurons, was significantly increased, suggesting that the increased neuronal density in the ML of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum was caused by abnormal accumulation of <i>Nf1</i>-deficient NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons in a cell-autonomous manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B,B\u2032\u2032</a>). Despite that no defect in the BG scaffold was observed, abnormal accumulation of neurons was evident in the ML of the P8 <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum, suggesting a developmental defect during neonatal stages (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To investigate the mechanism underlying the arrested migration of <i>Nf1</i>-deficient GCs, we performed BrdU pulse-chase experiments to determine the time course of the differentiation and migration of newly generated GCs during neonatal stages. We analyzed P8 control and <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebella 24, 32 and 48 hr after BrdU pulse by determining the location and differentiation status of BrdU-labeled cells. 24 hr after pulse, BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in both the control and <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum remained exclusively in the EGL and exhibited similar cell cycle profiles, suggesting that Nf1 is not required for proliferation and cell-cycle exit of GC precursors (GCPs) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013C\u2032\u2032</a>). However, 32 hr after BrdU pulse, a subset of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the control cerebellum started departing from the EGL and entered the ML, not yet reaching the IGL (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). While migrating GCs in the control ML did not express MAP2, a marker for mature GCs in the IGL, and had nuclei with a spindle-shaped migrating morphology, many BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO ML already acquired MAP2 expression with rounded nuclei\u2014typical neuronal differentiation features for mature GCs in the IGL (arrows, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,C\u2032</a>). After 48-hr BrdU pulse, BrdU<sup>+</sup>MAP2<sup>+</sup> cells in the <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum progressively accumulated in the ML and EGL whereas control BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells did not express MAP2 until they reached the IGL (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D,D\u2032</a>). Newly generated neurons were abnormally accumulated in the ML/EGL of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum, leading to an increased number of differentiated BrdU<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>\u2212</sup> and p27<sup>+</sup> cells in the ML/EGL with a concomitant reduction in the IGL (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E,E\u2032,F,F\u2032</a>). These observations suggest that a subset of <i>Nf1</i>-deficient GCPs undergo accelerated and premature neuronal differentiation, thereby arresting their migration in the EGL and ML. This conclusion was further supported by in vitro studies. 2 days after being plated in culture, significantly more <i>Nf1</i>-deficient GCPs expressed MAP2 than control cells, confirming an accelerated neuronal differentiation rate in a cell-autonomous manner (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1G,G\u2032</a>). Importantly, <i>Nf1</i>-deficient GCs could efficiently interact with wild-type glia in a co-culture system and migrated normally in a trans-well migration assay (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1H,H\u2032</a>). Together, both in vivo and in vitro assays argue that instead of causing defects directly on migration, <i>Nf1</i> inactivation promotes premature neuronal differentiation of a subset of GCPs, leading to abnormal accumulation of differentiated neurons in the ML and EGL."

UBCs are the other known RL-derived glutamatergic interneurons that are enriched in folia responsible for vestibular motor function (folia IX and X) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mugnaini et al., 2011</a>). While GCs arise from GCPs in the EGL and migrate across ML to IGL between P4\u2013P21, Tbr2<sup>+</sup> UBCs exit the RL during late embryonic stages, and then migrate through the PWM into the IGL until P10 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Englund et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mugnaini et al., 2011</a>). While Tbr2<sup>+</sup> UBCs were rarely identified in the control ML (<a href=\"#bib15\">Englund et al., 2006</a>), Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells including the newly generated Tbr2<sup>+</sup>BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were readily identified in the P8 <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO EGL and ML (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,E\u2032,F,F\u2032</a>).

It should be noted that the number of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> UBCs was not significantly different between the control and the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum. The distinction between Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> and Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> UBC populations was further supported by the different percentage of these two types of UBCs expressing a high level of Calretinin (CR<sup>high</sup>). CR<sup>high</sup> is a marker for a subset of UBCs due to its low expression in granule cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mugnaini et al., 2011</a>). Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs in the ML and IGL of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum expressed CR<sup>high</sup> at a significantly lower percentage (36% and 38%) than Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> UBCs (67%) typically observed in the IGL (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,A\u2032</a>). Importantly, the absolute number of Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs was similar in the ML of folium V between the <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO and <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum, further supporting the notion that ectopic generation of these UBCs results from loss of cell-autonomous Nf1 function in the glutamatergic neuronal lineages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I\u2032</a>). Similar to the <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum, ectopic Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs were continuously generated in the ML and IGL of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum during postnatal stages (arrows, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B,B\u2032,C,C\u2032</a>), well beyond the developmental window of the generation of control Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> UBCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J,J\u2032</a>). Together, these observations demonstrate that the Tbr2<sup>+</sup> UBCs ectopically generated in both the <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO and <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum are different from those previously described in the normal cerebellum in 6 critical aspects: (1) the marker expression, Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> vs Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup>, (2) the low vs high percentage expressing CR<sup>high</sup>, (3) the location, ML and IGL vs IGL, (4) the developmental origin, precursors in the EGL vs RL, (5) the timing of birth, neonatal vs embryonic stages, and (6) the migratory pathway, EGL-ML-IGL vs RL-PWM-IGL. Thus, we suggest the existence of two UBC sublineages. Importantly, the majority of GABAR\u03b16-negative neurons were Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells, while no significant difference was observed in GABAergic neurons between the control and <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D,E,E\u2032</a>). These observations suggest that Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs are the major contributors to the non-GCs abnormally accumulated in the ML of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013D\u2032\u2032</a>)."

Similarly, Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs were indeed increased in the IGL of <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO folium X, and thus the reduction of Tbr2<sup>+</sup> UBCs was exclusively attributed to a decreased number of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> UBCs in the IGL (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,D\u2032</a>).

Instead, abnormal accumulation of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> UBCs in the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO WM was evident at P8, a time point when normal UBCs had already migrated through the PWM and entered the IGL (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D,D\u2032</a>). Together, these results suggest that the abnormal accumulation of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> UBCs in the WM of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum was caused by arrested migration of UBCs in the PWM on the way from the RL to the IGL during neonatal development (<a href=\"#bib15\">Englund et al., 2006</a>)."

Although Western blot analysis showed a significant reduction of neurofibromin expression, Erk/MAPK was the only downstream signaling pathway that was consistently hyperactivated in <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebella (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Consistent with the specificity of Math1-cre transgene, cell cultures with enriched P6 GCPs showed almost a complete loss of neurofibromin expression with a robust increase of Erk activation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2032</a>). A high level of phosphorylated Erk (p-Erk) expression was observed in a subset of IGL cells, while a low level in the ML and a complete absence of p-Erk in the EGL was found in the control cerebellum at P8 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The pattern of p-Erk expression is consistent with a possible role of a high level of Erk signaling in neuronal differentiation. A robust increase of p-Erk expression was observed in the P8 <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum including the inner edge of the EGL (pre-migratory zone), the ML, and IGL (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Importantly, the NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons abnormally accumulated in the ML of the P8 <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum expressed a high level of p-Erk (arrows, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These results demonstrate that Nf1 is a major regulator that suppresses Erk signaling in migrating GCs in the pre-migratory EGL and migratory zone (ML) of the developing cerebellum. To test whether hyperactive Erk signaling is responsible for <i>Nf1</i>-deficient GCPs to undergo premature differentiation and ectopically adopt a UBC fate, we treated newborn control and <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO pups with a MEK inhibitor (PD0325901) or vehicle from P0.5 to P21 for 3 weeks (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). This 3-week treatment protocol exhibited no adverse effect on normal cerebellar development, but reduced p-Erk expression in both MEKi-treated control and <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebella (data not shown). Strikingly, MEK inhibition completely eliminated ectopic Tbr2 expression in the ML of MEKi-treated <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebella (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). MEK inhibition consistently reduced over 60% of abnormally accumulated neurons in the ML of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,C\u2032</a>). Since an increase of p-S6 staining was also identified in purified GCPs from the P6 <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2032</a>), we treated control and <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO mice with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib25\">Guertin and Sabatini, 2009</a>). Rapamycin treatment had no benefit on neuronal defects in the <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum, but caused adverse effects on neuronal migration in both the control and mutant cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together, these results demonstrate that Nf1-mediated MEK/Erk inhibition is the major mechanism underlying the suppression of a subset of GCPs that otherwise would undergo premature differentiation and ectopically adopt a UBC fate in the developing cerebellum."

The MEKi-treated <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice displayed a varying degree of therapeutic responses in glial and neuronal defects in the developing cerebellum as well as their general behaviors (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Of 14 MEKi-treated <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebella analyzed, 9 mice (good-responders or G-responders) exhibited a significant rescue in the number of neurons abnormally accumulated in the ML of the developing cerebellum at a level similar to what was achieved in the MEKi-treated <i>Nf1</i><sup>Math1</sup>CKO mice (green color, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013A\u2032\u2032</a>). However, the remaining 5 of the MEKi-treated <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice (poor-responders or P-responders) only exhibited marginal improvement in the neuronal defect (yellow color, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013A\u2032\u2032</a>). Importantly, G- and P-responders could be readily distinguished by the presence or absence of rescues (to the control levels) in the number of BG cells, alignment of the BG scaffold, the number of mispositioned Purkinje cells and arrested UBCs in the WM (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B,B\u2032,C,C\u2032</a>). It should be noted that both G-responders and P-responders exhibited a complete rescue of ectopic Tbr2 expression in the ML of the MEKi-treated <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,D\u2032</a>). Therefore, the fundamental difference in the cerebella of G- and P-responders lies in the presence or absence of rescue in glia-dependent cerebellar defects, which could result from inconsistent inhibition of much higher levels of hyperactive Erk signaling in <i>Nf1</i>-deficient glial lineage cells than that in <i>Nf1</i>-deficient immature neurons in the ML (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

Compared to the other two major CNS cell types, neurons and oligodendrocytes, the identity of astrocyte precursors remains poorly understood. This is largely due to a lack of known markers that can reliably define astrocytes at distinct developmental stages (<a href=\"#bib44\">Molofsky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Freeman and Rowitch, 2013</a>). BG cells have a unique and well-defined migratory pathway coupled with differentiation that allows us to define the role of Nf1 in this particular astrocyte lineage at different developmental stages (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buffo and Rossi, 2013</a>). Before becoming terminally differentiated in the PC/BG monolayer, BG precursors proliferate at three distinct stages of differentiation that can be distinguished by different anatomical locations during development (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). These three stages include: Stage I, RG/early-precursor stage in the IV-VZ; Stage II, BG intermediate-precursor stage in the PWM; Stage III, BG late-precursor stage in the rudimentary PC/BG layer. In the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum, increased proliferation was not observed in E17.5 IV-VZ RG cells (Stage I), or in BG late-precursors following migration into the rudimentary PC/BG layer in P0.5 anterior folia, or throughout P8 folia (Stage III). In contrast, a significant increase of proliferation index was specifically identified in <i>Nf1</i>-deficient BG intermediate-precursors in the E17.5 PWM and P0.5 posterior folia (Stage II), leading to an increased number of both total BLBP<sup>+</sup> and proliferating BLBP<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells. These observations suggest that Nf1 plays a robust role in constraining BG proliferation specifically at an intermediate precursor stage (Stage II), but not during earlier or later stages (Stage I or Stage III). This conclusion is further confirmed by acute inactivation of <i>Nf1</i> in the E17.5 developing cerebellum using an inducible <i>Nf1</i><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO model. Thus, the temporal and regional phenotypic differences upon <i>Nf1</i> loss observed in the BG lineage can be strictly attributed to differences in the differentiation status of this particular astrocyte lineage. Moreover, <i>Nf1</i>-deficient astrocytes in the developing WM also exhibited increased proliferation. Since gliogenesis occurs at different time points in different regions of the developing brain, this \u2018differentiation-based\u2019 model might provide an explanation for conflicting results on the role of Nf1 in neural stem and progenitor cells among previously published studies (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dasgupta and Gutmann, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hegedus et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Becher and Holland, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lee da et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lee da et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). It should be noted that region-specific mechanisms underlying glial pathologies induced by <i>Nf1</i> loss do exist within the dorsal brain. While increased proliferation in <i>Nf1</i>-deficient astrocyte precursors appears to be responsible for the increase of glial cells in the dorsal hindbrain (e.g., cerebellum), altered fate-specification of <i>Nf1</i>-deficient neural stem and progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle causes the increase of glial cells in the corpus callosum by promoting gliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2012</a>)."

Loss of function studies in mice have shown that receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, particularly fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling, is essential for the transition from RG to BG cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Muller Smith et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Meier et al., 2014</a>). Most strikingly, loss of Shp2, also known as Ptpn11 (Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 11), completely blocks the transition from RG to BG cells, which can be rescued by constitutively active MEK (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2014</a>). These studies suggest that activation of Shp2-dependent FGF/MEK/Erk signaling is essential for the transition from RG to BG cells during cerebellar development (from Stage I to II). Accordingly, our study suggests that Erk signaling must be constrained by pathway inhibitors such as Nf1 to ensure the generation of the correct number of BG cells. Consistently, the most robust Erk/MAPK activation upon Nf1 loss was observed in astrocyte precursors at Stage II and early Stage III (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>)."

First, in the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum, the severity of glial and neuronal defects is not uniform, but highly correlated with the excess number of BG cells in the affected areas. Indeed, the capacity of <i>Nf1</i>-deficient BG cells to extend their radial fibers appeared relatively uncompromised even for those projected from the areas outside of the PC/BG layer. Second, considering the time required for TM induced, Cre-mediated <i>Nf1</i> deletion at E17.5 and the half-life of neurofibromin protein, we expect that a complete loss of Nf1 would be fully achieved in targeted cells around P0.5 when BG cells in the anterior folia (I\u2013V) are at Stage III, while BG cells in the posterior folia (IX and X) are still proliferating in the PWM at Stage II. Consistently, a significant increase of <i>Nf1</i>-deficient BG cells was observed in the posterior folia (IX, X), but not in the anterior folia of the same <i>Nf1</i><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum. Moreover, failed formation of the PC/BG monolayer, misalignment of the BG scaffold, and abnormal accumulation of both <i>Nf1</i>-intact and <i>Nf1</i>-deficient neurons in the ML were only observed in the posterior folia of the E17.5 TM-induced <i>Nf1</i><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum. It should be noted that glial and neuronal defects in the posterior folia of the E17.5 TM-induced <i>Nf1</i><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum are significantly less severe than those observed in the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum. This is likely due to a relatively greater window for the expansion of <i>Nf1</i>-deficient glial precursors in the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum (from E12.5 on) than E17.5 TM-induced <i>Nf1</i><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum. Third, transient treatment of MEKi exhibited a robust long-term rescue of glial and neuronal defects in the cerebella of G-responders in which neurons and glia were still deficient for <i>Nf1</i> after the treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that as long as the excess number of glia is therapeutically fixed during a specific window of cerebellar development, a long-term rescue could be achieved, as Nf1 is relatively dispensable for glial cell proliferation during late stages of development and adulthood."

One UBC sublineage characterized by Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> is relatively well studied, which exit cell cycles during perinatal stages and migrate from the RL via the PWM to the IGL (<a href=\"#bib15\">Englund et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mugnaini et al., 2011</a>). Although Nf1-regulated glial number is essential for the migration of this UBC sublineage through the PWM, Nf1 is not required for the generation and migration of the Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> UBC sublineage. In contrast, the other rare Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBC sublineage appears to be suppressed by Nf1-regulated Erk signaling in GCPs in a cell-autonomous mechanism. Thus, our study demonstrates that Nf1 is indirectly required for GC migration by suppressing GCPs to undergo premature terminal differentiation and ectopic differentiation to Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs in the EGL and ML. It is still possible that <i>Nf1</i> loss causes abnormal migration of the Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> sublineage from the RL to the EGL, and then switches them to the Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBC sublineage in the EGL. However, no Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells were found in the EGL of the mutant cerebellum at E17.5 or P0.5, when Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> UBCs migrate out of the RL into the PWM (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C,C\u2032</a>). This observation argues against the possibility of abnormal migration of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> UBCs into the EGL. Indeed, <i>Nf1</i> loss has little or no impact on the generation, migration and total number of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> UBCs in the mutant cerebellum. Furthermore, in contrast to the precursors of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>\u2212</sup> UBCs that exit cell cycles during perinatal stages, <i>Nf1</i>-deficient precursors of Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs continue proliferating in the EGL at least until P8 at the peak of GCP proliferation. Together, these observations suggest that Nf1 plays a specific role in the Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBC sublineage by controlling the fate-specification of GCPs in differentiating into GCs vs Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs. The involvement of UBCs in cerebellar vestibular functions raises the possibility that the UBC defects in these <i>Nf1</i> GEM models could contribute to the impairments of motor and balance observed in individuals with NF1 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mugnaini et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Champion et al., 2014</a>)."

The inconsistent rescue in the glia-dependent defects observed in the cerebella of MEKi-treated <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice is likely due to the extremely high levels of Erk activation in <i>Nf1</i>-deficient glial cells in the developing cerebellum compared to other cells. Indeed, when the dose of MEKi was increased to 20 mg/kg, a more consistent rescue in cerebellar defects was observed in the cerebella of the MEKi-treated <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). More importantly, this \u2018MEKi in milk\u2019 treatment protocol provides robust long-term rescues on cerebellar developmental defects and motor performance. It should be emphasized that this transient MEKi treatment protocol also rescued structural defects in the other regions of the <i>Nf1</i><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO brain including the enlarged corpus callosum, a brain structural defect associated with severe cognitive impairments in a subset of NF1 patients (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Thus, motor performance improvement by this protocol is a collective reflection of rescues of multiple NF1-associated brain structural defects including those in the cerebellum and corpus callosum. Given that cognitive and motor impairments are often co-morbidities in children with NF1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Champion et al., 2014</a>), our findings suggest that this transient \u2018MEKi in milk\u2019 protocol can serve as a common prevention strategy for multiple NF1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders."

For example, the hGFAP-Cre driver line generates strong recombination astrocytes in many brain structures, including the hippocampus, and corpus callosum. Math-1 mediated Cre recombination has not been extensively characterized, but Math1 is known to be required for development of a range of brainstem neurons involved in proprioception, interoception, hearing and arounsal Rose et al, 2009). The authors have made little effort to make the reader aware of these facts, and how they may affect the interpretation of their data. While this point is unlikely to be important for evaluation of anatomical defects in cerebellar development, the behavioral data they have provided must be considered in the light of this knowledge. The authors should substantively revise the manuscript to educate the reader with regard to these points, the potential impact they have on our interpretation of this work, and their considerations regarding the potential therapeutic effects of MEKi."

Of course, these cells might represent GCs that are mis-specified, as the authors have suggested. Alternatively, they could represent ectopic UBCs that were correctly specified in the rhombic lip, but followed an abnormal migratory path to arrive in the EGL and ML. The fact that they are labeled in the EGL by BrDU does not distinguish between these two possibilities. In my opinion, much more precise and detailed characterization of these ectopic cells would have to be done to conclude that they are mis-specified."

To minimize the effect of genetic background, we analyzed control and mutant mice among littermates.

For example, the hGFAP-Cre driver line generates strong recombination astrocytes in many brain structures, including the hippocampus, and corpus callosum. Math-1 mediated Cre recombination has not been extensively characterized, but Math1 is known to be required for development of a range of brainstem neurons involved in proprioception, interoception, hearing and arounsal Rose et al, 2009). The authors have made little effort to make the reader aware of these facts, and how they may affect the interpretation of their data. While this point is unlikely to be important for evaluation of anatomical defects in cerebellar development, the behavioral data they have provided must be considered in the light of this knowledge. The authors should substantively revise the manuscript to educate the reader with regard to these points, the potential impact they have on our interpretation of this work, and their considerations regarding the potential therapeutic effects of MEKi</i>."

Therefore, behavioral data are a collective reflection of rescues of multiple NF1-associated brain structural defects including those in the cerebellum and corpus callosum. Indeed, this is one of the major strengths of this transient MEKi treatment protocol that could potentially exert therapeutic benefits on multiple NF1-associated brain structural defects including both defects in the cerebellum and other brain regions (which are targeted by hGFAP-cre, as this reviewer pointed out).
